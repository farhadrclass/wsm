I have read Susan Wiggs before, and was mildly entertained, but this one kind of read like she wrote it in her sleep. I don't read a lot of romance novels, but when I do, I pick them not for the rugged handsomeness of their heroes, but usually for the professions of the heroines (examples: antique dealers, home renovators, cooks, farmers, booksellers - you get the idea), so when I read the blurb on this one I thought, \"Jackpot! She's starting a cooking school and raises bees!\". Sadly, these details were not enough to make up for the way the story kind of only lightly touched down on any of the plot-lines. There was promise there: WW11 Danish Resistance adventures in flashback, a smarmy and abusive ex (who shows up threateningly at the beginning and just kind of lurks around on the edges until he gets his comeuppance off-stage), a hero whose career hints of war-torn journalistic excitement (which is barely gone into). None of these things ever really got beyond the kernel-of-an-idea stage. And the romantic interludes just annoyed me. Any kiss that is described as \"sexy\" just makes me roll my eyes."}, {"userName": "Gerri Sutter-Lauzon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20094198-gerri-sutter-lauzon", "userReview": "I just finished this book after starting it yesterday. I had a hard time putting it down so I could get some sleep last night. I loved this book. It was a tender, gentle love story about an interesting family. Isobel and Mac are the main characters. She's a homebody, close to her grandfather and living in the family fruit farm in California that is in the process of being renovated into a bed and breakfast/cooking school (Isobel's passion). Mac is a well known author, there to write her grandfather's story. There are secrets. Some old, some new. All affect who and what the characters are and will be. Isobel and Mac start out strangers, become friends, and as they begin to share their secrets, become lovers. I finished it with such a good feeling about it. There is history involved, that made the book even more interesting. Please, read this book.You won't be disappointed.

I thought the back story of the elder people during the war was as interesting or even more so than the present day story.

It is another book that highlights the love of unconventional families and the love that can be found. This time the story is focused on Isabel and her dream of starting a kitchen school. However her dreams are added to the list of things to do while preparing for her sister\u2019s wedding, finding a beekeeper, saving a famous writer Cormac O'Neill from dying from bee stings, and hearing the story about her grandfather\u2019s past during WWII in Denmark. If that isn\u2019t enough, Isabel is falling for the famous writer \u2013 not that she knows he is famous - while he is falling for her. Susan Wiggs manages to bring us to the land of apples and honey, while exposing the lengths that many people went through in WWII. She exposes us to understanding farm to table cooking while whetting our appetite with lots of yummy foods made with honey. This is a wonderful follow up to The Apple Orchard as it exposes us to more and more of the family and people that inhabit and love Bella Vista. The Beekeeper's Ball will be out in July."}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "I enjoyed Susan\u2019s \u201cThe Apple Orchard\u201d (Bella Vista Chronicles, #1), and was delighted to receive an advanced reading copy of \u201cThe Beekeeper's Ball\u201d (Bella Vista Chronicles #2), as a continuation of thirty year old Isabel, as she transforms her childhood home (Bella Vista), a gathering place for friends and family, for reunions and celebrations. In addition her dreams, the Bella Vista Cooking School\u2014a unique place for other dreamers to come, and learn the culinary arts\u2014all while she leaves her past behind with controlling Calvin. As a chef, she is turning the magical Bella Vista's rambling mission-style hacienda, apple orchards, bountiful gardens and beehives, into an idyllic venue, while she forgets the past. All sorts of fun things: magazine covers, gourmet cooking, literary agents, wedding plans, photo shoots, stylist, vintage items, delightful cuisine, local gourmet markets, antiques, wine, honey, figs, plus more in this blooming Sonoma setting (I want to be there-like now)! Everything is going as planned until delicious and sexy Cormac (Mac) comes into the picture (EpiPen included), to dig up old history of Magnus Johansen (Isabel\u2019s grandfather-a key player in the Danish Resistance) sent by Tess. He has traveled to many places in his life from war-torn places of the world, airports and grimy cities, and long barren stretches of scorched earth in the foreign lands; however, none compare to the lush and seductive Bella Vista. His goal was simple after his injury--- heal, gather the information about Magnus the war hero turned orchardist, then settle in and write his story, as after all this is what he does well. As this hunk slowly lets down his rough outer guard to soften and enjoy the pleasures of this sleepy small town, along with Isabell\u2019s charm in the kitchen- a man worth getting to know. From the 1940s in Copenhagen to the present time, Susan seamlessly blends the old with the new with an incredible, magical, and inspiring story-- keeping you reading well into the night. Would definitely recommend reading both books in the series; however, they could serve as a standalone; hoping for a third to come! As a longtime fan of Susan, her books and writing style, she has a way of drawing her readers into the setting, with strong family historical dynamics and romance. A delicious read, well-written, with family secrets, adventure, summer days and nights, a family wedding (Tess/Dominic), a Beekeeper\u2019s Ball, and unexpected love.A special thank you to Harlequin MIRA and NetGalley for an advanced reading copy, in exchange for an unbiased and honest review."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "Having read the Apple Orchard, which I suggest you read first, this novel brings us back to Bella Vista and some of the same characters. This time the main character is Isabel who was my favourite character in the Apple Orchard. So I was interested to read more about her and she did not disappoint. She is not only setting up a cooking school at Bella Vista and organising the wedding of her half sister Tess, but she is also involved with bee keeping and producing honey. Into Bella Vista comes Cormac O\u2019Neill, a friend of Tess and also a famous journalist who is writing the story of Tess and Isabel\u2019s grandfather Magnus. For those of us who had read The Apple Orchard there was a little bit of overlap of some parts of the back story concerning Magnus and World War 2, but also plenty that was new. I liked the character of Annelise and also Jamie. I thought it was a shame we didn\u2019t get to hear more of Jamie and the birth of her baby but perhaps that is for the next book in this series. I thought Cormac, (Mac) was a little stereotypical and just a bit too much of the hunky male. The scene early in the book with the bees had me chuckling.Probably because I liked Isabel more than I did Tess, I found this more enjoyable than The Apple Orchard.For those into cooking there are recipes included using honey and lavender. Since neither are things I ever would use, I ignored those. But if you\u2019re into cooking you might enjoy them as well as this love and family story with its interesting historical information."}, {"userName": "Elvan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3769293-elvan", "userReview": "[ A ready made villain in Calvin Sharp, the culinary school prof who reels in then assaults a young impressionable Isabella is left off page for the majority of the novel.

Although I do have a few tiffs with this book, I still gave it 5 stars. It is a wonderful story that weaves back between the grandfather's experience in occupied Denmark and Isabella's struggle to find love.My tiffs with the book1. Dominic is completely missing from this book. I think he has about 4 conversation lines right before the bridal shower. Other than that, he is mentioned in name, and in passing.2. His children are also absent, which shocked me since they did spend time at Bella Vista in the last book.3. I liked Jamie, but she seemed forced in the beginning of the book. Then I started to like her and wanted to know more. But her role seemed to taper of at the end. After she decides what she wants to do with her baby her storyline seems to platu. 4. There are a few stories that are just not told. Eva's, Romanoe's, Isabella's mother. Will they be in future books? I don't know.5. The ending. Holy crap....

The writing was very young, like I was reading my 10 year old's book report. Lots of errors and things that didn't make sense after book one. I wonder who edited the book. Felt phoned in.

I fell in love with the charming fictional town in the first book, THE APPLE ORCHARD. Susan Wiggs\u2019 gorgeous descriptions of Sonoma County make me want to jump inside her books.THE BEEKEEPER\u2019S BALL picks up where the first book left off. Sisters Tess and Isabel are planning Tess\u2019 wedding at the family estate called Bella Vista. Isabel is also living out her dream of opening a cooking school in their home. Isabel is a workaholic and a bit of a hermit. She\u2019s been hiding out at Bella Vista for years because of a painful experience in her past. Along comes Cormac (Mac) O\u2019Neill, a battered journalist hired to write her grandfather\u2019s life story, and he challenges her to shed her protective cocoon.The story alternates between present-day Archangel and World War II Denmark. More family secrets are revealed as Magnus shares his past as part of the Danish resistance movement. I liked how we got some answers to questions from the first book, though the author leaves us with a major unresolved twist at the end!! I can only hope this means there\u2019s a 3rd book in the works.The romance in this book was okay \u2013 not the greatest. Maybe the chemistry between Mac and Isabel was lacking, or maybe their story was overshadowed by the World War II parts. This book didn\u2019t flow as smoothly or have as strong a focus as the first. Still, I thought it was a good read, and like I said before, I\u2019m hopeful there will be another book to tie up the surprise loose ends. 3.5 stars.Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Penny McGill", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7033258-penny-mcgill", "userReview": "This is a lovely book. So relaxing. A wonderful choice for someone about to go on an airplane ride they don't want to take because just dipping into the pages is enough to transport you to another world. Turbulence? Don't feel it. Ice on the wings? Not noticing any of that creepy chemical smell as they remove it. Such a world in this book. A beautiful villa with honey bees, a busy construction site, an upcoming wedding, a few family secrets, many delicious recipes discussed and eaten and a very handsome man who may or may not be falling for the main character. It's all there in one sweet little story.This book was passed on to me by a library patron who said it was the second in a series but didn't have to be read in order because each of this author's books could be read as a stand alone novel. She was right. I enjoyed this little trip into the world of Susan Wiggs so much that I am going to keep her on reserve. I'll just dash back in there any time I need a boost. It's enough of a story to keep you turning the pages but nothing so dark to make you worry as you turn them. There is a little bit of heat in this romance - just enough - but the balance of the book is just about a family that you are happy to get to know. Like a long weekend in a pleasant B&B.

Unfortunately this wasn't as good as the first book as it wasn't a straight romance. Well I guess it was just not of the main characters (or who you think is the main character). It turned out to be more Magnus' story than Isabel's. While I liked Magnus' story, I felt that it completely overshadowed Isabel's budding romance with Cormac O'Neill. I thought the chemistry was scorching hot between Isabel and Mac and I was really glad that they compromised enough to make their happily ever after happen. I was disappointed in how the whole Calvin Sharpe situation was handled (or not handled). I liked that Annalise and Magnus recalling such horrific memories finally allowed Isabel to open up about what happened to her at chef school. Turns out her solution was the perfect end-all of Calvin Sharpe. Things weren't really finished though the book was and since this was published in 2014, I'll keep hoping a third book pops up to tidy up all those loose ends especially Jamie because that poor girl needs her HEA in a bad way."}, {"userName": "Janga", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1206531-janga", "userReview": "The second novel in Wiggs\u2019s Bella Vista series offers the same strong sense of place that characterized the first book. The scenes and the scents and the textures of life at Bella Vista give the reader the sense of having visited this idyllic spot. Both Isabel and Mac are likeable characters, and watching them fall in love is a delight. They have enough in common to enable the reader to believe that more than their desire for one another unites them, and yet the difference between Mac, a diplomat\u2019s son who has spent his entire life wandering the globe, and Isabel, whose heart and memories are inextricably entangled with Bella Vista, is great enough to cast doubt on a happy resolution.Magnus\u2019s story is compelling and poignant on many levels, and it contributes to the richly developed theme of the intrusion of the past on the present. Readers who enjoyed The Apple Orchard will be happy to see more of Tess and Dominic. Some threads are resolved, and others are left tantalizingly unresolved.

Saved by Tess' talent in ferreting out hidden treasures, Bella Vista has been saved and is being transformed into Isobel Johansen's dream - a Destination Cooking School. The old home has plenty of rooms to accommodate the future enterprise. And Isobel is feverishly working on the details and on Tess's wedding. Tess wants a celebration, rather than the traditional wedding. She's throwing The Beekeeper's Ball. Also, the sister's grandfather is ready to tell his story. Enter the handsome internationally acclaimed writer, Cormac O'Neill. Oh dear! Poor Isobel. They don't start on the right foot, shall we say. Bee stings and an allergic reaction don't make for a great welcome or a first impression. The sisters are very surprised that Annelise Winther plays an important role into their grandfather's story.

The first book in this series is The Apple Orchard.The Beekeeper's Ball is Isabel's story. She is planning on turning Bella Vista into a cooking school and also adding beekeeping to the property's assets. She takes in a pregnant beekeeper named Jamie, whom I think may be featured in a future book of this series. Bella Vista is preparing the apple Orchard for Tess and Dominic's wedding, renovations are taking place for the future opening of Isabel's cooking school and a well-known journalist named Mac has arrived to write about Magnus, the grandfather, which allows for more secrets of the past to be revealed and additional insight into what Magnus, Eva and Annelise endured during WWII.There wasn't a lot of Tess or Dominic in this book, but their story was covered in the first book. There's more information revealed about Francesca, Isabel's mother and Erik, Tess and Isabel's father. Some of the information about Magnus and the war felt a bit repetitive after just reading The Apple Orchard, but if you're reading this book a year later l can see why the author reiterated some of the history to refresh the reader's memory. I didn't feel like I got to know Isabel as much as I got to know Tess in the first book. Isabel is a very guarded character and maybe that is why I felt this way. Much of the telling of Isabel's past felt like there were a lot of details missing. At times I even felt like the book focused more on Magnus' than on Isabel. I guess I wanted more of the present day than the past in this book since there was a lot of history presented in the first book. I enjoy the setting of this series tremendously having never been to the West coast myself. It is fun to be taken away to a beautiful place like Bella Vista. Although I enjoy the taste of history within this series, I hope the next book is more focused on present day events than the past."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1031643-amanda", "userReview": "Totally cheesy chic-lit.

Why? First, she focuses on the Danish resistance fighters, a little-known aspect of WWII, without ignoring German atrocities against the Jews. More importantly, the key focus is on the contemporary lives of the individuals involved and the secrets and lies that interweave their lives, both past and present.Bella Vista has apple orchards and bee hives and a hacienda that is being transformed into a destination for weddings and a cooking school, all overseen by Isabel, the first of two daughters. Her secrets keep her hidden away in Bella Vista, that is, hidden from any chance at love or even friendship with a man after a devastating experience with a former mentor. Interspersed in the action is the introduction of several intriguing secondary characters, including a pregnant 20-year-old beekeeper.Onto the scene drives Cormac O'Neill, a writer intent on writing Isabel's grandfather's story. What he learns about the old man also informs him about his two granddaughters. He senses that Isabel needs to free herself and he goes about breaking down the barriers that enable her to finally do just that, as illustrated by shocking action that she takes when her cooking school is threatened by those secrets she continues to cling to. This second in what I hope is a series of Bella Vista Chronicles promises to live on in other stories hinted at in the last twenty pages of this wonderful story. I hated to see it end."}, {"userName": "Jo-Anne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9792550-jo-anne", "userReview": "Isabel was raised by her grandparents at beautiful Bella Vista. Her dream was to become a chef which lead her to turn her home into a destination cooking school. Bella Vista is the perfect spot for this with it's huge old house, orchards and bee hives.Isabel now lives with only her grandfather, Magnus, who wanted to have his life story told and published. Isabel's half sister, Tess, arranged for this to happen by hiring writer, Cormac \"Mac\" O'Neil. When Mac arrives, Isabel doesn't know who he is and this leads to a pretty funny event. Turns out that Mac is a pretty famous writer who travels all over the world for his stories.Isabel is a very busy woman whose first priority is helping her family. Isabel had a bad experience with her first love so she has shut herself off from feeling anything for a man again. She fights her feeling for Mac but loses the battle.Wiggs must have done an enormous amount of research on the horrific times the Jewish people endured in the early 1940s in order to write so convincingly about Magnus' life.I thought this story was more about Magus' life, most of which was working in the underground movement in Denmark helping to prevent the Germans from murdering all the Jews in WWII than about Isabel and her dream school or romance.If you are interested in reading about the experiences of people during the holocaust you will like this book. If you aren't interested in that time then this book is not for you.I won this book in a Goodreads First Reads giveaway."}], "description": "#1 New York Times bestselling author Susan Wiggs returns to sun-drenched Bella Vista, where the land's bounty yields a rich harvest\u2026and family secrets that have long been buried.

But Isabel's carefully ordered plans begin to go awry when swaggering, war-torn journalist Cormac O'Neill arrives to dig up old history.
