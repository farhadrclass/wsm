The former are baudier but ultimately probably more conventionally moral than their masters - not sure if Green even cares about that, since cadences of speech and diction seem to be his predominant interests. The whole thing is in a slightly brittle tone highly reminiscent of Ivy Compton-Burnett, though ultimately less cynical.\"Living\" is one of his earliest, from 1929; it is set entirely among Birmingham steel-workers and the economic and political angle to the story would be hard to ignore, but again linguistic audacity is paramount. The tendency of Northern dialects to make sparing use of definite and indefinite articles is observable in naturalist writers from D.H. Lawrence to Stan Barstow, but Green takes it to an extreme, rendering every utterance a telegraphic series of nouns, verbs and adjectives, piled up like blocks with a minimum of connective tissue. As the longest of the three in this collection, that makes it a bit tough going at times.Finally, \"Party Going\" has quite a classical unity and an economy of means that would make it an effective play. A dozen upper-class characters are trapped for an evening in a railway hotel by a dense fog which is preventing their scheduled departure. Forced into close quarters, people's social anxieties, insecurity and manipulativeness are magnified. The depiction of them is satirical but not mercilessly so - the characters retain an amusingly sympathetic quality."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/698826-alan", "userReview": "Three great novels. Poetic, mysterious, true. Not for everyone though as the style (different in each one) can be difficult. This piece of description from 'Loving' has stayed with me for many years:(The saddleroom)was a place from which light was almost excluded now by cobwebs across its two windows and into which, with the door ajar, the shafted sun lay in a lengthened arch of blazing sovereigns. Over a corn bin on which he had packed last autumn's ferns lay Paddy snoring between these windows, a web strung from one lock of hair back onto the sill above and which rose and fell as he breathed. Caught in the reflection of spring sunlight this cobweb looked to be made of gold as did those others which by working long minutes spiders had drawn from spar to spar of the fern bedding on which his head rested. It might have been almost that O'Conor's [Paddy:] dreams were held by hairs of gold binding his head beneath a vaulted roof on which the floor of cobbles reflected an old king's molten treasure from the bog.OK quite conventional, but how about this from 'Living' -Mr Craigan smoked pipe, already room was blurred by smoke from it and by steam from hot water in the sink. She swilled water over the plates and electric light caught in shining waves of water which rushed off plates as she held them, and then light caught on wet plates in moons. She dried these. One by one then she put them up into the rack on wall above her, and as she stretched up so her movements pulled all ways at his heart, so beautiful she seemed to him. If you don't like the latter you won't like Henry Green."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1627591-robert", "userReview": "Living, Henry Green's first novel, published in 1929 when he was twenty-four, is wisely and wonderfully written in a minor key about minor characters who demand major attention through their flawed, stumbling, enduring humanity.The setting is Birmingham, England, where men work at a foundry that is foundering. The owner is about to die, but not yet, and the son is about to take over, but not yet. Meanwhile the workers sing and chatter to one another, gossip and comment,and have womenfolk and children at home with just enough cash on hand to make it through the week.Lily Gates is the moral center of the tale. She's in her early twenties and must stay at home and take care of it for her father, Joe Gates, and her grandfather, Mr Craigan (as he is called). She'd love to have a job, love to live the kind of life she sees in the movies, love to be able to decide who is the better bet for marriage, Mr Dale or Mr Jones, both foundry workers. This ensemble reminds me of Colm Toiban's Brooklyn but the delicacy and ingenuity of the prose, its spontaneity, reminds me more of the flight of pigeons, an airborne motif throughout the novel.Living is half overheard, a quarter lyrical exposition, another quarter striking, quick-paced encounter. At the same time it is curiously phrased not only in Birmingham dialect but also in a kind of notational style wherein articles and prepositions are deliberately omitted creating stumps of sentences that are pleasant to trip over. Some passages read like Dubliners, others like Ulysses, and then others like the sweeping montages of John Dos Pasos's U.S.A. trilogy, capturing public houses, the fizzing, foaming fury of molten metal, football match jousting, and the unexpected intrusions of the foundry owner's son's romantic disappointments. If he were not necessary to the unfolding of the plot, he would be more than expendable.For reasons that are not always clear, Green divides this text into chapters. The chapters themselves dart everywhere with no transitional language to remind us that something that once was happening is happening again and is further along toward the police station, the sickbed, or a desperately unhappy elopement that cannot be other other than it comes to be. Mr Jones wants to do right by Lily; he simply can't; he doesn't have the money, the professional skills, the knowledge of the world, or the support of his parents (now lost somewhere in the maw of Liverpool, where he cannot find them.In many ways Green illustrates the rule that there are no rules for writing fiction--only that whatever you are doing, you have to know how to do it, which he does."}, {"userName": "Tisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/677489-tisa", "userReview": "I really loved Concluding,and I'm enjoying the first novel in this collected three, Loving, even more, for its \"life below stairs\" perspective. Green is a master of a kind of narrative strategy that excises all the fluff and chatter and lets the dialogue do the work, like a play, without sacrificing a sense of interior for the characters, in that uncanny way with speech and gesture that playwrights have. His narrators cannot enter into the body, but what is said by our guide, in conjunction with the speaking cast, more than suffices. What I love best is Green's shifts in perspective, the eye-as-camera: we go wherever a character may look, from time to time, very fluidly without a cut, stage direction or narrative announcement. For example (I'm paraphrasing a scene here),\"Look, now, Kate, there's Mrs. Tennant out with her Violet for their morning walk,\" Edith's face pressed against the cold class.\"My, these peacocks do follow one so. But they are beautiful.\"\"Yes, it's true. Now, Buzz, come here!.\" Violet bellows at the dog as Mrs. Tennant turns her distaste for loud voices towards the sky, inspecting the clouds.I totally understand why Brian Evenson had us read Chekov's short story, \"Ward No. 6\" and some selections from Colette's shots, with Henry Green's Concluding, in our fiction workshop at Brown. In terms of narrative strategies and innovation, they are kindred spirits.I especially admire the mileage Green gets out of his titles, ironically engaging and juxtaposing them with the content of each book.Curious: Henry Green was born into a wealthy family, but his ear for dialogue, eye for domestic/class drama, and perhaps sense of injustice (or mere fascination) during WWII immersed him in working class speech and concerns. I'll be reading his autobiography next, Pack My Bag."}, {"userName": "Trena", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1253638-trena", "userReview": "This book is allegedly one of the top 100 books of the century. It is hideously terrible and completely unreadable. It is basically a transcript of complete mundanities. I can see how, perhaps, it was innovative when it was written (but surely he wasn't the first to write about the \"downstairs\" of a great house), but it is ungodly awful. In my opinion, this is an Emperor's New Clothes kind of book. It can't possibly be as stupid and pointless as it seems, smart people say it's awesome, and so everybody says it must be brilliant literature. I am totally willing to say that the Emperor has no effing clothes here."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/176260-lauren", "userReview": "Well, just Loving but I liked it lot and plan to read the other two, just not right away.

The stories can be a little difficult to follow at first: in each, characters are referred to by several names, the narrative jumps around from one situation to another much like a soap opera, and important plot points and aspects of character development are (artfully) revealed through dialogue. These stories are not mysteries (though Loving has what could be called a mystery element), but reading them is a little like solving a puzzle. At first, you have to get your bearings. You are presented with many different pieces, and it takes a little while to figure out what you\u2019re looking at. The further you progress, the clearer the picture becomes and the more quickly it goes. By the end, you have something that seems much more than the sum of its parts. I guess this is true of most books to some extent, but I found it especially true here.My individual ratings for each of these novels are based partly on the author\u2019s craft\u2014which is admirable, partly on how enjoyable they were to read, and partly on how rewarding they were. I don\u2019t mind doing a little bit of work when I\u2019m reading if there\u2019s a great payoff. Loving rates highest on all three of these criteria. As I got further into Loving, I found myself thinking that it\u2019s begging to be made into a film, and wondering if perhaps maybe it HAS been (as far as I can tell, it has not). The best ad I can give for any and all of these novels comes from Green himself. Of his inspiration for Loving, he told The Paris Review: \"I got the idea of Loving from a manservant in the Fire Service during the war. He was serving with me in the ranks, and he told me he had once asked the elderly butler who was over him what the old boy most liked in the world. The reply was: 'Lying in bed on a summer morning, with the window open, listening to the church bells, eating buttered toast with cunty fingers.' I saw the book in a flash.\""}, {"userName": "Korri", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30119-korri", "userReview": "Read Loving on the bus to Manhattan and on Roosevelt Island Thursday 23 August 2012. Green does a wonderful job of letting the characters speak for themselves with minimal third-person omniscent narration. It reminds me of a stageplay in that the dialogue reveals so much about the characters and their secrets, longings, and motivations. It makes the tale more life-like & vivid.Party Going has been my handbag book since August. Like Loving it focused on class and status through the lens of love. Unlike Loving, where the dialogue could be lifted directly onto screen or stage, Party Going relies heavily upon narration to describe the subtle shifts in moods or the dynamics between characters. Through the narration, readers are privy to the character's thoughts and see the characters behind the scenes before they perform for others. Example: Miss Julia Wray's nervous flighty energy, walk through the fog, and concern about her charms made her seem childish and a bit unstable. In the group, however, we came to learn that she is part of the smart set, is one of Max's love interests, and is quite capable of manipulating situations. Green plays with reader's expectations, showing us different, deeply personal sides of his characters. Repeatedly one or another character thinks, 'you can't tell what people are thinking under the exterior'; so many people misread others and misconstrue their intentions. Love--provoking, spurning, kindling, mulling over, manipulating love--is something the characters play with.I haven't even begun to formulate my thoughts about the unusual grammatical constructions, imagery of birds (pigeons, seagulls), the role of Miss Fellowes & her illness, the masses outside in the fog (Thompson's kiss with a passing girl vs Edwards's fastidiousness) versus the upper classes holed up in the hotel (with their romantic notions of English working classes and simultaneous fear of 'them' overrunning the hotel).It was very Woolf-ian in a way: To the Lighthouse, to the train, never going, but it remains suspended as a future possibility on which all hopes are pinned."}, {"userName": "Federico", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25672838-federico", "userReview": "Only read \"Loving\".A very boring and hard read for me. Why on earth this house has so many servants? what do they do all day long? why does the author let them talk incessantly in their annoying jargon? Dear author, please interrupt them, please do something to convince me I should care. Because I really don't care about all those names: yes names, just names, as they don't come alive as real characters to me.We are promised that the arrival of the kids will bring some change, but seriously, I don't see anything. Okay, they have to do with the ring and all those doves (which remind me of Umberto Eco I just read), but come on. Oh, and a real obsession about peacocks *this* author has.Around 50 pages and few bad days into the reading, I really got sick of this book, so I entered accelerated reading mode and in one evening I got over it. I can tell you that around p. 150 it gets better, probably because the author gets sick of it too at last and hurries up to close it. One character also became alive for me at that point, [Raunce's] Albert.Anyway, you can try this book. You can find something in it if you like this kind of English. If not, don't abandon it but don't let it annoy you too much, read one word out of ten until you find a passage you appreciate and get rid of it in an evening."}, {"userName": "Alyssa", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5368520-alyssa", "userReview": "As this edition is 3 novels in one book it is hard for me to review all of it despite having read the whole thing. Henry Green's writing is difficult and slow going, but his characters are fascinating, if confusing. This probably explains why his novels have recently come into the favor of literary critics. This collection of 3 novels gave a very interesting view of the early to mid 20th century and allowed for exploration of the different social classes during this time. While I enjoyed reading the novels and found myself laughing aloud at points, they're much too tedious for a pleasure read. I think I would have gotten much more out of the novels in a classroom or academic setting."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1463506-kristin", "userReview": "Loving by Henry Green is about the goings-on between the servants and masters in a castle in Ireland during WWII. It's a pretty simple tale, but there isn't much plot. There's a sort of love triangle between the butler, Charlie, his \"man\" (aka assistant) Albert, and a chamber maid, Edith, a missing ring, fear of the I.R.A., a drunken cook, an affair between the master's (Mrs. Tennant) daughter-in-law and Capt. Davenport while Mr. Jack (Mrs. Tennant's son) is off doing the army thing... it's more scenes and vignettes of what's happening as opposed to any traditional plot with a climax, denouement, etc.There were some interesting things in Loving that I don't think I've come across yet in any other novels: firstly, there are two characters named Albert - there is Charlie's man Albert, and then the drunken cook's nephew Albert comes to stay to get away from the London bombings. Secondly, there is a character, Paddy, who nobody can understand except the other chamber maid, Kate. So all the servants will be sitting at dinner, and Paddy will say something. But you only know he said something because Charlie will ask, \"What did he say?\" and then Kate translates. Also, some of the transition from one \"scene\" to the next is done almost like in a movie. There isn't any real break in the action (I don't mean literally, action - there isn't any of that); instead, it goes something like this: there is a scene of the servants doing their thing in the castle, and in order to transition to Mrs. Tennant and daughter-in-law walking the grounds, Green will say (paraphrasing here): \"While this was going on, Mrs. Tennant...\" as if the scene in the castle fades out and we see them walking around. Sometimes this caught me off guard (I wasn't paying attention), and I would think - now where did Mrs. Tennant come from? Why does it now seem like they're out in the yard? So I would have to go back, and then I would realize that Green had subtly transitioned from one conversation to another.Charlie is an odd character, and you can't really tell what his motives are... in the beginning, the original butler (Eldon) is dying, and Charlie really couldn't care less (well, neither can any of the other servants, but that's beside the point). Charlie is too busy trying to take over for Eldon. He seems kind of sleazy and none of the other servants like or trust him (except Edith). So, when he first starts making passes at her, you can't really tell if he's serious. Even in the end, you can't really tell...he says things that make you think he doesn't really care about Edith, but maybe he's just playing a game to get her to like him back...or maybe he's just a player (or is that spelled playa?). Edith is equally ambiguous. She seems all right most of the time, but then she wants to keep Mrs. Tennant's ring, (which she finds, then it goes missing again). It seemed out of character. I guess most - ok all - of the characters are pretty ambiguous in that way.An interesting synchronicity is going on with my reading right now...I am currently in the Valley of Bones part of Dance to the Music of Time, in which Nick Jenkins, enrolled in the Army, is sent with his company to Northern Ireland (this is during WWII also). All of the characters in Loving are British nationals (or almost all of the characters - I couldn't figure out if Paddy was Irish) , and there is a big to-do about the IRA, fear of the IRA, fear of the Germans invading, fear for loved ones who may be being bombed, etc. Are they better to stay in Ireland, with all the Irish thugs out to get them and the threat of the Germans invading, or should they go back to England, abandoning the castle? In Dance, as I just mentioned, we're also in Ireland, but from a different perspective...but there's still the fear there. Someone gets attacked while walking to the barracks during a military exercise and has his guns stolen, and it is suggested that it was Irish nationals. It's interesting to see this side of things...I haven't run into stories about the British in Ireland during the war before.It turns out that Henry Green was a comtemporary, friend, and former classmate of Powell and also Evelyn Waugh. It appears that Green had a colorful life - kind of unexpected, as Loving wasn't every colorful IMO. In conversation, he preferred gossip to serious subjects (not unexpectedly), was known as a ladies man, and eventually became an alcoholic. While at Oxford, he shunned intellectual pursuits in favor of going to the movies twice a day and \"scorned his tutor, the bluff, hearty C.S. Lewis.\" Green also apparently had a cruel streak, and a girlfriend once told him, \"Hurting - that should be the title of your next novel.\" He was popular among his contemporaries and later authors. W.D. Auden called him \"the best English novelist alive\" (though he is no longer, since he is no longer alive); Eudora Welty stated that his work had \"an intenstiy greater than that of any other writer of imaginative fiction today.\" And John Updike: \"Henry Green was a novelist of such rarity, such marvellous originality, intuition, sensuality, and finish, that every fragment of his work is precious.\" Really, John, I don't know about that, but to each his own. My grandma always says it's good we don't all like the same things. Loving is a pretty harmless book - sometimes amusing, short, and easy to get through. Not sure why it made the Modern Library's Top 100, but whatever...oh wait, isn't Updike on the Board? The edition of Loving that I own also contains two other books by Green: Living and Party Going. In the coming years, I will probably read both of them as well. A NY Times reviewer wrote, (of Anthony Powell) \"Like Henry Green, an even better novelist, Anthony Powell was too British to catch on [in the U.S.] at first.\" So, if British comedies are your thing, you'd probably love it. If they annoy the piss out of you, don't bother. I'm somewhere in between. I think the following quote sums up Loving fairly well: \"None of [Green's] books illustrates a philosophy, promotes a theme, or delivers a message. With him it is the richness of the felt, heard, and seen moment, often garnished with low comedy, that is the sole point - if, indeed, there is any point at all.\""}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12402619-michael", "userReview": "The 3 best novels by this criminally neglected writer, all in one handy omnibus.

I enjoyed the novel but at the same time I got the feeling I was being had or duped. The abrupt, fairy-tale ending only added to that feeling. At the same time, though, I couldn\u2019t help laughing at the absurdity in the story, which would make the ending a perfect fit. I\u2019ll mention the links post on Henry Green and Loving since it contains several good descriptions of Green\u2019s style and notes on the novel. Green\u2019s comment about the novel captures some of the satiric flavor:\u201cThe British servants in Eire while England is at war is Raunce's conflict, and one meant to be satirically funny. It is a crack at the absurd southern Irish and at the same time a swipe at the British servants, who yet remain human beings. But it is meant to torpedo that woman and her daughter-in-law, the employers.\u201dMrs. Tennant, \"that woman\" and the owner of the Irish castle, and her daughter-in-law Violet are \u201ctorpedoed\u201d often in the novel through their own actions and comments. Mrs. Tennant\u2019s self-absorption is on full display in when she talks about the difficulty keeping up the castle in neutral Ireland during World War II:\u201cBut in a way I regard this as my war work, maintaining the place I mean. Because we\u2019re practically in enemy country here you know and I do consider it so important from the morale point of view to keep up appearances. This country has been ruined by people who did not live on their estates. It might be different if [\u00c9amon] de Valera had a use for places of the kind. Why he doesn\u2019t offer Ireland as a hospital base I can\u2019t imagine. Then one could hand over a house like this with an easy conscience.\u201dGreen still allows Mrs. Tennant to \u201cremain a human being\u201d as she deals with her isolation, not just in widowhood but in the distance she (accurately) perceives in her many relationships. There is plenty of ambiguity in Loving, where Green\u2019s style mirrors his message\u2014despite revealing a lot about his characters we never really get to know them. The hired help of the castle provide the life and vitality of the novel. Whether they are concerned about family members in London during the bombing or filching peacock eggs for beauty treatments, their worries run the gamut from real to absurd. It turns out many of them have perfected a racket to squeeze extra money out of the household or get ahead in some manner. The resentment and devotion that the help exhibits, often at the same time, toward Mrs. Tennant and her family encapsulates their struggle with their own stations in life. Mrs. Tennant longs for order but the recurring scandals, big and small, demonstrate that such a desire will never come to fruition. Charley Raunce, the head footman who assumes a rise in stature after the death of the butler, provides a sort of stability for the other help yet he undermines it often enough with his enmity toward the head housemaid, his nervousness around his love Edith, and his failing health. My favorite character, Paddy, is not given a direct quote since his thick Irish brogue has to be deciphered and translated. Absurdities such as this continue to pile up as the story progresses (if progressing proves to be the appropriate term). John Updike\u2019s introduction captures several of the reasons I enjoyed Loving:\u201cW. H. Auden once called him the finest living English novelist. But no need exists to set up a competition; his writing generation has passed on, and his novels are sufficiently unlike any others, sufficiently assured in their perilous, luminous fullness, to warrant the epithet incomparable. And they have become, with time, photographs of a vanished England. Their substantive content, in human psychology, in social mores, in what can be seen and heard by a man alive in a place and time, is as rich as their formal design in intricate, rounded, and pleasing. \u2026 Green\u2019s human qualities\u2014his love of work and laughter; his absolute empathy; his sense of spendour amid loss, of vitality within weakness\u2014make him a precious witness to any age. \u2026 With upper-class obliquity he champions the demotic in language and in everything. \u2026 They [his novels] live, in short, and like all living feed on air, the invisible; the spaces between the words are warm, and the strangeness is mysteriously exact, the strangeness of the vital.\u201dThe warmth and vitality may seem slight at times but they are there. At the same time, I understand many of the criticisms of, or more often the disappointment in reading, Loving. Only near the end of the novel did I feel things click in place for my enjoyment, a moment where I laughed out loud at the ridiculous world Green created. I don\u2019t think my wife will let me live that one down any time soon."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17429758-richard", "userReview": "This refers only to LOVING. I have wanted to read Henry Green for a long time but have only had an autobiography until just recently when I bought this volume.I thoroughly enjoyed this somewhat spicy and very good-humored view of the \"downstairs\" segment of UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS and DOWNTON ABBEY without the pretensions. This story is set in a Big House in Ireland at the beginning of WWII; there is reference to the fine appointments of the house, including an indoor \"dairy\" that might remind one of Marie Antoinette's folly. Along the same line is the family name, Tennant, and the presence of peacocks. And there is a constant worrisome threat, beginning with the death of the butler, Mr. Eldon, the threat of the IRA who burn down such places, neutrality and the possible invasion of the \"Jerries,\" illness, upstairs infidelity, and so on.The new butler who move up at once, on his own, Mr Raunce, is not thought highly of by any of the senior women, Miss Burch (house), Miss Swift (nanny), and Miss Welch (kitchen). Edie, Raunce's \"girl,\" and Kate are housemaids, Edie fills in for Miss Swift with the children, Moira and Evelyn; Jane and Mary are scullery maids. \"Paddy,\" a native Irishman and Kate's interest, is the handyman who speaks Gaelic (Kate translates) and cares for the couple of hundred peacocks on the property. Albert works for Mr Raunce, loves Edie, leaves to enlist as an airplane gunner in his disappointment.Mrs. Tennant is somewhat careless, leaving about the occasional glove or the valuable piece of jewelry, a cluster ring, central to the disaffection of Raunce and the younger staff when queried by an insurance investigator, Michael Mathewson, upsetting everyone. While nothing is said directly, Albert claims to have had the ring to get Edie off the hook; the children, of course, are privy to everything and know he had buried the ring in a peacock shell, perhaps to use it for a \"nest egg,\" something Edie herself had suggested to Raunce. Victoria T, Mrs T's daughter-in-law, is having an affair with Capt Davenport while her husband is in England.One might see a pattern in the children knowing what's going on with the servants and the staff with the family. Much is left unsaid but appears in Green's laconic and precise style depicting tone, expression, stance; Victoria's discomfort around Mrs T.The various threats, real and imagined, seem to come together toward the end when Raunce, obviously physically ill, has to tell Edie that their plan to occupy a house on the property and have his mother come over from [bombed] England is scuttled by his mother's stubbornness and refusal to run away; they have to plan to simply abandon their places and head to England, violating all the proprieties of giving notice, etc. But that they do and \"live happily ever after,\" as the book ends, not really satisfyingly. Though the reader may be misled in exactly the same fashion that many of the characters are, caught up in the possibilities, a trap cleverly laid."}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3832765-lee", "userReview": "Oh I do hate to do this. Henry Green is hailed by what seems like his entire generation of writers and many more since, was best pals with Diana Mitford (my problematic fav), and gave this fantastically enigmatic interview with the Paris Review in 1958, discussing his 'crabwise approach' to storytelling and how his dialogue style emulates the way 'people strike sparks off each other'. I tracked this book down in my local second-hand shop, scuttled home with it, and settled down ready to love it. And that was back in May. Since then it's been seven hard months of chip-chip-chipping away. Loving was ok. Living was not. And by the time I was half way through Party Going -- which actually was the story I was most looking forward to, being a kind of Seinfeld Chinese Restaurant episode as reimagined by the Bright Young People -- I was counting down the pages and scratching tally marks into my bedroom wall :(I just couldn't keep track of the characters in Party Going -- I just kept thinking what a better film it would make. I absolutely loved the bird motif throughout the three novels -- the peacocks of Loving were particularly vivid. I appreciated Green's graceful mastery of the narrative, how the story slid from scene to scene: one character moves toward a window, sees her guests in the garden, and now we're there with them at the end of the lawn. It's certainly a very memorable book, and I am glad to have read it, but I can't convey the relief I felt upon finally finishing the bloody thing. Genuinely hope I'll acquire a taste for Green as I get older and become a better reader, but it'll definitely be a while before I give him another bash."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2092969-miriam", "userReview": "Like a season of Downton Abbey in which the major plot lines are a lost and found ring, an extramarital affair, the fate of some peacocks, a visiting may or may not be bastard child, and a war on (WWII). Same close quarters, gossip, and conniving, but with less humor and no likable characters. It's practically all dialogue, which is not a criticism, just the truth. There's very little character development and little scenery. And the way people talk to each other obfuscates as much as it reveals. I guess that could be the point, that we only know people by what they say and they actually say very little that's true or unchanging, but it's really hard for getting me to get invested in a bunch of people. Oh, and I skipped Living and Party Going, because they were not on the list. I let myself skip them. That should say a lot to anyone who knows how hard it is for me not to finish a book I start. They are separate novels, the library only had this combined copy (thank God I didn't spend money on this), and I'm allowed to quit.Strange use of punctuation--commas sometimes used to offset appositives, sometimes not. A hard rhythm for me to catch. When I saw that John Updike had written the intro, saying that Green taught him how to write, I tried to pay attention to the writing specifically to see what kind of greatness I could find. I didn't like Updike; I don't like this guy. The writing is fine, but not impressive.This Modern Library 100 Books of the Twentieth Century has been a lot of \"British people on estates in the first half of the century.\" Surely there are more topics to explore. But I think I've got a good sense of a genre I never would have cared about (or even really suspected existed) before.

The other two titles are not on any of my blasted lists but if I can get through my next two bookclub books before this is due, I'll happily read Living and Party-Going as well. It requires a lot of attention. It's told mostly in dialogue, and has dialogue tags, but if you don't pay attention to who said what how and to whom, all the time, you miss the tension and undercurrents. I went back and reread and rechecked a few times. Also, the servants refer to both their employers and Hitler without names but with only pronouns or referents. When they worry that he'll invade, and use Ireland (where the book is set) as a stepping stone and staging ground to England, okay, it's evident they're talking about Hitler. Like the movie \"Gosford Park,\" it has two points of view, from above and below stairs. (My mental pictures of Edith and Kate, the housemaids, were strongly colored by Emily Watson and whoever played Mary Maceachran--Kelly Macdonald, since I had to look up how to spell the character's name anyway.) Again like an Altman movie, the perspective changes fluidly. There's a scene with the two maids in their attic bedroom, looking out the window, and the perspective slips down to follow the characters they're gossiping about.The plot, of servants' internecine squabbling and parrying with their employers, and the family's own troubles and fears of the servants dying or leaving to join up, plus everyone's fear of the Irish, the IRA, and Germany, was little more than a trellis to support the burgeoning, twisting ivy of masterful narrative technique.

I wasn't drawn into the book. As a lot of Goodreads reviewers said, I was put off by the lack of punctuation and confused over the name changes (All those Arthurs!) It wasn't exactly hard to follow, but the reading of it was, to me, monotonous. No chapter breaks or changes, no real sense of where you're going, and just dialogue.Green reminds me of Sterne and Thomas Love Peacock, since Peacock did dialogue novels, and I admit Green has good dialogue, with an authentic rendering of common speech. Raunce and Edith are likable, and I enjoyed the struggle Raunce has to assert his authority. Also, the setting of these English servants in Ireland doing their bit while war rages at home is good, and the sense of them caught adrift in this antiquated house and social system while WWII is next door is a good theme. Especially since a lot of them want to go home, but don't\u2026and keep going over it and over it as if they were waiting for Godot. The comparison of doves and peacocks is also good. But the story doesn't go anywhere, and that kept me from continuing past page 110. I know some Goodreads reviewers slogged through, but I don't have the patience. I can't in any sense see why this is 'one of the one hundred greatest books of the twentieth century.' I'll stick with Waugh or Graham Greene. They seem to be writing about something, and they have ACTION. Besides, I've written two novels, and at least I have punctuation. It reminded me of an old argument a friend of mine had over reading, when she pondered reading books we ought to read rather than like to read.

Party-Going is a tremendous short novel, written in \"real-time,\" it seems, the events of the novel unfolding during the two or three hours of a massive train delay caused by London fog. (The time is the 1930s.) I say \"real time\" because it seems that you could read the book in exactly as much time as elapses in the course of the story. A group of rich young socialites on their way to Paris wait listlessly in a hotel, gossiping, sipping drinks, engaging in half-hearted emotional terrorism, while their porters wait below in the mobbed train-station. The elderly aunt of one of the young socialites has fallen mysteriously ill, and her suffering and delirium are woven through the text, which works by sudden shifts of scene with few breaks and even fewer narratorial interventions. Most of the text is reported speech, it reads almost like a play, but the \"dialogue\" is too subtle, too hypnotically terse, and too much about nothing to be a proper drama. The not-so-subtle symbolism of a mob of working class passengers trapped in the foggy passages of the station while the rich people recline and drink in a comfortable room severals floors up becomes a source of insistent tension. The fog also is quite palpable as annoyance, as anxiety, as uncertainty in the midst of these people's charming little travel plans. The style is sparse, the action even more so, but one feels a deliberate, if unspoken, sense of disgust, and sometimes of sympathy, underlying the cool, polished surface of the language. I look forward to reading the other novels in the volume!"}, {"userName": "Thomas Armstrong", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/307421-thomas-armstrong", "userReview": "I got this book only to read Loving, which I wanted to read because it was on the Modern Library's list of the 100 best novels of the twentieth century (I'm a sucker for book lists!) I had a hard time getting into it initially because I kept wondering where the plot was going. Then after maybe sixty pages I went back and read John Updike's introduction and learned that the narrative wasn't supposed to be going anywhere. I found out that the book was actually about life's moments reflected against the light and shadow of human nature in all of its gradations. So I returned to the book with this in mind, and I thoroughly enjoyed it from that moment on! It's really a book of wonderful dialogue and conversations; as good as I've seen in any literature. The book might have been called ''Hating'' since there's an abundance of that in the book. But there is also plenty of loving in the book; quite enough to justify the title. The loving occurs at all levels: between doves, little kids (the girl's love for little Albert), servants, and between masters (as in the adultery of Mrs. Jack's with her paramour Dermot). The conversations are really funny, precious, profound, trivial, impassioned, snotty, catty. The only bone I have to pick with the author is the abrupt ending. It was so out of character with the rest of the novel, that I can only assume that the author was more or less laughing at the reader and saying ''so you want a great ending, do you? well, it's not about the plot, stupid, it's about each moment, the preciousness of being aware at each moment in our lives together.''"}, {"userName": "SarahC", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/211925-sarahc", "userReview": "I have only completed the story \"Loving\" within this collection. These stories actually have more the pace and length of novellas. I was glad to be introduced to Henry Green with his odd, detached, often grim voice. His writing has a unique energy, which often bursts forth during subdued passages of the story. Much of \"Loving\" is told from the perspective of the \"downstairs\" inhabitants of an Anglo-Irish estate during World War II. Green is a writer who does not lamely explain things to the reader; he expects you to make yourself at home pretty much immediately -- which I always respect in a writer. This really gives more depth to fiction; no stories in life have clear beginnings or clear turning points so I enjoy finding my way around with writers like Green.Green wrote in early to mid 20th century, a period of literature which I have been reading for quite some time. He is another neglected author like so many fine ones who provide such a portrait of that era.

He has some things in common with Ronald Firbank, Ivy Compton-Burnett and Evelyn Waugh, but he is a very distinctive and original writer. His novels are written primarily in dialogue, and he is wonderful at writing in diferrent voices and dialects. He also writes about working class life with empathy and understanding, which makes him anomalous among Modernist writers and English novelists of the period. It is difficult to tell who his literary influences were and I can't think of any writer who seems obviously influenced by him, so he seems to stand outside of literary history and that goes some way to explaining why he is so neglected. Of the three novels contained in this volume I liked Living the best. It is a powerful and moving novel of life and work centred around a Birmingham factory, and I don't understand why it isn't more famous and celebrated."}, {"userName": "L.P.

However, once you fall into the rhythm of Green's lyrical dialogue it is no more difficult to read than a play and when he breaks from dialogue to describe a rare piece of location the images - for example, the conversations shouted over the sound of the relentlessly crashing surf in Loving - live on long after you have finished the book."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71127-alison", "userReview": "What unobtrusively wonderful novels!
