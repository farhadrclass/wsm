I LOVE this genre. Based on that AND the fact that a First Edition of Lonesome Dove still holds a rose from my prom, yes...it's safe to say I know and enjoy a great Western. However, placing personal feelings aside, Where They Bury You offers an adventure to us as readers. It will take you to a place in the past where survival was the story. If you could get a little love and security along the way, even better. The research of this novel--the details, the experiences, the story as told by Kohlhagen, of the shifting social changes of the era--offer a new depth in understanding the struggles of the time. Mr. Kohlhagen's research has absolutely taken me by surprise. A very pleasant surprise.I highly recommend this book to you."}, {"userName": "Richard Epstein", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15384354-richard-epstein", "userReview": "Not at all a bad novel, but I am about to abandon it anyway, deterred by pretty much the worst proofreading I've ever encountered from a commercial press.

That\u2019s what led Steven W. Kohlhagen to write Where They Bury You. What he read in Kit Carson\u2019s report about August 1863\u2019s events didn\u2019t make sense to him, so he began to do some research. The question he kept asking himself was \u201cDid the Navajo really shoot Santa Fe\u2019s Provost Marshall, Joseph Cummings?\u201d The result is a mystery novel based on historic facts and a very real murder, all set amid the turbulence that made up the very wild but very real West during the Civil War.

I lived in South Dakota during the filming of more than one cowboys-and-Indians movie (including Dances with Wolves), which provoked conversations about how we view that time and talk about the people, decisions, and events that unfolded. As a result, when I read book set during this era, I want a more nuanced look at the circumstances and people.Happily, I got that, and more, in this book. I was intrigued by this novel for the historical mystery offered: in 1863, the US Marshal in Santa Fe was killed during a skirmish with the Navajo, with what would be almost a million dollars today on his person. While Kit Carson and the official record says nothing else about this incident or the money, Kohlhagen was curious about the 'real' story. I anticipated a historical thriller with more conspiracy elements, a la Timothy O'Brien's The Lincoln Conspiracy, but this is actually a rather robust and detailed historical novel of Civil War-era New Mexico and Arizona, and the tenuous, complicated relationship between the white Americans, the various Native American tribes, and the Mexicans in the area.I don't think I can succinctly summarize the plot, which seems rather complicated, but in Kohlhagen's hands, unfolds neatly. Covering about two years (1861 through 1863), the novel opens with a oh-god-please-don't-be-so-dumb incident (which is historical) that sets off the violent and tragic turn of events. In Arizona, a green Army officer starts a war with the Apache when he accuses their chief, Cochise, of kidnapping a rancher's child and holds Cochise's family as hostage. While that trouble boils down south, in Santa Fe, a group of gamblers fleeing their pasts (either in California or out East), come together and form a plot to get rich. The tensions in the US over the Lincoln presidency, the succession of states in the south, and the question of slavery touch New Mexico and Arizona as well.Kohlhagen's writing was very approachable, which I appreciated, since I tend to get glazed eye over army and/or battle scenes, and he balances the big conflict (wars) with the smaller one (the con). I found I 'knew' the characters, which was quite a feat given the cast! (It didn't hurt that Kohlhagen includes a list of who's who at the start and separates the two -- thankfully -- so I didn't spend hours googling Lily Smoot, his fictional gambler mastermind.) Kohlhagen manages to avoid the info dump, although now and then there's a rare narrative hiccup that sticks out (when he introduces Kit Carson to the story, for example, he mentions Carson is 'the most famous of the early 19th Century explorers, trappers, scouts, adventurers, and Indian fighters', which is probably true, but feels odd as it doesn't fit the style Kohlhagen used up to that point.). Otherwise, I liked the writing, which was short, immediate, and punchy.A very quick read (it has about 312 pages), this book surprised me in the best way. Great historical details and a breakneck plot, it's a great read. For those who might not be immediately drawn to this era, consider this book as an intro -- lots of drama, mood, ambiance, and a tough female heroine to keep one hooked."}, {"userName": "Roxanne Kade", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5948499-roxanne-kade", "userReview": "I have always loved Westerns, and I used to love watching North and South when I was little, so this book was a really exciting read for me. The history of this era has always fascinated me. Kohlhagen's mix of fact and fiction made the story come alive, making me feel like I was right alongside these amazing historical figures who shaped the future on the United States. My knowledge of the Civil War is not vast, and war is always ugly, but my gosh, the thousands of lives lost within a two year span was just devastating. It seemed like everyone in that time was out to kill someone, and what made it worse was that a lot of the people involved knew each other personally at one time or another, yet they acted like strangers in the face of war.  There were many amazing characters within the pages of this story, and they each had their own battle, or two, to fight, but I never once felt overwhelmed or lost with everything that was going on. I have to say that out of all the characters, Lily was my favorite. She was feisty and knew how to hustle just about everyone around her. She played a great game with those she was in cahoots with, but I also had to admire her loyalty to Damours. She didn't necessarily give a damn about being loyal in a physical sense, but her heart was in the right place, and she was always looking out for him, even when she could have easily kicked him to the curb. Cummings, for me, was the most loathsome character. He gave me a bad vibe off the bat and my dislike for him grew right to the end of the story. He was spineless, deceitful and a little creepy. This book is an action-packed, murder mystery adventure, and at times a little chaotic (and I mean that in a good way).  Kohlhagen has masterfully captured history, adding his own twist on factual events, and readers will be totally enthralled."}, {"userName": "Aaron", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7822818-aaron", "userReview": "Soon after I began \"Where They Bury You\" I realized that this piece of historical fiction was no masterpiece, but I continued to enjoy it through the conclusion. The characters are interesting if underdeveloped, and the story is all over the place but is going places you want to go anyway and doesn't spend too much time in any one place long enough to get boring. This has that feel of a first novel, although the author has good instincts. That instinct is borne out in his selection of setting, the historical killing of a US Marshal carrying a suspicious amount of cash during the clash of warring Indian tribes of the Southwest during the Civil War. Into this setting he drops his characters, motivations, & plot to try to compete with a truth that rivals most fictions. I'll probably be hunting down more non-fiction works on this period now."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4301021-laurie", "userReview": "This book grabbed me early on and kept me interested throughout. This is an epic story of New Mexico (and Texas) around the time of the Civil War. There is so much going on with groups of people interacting and fighting; all trying to find a way to survive in the harsh, dryness of the beautiful desert. Sometimes, I had trouble keeping all the factions and leaders straight in my head. The author's knowledge of the period clearly shines through and the story is crafted in such a way that it is never boring or dry.I enjoyed the book immensely and was glad for the opportunity to dive into the sequel so I could find out more about the characters and the events that shaped the country, the tenacious settlers, and the others struggling to hang on to a disappearing way of life and lawlessness.This book was given to me in exchange for my honest review.Reviewed by Laurie-J"}, {"userName": "Nae", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2831513-nae", "userReview": "This is one heck of a good, good book, and I have no doubt it is going to make one heck of a good movie as well. This author successfully paints a graphic, gritty picture of what it was like in the West at the time the Civil War started. It is a true whirlwind of a story! He peopled with larger than life true western characters, Kit Carson, Cochise, Geronimo, honestly pictures the struggle to relocate understandably reluctant Indians onto reservations; tossed in branches of both Union and Confederate armies (while I knew many Southerners relocated to Texas and other western states after the war, I had absolutely no idea these 2 armies actually fought battles in the West) against what had to be one of the most stunning con games ever seen in the West up until that time ... ohhhh it is a juicy, gutsy, rollicking read :)"}, {"userName": "Julie Schoerke", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2533486-julie-schoerke", "userReview": "Ii had ben years since I had read or watched a Western and it all came back to me why I love them!

The murder, and the roughly million of today\u2019s dollars in cash and belongings in his saddlebags, is historically factual. Carson\u2019s actual explanation is implausible.Who did kill Carson\u2019s \u201cbrave and lamented\u201d Major? The answer is revealed in this tale of a group of con artists operating in 1861-1863 in the New Mexico and Arizona Territories. As a matter of historical fact, millions of today\u2019s dollars were embezzled from the Army, the Church, and the New Mexico Territory during this time. In this fictionalized version, the group includes a Santa Fe poker dealer with a checkered past claiming to fall in love with one of her co- conspirators, and the historically accurate duo of the Marshal of Santa Fe and the aide de camp of the Territories\u2019 Commanding General. It is an epic tale of murder and mystery, of staggering thefts, of love and deceit.Both a Western and a Civil War novel, this murder mystery occurs in and among Cochise\u2019s Chiricahua Apache Wars, the Navajo depredations and wars, Indian Agent Kit Carson\u2019s return from retirement, and the Civil War. The story follows the con artists, some historical, some fictional, during their poker games, scams, love affairs, and bank robberies, right into that arroyo deep in Navajo country.", "title": "Where They Bury You", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17720136-where-they-bury-you", "average": 3.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1367511985l/17720136.jpg", "reviews": 16, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7029752.Steven_W_Kohlhagen", "name": "Steven W.
