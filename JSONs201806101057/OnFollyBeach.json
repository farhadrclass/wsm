Her mother convinces her to move to Folly Beach, a South Carolina barrier island, to take over a bookstore. Reluctant at first, Emmy only makes up her mind to go when she finds a sort of love letter written in the margin of an old book that came from that store, Folly\u2019s Finds. The first person she encounters is an irascible old woman, Lulu, who seems downright hostile. When she finds out that a condition of her purchasing the store is keeping Lulu on as a tenant for her business designing and selling bottle trees, Emmy nearly gives up. But the margin notes in the books are a mystery she cannot abandon, and somehow Lulu holds the key to the full story. Going back and forth in time from 2009 to 1943, when Lulu was a nine-year-old girl obsessed with Nancy Drew, the novel slowly reveals the great secret. Or at least that is what White set out to do. I guessed the big secret fairly early on and was impatient for the characters to catch up. The book is full of pat answers to major problems. You are stuck grieving the loss of your husband? Remember that he loved you and you\u2019ll be fine. You don\u2019t want to know the truth about the past? Nonsense, it will do you good to face it. There\u2019s actually a nugget of an interesting story here. White based the 1943 story on a real episode of a German spy ring that did infiltrate America and actual German U-boats that sank American merchant ships. But I grew impatient even with those chapters set in the past, because I didn\u2019t believe in the characters, and didn\u2019t really care about them. I wanted to slap Maggie upside the head more than once. And I would have thrown Cat out of the house, deathbed promise to my mother notwithstanding."}, {"userName": "Diane Chamberlain", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1295401-diane-chamberlain", "userReview": "Totally loved it.

I can't believe so many people think this is a 4-star book. I've lived on Folly Beach...sunned on Folly Beach....and ma'am, this is not a realistic representation of Folly Beach. Anybody interested in a true interpretation of the Low Country needs to read \"The Prince of Tides\" by Pat Conroy. The description of the flavor and life of the Low Country is truly lyrical, and the plot climax an actual surprise. As far as \"On Folly Beach\" went, I never felt that the characters really took life. They were \"on paper\" to me, cardboard-thin, and I could almost see the author typing the words, and working hard, but the characters were never fully fleshed out. Predictable and strained plotlines. SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT: The only exception to the above may have been the accurate portrayal of Emmy's grief over Ben's death. That came through in a real way. Otherwise, there were too many holes in the plot and obvious giveaways in this \"mystery.\" For example: as far as the WWII historical part of the book....who DIDN'T know Peter was a German spy almost from the point that he started asking Maggie questions about life in Charleston, about how they lived, and about what residents suspected about German activity in the area, etc? The leap that Maggie made from meeting Peter to being deeply in love with him was totally fuzzy for me. It seemed that the main attraction between this tepid character and her erstwhile suitor was the fact that he appeared very interested/in love with her, while at the same time covertly sampling the delights of sexual and vapid (yet intriguing) Cat. Also, why did Maggie marry Robert if she was convinced that Peter would return someday at any moment -- to the point that she perished in Hurricane Hugo? Did she never take ANY trips out of town during those 50+ years? Even trips to Wal-Mart? To the bathroom? I just don't get it. And I had to wonder, when Emmy and Heath dug up a box that had been buried for decades -- why weren't the contents moldy? Why wasn't the BOX ruined or moldy? Geez. I agree that the premise (as far as unknown aspects of history) was intriguing (read the author's notes at the end). Likewise, the bottle tree information was interesting. I just don't think the author was up to representing this era, or the atmosphere of the beach, for that matter. Maybe I would have liked it better when I was 20 years old. I gave it 2 stars for effort."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2698688-jennifer", "userReview": "From my blog...[return][return]Filled with emotion, longing, secrets and hope, On Folly Beach by Karen White is a beautiful look at two women, brought together by circumstances unknown to the other, who learn they may not be as dissimilar as they each originally believed. The story is told alternating between present day Folly Beach 2009 and 1942 Folly Beach the year that changed so many lives. Emmy, at the urging of her mother, drives to Folly Beach to consider purchasing Folly's Finds from Abigail Reynolds and to rent a cottage from Abigail's son Heath. However before even entering the home, Emmy encounters Lulu O'Shea, the creator of the bottle trees, and Heath's great-aunt, an acerbic woman who does not take a liking to Emmy. Lulu, now into her 70's has seen a lot, held onto secrets as well as heartbreak and is uncertain of her new business partnership with Emmy. Emmy begins uncovering secret notes in books and longs to learn about the past and about Lulu's sister Maggie and cousin Cat, yet Lulu is extremely good with secrets. On Folly Beach is a beautiful look into the fragile and complex lives of people and the lengths they will go to hold on to secrets, past hurts, and grudges. White's characters are fantastically created and quite easy to imagine knowing. White weaves together a tale spanning three generations of women and the men they loved and lost due to war. On Folly Beach is a captivating, mysterious and at times heart breaking novel that will keep the reader engaged until the very end. I would recommend On Folly Beach to all readers and encourage discussion groups to choose this book."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1494253-angie", "userReview": "I very much enjoy Karen White's writing, and this was no exception. I just couldn't put the book down today (luckily it was a \"snow day\" so it was okay to binge read)! There is a lot to offer here and a lot going on. It was not hard to follow the 2 timelines, though and each had great things to offer a reader. As you read, you try to sort out the different family mysteries that the truth of have become almost lost over time. It is both heartbreaking and heartwarming, and studies the lengths we will go to protect those we love from hurt and disappointments. I would've liked just a but more explanation/closure on one storyline, but I'm sure its details are left out purposefully to allow the reader to draw their own conclusions. Loved the characters and the setting, and am excited to read more of her books this year"}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3423663-meg", "userReview": "Emmy Hamilton arrives in Folly Beach, South Carolina with a heavy heart. Her beloved husband, Ben, has been killed while fighting in Afghanistan; her mother, though compassionate, can barely stand for the grief of it all. Devastated at having to watch her own daughter lose someone so dear to her, Emmy\u2019s mother encourages her to travel to the East Coast and purchase an old bookstore \u2014 Folly\u2019s Finds \u2014 after purchasing boxes of old books on eBay.Sifting through the novels, Emmy begins to feel a kinship to whomever owned the books before \u2014 especially after she begins finding handwritten notes in the margins, many of them with a loving or longing quality to the words. Since her mother has such fond memories of Folly\u2019s Finds and Emmy is almost completely adrift, lost and without purpose, the idea of getting away \u2014 to another place, another time, a world about which Ben knows nothing \u2014 becomes . . . if not appealing, then not unappealing.Life on Folly is a different animal. Emmy rents a cottage from Abigail Reynolds\u2019 (no relation to the author!) son, Heath, a contractor with a past of his own. As Emmy adjusts to island time, meets the locals and is introduced to Lulu, Heath\u2019s great-aunt, a tapestry of a story begins to unfurl.Karen White\u2019s On Folly Beach is, in fact, two stories skillfully told at once: Emmy, living in the present day and nursing her grief like a child; and Lulu, a woman who grew up during World War II and became quite adept at keeping secrets. Intertwined with Emmy\u2019s portions of the novel in 2009 are stories from 1942, when Lulu was a child living with Maggie, her older sister, and Cat, their wild and recently widowed cousin. At 19, Cat was beautiful, seductive \u2014 and living dangerously, much to the anger of her cousins. All orphaned, the three girls lived on Folly Beach decades before Emmy arrived \u2014 but there may be more linking them than Emmy first realizes.Take several love stories, plenty of intrigue, a giant mystery, some supernatural qualities \u2014 then shake it all up, pour it out and take a long drink. White\u2019s novel, set in the South, has a small-town charm with plenty of questions lurking just beneath the surface of the text \u2014 and that\u2019s what I loved most about it. Like Tradd Street and Legare Street, Emmy possess an almost metaphysical ability to \u201cknow\u201d things before they happen \u2014 or while they\u2019re happening, as the case may be. The fact that White doesn\u2019t make A Big Deal about this reminds me of Sarah Addison Allen\u2019s novels, which I love, in that characters are just . . . sort of magical. I love the unexpected touches so much that I don\u2019t question them.And Maggie\u2019s romance. I loved it. I was absolutely, totally swept up in it \u2014 which is how I felt through the majority of the novel. Caught up in an age where ordinary Americans blacked out their windows, fearing German attacks, and young women were trained to spot enemy aircraft approaching the shores. When rationing kept silk stockings and sugar off store shelves, and thousands of young men left home and never came back. A lover of history and historical fiction, it\u2019s hard for me to imagine what life was like in 1942 \u2014 and that\u2019s why I read books. So I can feel like, even in a tiny way, I might begin to understand.The interplay between sisters and family reminded me of Elizabeth Berg\u2019s Dream When You\u2019re Feeling Blue, another novel I adored. Lovers of historical and contemporary fiction will be taken in by the secrets, mysteries and questions in this atmospheric drama. And having closed the final page, I can still hear the siren song of the Atlantic Ocean calling me."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/177641-staci", "userReview": "This book has so much going for it...Southern location, bookstores, Nancy Drew, book lovers, loss loves, broken hearts, an intriguing mystery and strong family connections. There wasn't a page that I didn't enjoy reading and even though I wanted desperately to see how Emmy and Lulu's stories would end, I truly didn't want this book to run out of pages!!! I love how White took historical facts and weaved them into her story. It really made everything come alive and I could visualize each character, smell the ocean, and feel the heartbreak.For me a good book not only entertains, but also can help expand my knowledge of history and folklore. I've never heard of bottle trees nor had any idea about the stories behind them. Slaves from Africa thought that you could capture evil spirits within the bottles, thus keeping you safe from harm. When the sun rose the next day, the spirits were then destroyed. She headed down the street without glancing back, hearing again the sound of the wind crying into the necks of open bottles, afraid of what she might see if she did.p.180Add to this, the time period of World War II,German U-boats off the eastern coastline, Foreign spies and you really have an interesting history lesson going on. History came alive within this book and I felt connected to each time period and to all of the characters. Even the ones that I didn't like so much on a personal level. I feel that she told Emmy and Lulu's story with incredible insight and she made you understand that even though they're separated by years in age, that when you lose someone you love during wartime, the loss and the feelings experienced are universal. I could easily see myself re-reading this one at some point and I normally don't re-read anything! Looks like I'm going to have to visit Folly Beach and bring this book with me!

Sometimes I get into a reading funk where I start a lot of duds and have to abandon them. This month has been the opposite of that. Reading heaven!So, my friend Ellen recommended I read The Beech Trees, another book by Karen White, but our library didn't have it so I reserved this one instead. And she was right, Karen White is wonderful. One thing I loved about her is that every sentence was beautifully crafted, and feelings were described in a new and interesting way. This is the kind of book that made me sigh after particularly lovely paragraphs, thinking \"Thank heaven for books written for grown-ups!\"This is the kind of book where a woman from the present, Emmy, starts researching an event from generations back, and her life story begins to merge with the past one while everyone learns from each other. Emmy has recently lost her husband, and I loved the concept she used of the \"last first.\" The night after he died was the last first time she'd have to sleep in a bed without him. When months later she drove to a beach town states away, she started the last first road trip she'd take without him. The unspoken presumption is that the first time would be the hardest, and after that she'd at least know she could do it. That feels like something I would use as some small comfort after a loved one's death, and I know there would be a million little activities I'd think that about. And I loved watching as Emmy slowly made a new life for herself and found joy again.The only thing I didn't love about the book was that near the end the past story got a touch too dramatic and unlikely for me.

I love Karen White. She has become one of my favorite authors. She is very creative with her stories and I usually am in complete love with her writing. I didn't feel that with this book even though it was a great story and it had a nice sense of place, regarding both time periods. With this book, the main thing that was a miss for me were the characters. In the beginning they were so unlikable and the dialogue between the love interests was so painful. It was very stilted.

There her story intersects with that of Lulu and her now dead sister Maggie who owned the store during WWII. The author skillfully weaves history, drama, espionage, love, and loss into a simmering pot of page-turning pleasure. This is a great \"escape book\" for those times when you just need to get your mind off of your other worries. Examples of the author's writing I find rich and poignant: Emmy has just moved from the midwest to Folly Beach, South Carolina, and is seeing the ocean for the first time: \"She's seen oceans in movies, and in her mother's photographs, but now, standing in front of the great Atlantic, she felt the pulsing of the waves, felt the power and breadth of the water as it bled out into the horizon, endless and liquid like the earth's lifeblood. It made her feel alive, unlike anything she'd felt under the broad flat skies of home. As she stared out at the dark blue vastness, her veins seemed to pump with the ancient rhythm of the waves, giving her kinship to every person who'd ever lived by the water, yet at the same time making her feel very, very insignificant.\" If you're a lover of the beach, this captures some of the mystery and powerful appeal.Later, her mother visits the beach after being gone for decades, still mourning the loss of infant sons years ago, but finally able to travel with her husband: \"...it's been...reviving. I know that's an odd word, but that's how it feels. Like I've been taking shallow breaths for years and finally learned how to fill my lungs.\" This was back to the caliber of White's first book The Memory of Water."}, {"userName": "Lyn (Readinghearts)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2124637-lyn-readinghearts", "userReview": "I had never read a book by Karen White before, but if they are all like this one, I will be reading more. One of the things that I really like about my on-line book clubs is that I end up meeting people who can introduce me to wonderful new authors. Folly Beach, South Carolina is a small island whose main population is summer tourists. In the 1940s, though, in the thick of WWII, it was a place for many soldiers to gather. This book tells two stories of Folly Beach, one current and one from the 1940s.  Cat, Maggie, and Lulu are permanent residents of Folly Beach in 1941. Cat is the beautiful one, Maggie the practical one, and Lulu is the one who does not miss a thing. As WWII progresses, it has a large impact on their lives and their relationships with each other. Sixty-six years later, in 2009 Emmy moves to Folly Beach to get a change of scene after her young husband is killed in Afghanistan. A lover of books, she purchases the book store that used to belong to Maggie in the 1940s, and discovers a Folly Beach mystery that has been hidden for years. This book contains the blending of the two stories, the story of Cat, Maggie, and Lulu, and the story of Emmy and her new beginning. Karen White did a wonderful job of blending the two stories. In addition, both stories are wonderful in themselves, not only filled with wonderful characters, but with hope, longing, and love. I especially liked that the stories had wonderful, true to life ending. This book was definitely a hit."}, {"userName": "Debbie Robson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1743317-debbie-robson", "userReview": "As most people who follow my reviews know, I rarely cross to the dark side (commercial fiction) in my reading. In fact there\u2019s usually only two reasons why I do and they are 1. subject matter that fascinates me and this is rare and 2. a place that I want to read about. On Folly Beach by Karen White fits into both categories. Folly Beach South Carolina is a place that my character Jane Townsend visits in my novel Crossing Paths. It is a brief visit but my research into the place has ensured that I will always be interested the location and I simply love reading about books set during WWII. 1939 to 1945 is such a fascinating and sad time. I am continually drawn to it and hey, you\u2019ve got to love a main character who buys a bookstore. Emmy Hamilton is recently widowed and not coping at all with her grief. I actually preferred the present day timeline to the one set in the early 1940s and usually with such a book it is the other way around. The reason I think is that Maggie in 1943 is a very frustrating character and sometimes annoying to boot. Whereas I found I wanted to spend time with Emmy as she gradually returned to the world about her. I think this is one of the strengths of the book - the depiction of Emmy\u2019s state of mind.I found several things that set this book apart for me. Firstly the bottle tree that ties both timelines together, the mysterious and cranky Lulu and White\u2019s choice of the books that hold the hidden messages. A perfect book to take you away from your own world.

This intriguing novel is the perfect mix of mystery and history. The mystery begins when a young widow finds notes written in the margins of books. The notes take her on a journey to the 1940s as she discovers the secrets of a South Carolina family. This book is also about book lovers, which always immediately helps me identify with the characters.This book was a great choice for our book club party, especially for the history buffs. We had fun discussing the characters, who each had secrets of their own.The reference to bottle trees was an interesting feature of the book. They were used by slaves to scare away evil spirits and in the book were used to communicate with loved ones. Lulu loved the bottle trees, which was fitting for a young girl who had so many ghosts in her life. One main theme of On Folly Beach is knowing when one has waited long enough to move on after the loss of a loved one. Emmy's mom told her \"Love doesn't have a time span.

Her writing voice is amazing and never ceases to thrill me. For me, On Folly Beach was an intricate, intriguing and delicate blend of two stories interwoven into one. There is the story of Emmy Hamilton who has lost her beloved husband, Ben, to the war in Afghanistan. With his death, comes the end of Emmy's dreams and plans for the future. It is not until Emmy's mother gives her a push (as well as the appearance of a box of books that hold mysterious and heart wrenching messages) that she ventures to buy a bookstore in Folly Beach. However, Emmy is soon to discover that with the bookstore, comes a not-so-easy-to-like elderly woman named Lulu. Enter the second story - sisters Maggie and Lulu and their story, which takes place in the early forties and during WWII. Maggie, with a heart of gold, has known heartbreak, love and patience. She is the owner of the store on Folly Beach, as well as caretaker of her little sister Lulu. With mysterious twists, turns and gripping events, the reader will fall into the lives of these women, become entranced and unable to resist continuing from page to page, until the very end.As I mentioned, Karen White interweaves these stories and time periods together, in a seamless and perfectly timed way. Though the time periods and stories change from chapter to chapter, this is done in such a way that it is like a puzzle fitting snugly together. The past and present reflect perfectly upon one another as the story progresses. I also want to mention the slight hint of the paranormal, which Ms. White sprinkles throughout On Folly Beach, is a delightful added bonus to the story as well. Her ability to bring the South to life is breathtaking and makes reading the story of these women, all the more appealing. Whether you are already a fan of Karen White or have yet to enter her magical world of words, On Folly Beach is an excellent read, that is sure to appeal to a vast audience. I have yet to be disappointed by one of this author's books and I am thrilled to say that this one is just as radiant as her previous works. I highly recommend On Folly Beach for anyone looking for a great story that will stick with them!

There are alot of subplots that move into each other and the last 50 pages or so put everthing together. Does the guy get the girl in the end? I'm not sure, but the book certainly shows how family secrets and lies can do nothing but harm."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3332895-lori", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this...

I\u2019ve read almost all now. It took me a little while to get into this story, but I\u2019m glad I did. It really explored grief and how we all approach and go through it differently. I loved the setting at Folly Beach and the bookstore of course! The characters all spoke to me in different ways and I liked where everyone ended up at the end."}, {"userName": "Cindy Hatok", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54686305-cindy-hatok", "userReview": "I usually love Karen White books, this one seemed to drag and take a long time to read. It's not terrible, but isn't the best one I've read.

But it's the personal battles of Folly Beach's residents that have left the most scars, and why a young widow has been beckoned there to heal her own...   To most people, Folly Beach is simply the last barrier island before reaching the great Atlantic. To some, it's a sanctuary for lost souls, which is why Emmy Hamilton's mother encourages her to buy the local book store, Folly's Finds, hoping it will distract Emmy from the loss of her husband.  Emmy is at first resistant. So much has already changed. But after finding love letters and an image of a beautiful bottle tree in a box of used books from Folly's Finds, she decides to take the plunge. But the seller insists on one condition: Emmy must allow Lulu, the late owner's difficult sister, to continue selling her bottle trees from its back yard.  For the most part Emmy ignores Lulu as she sifts through the love letters, wanting to learn more. But the more she discovers about the letters, the more she understands Lulu. As details of a possible murder and a mysterious disappearance during WWII are revealed, the two women discover that circumstances beyond their control, sixty years apart, have brought them together, here on Folly Beach. And it is here that their war-ravaged hearts can find hope for a second chance...", "title": "On Folly Beach", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7250052-on-folly-beach", "average": 4.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348986504l/7250052.jpg", "reviews": 1060, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/160033.Karen_White", "name": "Karen   White"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Womens Fiction", "Romance", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7250052-on-folly-beach", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10303549-on-folly-beach", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8025384-on-folly-beach", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4505161-the-house-on-tradd-street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398961-the-sound-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10283872-the-beach-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6330979-the-girl-on-legare-street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15812794-the-time-between"]}
