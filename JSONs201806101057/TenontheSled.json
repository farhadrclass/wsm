Instead, the nine-year-old caught on to the similarities to Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed and thought it was cute.The illustrations are beautifully rendered with great expressions on the animals. What I enjoyed about the story, of course, is that it reminded me of my favorite Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed, but also the words used in each example. When one \"fell\" off the sled, they would spill, or whirl, or squeeze out, etc... They would duck under, hold tighter, glide and ride. The variety is very well done.I think the words used are what are most important in this story for teaching similarities and variety to a child. The illustrations and sing-song style of the story seem to hold their interest.Review by Dorine from a borrowed library book."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "Rollicking . . .

One by one the animals fall off until it\u2019s just the caribou. Once it\u2019s just him, he invites all his friends back on because sledding alone is no fun!Professional Recommendation/Review #1: Kirkus, 2010A caribou, polar bear, moose, wolf, walrus, squirrel, bighorn sheep, fox, hare and seal all pile onto a toboggan, beginning a North Country riff on the familiar chant: \"There were TEN on the sled / and the caribou said, / 'Slip over! Slide over!' / So they all slid over, / and Seal spilled out.\" One by one, the animals tumble off, each with a different active verb (Hare hops out, Sheep shoots out, Walrus whirls out, etc.). The final line of each stanza is printed with lively disorder, swooping, jumping and sliding on the page. Woodruff adds extra humor by collecting all of the fallen animals in an increasingly bigger snowball that rolls down the hill alongside the toboggan. What with animal identification, counting, vocabulary building and print awareness all scaffolded on a can't-lose rhyme, this one's a keeper.Professional Recommendation/Review #2:Randall Enos (Booklist)Ten on anything is never a good idea. In this case, 10 animals on a sled in the Arctic become 1 lonely caribou as one by one the riders exits are described in alliterative action words: Seal spilled out. Hare hopped out. Sheep shot out. The sled gains momentum, while the displaced animals are picked up by a giant snowball, which races alongside the sled. All 10 reach the bottom at the same time in a tame, anticlimactic ending only to leap on for one more run / and a little more fun / in the moonlit land / of the midnight sun. Although it s not the most thrilling ride, children will enjoy the anticipation as each cartoon-style animal is booted off. The counting down as the sled goes along adds to the fun, while descending numbers and action verbs are emphasized with a colored font.Response to Two Professional Reviews:The first review by Kirkus I thought was spot on. I wish it mentioned how easy it is to sing along. I think this book would be a hit in any classroom or home. The second review seemed to be somewhat negative towards the book, but I liked how he mentioned the alliteration and action verbs as an important aspect to the book. Evaluation of Literary Elements:This book is perfect for children who love a silly, up-tempo book. The characters are all arctic animals (naturally since it takes place on a snowy mountainside) and all have their own personalities. Each one falls off the sled in a silly way and the illustrations add to each of their personalities. For a counting book, the language used seems challenging. The action verbs used are some that seem to be advanced, but with older children this book could be a lot of fun in teaching different verbs. Consideration of Instructional Application:In a classroom many things can be done with this book. First, we could have number magnets on the whiteboard or on small trays that children could take off in order of how many were left throughout the story. Another application with older children is to focus more on the verbs and have the class try to act out the verb of the animal that fell off the sled!"}, {"userName": "Chelsea Williams", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38896975-chelsea-williams", "userReview": "This is a wonderful little story about counting backwards from 10.

(Picture book. 3-6)School Library Journal (December 1, 2010)PreS-Gr 1-In this counting book, a caribou and his Arctic friends pull a toboggan uphill; with 10 aboard, they speed down the mountain. One by one, they fall off the sled: \"Seal spilled out,\" \"hare hopped out,\" \"sheep shot out,\" and so on. While squirrel, who is wearing a skull-and-crossbones hat, squeezes out of polar bear's paws onto a pine-tree branch and almost gets struck by a zooming pinecone. All those wipeouts create a big snowball made of the various animals, and the race is on. Will it be the snowball or the sled that reaches the bottom first? Part of the fun of sledding is to trudge back up the hill to do it again, and that is what happens. The comic-style illustrations in watercolor have hints of pastel and colored pencil, especially in the sky, which gives the landscape a winter warmth while the characters themselves exhibit a playful, cheery spirit. Colored typeface for each number from ten to one adds to the page design, and alliteration plays a part in the rhyming pattern.
