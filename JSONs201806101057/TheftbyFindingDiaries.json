I liked it a lot...but it grew on me. I only listened to about 1 or 2 hours of it a day. It was 13+ hours long in length. I would have gone crazy listening \u2018or\u2019 reading this type of book without breaks. There \u2018is\u2019 a tedious feeling when David reads a date of a diary entry - followed by another date/location and paragraph type diary entry...on and on and ON!Some of it didn\u2019t feel any more personal than calling off names at a High School graduation, but after awhile - something happens. And we feel EMOTIONS. Then I remembered:David gave a clear warning at the start of what this book was anyway. He almost didn\u2019t publish it. It\u2019s from years ago. 1977-2002 just as the title says. I doubt if this were a first book, that any major publishing company would have touched it. But..., given who David is, that changes things. I experienced another side of David....., tender, sweet, soft spoken, and he \u2018felt\u2019 years younger & vulnerable. There was much sadness - especially the first half.His funny bone shines brighter in the second half. David shares about poverty - sex - racism - drugs - ( he really paints a vivid picture of the 70\u2019s), religion - a moving experience with 911-and lots daily random things from his life. When people say the expression \u201cthat guy could read the phone book and make it interesting\u201d...well, somebody must have been thinking about David Sedaris.I ended up enjoying my time listening to David\u2019s tedious dairy entries - his dry wit - and his child like being in the world. He\u2019s adorable!"}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Before I even begin this ramble, I feel a disclaimer should probably be provided regarding these 4 Stars. If you have not yet had the privilege of experiencing David Sedaris\u2019 essays, you most definitely should not begin with Theft By Finding. Pick up any one of his other collections and read that first. Then repeat. Repeat again until you reach superfan status and you\u2019ve started fantasizing about how delightful it would be to wear him around like a skinsuit as a beck-and-call-boy for your constant amusement. That\u2019s totally normal, right????\nRight. When you reach that point of fandom, you\u2019re ready for this.Theft By Finding: Diaries 1977-2002 is exactly what the title states \u2013 various diary entries that span several decades. Sedaris himself said this book should be read in snippets. If you are of the ilk, this would be a perfect selection to have readily available whilst sitting on the throne. Since my gastrointestinal system is of the \u201call or nothing\u201d variety (TMI??? Naaaaaah!) and I wouldn\u2019t dream of defiling my lobster\u2019s work in that manner, I can\u2019t confirm or deny if this is the way to go. I can, however, confirm that the early years are a rough read as you follow Sedaris from his 20s in Raleigh where he more than dabbled in methamphetamines and underemployment as a starving artist while consuming daily feasts at the local IHOP. You LITERALLY read the phone book as well as random recipes and lists of what he got for Christmas and various other nonsense like what happened that day on As the World Turns or the off-color joke a co-worker told him that day.If you can get through the first 20% or so, it becomes smoother sailing. David puts down the meth pipe and details his initial successes as a playwright in New York City all the way to becoming a best-selling author and residing in Paris. He lets you in on his family history \u2013 including his mother\u2019s death and his sister\u2019s battle with mental illness and includes some truly poignant entries . . . . . \n\u201cLast night under the stars in a pasture in our sleeping bags, I poured my guts out and said things I was afraid to admit even to myself. And you know, it felt good and not as hopeless as I thought. All that had been inside for so long.\u201d\nWhile I could have lived without the never ending submissions regarding his various French classes, unforgettable moments in history are documented within its bindings . . . . \n\u201cThere is a new cancer that strikes only homosexual men. I heard about it on the radio tonight.\u201d\n\n \u201cHugh and I awoke to the news that Princess Diana has been killed, literally hounded to death by photographers.\u201d \n\n \u201cLast night on TV I watched people jump from the windows of the World Trade Center.\u201d \nAs well as monumental moments in his personal history . . . . \n\u201cThis spring I am, if I\u2019m not mistaken, in love.\u201d\nMost importantly, around the 25% mark Amy moves to the same town and made my life complete when her various antics began being included . . . . \n \u201cAmy and I went to Hoffritz to find Dad a Father\u2019s Day gift. Our original idea was to buy him a knife, but in the end we spent $72 on a vibrator. It\u2019s a Panasonic with a long stem and a thickish disk on top, designed so you can reach behind yourself and work out the kinks in your back and shoulders. We also figured he\u2019ll use it on his dog. \u201cOur father\u2019s going to love this,\u201d Amy said to the saleswoman as we laid the vibrator on the counter. The woman smiled. \u201cThe next time we see him, though, I bet his front teeth are all chipped.\u201d The smile faded. \u201d\nAmy is the kind of asshole I dream of becoming one day. Hysterical with absolutely no filter. David and I both tend to be more of the \u201cGeorge Constanza\u201d variety when not in writing . . . . .\nThere was little to no doubt in my mind when I requested an advanced copy that I would be denied so I immediately put myself on \u201cpre-hold\u201d at the library well before the release date. Words cannot express how happy I am now that I did not read this early, since it allows me to quote the story that caused quite the embarrassing moment at work . . . . \n\u201cLisa told me that the previous day she\u2019d accidentally put a used Kotex through the wash. It went through the dryer as well, and when it came out, Bob held it up, saying, \u201cThese aren\u2019t supposed to be laundered on their own, are they?\u201d Lisa said she guessed not, and Bob asked why she\u2019d washed just one of them. \u201cI looked for the other and couldn\u2019t find it anywhere.\u201d \u201cThe other?\u201d Lisa said. \u201cShoulder pad,\u201d Bob said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what we\u2019ve been talking about?\u201d He handed here the fluffy clean Kotex, still warm, and she put it in her dresser drawer until he left the room.\u201d\nI read that during lunch yesterday and while I was trying to muffle my laughter, my supervisor confused the noise for hysterical sobbing. At that point there was no way I was going to be able get myself back under control and, well . . . . \nDue a combination of Sedaris\u2019 epic rise in fame here in flyover country along with my crippling phobia of strangers in crowds, I most likely will never be brave enough to attend one of his readings and officially declare us besties for the resties. But we\u2019ll always have our mutual love of America\u2019s best television program as an unbreakable bond . . . . \nAnd he won\u2019t have to bother getting one of those pesky restraining orders against me. Winner winner chicken dinner. You\u2019ll always be my lobster, though, David.

He started off with brief statements and observations of his day. I guess 1977 to 1983 are his really \"bleak\" years. Which are typical when you're young, broke and no real goals in life. I think many of us could relate. He's starting to sound a little humorous.\"The diary lightened up when I moved to Chicago, partly because I was in a big city and because I felt better about myself.\" David attended and graduated from the Art Institute here, where many fabulous entries; particularly his writing times at his favorite IHOP near his neighborhood. Bountiful years And he's still alive.In 1990 David moves to NYC and the world really opens up to him. Tons of cleaning jobs to earn some cash, millions to observe, and times to write, day or night. He meets Hugh here, thank goodness, gets himself together a bit more, and starts to become the success he is today. You know, that quirky little guy that a reads his books out loud at all different venues; and we pay our hard-earned money to buy tickets to go listen to him, willingly. What a racket! He's really funny though and we all like him. I myself have all his books in print form and audio. Personally, I like sarcasm.So diary, it's worth it, I get my own copy today! Amazon is going to drone it over. I'm lying, I pre-ordered it. But I am going to also listen on audio, so much better when David reads it to you. Still, what a racket! Met David at the Aronoff Theatre in Cincinnati, OH. The show was great and he signed my book. He told us his next book will be published May, 2018. Okay Netgalley, I hope it'll be available for request. I'm really disappointed that there are not any pictures in this book. That \"New Yorker\" article recently got my hopes up for pictures. Oh well. Thanks to Netgalley and Little, Brown and Company for the ARC.Yay, got tkts to see David in October at the Aronoff Theatre."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5211606-julie", "userReview": "David Sedaris explains in the Introduction of his new book that \u201cin the U.K., if you discover something of value and keep it, that's theft by finding.\u201dThus a great title was born, and it suits the general theme of David's diaries. But, I have a suggestion for two alternative titles for this collection, one borrowed from Garth Brooks: \"Friends in Low Places\" and the other stolen from William Shakespeare: The Comedy of Errors.Before I proceed, I want to clarify: I am a Sedaris lover, not a hater. I love the guy's writing. I've read all but one of his books of published essays.But, I feel compelled to say this: If you are not an established reader of Sedaris's work, I would not recommend that you start here. Go read When You Are Engulfed in Flames or Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim.Start where Sedaris writes with some polish and some humor, not with the origins of his writing, the \u201cbare bones,\u201d if you will. These are stark observations, and they may or may not appeal.It's not that this book isn't often hilariously funny; it is. It's not that this book isn't sometimes poignant; surprisingly, it's that, too. It's just that. . . if you don't know David's writing, I'm not sure you're going to make it past page 75.Frankly, David's diary entries from the late 1970s/early 1980s are fairly disgusting. He was a hard core substance abuser at the time, and I found it depressing to read about someone so desperate, down on his hands and knees, snorting an unknown white powder he has found, in the hopes that it is cocaine, or sniffing bags of glue and tempera paint because he has run out of money for better drugs. Also, he shares many anus-focused ruminations (I don't know how else to say this politely!), and these entries contain almost ridiculous amounts of the \u201cn\u201d word, the \u201cp\u201d word and the \u201cc\u201d word. I don't mean to suggest that David himself is \u201cusing\u201d these words (both racism and misogyny disgust him); he is just surrounded by the absolute dregs of humanity in scenario after scenario, and these losers love these words, and David reports them.For me, the highlight was the center of the book, the mid-80s through the mid-90s, when David starts to get his act together, meets the love of his life and stops living on the total fringe of decent society. This is where the diary entries are laugh-out-loud funny, and I was actually taking pictures of passages and sending them to my sister, who is a Sedaris fan who has not yet received her copy. Ironically, once his life becomes really stable, his regular observations became somewhat boring and my feverish reading slowed, though he did take me to a tender place regarding the premature loss of his mother. That aspect of his writing has always been relatable to me.For established Sedaris fans, this is a mostly fun read, despite the degrading and loathsome accounts of humanity it reveals, but, personally, I'm holding out for new material. Come on, David, let's hear about life in the U.K.! Crawl under an overpass if you need to, but give us something new!"}, {"userName": "Rachel Le\u00f3n", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21291796-rachel-le-n", "userReview": "David Sedaris is funny. And he's funny in his own way. It's like his humor comes in its own flavor that you can't find anywhere else. Which is why when he has a new book come out, it's an event. This book is a collection of Sedaris's old diaries. I winced at the idea for a minute, then decided it'd still be worth reading. I wasn't wrong. This book is funny, introspective, and interesting.

(Of course.) Then, just TWO DAYS LATER, he applies for the Macy's elf gig that the time-traveling reader knows would soon truly launch his career with \"The Santaland Diaries.\" Holy cow. Everything about this guy's life changed (for the better) over the course of three days in October 1990, and at the time he had no idea.

My first exposure to Sedaris was with the excellent When You Are Engulfed in Flames audiobook. With his black humour, wry observations, humanist stories, and morality that never feels cheesy, Sedaris had me hooked. So I was pretty excited when I saw there was not one, but TWO new Sedaris books dropping this year.A bit of a disclaimer that should have been evident to me from the book's cover. This is not a series of essays that follow any arc, nor are they stories, Theft By Finding is a collection of diary entries. Some days are quick snippets, the earlier stories are rougher, and the later entries hew more towards the Sedaris I first met. We follow Sedaris as a young adult dabbling in every drug imaginable, we see him meet many people who would become instrumental in his life, and we see the nuggets that would eventually become his well-known stories.If you're like me, then you'll find a lot of common ground with Sedaris. His professional people watching and documentation of his ludicrous encounters is always spot on. He brings up situations in which I've found myself and has thoughts I've had too. It's always nice to know there's other humans with whom you share some cognition. With an eye for the absurd and a knack for making me laugh, I'm just about guaranteed an enjoyable venture with Sedaris. This would never be my recommendation to a Sedaris newbie--When You Are Engulfed In Flames is my suggestion!--but it still ends up being a pretty enjoyable listen. It functions extremely well as something to put on during the commute, dishes, and was a steadfast companion for my fianc\u00e9 and I during a recent move. It is the audiobook equivalent of the book that's easy to pick up and put down.

When I heard he was publishing his selected diaries, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d read them. I knew many of his essays grow out of episodes recorded in the diary, so would the entries end up seeming redundant? I\u2019d pretty much convinced myself that I was going to give Theft by Finding a miss \u2013 until I won a proof copy in a Goodreads giveaway. This is the first volume, covering 1977 to 2002; a second volume from 2003 onwards is planned.What I most liked about this book is the sense you get of the sweep of the author\u2019s life: from living in his North Carolina hometown and doing odd construction jobs, hitchhiking and taking drugs to producing plays, going on book tours and jetting between Paris and New York City, via an interlude in Chicago (where he attended art school and taught writing). Major world events occasionally make it in \u2013 the Three Mile Island disaster, Princess Diana\u2019s death, the Bush/Gore election, 9/11 \u2013 but for the most part this is about daily nonevents. It\u2019s a bit of a shock to come across a serious moment, like his mother\u2019s sudden death in 1991.One thing that remains constant is Sedaris\u2019s fascination with people\u2019s quirks. For instance, nearly every night for nine years he visited his local IHOP for coffee, cigarettes and people-watching. He seems to meet an inordinately large number of homeless, hard-up and crazy types; perhaps, thanks to his own years-long penury (\nOctober 6, 1981:\n \u201cI\u2019ve paid my rent and my phone bill, leaving me with 43 cents\u201d) and addictions (he didn\u2019t quit alcohol and marijuana until 1999), he feels a certain connection with down-and-outs.By the last few years of the diary, though, he\u2019s having dinners with Mavis Gallant, Susan Sontag, and Merchant & Ivory. This isn\u2019t obnoxious name-dropping, though; I appreciated how Sedaris maintains a kind of bemused surprise about his success rather than developing a feeling of entitlement. He acts almost guilty about his wealth and multiple properties (\u201cI\u2019ve fallen deeper into the luxury pit\u201d). Time spent abroad keeps him humble about his linguistic abilities and gives him a healthy measure of doubt about the American lifestyle; I especially liked his reaction to a Missouri Walmart.The problem with the book, though, is that the early entries are really quite dull. Things picked up a bit by the early 1980s, but it wasn\u2019t until the late 1990s that I realized I was actually finding the entries laugh-out-loud funny like I expect from Sedaris. The book as a whole is too long and inclusive; Simon Cowell would surely call it indulgent. I tried to imagine what would have resulted if an outsider had reduced the complete diaries to a one-volume selection. A cast list and photographs of Sedaris and his family over the years would also be helpful; I\u2019d be interested to know if any supplementary material was added to the final product that did not appear in my proof.Ultimately I think this is only for the most die-hard of Sedaris fans. I will certainly read the second volume as I expect it to be funnier and better written overall. But if \u2013 as appears to be the case from the marketing slogans in my proof \u2013 the publishers are hoping this will introduce Sedaris to new readers, I think they\u2019ll be let down. If you\u2019ve not encountered him before, I suggest picking up Me Talk Pretty One Day or trying one of his radio programs.Some favorite passages:October 26, 1985; Chicago: In the park I bought dope. There was a bench nearby, so I sat down for a while and took in the perfect fall day. Then I came home and carved the word failure into a pumpkin.October 5, 1992; New York: The new Pakistani cashier at the Grand Union is named Dollop.October 5, 1997; New York: Making it worse, I had to sit through another endless preview for Titanic.

I have read 3 of his books after this one, and seen him live once - so I do know his stuff pretty well.Theft by Finding is classic Sedaris form, wry, witty, fully of oneliners and based on his extraordinary powers of observation. It deals with the mundane for the most part, but makes that mundane interesting with remarkable stylistic affect and a fantastic sense of voice.Especially if you listen to this one, you will notice how Mr. Sedaris has a great talent for voices, spoken and written. His impressions are on point, whether it is southern drawl, russian spy, bronx born native, or jewish grandmother. He really does have a voice for radio, and I was astounded that he even remembered the precise tone of voice and accents in this book - given that it is simply a collection of his diaries from the past 20 some odd years.As for cons, the book gets a little too mundane at points and definitely ventures into familiar Sedaris territory. If you have read his previous works you may see some repetition in content here, but delivered differently. It's also interesting to observe his transition from feeble and down-on-his-luck meth head to relatively self-obsessed member of the literati. The beginning of the book as such is more interesting than the end, as I imagine the comforts afforded by his success have made juicy anecdotes harder to come by."}, {"userName": "Book Riot Community", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community", "userReview": "I am a die-hard David Sedaris fan.

I'm one of them.This might also be enjoyable for non-fans, who just like a good salacious diary, something that feels gossipy and gives you the sense that dirt has been properly dished. Most of this dirt however is on himself and the dirt-poor. Theft by Finding covers Sedaris' early years when he was a down-and-out drug addict. There were times when he was a few bucks away from being homeless. But rest assured, he brings out the funny in it all.The early years are fascinating when his struggle was hampered by personality and bad habits. Many will not enjoy this because of that. Or I should say, many do not enjoy this because of that.

This book takes place when David is 21 and poor, starting out on his own and it is interesting as a big fan of his to see how he gets from there to having his books published and living in France in 2002. The one thing that struck me in this diary collection is that David mostly describes his life without emotions getting in the way. I know when I was young and kept a diary, it was full of my emotions and opinions and judgements, more so than what was actually happening in my life. He includes enough funny and strange observations to make this a fun read, but I guess that is his what made him famous and what we all love him for. David\u2019s relationships with his family members were my favorite parts of the book. Reading this makes me want to go back and re-read all of his memoirs. It was really good to \u201cvisit\u201d with him again.Thank you Little, Brown and Company and NetGalley for providing me with a copy."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "\u201cIn the U.K., if you discover something of value and keep it, that's theft by finding,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou're supposed to investigate whether it was lost or stolen, though in this case \u2013 five pounds \u2013 of course you're fine.\u201dTheft by finding. It was, I thought, the perfect title for this book.I've read quite a bit of David Sedaris and his collections of wry and biting essays, and I think it was in Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls that I first learned his work method: Walking around every day with a notebook in his pocket, Sedaris listens in on conversations, interacts with strangers, and otherwise attempts to live a life worth recording; writing it all down in his notebook. At the end of every day, he rewrites these snippets into his diary, and eventually, combs these entries for those stories that would make for wry and biting essays. Theft by Finding: Diaries (1977-2002) is the first of two compilations of forty years of such diary entries, and as Sedaris warns in the foreword, he edited the diaries himself \u2013 leaving out the pages and pages of early meth-fueled rants, but otherwise attempting to provide a fair picture. I guess we'll need to take him at his word. Although Sedaris demurs that he can't imagine anyone reading this book straight through, I did and I found it to be very interesting \u2013 a quite satisfying, if somewhat sketchy, method of memoir. \nIn order to record your life, you sort of need to live it. Not at your desk, but beyond it. Out in the world where it's so beautiful and complex and painful that sometimes you just need to sit down and write about it.\nProbably what I liked best were those entries that marked something I was familiar with from Sedaris' earlier writing \u2013 the day he first met the acidic downstairs neighbour, Helen, in New York; casually noting when he first met his partner Hugh; when he first attended the French lessons in Paris that became the title piece in Me Talk Pretty One Day \u2013 but nearly as satisfying would be all that I didn't know: the early days of poverty and drug- and alcohol-fueled debauchery; that he began his career as a visual artist; that he and his sister Amy made a splash Off-Broadway for years. Sedaris also notes in his foreword that he has never been interested in recording self-reflection \u2013 this is a very outward-facing narrative \u2013 yet he still tells a tale of hard work (days spent as a handyman or furniture mover followed by evenings reading at the IHOP) and the evolution of his art to the written word. And because he's writing to himself, Sedaris never feels the need to explain anything \u2013 in one of his books I had read why he and Hugh moved to France, but here they are just suddenly there; you need to infer when he's on a book tour or just back home visiting family; and it all works.The tone of the book, naturally, evolves over time: Sedaris himself grew from a hitch-hiking dropout to a world-famous, polished writer, and by the end, the entries feel like they're meant to be read by others. Compare an early entry from October, 1977:\nAfter a hotel for $8.50 a night, Ronnie and I found an apartment that's $30 a week for the both of us. I worry about money, but when it's gone, it's gone. I smoked my first cigarette. It's embarrassing, but you do get a buzz off it. I did, anyway, on Davie Street.\nAnd one from December, 2000:\nApparently I don't have AIDS. The French bank received my blood test and approved my mortgage, so, though I haven't yet read it on a piece of paper, I'm guessing I'm negative. This is sort of major, as, for the past fifteen years, I've just naturally assumed I was infected. Every time I sweat at night, every time I get a sore or run a fever, I think that it's finally kicked in. It wasn't always at the front of my mind, but it was always there. It sounds goofy, but it's going to take a while for the news to sink in. I'm not disappointed; I just need to figure out what to do between now and the time I develop cancer.\nI will allow that I might have found this more interesting because of my prior dips into Sedaris' writing, but I'm happy to have read the first volume and am looking forward to the second; I wonder if there will be so many people named Pee Wee and references to wheelchairs in it?"}, {"userName": "Book of the Month", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46126209-book-of-the-month", "userReview": "Master of the humorous essay (and Book of the Month Judge), David Sedaris has built a career based on his witty observations about everyday life, and his diaries contain a treasure trove of raw material that shaped his distinctive writing.

For me, it was also poignant because my young adult life in NYC overlapped with Sedaris's own, and I worked in the book world at the time. We moved in overlapping circles, in overlapping neighborhoods. I attended his readings, hosted him at our shop, and passed him on the street from time to time. The upshot of this is that much of what he wrote about during the 1980s and 90s reminded me of some events and experiences in my own life that I'd long since forgotten. This was a nostalgic pleasure for me.Having said that, I would agree with some other reviewers that the early years of the diaries are fairly boring (I say \"fairly\" because Sedaris is never completely boring, in my opinion) and much of what he writes is already better said in his other books. And by better, I mean funnier; whether or not the diaries are a truer reflection of how his life unfolded is irrelevant to me. I read Sedaris for two reasons: he is an excellent writer, and he is hilarious. I rarely laughed aloud reading these diary entries, which is unusual. Usually, I half suffocate myself at least once before getting to the end of his books. Still, I am glad I read this one, if only for the satisfaction of keeping up with his work."}, {"userName": "Debra Komar", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28593062-debra-komar", "userReview": "4.5 stars. I adore Sedaris and this is a strange and wonderful view into his life. It starts slow - as he warns us it will - but once he moves to New York and becomes serious about writing, it is magical. Watching him fall in love with Hugh and become a writer is a joy. There are the usual brilliant one liners and the cutting observations of odd people. It never feels mean-spirited, Sedaris always finds the humanity. On a side note, I have seen Sedaris read a number of times over the years and have stood in line for hours to get him to sign books. He is spectacular. In the past, however, the readings were always free. This year, if you want to see him in Toronto, you have to pay $40 - 95 to see him at the Air Canada Centre. While I have no doubt he will be brilliant as always, that seems a bit stiff for what is essentially a long commercial for a book. I love you David, just not $95 worth."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg", "userReview": "I'm a big fan of David Sedaris, an author who takes the chaos of the world, sometimes even the worst challenges, and spins it into a unique view. But, you know those fiction books that pretend to be, say, \"found manuscripts which prove grandpa was a vampire...\"? Some of these \"Diaries\" sort of feel that way, as some entries (toward the end of this book) are constructed so beautifully, leading to a typical Sedaris punchline, that you just gotta remember what Sedaris tells us in his introduction: that there was indeed some editing. But so what. The first half is pretty boring but things get funnier as Sedaris hones his skills and gets richer, so maybe he just has more time to write funnier stuff. This is just the first half of his \"Diaries\" and I'll read the rest as well as his next \"real\" book.

A patron had heard a piece on NPR and wanted to track down the author and title. This was, of course, pre-Internet, and even calling our local public radio station didn't elicit the answer...until I heard Sedaris myself reading Santaland Diaries on NPR as I returned to work from a dentist appointment. He'd find that ironic, I think. And thus began my love affair with Sedaris reading his own work, including a chance to see him perform live. His voice is distinctive, to say the least, and his deadpan delivery simply highlights the absurdity he observes in everyday life. These are excepts from early diary entries, mostly before his success and fame, but all absorbing. Santaland is here, in diary form before it was enlarged into a longer piece and even a play, and it's interesting to imagine how it could have grown from those few notes and incidents. I've never tried reading one of his books, but I can't imagine that the impact and my pleasure would be as great as listening to him recount his adventures and the way he elevates the ordinary."}, {"userName": "Jenni", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5808727-jenni", "userReview": "Update 3/8/18: I gave this book another try and listened to it on audiobook instead.

Some of the entries were less interesting than others, but it was easier to \"zone out\" listening to the audio book.I love David Sedaris' other works, but this book is just a collection of diary entries that are neither interesting or entertaining (to me).

For several nights in a row, my poor husband would be almost asleep when I would bust out laughing while reading an entry from one of David Sedaris' diary entries. Let's just say he was not amused. I've been a David Sedaris fan for nearly 20 years and have been looking forward to this book for months. For that reason, I'm not the most unbiased of reviewers. If you've read and enjoyed previous Sedaris books, or if you've had the chance to hear Sedaris read from his diaries before, you'll enjoy Theft by Finding. You'll recognize elements of other stories in the diary entries, but it doesn't feel repetitive to me. Instead I found it interesting to learn the beginnings and back stories of Sedaris stories I've previously loved. The reader will also get insight into some of the harder, not funny parts of Sedaris' life. You can't fault the author for the early diary entries dragging a bit. It's not as if he knew in 1977 that one day these would be shared with the world. The format takes a few years (in book form!) to get used to, and I made a note that the book finds its groove and takes off around 1984. If you've never read Sedaris before, don't start here. However if you are fan, Theft by Finding: Diaries is a must-read.\"In order to record your life, you sort of need to live it. Not at your desk, but beyond it.

This book of selected diary entries seems without question to be for those who know his work and are curious to know more about how the work came to be. As a personal essayist, Sedaris has gleaned material from many episodes in his own life \u2013 and probably does some serious embellishment to ramp up the comic factor. Could his life have really been as outrageous as the essays suggest? Well, maybe. The diary selections show the observant writer in his daily record-keeping of things seen and experienced, not infrequently from his booth at the IHOP.Sedaris claims that he began keeping a diary without a clear goal in mind. He records the mundane, but he has an eye for the bizarre. One may suspect that he lived in gritty neighborhoods for the material they yielded. In the years after early diary entries fed the essays, and the essays found an audience, his diary writing appears to become more attentive, because the observations grow much more detailed. The diary becomes a journal, if I may make that distinction. I surmise that he has learned its value to the task of finding and passing on stories.His raw exposure of family members makes some readers cringe. Others laugh helplessly because they recognize utterly human failings they may even claim themselves. Count me among both the cringers and the laughers. I know that I keep listening to his audio books because of his wild sense of humor, and because I have liked observing him grow older, more appreciative and finally even sober. The diaries tell me how much he truly loves his family. They must love him back to allow some of their outrageous stories to go public.My favorite episodes have centered around learning a foreign language as an adult. When Sedaris lived in France, he attended the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise to learn French. I could relate thoroughly because of my own foreign language struggles as an adult learner. I\u2019ve never read a funnier account of the way a new language surely turns all of us into children. Ergo that was my favorite part of the diary as well.And now I digress:My first look into this book sent me searching through my bookshelves for a book called \u201cWhen Found, Make a Verse Of,\u201d by Helen Bevington. I still can\u2019t find the book, which does not speak well for my organization system. But I remember it well. Bevington kept journals, notating things she saw but also things she read or heard. Many of these notes made their way into her light verse. In \u201cWhen Found, Make a Verse Of,\u201d she placed the original journal note beside the verse it inspired. I remember finding the journal entries even more interesting than the poems. Like Sedaris, Bevington was a note taker with a writer\u2019s ear and eye and an awareness of a good story, though her treatment could not be more different. I loved having a window into her writer\u2019s talent.Bevington\u2019s book title was inspired by Charles Dickens. \u201cWhen found, make a note of,\u201d said Captain Cuttle in \u201cDombey and Son.\u201dGood advice. I\u2019m guessing that the fictitious Captain Cuttle might also have made a writer since he seems to know that life is curious, and there is inspiration everywhere."}, {"userName": "Tom Franklin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/661076-tom-franklin", "userReview": "One of the things I always look for in an autobiography is what the person chooses to leave out. Those items are usually more interesting than some of the things they chose to include.With David Sedaris' book of cherry-picked diary entries there are many things I wanted to know more about that were mentioned tangentially but never directly addressed. These include his decision to quit drinking and drugs; the creative/writing process he went through with his sister Amy when they were writing/acting/producing plays; how he relationship with his long-time boyfriend Hugh went from initial flirtation to moving in together...That said, Theft by Finding is an enjoyable, quick read. His diary entries are, for the most part, very short and presented much like an idea left as a story prompt for the reader to finish. It was one of the few books that I've read where at one point I really wish I had the audiobook version with Sedaris reading it.The catch here, though, is while the entries are brief and usually reports of thoughts or people seen/conversations overheard, there's not a great sense of Sedaris himself here. Sedaris is, at best, a passive observer of his own life. We aren't allowed to see/read how any of the life-changing events personally affect him. There is much humor, yes, but little emotion."}], "description": "David Sedaris tells all in a book that is, literally, a lifetime in the making.For forty years, David Sedaris has kept a diary in which he records everything that captures his attention-overheard comments, salacious gossip, soap opera plot twists, secrets confided by total strangers. These observations are the source code for his finest work, and through them he has honed his cunning, surprising sentences.Now, Sedaris shares his private writings with the world. Theft by Finding, the first of two volumes, is the story of how a drug-abusing dropout with a weakness for the International House of Pancakes and a chronic inability to hold down a real job became one of the funniest people on the planet.Written with a sharp eye and ear for the bizarre, the beautiful, and the uncomfortable, and with a generosity of spirit that even a misanthropic sense of humor can't fully disguise, Theft By Finding proves that Sedaris is one of our great modern observers.
