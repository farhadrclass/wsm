The books all read well as standalones so no worries if you haven't read the other novels. If you have though, you'll recognize Lani as the 'wild' child' Tagama sister, but now, as a new Christian, she is trying to put that past behind her for good. Trouble is, not everyone is willing to forget. Including Ben, who holds a pretty big grudge against her. Perfect fodder for an angsty love story.Not that this story really needs any more angst courtesy of the riveting suspense plot. There's murder, smuggling and danger lurking around every corner. And I just have to mention Fisher, the work-in-progress guide dog! I do love a great canine character to mix things up! A heart-pounding thrill of a read."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2868865-rachel", "userReview": "This book is the fourth and final novel [there is also a Christmas novella in the series called Holy Night] in a Christian suspense and romance series called The Aloha Reef series, as it is set in Hawaii, and, in addition to that, the books all have at least some connection to the sea, shown either through diving, normal swimming, or boating. Because the first three novels focused on pairing up the three Oana siblings, I was wondering what minor character from one of those novels would be starring on this one, and as it turned out, my first guess was wrong. Regardless of that though, the main character in this book is Lani Tagama, the sister of Annie from Black Sands, and in it, we learn not only about some of her history and how she has changed but also about her aunt both in the past and now. Lani's life is also affected by her aunt's past as a villain from back then intersects with the present, putting not only Lani but her new friend Ben and his niece in terrible danger all for varying reasons. Anyhow, I thought the book was well-written and entertaining, and the twists and turns of the plot due to the element of suspense/mystery were quite fun, and I also loved the characters in the book and thought they were portrayed well. It has certainly earned its place on my favorites' list."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3418106-megan", "userReview": "Leilani Tagama is attempting to change her life when she is suddenly blinded by a mysterious shooting at her aunt's coffee farm. As she struggles to live with her new disability, Ben Mahoney is called in to help. Ben uses Fisher, the service dog he is training, to get onto the coffee farm for his own reasons. Soon both Ben and Lani suspect there is more behind the shooting than originally suspected. As they try to figure out what is going on before someone else gets hurt, they also have to work through their own pasts in order to move forward in their lives. Midnight Sea is an exciting read. The story moves quickly and the characters experience real discovery and growth. I wish there was a little bit more development of the \"villain,\" but overall the characters were well-rounded and unique. I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I have all of Coble's work! I would highly recommend her."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2648514-mark", "userReview": "I started reading this series 2 days ago, and finished reading it today. I am pretty sure I had already read the other 3 books in the series, though I don't remember much about them...... but I am positive I never read this, the 4th book in the series. This was an awesome series, but I think this was the best of all 4 books. I thought I knew who the bad guy was all through the book, only to find out I was wrong. I loved the main characters, especially Ben.....very cool guy. I appreciated the message of how God can change people so much and forgive anything they do, and that we have to forgive ourselves also and not hold onto guilt for something God has forgiven.

Now she must learn to navigate in a world of darkness. With the help of an embittered ex-cop, Ben, and a half-trained guide dog, Fisher, Lani discovers she can regain a shadow of her former independence.But strange and dangerous secrets lurk behind the beauty of this seaside paradise. Suspicion grows that this was not a random shooting, but an attempted murder, one with its roots in a hippie commune burned over thirty year ago. Lani realizes she is a target, and that she must find the shooter before he strikes again.REVIEW: This is the final book in Colleen Coble's Aloha Reef series. I have loved every one of them, but have to say I think this one ended the series with a real bang! From start to finish there was something happening that kept me wanting to turn pages faster and faster. One of her best romantic suspense novels yet.I found it very interesting reading about Lani's adjustment to being blind and to learning how to work with a service dog. It was obvious Coble did some research into both these areas. I also loved hearing about the \"hippie commune.\" It brought back a lot of memories of hearing stories about these during that time period as I was a teen/young adult then. Coble had all the common \"beach talk\" down pat since I grew up in California and these were common terms even if you weren't a hippie.This story was rich and complex with secrets, suspense, and sweet romance. The faith thread was realistic as the main characters fought with the ever present question of why does God let bad things happen to good people. Another great series by Colleen Coble. Definitely made it to my 2016 favorite reads list.FAVORITE QUOTES: (Lots of good ones in this book. Here are a few.)\"God doesn't make us do anything. He wast us to love and obey because we want to, not because we have no choice.\"\"Some things only God could make better.\"\"I have to trust God for the results. I have to keep my hands off the wheel. That's freeing when you think about it. I'm free to enjoy what God gives me and let him worry about making it all work out.\"\"Sometimes the relationships that are the most strained are the hardest to lose. You know there's no second chance.\""}, {"userName": "Victor Gentile", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528881-victor-gentile", "userReview": "Colleen Coble in her new book \u201cMidnight Sea\u201d Book Four in the Aloha Reef series published by Thomas Nelson takes us into the life of Lani Tagama.From the back cover: Losing her sight turns Lanie\u2019s world upside down, bringing danger, mystery\u2026and unexpected romance.A seemingly random shooting at her aunt\u2019s coffee farm has left Lani Tagama blind.

Ben despised her, but agreed to teach her how to be blind, when asked by her cousin, Bens former partner on the police force, for help in keeping her safe from the unidentified murder.
