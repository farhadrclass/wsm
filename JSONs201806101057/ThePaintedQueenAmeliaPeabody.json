After reading it, I immediately went and read every book of hers I could find. Then, when I discovered she also wrote under the name Barbara Michaels, I read those. In fact, my very first review on Amazon way back in 1999 was for an Elizabeth Peters book! I loved them all.But most of all, I found I loved her Amelia Peabody series.When Ms. Peters (Michaels/Mertz) passed away in 2013, I was so saddened. Her books brought (and still continue to bring) such joy.When given the opportunity to read The Painted Queen, I was excited\u2026and worried. I\u2019ve never read Joan Hess. Would she do the book and our beloved characters justice?Oh, I\u2019m so happy to say that she did - this is an Elizabeth Peters book! Within a few pages, I forgot my worries and was thoroughly enmeshed in an Egyptian Adventure! Amelia and her cutting wit (and equally dangerous parasol). Handsome Emerson (sigh). Nefret and Ramses and David and, of course, murder and mayhem and tombs (oh my!). Oh, and wondrous secrets from Ancient Egypt.Hess does Peters justice!While I\u2019m very sorry that this is the last book we\u2019ll read from a favorite author, I felt like this book was a little gift to her fans. And I think Ms. Peters would have been absolutely delighted with the end result.And a quick note: you may want to skip the introductions and get right to the treasure of the story. Take the time to read them. They are by people who knew Ms. Mertz (Peters/Michaels) well. They\u2019re funny, touching (have Kleenex), and will give you a chance to get to know your favorite author a little better. Hint: there\u2019s a lot of Amelia in her!And a quick note to Ms. Hess: Thank you for doing our Amelia and her author justice. This fan appreciates it!"}, {"userName": "The Library Lady", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady", "userReview": "There have been examples before of someone taking the unfinished work of a beloved author, and doing a very good job of it. The prime example I would think of is Jill Paton Walsh, who not only took Dorothy L Sayer's Thrones, Dominations and completed it believably, but has gone on to write her own Peter Wimsey mysteries. She occasionally gets a detail wrong, but overall, the transition is nearly seamless. Unfortunately, the selection of Joan Hess to finish this book was not an equally wise decision. She was a good friend of Barbara Mertz (Elizabeth Peters), she had talked about her work with her, she had visited Egypt with her. But her own charming mysteries are modern day books set in the American South, and her writing skills just don't mesh with Peters' work. She doesn't have the feel for the just-before-WWI setting, for the nuances of daily life. Small details, like the mention of \"pita\" and \"hummus\", terms NOT in Amelia's vocabulary, jarred me. The interaction between the characters feels awkward. She may love the characters Peters left behind, but she doesn't catch their voices. I was constantly aware that this wasn't a true Amelia book.What this winds up being is Peters' manuscript combined with very high quality fan fiction. And though I could wish for more Amelia books, from the forwards I gather that Hess clearly isn't planning on writing them. And no matter how well this book sells (and it will) I hope that Mertz's heirs stick to that plan!"}, {"userName": "Moonlight", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7710605-moonlight", "userReview": "I love the Amelia Peabody books. I was won over by Elizabeth Peter's humor and the extraordinary way she wove mystery, archaeology, history and social commentary. She could juggle a cast of dozens and make you feel like each character was a three dimensional human being. I would have loved to read her version of this story.I can't imagine a more daunting task than to try to complete this last novel for her. Amelia's voice was so much a part of Barbara Mertz that to do so successfully is probably too much to ask of any author.I was struck within a chapter or two with how drastically wrong the \"voices\" of the characters were. Their dialog was off. The humor was missing. The story does not transition from scene to scene as flawlessly as I have come to expect from Elizabeth Peters. Worst of all, though, is that characters began behaving wrong. For example, Fatima fights with Emerson, David and Ramses have a bitter disagreement, and Ramses argues for a violent solution before trying a nonviolent one.After awhile, I began tracking errors for entertainment. Fatima is the cook and punishes the Emersons for being late for the meal by burning the meat. Mahmoud is the steward and serves the meals placidly. Amelia is proficient in Hebrew even though she couldn't read or write it in The River in the Sky. Katherine Vandergelt is her oldest friend who has know Ramses since he was born even though the Emersons didn't meet her until Seeing a Large Cat when Ramses was a teen. (I guess I shouldn't have prepared for reading this book by rereading all the Amelia Peabody novels that lead up to the events in this book.)I gave this book one star because it does not measure up to the other books in the series. A good editor familiar with Elizabeth Peter's work should have been able to spot these errors and eliminate them. Someone who loved the Amelia Peabody series, like me, might like to read this to see where Elizabeth Peters wanted to take us. And some sardonic types might take perverse pleasure is seeing how many continuity errors they can find. But unfortunately, I cannot recommend the book."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514422-jane", "userReview": "Like most avid readers of this series, I was eagerly looking forward to spending time with Amelia, Emerson and their family and friends. I realized that it would be a daunting task for Ms Hess to capture the style and wit of Elizabeth Peters writing, but I wasn't expecting a story full of so many errors - errors that are just careless. It's almost like she hadn't read the other books in the series. Things like: Nefret did not have a clinic in Luxor at this time, she had a hospital in Cairo; she didn't go to Paris to recover from the trauma in The Falcon at the Portal, she went to Switzerland; Daod did not have multiple wives and a large family; Amelia carried brandy in her belt of tools not whiskey; she wore trousers as her working costume not a divided skirt; Catherine was not Amelia's oldest friend and did not know Ramses as a baby - he was 16 when they met. These are just a few of the mistakes, there are many, many more. I'm surprised that Elizabeth Peters' long-time editor didn't catch these pointless mistakes. In addition to these errors, there are plot points that don't make sense and people acting out of character and the voices are often wrong. So instead of enjoying this book, I find myself noticing only the errors and saying things like \"Emerson wouldn't act like that\" or \"Amelia wouldn't say that\". I'm only a third-way through this book and I can't believe I'm trying to decide if it's worth it to finish the story. It's very disappointing."}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8615427-renee", "userReview": "After rereading one novel in the Amelia Peabody universe, my excitement for The Painted Queen grew exponentially, as did the poignantly bittersweet ache of returning to my absolute favorite fictional family for the final time. The Painted Queen takes place the year after Falcon, in the lead up to WWI. Cue the drama! Cue the ridiculous adventure!And... I have to admit that I was vastly disappointed. Elizabeth Peters only completed a third of the manuscript prior to her illness, and to a devout student of her work (aka ardent fan girl), the transition between Peters and Hess was obvious. For the majority of the novel, the characters are shells of themselves. The series' strongest trait is its characters, and none of them feel right. It's like reading fan fiction by a writer who is not up to par with all her canonical facts. Ramses: Too honest, too direct, too snappish. And there are no brooding passages, no sardonic self deprecating remarks, no cynicism. Nothing swoon worthy.Nefret does not giggle nor is she as impulsive, brave, or involved as usual, and neither she nor Amelia would nap so frequently or admit it at the very least. Amelia is even more prone to silly bouts of derring do, and it doesn't work as well in this context. I became -- dare I admit it? -- a trifle bored. And the plot inconsistencies: the big one is the location of Nefret's Cairo clinic that Hess has in Luxor. And then the common knowledge of the Lost Oasis. I can't imagine that Amelia would admit that to anyone, especially a new acquaintance. That was a well kept secret. The length of Katherine and Amelia's friendship is also confused with Evelyn, and then there are the flagrant anachronisms. The best part of this is the introduction for MPM: a send off to one of my favorite writers. In the future, I will revisit beloved books in the canon in order to get my Emerson family fix. I did appreciate Hess's attempt to bring closure to this final manuscript. No one can take MPM's place, but Hess does succeed in providing an ode to her and-- of course Amelia's -- indomitable memory. 2.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Magdalena aka A Bookaholic Swede", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379514-magdalena-aka-a-bookaholic-swede", "userReview": "I was thrilled for the chance to read THE PAINTED QUEEN. Before I started to read this book I didn't know that this is the last book in the Amelia Peabody series. Elizabeth Peters never finished it before she died and her good friend, Joan Hess, took over and spent three years working with it before it was released. I have to admit that reading about Elizabeth Peters made me a bit sad about the fact that she never got to finish this book. She was a wonderful person who was a dedicated author who loved writing.READ THE WHOLE REVIEW OVER AT FRESH FICTION!"}, {"userName": "Teri-K", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2524448-teri-k", "userReview": "I love this series. I've read or listened to all of the books several times. But when this book was announced I was skeptical. I don't believe I've ever read a book completed under these circumstances that was nearly as good as the original author's work. But the early reviews were pretty good so I gave it a try, and ended up not finishing it. In fact I returned my audio copy to Audible for a refund. I didn't expect the characters voices to be true - that seems to be a detail only the original author could get right. But I did expect them to act according to character. And I thought the series would be treated with care, which to me means doing your best to get the continuity right. Neither of these things happened.Amelia, Ramses, Nefret, and even Emerson all acted out of character, and when they were in character it often felt forced, not natural. I found myself wondering who these people were that had taken on the persona of characters I knew so well. :(As for continuity, I'm actually not a big stickler for it. Especially when an author comes back and fills in a series I expect some things to be fudged, ignored, or glossed over. Timelines, for instance, often have to be altered. So I didn't think the problems others mentioned in their reviews would bother me that much. It became, however, a matter of what I could bear. Like a roof buried under too many feet of snow, eventually the errors piled up so I just didn't want to read any more. For me the final insult was when Amelia sat down with a lady novelist she'd just met and discussed their adventures at the oasis. No. Just - no. They never discussed this with anyone outside the family. And when they talked among themselves they were careful not to be overheard. Anyone who knows the series well knows that. I don't actually blame Hess for these errors. She has several of her own series to keep track of and doesn't have time in her life to become an expert on Amelia. But they should have found somebody who was an expert and had them check the manuscript. It wouldn't be difficult to find such people, and they took their time releasing this one anyway. So why not take the time and trouble to get it mostly right? To me it feels disrespectful not to bend over backwards to release a final book everyone could be proud of. Instead we're left with this mess that I just couldn't finish. (Though I'm sure some day I'll grab it from the library and read it all. Just not right now, when I've recently reread the series and it's fresh in my mind. I'd rather say goodbye to Amelia and her family with good memories.)I like to think of it as a tribute to Peters that no one can copy her style or capture the characters, place and time like she did. :)"}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/973079-andrea", "userReview": "I adore Amelia and her clan so was extraordinarily excited when this book was announced.Unfortunately, the pacing and dialogue are off, the characters are not themselves, and the plot makes no sense. There are numerous glaring conflicts with the Amelia canon, which drove me nuts. Shouldn't the editor have caught these things? Maybe I wouldn't have noticed had I not re-read the three preceding books in anticipation of this one. I had hoped for a story that would shed more light on the resolution of the trauma at the end of Falcon at the Portal, but all of that pain and suffering was brushed aside and instead there were comic book villains in the form of Geoffrey's family. The archaeology bits are interesting in light of the real controversy around Nefertiti, but there was far less archaeology than in the other books. Instead, lots of naps, baths, flitting around, and odd arguments.

No mention made of the reason Nefret went off to marry Geoffrey or where that \"reason\" was. No mention of Walter or Evelyn? Amelia saying \"Inshallah\"? I was thrown out of the story constantly.

I was intrigued and excited that, yes, Amelia would be gracing us one final time. And then suddenly, she was here, in the rough stage, maybe, but here nonetheless. I vowed to read slowly, and slowly I did.Here's a confession. When was in the first few chapters, and even at times near the end, I experienced what I can only describe as psychological block. I felt as though there was a strange barrier between me and the characters. I can only assume this is because another author was attached to the writing. I think knowing this had me so worried everything would be different, that I couldn't settle at first. Maybe reading so slowly exacerbated this feeling, or maybe in the long-run, being able to reflect on the contents of each chapter helped me recognize the characters for who they've always been.Ms. Hess did not disappoint me. I eventually was able to see past the fact that this wasn't 100% MPM, and fell into the story with pleasure. Amelia and Emerson were FANTASTIC. I was laughing often at their banter with each other and other characters, as I followed the fantastical mystery along, fully enjoying how so very Amelia Peabody it was. So many assassins, so little time.AND SETHOS. GUYS, SETHOS WAS A DREAM. All the crazy disguises and appearances had me in stitches. I think that perhaps he won the day with this book. The sass was strong as ever, and his interactions with Ramses were amazing.I think my only issue with it was that Ramses and David felt a little off to me at times. I think this was mostly due to them saying things occasionally that didn't strike me as quite Them. And I was sad at the lack of Nefret, and a little surprised at the lack of interaction she had with Ramses. Now, obviously, I understand that they probably can't even stand to look at each other what with Falcon being the previous book in the timeline, but I was hoping for something verbal to illustrate the stress between them. Mostly, we get the idea through Amelia's observations of the pair. Perhaps some of these little things will be altered in the official copy, since I know some changes were definitely made.One of my favorite things about this book were all the little Easter eggs thrown in, which the Reader will certainly recognize when he or she comes across them. They'll make you smile very hard!!!As all of you who have read this Amelia and all the others know the feeling, suddenly I hit the last chapter. I couldn't really believe this was it, despite the July release, and I had to mentally prepare myself. In the words of JK Rowling, all was well. The ending showcases Amelia in all her vivacious glory, and I couldn't have been happier with it. The fact that Painted Queen takes place primarily in Amarna seems to me a wonderful way to bookend a series that has been so much to me these past few years, and I give my thanks to MPM, Joan Hess, and Salima Ikram for their hard work in giving us this final, wonderful Peabody adventure."}, {"userName": "Wendy Benavides", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30033529-wendy-benavides", "userReview": "Disappointing.It seems the author was trying too hard and fell short.

After their last season was cut tragically short, they hope to finish excavations where they left off and hope Emerson will keep from enraging M. Maspero (again) long enough to get a firman for a better location. The season gets off to an exciting start when a murderous thug enters Amelia's private chamber intent on harm when someone intervenes to stop the attack. Surprised and confused, Amelia sets about trying to figure out who her enemies are (the list is long). Emerson, on the other hand, is determined to protect the love of his life with his own brute strength and sheer will no matter what. Meanwhile, Ramses and David are in Palestine doing who knows what and Nefret is continuing her study of medicine. With the children grown, Amelia and Emerson can finally be alone! Not so fast- M. Maspero has a job for the Peabody-Emersons: go to Amarna and find out what on earth is happening with Herr Morgenstern, who is supposed to be excavating the site, but has been behaving erratically. The Peabody-Emersons discover Herr Morgenstern's behavior is linked to a bust of Queen Nefertiti or should I say busts? There are several floating around but only one is genuine and different parties are after it with their own agenda. Another exciting adventure for Amelia and co. Unlike everyone else, this book isn't the end of the road for me because I am reading on chronological order in which the stories take place. I needed to know what happened next after the shocking ending of the previous installment. This one picks up the threads but all was not resolved entirely to my satisfaction. I need to read on I suppose! The plot is fast paced with danger lurking around every corner and Sethos not far behind. The narrative sticks with Amelia's point-of-view for most of the book when a few fragments of \"Manuscript H\" work their way in to show what is happening with Ramses and David. Their plot was far more interesting than the wildly improbable assassination attempts by bungling idiots. From their names to the ridiculous ways they were vanquished was all to coincidental and smacked of a silly novel by the likes of Miss Smith. I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to know who and what was going on. The ending was too abrupt and anticlimactic for me. I was left feeling a bit lost and confused as to how the two stories come together. I guessed the identities of the villains just before Amelia did. The story also contains the age old debate between Amelia's firm belief in Christian doctrine and Emerson's atheism. I love the way Amelia and Emerson concluded the debate. Amelia, thankfully, refrains from Victorian moralizing in this book. On the negative side, the reader almost has to be aware of the political situation at that time or some of the undercurrents in the plot don't make sense. I just adore Amelia and Emerson. They're one of my favorite literary couples. Even after so many years of marriage and all they've been through, they're still deeply in love. Emerson even manages to say so, in his own special way. I loved every scene they were in alone and how they're still a healthy married couple despite everything else that is going on. They made me chuckle a lot.Ramses has the best traits of his parents but is his own independent man. Despite me not liking him as an adult, I found myself missing him when he took so long to enter the story. I was disappointed there wasn't more from his point-of-view, especially earlier in the story. Nefret is as sweet and loving as ever, but with a new soberness from her experiences. None of the story is from her point-of-view and I was frustrated because I wondered what was going on inside her head. David is a real action hero. Lia will be pleased when he returns home to relate his adventures. I was surprised she didn't insist on joining him. Sethos manages to be very enjoyable despite who he is. We get to see a new side of him here when Ramses tries to outmaneuver a master.There are several new characters here. Herr Morgenstern is the most important. He is a noted archeologist who has been behaving erratically. The mystery is why and what happened to Nefertiti? He comes across as naive at times and at other times possessed by something or even cursed. Herr M provides a lot of chuckles here. There's also Mr. Buddle, a mysterious man who acts for the financial backer of the excavation. I didn't really care for him much. He was a bit pompous and stupid. Herr von Raubritter is another mysterious man claiming to be an archeologist but doesn't seem to know the first thing about excavating. He isn't in the story long enough to get an idea of his personality. He seems like he could be a villain but is he? Mr. Dullard is a hairy missionary with a voice that doesn't match his figure. Like Emerson, I didn't trust him at first but then I grew to like him. I was surprised by the outcome of his plot. Finally, there's Miss Ermentrude DeVere Smith, a writer of silly romance novels (the kind Amelia secretly enjoys). Like Emerson I have little use for made up, silly, affected women and Miss Smith is no exception. Amelia is too kind to Miss Smith. There is ONE more new character introduced at the end. I found him enjoyable and amusing- a fresh and youthful charm to keep the novel's tone light. I didn't notice a whole lot of difference in the writing so overall, great job to Joan Hess for taking on the daunting task of finishing another author's work. I'm sure her friend Barbara is smiling on from the Egyptian afterlife.I did notice some anachronisms and American speech patterns pop up once in awhile. I didn't question the word choices too much but high sticklers beware. For those who haven't read any of the other books in the series, Amelia recaps past adventures but I wouldn't recommend starting with this one."}, {"userName": "Craig Monson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4578470-craig-monson", "userReview": "Probably not the best book for a first encounter with Amelia Peabody: 1/3 Elizabeth Peters and 2/3 Joan Hess, apparently.

Thanks to the gracious folks who responded to my request at William Morrow/Harper Collins Publishers, I was able to get my hands on this advance reader's edition, and you may be sure that I devoured it!For those who may be coming to this book with no prior knowledge of the series, even though this book is #20, it fits chronologically about two-thirds of the way into the series and fills in a gap between previously published books. The Painted Queen will certainly be most meaningful to you if you have read the books that precede it, but I think it would stand up even if you came to it without that context.That being said, here are my thoughts:This is a stellar addition to the Amelia series. On page one, I admitted to myself some reservations. Joan Hess is the co-author for this work; I wondered, how would the collaboration flow? Would I really recognize my favorite characters? Would I be able to suspend disbelief and go along on their adventures with the same thrill I've gotten in many of Elizabeth Peters' other works?I realized by about page seven that the answer to all of those questions was YES! In fact, this book may actually mark the series' peak of comedy, derring-do, and suspense. It's very, very funny, and the action is tightly plotted without any slow bits.I love the premise, which is absurd and therefore sits fair and square in Amelia's world. Without any apology whatsoever, she OWNS the fact that her life is straight out of the most sensational of novels. She and her family of archaeologists are just beginning their latest venture in Egypt when a villain with a monocle bursts into her bath chamber, gasps \"Murder!\" and collapses in a dead heap on the floor moments before he would have strangled her. Naturally, she hoists herself out of the tub and begins going through his pockets. When she and her husband Emerson begin speculating about the presence of the monocle, she immediately informs him that it must be the insignia of a secret society, and that assassins sometimes travel in gangs.\"Assassins do not travel in gangs,\" says Emerson.(They are the perfect duo!)This is the point at which I began to dissolve into fits of chuckling.And that is just the beginning of an adventure that involves a whole parade of monocled men named after the great traitors of history. Also, you know the iconic treasure sitting in a museum in Berlin, the Nefertiti bust? The Emerson family is seamlessly inserted into that historical narrative. (I love the way Elizabeth Peters has always had them at or near the scene of great discoveries, but always in such a way that real history is left intact...they get their hands all over the story, but in the end they leave no trace!)So, yes, the Nefertiti bust has been discovered, but then it vanishes, but then it reappears again...and again...and again...how many of them can there be? Amelia's son Ramses and his best friend David traverse Cairo hunting down each new copy.This keeps Ramses mostly away from Nefret, the Emerson family's ward, now a grown woman with a tragedy in her past. Readers of The Falcon at the Portal and He Shall Thunder in the Sky know that since this new book is filling in that chronological gap, the relationship tension must be kept intact. It simmers ever so slightly below the surface.I must mention one other big thing that I adored in this book....the appearances of the Emerson family's perpetual nemesis (actually, at this point, \"frenemy\" is probably a more accurate description). Yes, it's Sethos, or as Amelia likes to call him, the Master Criminal. His disguises and plots are ongoing joys of the series. When he shows up in The Painted Queen, it's with greater panache than ever before. There are thundering hooves. There are dramatic interventions. It's glorious. Those who know the rest of his story will revel in these moments.So, in review, this book is everything I wanted the last Amelia Peabody novel to be. I'm sad that there won't be any more of her adventures, but I'm happy that The Painted Queen is such a fitting swan song. I am totally elated to have read it, and you will be too.

I've been reading reader reviews, and many mention characters and plot discrepancies, but I'm not that close a reader (and have a limited memory for plots) so I simply sat back and enjoyed being in their company again, with the marvelous Barbara Rosenblat narrating this 20th entry (and all the others) in the series. Lots of details--historical, character, archaeological--slow the plot a bit, though it moves at a steady pace, more urgently at time; series characters--Amelia, Emerson, Ramses, Nefret, Sethos--are a big draw and there are secondary characters who re-appear with much of the humor from the secondary characters and their quirks (for example, there are 5 aptly-named assassins out to get Amelia and they die in ways tied to their names: Guy (as in Fawkes) from an explosion, Absalom (King David's rebellious son) caught in a tree, for example; multiple, twisty plot lines involving primarily a newly discovered bust of Nefertiti (the famous one in Berlin) and the myriad forgeries that appear to complicate the mystery; language features witty repartee, descriptions, authentic stylistic variants and vocabulary; and the tone is amusing, dramatic, frankly melodramatic, and playful. Peters was scrupulous about her Egyptian history and archaeological details, and those remain one of the pleasures of the book. I don't expect any more titles discovered in Peters' attic, more's the pity. The only way to fill the void left by Peters' death in 2013 is to go back to the first and listen to all of them again. Crocodile on the Sandbank, the first title, is set in Amarna, and Painted Queen brings us back there, full circle. A vastly entertaining series--mystery, adventure, history, clever writing, and a touch of romance."}, {"userName": "Angela Jett", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56792237-angela-jett", "userReview": "Sorely missed Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody novels. I was extremely saddened when Barbara Mertz passed away... Joan Hess did a great job completing this novel. Now I need to go back and re-read prior novels to compare the styles. I almost want to say that Joan's version better describes the interactions and relationships of the main characters (and the cursing). But that could be my memory playing with me. Regardless, she does Amelia, Ramses, Nefret, and Emerson justice! Oh, and Sethos too. Quite enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/572977-kate", "userReview": "It is impossible to settle on a rating for this loving completion of Peters' last book. Bits are magnificent, capturing all the right voices. It's a tricky time period for the characters - after Nefret's disasterous marriage, before the resolution of the love story, before the reform of Sethos, as the First World War appears on the horizon - and the ludicrous (wonderful!) plot makes it all the more difficult. At times it reads like a pastiche, at times like an exaggeration, at times like Peters herself and at times like she sounded when she was making fun of her own style. The characters do not have their usual depth, but then, they weren't so deep in the earlier novels as they became later. But Amarna! Nefertiti! Crazy tours of Cairo! Farce! It was nice to visit with the Peabody Emersons, whether they seem themselves or not."}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7001837-marlene", "userReview": "Originally published at Reading RealityThe Amelia Peabody series is for those who like their historical mysteries steeped in calamity, where their heroine frequently jumps out of the frying pan, into the fire, leaps from that small cooking fire to a large bonfire, from thence to a major conflagration, and finally into the cauldron of an active volcano. All told in the singular voice of an intelligent woman who is always utterly certain that she is both right and the best person to deal with whatever crisis has just erupted.Amelia Peabody and her Egyptologist husband Radcliffe Emerson are the creations of the late, great Elizabeth Peters, herself an archaeologist under her \u201creal name\u201d of Barbara Mertz. Ms. Peters is no longer with us, but she left behind one final semi-completed manuscript in her hallmark series featuring the redoubtable, indefatigable, Amelia Peabody. That manuscript is, of course, the book under discussion, The Painted Queen, completed by mystery author Joan Hess.If any of the above, or what follows, sounds like your cup of tea, do not, I beg you, start with The Painted Queen. It is the end of a saga that has been going on for over 40 years. Begin with Crocodile on the Sandbank, the first book in this long-running story, where Amelia and Emerson meet and solve their first murder together. It is fun, hilarious and occasionally creepy, all at the same time. It also sets the pattern, as their long-time reis (dig foreman) puts it early on, \u201cAnother dead body. Every year it is the same. Every year, another dead body\u2026\u201d Or two, or three, or even half a dozen, as it is in The Painted Queen.The action in The Painted Queen takes place in the 1912-1913 dig season in Egypt, putting it squarely into the middle of Amelia\u2019s long and fascinating tale. While the parts of the story, and the string of murders, that revolve around her family are a direct followup to the events of A River in the Sky, the historical events are centered around the 1912 discovery of Nefertiti\u2019s bust at Amarna.As usual, Amelia is in everything pretty much up to her neck. Equally as usual, while she (and her son Ramses) are sought by assassins at every turn, she puts herself in the most danger by her tendency to act before she thinks \u2013 a tactic that for once her enemies are too disorganized to take advantage of.In the end, as always, Amelia Peabody, with the help of her friends and family, and with more than a bit of assistance from divine providence, solves the mystery and keeps her family safe, if only so that they can return the following season for yet another body, and another mystery to solve.Escape Rating B: It was great to have one last visit with these old and very dear friends. As a mystery, not all of it hangs together, and much of what makes the story work relies on the reader knowing who all these people are and how they relate to Amelia and her life, but for those of us who have read from the beginning, this coda is a treat.There are, as was often the case in Amelia\u2019s history, two stories going on. One involves both the history of early 20th century Egypt and early 20th century Egyptian archaeological history. As this story takes place in 1912, events are also part of the run up to World War I and the beginning of the end for both the British and the Ottoman empires. At the same time, the finding of Nefertiti\u2019s bust was a real historical event, an event at which the Emersons were not present, so their involvement in the mess has to be tidied over by the author before the end, so that history can proceed on the course we know that it did.The more personal side of the story, that of the assassins who are chasing after Amelia and Ramses for their part in the death of Amelia\u2019s ward Nefret\u2019s unfortunate and totally scurrilous husband actually serves as comic relief, as the personal adventures of the family often do. The assassins are completely inept from beginning to end. Clearly Nefret\u2019s late unlamented was the brains of the outfit.Whether a reader falls in love with this series tends to ride on whether or not said reader loves or hates Amelia\u2019s voice. The story is told from her first person perspective in her very distinctive style. We know what she knows, we know what she thinks she knows (which can be vastly different from the actual solution, at least in the early stages of each mystery) and she can be rather sure of herself and her rightness even when she is fairly far off the beam. We also hear her inner thoughts, which can often be scathing as well as funny.She\u2019s someone I would love to have tea with (or something stronger) but would not want to be related to except at some remove. She generally gets her way, one way or another. And she so often IS right, and not chary of reminded people of that fact. She\u2019s a treasure as a fictional character, but would be a dratted nuisance in real life.I\u2019m going to miss her."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1545867-robin", "userReview": "Hmmmm.What did I think.Okay, here's what I think I thought: I enjoyed the book. This was an unfinished Amelia Peabody that Elizabeth Peters' estate gave to Joan Hess, a friend of hers, to finish. Fortunately, according to Ms. Hess, the plot and notes already existed.Except for knowing that the book was completed by someone else, it was a nice read and a familiar story. This one seems a little more prat-fally, and a little like Thursday Next is somewhere in the background being stalked by the Minotaur. There's a lot of really weird things that happen in this book, is the point I'm trying to make. And they're not exactly out of place, they're just also not exactly things that might happen to the Emerson clan. You already know this, but I'll say it for the new people: while this is the last book, this is not the last book choronologically. As you are no doubt aware, Reader, the books were not published in chronological order. This one continues that confusing tradition. It falls somewhere after (spoilers, btw, if you haven't read the rest) Nefret's first husband dies and before she remarries. The Nefret story seems oddly unfinished, but that may well be because her story was not concluded at the time of Peters' death. While she's still an important character, it seems like several times she just appeared from nowhere to have a short speaking part, then disappeared again (maybe to help Thursday with the Minotaur, I don't know. I just know that she spends a lot of time staring pensively off into space, acting as if she remembers something, then departing the room. We never find out why.)There were a few places where the dialog was repetitive, as in, nearly exactly the same paragraph twice in a row. I'm unclear whether this was the result of the book being partially written, or if I just don't know enough about Ms. Hess's style.If you've read them all, you won't regret reading this one.I mean, you will, but it's because it's the last one we'll ever get.

This book deals with the discovery of the bust of one of Egypt's most famous Queens, Nefertiti! It is the Winter Season of 1912 - 1913. Prior to leaving Cairo for their excavation site in Amarna, Amelia is attacked by an assassin while taking a bath. Amelia and Emerson head to Amarna as they puzzle thru who the assassin was. Dodging more assassins, would be thieves and the strange happenings at the dig site, it is the start of another ordinary dig season for the famous and infamous couple. This is a MUST READ SERIES for anyone who enjoys archaeology, especially Egyptian, an engrossing plot line that extends from the first book to this last one. The characters are lovable, wacky and will have you laughing at the things they get into. Each book has multiple plots that gradually merge into one as you keep turning the pages, unable to stop. Absolutely one of my very favorite authors and series. I have impatiently awaited each new book and devoured them non-stop. This is the 20th and final book in the series as Elizabeth Peters died before filling in all the details but her close friend and fellow author, Joan Hess finished the final draft before her own recent death. Elizabeth was actually Barbara Mertz, an acclaimed Egyptian scholar and author with a Ph. D in the subject.

I am only surprised by the omission of the marvelous narrator, Barbara Rosenblat who has enraptured audiobook listeners including myself. Rosenblat portrays the characters consistently and skillfully throughout each volume including this final one. Indeed, in my experience the combination of author's words and narrator's voice truly brought the characters to life in a very special way. I can't imagine one without the other.
