With all her friend\u2019s help, she creates delectable desserts to rescue her customers from things like a bad breakup, loss of a job, and anything else you can imagine. In this story, she has been asked to bake up motivational treats for a group of artists with different talents at a local retreat. After she delivers the goodies she goes to tell the owner and finds her dead on the floor with all the artists standing nearby. The police immediately suspect foul play and Winnie has a dessert connection with all the viable suspects which lands her right in the middle of another murder investigation.The author has created a very unique theme for this series. After the expenses of having a bakery in a storefront became beyond what Winnie could afford she started a home-based business and uses an old ambulance she inherited to deliver her desserts to her customers. The treats even arrive on a stretcher complete with icing IV\u2019s. She also inherited a cat that goes along for each delivery.The characters are all very well developed. Most of Winnie\u2019s friends are senior citizens and she has a real bond with them. They along with her best friend Renee are her taste testers and her confidants. Renee is also Winnie\u2019s only employee. Her romantic relationship with a local college professor, who she met when making a delivery to him, is a little murky. His teenage daughter does not like her father giving anyone else attention and she has done everything she can to break them up.I thought solving the murder this time would be easy as we knew from the start there were only five suspects, but it turned out to be very complex. None were very forthcoming and all appeared to be hiding something. Winnie didn\u2019t give up though and I really enjoyed following each little hint and clue right along with her.The clever theme of this series, interesting characters, and a very imaginative plot kept this reader very entertained. All the dessert talk and descriptions made my mouth water.

There is something really special in the relationships that Laura writes and the importance she assigns her characters. I love that her characters are not all in their 30's. I appreciate that those who are \"north of 75\", play a major role not only in the book but in the day to day lives of the characters. While I find the idea of the dessert squad fun, I love the cozy even more for the relationships than the desserts, which is saying a lot as the desserts are very smart and sound fantastic. It is wonderful to see that life goes on and evolves for everyone and that the curious mind doesn't rest and is valuable at any age. This one is out January 2nd and has moments that make you laugh and make you want to cry a happy tear or two.

Her latest order, a plate of motivational desserts for an artists\u2019 retreat, is just what she needs to keep her mind off her own relationship woes.But Winnie\u2019s problems seem like trifles when she discovers the body of retreat owner Sally Dearfield mere inches away from five oh-so-eccentric and viable suspects. Now, this baking detective must uncover the inspiration behind Sally\u2019s murder before another creative genius is iced.Review:Winnie Johnson is a fabulous protagonist! I love her and her friends. Now that her Emergency Dessert Squad business is taking off she is very busy. Silver Lake, Ohio has taken a liking to her baking and her emergency desserts. She is asked to deliver some very specific desserts to an artist retreat. The gang think up a special one for each talent the participants have. What fun to be in on the banter they have thinking up great names. I love that this series is not just the normal aged group of friends. Bridget and Mr. Nelson are the best. I do have one complaint and it is very selfish. How does Winnie not see just how wonderful Greg, aka Master Sergeant Hottie is?? Hey that is just me though.After all the wonderful work Winnie and her assistant Renee do on the desserts, of course they stumble upon a body. Not sure if it is an accident or murder, Winnie knows she has to find the answers. Along the way she also is worried about her own love life, keeping her business running and trying to make friends with Lovey, the cat bequeathed to her that likes everyone but Winnie. And Renee seems to have become infatuated with one of the artists, who could possibly be a killer.Author Laura Bradford has a way of writing her characters so they grab you and you want to be friends with them. They come alive on the pages. Their interactions are interesting, lively and always grab my attention. This is the third installment in the wonderful Emergency Dessert Squad Mystery series. Each book is better and better and the first one was great. No matter what Bradford writes I know I am going to love it. Dial M for Mousse is no exception. I loved it from start to finish. Even the talents of the artists was a hoot. I mean a Mime, lol. Her writing style just pulls the reader in and never lets go. The characters are believable and loveable. You cannot get much better than one of her books.Even though this is the third installment, you can read it as a stand-alone, but I would read all of them just for the simple fact that they are wonderful. Winnie is the type of character that is real, warts and all (no I don\u2019t think she has any, but you know). The mystery is well written and full of intrigue and a few red herrings to keep you guessing. I love the reveal and was not sure until I read it. The pace is perfect, the detail not overbearing (I have a problem with too much) and the story is everything you could hope for in a cozy. I only wish I could give more than 5 stars. Laura Bradford has written another stellar read.*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Stormi (Books, Movies, Reviews.

I would list them but I have forgotten them, I know there is a writer, a mime and a magician, just can\u2019t remember the other ones. \ud83d\ude41When her and her friend Rene deliver the deserts they get there and find the group standing over the dead body of the Sally Dearfield, the lady who ordered the desserts. They all swear they had nothing to do with it but the more Winnie thinks about it the more it bothers her as she remembers how they all gasped at the same time when Winnie and her friend came in so she thinks they did it on purpose for their benefit. Winnie just can\u2019t stand it when there is a murder that involves her deserts so she starts snooping around. It seems good ole Sally seemed to have a lot of information on each of the retreaters and so it really could have been any of them if not a group effort.Besides trying to solve a murder Winnie is fretting over what is happening with her and Jay. Caroline\u2019s mother decided all of a sudden that she wants to see her daughter so Jay takes her to see her. He never seemed to have time to talk when he was gone and was always with his ex-wife making her think horrible things. Then when they do try and make a day of things when he gets back he brings Caroline and she tries to make things sound like Jay and her mother were getting back together which is not the truth. Winnie is feeling that maybe things won\u2019t work since his daughter really doesn\u2019t like her, but Jay isn\u2019t giving up. Poor Winnie, I know she likes him but I think she would be better with \u201cMaster Sergeant Hottie\u201d Greg. Don\u2019t you love his nickname that everyone has giving him. He is really sweet too, but she just likes him as a friend, bummer.I think my favorites in this series are still the two senior friends of Winnies. I have seen a trend it seems in putting feisty old folk in cozies and I like it\u2026lol. Probably because they always remind me of my grandparents how have passed on.Overall, this was another fun addition to the series and I really thought the mystery was pretty good although I figured it out.

This is the first book I\u2019ve read in this series; however, the author provided sufficient character background and I easily understood their backgrounds and relationships, and didn\u2019t feel lost jumping in this far into the series. There\u2019s a nice mix of age groups in this book, an intriguing mystery, humor, a touch of romance, and the importance of friendships is prevalent. The mystery was well plotted and has enough viable suspects, and twists and turns, to make it difficult to figure out who the killer was. Winnie Johnson is the owner of the Emergency Dessert Squad in Silver Lake, Ohio. She loves running the Emergency Dessert Squad, creating delightful desserts for people, and coming up with clever and funny names for the desserts with her assistant and best friend, Renee, and her elderly neighbors and friends. Winnie and her inherited cat, Lovey, deliver her desserts in an old ambulance, with a gurney and emergency kit including an IV usually filled with frosting. Sally Dearfield, the owner of a recently opened artists\u2019 retreat, orders Winnie\u2019s decadent desserts for the five artists who are currently staying at Silver Lake Artists\u2019 Retreat. Even though a meeting is being held, Sally instructed Winnie to leave the special desserts in the recipients\u2019 cabins. As they are leaving, Winnie and Renee decide to stop at the main building and are shocked when they find Sally, dead on the floor, surrounded by the five artists. The death is ruled suspicious and Winnie and her trusty sidekicks decide to help the local authorities identify the murderer.

The puns entertained me while the plot kept me speculating on \u2018whodunnit\u2019, and the characters warmed my heart. Protagonist, Winnie Johnson, is an extremely likeable young woman with a heart of gold. I so enjoy her close relationship with her elderly neighbors and how she is involved in their lives on a daily basis. They, in turn, are eager to help her out when she and her best friend, Renee, stumble across the body of the woman who hired them to provide desserts for five artists. Winnie\u2019s business, Emergency Dessert Squad, is one of the cleverest business ideas I\u2019ve come across. Winnie creates custom desserts and delivers them in a vintage ambulance that she inherited from an elderly neighbor (along with a cantankerous cat that does not like her new owner). What makes it even better are the super fun names Winnie creates for her desserts: Your Jokes Make Me Snicker-doodle Cookies; Apple Kootchy-Kootchy-Koo Kuchen; You\u2019re A Peach Pie, to name a few. Ms. Bradford packs the story with so many clever scenes such as Winnie having a \u201cconversation\u201d with a mime and gives such vivid descriptions that you feel like you\u2019re living the moment. Winnie\u2019s budding relationship with single dad, Jay, might be hitting a snag when his teenaged daughter tries to drive a wedge between them. Can Winnie find a way to win over both the surly teen and her cat while finding a killer?

I love the concept of this series - Winnie uses an ambulance to deliver her desserts - and the names she comes up with for desserts (for example Your Jokes Make Me Snickerdoodle cookies - there are a couple of recipes in the back of the book). I also love the relationship Winnie has with those she cares about \u2013 Renee, Mr. Nelson (who is always Mr. Nelson to Winnie), Bridget, Greg - even her cat Lovey (their relationship alone offers more than a few giggles). Even Winnie\u2019s relationship with Jay and his teenage daughter adds to the book rather than detract from it (all too often relationships can get in the way of the mystery in a cozy mystery but not in this series). As for the mystery, I found it to be the weakest part of the book - not something I say often about a Laura Bradford mystery. Five suspects is just the right amount but I felt that only a couple of the suspects were well-developed while some were not developed at all and barely registered me.

The business has a competitive and creative edge over traditional bakeries. A fact that has Sally Dearfield, the owner of an artists' retreat, soliciting Winnie for her decadent desserts. Upon delivery of the treats designed, named, and prepared individually for each artist, Winnie and Renee find themselves going to the main building. What they find is shocking and upsetting - Sally Dearfield is dead on the floor surrounded by each of the individual artists to whom they just hand delivered desserts, and the death is ruled suspicious. Winnie and her trusty sidekicks decide to \"help\" the local police identify the murderer before anyone else is murdered. Throughout the novel we also get a glimpse into Winnie's complicated love life. As Winnie is trying to solve the mystery behind Sally's death, the threads of her relationship with Jay are woven within. He and his daughter are away and the circumstances make Winnie question everything she thought they had together. When he returns, Winnie isn't sure what to expect, and that has her tied up in knots.One of the ideas behind Dial M for Mousse that I found interesting was that none of the suspects had anything to do with the main characters in the book. In most cozies I've read lately, the heroine, one of her family members, or some of her friends end up being suspects. I enjoyed the deviation from the same ole - same ole. Winnie's compassion, caring, and friendship with the elders in her neighborhood is a wonderful aspect to the Emergency Dessert Squad Mystery series.The author did a great job keeping the suspect protected from identification by the readers. I really didn't have any idea which of the five artists it could have been. All of them had secrets that could have ignited to the point that killing Sally was their final option. Dial M for Mousse was fun, fast-paced, and enjoyable to read.The characters are well-developed and the author continues the development throughout the book. Winnie's interactions with all of her friends is filled with nothing but kindness and compassion. Winnie's relationship status in the book isn't smooth and the author does a great job writing the issues realistically and without either character looking bad.

She also loves her naming sessions with her best friend Renee and all of her elderly neighbors and friends. Some of the dessert names that they come up with are so clever and funny.

The writing style flows smoothly,the pace moves along at a great speed and the book is an easy read.The mystery was well plotted and kept me guessing until the end.

There's a teenage girl who stubbornly insists on being the only one who's happy, and then there are Winnie's two elderly friends who take turns getting their emotional noses out of joint. The highlight of all this angst is that Winnie gets to say (and to hear) words that each and every one of us on this planet needs. One of the things that makes Winnie such a strong character is her big heart and her love for her friends, and that's the main focus of Dial M for Mousse.Speaking of Winnie's friends, I can see some readers being upset with the character of Mr. Nelson, a man in his late seventies who loves the sight of a woman's cleavage. He seldom misses the weather report because of the statuesque weather girl, and he has various prime viewing spots on his porch and in his apartment so that he can indulge his hobby. Having had my own cleavage stared at ever since I had one, I have to admit that this can be a tiny bit tiresome, but never once is Mr. Nelson any sort of threat. The man keeps his hands to himself, and he never makes an inappropriate comment. In fact, he'd be the first person to take his cane to someone who did. Mr. Nelson is definitely one of Winnie's most beloved friends, and I enjoy seeing what he gets up to in each book.Now...if only the focus had remained on the mystery more! I really enjoyed deducing why the woman was killed and which one of the five did the deed. Not only that, but there's an added gem in each of the Emergency Dessert Squad mysteries: the names Winnie gives her delectable confections.

I like the characters in this series. Winnie seems the perfect amateur sleuth. Her friends and co-workers all mix together well. I love the two seniors in the book. They are eccentric yet very loveable. Good fast book to read."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6032312-kimberly", "userReview": "*A Thank you to NetGalley, the publisher and author for providing me with a copy of this book for a unbiased review*Hello Fellow Readers,I love reading Cozy mysteries, as you all know but while the story was fun (despite that they are trying to solve the murder, murder is not fun) I couldn't get past the reason why the MC was trying to solve the mystery. The reason they gave didn't make sense. I also wish I knew this was the third book in the series since there were some established relationships I had a hard time connecting with. The investigation itself was more in the background than I would have liked. I did enjoy the puns of each dessert and I give Bradford so much credit for it. Plus, I really love the recipes that are included and can hopefully bake something soon."}, {"userName": "Deborah Almada", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42152964-deborah-almada", "userReview": "I like this series a lot, I like the premise, I love the characters and all the puny rescue names for the desserts, and usually the mystery if pretty interesting. All the things I love about this series was present in this book except I think that the mystery was way in the background in this book. I do love the character development that took place in the story, and hope that all this back and forth with Caroline, Jay's daughter, will now fade into the background at bit,but I think the mystery suffered for it and was often just an after thought. This did not stop me from enjoying this book, but I hope the mystery is a little more featured in the next book in the series!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Melissa Castor", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25410032-melissa-castor", "userReview": "When an artists retreat comes to town, the owner asks Winnie to make desserts for all five artists.

The relationships were many and by reading the previous stories it might be a little easier to figure out Winnie and Jay's romance and his daughter Caroline's dislike of Winnie. Mr. Nelson and Renee are part of the crew that help Winnie solve the murders. When Winnie is delivering special desserts to a group of performers at a local retreat she walks in to find the owner dead by poisoning. Blackmail is the center of this crime book. Some yummy recipes are also included. The mystery is good and clues are plentiful."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37129488-karen", "userReview": "This series has a unique premise, an emergency dessert delivery service!I wish that really existed!I find the characters engaging and really enjoy the intergenerational friendship between Winnie and her neighbours.The whodunit story was interesting and kept me guessing. Just when I thought I had it figured out, I was wrong!My only complaint is the storyline involving Winnie's love interest Jay and his daughter Caroline. If that storyline and those two characters were removed, I would have given this book 5 stars.I voluntarily reviewed an advance reader copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Kayt18", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2989001-kayt18", "userReview": "\"Dial M for Mousse\" is another fabulous read by Laura Bradford. Her characters are believable and well developed. I know when I crack open a book by this wonderful author I am going to be entertained from page one to the very end. I was not disappointed. Winnie is such a wonderful protagonist, Mr. Nelson is a hoot, Bridget is intelligent, I love all of them. There is no lull in action, no over reacting. It is fun and intrigue from the very start. You can read this one as a stand-alone but why do that. This series is a hoot, it is just the right mix of mystery and fun. You can never go wrong with anything Laura Bradford writes. \"Dial M for Mousse\" is another fine example of this. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21737889-linda", "userReview": "Dial M for Mousse is the third book in Laura Bradford's Emergency Dessert Mystery series.
