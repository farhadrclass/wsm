Unfortunately, not before Alex and Robin's house is burnt down in retaliation. At least they find a dog that they adopt at their temporary home. So my question is- why does the doctor continue to see patients in his home? Because of his involvement in sensitive cases, often with fragile or temperamental people, I would think he should rent an office for he has plenty of money. But then the author couldn't wax poetic about the beauty of the doctor's home, his elaborate meals and his koi pond."}, {"userName": "Gwen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39965491-gwen", "userReview": "My feelings are mixed about this one. I liked the introduction and characterization of the French bull dog, Spike. Kellerman is either a true dog person, or his research was thorough. Spike\u2019s actions at the end were implausible, probably physically impossible, but the reader doesn\u2019t mind. It would be nice if a dog of that size and build could have done what he did, so suspension of disbelief is set aside in favor of willing the dog success.I liked the descriptions of the tape. They lend tension and an overall eerie tone to the entire piece. Very frightening.I liked the occasional humor. In fact, I think that, of all the books in this series, this one has the most appealing dialogue between good friends Detective Sturgis and Dr. Delaware. When Sturgis is fingerprinting Delaware and asks him a question, Delaware responds with \u201cI\u2019m not saying a word without my lawyer, pig.\u201d When Spike comes between Delaware and his on-and-off-again squeeze, Robin, Milo comments, \u201cOedipus Rover.\u201dI didn\u2019t like the uptight character given Dr. Delaware in this one. His sanctimony in previous books was a turn off but acceptable in a character brimming with confidence and chutzpah. Turning him into a whiny, jump-at-shadows wimp may have been an attempt to humanize the protagonist. If so, it backfired, merely making him contemptible and, on occasion, annoying.I didn\u2019t like the use of two disparate storylines for the purpose of misdirects, shades of Blood Test. Parallel storylines work in Kellerman\u2019s books only when the two plots are interrelated. When they don\u2019t have anything to do with each other, the minor plot feels obstructionistic, more like one is being used to pad the work. It gets in the way of the real story and is wasted reading.More wasted reading was the detail invested on the homeless camp. This is my second time reading this book, and I skipped dozens of pages addressing the plight of the homeless in the Los Angeles area. I got the sense I had stepped out of a novel and into an advocate\u2019s cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Admittedly, homelessness is an issue worth tackling, but it didn\u2019t advance the story, not one iota, and should have been filed for a future novel emphasizing homelessness.Kellerman had to work hard to weave all his loose threads together in this one, and I didn\u2019t find the ending convincing. I think sometimes he falls in love with characterization and setting and, at the eleventh hour, has to force himself to consider plot. If I re-read this one again, it will be selectively, revisiting only the parts I liked."}, {"userName": "J", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1191925-j", "userReview": "I NEITHER HIDE, NOR FEED, MY REVIEWS. THEY MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.This is my second Kellerman novel. I' m really liking his work!I love the device of seeing criminal investigation through the eyes of a child psychologist, Alex Delaware. All the criminal forensics are there, but the crimes at times are secondary to Delaware's puzzling through the relationships and motivations from which the crimes arise.It's nice that Delaware is well-adjusted -- handsome and educated, but with a reasonable ego as he's aware of his frailties and limitations. In the sense that Alex has a lot of feminine \"yang,\" his good friend, police detective Milo Sturgis provides some \"yin.\" However, Alex is plenty yin, too, evidenced by his awesome, supportive girlfriend, Robin, who would never go for a jerk. Delaware is now in private practice, but does a certain amount of consulting with the justice system, evaluating child custody situations, etc., which is his nexus to crime.In this book, \"bad love\" has two meanings. At the first level, it refers to a certain celebrity child counselor's view that bad parenting is \"bad love.\" Turns out the celebrity (deceased now for eight or so years) had a hidden meaning for the phrase, too. In the celebrity's private \"corrective\" residential school for disturbed children back in the '60s or '70s, he mistreated his charges, some of whom were not even disturbed per se, but dealing problems such as bed-wetting, dyslexia, absentee parents or domineering parents. The counselor gave secretive one-on-one sessions in which he emotionally abused the kids.To the public, this counselor, Dr. de Bosch (called \"Dr. Botch\" by one of his alumni) is a paragon of virtue, giving lectures and writing magazine columns on how to rear children, never disclosing his closeted abuse. To his alumni, he embodies evil. No wonder that when his \"graduates\" reach adulthood, some are very damaged -- one to the point that he undertakes to kill all the school's former faculty and key supporters. The sicko considers Delaware -- who never worked for de Bosch, and in fact thinks his theories are superficial and heavily borrowed -- to be part of the de Bosch travesty simply because Delaware, early in his career, was forced by a hospital supervisor to organize a psych conference that pretty much deified De Bosch.Th words \"bad love\" are also a clue that the perp leaves at some of the murder scenes. Alex is the one to figure out what the phrase refers to. He identifies the pattern in several seemingly unrelated deaths leading to the hurting, disgruntled former student of DeBosch's school of terror.Of course Alex does have an incentive to figure it all out -- he starts receiving cryptic threats (in writing and in the form of serious property damage), from which he concludes he's on the killer's hit list.There's a subordinate plot that offers relief from the grimness of the de Bosch saga -- Alex finds a stray French bulldog, to which he and Robin become attached as they searh for its owner. When the owner finally shows up (the middle-aged daughter of the actual owner, who recently died of natural causes), she sees the dog is well cared for, and invites Alex plus Robin to keep \"Spike.\" (The daughter's hubby is allergic to dogs).They enthusiastically accept.Book is way more complex than I've described. Many wonderful, clever touches and insights. One quibble -- and I felt this, too, with this first Delaware book I read, \"Survival of the Fittest\" -- I don't get why Delaware sees patients at his home address. When a professional is dealing with people who are innately unbalanced, or unhinged by life events, why would he-she want clients or their relatives to know where he lives? It's a point, however, on which I'm willing to suspend my disbelief."}, {"userName": "Kathleen Hagen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1291703-kathleen-hagen", "userReview": "In this one, Alex Delaware receives a tape in the mail with a horrific scream on it, and then a child\u2019s robotic voice repeating: \u201cbad love, bad love, don\u2019t give me that bad love.\u201d Alex is horrified by the tape which comes in a plain envelope with no identifying names, addresses or even fingerprints, but he then remembers that back in 1979 he was involved in a conference which he co-chaired, unwillingly, including in its title, the words \u201cbad love\u201d. It involved the theories of a particular psychologist about children receiving \u201cbad love\u201d and growing up to be criminals. He ferrets out an old program and starts trying to track down the other psychoogists on the program and finds that he either can\u2019t find them, or, in at least one case he initially finds, the man is dead. Additionally, people who are staff in a particular \u201ccorrective school\u201d for children are being murdered horribly. As Alex investigates, he becomes aware that he is one of the only remaining panel members from the \u201cBad Love\u201d conference left alive.

In his efforts to discover who sent the tape and what these words mean, Delaware soon suspects he is being stalked by a psychopath and, with the help of his friend LAPD detective Milo Sturgis, works to discover who it is and why.

I'd have given it five stars except for one plot device that ultimately was all wrong - the tape of screaming that Delaware is sent at the beginning of the book. As the plot knits together chapter by chapter - did I mention how awesome this story is? - I realized by the very exciting, adrenalin drenched, action ending that this beginning is the single wrong note for how this murderer would have begun his contact with the good doctor. However, I think most readers won't care or notice. For me, this is the best of the series, so far (I'm reading the series in order.)I love Jonathan Kellerman. In each book he never shies away from speaking truth, even if the plot or writing sometimes does not quite live up to his ideals. It's usually good enough, but I'm happy to recommend this one as almost perfect. Tolerating child abuse is like spitting into the wind. All of society pays for not doing more about helping people with mental illness or having an ignorance-based education.I want a French Bulldog!"}, {"userName": "Ann Jenelle Rotol", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5911490-ann-jenelle-rotol", "userReview": "I never really am a fan of mystery/thriller novels. But this book, Bad Love is an exception. Because if you add - even a bit - of psychology in it, then, I will love it! LOL. And I must say, that the psychological aspect here is surprisingly great. Though, don't get me wrong. Even those people who don't have a background in psychology will not be at lost. Some of the terms are layman's. And psychology isn't really the focus here, so... XD Anyhow, this is a great read for the mind. Like all mystery novels, this will make you think of who the perpetrator is. I keep thinking and re-thinking of what has happened in the previous chapters to look for clues which can help me know who's the perpetrator. And I got it! Ha! (I'm so great!) I had fun reading it; and it's good exercise for one's deduction skills.

This novel was a typical Johnathan Kellerman novel--suspenseful, great imagery, fast-reading, characters with believability. \"Bad Love\" had plenty of twists and turns that kept me guessing as to who the \"bad love\" killer was. Finding out what \"bad love\" meant made me cringe. \"Doctors\" like De Bosch are never out to actually help anyone--only fatten their wallets. De Bosch had a certain \"cult-y\" feel about him; very nice and charming in public, very real and unkind in private.

It started with a child's voice on a tape, mentioning about \"bad love.\" That sends Alex on a journey all over California, searching for answers, while he works on another deposition for another case, when it gets heated up. We watch when Alex discovers the connection between the symposium and the murders that happened over the years. And then he realized his life is endangered as the last targets, when someone comes after him and Robin. We're on for a wild ride, when they connect the dots in a strange line of \"suspicious deaths\", which it wasn't as it appears.

It is hard to pinpoint which part of this book is good enough except for the adorable dog. In my opinion, the premise is quite ok but the way the story is delivered is a total mess and confusing. Being too descriptive sometimes can kill the readers' mood, and that is what happened to this book. In addition, a total lack of intensity of adrenaline rush effects and a slow-paced storyline made me put away this book for quite a number of times. Furthermore, I think that the characters in this story are poorly developed and the funny thing is, when the real villain is revealed at the end of the book, I was like \"who's he??\".

Others soon follow: disquieting laughter echoing over a phone line that suddenly goes dead, a chilling act of trespass and vandalism. He has become the target of a carefully orchestrated campaign of vague threats and intimidation rapidly building to a crescendo as harassment turns to terror, mischief to madness.
