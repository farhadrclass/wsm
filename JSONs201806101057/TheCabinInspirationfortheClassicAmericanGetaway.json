But the Welsh genes, a cheek away, the kind that love color, drinking, and dancing have made peace with the pictures, because most of them portray tennis rackets, sun hats, berry baskets, and those items are usable, reasonable things for cabin porches. But then, oh my eyes! I would turn another page and a wooden goose with raffia feathers would be resting on a wood floor, beak inside a doorway. Cast iron roosters would be in kitchens for no good reason- they weren't cake pans, bread molds...they were just there, strutting around soffits. In a cabin, every space counts. And it pains me to see all the people who love cabins waste their space, just like it hurts to open a design book for home interiors and see nothing but white floors, ceilings, slipcovers, with a light khaki lampshade thrown in for what someone thinks is naughtiness.  Still, this book had some good things- information on house placement in regards to prevailing winds, and a cabin plan that I loved, called Le Porch. But I can't live in Le Porch forever, I have four children and have not enough Thoreau appreciation."}, {"userName": "Richardwallin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2665654-richardwallin", "userReview": "This book, written hy an architect, describes the four types of cabins; rustic, transformed, traditional, and modern. A cabin must be 1,200 square feet or less to qualify as a cabin. He gives multiple examples of each type of cabin. He shows how cabins have a \"personality\" and each cabin provide a function for the family that uses it. It has made me realize that before building a cabin, one must decide what the cabin should express; what feeling it should hold, and how it should function. It is an inspirational read."}, {"userName": "Kathie H", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/267531-kathie-h", "userReview": "You should just go out & buy this one. I know I'll turn to this book repeatedly just to daydream. Nice source section in the back so you can just order your cabin kit. ;-) The only thing I would ask for is a detailed listing of where the builders got some of the things in the pictures (names of paint colors, where to buy furniture, etc.). This would make a welcome gift to just about anyone."}, {"userName": "Marci Stone", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23078527-marci-stone", "userReview": "I've had this book for years and I enjoy the simplicity of log cabins.
