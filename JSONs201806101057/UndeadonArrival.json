It's not that there are only bad guys in this story, just that every villain is the protagonist of his/her own narrative, a concept very well employed in this novel. The dreary, gray toned world of the narrative helps the reader easily slide into the main character's mindset and again springs from the noir baseboard that supports this entire tale.The key thing I look for in a novel is, how well did it achieve its goals. Part of this is how well did the narrative inform me as a reader of what those goals are. Am I, a foreigner to the land of this story, a reader, able to discern what the narrative wanted to achieve? If so, did the narrative achieve it? In this case, the answer is yes to both questions. The narrative informed me early on by the protagonist's internal thought processes, free unassociated discourse, dialogue, and action, that I was in for a zombie noir story with no happy ending, that it would adhere to the noir tale more than the zombie tale, and that I was reading for entertainment and I shouldn't look too deeply into it for comparisons to high literature or heavy analysis. I should just enjoy the goddamn ride. And enjoy it I did.One of the things that sets zombies apart from most other monsters is that they are capable of being used as setting as well as character, they inform the world and worldview of the other characters and they are not always active in the action. In this narrative, the zombies are almost always part of the setting, the scenery around which the truly important actions take place. They inform the story but almost never play an active role in moving it forward. Hard to do in an era where readers (and viewers) want to watch a heroic character tackle hoards of the undead. This was a pretty daring choice, but it fit exactly within the noir constraints and gave the world an immediacy and a significance that it might otherwise have lacked.Another thing I generally dislike is excessive gore. Grossing me out is not the same thing as scaring me, and trying for the gross-out tells me as a reader that the author has no leg for the story to stand on, so I'm being given some distraction to play with while the machinery of the story moves us forward into the next scene. \"Undead on Arrival\" doesn't bother with gore hardly at all. There's a \"wet sound\" once, and there's plenty of implied gore, but the narrative doesn't dwell on the visuals or offer unnecessary levels of detail. That detail work is left to the reader's imagination, where it should be. And I greatly, greatly appreciated it.Overall, the level of detail was superb. I was able to imagine the characters without too much interference from the author, the narrative gave me enough detail to use my imagination and not so much detail that I didn't have to. That's the perfect sweet spot that so many writers miss. Hitting it meant I got to engage my imagination and make the world of the book come alive for me in a way unique to my own sensibilities. And again, it was appreciated.But mostly, I found the book fun to read. I liked the protagonist of Glen Novak. I cared about him even though he wasn't a hero, and I wanted to root for him. I had a lot of fun reading and playing in the world created by the narrative, and was quite happy to accept that this world existed despite my own expectations of what might happen. The authorial control in creating the world of \"Undead on Arrival\" made me confident that even if it's not the world I would have created, it was a fully conceived world with thought behind it. I didn't have to doubt the narrative's authenticity once.And, lastly, I think the ending was very much earned. Over the course of the book, each step kept me engaged and interested, and when those steps reached their inevitable conclusion, it neither kicked me out of the story nor made me angry. It felt like the right ending."}, {"userName": "Paul Montgomery", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8741556-paul-montgomery", "userReview": "Synopsis: Zombies. Bastards. They're out there again. Taking out most of the population, and forcing a few survivors to hole up in a rough little town. With three power figures, constantly struggling to keep an uneasy peace, there's as much threat internally as there is externally. And of those three, one has just been given a death sentence. With mere hours left before he turns into one of the undead, Novak is determined to find his killer and take his revenge...Robinson handles this nicely. And, by this, I mean everything. The world, the characters, the set-up, the dialogue. True, he does walk a perilously narrow line by making Novak fairly unlikeable at times. However, he handles this well, as Novak is a brutal product of the world he's in - a brutal force of nature.The \"Who killed me?\" mystery is a classic, and can be done very, very well. Thankfully, it's one that I haven't seen too much of, much less seeing it overdone. And setting it in a post-zombie-apocalypse world gives both the story and the genre a nice little twist. It's telling that the zombies themselves don't dominate the story, but instead complement it very nicely.Admittedly, there's a couple of points which niggle - a few too many moments of limb-trembling weakness followed by Novak being perfectly fine for action. Yes, they're explained well, but they still stand out in an otherwise very, very well told story.A couple of other high points for me, personally, are the characters and resolutions. Each is distinct and strong in their own way, rather than generic, blank faces in the backgrounds. Dialogue flows well.And, finally, the ending is very, very good.Well worth a look..."}, {"userName": "Teddy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10647656-teddy", "userReview": "If you check out the description and find yourself interested (which I assume you would be if you're also checking out the reviews!), you MUST read this novel. Undead on Arrival will not let you down- delivering what you demand from a horror novel and serving up so much more.Mr. Robinson's writing juxtaposes stark and vivid, creating a black & white world full of explicit detail and action. He has extracted a tiny portion of the zombie apocalypse aftermath (simplified down to the survivalist, inter-personal, and political struggles of a small, Northern California town called Devon) and then magnified it so we may observe the complex within the obvious.Today is the day Glen Novak dies... and this zombie-noir novel treats us to the violent and oft-times depraved lengths he sinks to in a quest to avenge himself. For him, the world ended five years ago, when a mysterious plague ripped through human society, like the gore-stained hatchet he wields, and disemboweled everything he ever cared about in it. All Novak can do now is survive, until he unknowingly crosses the wrong person and springs a nefarious trap. Now he must find another reason to live for just one more day.In many ways, it seems like the wrestling coach-turned-scavenger Novak is already dead. He's killed off that remaining bit of common humanity in himself in order to survive in an apocalyptic world over-run with the living dead; like he is already one of the dreadful \"geeks\", replacing an insatiable hunger for living flesh with a need for power and control. It is deliciously ironic that his downfall is the only thing in this dying world that can revive the spirit of humanity in him, especially since it comes a day too late.Novak's self-imposed quest to find his killer drives the impetus of the plot, and through it we see humanity at its best and worst. The characters we meet on Glen's hunt are complete beings, and we are surprised to find ourselves sympathizing with those we initially hated, and loathing those we at first liked.The detective story itself is just as engaging as the action and horror, with the author sprinkling in just enough clues for we the readers to figure it out. I HATE mystery novels that withhold vital clues until the final scenes. This one offers us a view through Novak's eyes, giving us subtle hints along the way that the anti-hero Novak is just a bit too focused (or dim) to see. Glen Novak is certainly no Sherlock, and I appreciate that we are given things through his un-educated eyes. Where Sherlock might take time to ponder what he has learned, or consult Watson, Novak simply continues to senselessly pound his opponents until he can make sense of their mutterings.The first half of the novel is a wonderful slow-burn: an exposition of mood and character interaction, and an insight into Novak's tarnished soul. We get drawn into the cares and worries of the inhabitants of Devon, and Novak's effects on (and connections to) them. As expected, it seems like everyone has a reason to want him dead!But when the Dinner Bell rings, we find ourselves in a whirlwind of frenetic activity, and are rewarded with spectacularly-written, extended-action sequences. I could barely believe it when it seemed like the beginning of the climax was reached and I glanced down to my Kindle claiming it was only 58% of the way through. And the story just kept getting more intense from there! I'm reminded of author Matthew Reilly's (the Shane \"Scarecrow\" Schofield novels) style of prose: fast-paced, with constant action and unrelenting stakes. And through it all, the foundation of noir and horror this novel was written on still makes itself unignorable.With the single-day timespan and initial hubris of our main character, I am tempted to call this a Greek tragedy (especially with the scattering of mythological monikers). Luckily, there is no discernable chorus (flash-backs are kept to a minimum and only used to heighten tension & reveal character); nor is there any Deus ex Machina to put things right or ultimately save / condemn Novak. As with us all, his fate is in his own hands.Definitely a must-read if the description seems even slightly interesting to you."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4030443-kate", "userReview": "A cynical noir antihero meets zombies - sorry, geeks - in what's a pretty darn clever update on the zombie survival genre. I don't even LIKE zombie novels, and this one kept me reading - with distinctive, if rather unlikeable (in that wonderful noir way), characters and a race-to-the-finish-line plot, it was pretty hard to step away, even when the geeks were coming fast and furious and the humans were as awful as the monsters they were fighting. The rendering of a postapocalyptic mini-society was realistic, if depressing, and Novak's determination to get revenge for his impending death-and-undeath was true to form for the best gritty noir.Also, loved the terminology of \"geek\" for zombie.

Glen Novak was shot in the head and his thoughts and feelings have not been erased, well not yet anyway. Humans are practically extinct. The war that started over five years ago is over. The human race is gone so who is telling this story and how why does he have one day: 24 hours to make things right? What exactly does he think he will accomplish? Why? This man\u2019s entire world ended five years ago. A strange and mysterious plague soared through the world, depleted human society and destroyed everything and everyone he held dear. Hoping to survive and working along a group of men just like him and equally as dangerous, he winds up caught in a trap that will lead him to his final demise. Once a wrestling coach and now a hunter hoping to find any remnants of life, semblance of humanity in order to make things right. Those we meet in this novel are real people not geeks as he describes himself after someone gives him that fatal bite. Those living in Devon in the same building are Jim Sorensen, Christopher Stewart, Dave Pulaski, John, Michelle and many more who make up the group he calls the gang. A group that is feared and dangerous hoping to as the author states, \u201ctip the balance of power,\u201d Greg\u2019s direction. Pulaski, a born killer, someone who took care of the geeks, carved them up and made sure that they did not infect anyone else. Their bodies littering the streets, the stench you can only imagine and sight horrific. Ricky Robellada was part of his team and someone you did not want to come up against in a fight. Scars on his face and hands, a body that looked emaciated, skin darker and tougher he was one of his feared gang members. Add in Tom Martinez and that comprises his group that note what is happening in place called the Barricade. Everyone lived behind the lines of this Barricade. This place held for ten of them and if anyone broke through they went to the Athena and where they killed and murdered the geeks. There were many others on duty that protected the elder on the inner wall of the Barricade. The author describes how this gang moves, what they do and what they find. The scenes are vividly described, graphic and you can see the deterioration, smell the decay of the bodies and wonder how they even live for any length of time. The Hotel Athena overlooks Devon. Once a place many would want to stay now transformed into a sea of death. The description that the author relates on page 43 will make you shudder as the metal gate over the front doors and bars on the windows more prison like. As he makes his way into the hotel and has one person in mind that he needs to find. Glen is no one to trifle with as he finds his mark, explains why he is there and relates that some of his gang is now dead because they were bitten. Anyone bitten is automatically killed. But, confrontations occur and more people are killed as those bitten are eliminated and Novak searches for answers of his own. One man comes at him with a gun in a bar and another takes him out. Approach the man he thinks sent him proves interesting and enlightening to the reader as you learn more about this demented world filled with misfits, killers, and those struggling to stay alive or rule others. The person in charge of the investigation proves somewhat capable as the real person; the Reverend appears not to care. As Novak moves about from place to place he hides the bite on his hand, hopes no one will discover his fate or he won\u2019t be able to even last that one more day that he needs to find his killer and make things right in his own world and mind. When the man he thinks sent someone to kill him claims he wants him to join forces with him, the end result would not exactly make them friends. Which one is telling the truth and whom can anyone trust? Those that watch his back and protect him kill when necessary to save themselves and Novak. As the day wears on so does Novak\u2019s spirit and body decline and fall apart. Like a person with a terminal disease that eats away at their brain, body and mind within certain time limits, what happens to him would be any fatal disease fast forwarded and in fast motion. Calomiris vs. Novak that\u2019s what it seems to come down to at this time. One man killed on the Calomiris side sets off a chain of events and reactions that are quite violent, graphic and almost typical of kids who seek revenge on other gang members when the possible culprit is dead or justice needs to be served. Society has a definite way it views people and in this world created by author Justin Robinson, although most are what we call zombies and others semi-human, class distinctions still exist as far as how people are treated, protected and the availability of services that they need to survive in world that does not really exist in the true sense of the word. Two separate factions: those on the Hill and protected by the Barricade and those in the Athena protected by Calomiris and his minions. Threats fly, the body count increases and Novak hopes that no one will notice the state his body is in and the fact that as the day wears on so does his life where thin. But, push comes to shove as a confrontation ensues between Novak and Rippey the Reverend and the end result will surprise you as you learn who comes to Novak\u2019s aid when things get violent, someone opens the gate and lets in the wrong people and the threat of getting bitten is real. Flashing back in his mind to his life before as a coach and gym teacher he visualizes how his life used to be before the end came. Fast- forwarding to the present he reminds himself of the true nature of the new world which is survival of the strongest, fittest and most powerful. Violence and revenge see to reign over logic and reasoning even when others try. Cool heads never seem to prevail and Glen will stop at nothing to find out why he is one of the undead. Society, as the author depicts it is comprised of those who only care about themselves, taking control of the three factions, Athena, the Hill and Town and deciding which serves them the best. Memories of Susan come into his mind and just as quickly dissipate and disappear. Final confrontations, realizations and come front and center, more lives are lost, truths are revealed and deceits uncovered before the final shot is fired, the next head is lopped off and the true killer is revealed. Loyalties are questioned, trust is overrated, and one man tries to right one wrong before his time runs out. Just what happens and who comes out if you can call it that alive and still on top? You will have to read Undead On Arrival to find out the end result to see if the Undead Win, the Hill, Athena, Town or if you could call what happens winning at all. Author Justin Robinson may have created a world of fiction that might remind the reader of some of what is going on in the world today filled with hate, deceit, lies, and of course senseless killings but this book definitely should give you much pause for thought and reason to stop and think about how we can make the world before it\u2019s too late a better place.

I found this book because I read the author's short story \"Gone Fishin'\" in the Undead Worlds: A Reanimated Writers Anthology and liked it so much I was hoping he had written a full length book about zombies as well and Yay! He did! Seriously the characters in this book are so real, the horror of what's happened and continues to be their reality and the way they each deal with it... the way the author doesn't shy away from the horribleness that people inflict on each other, including the main character who you admire for his strength to adhere to some sort of code even while condemning a lot of the things he does and/or choices he's made because he's better than a lot of others who are in power over people in this world.

Discovering a severed head in his locker just after being bitten by it, he sets out for revenge against whoever wants him out of the way. There's a lot of people to go through and not a whole lot of time, but he's a dedicated man. He'll break bones, even kill those who stand in his way. As the infection slowly overtakes him, he gets more desperate, but he'll stop at nothing to being down his murderer. (Please be aware, before reading further, that this review may contain spoilers.)I have to say, this is a different sort of zombie novel, at least unlike those I've read before. Instead of simple survival, this centres on the very last hours of someone's life after they've been bitten, so as you can imagine, there's no happy endings. It falls under a genre I'm not too familiar with; noir, so the setting is bleak. This isn't supposed to be a pleasant book, on the contrary, it delves into a lot of ugliness where humanity is just as horrific, if not worse, than the walking dead. The main character, Glen Novak, isn't even all that likeable, but even so, I wanted to see how it would end for him and if he would indeed uncover the identity of the person that ultimately doomed him. There were quite a few suspects; the husbands of wives he used for sexual favours, those weaker than himself that he pushed around, or just those wanting his seat of power. Novak, one of three leaders, owned a third of the barricaded community of Devon; the Hill. There was also the Athena (the huge, overlooking hotel), owned by Walter Calamoris and the Town, owned by Rippey, a very questionable Reverend. These were separate factions, all with very complicated relationships. I thought this was great world-building because, let's face it, even when the apocalypse is upon us, humanity will still split apart. There will always be things to divide us and there will always be power plays, right until the very end. Robinson did a fantastic job conveying just how imperfect the human race is, however, because he did it so well, there's very little people to like, if any at all. I feel I need at least one character to get attached to in a book, or else I don't really care for anyone's fate and that can lead to the experience being very unmemorable. Pulaski was someone who stood out the most, but certainly not a person I'd ever want to meet. Stew seemed like a nice guy (and he did play D&D), but can you really be a nice person with you're following someone like Novak?The plot itself was very much a \"whodunnit\" and I admit, I didn't figure it out until near the end, so I appreciated it not being obvious throughout. Women were, it appeared, a minority and mostly seen as sex objects. I do love strong females, but this world was very much a mans one indeed, with little equality. I've stated in previous reviews of how off-putting it can be for male writers to portray women in such a way. What's not to like about females kicking butt along with the men? Granted, it didn't bother me quite as much here, but it's something I notice a lot with men writing fiction. The book was also chock-full of profanities, but that just added to the realism - people curse, it shouldn't be a shock, and if it is, I have to ask what world you're living on.Robinson's writing is extremely straightforward at times and whilst I'm not saying this is a bad thing, I believe the build-up of suspense can suffer because of it. I don't need purple prose or overly flowery writing, but more detail can help in certain instances, at least to flesh out what's happening and to create more tension. I felt that the ending was a tad rushed, whereas the bulk of the story was drawn out. Included were a number of shocks that seemed almost out of place, just there to get a reaction from the reader. I like shocks, but when they make sense - why have a \"geek\" chained up in the Athena just for entertainment, sexual or otherwise? They seemed pretty bothered about Doctor Bloch keeping a few for research, but a sex-zombie is fine! Despite everything, I am a fan of Robinson and I will read more of his works. Undead on Arrival was a pretty average read for me, so I hope I find more gems of his, like City of Devils.Notable Scene:Pulaski finished with the lipstick and carefully blotted it with a tissue. He looked around the table, at all the little metal tubes they'd scavenged over the years and selected one. \"I did. I had three older sisters. They used to do this to me when I was little. Make me up, put me in their clothes kind of thing. Pissed my dad off, but it made Mom laugh. It was the only time my sisters paid attention to me.

I thought it was going to turn into a really cool zombie book and I was going to love it. And there are a lot of reasons why I didn't.To be fair, this is probably more accurately somewhere in 1.5 star range. I didn't particularly like it, but some of it was ok. Which is the division between 1 star and 2 stars, so.Listen, I get it. I don't mind reading books with swearing or explicit sexual content or super messed up things happening in them. I enjoy morally ambiguous characters and shades of grey and anti-heroes. I understand why your zombie apocalypse book would take the dark and gritty approach.I really do.But there is a fine line between doing all of those things because they are necessary for the narrative and being gratuitous about it. This book has no idea where that line is drawn and doesn't particularly seem to care. And instead of enhancing the book, it just made me roll my eyes.That said, there were a few interesting gems here and there. The worldbuilding has been thought out. It put its own spin on the genre and I think that worked out well for it. There were also some interesting characters who were incidentally not heteronormative. The overall cast was racially diverse. And there were descriptions of people of a variety of body types.But it was still a cast dominated by men. What little women there were to be had were treated appallingly by the narrative. Their dominant (and generally, only) role was that of sex object. If not that, then as a breeder to carry on the next generation. They were all framed in that context and at one point or another were all called varying denigrating slurs.I understand that there's a difference between character perspective and author perspective. I do. But at the end of the day, the author is still making intentional choices about how that character acts and interacts with others.Novak is not a good guy. And I get that too. It's part of what makes him interesting and, at times, compelling. But again, there's the line between necessity and gratuity. I read this book in about 24 hours because I had a lot of sitting around and waiting going on in my day today. I finished it tonight because I was most of the way through it already.

It's a classic noir murder mystery set in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse, chronicling the tale of Glen Novak attempting to solve his own murder before being devoured by the zombie plague he has been purposely infected with. I'm not normally into noir or murder mysteries (I enjoy them, but I've never focused on them particularly), but this one was great. The writing wastes zero time. it is, in the truest of sense of the phrase, all killer no filler. The setting is a small coastal town in California that's managed to work out a semi-stable sense of order within it's walls, although one that turns out to be completely illusory. The tensions in the town are well balanced between the ever-present worry of an undead swarm and the political tension between the town's power players: the wealthy, elitists on the hill, the religious tribe in the town, and Novak's smaller contingent of free-thinking, free-loving pragmatists. And the basic tension that kept me turning the pages, was wondering what was going to destroy Novak first: His bite, the undead, the bloody political machinations of the town, or the way he kept making bloody enemies with his fists. If you're not into bloody depictions of gore and horror, then this may not be the book for you. Novak isn't really the kind of guy who fucks around, and once his death warrant is signed, less so. But, if that kind of thing is up your alley, Jesus does this book deliver. The zombie (geek) mythology is well-designed, the action sequences are frequent and fun, and Glen's desire for bloody revenge eventually snowballs into a blood-soaked, body-stacked finale that left me wanting to smoke a cigarette. Or to take up smoking 5 years previously so I could close the book, light up, take a long drag and slowly exhale while saying, \"Oh yeah, that hit the spot.\"If you like zombies, if you like murder mysteries, if you light tight, well-crafted stories that don't waste your time, pick this book up immediately."}, {"userName": "Leila", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11256583-leila", "userReview": "With zombies saturating the market lately in the form of movies and books, I was a little skeptical about how I'd feel when I finished this book. There was absolutely no reason for me to worry.Although it's a novel about zombies, I really enjoyed the fresh take on how survivors would act post-zombie apocalypse. (I'm assuming it's a fresh take; I don't really love zombie stories and haven't read a ton of them) And since it follows just one man and only for one day, I didn't get overwhelmed with scenes about people constantly being scared for their lives, or turning on each other to survive. Robinson skipped that part and focused on a world in which there was a functioning society, as much as a society could function at that point. In the story, I followed a man who was cautious, rather than fearful. Aware of his surroundings, relying on only a few other men to have his back while he covered theirs.Robinson takes care to write in details that make the world seem much more realistic. Endless supply of gasoline for cars? Nope. How do they function without electricity? He tells you how. What's traded for what, what's the worth of jewelry? I love all of the tiny touches he's put in his novel, how he fills in a world behind the main character.I loved the tone of the novel, and the writer's voice is amazing.

The zombie apocalypse has happened, and it weighs heavily over everything. It is not a lighthearted romp through post-industrial society.

The book is bleak, but manages not to be without hope.The violence is matter-of-fact, but not fetishistic (zombie fiction of all media is prone to this trap).The characters are real. I have a sense for how the survivors will interact with each other after the book has finished. Yes, it's a book about a guy who is bitten by a weaponized zombie and decides to figure out who killed him before he turns. But it's not just a detective story, a zombie story, or a story of escalating conflict in a small California town. There are Themes, but they never once get in the way of the story."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10647030-scott", "userReview": "Glen Novak is a dead man. Unfortunately for the scumbag that had the guts to take him out, Novak will keep on cracking skulls and breaking bones until he either finds the piece of trash that set him up for a geek bite, or is forced to take himself out before he turns into a walking sack of rotten meat. With Undead On Arrival, Justin Robinson gives us a hard boiled take on the Zombie genre that stands out as one of the most compellingly brutal examinations of the living dead you\u2019ll ever read. Through the eyes of Novak we are forced to experience firsthand what it means to watch and more importantly, feel, your body slowly blacken and die, becoming a thing with its own wants and needs. For those wishing to avoid becoming geek-bait in the upcoming zombie apocalypse, Undead On Arrival is must reading."}, {"userName": "T.j.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11141560-t-j", "userReview": "Mr. Novak is not a nice person. Then again, there are few nice people in noir novels; its how light the grey is that defines the protagonist. He does questionable things; he'll make you downright disgusted at times. But, due in large part to Mr. Robinson's deft characterization of the populace of Devon, you will root for him nevertheless. Undead on Arrival is a meld of dark noir, zombie fiction, and a bit of historical siege warfare in one that starts fast and continuously builds momentum until the end (though there is a small bit where I imagined the army from Monty Python's the Holy Grail yelling \"Get on with it!\"). Clever (but not too clever) with red herrings to spare, I highly enjoyed reading Undead on Arrival."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1511435-holly", "userReview": "This zombie noir thriller is a suspenseful, satisfying read, as evidenced by the fact that I couldn't put it down and finished it in one day. Not to say I liked the characters; I didn't, as they were all pretty horrible human beings. But they were incredibly interesting, and actual characters and not simply cardboard cut-outs made to walk around a post-apocalyptic novel like dolls. No, these characters were despicable yet compelling and complex. The plot was intense, and the story world itself was one of the most interesting zombie worlds that I've seen. A gripping, bloody tale, and one that I hope won't give me too many nightmares."}, {"userName": "Nik Morton", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1548866-nik-morton", "userReview": "Joseph Conrad's character Kurtz said 'The horror! The horror!' in The Heart of Darkness. He could have been alluding to this slice of zombie fiction. The horror is unrelenting, from the doom-laden beginning to the riveting end. This book is not for the squeamish, being peppered with blood, gore, swearing and sex, but it certainly maintains an uncanny quite clammy grip of suspense, while grimly examining the duality of human nature. (I wrote the above as an advance review for the book and still abide by it). This is a grim and compelling page-turner and it's good to see so many readers appreciating it.

This is not the last society of good that has clung together against the hungry maw of the undead, this is where every hardened murdering psychopath that you need in a zombie movie ends up after the rest of his happy-go-lucky group gets slaughtered by the undead.It is gritty. It is dark. Its humor is really dark. And it is fantastic story. With a colorful crew of characters who are both impossible and absolutely recognizable.Undead on Arrival delivers. From police riot shield. To the silent slice of shining silver.

When he gets bitten, he knows he has about 24 hours left and is determined to exact revenge before he puts himself down. (He uses 'fag' and 'pussy' as perjorative terms, but he's not supposed to be a 'good' character and so I'd like to think the author used that as part of his portrayal as a complex and toxicly masculine character.)I didn't realize it until I got on the GoodReads website, but this is the same author who wrote \"City of Devils\", another four star review of mine."}, {"userName": "Clint Wolf", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10673225-clint-wolf", "userReview": "Something is rotten in the Central California town of Devon... and it's not just the smell of the zombies besieging its walls.

It's a sort of \"who dunnit/apocolypse/zombie/thriller\". The writing and suspense are real and true, albeit a bit unsavory at times. That's really my only warning about this book...Robinson sure likes his characters to talk like sailors. Everything happens within a single day - the last of Novak's life, but seems an eternity. Time slows down then your heart races through gritty action scenes. Not so much a zombie fest as used to, but still worth a read if you seek...BRAINS."}, {"userName": "J.
