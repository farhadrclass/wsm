The cover looks emergent - not interested. The promo line reads something like this: \"a punk-rock approach to the pressing issue of gaining ground as rapidly as the early church\" - not interested. However, a quick scan in the acknowledgments caught my attention. One of the author's heroes is Martyn-Lloyd Jones. Now I'm interested. Then I learn that the author is a church planter in the U.K. Now I'm really interested. With family roots in the U.K. and a deep admiration for men like John Bunyan, John Owen, and C.H. Spurgeon, my heart has been saddened for many years to see the decline of the church in the land of my forefathers. Anyone who has a passion to reach these people for Christ has my attention!Church Zero: Raising 1st Century Churches Out of the Ashes of the 21st Century Church by Peyton Jones is a warning to the church; it is a warning to stop playing church. Much like a fired-up football coach on the sidelines, Jones tosses the challenge flag and alerts the church to some dangers he sees; dangers that have plagued the church for quite some time. One danger is the propensity for pastors to build their own \"personal empires.\" Scripture demands something altogether different, namely - the expansion of God's kingdom. The author confronts the typical model found in many mega church structures (and I would argue that this same mentality is smoldering in the hearts of many smaller churches as well):1. Get more people2. More people = more money3. More money = more toys4. More toys - more ways to get people5. Get more people (rinse and repeat)Some churches clean up this formula by exchanging \"toys\" for \"tools.\" Now the model is \"sanctified\" so to speak. If the formula for success doesn't ring a bell, perhaps the formula for failure will:\"Fewer people = less money = fewer toys = less ability to get people, which equals less money again.\" Jones rightly argues, \"Church can become a pastor's own personal tower of Babel in which he refuses to spread out and multiply to the glory of God. Babel teaches us that bigger is not always better.\"Jones essentially argues that we need to stop quibbling over the meaning of the word \"apostle\" and get busy doing the work of apostles - which means church planting. He stands alongside Paul the apostle in pleading with churches to do the work of the ministry fully equipped with apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor-teachers.The author maintains, \"The pastor-only club is killing the leadership of the church. Guys are burning out, losing their families, sabotaging their marriages, or simply going back to selling used cars. It's time those of you in ministry got your life back.\" So Jones proceeds to unpack the essence and make-up of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers - each of which \"pulls on the average believer to do something that he wouldn't normally be equipped or constrained to do.\" The takeaway is this: People must be mobilized for ministry. Part of that mobilization involves recognizing the giftedness in people and releasing them to minister to the flock and reach lost people.Church Zero is earthy and even a bit crude at time - so was Martin Luther. This book will make some people mad - sometimes John Calvin upset people (sometimes he still upsets people!) Church Zero will convict - much like Spurgeon sermon. Some will question the approach and tone of the author. Some may even assign false motives. But at the end of the day, when all the chips have been played, readers will be thankful that Peyton Jones wrote this book. He asks the right questions and gives solid biblical answers. His heart for church planting is on every page. My hope is that God will use this book for his purposes and awaken a new breed of church planters who proclaim God's truth without apology and spark a new reformation in our generation; a reformation that is fueled by revival that is generated exclusively by the Holy Spirit.Church Zero concludes with these stirring words: \"Every church reformation has turned the tide of battle so that the church was charging through the barbed wire on the offensive, instead of hiding in foxholes on the defensive, praying that the shelling would stop ... All church reformers shared on thing in common with every man who has ever spilled hid blood on the field of battle; they valued victory for the cause more than their own lives ... I believe that the church's final hour will be its finest hour if it has the stomach for waging war to drive back the gates of hell.\"www.baldreformer.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872570-kim", "userReview": "This book was so painful to get through that I did almost give up on it. I'm completely in agreement with the Church looking more like the 1st Century believers, and I am involved in a house gathering group myself and no longer attend an organized religious institution. So, I don't fault the author for the subject matter or the actual information provided. I had to rate this as only 2 stars though because the pop culture references were overwhelming and obnoxious. A reference to the A-Team or the Lord of the Rings here or there is fine to keep the reader engaged and to try and grab the attention of perhaps a 40-something audience, but there were a few sentences where the author references two or three different pop culture items in the same sentence. It got to be ridiculous and was distracting overall. And, if you weren't a child of the 80's, you're not going to understand a lot of the references. The book often pointed out that pastors aren't supposed to be \"entertainers\" yet the author didn't seem to take his own advice with this book and stick to the meat and leave out the fluff."}, {"userName": "Arthur O'dell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2126507-arthur-o-dell", "userReview": "Don't be put off by the many pop culture references. The book is solidly Biblical, and it made me think through some questions that have been bothering me for a long time. First, it is far too easy to be the church we want to be rather than the church God calls us to be. Second, all of us in the church have gifts that need to he used for the mission; if all we do is sit in an auditorium once a week to listen to a band and hear a public speaker we have gotten way off track. This book is well worth reading for anyone who has a desire for God and wants to live in obedience to His Calling."}, {"userName": "Mark Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5668120-mark-barnes", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this book -- partly because I know the author, and partly because like him I want to see the church stirred up and become more biblical.In it, Peyton does three things. First, he argues for a particular understanding of church leadership in the New Testament. Second, he claims that the contemporary church has ignored this model for two long (with chapters like \"Why Your Church Sucks\"). Third, he finishes with a passionate call to put things right.The book is bristling with pop-culture references, which you'll probably either love or hate. In the first chapter we're told, \"the post-Christian mind-set... [was] swallowing churches alive... like the mightly Sarlacc pit's digestive juices slowing eroding Boba Fett's Mandalorian body armor\". Wikipedia had to come to my rescue for that (something to do with Star Wars, apparently).The final third of the book is undoubtedly the best. I found myself carried along by Peyton's passion for church planting, despite all the hardships it can entail. His emphasis on the need for the Spirit's help is much-needed, and refreshing. Take this as an example: \"The wind can't be tamed; it blows where it pleases. But I'll tell you where it pleases. Anywhere somebody is yearning to glorify Christ and step out in faith will find the roaring wind of the Holy Spirit at his or her back.\" Amen to that!But unfortunately there are deep problems with the main part of the book. One problem is theological, the other is more about the book's character.Let's deal with the theology first. Peyton's main argument is that the office of apostle is one that was present in the first century, but is missing today. It's this lack (together with a lack of prophets and evangelists) that is causing much of the problems in the contemporary church. Peyton makes clear that he's talking about apostles with a small `a' -- \"a lesser group of church planters who served under Paul\". And he's right to point out that Bible does describe many such people as apostoloi. He argues that today we won't have apostles like James and Peter, but we should have small `a' apostles like Titus, Barnabas, Apollos and so on, and that church-planters are these modern-day apostles. So far, so good.But where does Paul fit into this? According to Peyton, \"Paul was not one of the Twelve, but he was a kind of link between the twelve apostles who were there from the beginning and those who would take his place\". Perhaps that's the case, perhaps not. But it certainly is clear from the NT that Paul was closer in authority and qualifications to the Twelve than he was to the small `a' apostles. Yet in Church Zero it's not the small `a' apostles that become the model for a modern-day church planter, it's Paul. He gets mentioned nearly 200 times in the book, nearly three times more than all the small `a' apostles put together. That's a big problem if you believe that Paul's role in the church was foundational and meant to be a model for today. And if you're someone who believes the small `a' apostles are to be a model, you'll surely be disappointed that Paul steals all their thunder.Equally problematic is the lack of discussion as to who it was who sent the small `a' apostles. Peyton says they were \"sent out by Jesus\", but these small `a' apostles were not sent out directly by Jesus in the way that the twelve were. When we do find reference to their sending, we find they were sent by the church or by Paul (see particularly Acts 11:22 \"they sent Barnabas to Antioch\", and Philippians 2:19-29, but also Acts 15:22, 27, 17:10, 19:22, 1 Corinthians 4:17, and 1 Thessalonians 3:2). Indeed, it could be argued that the difference between the twelve and the small `a' apostles is that the twelve were directly commissioned by Jesus (as was Paul, of course), whereas the small `a' apostles were commissioned by the church. Peyton's right to say we should be looking for small `a' apostles today, but he's missed the New Testament's emphasis by not adding that they should be sent out and commissioned by the church.That leads me onto my second, even deeper concern - the character of the book. Peyton says he loves the church, and I believe him, but he's got a strange way of showing it. Early on, he tells us that \"the church inchworms pathetically on its mission like a fat little grub\". As one Amazon reviewer said, \"men usually don't take kindly to that kind of talk about their wives, even if the old lady is fat and not what she once was. It's still the Groom's bride -- show respect, dude.\"It's not just the church that faces such heavy-handed criticism. Those who serve in seminaries are \"brain-heavy, pasty-white, [and] book-nosed... more wired for holding ground than taking it\". Pastors have a \"comfortable lifestyle\" and refuse to understand the Bible's teaching on church leadership because \"it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it\". I know many seminarians, and many pastors, and this description fits none of them. They have their faults certainly, but they are as committed to gospel-advancement as any church-planter I know, including Peyton himself.Church Zero then, is deeply flawed. It's passionate and edgy, and its aim of continuing to reform the church is the right one. But it's built on too shaky a theology to be truly reforming, and even worse, it slanders both the bride of Christ and the gifts he gave her. It's not a book that will win friends, and it will ultimately end up preaching only to the choir -- albeit a punk rock choir."}, {"userName": "Joey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67567443-joey", "userReview": "A timely and challenging read for me.

Cook shows us Raising 1st Century Churches out of the Ashes of the 21st Century Church.From the Back Cover: It\u2019s Time to start over from zero. What happened to the Western Church? When did we stop being radical, dangerous, and impossible to ignore? Why are we losing the generation under 30 and reaching so few nonbelievers?In Church Zero, Peyton Jones says one of our big problems is this: we squeeze our leaders into a mold that cuts their hair and drains away their commando strength.Scripture lays out a leadership model that worked explosively in the first century\u2014but frankly, we\u2019re scared of it. We don\u2019t have to be. When properly understood, Christ\u2019s model can help your church live the way the body was meant to live, truly making a difference in your community. Church Zero gives the blueprints for how the Western Church might start rebuilding from the ground up if a pipe bomb were placed underneath all of our church structures overnight. What would tomorrow look like if we had to restart from a biblical ground zero?Church Zero will help us once again become a radical, dangerous people who cannot be ignored. It\u2019s time to break out of the matrix.I do not have a problem with what we now call mega-churches. I guess sometimes it is easier to go and fit in with a large crowd. However we need the smaller churches to meet the needs of the individuals and we need the Pastors to shepherd them. However there are not enough churches! When I was growing up there was practically a church every few blocks. Now you need to travel to find a church. To get churches planted we need planters or what Paul called apostles. In eleven chapters Mr. Jones goes into the problem and the solution on how we should get the new church planted. He addresses the need and provides solutions. I believe this book is for everybody whether or not you will be a church planter. You see once the new church is planted someone has to bring the unchurched to church and if you understand what is going on in your new home you will be more equipped to help out.You can find \u201cChurch Zero\u201d at a discount at http://www.deepershopping.com/item/jo...If you would like to listen to interviews with other authors and professionals please go to www.kingdomhighlights.org where they are available On Demand.To listen to 24 hours non-stop, commercial free Christian music please visit our internet radio station www.kingdomairwaves.orgDisclosure of Material Connection: I received this book for free from David C.

The first few chapters are spent digging into the understanding of the word \"apostle\" in the 1st century. Jones distinguishes between the big-A \"Apostles\" and lowercase-a \"apostles\", explaining that Apostles were the men who were personally discipled by Jesus while \"apostles\" are the God-given role of church planters in the church. Several chapters are designated to defining the roles of pastors, prophets, apostles, teachers, and evangelists, which are often referred to as the five-fold ministry but Jones calls FIST leaders (think of a hand with five fingers, which when all connected makes a powerful fist). Jones spends his final chapters advocating for the importance of the church, the way it needs to be active in our world, and how we can be a part of making the church fulfill its purpose in this world.From the onset of this book, I had never thought of the apostles as church planters before. But now as we're see a large church planting movement arising in America, connecting this role to the early church makes a lot of sense and is really fitting. Jones does well in his exegesis of Scripture while keeping it connected to theology and practical ministry. I extremely appreciate Jones' positive view of the church. As a staff pastor leading several ministries, this book was encouraging to my heart and gave me some creative ideas for helping to make my church and ministries healthy by helping to get people plugged into the right places. I especially appreciated Jones' chapter on gifts-based ministry.The only disappointment I have with Jones' writings is that every reference he had to FIST leaders was masculine. Even though he mentioned Huldah and Deborah as prophets, he never considered in any other portion that women could still be prophets--or any other type of FIST leader--today. There was one reference to Priscilla working alongside her husband to teach women, but that was it. Also, as a Pentecostal, Jones seemed to portray a somewhat negative view of the pentecostal/charismatic tradition and practices. This was not blatant or alarming, but enough to make me stop and have to say \"mmm...bummer.\" Jones seems to come from a reformed tradition, though he does well with branching out and discussing historic figures from other traditions as well, such as John Wesley.Overall, I thank Peyton Jones for writing this book. It affirmed that I am not called to be a church planter--ha!--but gave me a better understanding for those who are called to it, as well as affirming some of the gifts that God has placed in me as a FIST leader. I rate it 4.5 out of 5 stars.**I received a complimentary copy of this book from David C.

Actually it is messing me up more and more each day as I mull over the implications of this revolutionary book. Peyton Jones has gave words to many frustrations I have had and was unable to articulate. He has also laid down a biblical solution to fix the issues that plague the church. I have been witness to pastors whose only ambition was job security. This ambition does not build the kingdom of God. I first received this book last year in July as a free Kindle download (sorry Peyton). He initially lost me in the first chapters. I thought this book was about restoring the New Testament church. What's all this talk about apostles? I put the book down until just last month. I am certainly glad I picked it back up. I am certain it was God who had me pick the book up calling me to plant a church within the next two years. I now understand the focus of apostle in the first chapters. He says, \"If we ignore the biblical roles Christ gave us to accomplish the mission, then our structure will be wrong. If the structure is wrong, then the functionality will be limited. If the functionality is limited, then our mission will be compromised. If our mission is compromised, we won't be as effective as Jesus intended.\" The work of the Apostles and the apostles in the Bible are foundational to the structure that Christ has given us in Scripture. I would recommend this book to every church planter out there. Here is a book highlighting the foundation of church planting and church growth as given to us by Jesus. I would also recommend this book to current church pastors and leaders. It gives a rallying cry for churches to become sending churches and challenges the current paradigm of church being a one man show. Lay people should also read this book and challenge their leaders to review the biblical model given to us by Jesus himself. They should be encouraged to give towards church planting and to supporting church planting teams. Just today I have bought two paper copies of the book (cha-ching-cha-ching). One for my wife and one for a friend I am encouraging to become a church planter. I anticipate buying more books in the future in order to give to my church planting team and sending churches."}, {"userName": "Lane Corley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15796934-lane-corley", "userReview": "Great book with a raw, refreshing, kingdom centered approach to church leadership & church planting. Peyton Jones speaks plainly about business as usual & CEO approaches that have turned the movement of Jesus into an enterprise. Also, gives great instruction to returning to Ephesians 4:11-12 leadership \u2013 Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Shepherds, Teachers \u2013 describing the roles of each with how they function together. Adding this one to my Church Planting Bibliography.A few quotes:- Shame on the church planter who is church planting simply because nobody will give him a church of his own! Equal shame, however, is also due to the pastor who is afraid to lose people because he needs their money for fuel to keep the machine running.- Church planting is essentially bringing the unique gospel community presence of Jesus Christ into the midst of a surrounding non-gospel community.- Jesus was an army of one\u2026 You\u2019re not.- church planting is less Field of Dreams & more True Grit.the Western church today is obsessed with size, the first-century church was obsessed with reach, & that made all the difference.- The church\u2019s command from Jesus was not to \u201chold till I return\u201d but to \u201csecure the beachhead\u201d of every distant shore.- The focus shouldn\u2019t be cramming more people into churches, but seeing more people rescued from the tyranny of Satan, sin, & self. If that means merging churches, halving churches, or helping other churches, then we\u2019d gladly do it to see people rescued\u2026- church planting is not a spectator sport.

In Church Zero, Peyton Jones examines one of our biggest problems: squeezing our leaders into a mold that cuts their hair and drains away their commando strength. Scripture lays out a leadership model that worked explosively in the first century. When properly understood, Christ\u2019s model can help your church live the way it was meant to live, truly making a difference in your community. Church Zero gives the blueprints for how the Western church might start rebuilding from the ground up. What would tomorrow look like if we had to restart from a biblical ground zero? Church Zero will help us once again become a radical, dangerous people who cannot be ignored.", "title": "Church Zero: Raising 1st Century Churches out of the Ashes of the 21st Century Church", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17347037-church-zero", "average": 3.78, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361293725l/17347037.jpg", "reviews": 37, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5814494.Peyton_Jones", "name": "Peyton Jones"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2946652.Jon_Gauger", "name": "Jon Gauger"}], "type": ["Religion", "Religion", "Christian", "Nonfiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17347037-church-zero", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19426334-church-zero", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13595514-church-zero", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18046555-church-zero", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30649314-reaching-the-unreached", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29010390-the-ninja-church-planter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29570781-jump-school-core-team-training-series-study-guide"]}
