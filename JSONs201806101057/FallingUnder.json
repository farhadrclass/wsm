How the happier you are the more you know the sky is about to explode into tiny, sparkling shards of glass that will pick up speed as they fall to the earth and slice right through you leaving your skin with little holes in it, leaving your heart bleeding.\u201d\n\nIt took me the longest time to get into this book. But once I did, it was difficult to stop. The beautiful sentences kept flowing and I was simply in awe \u2013 the writing style is quite lovely. The author writes about ordinary things in such an extraordinary manner.This is a story of Mara Foster, young artist who is struggling with anxiety. The story is told alternating between past and present. The main event in the book is the death of her college boyfriend, Lucas. It\u2019s something that defined her, and we see events lining up to it, and we see after \u2013 Mara trying to deal with it. There\u2019s a lot of guilt in Mara; she\u2019s damaged, struggling with living her life despite her guilt which is crippling her. When she meets Hugo, she finally has a chance at happiness, but first \u2013 she must chase away her demons. We get to know Mara by witnessing her daily struggles, seeing how her past relationships defined her. In her past, when she was 16, Mara had an affair with Caleb, a 34-year old painter who was her mentor of sorts. Then there was Lucas whose death left a huge impact on Mara and from whose loss she\u2019s still recovering. In the present she has an occasional lover Erik to whom she runs when her demons are too much. And finally, Hugo, this really sweet guy with a dog. And that\u2019s really all I have to say about Hugo. We meet him first and right away we\u2019re presented with the idea that he\u2019s the one. The one for whom Mara will get better. I, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t help but root for Erik. And Caleb. The whole book was intense. If I had to choose one word to describe Falling Under it\u2019d be that. And Erik was intense, his relationship with Mara was nothing but intense. I felt like with Erik, Mara had something real. I liked Hugo in the beginning, but later on I cooled off, I guess. I missed that intensity she had in her previous relationships.\n\n\u201cSometimes my ears are full of screaming, and sometimes, like tonight, the voices are mine. Erik had them too \u2013 demons, voices. Nightmares seared on the soul \u2013 I knew it the first time I saw him. And sometime, when there are large, dark spaces inside that you cannot escape, sometimes someone can meet you there, keep you company. Sometimes they can break you out.\u201d\n\nMara is dramatic, her thoughts, her paintings are dramatic. Falling Under is the kind of book which relies on emotions a lot. Inner monologue is in the foreground. In fact, I think Mara\u2019s thoughts consist most of the novel. At times, it was even a bit too much being inside her head. The ending felt abrupt. I was little surprised how things ended. Yes, all drama regarding her relationships was resolved (maybe), but I felt Mara\u2019s personal issues could\u2019ve been given more attention. You can\u2019t present me with all that drama, make me emotionally invested with Mara, then expect me to believe she\u2019d overcome *all that* that easily? In conclusion, \nFalling Under\n is dark, sexy and hits you right in the feels. You can\u2019t stay indifferent towards Mara\u2019s pain. I loved, LOVED the writing, it\u2019s the best part of the novel. And I really wish more people knew about this amazing and unusual novel.\n\n\u201cWe are fierce and intense and hot, but for the first time, our eyes are honest. Every touch strips us, makes us raw. And what we have always taken from each other by force, we now offer up and then go deeper and find more.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Lucy Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6299196-lucy-morgan", "userReview": "Sometimes, I read a book and want to run off and kidnap the writer. They put these things down in words, so they must understand, so they must be like me. And either that means we are few, and are special, and should stick together...or it means there are many of us, and we should pitch our flagpoles while we can. Build a village.But that sounds a bit creepy :P and I'm not going to kidnap anyone. But this is a touching, implosive and provocative book. Younge-Ullman knows how to write about longing, physicality and what it means to be in pain. She does it with humour and hope, too. This could have been an utterly miserable book, and could have left me wondering what I was meant to do with it, long after I'd finished reading--as similar stories have. But instead, it paid off the way sandpaper tends to: wears you away, leaves you a bit sore, but you find something new beneath when you're done. And it's shiny.I have my own version of the ending.

I loved the author's ability to completely pull me in and then shake me like a rag doll. It is dark, emotional and beautifully written.Honestly, I was not expecting for this book to be what it was; I was thinking it would be a dramatic romance but not a heart tearing, sob inducing, need a glass of wine type book. I did not expect to have an afternoon cry fest when I picked it up. I should not have called for a pizza while finishing the last 15% as I am pretty sure the pizza boy thought I had just learned of a death in the family. It is one of those books that still has me thinking the next day!The book goes back and forth between present and past which worked really well in this case. Mara's parents divorced when she was very young and put her through more than a little girl should have to go through. She doesn't feel particularly loved or nurtured by either parent and starts emotionally detaching herself from situations. Not only is she detached but she doesn't care much about herself. For example, she loses her virginity to a guy she isn't even dating or on a date on because she is mad at her best friend and needs something to give her pain to take that pain away. She falls into some relationships that she shouldn't and ruins relationships that she shouldn't. This girl was so incredibly broken and makes Olivia from The Opportunist look normal at times! She has an intense fear of dying or those around her dying, anxiety and intimacy issues.To give you an idea of how Mara feels about herself, here are her own thoughts, \"If I were painting me, I'd paint a half-person, a woman chased by monsters. They catch at her legs, tear at her clothing, lurk in the alleyways and jump out to grab her as she passes, taking chunks of her and swallowing them whole. She reaches for love, runs towards it, grasps and holds it for a beautiful moment before it turns ugly and drags her down.\"There is no shortage of men in this one. First, there is Caleb who Mara has a relationship with when she is 16 and he is 34. I didn't feel that she loved him but that she liked some of the attention she was getting from him when she really did not have a strong parental figure. Then there is her college boyfriend Lucas; I had a hard time reading into their relationship but of course Mara sabotaged it. Lucas would die while they were dating and this has a huge impact on Mara leading to her issues with death. I do not want to spoil the book for anyone but the circumstances behind his death are shocking and heartbreaking, expect major tears as that story unfolds! Sal was Mara's bed partner turned business partner; he was her escape but not someone she is in love with. The two men that are in her present are Erik and Hugo. Erik is a dark, wounded soul himself. Mara and Erik do not have a real relationship but she uses him as a booty call when she cannot chase the demons away. Things you learn about Erik will shock you as the story goes on! Hugo is a veterinarian who Mara meets in a bar one night. He is very normal and really the complete opposite of Mara. To be honest, I had a hard time determining who Mara loved and if she even has the capability to love the right way.Most people love Hugo from the reviews I have read and I would agree that he is a super nice guy but I am team Erik. I thought what he and Mara had was far deeper, more raw. I felt a passion there that I did not feel with Hugo but I realize that I may be alone in that thought. I am curious to see what \"team\" everyone else is on. Of course, I will not be telling you who she ended up with;)There were a few lighter, funny moments in this story which came during Mara's interactions with Bernadette (Mara's bff) and her inner monologue with her overly crazy self. The first half is a mix of funny and sad but I would say the last 40% of the book is completely heartbreaking. I felt sorry for Mara and wanted to drive her to therapy.My one complaint about the book was how quickly it ended. It was so dark and raw for quite some time and then things were a little brighter and the story was just over. Part of me wants a second book to have some more resolution.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes an emotional read and needs to clean out the tear ducts."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1319648-michael", "userReview": "This book is truly amazing. Heartfelt, raw, sexy, edgy, and also literary, complicated, yet accessible. The journey of the protagonist allows me as the reader to cheer for hope against adversity and personal demons, but also not feel like I'm being cheated into simply becoming a cheerleader: this book isn't all neat and tidy and still makes me think after months of having finished it. It has stayed with me. Perhaps that is in part due to the writing style (half of the book is written in second person so as reader I literally inhabit the skin of Mara), but it is more than that, as the emotional journey is so complex, there are no easy answers. I highly recommend this book because it is like one of those great chats a person has with a best friend; the conversation goes by seemingly so quickly, but the content stays with you, works on your psyche, and, ultimately, changes you. And you're also left wanting more. And that's a good thing."}, {"userName": "Shana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1576351-shana", "userReview": "In Danielle Younge-Ullman's emotionally charged debut novel, Falling Under, readers meet Mara, a twenty-something painter with more than her fair share of problems. In the past, Mara has experienced events and encounters that have left her emotionally scarred and seemingly incabable of having a healthy relationship with anyone. In Mara, Younge-Ullman has created a character that is incredibly raw and vulnerable. Mara's story is told primarily in the first person, with second person narrative interspersed throughout, usually when she is recounting her childhood. There is no omniscient narration here. The reader sees only through Mara's eyes, which means normal physical descriptions of characters and place are few and far between. This only adds to the authenticity of the narrative and frees the reader to step more fully into Mara's life.While Mara was indisputably the star of the story, there were several very well-developed secondary characters, such as her best friend Bernadette, and several of Mara's boyfriends. Her parents were both flawed in their own way. Bitterly divorced since Mara was a child, her father was a mentally ill alcoholic and her mother was cold, distant, and absorbed in her career to the point of neglecting Mara's emotional needs. Still, despite my frustration and disapproval of their parenting choices, they were sympathetic characters for whom I wished eventual redemption. Younge-Ullman has a unique and mesmerizing writing style. It is at once raw and gritty, eloquent and beautiful. Most outstanding is her ability to take the reader inside her character's head and heart, creating a unique and unforgettable reading experience."}, {"userName": "Scarlet", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4684496-scarlet", "userReview": ""}, {"userName": "Katherine Owen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5419924-katherine-owen", "userReview": "June 22, 2015 - I just re-read this one. And still love it. A great read!!Falling Under is amazing contemporary fiction, but to learn that it is a debut novel for Danielle Younge-Ullman makes it even more special. Younge-Ullman does a fantastic job of creating a broken heroine in Mara Foster. The author portrays Mara's dark world where she \"literally\" fears the world, everything in it, and herself, most of all. Younge-Ullman deftly introduces readers to Mara's past through effective narration, but not necessarily predictable flashbacks. No. This talented author just takes you there in first person present tense. I love that! I write in this technique as well and appreciate the dedication and intricacy of it. Younge-Ullman also utilizes first person past tense and second person for some of the flashback narration and effectively conveys Mara's pain so well this way. It's beautifully done.Younge-Ullman keeps the story moving and readers guessing as to what has happened in Mara's past relationships, especially with Lucas, that make her so fearful. Readers will be intrigued with the introduction of Erik and the inexplicable tie in their relationship that makes them so dark and needy of one another. The subtext with her best friend Bernadette is also compelling. And, when Mara meets Hugo, it would appear he's set to be the ultimate hero and rescue her, since he appears to serve so well as the calm to the storm that is Mara. It is easy to discern Hugo's love for her early on, but Younge-Ullman avoids the predictable cliche of having Hugo be the one to save her. No. Younge-Ullman leads readers further into Mara's dark past and allows them to really feel her pain for themselves. Readers will come away enlightened as to why Mara's so bent on self-destruction and, perhaps, even comprehend how it could win out. I'll leave it at that.Falling Under is honest, heartbreaking, at times, yet so satisfying. The writing is amazing and so well done that it reads like a sheet of music. Here's one of my favorite passages: \"I feel his eyes on me. He knows if I\u2019m here, I\u2019ve done everything I can to still the storm inside, to put all the demons back into their boxes and seal the lids. But sometimes they won\u2019t go. Sometimes my ears are full of screaming, and sometimes, like tonight, the voices are mine.\" And this one: \"You haven\u2019t had his lips pressing onto yours, or heard the deep, low whimper that comes from the back of his throat when your lips move in response. You haven\u2019t had him hold your face in his hands and felt him shudder, and no painful, heated ache has rocketed down from your open lips to your tongue and fired along your nerve endings and made you feel like your body was on fire. But now you have. And the world is a different place. Locked together in a tangled embrace, you travel past desire, past time and age and circumstance, past, even, the barriers of body, to a place where you are together, linked in the deepest sense. And for a few timeless moments, you are not alone.\"Danielle Younge-Ullman is a fantastic writer.

The story, and the writing, builds to a fevered pitch of power and depth, as if the writer herself became swept away by her character and finally let loose the emotions so carefully contained . . . as though Younge-Ullman herself is the artist, and brushstroke by brushstroke, the pattern and color and depth are illuminated until the final painting is at last revealed, complete with surprises. This is solid contemporary women\u2019s fiction, and once Younge-Ullman relaxes into her story, the literary quality of her writing shines through.Chapter one begins in second person, whom readers soon find out is young Mara Foster. In Chapter two readers are introduced to adult Mara in first-person voice (and if I had to attach sound to adult Mara, I\u2019d make her voice husky and raw, as if before telling her story, she let out a releasing roar and then coated her throat with honey). In alternating second-person and first-person sections, we follow young Mara as she grows up and inward, and adult Mara as she grows up and outward\u2014and the two meet at the end of the book to create an entire image, complete, replete, but never perfect, for Younge-Ullman understands there is no beauty in perfection.Mara\u2019s parents are a nightmare, and even as Mara grows up, this does not change\u2014a cool and calculating mother, and an alcoholic bi-polarized father\u2014however, Mara sees her parents' flaws, her own flaws, and the flaws of the world around her, with such a sweet and aching clarity that it leaves this reader breathless with want for Mara to find peace. And when Mara picks up her paintbrush and applies it to canvas, there is the feeling of standing on a precipice with her, hoping for the Real Art that Mara hides away (just as she hides herself away) to overtake the constrained geometrical order that she robotically designs\u2014Mara\u2019s art and Mara herself are perfect metaphors for each other. (Younge-Ullman\u2019s descriptions of the art are vibrant and authoritative, and there are sensuous, deliciously sexy love scenes that are masterfully crafted.)As the novel progresses, there is an unfolding, a lifting up and out, a flowering, so that what may at first seem superficial and sparse, turns full and rich and alive\u2014Younge-Ullman has her own character describe her book when she says, \"Can I be rich and sparse at the same time?\" Yes, she can, and she is. Falling Under, and Mara, tugged at my heart and settled in my bones down to the marrow.There are a few \"editorial issues\" I have with Falling Under, one of which are two events I think of as slightly contrived\u2014one alone I may not have, but both together give me a pause\u2014however, to tell what they are would give away surprises, and I don\u2019t want to give anything away.

One will never know, as the ending is purposely vague."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3375358-stephanie", "userReview": "I really loved this book! I loved Mara! She is a woman with so many issues. Because of her past, she's afraid of life, love, happiness....really anything that might blow up in her face and hurt her. She knows this about herself and in spite of it, she still puts herself out there and tries. Sometimes an author does this and it makes the character completely annoying and unlikeable. Danielle Young-Ullman did a great job making Mara a likeable, messed up character that you root for. I loved the ending! It was open ended without complete closure, but that's ok. It gave me something to think about. Like I said, I loved the book. I got it for free, but would have happily paid for it!"}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1410203-stephanie", "userReview": "This was a mediocre book that featured a storyline I have read about a thousand times before but much better. A problem-plagued protagonist (dysfunctional family, dysfunctional relationships, depression, etc.) tries to find her place in the world with her life and her passion: art. I disliked her from the beginning and this lasted throughout the entire book; I found her best friend, Bernadette, to be much more interesting of a character. I also hated the jarring flashbacks. Overall, I thought this entire book was a cliche, but I gave it two stars because I did finish it."}, {"userName": "Jackie Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2536946-jackie-peterson", "userReview": "I couldn't make it through this book. I tried. I really did. But it was so whiny. I just couldn't take it anymore. I got it. She had a tough life, she has issues, she's afraid of a lot of things. Ok. Move the story along please. I just couldn't read one more list of things she thought might go wrong if she left the house. Sorry to all of those who loved this book. I guess I just missed what everyone else seemed to love about it."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1263613-kate", "userReview": "Compelling story of a young woman struggling to surface, toward sanity and love. Sounds heavy but there's a lot of laughter and quirky humor. Particularly good on ongoing warfare between separated parents, and what it's like trying to manage an alcoholic parent. Exceptionally good on the way a young woman might use her sexuality as the best bargaining tool she's got to negotiate her way to independence and adulthood -- and the toll that exerts on her inner life and sense of self."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2608833-sharon", "userReview": "I have the most *severe* book hangover now after reading Falling Under by Danielle Younge-Ullman. I'm giving it FIVE STARS - it's edgy, compelling, painfully real - and it will grab you and not let go. \"I thought I'd step cautiously towards love, walk around it a few times, maybe poke it with a stick before I got too close.\"Peer in to the darkness of this beautiful story, it needs to be read."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93254-michelle", "userReview": "Great book. Stark, beautiful prose and a gritty portrayal of a woman who is a bit of a disaster. The author does a great job of making characters likable who might otherwise not be. And she is expert at weaving the protagonist's back story. I think that's what made the book; understanding where the character came from versus just where she's going. Highly recommended."}], "description": "\"After surviving a turbulent childhood, Mara Foster has finally gained independence and success as a painter.
