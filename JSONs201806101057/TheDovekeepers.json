I\u2019ve literally just finished reading this book and I can\u2019t get my mind to settle down. It\u2019s almost as if I\u2019ve ran a race, my adrenaline is pumping and my heart beating a mile a minute, scenes from the book keep going around and around in my head. My urgent need to tell everyone about this beautifully haunting book is taking over all other thoughts, so I need to get this review out before I explode!Alice Hoffman is the author of Practical Magic and The Red Garden, plus many, many other novels but The Dovekeepers is her first historical fiction work. Hoffman was inspired by a trip to Jerusalem, when she visited a place called Masada, a fortress built by Herod the Great that is situated on top of a large mountain, where a group of nine hundred Jews in the first century CE, who had fled their homelands from the invading Romans converged together to escape the slaughter of their people.The Dovekeepers is the story of four women \u2013 Aziza, the girl-warrior; Shirah, the Witch of Moab; Yael, the lioness; and Revka, the revenging mother \u2013 who came to Masada after their homes and towns were destroyed, each arriving a completely different woman than who they had been before the invasion. They tell the stories of their own life, prior to and including their time in Masada, up to that fateful day and each story is more haunting and profound than the next. Hoffman\u2019s writing is among the most exquisite I have ever read! She has expertly woven a tale of tragedy and hope, hate and love, magic and human nature and I was mesmerized by every word. This book should come with a warning as it has the power to thoroughly enthrall a reader, causing them to block out the world around them completely. My household chores were abandoned, husband and child ignored, I was just absorbed into the pages of this novel that everything else took a backseat to the fascinating story enfolding in front of me. I cried when I finished the novel, not only because of the sad fate of the people of Masada, but because I will miss these four bold and unyielding women. I will carry their story in my heart forever."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Rayment", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3123013-jennifer-rayment", "userReview": "The Good Stuff * I wish I had the words to express how wonderful this book is.

Yet I found the reading to be more of an exercise in frustration and perseverance. The frustration is largely the result of the book's lack of development, which might sound weird to say about a 500+ page novel. It is described on its cover as a story of the siege of Masada, but fans of historical fiction will be sadly disappointed; the historical context is woefully underdeveloped. It happens on the fringes of the women's lives. Fans of fantasy will find the development of the magic weak. I wondered why Hoffman decided to include the magical aspect if she wasn't going to fully commit to it. Finally, fans of strong women protagonists will be seriously pissed off by how flat and unidimensional most of the women come off as. Which brings me to perseverance. The first section of the novel feels like you are trapped in wandering the dessert with the characters, and not it a \"oh the description is so vivid I feel like I'm there\" way but in a \"dear god when will this end\" way. I would have given up if I didn't have to finish this for my book club. I wish I could say that the story picks up, but for me it continued to be really uneven with section that bogged down the story."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "We were no different from the doves above us. We could not speak or cry, but when there was no choice we discovered we could fly. It you want a reason, take this: We yearned for our portion of the sky.\nMasada, the word summons up images, war, Romans, Zealots, slaughter, mass suicide. A place of national pride for some, historical and archaeological controversy for many, a bit of Python mockery to others. On visiting the place itself Alice Hoffman was inspired to wonder about the experience of the women who had lived and died there. The result is The Dovekeepers. She uses the writings of Jewish historian Flavius Josephus as the foundation for her tale. (The Monty Python crew used Josephus\u2019s writings as well, for a very different purpose, in Life of Brian.) The four primary characters meet at Masada, where they are assigned to care for the doves. There are those who might consider this a hardship post, regarding doves as  dirty, disgusting, filthy, and lice-ridden, or as  rats with wings, but they are also a source of fertilizer, meat, eggs, and maybe a bit of hope. No one is designated as the concierge. Alice HoffmanThe four are Yael, Revka, Aziza, and Shirah. Yael is notable for, among other things, her coloring. Her father, Yosef bar Elhanan, is a notorious assassin, a member of the  Sicarii , a blade-minded branch of the Zealot movement. They do unpleasant things to Jews who collaborate with the occupying Romans. He was known not only for his effectiveness with sharp objects, but for his talent at going unnoticed. He did notice, however, that his wife died giving birth to their second child, Yael, and, possessing a mind and heart not nearly as honed as his weapons, he blames her. Thanks, Dad. \nAll the while I was growing up I wondered what it might be like to have a father who wouldn\u2019t turn away from the sight of me, one who told me I was beautiful, even though my hair flamed a strange red color and my skin was sprinkled with earth-toned flecks as though I\u2019d been splattered with mud. I\u2019d heard my father say to another man that these marks were specks of my mother\u2019s blood.\nTheir relationship is, shall we say, strained. Big brother, Amram, however, is the apple of papa\u2019s eye, (I know, shocking) even follows him into the family business. That business involves doing in a Roman general, which gains them the attention of the occupying force and the family is forced to beat a hasty exodus from Jerusalem. They team up with another Sicarii family, headed by Jachim ben Simon. Things get complicated. They all endure a trial by heat, sand and misery on their trek, offering witness to others\u2019 tales of sundry Roman atrocities as well. It is a road of self-discovery for Yael, and she arrives at Masada much changed from who she was when she had set out.Rachel Broshahan as Yael - from CBSRevka had a nice family. Hubby was a baker. Her daughter was married to a nice studious young man. They had two boys. Romans sacked their town, murdering Revka\u2019s husband while slaughtering anyone within reach. Revka is forced to become a refugee. Further atrocities are visited on her family. While she gets a measure of revenge on the latest evil-doers, she darkens her own soul. Her grandchildren have become mute and her nice-young-man of a son-in-law has become a psycho warrior. Aziza and her mother were sexually assaulted when Aziza was still a child. Mom decided to raise her as a boy to reduce the likelihood of that happening again. She becomes a bad-ass warrior. Her brother not so much. There is a scene that could have been pulled from Robin Hood in which Aziza demonstrates her proficiency with a bow and arrow. Also gawjuss. Think Xena, at least I did. (you sprouts out there might conjure Katniss) Kathryn Prescott as Aziza - from CBSLast and definitely not least is Shirah. A witchy sort, with a book of magic spells, great hair and ravishing beauty. She comes from a line of women in a particular line of work, but her mother sent her away from their home in Alexandria when she was young, as an anti-them pogrom was going on, to stay with relations in Jerusalem. Things do not go well for her there. She meets The One, but there is a mess with him being already married, and not up to standing up to his parents, and her being, oh, twelve. She later finds someone with whom to share a home, pops out a few progeny, but is now a single mom in Masada, doing the odd spell to help female residents with this and that, and still looking up to the goddess Ashtoreth for her main religious sustenance. But what\u2019s the deal with her and the hunky head of the Masada warriors, Eleazar Ben Ya'ir? And what\u2019s up with his seriously creepy wife?Cote de Pablo as Shirah - from CBSSo that\u2019s the four. We know (you know, right?) that things do not go well for the residents of Club Masada. The story is in tracking the progress of the place\u2019s demise and how the four got there, and how they cope with the stresses that are steadily building. We are also given a bit of a tour, and get a sense of place beyond the stick figure general notion.Hoffman definitely has an inclination towards incorporating history into her work, whether of the maritime sort in Blackbird House or a bit of Transcendentalism in The Red Garden. She is also fond of incorporating dollops of magic into her tales, sometimes more than a little. She usually tells tales of women who are forced to cope with challenging circumstances. And she is quite fond of fairy tales. It will come as no shock that this novel is very much in keeping with her previous work. What makes it different is its ambition, scope, and length. It is not a huge book, at 500 pages or so, but is bulkier than her previous work.First, and probably most important, it is an engaging read. Her main characters are interesting, all strong in their way, and worth finding out about. The story moves along at a decent pace, most of the time. Place is of obviously central import and is given star treatment. I would not say that you could matter-transmit yourself to the fort and know your way around, but you might see places that look familiar and wonder how you knew about them. Hoffman mixes martial material of different flavors, blending some warriors in combat with the more appalling laying waste of defenseless civilians by armed sorts from both sides. There is romantic entanglement aplenty, but my guy-genes did not feel much inclination to generate spew. It all worked pretty well. She may have overdone it a bit with her imagery, IMHO. Yael, in particular, is associated with, among other things, a Flaming Tree image. Red hair, get it? There are other bits of significance associated with this, but it seemed to me that it was popping up like one of those birthday candles that won\u2019t go out. Yael is also associated with lions, in various guises, a love interest, an encounter with a feline or two in the desert, a kittie held captive by the occupying army. As a host to six of the creatures, I know that, however much we may love and be fascinated by them, sometimes you need to step back a bit. Maybe it is just that in a longer book there are more mentions than one is used to from Hoffman, who knows her way around imagery. I do not recall feeling bugged by other such strands. Watch for image streams relating to serpents and boids, sorry, birds (I am from Brooklyn, after all) Hoffman associates some elemental aspects with her characters, which seemed very fairy-tale-ish and ok. Shirah is associated with water, for example, and that aspect was used in moderation and worked quite well. Magic most definitely plays a part here. Spells are cast and have the expected impact. Of course some of what works is an expert\u2019s knowledge of science, and that seems like magic at times. It is suggested that one character\u2019s cloak has a feature may make it a likely ancestor of a similar garment used in Hogwarts. One expects magic in AH\u2019s novels. This is all good. For her historical basis, Hoffman relies on the writings of Flavius Josephus. Here we get into a bit of controversy. The tale of mass suicide that is Masada appears not to have a particularly strong foundation in archaeological research. It was fluffed at a time when it served well as a symbol of Israeli determination and nationhood. Evidence that proves that the events Josephus describes actually occurred is less than entirely persuasive. While there are certainly elements of Josephus\u2019s tale that have a basis in reality, others might constitute a bit of playing to his audience. We all have our national myths. Think George Washington and the Cherry Tree, Paul Revere\u2019s ride, WMDs in Iraq. I do not fault Hoffman for centering her tale around a historical event that is less than universally accepted. Myth is what she does. And she has done an outstanding job with this one. Whether one sees the source material as ancient history or a mythologization of a less exceptional reality, the story she spins around that core is a compelling one. I have only read a handful of Alice Hoffman\u2019s adult books, so cannot claim a deep knowledge of her oeuvre. But I would put my shekels on The Dovekeepers being the crowning achievement of her career. (One might say it is the feather in her literary cap. I wouldn\u2019t, but some might.)Review posted \u2013 3/28/15Pub Date \u2013 10/4/11This review is also posted at Cootsreviews.com=============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author\u2019s personal and FB pagesHere is a  reading guide from Hoffman\u2019s siteThe CBS mini-series is due any day now.

Devotees will recognize the strong women with unusual, even magical abilities. What's new is the historical setting and time---the fortress of Masada in the year 70 CE. Also, Hoffman's language struck me as different in this book. I think whether or not readers like this book will hinge on their reaction to the language Hoffman uses to recreate the world of her women. I loved the level of detail. I felt the sea salt in my hair, the rocks pricking my bare feet, the sun beating mercilessly on my head. I tasted the saltiness of the olive crop. I realized how central religious beliefs were to how the women lived their daily lives, and how gender affected their choices. I understood when they chose to break the rules and empathized at the price they paid. One of the themes of this story is the value of words; their meaning and use are important to the characters. Words are cited as the first thing created by God. Hoffman uses this novel to give words to the women of the time, to let their voices be heard. Words can be spoken or written. This book did for me what I love about books---it used the written word to create a world for me as real as the one I'm living in now."}, {"userName": "Christina White", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4349493-christina-white", "userReview": "Alice Hoffman brought me back in time and I enjoyed learning about what life was like in 70 C.E. The writing was beautiful and at times poetic. I like my poetry in short doses though and after two hundred pages of lyrical prose I was ready to move on with the story. I liked the book, in fact I was swept away in the lives of the brave women it was about. Revka, Aziza, Shirah and Yael were strong women who lived amazing lives and were the only survivors of the Masada massacre. Unfortunately, the parts of the story that I first found to be so interesting started to bore me. The amount of detail the author put into describing religious beliefs and rituals made the story drag. I felt like I only needed to read about the steps to prepare one's body for death only once. Instead, the author felt like she had to pound the information into my skull again and again. After a while that is how I felt.... like the author was pounding me upside the head with her overly written book. Death by poetry.

The plot was terrible; it had no real development or drive. In reality, it barely existed at all. The story just followed the lives of some rather mundane characters. There was little to keep me reading. They weren\u2019t really striving for anything, beyond survival; thus, I found myself getting quite bored with their stories. They just weren\u2019t very remarkable. The historical detail was minimal, and the random magic elements that were worked in the plot were just so pointless that they might as well have been taken out. I was rather annoyed.I would even go as far to say that this wasn\u2019t really historical fiction. Well, at least not in the traditional sense. The author has evoked the era well in terms of the social aspects she portrayed. The Roman Empire\u2019s brutality can be seen in the stories; they are ignorant to ways that are not their own. They are quick to supress and control. But, in terms of the huge political events, the ones that change governments and shape nations, this was hugely underdeveloped. It was barely portrayed at all; it wasn\u2019t the focus of the story, the characters were. So, it remained forever in the background. This was more a chronicling of their lives rather than a portrayal of real historical detail. As a huge fan of historical fiction, I was incomparably disappointed because there was so little history involved. The cover was very missleading. The prose was heavily descriptive. It was massively convoluted in this. The desert scenes were painstakingly arduous in their perpetuity. They just didn\u2019t seem to end. The dessert was clearly suggestive of the character\u2019s situation; they were hopeless and despairing like the far reaching dry dunes. This is great, though I don\u2019t need to be bombarded with the constant comparison. Then, at one point, she gives a ridiculously long section over to describing the wind. I mean the\u2026wind. Great\u2026. I get it. It\u2019s the fucking wind. This needed some elements of subtlety in the writing, and a stripping back of its overworked imagery. I\u2019d just had enough of hearing about the desert, and it\u2019s amazingly exciting wind, come the tenth time it was described. Then there are the characters themselves. I hated them. I hated them all, every last one of them. Well, except for the goat in the first part. I quite liked the goat. That says it all. When the goat is your favourite character in the novel, then you know that you hate it. Not that I\u2019m against goats, but when I read a book I hope for something more than a goat that I can sympathise with. She did have it tough though, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be dragged along with Hoffman\u2019s characters. Well, that kind of happened when I read this excruciating novel, but not in the literal sense.

With only a couple of exceptions, every GR friend who read it rated it very highly. Writers Toni Morrison and Wally Lamb praised it as well. So what\u2019s up with me? I offer up my thoughts for those very few of you who also struggled.I ended up feeling like many of the Jews wandering in the desert for forty years, except for me it was forty years of five hundred pages.

I was definitely feeling very ungrateful and unappreciative by the halfway mark.While the author\u2019s prose usually works its magic on me, in this case it was overwrought in my opinion. I think it got it its own way. Weaving a tale around the personal stories of four women and how they came to be at Masada was promising fiction. However they all spoke with the same esoterically flowered speech to the point of reading exhaustion. Since the ending of this historical event was known and would be no surprise reveal, it was all about the journey getting there. It became necessary for me to break and read other books in order to finish.

In fact, one evening my wife looked at the book while I was reading in bed and said: \"You're reading Alice Hoffman? I've read Alice Hoffman. But you don't read Alice Hoffman!\"And so I DID read Alice Hoffman and I liked Alice Hoffman. This is a very good book. It's real deep and very weighty. \"Dovekeepers\" orbits around the real life events of the early 70s A.D. in ancient Judea. Rome was large and in charge and in the midst of shattering a Judean rebellion (seen commemorated in the famous Arch of Titus in the Roman Forum only a few hundred yards from the Colosseum in Italy). Several hundred Jews fled Jerusalem to the desert near the Dead Sea and moved into the former mountain fortress of King Herod at Masada. While the proud Jewish rebels held off a Roman legion for several years, Rome ultimately prevailed and all but two women and five children killed themselves rather than allow themselves to be overrun.Hoffman's novel follows the lives of four women who all find themselves on Masada. Each woman has a dedicated 100-150 pages that weave in and out of each other\u2019s stories with the collective whole building a comprehensive picture of their mutual plight. The stories connect the women together in ways that are obvious and follow the primary arc of the novel, but also in ways that are surprising and poignantly fulfilling. The connections build and develop on many levels: physically, emotionally, and symbolically. The book is full of characters who are broken and hurt; affected by some deep trauma catalyzed by the Roman attacks on Jerusalem; driving each, by their own will or otherwise, to the fortress in the desert. One of Hoffman\u2019s women is Yael, a deeply fractured and self actualizing individual who sums up the disparate journeys that brought the women to Masada: \"We came like doves across the desert. In a time when there was nothing but death, we were grateful for anything, and most grateful of all when we awoke to another day.\"You'll feel the weight of each character\u2019s pain and sorrow increase as the novel progresses. There are few happy endings. Hoffman's themes cover the gamut from fate and destiny, to religion and love, and the depths of devotion. Faith is a thread that runs throughout Hoffman's carefully woven tapestry. It's not just a religious entity, but something that binds individuals, family units, as well as the entire rebel community. In Revka, Hoffman ponders the rebel Jews: \"If we lost our faith, we would become like the clouds that swell across the western sky when the wind pushes them into the desert promising rain but empty inside.\" It's through Revka also that Hoffman finally (about half-way through he book) provides a heart-wrenchingly warm and genuinely surprising treat at the end of her particular novella. For the first time the furrow on my brow melted into a smile on my face (note: it didn\u2019t last very long). Hoffman's Judean world is one of religion and tradition, of myth and magic: a world where everything in it has significance...symbolic or real. Some vignettes read almost as something out of a fantasy novel, but there's no melodrama to their weight.In looking for a good way to summarize the books' tone, I found a couple of strong quotes. This first comes from Shirah, \u2018The Witch of Moab\u2019: \"Being human means losing everything we love best in the world. But would you ask to be anything else?\" This second is from Revka: \"...our waking life is formed by our sorrow. \" In each character is anchored a heavy weight. In this misogynistic society, few men come across in a truly positive light. Though Hoffman writes very sparingly, in her few words, she's able to expresses a multiplicity of ideas and thoughts. Characters are never solely what they seem to be and there is very little that is purely black or white. Hoffman\u2019s world is filled with shades of gray. This book is going to resonate strongly for a lot of readers. It may be a bit polarizing because of its very serious nature. But as a first time reader of Hoffman, and a male, I feel fuller for having read this novel. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Carole", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8276857-carole", "userReview": "This is a work of historical fiction. The story is based on the Roman attack on the fortress at Masada in 73 A.D. and the resulting mass suicide. Since I have visited this site in present-day Israel, I was interested in reading a novel based on this event.In terms of the history, Hoffman has done an admirable job of researching and narrating the events at Masada. She describes the time, place and culture of the ancient Hebrews with great detail.However, in terms of the fictional part of the novel, she does not do such an admirable job. The plot is pure suds: dysfunctional families, infidelity, far-fetched coincidence, secret love affairs and emotional conflict galore. The book is far too long (500 pages) and seemed even longer due to the tedious writing style. The story is told from the point of view of four different characters. I was having a hard time keeping them straight until I realized that the reason was that they all had the same voice. What this book needed was a good editor who is not intimidated by Hoffman's status as a best-selling author. Preferably an editor with a big pair of scissors who would cut out at least 100 pages. And maybe an editor who would have the courage to point out that a story cannot be told in the first person by a dead character. So, mostly two stars but I gave it three because of the history."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Judea AD 70 ...\"The First Jewish-Roman War\"In the years after the destruction of the second temple, approx. 900 Jewish rebels and their families fled Jerusalem and took refuge in the fortress of Masada in the Judean desert. Women Dovekeeper's: collecting birds eggs, gathering droppings to ferlise the fortress's orchard's. These women tending to the Masada's dovecotes, formed a small community within a larger one. They each bring their conflicts with them. They live with guilt, grief, loss, family conflicts, difficult births, jealous conflicts, and secrets. These women express sexual freedom - care about gender equality, and emancipation. Some of these women- take lovers, have babies, steal babies, cast spells. There are mother/daughter issues. Father/daughter issues. Sibling issues. Friendship issues... Jewish struggles.......Revka watched her daughter be raped and murdered by a Roman soldier. Her husband was also murdered. She has two grandsons --whom are her life. ...Yael's mother died during childbirth. Her father, (a political assassin), treated her awful --as if she were to blame. She was close to her brother Amram...(she protected him when they were little...as Amram was a sensitive boy). Yet Amram followed his father's footsteps --became a powerful assassin, himself as a young man.Yael's closest friend ---is her brother, Amram! --(even though they go long periods of being separated). The Assassin, Simon, --(who trains Amram to be an assassin) ---later becomes Yael's lover ---(but so much more --I can't give all the details away) ...Shirah is has two daughters: Aziza & Nahara. Shirah is considered the medicine woman --yet is also accused of witchcraft. ---\"Witch of Moab\". She's a feminist heroine in many ways -- using her power to help other women who are in need. ...Aziza was raised as a boy and as a warrior -- 'until' the age of 16 --when she rebels. She meets Amram....and from that day forward --she wants to be 'a girl' again. She and Amram fall in love. (no love is 'easy' in this story)...Channa is the barren wife of a character based on the real-life leader of Jewish rebels.Here are a couple lines to ponder........1) Yael speaking: \"As I grew, I was quiet and well behaved. I asked for nothing, and that was exactly what I received. If I was clever, I tried not to show it. If I was injured, I kept my wounds to myself. I turned away whenever I saw other girls with their fathers, for mine did not wish to be seen with me.\" 2) Shirah speaking: \"They say that a woman who practices magic is a witch, and that every witch derives her power from the earth. There was a great seer who advised that, should a man hold a witch in the air, he could then cut off her powers, thereby making her helpless. But such an attempt would have no effect on me. My strength came from water, my talents buoyed by the river. On the day I swam in the Nile and saw my fate in the ink blue depths, my mother told me that I would have powers of my own, as she did. But there was a warning she gave me as well: If I were ever to journey too far from the water, I would lose my power and my life. I must keep my head and not give in to desire, for desire is what is what causes women to drown.\"This is a historical 'saga-drama'. Characters are well developed...Story is easy to follow...Reading is fast....once the reader 'dives' in!I fully enjoyed this book....

When the story's moving, it engages. Otherwise, it's stagnant and annoying.This book has the nasty whiff of Anita Diamont: phony historicity; extraneous research thrown in because she has it, not because it fits; names of objects (e.g.: \"birthing stool\") that are never explained (probably because the author is clueless about its use); predictable outcomes (of course Yael will fall in love with the enslaved legionnaire); repetitive themes and phrases, ponderous and heavy-handed symbols, and and the author's inflated sense of herself. Hoffman's ludicrous use of Hebrew terms, which she then must explain, stops the forward movement of the narrative in its tracks time and again. Why? Do we need to know that \"tanur\" is Hebrew for \"oven?\" And for all her purported familiarity with Jewish custom and ritual, she abuses the name of God, using \"Adonai\" over and over again, when that's a sacred name to be used only in prayer. She also talks about a flaxen garment. But flax is not kosher. It's \"shatnez,\" prohibited from use, because it's made of the forbidden combination of linen and wool. All in all, a lot of hot air. I'm only half-way through the book, but it's pretty certain that a novel that gets this far with these glaring flaws will be unable to redeem itself. This book got rave reviews from Toni Morrison, Jodi Picoult, and Wally Lamb. Note that not one of these critics is Jewish. Each probably appreciated \"learning\" so much Jewish history from Hoffman. I say go back to Josephus or Yigal Yadin, two of Hoffman's major sources. And if you want an author who can teach through fiction, choose an author who isn't didactic. And one whose literary style has more sophistication than 60s soap operas.Final note:I finished the book, which became a page-turner as the end approached. Would I have been as engrossed if I didn't know how the Masada story ended? I'll never know. Given that I did know the outline, it was satisfying to read the details. However fictitious, those details were convincing. Still, all in all, I think the book lacked editorial rigor. By the end, I recognized that the prevalence of witchcraft in the story may have been warranted. But if it is, that should have been made clear from the outset. Hoffman is eager to show off her learning; why doesn't she teach us from the get-go that witchcraft was commonly practiced (if it was) and that featuring spells and conjurings isn't simply the author's predilection? Long before the final chapters, I'd come to the conclusion that Hoffman's emphasis on mystical beliefs and magical practices was simply an indication of her tastes; that she was catering to a low and unworthy common denominator. I started off giving the book one star. Once I finished, and because she made the conclusion so gripping, I gave it two. But it was still so annoying that I went back to one star. What a pity she squandered such valuable research and missed the opportunity to do justice to the important historical and cultural event: the story of Massada."}, {"userName": "Mandy R", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8554652-mandy-r", "userReview": "The only reason I would give this book 2 Stars is due to the amount of research that Alice Hoffman had obviously put into this novel, which I certainly appreciated.

Moving toward the setting of the sun, which the Greeks believed rode across the sky every day in a fiery chariot driven by Helios Apollo, I carried with me, in my canvas Land\u2019s End tote bag, cheese made from the cultured milk of the cows we raise here in Wisconsin and crackers woven from wheat that grew on the Great Plains farther to the west. I had heard the decree during our month of Sivan, when the fragrant white lilies blossom, that in the month of Tammuz, when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky and children leave school, our group of women that gathers every month to enjoy each other\u2019s society and discuss literature would read Alice Hoffman\u2019s bestseller, The Dovekeepers. Though I enjoy our monthly gatherings, my heart was filled with sorrow as I approached Lynda\u2019s chamber and contemplated the strife that would ensue when I disclosed my true feelings about the book to Lynda and the others. My grievances were myriad. I am astonished that the writer does not appear to possess the knowledge of how to Show Not Tell. I have long disagreed with writers who believe they can make an unconvincing character more \u201crelatable\u201d if only they narrate their stories in the first person. Even more agonizing is the use of multiple first person narrators who all speak in the same voice, especially when they all affect a pompous, grandiloquent voice as if to remind the reader that the writer has set the story in The Holy Land during Biblical times. People have described Hoffman\u2019s language as \u201cpoetic\u201d or \u201ccrafted\u201d and remarked at her exhaustive historical research. One might marvel at her ability to sustain such a style for hundreds and hundreds of pages. Yet I wearied of it, and as I was to learn, so did Lynda and the rest of my sister book-lovers. When I read a book, I do not wish to be so distracted by writing that doesn\u2019t advance the story, by forced similes and historical details haphazardly sprinkled into the text, that I lose interest in the characters or what happens to them. Only a lively, fascinating plot about believable, likeable people, or nonfiction accounts of important events, can keep me engaged in spite of a pedantic writing style. A tedious, obviously fantastical story, especially one that speculates about real historical figures or attributes anachronistic values to major players, cannot overcome the weaknesses of a book seemingly written not to edify or entertain but to make the author look clever."}, {"userName": "Tania", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6450088-tania", "userReview": "The desire for Jerusalem was a fire that could not be quenched.

This was definitely the case with The Dovekeepers, although it touched me deeply, I can't explain exactly why and I'm not sure who I would recommend it to. There's many reasons why I should not have loved this book as I did. Although the writing is exquisitely beautiful, it is not an easy-read. The story is told using a first-person point of view, so it focuses more on observation than on action. It's more about the character's thoughts than anything else. The characters are complex, and with the exception of Revka, they are not always easy to like. The author mixes religion with sorcery, which is also not everyone's cup of tea. But despite, or maybe because of all of the above reasons I fell in love this book. I am so glad I got to know these four characters and this bit of history.

In 70 C.E., nine hundred Jews held out for months against armies of Romans on Masada, a mountain in the Judean desert. According to the ancient historian Josephus, two women and five children survived. Based on this tragic and iconic event, Hoffman's novel is a spellbinding tale of four extraordinarily bold, resourceful and sensuous women, each of whom has come to Masada by a different path. Yael's mother died in childbirth, and her father, an expert assassin, never forgave her for that death. Revka, a village baker's wife, watched the horrifically brutal murder of her daughter by Roman soldiers; she brings to Masada her young grandsons, rendered mute by what they have witnessed. Aziza is a warrior's daughter, raised as a boy, a fearless rider and an expert marksman who finds passions with a fellow soldier. Shirah, born in Alexandria, is wise in the ways of ancient magic and medicine, a woman with uncanny insight and power. The lives of these four complex and fiercely independent women intersect in the desperate days of the siege.

I'm picky, so it's usually only a few. In December 2011, The Dovekeepers was one of two titles that I wrote down. I'm usually pleased by these choices, recommended by other authors or academics, but rarely am I transported the way that I was upon reading this magical book.Other reviewers have ably described the plotline, so I won't go into it here. Suffice it to say that the novel concerns four women who find themselves in the fortress of Masada after the sack of Jerusalem by the Romans. Through the eyes of these four women, Hoffman weaves an extraordinarily luminous tale, breathing life into ancient Judaea and its people, their customs, religion and habits. We learn much about the Jewish religion, the practices of witchcraft and herblore, the tending of crops and livestock, and the claustrophobia of living in an isolated fortress in the desert.As most of you know, the story of Masada was a tragic one. As such, this book is full of harrowing and haunting images - particularly the final pages, which constantly had me in tears. Yet it is also full of the love that mothers have for their children, lovers have for each other, and of the deep bonds of comradeship that bring men to fight together to the end. I was entranced from the first page by Hoffman's wonderful writing. As the pages flew by, I found myself counting how many I had left until the end - because I desperately did not want to finish it. For me, that is a rare occurrence, and the mark of a great book and a great writer. Bravo, Alice Hoffman!Although this novel was published in 2011, I read it in 2012.

The Dovekeepers is Alice Hoffman\u2019s masterpiece.My Review:I have read a lot of novels about ancient Jerusalem during this era but I must begin this particular review with one word \u2013 WOW!! I was completely entranced with Alice Hoffman\u2019s The Dovekeepers which took place during the Roman siege during the first century abbreviated as C.E. which stands for Common Era. Common Era refers to the years counting forward from the birth of Jesus. C.E. has mostly replaced the old use of A.D. in an effort to appease non-theological references and non-believers. The use of Common Era is a more accepted practice now.The Jewish war was written around 75 C.E. by a man named Flavius Josephus who was a Jewish historian.Masada was a desert fortress situated at the top of a rock cliff at the western end of the Judean Desert and overlooking the Dead Sea. Masada is the Hebrew word for fortress.Hoffman delivers a breathtaking account of the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple in 70 C.E. In 73 C.E. the Roman Governor Flavius Silva marched against Masada with the Tenth Legion. The Romans quickly built camps at the base of Masada in preparation to lay siege to it. They built massive walls and constructed a rampart, then built a huge ramp, moved the battering ram up the ramp and breached the wall of the fortress.The story is told through the voices of four different women: Yael, Revka, Aziza and Shirah. Each of these women had secrets about where they came from, who they are, who their fathers were, and who they love. Each of the women\u2019s stories bound them together throughout the novel emotionally and symbolically. The change in each woman\u2019s story flowed effortlessly and leant to the dynamic retelling of this sad and tragic period in history. The dramatic end to this story will rip your heart out and leave tear-stains on your pages as you turn them. The title The Dovekeepers has a symbolic meaning throughout the story. I\u2019ve read a lot of Hoffman\u2019s work and I believe this to be her very best. I believe this will become a classic in the future and a novel that will be talked about in book groups, people\u2019s living rooms, in the news and will be a bestseller. I for sure will be touting the merits of this book to anyone and everyone who will listen. Kudos to you Ms. Hoffman!"}], "description": "Over five years in the writing, The Dovekeepers is Alice Hoffman's most ambitious and mesmerizing novel, a tour de force of imagination and research, set in ancient Israel.In 70 C.E., nine hundred Jews held out for months against armies of Romans on Masada, a mountain in the Judean desert. According to the ancient historian Josephus, two women and five children survived. Based on this tragic and iconic event, Hoffman's novel is a spellbinding tale of four extraordinarily bold, resourceful, and sensuous women, each of whom has come to Masada by a different path. Yael's mother died in childbirth, and her father, an expert assassin, never forgave her for that death. Revka, a village baker's wife, watched the horrifically brutal murder of her daughter by Roman soldiers; she brings to Masada her young grandsons, rendered mute by what they have witnessed. Aziza is a warrior's daughter, raised as a boy, a fearless rider and an expert marksman who finds passion with a fellow soldier. Shirah, born in Alexandria, is wise in the ways of ancient magic and medicine, a woman with uncanny insight and power. The lives of these four complex and fiercely independent women intersect in the desperate days of the siege. All are dovekeepers, and all are also keeping secrets - about who they are, where they come from, who fathered them, and whom they love.", "title": "The Dovekeepers", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10950924-the-dovekeepers", "average": 4.03, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1306253903l/10950924.jpg", "reviews": 7394, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3502.Alice_Hoffman", "name": "Alice Hoffman"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "Magical Realism"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10950924-the-dovekeepers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10950925-the-dovekeepers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14290245-the-dovekeepers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22896.Practical_Magic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5159.Here_on_Earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23492741-the-marriage-of-opposites", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18144053-the-museum-of-extraordinary-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34037113-the-rules-of-magic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
