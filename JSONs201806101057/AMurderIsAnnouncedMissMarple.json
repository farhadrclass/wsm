Is it possible? Yes. Does it happen? You'll just have to read it. Christie at her best... love her stories. love the concept. Well-written. I'm on a kick to go back and read all the Poirot's and Marple's this year! The best part about this one is the murder takes forever to happen... and you wonder what the real mystery is for so long. I can imagine watching the clock waiting but not knowing what to do. Very inside one's head to figure this one out!\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.

It's just not possible. She's like a magician who tells an audience that she's going to make a coin disappear and reappear. The coin disappears, and she tells you to watch her right hand. You, who have seen magic shows before, think \"Aha! Misdirection! I'll watch her left hand, and then I'll see how the trick is done.\" So you're watching her left hand, and everyone else is watching her right hand, and then suddenly the coin appears out of nowhere and no one has any idea how she did that. Meanwhile the assistant, who you've completely forgotten about, has just transformed into a dog and then your brain explodes. That's what reading a good Agatha Christie book is like. This is one of the good ones. My favorite Christie stories are the ones where multiple people get murdered. A murder occurs, people start looking for the killer, and then BAM somebody else is found dead and you realize that whoever the killer is he/she is fucking nuts and you don't know who's going to die next. It adds a great deal of tension and urgency to the story, and I love it. Now I have two complaints, one serious and one absurd, that contributed to this book's four-instead-of-five star rating. The serious: Miss Marple is more present in this book than she was in The Body in the Library, but she still keeps to the sidelines a lot and it's frustrating. She's not even mentioned by name until page 95, and I think it'd be nice if she could solve a mystery on her own instead of waiting for the police to invite her into their Boys Only Mystery Solving Clubhouse. The absurd: Quotes like this, when the police are discussing the inhabitants of the village where the murder took place: \"'Nice old pussies and retired colonels. ...Lord, I wish I had my own particular old pussy here. Wouldn't she like to get her nice ladylike teeth into this?''Who's your own particular pussy, Henry? An aunt?'\"Okay. I understand that Agatha Christie's definition of \"pussy\" is vastly different from my own. But this is like that part in Arrested Development where they actually got a character to call someone a pussy without it being censored, because they claimed it was a British term for a nice person. We all know what they're really doing, and that's delighting in being able to use that word freely on TV. (Speaking of Arrested Development, you should all be proud of me for resisting the urge to toss out an \"It's an illusion!\" reference during that magician analogy I made up there. You're welcome.) Once would be understandable, and a sign that my dirty mind has gone too far, but then it happens again: \"'Ye gods and little fishes,' said Sir Henry, 'can it be? George, it's my own particular, one and only, four-starred pussy. The super pussy of all old pussies.'\"Oh come on, Christie. Now you're just messing with me. \""}, {"userName": "Melindam", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36434323-melindam", "userReview": "I prefer Poirot-novels to Marple ones, but this book has always been in the Top 5 on my Agatha Christie favourites list. This time I actually put myself the question \"why\". It is NOT because of the investigation or the solution of the crime, even though it is very well done in the classic Agatha Christie style: red herrings are there to lead you astray; real clues are hidden in plain sight and yet elude you completely. The answer is characterization, which is perfect: concise and revealing. Dame Agatha depicts her characters without mercy (everyone has motive/potential/opportunity to commit murder) and yet with humour & a deep understanding (people are the same everywhere: we are all human with faults and foibles). This insight into characters as well as the milieu they are placed in reminds me a bit of Jane Austen and what she wrote to her niece Anna on writing novels: \u201c3 or 4 Families in a Country village is the very thing to work on\u201d. Also a quote from Elizabeth Bennet comes to mind: \u201cFollies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.\u201d So this mixture of Jane Austen & Agatha Christie which delights me in this particular novel."}, {"userName": "Carol. ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol", "userReview": "Taken from my blog post: https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2014/...I grew up on Christie. At the time, I was limited to whatever my local library branch physically had on the shelves, so it took awhile to work my way through her bibliography, and even now, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve read all of her books. There was that pesky problem of British and American editions with separate titles, leaving me hopelessly confused about what I\u2019ve read. Thankfully, A Murder is Announced had the same title in both editions, which might be why I remember it so well. It might also be because it is an amazingly well written with a nicely tricky mystery.Oh, Letty! A murder has been announced in the personals section of the local gazette. You kids may not know this, but that\u2019s like Craigslist in print form. And game murder mysteries were old-fashioned acted-out parties where guests solved the mystery. That\u2019s why the residents of the village of Chipping Cleghorn assume they are being invited. Nonetheless, a newspaper invite bit informal, so they contrive excuses to drop by Letitia Blacklock\u2019s home. As they\u2019re settled in, having a smoke and a sherry, a masked man holds them up. The lights go out. Shots echo in the dark room. When someone flips a light, the unknown masked intruder is dead. The police are prone to write it off as a burglary gone bad, except Inspector Craddock can\u2019t quite let it go. His godfather points him in the direction of the little old ladies of the case, citing his own Miss Marple as an example. Before long, we meet her in person.Christie is in peak form here, displaying skill in every aspect of writing, balanced with atmosphere, character, mystery and philosophy, with not an excess word present. Oh sure, had Christie Sandersonized it, it could have been far beyond its 300 pages, filled with details about the village foliage or the design of their dresses. Except those details are there, and rarely does she tell us; we discover it in clever word choice or implicit in dialogue. This may be why A Murder is Announced is one of her better mysteries; though she provides a number of clues and red herrings, her details are so sparse that careful reading is needed. Come to think of it, Sanderson presents a symphony in a book, while Christie is the soloist, the violin virtuoso, each note given star attention.Clues are dropped. I wish I could give an opinion on the mystery, but the truth is, I\u2019ve read this enough times that I remembered the solution, just not the reasoning. Still, astute minds in the Goodreads Agatha Christie Lovers group pointed out Dame Agatha was dropping subtle clues from the beginning, along with plenty of red herrings.Characterization is amazing. Scant descriptors, and yet every utterance hints at character. Check this brief oratory by an elderly gardener when being questioned:\u201c\u2018I\u2019ve no idea,\u2019 said Craddock. \u2018I suppose this hold-up caused a lot of talk?\u2019\u201cThat it did. What\u2019s us coming to? That\u2019s what Ned Barker said. Comes of going to the pictures so much, he said. But Tom Riley, he says it comes of letting these furriners run about loose. And depend on it, he says, that girl that cooks up there for Miss Blacklock and \u2018as such a nasty temper\u2013she\u2019s in it, he said. She\u2019s a Communist or worse, he says, and we don\u2019t like that sort \u2018ere.\u2019\u201cAll he does is talk, and with every sentence, Christie gives us the picture of the small town, the gossip, the dynamic between the young and the old, the long-time residents and the foreigners\u2013or furriners, as he says. And so much about the man himself\u2013what he chooses to share with police, his education, his speech pattern, his peer group. Clever, clever.The sly humor is a nice touch for an adult read\u2013I\u2019m not sure I picked up on it when I was younger.\u201c\u2018And it isn\u2019t,\u2019 pursued Mrs. Swettenham, \u2018as though you were a worker. You don\u2019t do any work at all.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s not in the least true,\u2019 said Edmund indignantly. \u2018I\u2019m writing a book.\u2019\u2018I meant real work,\u2019 said Mrs. Swettenham.\u201cBut I have no doubt that it was a great deal of work indeed, to craft a book that provides excellent entertainment, and yet such insight into the residents of a small English town. An enjoyable trip down memory lane that gives me all new appreciation for her skill."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "A Murder is Announced (Miss Marple #5), first published in the UK by the Collins Crim Club in June 1950.Characters: Miss Jane Marple, the Inspector and vicar's wife Bunch, Swiss hotel clerk Rudi, Miss Letitia Blackstone houses scatty Dora, Cousins Julia and Patrick, gardener widow Phillipa, and paranoid cook Mitzi.Abstract: Villagers expect a fun game after a Gazette announcement of murder, but when lights flash off, shots ring out, and a masked burglar falls dead, the Inspector and vicar's wife Bunch call in expert Miss Jane Marple.

It is set in the small village of Chipping Cleghorn, which is not unlike St Mary Mead, with its cast of local characters and, of course, a local newspaper \u2013 which is delivered every Friday. On Friday, October 29th, the paper is perused by the villagers, who discover an odd message in the Personal column: \u201cA Murder is Announced and will take place on Friday, October 29th at Little Paddocks at 6:30pm. Friends please accept this the only intimation.\u201dOf course, Miss Letitia Blacklock, of Little Paddocks, who lives with her old friend, Dora Bunner, young cousins Patrick and Julia, war widow Philippa Haymes and a volatile European refugee cook, named Mitzi, has no choice but to act as hostess to the gathering of local villagers who \u2018drop by\u2019 to see what will happen. What actually does happen is murder, when a young man holds up the room at the appointed time, and the stage is set for a wonderfully convoluted plot, involving the will of a wealthy financial, a great cast of possible suspects and some romance.The crime is investigated by Detective Inspector Dermot Craddock, who turns out to be the godson of Sir Henry Clithering, the ex-commissioner of Scotland Yard, who is a great believer in the powers of Miss Marple. Sir Henry is delighted when she turns out to be staying at the very hotel where the young man, who incongruously appeared at Little Paddocks, worked. By chance, she knows Bunch Harmon, one of the locals who turned up at Miss Blacklock\u2019s, so she immediately re-locates to Chipping Cleghorn, in order to aid the investigation.One of the most notable things about this mystery is not only the classic Christie setting, and characters, but the fact that the author makes much use of the changing world after WWII. Whereas before, Miss Marple bemoans, you knew who everybody was and where they came from, now people are displaced, move away and you take them at face value. With people bringing back guns from their time in the army as souvenirs, not locking doors and allowing neighbours access to their homes and having to accept people are who they say they are, this allows Christie freedom to really enjoy herself with red herrings, identities and clues.

Little Paddocks is the property owned by Miss Letitia Blacklock, a house she lives in with one of her dearest friends, two young cousins, her gardener and her cook. Everyone is shocked by the ad and denies having anything to with it. Still, Miss Blacklock feels compelled to host and on the set day and time neighbours simply \"stop by casually\". What everyone assumes is a party game takes a grim turn when a young man winds up dead. With many and differing accounts of the event, Miss Jane Marple is called upon to solve this mystery.The last Miss Marple mystery I read was a bit of a letdown. This installment, however, is by far my favorite Marple to date. Published in 1950, a death occurs in Chipping Cleghorn a village not unlike St. Mary Mead. A strange ad is published in the local gazette luring all the neighbours to the house of Miss Letitia Blacklock. Not being able to contain their curiosity, the neighbours show up, the lights go out, a man enters the room, shots are fired and said man winds up dead. Emotions range from a great thrill to fear and the question lingers of wether the death was an accident or not. Enter Miss Marple. As Miss Marple gets to know the village and its inhabitants, she begins to piece together what actually happened that night. The red herrings in this plot were vast and varied and not one detail was left unchecked. I am not kidding, even a small detail as the placement of an object or the way a person was addressed played into this mystery. Without a doubt this is one of the best plots and characterizations done by Christie. The village and neighbours were both a source of comic relief and the force that moved the plot along. I absolutely love the reveal. A few details I was able to figure out but as for the bulk of the mystery, it was a complete surprise to me. How everything tied in together, it was marvelously done. There is just one thing that bothered me with the book and that is the casual way in which the past of Mitzi, the Eastern European war refugee who is Miss Blacklock's cook, was overlooked. I do think Mitzi was depicted too harshly and her circumstances taken too lightly. Aside from that, this is as good as a book gets. Highly, highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Carol  \ua9c1\ua9c2 ", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25867535-carol", "userReview": "[ so many characters who weren't who they said they were.

The weekly publication of \u201cthe Gazette\u201d, the local newspaper of Chipping Cleghorn, and primarily the Personal column is always a guaranteed must read in order to keep up to the minute on the potential for local gossip, services wanted and items for sale. However, the peculiar announcement of a murder due to take place that evening at 6:30pm at Little Paddocks catches the residents attention, with speculation that the young folk staying with Miss Letitia Blacklock have put together a \u201cmurder game\u201d (lights out, person tapped on shoulder, screams and one person is appointment detective). The locals congregate, more for the opportunity of a little free hospitality in the form of sherry and the fleeting chance of local intrigue. As they descend under a variety of pretexts, the clock strikes 6:30pm, the lights go out, the door swings open to reveal a shadowy figure standing in the doorway. The figure then goes on to shines a torch across the room, shout \u201cStick \u2018em up!\u201d, only to be followed by shots being fired and the door swinging shut. When order is restored, it is revealed that Miss Blacklock is bleeding slightly from the ear and a masked man appears to have committed a rather bizarre act of suicide or simply bungled an attempt robbery and become an unwitting victim. Detaching the mask reveals the young man and receptionist from the Royal Spa Hotel in Medenham Wells, a Swiss national by the name of Rudi Scherz who had visited only ten days earlier and gone away quietly when his request for money was turned down by Miss Blacklock. Detailing the party guests and locals won\u2019t add too much to this overview, but needless to say the stereotypical and eccentric are out in abundance from the Colonel who has spent time in India, the war widow and the refugee housekeeper with a persecution complex. Chief Constable of Middleshire, George Rydesdale, appoints godson DI Dermot Craddock to investigate but he is dissatisfied with the pitiful motive and plausibility of Rudi Scherz for wanting to murder Miss Blacklock. However, someone else clearly does want Miss Blacklock dead and the revelation of a potential legacy due to come her way surely offers the motive. Thankfully, Sir Henry Clithering, a retired commissioner of Scotland Yard knows an \u201cold pussy\u201d who is amongst the very best of them (Miss Jane Marple). It is quite fortunate, therefore, that due to a rheumatic leg Miss Marple is staying at the hotel where Scherz worked and in on hand to recuperate with her goddaughter, the vicar of Chipping Cleghorn\u2019s wife, Diana \u201cBunch\u201d Harmon. Expect knitting, endless tea and plenty of roguish twinkles in the eyes as Miss Marple swings into action. Her pertinent probing all under the \u201csweet elderly spinster\u201d guise is an absolute pleasure and her pithy observations on everything from her knowledge of human nature to her tendency to believe the worst are a hoot. Without detailing further and spoiling the joys of reading the novel first hand, expect ruminations on the changing era where everyone no longer knows everyone\u2019s families and simply has to accept people at face value due to the displacement effect of the war. Likewise, women had well and truly entered the labour market, the black market trade was benefitting from the effect of rationing and guns had been brought home as war souvenirs and thus in good supply. The overriding issue which underpins this entire novel, however, is the question of identity and it is fascinating to see how the war has played its part and changed the status quo.Miss Marple does not enter the novel until almost a quarter of the way through A Murder is Announced and it is not until she had offered her early insights that the process of working out, who and why begins in earnest. Almost one-hundred-pages is devoted to the evening and stalled investigation, however this does allow readers to get a handle of the characters. Again, I found myself outwitted by Christie, but I felt that the ingenious solution rested on a number of highly improbable conditions (notably that Dora Bunner would be so highly suggestible and that Mitzi would be able to assume any role other than her own). An absolute pleasure to read."}, {"userName": "Lotte", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25309949-lotte", "userReview": "Really enjoyed this one!

I would suggest it to mystery readers. Miss Jane Marple however appears late in the show and has little to contribute in this case. Everything begins with A notice, that shows up in the paper of a small English town, Chipping Cleghorn: \"A murder is reported and will happen on Friday, October 29th, at Little Paddocks, at 6:30 p.m. Companions acknowledge this, the main implication.\" This comes as an astonishment to Letitia Blacklock, proprietor of Little Paddocks, as she has no clue what the notice implies; she didn't put it, and none of her sidekicks knows more than she. Miss Blacklock chooses to take it in walk and gets ready to have visitors that night. The villagers are captivated by the notice, and a few of them show up with cumbersome reasons yet clear intrigue. As the clock strikes 6:30, the lights go out and an entryway swings open, uncovering a man with a blinding light. The man requests they \"Stick them up!\" Most of the visitors do as such, trusting it to be a piece of an amusement. The diversion closes when shots are discharged into the room. The entryway pummels close, and frenzy grabs hold. It's found that circuits are blown, the shooter has been shot, and Miss Blacklock's ear is dying, clearly from a projectile touching her ear cartilage. Inquisitively, the shooter is perceived by Dora Bunner (known as \"Bunny\", an old companion of Letitia who lives at Little Paddocks as her friend) as Rudi Scherz, assistant at a nearby lodging, who had approached Letitia for cash only a couple of short days back. The police are called to investigate. All pieces of information propose that the case is only a peculiar suicide or coincidental passing, yet Inspector Craddock is uneasy about the two conceivable outcomes. His uneasiness continues along with some shocking accidents from here on."}, {"userName": "Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice", "userReview": "There is nothing like settling down with an Agatha Christie, pots of tea and hot scones in the midst of winter storms....(Had pots of tea, but no scones unfortunately).\u201cA murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October the thirteenth, at Little Paddocks \u2013 at six-thirty p.m.\u201d reads the advert in the local paper.

The reasons I like the story so much are quite simple: It's essentially a locked-room mystery, but in this one the motives for the murder are different from some of the other mysteries and caused me to think a lot about the effect that the one simple lie (I won't spoil which one) had on the lives of all the people involved - including on the perpetrator, who is very conflicted over the course of actions taken, when that lie is at risk of being discovered.\u201cIt's what's in yourself that makes you happy or unhappy.\u201d Unlike in some other Christie mysteries, the portrayal of characters is also much more sympathetic to the more ordinary characters who usually seem to be somewhat patronised or ridiculed - quite often by Marple, which is why I don't like her much.

I really enjoyed this book, which was apparently Christie's 50th (although publishers had to count a book of short stories to make this true, and they really wanted to, because publicists never change). It starts out kind of like a game. An ad is taken out in the local paper of the small country village, Chipping Cleghorn (so British), announcing that a murder will be performed at Two Paddocks, the home of Miss Leticia Blacklock, an elderly spinster, at 6:30 that evening. Everyone who knows her assumes this is a murder mystery game being staged by Miss Blacklock herself, and conveniently show up \"just to check in,\" all excepting one oblivious person who comes right out and says she's there for the murder, which Miss Blacklock then denies having any part of. They all wait to see what happens . . . and at 6:30 on the dot, the lights go out, and a murder is committed.The rest of the book goes as Miss Marple books usually go. A local police inspector takes charge of the investigation, and Miss Marple does her thing* quietly in the background, aiding the police when possible, and using her old lady status to shake people down all gentle and quiet-like. A pool of suspects is soon determined, and the facts about inheritances and secret identities revealed.*Language makes me laugh. Word usage just changes over time, man, and suddenly things written in 1950 take on a whole new meaning. For example, detectives repeatedly referring to Miss Marple as an \"old pussy\". I'm sorry, I giggled. I couldn't help it.I did have a bit of trouble keeping track of the differences between all the generic British people at first, because they aren't really identified beyond name, and in some cases, occupation (or wife of person with an occupation). That sorted itself out eventually, though, because Christie was very good at giving even her secondary characters personalities that shine through without exposition. Also, I listened to this on audio, and Emilia Fox is really good at voices.As mentioned above, I did manage to perform a miracle and identify the murderer on my first guess, early on. This did not affect my enjoyment, because it was entirely a guess based on no clues or intelligence whatsoever. It was basically me spinning in a circle and pointing a finger at whoever I landed on when I stopped spinning. That I quickly abandoned my suspect is a testament not only to how bad I am at solving mysteries, but to Christie's skill at planting red herrings and misdirections all over the damn place. I think it's a rare person who could solve the mystery without guessing."}, {"userName": "Fiona", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona", "userReview": "A reread for work. Happy new year, everyone.I love Miss Marple for several reasons: most notably because she is a rural English lady with a strong sense of morality, who knits things and notices things, and she has been a role model of mine for at least a decade.I love this book in particular, partly because it's an extremely well-written example of its genre, but mostly because as far as I can recall, it's the first book I ever read that made me think, \"Huh. Those characters are clearly lesbians.\" And actually quite aspirational, for me aged eleven or twelve or however old I must have been - newly into secondary school, anyway. Agatha Christie was my favourite author at the time, and this was probably even before I'd registered that \"bisexual\" was a word - certainly before I'd started thinking about such things in any kind of concrete terms, and here were these two ladies stomping around in wellies (I had wellies!) and feeding chickens (I fed chickens!) and just generally enjoying each other's company.Funny where your introductions to such things comes from.

gripping plot, and a unique story line set in the perfectly quiet English village of Chipping Cleghorn---until a murder announcement is placed into the local newspaper, casually inviting the entire village to Letty Blacklock\u2019s home for an evening of dry sherry and murder.\tNaturally everyone presumes that the advertisement was someone\u2019s idea of fun, but when the body of Swiss receptionist, Rudi Schertz turns up dead on the evening of the party, it becomes clear that Miss Blacklock was the intended target.\tMany memorable characters infuse this mystery with effervescent fun and provide a host of glorious Christie-style suspects, including debonair Patrick Simmons, icy Julia Simmons, murder-minded Mrs. Sweetnham and her laconic writer son, Edmond, the refugee maid Mitzi, who is hysterically funny in her interview with the police, and distant Phillipa Haymes, a quiet young widow who works as a gardener.\tThe police are baffled by the case---until Miss Marple joins the investigation, and under the pretense of visiting wildly absentminded Bunch Harmon, she quietly knits by the hearth and solves the case with classic grace and dignity.\tThere are some wonderful film adaptations of A Murder is Announced, including Joan Hickson\u2019s iconic portrayal of the clever spinster sleuth, and the later adaptation starring Geraldine McEwan, but the closest portrayal is still the written word, as Agatha Christie\u2019s delightfully classic works continue to set the gold standard for detective fiction."}, {"userName": "Nahed.E", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2015",

at the Miss Marple series. This one has an interesting cast of characters, Miss Marple showing everyone up, and references to characters that many in the series should know by now, such as Sir Henry Clithering. Due to Miss Marple's connection to Sir Henry and just being around the area, she gets pulled in to investigate when a supposed murder party goes wrong and then two more people die afterwards. The book begins when residents of Chipping Cleghorn read about an announcement for murder in their local newspaper. It gives the time (6:30) and place (Little Paddocks) on October 29. The owner of Little Paddocks (Letitia Blacklock) knows nothing of this until relatives of her that are staying on at her home bring it up. With Ms. Blacklock realizing that the announcement means the whole village (or there about) are going to descend on her home, she decides to make preparations. I have to say that due to the characters that Agatha Christie has in this one you have no idea who could be behind things until the end. Once that happens, you will do what I did the first time I read this book, you will go back to certain places in the book and you will realize how Christie pointed out several things to you that you may have not realized the first time through. I will say that I hate that the e-book version shows the most frequently highlighted passages. That can give you a clue as a new reader but it also can spoil things for you. Turn that off if you can and just read the book fresh.Miss Marple was on top of her game for this one (IMHO) and I loved how she was welcomed by the local police and used her great powers of deduction to figure this one out. It was great to read about how Sir Henry called her one of the best detectives he ever met. I also really enjoyed the character of Bunch (she reminds me of a scattier version of Dolly Bantry. Also the character of Inspector Craddock was great. He could have been a naysayer to Miss Marple. But he quickly takes her on board as a colleague of sorts and I would love to see this one re-done with the younger Inspector learning the ropes fro Miss Marple. Heck, I can see a kick butt spin-off as a BBC adaption. The setting of Little Paddocks as well as the whole village feels a bit like a village that time forgot. This was written in the 1950s, but I think the book is supposed to take place after World War II, but for some weird reason, it reads as if it was during the war due to people making a note of bartering, only being allowed to have so much coal, etc. I didn't know that England was still under rules such as that in the 1950s. I am sure one of you will let me know about that in the comments.What I get a kick out of in this one is that Christie explores the same themes in this one (no telling) in several of her other works. I just think she did a much better job of them in this story."}, {"userName": "Wedad", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46848554-wedad", "userReview": "\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0628\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0627\u0637\u0644\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0634\u0641 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644 \u061f\u061f\u0623\u0631\u0627\u0647\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0641\u064a \" \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627 \" \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u064a\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a \u0628\u063a\u0636\u0648\u0646 24 \u0633\u0627\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0636 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0639\u0648\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0633\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0632\u0644 \u0648\u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0636\u0627\u0628\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0637\u0629 \u0648\"\u0643\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0644\u0627\u062a\u0629 \" \u0648\u064a\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0641 \u0643\u0644 \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0628\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0648\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0631\u0649 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u062b\u0631\u062b\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u062c\u0627\u0626\u0632 \u064a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u062c\u062f\u064a \u0648\u062a\u0641\u0643 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0628\u0633\u0627\u062a \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629"}, {"userName": "Nandakishore Varma", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma", "userReview": "A really intriguing mystery, which uses a plot device which Christie has used in many stories - yet it will be difficult to spot it.

Amidst the personal column in the Chipping Cleghorn Gazette one Friday morning is the announcement of a murder to take place at Little Paddocks that evening. Intrigued, the inhabitants of this little village head off there expecting a murder game. And at half past six, as announced, it starts with the lights going out and a sudden hold up, but things soon begin to take a serious turn as shots are fired and Miss Letitia Blacklock is grazed by one of them, and the shooter, a young Swiss man (who no one (besides Miss Blacklock) seems to recognise) ends up dead. And this is unfortunately only the first of the deaths that take place in this exciting mystery. The case is handed to young Inspector Craddock, intelligent, efficient, good-hearted, and who also just happens to be Sir Henry\u2019s godson. When an elderly lady writes to offer her help, Sir Henry (on the scene at that point) is thrilled to find that it is his own special old lady (not the words he uses) with matchless skills, and Craddock doesn\u2019t take long to find out either that she is the real thing. Miss Marple is once again in this book (like in Sleeping Murder before this) much more active, diving into life at Chippng Cleghorn, paying visits, gossiping and putting on the appearance, as Craddock puts it, of having \u201cnosey parkeritis\u201d in what is her most complicated puzzle yet. This one I also found somewhat different from the other Marple books so far in that Miss M doesn\u2019t rely entirely on her knowledge of human nature to solve her case but far more on information that emerges from the many conversations she has with those involved. The puzzle for me is among Christie\u2019s best and though I was reading this for the fourth or fifth time, I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially the characters (all unique and with their little idiosyncrasies), all the little details and plot twists. The setting of this book is in the post-war period and AC weaves in the changes and challenges that this brought with it\u2014rationing, the not so very legal exchanges of everyday things, young war widows having to earn their livings, a generation adjusting to the sweeping changes in the way of life that have come about, and another not knowing that things were any different from what they are.

Despite the fact that I half-solved the mystery, I still think A Murder is Announced was wonderfully well constructed."}, {"userName": "Arybo \u2728", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50870096-arybo", "userReview": "Ottimo. Il migliore che abbia letto di Miss Marple. C\u2019\u00e8 un Rivolgimento della trama verso la fine che mi ha fatto addirittura applaudire. Fortunatamente ero sola a casa.

The story begins with a mysterious ad in the local paper, which states, \"A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October 29th, at Little Paddocks, at 6:30 p.m. Friends accept this, the only intimation.\" This is the home of Letitia Blacklock and Dora Bunner, elderly spinsters who would seem to be the last sort of people to play such a joke - if joke it is. However, Ms Blacklock is game and prepares for the big night, though Ms Bunner just wants to run for the hills, convinced that one of them will get killed. On the night of October 29th, several interested parties show up. Everything is calm and friendly - until the lights go out and a man storms in with a gun, yelling for them to \"Stick 'em up!\" Everyone obliges, assuming this is part of the game, but then a shot is heard. When the lights finally come back and order is restored, the gunman is found dead. Who shot him? Miss Marple is very conveniently staying in the area and promptly involves herself in the investigation. The plot revolves around false identities, greed, deception, and what Miss Marple describes in a later book as a \"weak, amiable\" killer, who is so desperate to protect their secrets that they are even willing to kill the person they hold most dear. This is one of the Agatha Christies where even after you learn who did it and realize they ended up taking three lives, you can't help but feel sorry for them and understand what drove them to it. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/314287-helen", "userReview": "Listened to an audio, typically brilliant and well presented."}], "description": "The villagers of Chipping Cleghorn, including Jane Marple, are agog with curiosity over an advertisement in the local gazette which read: 'A murder is announced and will take place on Friday October 29th, at Little Paddocks at 6:30 p.m.' Unable to resist the mysterious invitation, a crowd begins to gather at Little Paddocks at the pointed time when, without warning, the lights go out ...", "title": "A Murder Is Announced\n      \n          (Miss Marple #5)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6458542-a-murder-is-announced", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1458433718l/6458542.jpg", "reviews": 1433, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/123715.Agatha_Christie", "name": "Agatha Christie"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Classics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6458542-a-murder-is-announced", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1437532.A_Murder_is_Announced", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16298.A_Murder_Is_Announced", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13565506", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9571948-a-murder-is-announced", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21463944-a-murder-is-announced", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/645654.A_Murder_Is_Announced", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31308.A_Murder_Is_Announced", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8104916", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/763483.A_Murder_is_Announced", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22915733-un-delitto-avr-luogo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11063341-a-murder-is-announced", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16299.And_Then_There_Were_None", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16343.The_Mysterious_Affair_at_Styles", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/853510.Murder_on_the_Orient_Express", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16331.Murder_at_the_Vicarage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16328.The_Murder_of_Roger_Ackroyd"]}
