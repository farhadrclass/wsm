I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop--for some kind of action to start--but it never did. It is just the musings of a displaced Yankee trying to adjust to life in the South. It was oddly calming.I did appreciated how the author managed to hit on some of the Southern traits that are weird to outsiders without making them seem cartoonish or over-the-top. Very understated, a nice break from the wacky characters and outlandish situations in the string of Southern books I've been reading."}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/634204-debra", "userReview": "A love affair gone bad sent Natalie from NYC and corporate law to Macon Georgia and the public prosecutor's office.

I was perusing the bargain section at Barnes and Noble and this one stood out. I liked the cover - the cute little sundress, the sandals and the title. It was only $4.95, minus $0.49 cents with my membership discount.  This book has a slow beginning, a slow middle and a slow end.  Natalie Goldberg moved to Macon, Georgia, after a failed romance left her jobless in NYC. She is the daughter of a famous civil rights attorney and is staunchly opposed to the death penalty. Her job working in criminal law causes turmoil in her mind and among her family. That is, according to the author, because you don't feel much of the turmoil. You don't feel much of anything. Nothing is developed in this book. Natalie doesn't develop. The other characters don't develop. The plot doesn't develop. There's no real climax. I understand that it's meant to be a light beach read, but it doesn't give you that need to turn the page to see what happens next. I read the whole thing to be stubborn. I don't like to start books and never finish them.  There are a few moments in the book where you think, ok, this is it. There is going to be some action. A colleague enlists her help in getting his sister out of an abusive situation. I thought maybe this would be a major plot line and would involve her talking to the sister and dodging some bullets. Nope. Natalie just breezes into this lady's house, though they don't know each other, spouts of some domestic violence statistics that she got from Google or Law and Order:SVU and then the woman just agrees to pack up right at that moment and leave the house with her kids, but without the dog. Okay...not realistic, but I thought maybe there would be a story involving the husband. Nope, this part of the story is briefly alluded to in the book, sister is okay, hubby is mad and killed the dog and here is a necklace to thank you. Said colleague, Carl, seems to like Natalie and you expect a romance storyline there. Not really. You get an epiphany from her in the last couple of pages of the book, but it all falls flat. The book began with Natalie reporting a death threat to the sherrif's office. Oooooooh, death threats. This will be suspenseful, right? Nope. The subject of death threats is never explored and is dropped by the third page.  Ok, so there is a big trial and the suspect will get sentenced to the death penalty if found guilty. This is it. This is the big moment of the book, right? Nope, predictable and easy. Every now and then Natalie whines that she doesn't like the death penalty, but we don't really \"go there\" with her. There is some strife with her parents over her position at the law firm, but the author doesn't delve into it and then wraps it up in a pretty bow at the end of the story.  You don't get much of Southern comfort or the culture shock of coming from the Northeast to Georgia. She mentions funny Southern words now and then and a few landmarks, but this book could really be set anywhere else and you wouldn't notice a difference. There is no sense of culture. Natalie goes to a bar with a friend and learns about zydeco dancing, but the author seemed off the mark in the description. She also likes to drop, \"I'm a Jew\" or \"that guy is black\" now and then. I don't know if the author is trying to make a statement or anything, but she mentions those things in weird ways. Like she's trying to make it an issue.  It's a book that lack a lot - interest, development, personality. None of the characters seem very likable. They are not offensive, you just don't care for them either way. The story is dry, flat and predictable. Oh, and another peeve. The author really enjoyed adding a ton of flourish to each sentence. She could never just say, \"I walked across the street to the deli.\" No, it would be, \"I lazily yet hastily walked with a limp and a skip across the black, black like an orchid in the night, street with cars beeping their cacophony of horny symphony at me as I headed towards the glass-encrusted door of the mellow delicatessen.\" Every sentence needed embellishment. That's fine now and then, but when you include it on every page it becomes pretentious.  There is a reason that such a new book went into the Bargain Bin."}, {"userName": "Deon Stonehouse", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15006158-deon-stonehouse", "userReview": "My Summer of Southern Discomfort by Stephanie Gayle follows a New York lawyer\u2019s uncomfortable move to a small southern town. Natalie intended all her life to follow in the footsteps of her father, a famous civil right\u2019s lawyer. She wants to fight the good fight for justice. Natalie was on track to reach all her dreams, hiring on with a prestigious New York law firm after graduating from Harvard. She did not plan on having an affair with a married partner in the firm, falling in love, or taking the blame when he makes a costly error. With her career in tatters Natalie heads south, where a small Georgia town is delighted to hire a Harvard educated prosecutor and not about to look this gift horse too closely in the mouth. Natalie\u2019s family is horrified by her move to a small conservative southern town and the prosecutor\u2019s office. For a long time Natalie feels like an alien, but she begins to open up to her flower planting neighbor and a slower pace of life. When she is partnered with an older southern lawyer on a murder case, she discovers her new co-workers have a lot more on the ball than she suspected. Natalie finds a sense of community in her small town, leaving the big city wasn\u2019t the end of life just a new beginning.

After an affair that turned bad, the main character, Natalie Goldberg, trades in corporate law in NYC for the district attorney's office in Macon, Georgia. Predictably, Natalie learns some lessons about herself and her life through the people she meets in her new town. I actually did enjoy the book, although I would have enjoyed it considerably more if I was on summer vacation and sipping something fruity with an umbrella in it. Two things that drove me CRAZY: (1) The author under-uses contractions, which makes the dialogue very strange and stilted, and (2) There is no mention of using DNA -- only blood-typing -- in Natalie's capital case. The book is set in 2000, so that doesn't make sense to me."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1832562-ruth", "userReview": "Cover has a chick on it and some pink but I liked the title and checked it out. I'm probably a little beyond half way and the story isn't in focus yet - unless it's supposed to be as general and meandering as the title suggests \u2026 a young lawyer, daughter of a famous defense attorney, moves from the North to Macon, GA to be a prosecutor. The story tells of her past and present, various coworkers, numerous court cases - I think maybe my problem with the book is a great deal of the story is in her heart and head and there's not a great deal of action and what action there is happens at a very slow pace even by hot, humid Georgia standards. But I'll finish it. Maybe my opinion will change.Finished it and it is just what the title suggests - a report on what she did over the summer.

Actually some elements of talented writing peeking through, but the author appears to played it safe/stuck to some sort of formula too much. I was impressed with her ability to play on the reader's emotions for both the victims in the fictional crime and the perpetrator facing death row. This could have been a much better book if she\u2019d stayed further away from unidimensional character cliches and delved deeper into raw character development (for example, why wait until the last paragraph of the last chapter to hint at the main character\u2019s OCD?!).

This book is one of the few in that already-small selection with a protagonist who is primarily concerned about something other than going shopping and getting married - so, fair warning, if you go into it expecting a zany, fish-out-of-water chick lit book as suggested by the blurb and cover, you're going to be sorely disappointed. There is humor, but it's quieter and more sarcastic than, say, Stephanie Plum (again, like the reference to humidity's effect on one's hair would suggest). It takes on hard issues, and does an excellent job quietly examining all the little contradictions that make up people in general, and the South in particular, in a slice-of-life format."}, {"userName": "Rachel Gioia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3420082-rachel-gioia", "userReview": "I would actually give this more like 2.5 stars, but without the half, I would opt closer to 2 than to 3.

The story about the lawyer daughter of a high-profile civil rights lawyer who moves down to Georgia because of a work-place romance gone South (no pun intended) and gets placed on a big murder trial at her new job, much to the chagrin of her father. This book didn't seem to go anywhere, and the most exciting part was the trial during the last 60 or so pages of the book. Not really a book I would recommend.

It blended some of the little things that make the south, not NYC (main character moves from NYC to Macon, Ga because she screwed up and fell for a married man at her law practice). It is humorous because it also does a very good job at looking at the uniqueness of \"southerness\" from a northeasterners eyes. Though admittedly it may have been a little funnier to me because I have heard some of these same comments from my NJ husband living in the south.
