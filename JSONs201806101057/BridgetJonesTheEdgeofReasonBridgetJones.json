Still working out feelings re: sequel, as original was pure perfection, part of identity, Pride & Prejudice-related (so obviously superior to almost all other works of fiction), etc. Am having trouble reckoning feelings for this novel, as trainwreck of a movie is hanging over head in manner of pinata filled with poo or old, stinky cheeses.Shall not dwell on turd of a movie, however, flawed as it is, because love the lovely book! Like Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary, sequel is based on Jane Austen novel, this time Persuasion. Had not read Persuasion until several years ago and ended up liking just as much (if not more? blasphemy!) as P&P. Naturally, Persuasion suffers from clear lack of Darcy, however Wentworth equally swoon-worthy, also Anne Elliot is obvious patron saint of Singletons everywhere, having been declared old spinster at virginal age of 27.Our little Bridget is still struggling with job, money, romance, family (overbearing mother, drunken father), blah dee blah LIFE in usual ridiculous and fun manner. All old friends are back, including urban family (Jude, Shazzer, Tom), Marrieds (Smug and Otherwise), insane boss Richard Finch, delightful mess Daniel Cleaver, and of course Mark Darcy, with whom Bridget is now deeply in love. New characters join Bridget\u2019s world in form of odious Rebecca, a jellyfish (aka frenemy) on the prowl for Bridget\u2019s boyfriend, and friend Magda\u2019s adorable moppets, created to make Bridget look alternately crazy and competent.Do wish that book had not included any romantic turmoil for Bridget and Mark Darcy, however realize that there would have been conspicuous lack of plot otherwise. Could not even bring self to get worked up over ridiculousness of certain plotlines (Thai prison, hole in side of flat, stinky fish left in purse for weeks, what-have-you) because of love for all things Bridget and Darcy, also because of equally important happy ending (spoilers)! Suppose am typical girl that way, heart going all aflutter at any mention of Jones-Darcy reconciliation, evidence of Darcy-still-in-love, etc.Recommend this book for all who enjoyed Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary, or like well-done chick lit (still hate that hateful phrase, should stop using immediately) in general. Especially worth reading for special treat in sequel (as all sequels must one-up original) in form of Colin Firth (aka THE Mr. Darcy) being interviewed by Bridget Jones, which unfolds exactly as one would expect.In short, sequel is v.g."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/513331-suzanne", "userReview": "The Colin Firth interview is hilarious!

Bridget returns as the hapless and can't-get-it-together heroine with plenty of love, work and weight troubles. The first book has a happy ending and I thought that was the end of it. Since it's so successful, of course the author cannot resist conjuring contrived plot lines for Bridget's second adventure. Bridget came across as charming and endearing in the first book but here she becomes annoying and irritating. I (or the readers) love her int he first book because Bridget is not flawless. This makes her a very accessible character. However, the contrived plot lines of this book has managed to create a gratingly stupid Bridget which I cannot empathise with anymore.This is what happens when authors go on beyond the 'happily ever after' last line."}, {"userName": "AMEERA ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32325414-ameera", "userReview": "I hate say this but I hate this book , can be much better if Helen fielding just wrote bridge Jones's diary and stop"}, {"userName": "Alaina Meserole", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50620706-alaina-meserole", "userReview": "I don't really know why I still had this book on my TBR because I didn't really like the first book.. but oh well, I dove right into this one anyways.Okay, so in Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason Bridget starts to suspect that her boyfriend Mark is starting to develop feelings for one of his coworkers, Rebecca. Of course this was a huge misunderstanding on her part because he doesn\u2019t have any feelings for her at all. However, it is Bridget and it wouldn\u2019t be a book if she found out that she was wrong right away. Nope. In the end, she felt foolish for even thinking that and all is right in the world because Rebecca started dating someone else. Right? Wrong. I hated this book so much. LE SIGH!Like I said, I didn't like the first book.. so I definitely didn't like this book either. It wasn't funny at all to me. It's like I was fake laughing just to get out of this book faster. I just don't like Bridget at all. She was so annoying and frustrating throughout the whole book. I didn't care what she went through or said throughout the entire thing. I just wanted this book to be over as soon as I started it. Spoiler alert: wine helped me get through this book. A lot of wine.Overall, I hated this book. I will never ever reread this series.

For while with the first book, with Bridget Jones's Diary, although Bridget often was indeed outrageous and even at times (and perhaps even rather regularly) inappropriate, she was still and usually engaged in antics that could easily and even normally happen (events, personal behaviours to which I could at least mildly and personally relate), whereas, at least for me, the majority of the scenarios presented, featured in The Edge of Reason, but especially the entire Thailand episode, simply feel a bit too strange, too over-the-top, interesting enough perhaps, but also somewhat alienating. And thus, while definitely still for the most part an enjoyable and entertainingly light romp, with The Edge of Reason, I sometimes and perhaps even more than sometimes do tend to feel more like a dispassionate and even analysing (coldly critical) observer and monitor of Bridget, while with the first book, with Bridget Jones's Diary, I very much and often felt like I was Bridget (or at least that I could be Bridget), actually experiencing her frustrations, her dietary faux pax, her searches for the perfect man (and I just cannot seem dispense with my personal sense of disbelief with much of the action featured and presented in The Edge of Reason, simply because much of it is so far beyond my own personal experiences that it feels strange, even at times rather majorly disconcerting and disconnecting). But all that being said and my issues with reality and exaggeration notwithstanding, The Edge of Reason does remain for me a generally enjoyable read and as such one which I do still heartily recommend for fans of Bridget Jones' Diary (but with the caveat that it is certainly nowhere near as good and as entertaining as the first book, and the additional personal warning to absolutely NOT bother with the second movie instalment, as it veers so far beyond the plot of the novel to be simply massively annoying and majorly frustrating)."}, {"userName": "Kimberly Carrington-Fox", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33752173-kimberly-carrington-fox", "userReview": "La Fielding se saca de la manga una trama liosa y con muchos altibajos, perdiendo mucha de la gracia y frescura del pirmer libro.

I have to say that with both books, there were definitely laugh-out-loud moments, although there were more with Edge of Reason than Diary.I'm embarrassed to admit it took me at least to the middle of the book to realize that this book was a take-off of Persuasion. And once again, I admire Ms. Fielding's facility in translating a classic to the modern age. Before I picked up this book, I wondered, idly, \"Pride and Prejudice ended with a marriage. What on earth is Helen Fielding going to do in her sequal?\" I assumed it would be one more of those books written by Jane Austen devotees who cannot stand not knowing what happens next, where Elizabeth and Darcy, happily married, turn detective, or where Elizabeth, happily married, works on getting Georgiana married off. Turning to Persuasion for inspiration was felicitous.In Persuasion, Anne Elliott and Captain Wentworth loved each other in their youth (fully ten years ago), but were driven apart by the machinations and bad advice of Anne's family. At the end of the book, happily, they have reconciled and their love is as strong as ever. In Edge of Reason, Bridget and Mark have been together for a full four weeks before they are driven apart by a series of misunderstandings, the machinations of vicious Rebecca (an exceedingly well-drawn character), and the bad advice (at least, in Mark's opinion) that Bridget has gleaned from the self-help books that comprise her library. Well done, Ms. Fielding -- I think that's a wonderful way to begin a sequal and also an inspired retelling of a classic.This book was great fun and brought me great joy reading it. I think Ms. Fielding's satirical pen has sharpened somewhat."}, {"userName": "Devon Hernandez", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3719788-devon-hernandez", "userReview": "Fits of uncontrollable laughter. That would describe me reading this book. What a great followup to the first one! For those of you who have only seen the movie and not read the book, warning: the movie script cuts quite a bit out, and changes quite a bit. For instance, the whole lesbian thing in the movie? Never happened. The \"other woman\" who Bridget thought was after Mark really was after Mark in the book. Daniel Cleaver barely makes an appearance, just a brief few times, literally only 3 brief occasions. He was never in Thailand with Bridget and Shaz, as he was in the movie. Therefore, the fight scene with Mark and Daniel never happens...however, he does (Mark) punch him (Daniel) in a later scene, but nothing like the fight in the movie. Also, Mark doesn't go to Thailand to rescue Bridget - he did his work at home and in Dubai to catch Jed. The one thing that amuses me vastly about what they cut out was the fact that Bridget interviews Colin Firth for a freelance newspaper article!!! HA! For obvious reasons, that would have been impossible to have in the movie script, as Colin Firth ended up playing Mark Darcy in the movies. They really, really did leave out A LOT, and this is definitely one of many occasions where the book so surpasses the attempt at the movie. That being said, I love the movie and it's hilarious. It just doesn't match up with the book, and that always pisses me off. It's really too bad that Helen Fielding never came out with a trilogy for this. I would have loved to have had a third book detailing Mark and Bridget getting engaged and married and some crazy stuff happening amidst all of that (the book ends with no engagement).

Todo parece irle bien a la protagonista. Est\u00e1 con el hombre al que ama, Mark Darcy, y su vida parece ir sobre ruedas. Sumergida en manuales de auto-ayuda, iremos descubriendo junto a ella su vida y sus andanzas. Para los fans de la pel\u00edcula, lo cierto es que el libro no tiene absolutamente nada que ver con esta. En la cinta, se presenta un argumento mucho m\u00e1s dulce y edulcorado, mientras que en el libro, la historia es algo bastante m\u00e1s oscura. Aunque hay partes del di\u00e1logo que s\u00ed son exactamente las mismas. (Creo que es la primera vez que dir\u00e9 esto pero\u2026 Me gust\u00f3 m\u00e1s la pel\u00edcula).Si bien es un libro que me ha recordado much\u00edsimo a la primera parte, en esta segunda entrega el personaje de Bridget resulta quiz\u00e1s m\u00e1s rid\u00edculo que en el primer libro. Tiene ciertos puntos en los que sent\u00ed verdadera verg\u00fcenza ajena. En cierto modo es bueno porque hace que te des cuenta de que realmente has empatizado con el personaje, pero creo que a veces la autora peca de ser muy malvada con su creaci\u00f3n. El argumento del libro es m\u00e1s de lo mismo: Bridget intentando hacer cosas y fracasando en ellas. Al principio del libro vemos a una Bridget enamorada que poco a poco va entrando en una espiral de celos que hace temblar los tabiques de su relaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, creo que no aporta nada nuevo, ya que la protagonista siempre se encuentra ante los mismos problemas. Digamos que tropieza varias veces en la misma piedra.En lo que respecta al estilo de la autora, se mantiene la estructura del primer libro, esto es, est\u00e1 escrita en formato diario. He de puntualizar que he le\u00eddo la versi\u00f3n traducida, por lo que es posible que se haya perdido originalidad en la traducci\u00f3n. Partiendo de esto, el lenguaje me ha resultado muy llano y simple. Esto por un lado, permite al lector seguir f\u00e1cilmente el hilo argumental, pero por otro da la sensaci\u00f3n de dejadez a la hora de escribir. Por \u00faltimo, decir que es un libro que ha perdido frescura con respecto al anterior y que peca de tener una trama muy repetitiva. A pesar de ello, lo recomiendo para aquellos que son fans de la primera pel\u00edcula y tambi\u00e9n del primer libro, puesto que es imprescindible para seguir conociendo a Bridget Jones y para descubrir si finalmente es capaz de ser feliz, o si por el contrario, habr\u00e1 que esperar al tercer libro."}, {"userName": "Migl\u0117 Keliotyt\u0117", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32658387-migl-keliotyt", "userReview": "What a wonderful book.

I got the book from my local library which is why I probably don't mind some of its flaws and will continue to read the series. I love the fact that Colin Firth stars in the movies while Bridget swoons over him in the books. The character of Bridget seems to be the strength as well as the weakness of the novel. While I like her attitude sometimes and she is an easy-to-relate-to character (hello procrastination), other times she's plain annoying. It's also a bit scary to see how much some aspects of the genre changed since the turn of the millennium while other themes sadly stayed the same.

In her first Bridget Jones book, she taught us that no woman is complete unless she has the love of a foppish, sub-Hugh Grant, barely heterosexual posh man to complete her. To add to the confusion, Bridget is in love with the actor Colin Firth, who they end up casting in the film as her actual love interest, Mark Darcy. If that wasn't confusing enough, they throw in Hugh actual Grant as the Bad Boy Whom All Women Are Attracted To In Spite Of Themselves. And he doesn't really play a Hugh Grant type either. Well, he does, but it's more like the Hugh Grant in About A Boy. Or the Hugh Grant in real life, who fucks crack whores in the mouth.This is a review of the book though, which is not a film. It's not the first book either, it's the sequel to the first book. And it's not the film which is a sequel to the first film. In this book, Bridget gets her dream job, interviewing Colin Firth for some magazine or TV show or whatever. This is very confusing if you've seen the first film, obviously. This is the book though, so we'll carry on.Does anything of note happen in this book? LOADS of stuff, but none that I can actually remember. There's a scene at the start of it which is funny because foreign people are hilarious, and gay people are icky. I think that's the point the author was trying to make, anyway. The key themes of the book are that women are useless without men, other women stab you in the back at every opportunity, and that no one thin or good looking can be a good person.Fielding's novels are loosely based on a couple of Jane Austen books, although they're not that much like them; well, except for the fact that their attitudes to women, men and relationships are two hundred years out of date.Can't wait for the third one!"}, {"userName": "Erica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica", "userReview": "As I've mentioned, I'm relistening to the Bridget Jones books because the new one is out and I'll be reading/listening to it soon; I feel I need to brush up on what happened ten billion years ago.So.Bridget.I never liked this story as well as the first one, though time has mellowed my viewpoint a bit.

She got her boyfriend, she met Colin Firth, she hung out with her mother's African...um...what was he? Guest. We'll call him a guest. Because \"pet\" is demeaning. She got arrested coming home from Thailand, she got to experience The Fantasy that all people go through when someone breaks up with them (the whole crawling back/turns out he was pathetic thing) and she's still a flake after ALL THAT?But looking back, I have had lots of adventures, some scary moments, plus big events and small and if I were really honest with myself? I can't say I've grown much, either. I might be a little wiser but I think that comes more from winding down toward a sedentary lifestyle and less from learning things, meaning I'm too lazy to fight or care anymore and don't do as many crazy things as a result.
