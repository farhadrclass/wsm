I was at a disadvantage, you see. I was not independently wealthy. I was still building a living for myself. I had three women I was seeing, all interviewing for a more permanent position as my wife. So yes, I was never able to linger while traveling, due to the fact that I always had a pressing need to return to my life, to shore up my business interests, and to keep my social relationships growing. I was, without a doubt, a tourist. Shamefully so. Despite knowing this about me, Port did stop in one evening to ask me if I wanted to go with them to North Africa. I was disappointed that his wife Kit was not with him. I guess I might as well confess this now. I was in love with Kit. It was quite awkward actually. A psychologist might make a case that my inability to pick one companion from the available women in my life actually stems from a deep seated belief that eventually Kit would come to her senses, divorce Port, and fling herself into my arms. \u201dThe head is like the sky. Always turning around and around inside. But very slowly. When you think, you make it go too fast. Then it aches.\u201dI don\u2019t really know how it happened. I thought I had the inside track. I grew up with her. I watched the moth morph into a beautiful butterfly. We exchanged books and thoughts about those books. We hung out together to the detriment of our individual studies. We occasionally kissed with something more than friendly affection. I was on the verge of asking her to marry me when she abruptly disappeared on a whirlwind tour of the world. She came back with Port. It didn\u2019t take me long to discover that my ship had sailed and Port\u2019s had docked. I was always watching (analysing) him whenever I was around him, trying to discover what exactly it was about him that had so quickly convinced Kit that he was the one for her. I was more shattered than I could ever reveal. It was only later that I realized that my life or at least the thought of a life with me was something she would have found horribly confining. Port\u2019s attraction was his shiftlessness. His lack of roots. His avoidance of responsibilities. Anytime anything became TOO REAL. He moved on to somewhere else. His money was a buffer between himself and dealing with any of the tedious expectations that others may have for him. He was free. I was burdened. I was still considering the North Africa trip. It would have been a perfect opportunity to spend some time with Kit because invariably Port would disappear on some side trip in search of greater meaning. I didn\u2019t say yes right away. I\u2019d assumed I\u2019d have more than a few minutes to give Port an answer, but as usual I underestimated his impulsive nature. They left with a fellow named Tunner. I had met Tunner, only in the most casual sense. We\u2019d once occupied the same space at a party of mutual friends. I\u2019d logged his presence only because of the way he looked at Kit. It was probably much the same way as I looked at her as well. I only received one letter from Kit while they were in North Africa. \"She was content to watch the soft unvaried landscape going by. To be sure several times it occurred to her that they were not really moving at all, that the dune along whose sharp rim they were now traveling was the same dune they had left behind earlier, that there was no question of going anywhere since they were nowhere. And when these sensations came to her they started a slight stirring of a thought \u2018Am I Dead?\u2019\"Needless to say the letter was disconcerting to me. It reeked of disassociation and had me wondering if those vast endless horizons of the African desert were beginning to inspire some form of mental illness. My worst fears, as it turned out, were mere childish angst compared to the trials and tribulations she actually suffered. I blame Port, of course, but I also can\u2019t help but blame her as well. After all, she chose the wrong man. The family, Kit\u2019s kin, came to me and asked me to go fetch her in North Africa. They didn\u2019t know anyone else with the connections to Kit or anyone possessing the wherewithal to make the journey. I guess a part of me thought this was finally my chance to be with her, but seeing the way she looked at me when I reached out to greet her was distressing. It was as if I were just part of the background of her life...a chair for instance that doesn\u2019t exist until she has the need to sit. \u201dshe tried to break away from him. In another minute life would be painful. The words were coming back, and inside the wrappings of the words there would be thoughts lying there. The hot sun would shrivel them; they must be kept inside in the dark.\u201dShe told me everything on the journey home. The death of Port. The rape and worse, the acceptance of rape. She allowed herself to become a possession, a man\u2019s plaything. For a while she even enjoyed it because she didn\u2019t have to make decisions about anything. She traded sex for some semblance of peace. She tried a couple of times to crawl into my bunk on the way home, but I would only hold her against me, trapping her hands when they ventured near my groin. She found that particular solace with one of the young sailors or maybe more than one. I went through all the stages of grief: fear, anger, depression, but by the time we arrived in New York I\u2019d finally reached some level of acceptance. The last I heard Kit was in New Mexico, but by the time a letter would reach her, she\u2019d be somewhere else. I often wondered, late at night, with a warm snifter of cognac in my hand and a good book close to hand, whether if I\u2019d agreed to go on the trip, would Port still be alive, and would Kit be a less fractured version of herself.

It\u2019s that terrible precision that we hate so much. But because we don\u2019t know, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that\u2019s so deeply a part of your being that you can\u2019t even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.\u201d\nThe world is filled with sorrow and adventures. When home, we long to be somewhere else. When we are somewhere else, we long to be home. But what about those who have no home, who belong everywhere and nowhere? Port Morseby is such a man. He is a man of many lands. He doesn\u2019t stay faithful to any place, not even to his wife. Nor does she stay faithful to him. We see their marriage laid bare before us, a fragile thing that, strangely, in the end falls apart not because of the distance between them and all the third parties involved, but because his life is cut short by a disease. It is not his passion for other women that unties the knot, but his passion for the world. Port Morseby is a traveler. \n\"He did not think of himself as a tourist; he was a traveler. The difference is partly one of time, he would explain. Whereas a tourist generally hurries back home at the end of a few weeks or months, the traveler, belonging no more to one place than to the next, moves slowly, over periods of years, from one part of the earth to another.\"\nIt is books like this one that make you realize how vast and how small at the same time the world is. Our troubles follow us wherever we go. And there is always more. I read once in a book that our problems are like naughty children. Let them out and they inevitably come back with friends. He moves from one place to another with the ease a chameleon changes its colours, but his soul is transfixed. \n\u201cIf he had not the energy to ascertain his position in time and space, he also lacked the desire. He was somewhere, he had come back through vast regions from nowhere; there was the certitude of an infinite sadness at the core of his consciousness, but the sadness was reassuring, because it alone was familiar\"\"There\u2019s no reason to be afraid, but I am. Sometimes I\u2019m not here. Then I\u2019m far away and all alone. No one could ever get there. It\u2019s too far. And there I\u2019m alone. So alone I can\u2019t even remember the idea of not being alone. I can\u2019t even think what it would be like for there to be someone else in the world. When I\u2019m there I can\u2019t remember being here; I\u2019m just afraid. But here I can remember being there.\"\nNo world is vast enough to heal a restless soul. The world is only as big as we let it be. There is no sheltering sky. \n\"The landscape was there, and more than ever he felt he could not reach it. The rocks and the sky were everywhere, ready to absolve him, but as always he carried the obstacle within him. He would have said that as he looked at them, they ceased being themselves, that in the act of passing into his consciousness, they became impure. It was slight consolation to be able to say to himself: \u201cI am stronger than they.\u201d\nPort\u2019s wife, Kit, albeit lacking her husband\u2019s adventurous spirit, to me is an even more vivid and memorable character, albeit as tragic. Wherever her husband goes, she follows, but only out of sense of loyalty. A loyalty she preserves even in her moments of intimacy with their mutual friend Tunner. It is her soul\u2019s desire to please him and find a path to him. Maybe part of her failure to do so is due to the fact that she does not know where she comes from. Not only that she lacks her husband\u2019s impetuousness, but she struggles to preserve even a relative amount of self-confidence. She is afraid to be herself, she is afraid to take responsibility, to make a choice, to be alive. \n\"She once had thought that if he should die before she did, she would not really believe he was dead, but rather that he had gone back inside himself, and that he never would be conscious of her again; that it would be she who would have ceased to exist. She would be the one who had entered partially into the realm of death, while he would go on, an anguish inside her, a door left unopened, a chance irretrievably lost\"\nUnfortunately, her prediction comes true. She is captured physically and emotionally. She accepts what comes to her afterwars, she even manages to persuade herself that she enjoys it. As I told a GR friend recently, sometimes we tend to accept something, persuade ourselves that it is natural, that we love it, because it is easier than accepting the status of a victim, the reality of who or what we have become. Here is what I told my friend Jeffrey as soon as I finished the book: \u201cWe all long for the comfort of not having to deal with responsibility and guilt, not to have to worry and constantly think things through and make choices. But what happens to her shows the price we sometimes pay for such \u201cfreedom\u201d. And even if we do happen to luck out and turn out into the hands of a reliable person, who wouldn\u2019t take advantage of us, it would still not be right laying all the responsibility on someone else. It might be hard to constantly make choices, but it is those choices that make us who we are.\u201dThe passage I open my review with, the fact that Port realizes that Kit is the most important thing for him only on his deathbed, the fact that she sees his death as \"chance irretrievably lost\" and Tunner's realization that Port had been his best friend only when he is already gone make me think about the often repeated saying that we tend to take things and people for granted and we realize their true value only when it's already too late. I had always thought \"So what? I need to spend every waking minute being on the edge? Why should my just enjoying what I've got, without thinking all the time of everything that might go wrong and the end of it all, mean that I don't appreciate it?\" It was only after reading this book that dawned on me that it is not about that. It is about making sure that you treat yourself and those around you the right way, that you end up with as little regrest as possible. Because, as Port says, \"how many more times will you watch the full moon rise?\"Despite my use of the words adventure and adventurous, this isn\u2019t an adventure book, it isn\u2019t even really about travelling. It is a book about two people being pushed to their limits. They fail. The journey does not have a happy ending. Kit faces challenges she cannot overcome. She is broken and defeated. But she is alive. And as long as there is life, there is hope.

Above this quote is another phrase: \"Tea in the Sahara,\" a chapter title, now-familiar but difficult to place. This was taken by none other than the band The Police, to introduce their own work, a song of the same name that recreates a story from The Sheltering Sky. It's an interesting little web - and indicative, I think, of the kind of impact that this book seems to have on people, or at least on those who love it.I did strange things because of this book. I bought leather-bound antique tomes written by T.E. Lawrence, and read them to a friend while wrapped in blankets and candlelight, hiding from a snowstorm, which we both pretended was sand and not ice. I became obsessed with the notions of breath and spirit that are espoused by the Touareg people of the Sahara desert. I planned films. I devoured the works of Isabelle Eberhardt, an early pioneer of female-gender-bending and exotic adventure. And finally, I bought a one-way ticket to Morocco to see Mr. Bowles, himself.What happened after that is a long story, and a large part of my psychic history. Bowles died three days before I arrived, although Fate did land me at his wake, and I became friends with many of his, most notably the famous Moroccan novelist, Mohammed Choukri. I also ended up living in North Africa for about two years, and spending a good deal of time in the desert, undergoing indeed what Bowles translates as the baptism of solitude.This is a long-winded way of saying that there is something special in this book, something that has the ability to get into you and never let you go. It makes you do things, it shakes you up and reminds you of emotions and fears that you had forgotten to give names to. And as the Mallea quote suggests, this book does nothing to you that you haven't already in some way done to yourself, or brings out nothing that wasn't already there, some other, wilder experience, some other collision with the real, and the you that you have forgotten or think you have lost.For those who have watched or loved the film adaptation, I cannot speak to it as I've never been able to bring myself to see it. I am not a big fan of Bertolucci's work, although he does do some interesting things with silence. Bowles' comment on the film was something to the effect of, \"How can you make a movie when all the action takes place inside people's heads?\""}, {"userName": "Steven  Godin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26706841-steven-godin", "userReview": "This has destroyed me!, an utterly devastating work of immense power where the frailties of life both physically and emotionally are pushed to the very limits in a hostile, dangerous and unforgiving land.Having settled in Tangier in the late 40's Paul Bowles uses his knowledge and experiences of French North Africa to startling effect. American couple Kit and Port Moresby have a marriage that is disintegrating and feel a trip abroad could help repair their relationship, so to avoid a ravaged Europe following the second world war decide to travel through Algeria with their friend Tunner in tow, who clearly has some strong feelings for the beautiful Kit, things were never going to work out as hoped. There are Train journeys and bus rides through stunning but harsh landscapes with deserts, valleys, and rugged terrain where the unrelenting heat of the sun is a constant factor during the days, but it's when staying in the small towns where the reel problems start to arise, with general bickering, kit's uncomfortable mood towards their surrounding taking hold and Port disappearing into the night, as couples go it only seems likely they will drift further apart with no signs of happiness on the horizon. Slowly an uneasiness starts to creep in, with figures lurking in the shadow's of dark passageways, strange looks from locals they can never be certain about, with fly's buzzing, dogs barking, small children crying, there is a building paranoia, and Paul Bowles does make everything out in a stark, desolate, but realistic way similar to say Cormac Mcarthy, so if your looking for joy it does not exist here, as there were a few passages of writing in particular quite early on of such bleakness I had to go over them again as just couldn't believe my eyes, so he does not exactly portray a place where one would wish to hang around for too long. While the first half reads like a travel novel this would only go on to set the scene for when events take a turn into something of almost unbearable tensions that has quite frankly left me shattered."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\u201cHow fragile we are under the sheltering sky. Behind the sheltering sky is a vast dark universe, and we're just so small.\u201d \u2015 Paul Bowles, The Sheltering SkyPaul Bowles masterpiece reminds me of some alternate, trippy, version of Fitzgerald's Tender Is the Night, but instead we see the other side of the Mediterranean. Tangier and the deserts of North Africa take the place of the South of France. A different love triangle exposes different forms of loneliness, madness, love, and existential expats.The thing I love about Bowles is he brings a composer's mind to writing. His novel isn't propelled forward by a strong plot (although it has plot) or attractive characters (none of the characters are very attractive), but the music of his language alone pushes and pulls, tugs and compels the reader page after page. It felt very much like I was floating limp and languid in Bowles prose as his hypnotic sentences washed over me and drifted me slowly toward the inevitable end.Most days, I don't feel a real need to read a book twice.

I had already decided that, if one of the Fiennes brothers wasn't available, Colin Firth-as-Darcy or Viggo Mortensen-as-Aragorn would serve as adequate replacements. Better yet, let's just add them to the plot.But, even though this story takes place in French Africa, and there is a fantastic French word available to describe these complicated gatherings of three. . .

I could not stomach the husband's relentless fear of death and penchant for whining, nor the wife's lack of color or passion for anything. These characters are so damned spoiled, so quintessentially the \u201cugly Americans,\u201d they can't even see past their own noses that they live the most enchanted and fantastical lives. As a reader, it is hard to suffer with or relate to any of them, especially when they feel damned whenever their cocktails arrive without ice (ahem, in the desert).I swear to you. . .

Rejecting America and Europe in post WWII disgust, these \"travellers\" (not tourists, Port is adamant about the difference) hope to find meaning in the mystery of the Sahara.It doesn't take long for something of a love triangle to form (or a love rectangle, if we're going to count Port's nightly wanderings). It also doesn't take long for the mood of the inscrutable desert to permeate the travellers. It shows how weak the bonds of marriage, friendship and sanity are, as the swirling dunes undo these societal ties with their mesmerizing magic. The descent leaves each person to their own limited devices, an internal struggle and terrifying defeat.Death is always on the way, but the fact that you don't know when it will arrive seems to take away from the finiteness of life. It's that terrible precision that we hate so much. But because we don't know, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well.The characters struggle with their connections with each other, fighting an urge to repair love with an equal urge to keep at arm's length. Truly separate, desolately alone, blind attempts at physical closeness punctuate the book, lending it a sensuality, with an edge. Now that he owned her completely, there was a new savageness, a kind of angry abandon in his manner. The bed was a wild sea, she lay at the mercy of its violence and chaos as the heavy waves toppled upon her from above. Why, at the height of the storm, did two drowning hands press themselves tighter and tighter about her throat? Tighter, until even the huge grey music of the sea was covered by a greater, darker noise - the roar of nothingness the spirit hears as it approaches the abyss and leans over.This wouldn't be a complete review if I didn't use the descriptor 'hypnotic' when referring to Paul Bowles' writing. While the plot isn't particularly strong, the mood and atmosphere is engulfing and drenches every word, every buzzing fly, every bewildered expression, every stolen kiss.

His sentences whispered in my ear and nibbled my nape, erasing thought from my haze-addled brain. Later, many days later, I came to with a throbbing headache and a sour taste in my mouth. The crystal turned out to be crystal meth and it had severely eroded my judgement. What I had taken to be beautiful and enticing was just a jaded street hustler peddling the same old weary goods that had been around the block just too many times: naive privileged Westerners seek the purity of the savage wilderness, only to be destroyed by the horror, the horror of the eternal Om. Yes, I get it. The bleak landscape of the Saharan desert substitutes here for the bleak desert of the American suburban landscape (see, for example, American Beauty). Protective veneers are stripped away to reveal the isolation and alienation at the heart of Kit, Port and their relationship. I can even get why people might love it. But what gets me is the notion that in this Bowles was somehow being hard-nosed, rejecting romanticism. It may perhaps be a rejection of a particular romantic notion that salvation via the Essential and the Real are to be found outside civilization (see, for example, Kerouac). But this view of the Other as that blind unfeeling un-West that shreds the corrupt deracinated white man is just disguised romanticism, a precious existentialist reading of civilization by someone who can afford to pooh-pooh it, who is not going to have to dodge murdering soldiers to get water or till a parched field to feed his family. Make no mistake, I'm no apologist for the ills of rampant capitalist consumerism nor some fool lover of the anomie that is corporate life. But life is what it is. If you're going to go to Africa and not get your shots, you're a damn fool. And you'd be just as much a fool if you'd tried scaling the north-face of the Matterhorn in the nude, notwithstanding it's proximity to consumerist, luxury-stuffed St Moritz.

Whatever value the book still has, it's in the language, which I myownself found very close to intolerably dull and lifeless.I suppose I have to give this Ambien-between-covers two stars because there will be lynch mobs of admirers outside my door anyway, but if I gave it the 1/2 star I think it actually deserves, there'd be snipers and Inquisitionists too.

My wife and I were on a 10 day trip to Morocco and I suggested that we read The Sheltering Sky in tandem. Bowles tale of existential dread and Western culture collision with the desert and denizens of North Africa was supposed to be a fictional journey to parallel our actual one. It wasn\u2019t.Bowles\u2019 now relatively famous distinction between a traveler and a tourist is an artifice. It is part of the genius of this novel in that the Reader takes Bowles position on traveler/tourist and then watches to see how the three American characters behave according to Bowles\u2019 rules, all the while reflecting on how differently I would behave. Another important difference between tourist and traveler is that the former accepts his own civilization without question; not so the traveler, who compares it with the others, and rejects those elements he finds not to his liking. How quaint a notion, offered so early in the novel. Read to see how American civilization frays at the edges beneath that sheltering sky; watch what happens when the so called \u201ctraveler\u201d rejects elements not to his liking.We finished reading the novel and discussed it over dinner. The next morning we would leave for three days in the Atlas mountains with the Berbers. Our conversation weaved between our thoughts on Kit, Moresby and Tunner and our excitement of the impending unknown spending time with another culture, completely off the grid and out of our comfort zone. Life held a different plan for us, however, and the next morning we were frantically trying to find a western hospital with a medical emergency that was no joke. Within minutes our Western Bubble was pierced \u2013 we were no longer in the beautiful hotel with room service and candlelight dinners, we were in a taxi with a driver that spoke no English rushing to a Marrakesh hospital in a place no tourist nor traveler would ever choose to be. This day also happened to be the Eid al-Fitr celebration, so the hospital had minimum staff and a waiting room filled to capacity. Nobody spoke English, my monoglotism shaming me yet again. My wife needed immediate medical attention, French and Arabic were only spoken at the intake desk, and all these Marrakeshians also trying to get admittance are looking at me like I\u2019m from another planet. I was losing my patience, I was frightened, I realized that in that moment there was nothing that any part of my Western civilization could offer me to help. I was experiencing a brutal intersection with Bowles\u2019 narrative; I was the clueless American in North Africa, the fifty year span between Bowles\u2019 characters and me might as well have been the same day experience. For I had done as Kit did attempting to build a pathetic little fortress of Western culture in the middle of the wilderness.Moresby asks himself if any American can truthfully accept a definition of life which makes it synonymous with suffering. I don\u2019t know whether to call myself a traveler or a tourist, but as I continue to visit other places on the planet and meet people from other cultures I attempt to brook my life filters to learn from them. I don\u2019t know suffering, not the way that most people that have lived \u2013 are living \u2013 have. The Sheltering Sky is a fine introduction to the beginning of that conversation, especially for Americans that travel. Kit mentions in Book Three that someone once told her that the sky hides the night behind it, that it shelters the person beneath from the horror that lies above. What is going to shelter us from everything beneath the sky?"}, {"userName": "trivialchemy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108138-trivialchemy", "userReview": "In my younger days, I sensed that this was a rudely under-appreciated book that, merely acclaimed, deserved inclusion within the canon of the Gods themselves (Hemingway, Melville, Joyce, McCarthy). More recently, I have realized that not the book qua narrative, but its singular intimacy with my person colored the profoundness of my love-affair with this novel. As a result, my review must be peculiarly subjective for someone so accustomed to the pretense of objectivity.Whether its effect on my life resulted from the epoch in which I read it (adolescence) or a nascent affinity I can not know. Either way, the very themes over which Bowles obsesses are the same which motivate the several pathologies of myself as man and human being. It's true that The Sheltering Sky is primarily a love story, yet one in which the desert itself -- its hajji, its pathogens, its sterile expanse -- serves as antagonist as much as the tension of refractory lovers. Bowles' position is thus one of the experientialist: that meaning derives from the experience, and without experience the life stands bereft of meaning. But there is much more to be said. For though Port and Kit's love is brought into this world as a burden, the promise is that the very foreignness of the land is what will bring it to resolution. This is not the myth of the expatriate (that the foreign place will cure all domestic malaise) but a more general principle: that the longer one can not find that which one seeks within the familiar, the more likely it lies in some place strange and horrible.And indeed they do find resolution, but not the one they knew themselves to be searching for. Instead, a resolution which leaves the reader as much as Bowles' protagonists haunted by the heaviness of love and chaos of the exotic. Perhaps what drew me most into this world and its ethos is Bowles' style itself, which matches with unnerving certainty the psychology of his characters to their external circumstance. In this way, a breathtaking comprehensiveness is stitched by prose at once robust and feminine, M\u00f6bius in its intention, Attic in its certainty. This correspondence between psychology and circumstance provides a veritable well of affect, both for the characters and the reader. As a consequence, The Sheltering Sky has not only inspired the sole piece of complete writing I ever authored, but assisted in authoring the much more sincere trajectory of my own experience.

The story revolves around the character of Port Moresby, who, in disillusioned response to WWII, rejects America and Europe, leaving NY for Africa with his wife Kit as well as an acquaintance named Tunner, whom they both dislike.Port feels Africa is less marred by war, and aims to spend a long period of time there. It\u2019s not that he would fit in, he just wants to escape, or disappear. He may hope to flee his emptiness, but unfortunately it\u2019s a very clingy travelling companion. While his grudge against his culture propels him abroad, removing whatever external irritations Port might find in New York, the desert confronts him with his own inner emptiness. Port seems to relish wallowing there, while dragging his wife along. She isn\u2019t one to protest \u2013 despite her unhappy state Kit seems devoted to Port, she bends to him, she bites her tongue and she packs her bags and comes. Other than facing the landscape\u2019s reflection of one\u2019s inner desolation, you can\u2019t help but wonder what appeal Africa holds. Port, Kit and Tunner find mostly squalor \u2013 ferocious flies, pink hairless dogs, wailing babies covered in sores, garbage in hotels, and caf\u00e9s that smell of urine. But Port doesn\u2019t care about sight-seeing or how many stars a hotel has: he\u2019s a \u201ctraveller,\u201d not a \u201ctourist.\u201d And he is the engine for the whole unfortunate story, even though he does manage to take his leave midway through the book. At the end of Book 1, Port visits a teahouse, where he gets the hots for a blind prostitute/dancer. Her expressionless face while dancing says to him, \u201cA dance is being done. I do not dance because I am not here. But it is my dance.\u201d That peace is very much what Port seems to want. He is also attracted to this particular dancer because her blindness means she cannot see him. She erases him.It all goes downhill from there. In general, I thought the writing of The Sheltering Sky was good and the themes were interesting and important and are generally themes I like. I would have taken a philosophical point of view if the offensive handling of Kit as a woman hadn\u2019t pushed my feminist button so hard it still hasn't popped back out. First off, I realize the book was written in that late 1940s, but the use of the word \u201cgirl\u201d to describe Kit grated on me immediately. I could have chalked it up to the times and shrugged it off. Even her attachment to clothes and wearing lipstick didn\u2019t seem to me unrealistic.  And ... here comes the SPOILER so stop here if you don\u2019t want to know more about the plot...  When Port dies, Kit\u2019s own \u201csheltering sky\u201d collapses and she is confronted with herself pure and unmitigated. Again here I\u2019d be inclined to read this as an existential story if it weren\u2019t for what Kit turns out to be. I found it too much to take that after Port\u2019s death she waves down a caravan to save her and goes on to enjoy being raped by two men, soon becoming a contented sex slave to one of them. Coming to her senses briefly, she escapes that fate too, only to screw the next available guy. I don\u2019t like the message here \u2013 woman as neurotic, male-defined nymphomaniac. I disliked the double standard throughout the book, e.g. after Port stumbles home from sleeping with a prostitute he\u2019s outraged when he suspects Kit slept with Tunner. I could rave on and on about this, but suffice it to say at this point, as a woman I was offended."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129974-jessica", "userReview": "I rarely don't finish a book.

I wonder how she got that; he seemed like such a cheerful guy. \u201cThe Sheltering Sky\u201d is a story of two (sometimes three) American drifters, who consider themselves \u201ctravellers\u201d (rather than primitive tourists, you know), in search of something in North Africa \u2013 themselves? The meaning of it all? But end up, of course, losing themselves completely for they didn\u2019t realise they are just a sum of social conventions, beliefs and rituals. And once the sun dries it up, all of it flakes away and \u201cthe sheltering sky\u201d cannot shelter them from the emptiness inside them.The main couple, Port and Kit, in their sexless but not entirely loveless marriage, resemble somewhat Paul and Jane\u2019s unorthodox marriage (they only tried sex for about 1.5 year, after which she went on to sleep with women, he mostly with men, but they remained devoted to each other). And of course, Paul Bowles knows Sahara because he lived in its vicinity most of his life and infected his characters with the yearning for the desert. Personally, the endless sandy dunes never held much appeal to me but reading this beautifully written book almost convinced me that there was some value in the solitude of Sahara.Like the characters in the meta-story \u2018Tea in Sahara\u2019, told to Port by a prostitute, Kit and Port keep looking for some illusive thing, that unspecified perfection that might be behind the next dune. What really propels Port forward is the fact he finds himself in constant psychological discomfort in every single place he is, so he tries to outrun himself. Kit, on the other hand, tags along hunted (and haunted) by bad omens she sees everywhere (you can tell the old girl is about to lose it). As I mentioned, the writing is generally beautiful, and the characterization is also wonderful, but that doesn\u2019t mean Bowles isn\u2019t occasionally prone to bombastic, existentialist phrases such as \u201chumanity is everyone but yourself\u201d or something in that vein \u2013 I haven\u2019t noted the exact quote. However, I do have a soft spot for such borderline pretentious existentialism. And Bowles is good at pacing. He was a composer first and the pacing of this book reminds me of a classical piece that start lazily and gently, gets a little intense in the middle and ends with chaotic cacophony. I liked it much better than any Hemingway I\u2019ve read but I appreciate it might not be for everyone. If the book isn\u2019t for everyone, the moral of it is: get your travel vaccinations, kids.

Someday I will have to revisit this, as I seem to mention it to anyone or anything who is willing to listen. Has probably become my favorite book of all time: simultaneously capturing the utter loneliness of existence, and the strange beauty of the desert/and/or the foreign. Makes me want to travel, makes me want to stay home and hide under the covers...it's that good. I've read almost all of Bowles' other stuff, and some of it comes close to this (especially Let it Come Down), but what comes off as simply cruel in the other work here becomes sublime. I remember someone reminding me that Bowles started out as a composer, and it really shows in the writing. Everything is considered and in its right place on the page to create credible characters and situations. I can't think of any other writer aside from Henry James who captures the strange feeling of being an American in a foreign land. I'm going to have to read it again this summer. As of October 08: read it again recently. Time does strange things to one's reviews. So the Paul Bowles character (the man-I don't remember his name now) is friggin' annoying and deserves what he gets. The Jane character however-it really is all about her and what she does. What my 20-something brain latched onto and what my 30-something brain latches onto are two totally different things. It's all about Kit: Kit's assimilation (or lack thereof), Kit's hopes, fears, desires to change, to metamorph-osize (metamorph? metamorphose?). The other characters are just vehicles and supports to get her to that last page. Everything else falls away. The husband's wanderings, his pontifications-blather.

Sometimes taken out back and put out of their misery. I don't think she's wrong, exactly. So I've been thinking about this in the back of my mind as a bone. Paul Bowles could out-walk the run of death drums of too much psych weight by the background noise. The music that lives this. The people could try and hold your body in front of theirs to ward off the meaningless. I would sit there and pray to something I can't make for myself out of myself alone to please put down the sticks to poke me with. Please kick your infinitesimal sands somewhere else.

I know and could talk myself into the writerly decisions. It's just Port and Kit, true to them and their man made walls. It makes sense that Kit philosophical backseats her destiny with them between her legs because Bowles told me all along that she did this. He led me to where there was no door to Port's being. But I don't want to talk myself into believing it. Bowles has done more than this. I freaking loved The Spider's House. He could have made them the carcass buzzing with flies more than the vampiric let me in voice. I think these days I would do anything to avoid that. I know that when Port has to ravel in his reveling solitudes. I can hear the silence and there are voices that speak to me. I don't want to give the answers.

Love it. The richness of the character portraits, relationships, and existential themes; as well as the startling detail of the images are highlighted even more by knowing the ending.Back with more ... heading into Part II.12/28/08: A piece of writing by Donald Powell [link now dead-sorry!:] caused me to think about this book, and my very different response to it from when I first read it in my early 20s to 20 years later, when I am--ahem--not in my early 20s.Back then, the existential theme was all-important: I believe I may have read the entire book for its symbolism, more than its story or characters, which I pointed out as important above but which I don't even recall thinking about back then. Then, I was all head and very little heart (unusual for a 20-yr-old, I know) and now--forgive me if I become too autobiographical--with loves, lives and deaths having been personally and deeply experienced as opposed to merely read of and superficially dallied with, I am the reverse. Mostly all heart--slightly damaged and battered but all the more resilient for it--and much less head (or a head filled with shades of gray that cause me, or allow me depending on your POV, to see depths and angles that I was unable to see as a young'un).These are the benefits of age, and this book is a shining example of what I was trying to say in my brief review of Donald's partial defense of Henry Miller: the ability of a writer and a story to have an impact on one's life in very different ways at different times marks the author as a prodigious talent, and says something too about our capacity for growth and change as human beings (because, of course, what we bring to the story is as or more important than what the story brings to us).In other words, this book stands up well to the test of time.On my second reading, I turned down just about every page of this book for quotations, character interactions and images of startling beauty and angst. I've now loaned my copy out, so can't reproduce any of these here--you'll just have to trust me. But, three reasons you should read this book, if you haven't:1) If you are an existential atheist, like me: There is no more compelling argument than in the stories of Port and Kit Moresby for how we must create meaning in our lives absent any particular spiritual or religious faith grounding us in the universe. Bowles uses every tactic possible to strip each of these characters from their time, place, culture and--finally--each other, so that they can simply \"be\" in the world (looking up at the sheltering--but empty--sky, natch), and confront the fullness of what that means. Not that it turns out at all well for either of them, but it packs a wallop of a moral for the reader.2) If you are a diehard romantic, like me: These characters yearn, and squirm, and sigh, and strive, and flail, and grasp for but never reach anything they desire. Not answers to any of the very big questions they are asking, and not each other. I recall my focus being on Port in my 20s; in my more recent reading, I was far more interested in Kit. And I was fascinated by the portrait of this very unique marriage: Bowles does an astonishing job of shifting the POV from Port to Kit as they try to communicate but end up talking around each other and missing completely the connection they so desperately seek (there again is the symbolism interacting with the personal stories). Port and Kit are each portraits of inner conflict and turmoil--so much so that I would forgive those who might scoff that they become caricatures of the angst-ridden, post-war hero and heroine who embody \"All That Is Wrong With Modern Society.\" No matter, put it aside: yes, the novel is slightly dated but only insofar as it is set so specifically in that time and place. The setting is required, and particularly apt, to explore the deeper themes. Rather than characters, Kit and Port are to me archetypes: a couple that need each other desperately but, because they are so isolated in body, spirit and mind, they cannot be together. This is a deeply romantic and bleakly existential tale of what it means to be irredeemably alone in the universe: timeless, not time-stamped. 3) If you are both, like me: The Sheltering Sky is an existential thought experiment, but although it takes its philosophy very seriously, it never sacrifices the story for it. Credit Bowles' mastery of images and dialogue--his knack for introducing a subtly gruesome piece of horror (usually found floating in the soup) or a startling, stumbled-upon scene (like a naked man bathing in the desert). These invariably have deep symbolic importance, but even if you choose not to pause and reflect on what that might be, their effects will be felt. The story becomes mirage-like and hallucinatory, like a malaria-induced fever. Or should that be typhoid? I leave it to you to find out.Two more things:DO have a listen to the Sting song, Tea in the Sahara, taken from a particularly poignant (and of course oh-so-symbolic) digression in the book.DO NOT, at all costs, even think about renting the appalling movie.

Is he selling us existentialism through this novel? Perhaps. What is he saying about the central couple\u2019s relationship, both with each and with their friends? This too is unclear. The two main protagonists are trying to reach out to each other, but do they succeed? This circles back to the author\u2019s philosophical message. Perhaps it is enough that the book draws our attention to these questions. The answers are not clear.What does the author want to say with the title? This too is unclear, but worth discussion. The first half of the book is very different from the second half. I do not feel the two hold together. The first half focuses on philosophy. The first half has many parallels with Camus\u2019 \u201cThe Stranger\u201d. Both are set in Africa, one in Morocco and the other in Algeria. There is a streetcar in both. In neither is it the individuals that control their lives, but rather the other way around. Life just happens and you must submit. The second half has a completely different style of writing. You switch from philosophical analysis to a plot oriented, adventure story reminiscent of \u201cOne Thousand and One Nights\u201d. Depending on your preferences you will like one or the other\u2026..but not both. The audiobook narration by Jennifer Connelly is very well done. She distinguishes between English and American characters. They do make you smile\u2026. Maybe this is because I now live in Europe? French, English and Arabic languages are used; this is done adroitly. The languages are not translated. Although I don\u2019t see this as a problem, I was happy that I easily understood the French. The slang chosen felt genuine; that is exactly how people would express themselves. A central theme of the book is the difference between travelers and tourists. In fact this is why I chose the book, having myself lived in different countries. The main protagonists see themselves as travelers, but I felt they acted often as tourists. Rather than being curious about a new environment and culture they were d-i-s-g-u-s-t-e-d and apathetic. They couldn\u2019t possibly have thought that the difficulties that arose and the filth they saw were anything but to be expected! They seemed to be looking for a clean problem free journey. This seems terribly illogical. Part of this IS explained by the difference between the man and the women, and it is interesting to consider which one of them really was the \u201ctraveler\u201d. There are loose ends in this novel, characters thrown in that one cannot fully understand. What happens to them is left completely unresolved. Nope this was not well done. There is quite a bit that can be discussed in this book, but I can only give it two stars. It was not terrible, but just OK."}, {"userName": "Clif Hostetler", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler", "userReview": "[In the end the female character hitches a ride with a camel caravan to Sudan, seems to not mind serving as a sex slave to a wealthy merchant, and at the conclusion appears border-line incoherent when returned to civilization.

The word that kept flashing in my mind throughout the book is detachment. The unlikable main characters are detached from one another and so is the reader from them. Their personalities, just like their most personal and hidden thoughts, are laid out in front of the reader like shadowplay watched from afar, thus never close enough to actually make connection. Of course, it's deliberately made that way and it's part of the book's essence but it's not a style that works for everyone. After the middle, the story takes a turn toward the darker, the more obscure side of the human mind. Admittedly, Bowles has made a hell of a job depicting the guilts and the ultimate self-punishing that derive from the aforementioned detachment. The funny thing is, the more I write about it, the more I see the genius in this novel. The fact remains, though, that reading it felt like reading about something I didn't really care about (that was a weird sentence). That said, it's still a book I'd recommend to most people."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "A very unhappy tale of Americans in post WWII North Africa \u2013 They are unable to cope with this very strange world and are consumed by it. Port Moresby and his wife, Kit, along with traveling companion Tunner wander French North Africa, seeking adventure of a civilized sort. They are morally impaired \u2013 Port visits a prostitute; Kit has an affair with Tunner\u2014and suffer as well from the physical location. Port ultimately contracts a fatal disease, and Kit goes mad, becoming a slave to a local. In addition they are befriended by a very odd young Brit and his mother. She never stops complaining. He manages to rob them. Corrupt French officials complete this very dark tale of naivet\u00e9 destroyed by ignorance. Interestingly written, and filled with a dark view of America in a hostile world, as personified by these people. It does not hold the Americans in high regard either.
