I used to consider these books a good guilty pleasure; now I find there's a lot less pleasure and a lot more guilt. Kinsella is still an amusing, energetic writer, but Becky really grated on my nerves this time around. She's just so shallow and so frivolous, and while in the first few books she was also just a regular working girl, now that she's rich (thanks entirely to her husband), her insane overspending and materialism swiftly loses its charm and becomes...icky. It can be difficult to read a whole book about someone you would probably feel uncomfortable having lunch with.So, while I still think there's a...certain charm to these books, and that they're in many ways better than a lot of chick lit, I also just don't think they're for me anymore. I've become too old and cranky to enjoy them. They belong to a part of my life that no longer exists (in which, for example, I also secretly owned an Avril Lavigne CD)."}, {"userName": "Zo\u00eb", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9303625-zo", "userReview": "Book 31/100"}, {"userName": "Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/937415-morgan", "userReview": "this was my favorite of the whole series. partly because she doesn't do anything completely ridiculous, and you can see that she is learning and growing and communicating more, even if it's not as much as she should. i seriously love how becky and suze refer to people they don't like as \"cows\". maybe it's an english thing, but it seems like such a random choice of words. even though all along you know how kind hearted, fun and well meaning becky is, i love how it comes out even more in this book. i am a forever hopeless romantic, so i love the many becky and luke moments in this book, and i LOVE the end. i love that becky has grown and matured, but is still the same old becky who loves to shop, and always will. and i love that she is a mom."}, {"userName": "Claudia", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11729290-claudia", "userReview": "Okay, how do I feel about this series?Dear Becky, Just quick question; why are you so dumb? I don't mean to offend you because academically you seem fine, but the general rule of intelligence is to learn from your mistakes. Have you EVER learned from your mistakes? People around you are aware you're spoiled and shallow and irresponsible but you just can't help yourself can you?Luke could probably do better, but he obviously loves you and that is truly what is important. I do actually quite like your relationship - except for the secrets! You're aware that you should have an honest, open relationship but it's near impossible for you to manage it! Come on!However, I do love pregnant you, and I think you'll make great mum. Hopefully you and Luke get out of your economical problems soon because you will need all the money you can get to support both you and Minnie's shopping. Another thing: Minnie? The name. WHY?I'm sorry, but I just really detest that name. It's like you're asking for your daughter to be a brat. And she will be. Now, Becky, you're loved and you love.

Due to a lack of alternative entertainment, I read the book from cover to cover. While the book had some funny excerpts, my extreme dislike for the main character (Becky Brandon) overshadowed any enjoyment garnered from the book.Rather than being lovable, I found Becky to be irresponsible, annoying and pretentious. For example, after Becky's husband explains that his company is \"hemorrhaging money\" and asks her to reign in her spending, Becky responds by hiding her purchases from him. How very responsible of her, indeed.Of course, I realize the book is of the chick lit genre, but it would have been nice to have a modicum of reality intermixed with the fiction.To me, Becky represents the irresponsible consumerism that has resulted in the current credit crisis, and frankly, I don't find anything laughable about that.

Sophie Kinsella is a really funny writer. She has sustained the Shopaholic idea through more sequels than most writers can. However, this book (and the previous one, Shopaholic and Sister) isn't as spot-on as the first two. I mean, isn't Becky ever going to learn to stop overspending? Every book involves her getting in a financial hole, then reforming at book's end, only to start over again in the next book. And of course, now that she's married to a rich guy, it's not quite so nervewracking when she maxes out her credit card. It IS true that when you have your first baby, you buy all kinds of things you didn't know you \"needed,\" and the part of the book when Becky learns about \"baby couture\" and decides she needs multiple strollers is fun.

I don't want to spend a great deal of time catching you up on the whole series (check past blogs or Amazon for details), but in this installment Becky & Luke are pregnant with their first child. Like usual, Kinsella throws us right into it with three little words: \"Ok. Don't panic.\"Becky's spending habits seem to have toned down as she's gotten older and settled into married life, but even so her shopping gene flares in Pram City and the baby fair and becoming Vogue's number one Yummy Mummy! Then of course there's the major obstacle: the baby's sex! How can she possibly properly shop for the child unless she knows what it's going to be? Solution: get stuff for both!As per usual, there is some crisis to overcome for Becky (creditors, journalists, Luke's ex's, family, etc.) and this time trouble comes in the form of a redheaded obstetrician all the celebrity mummies use (who just happens to be Luke's college girlfriend). It's difficult to tell if something is really going on between Luke and Venetia or not because her hormones are out of whack. Plus Luke can't see how Cruela De Venetia is out to get Becky on a fashion level because he's too busy trying to save his PR company from complete ruin. House hunting, pregnancy, the usual monetary panic, plus the private eye Becky hires have got her frazzled.This was a fun chick-lit read -- not as great as the first two, but definitely better than the last. I wonder if this will be the last in the series. In my opinion it ought to be, but I wouldn't be surprised to see another somewhere down the road."}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1002168-sally", "userReview": "In this book, Rebecca and Luke are expecting their first child.

Despite not being the biggest fan of babies I wanted to read the book to see what makes the author so popular. I liked the subjects raised in the book - some of the issues are potentially very real but I was largely disappointed, not by the story or plot lines, but how the book was written overall. Kinsella repeats a LOT of words -I swear I read the word 'Incredulous' over a thousand times. Her descriptions are vague as well. She also uses certain phrases that she repeats endlessly. In the end it got very annoying. I thought the last couple of chapters were very poor indeed. Kinsella writes good stories but I don't see why she has to make the character's antics so utterly unbelievable at the end. I also noticed lack of depth in certain characters and I realised the author had used the same names here as in her previous books.

Becky and Luke are back from their extended holiday/honeymoon and Becky is pregnant with their first child. Since discovering that \u2018shopping cures morning sickness\u2019 she\u2019s been determined that their baby will have the best of everything, in true Becky Bloomwood style. And that includes the best OB-GYN.The best OB-GYN is Venetia Carter, who looks after pregnant models, stars, etc and Becky is determined to get an appointment. Luke, her husband, isn\u2019t so sure and thinks they should stick with his family OB-GYN but eventually agrees to go along with Becky to a preliminary appointment. Venetia Carter turns out to be an old friend of Luke\u2019s from Cambridge who he even dated for a little while. Becky is suddenly apprehensive about having Venetia as her OB-GYN but Luke, delighted to catch up with an old friend, now decides that they should stay with Venetia.Before long, Luke and Venetia are catching up, re-living their University days, meeting up with all their old Cambridge friends and exchanging texts in Latin. Becky starts to wonder if this, coupled with Luke\u2019s suddenly jumpy, secretive behaviour, means he\u2019s having an affair. Life is a bit stressful at the moment, with the baby coming, as they\u2019re currently homeless. They\u2019ve sold Luke\u2019s flat where they have been living and are looking for the perfect house but there is nothing around to their specifications. Becky has a new job with London fashion store The Look, which tanked spectacularly and is losing money hand over fist. They need to come up with something to get the buyers in fast or they\u2019ll all be out of a job. Becky has the idea to call in her former Manhattan-neighbour-turned-famous designer Danny Kovitz to design an exclusive piece for The Look that will have fashionistas pouring through the door. Danny turns up demanding an absolutely outrageous rider and the full star treatment, costing The Look more money than ever, making Becky\u2019s gamble an even bigger one.I\u2019ve enjoyed the Shopaholic books I\u2019ve previously read/listened to immensely but this one did fall a fraction flat for me, and I think that was primarily about how utterly stupid and frustrating Luke was. He\u2019s supposed to be a very intelligent man and he didn\u2019t get that his wife was a bit insecure about his ex-gf being her OB-GYN, even if she was the one that was all the rage. He went out catching up with her, spending time with her alone, and took Venetia\u2019s advice even when it was blatantly obvious that she was trying to make Becky uncomfortable. You always, always, always back your wife over any previous gf, even if she is a doctor. Did he not consider that Becky\u2019s blood pressure was slightly elevated because of Venetia? Apparently not. And he keeps something from her in this book that I\u2019m sure he does for all the right reasons (trying to save her stress, because of aforementioned slightly high blood pressure) but all it does is make him look ragingly guilty of having an affair, which actually makes her even more stressed out and upset. If he\u2019d actually told her what was worrying him in the beginning, then a whole lot of mess could\u2019ve been avoided. But keeping huge secrets is part of this series (like Becky does in Shopaholic Ties The Knot) and although it often makes for humorous situations, this one made for more frustrating situations than humorous ones for me. What did make up for it was how utterly awesome Luke was at the end when the penny finally dropped that Becky was insecure and that Venetia was deliberately contributing to that. That was definitely the Luke Brandon of Confessions of a Shopaholic. That was definitely how a husband should act when encountering a woman like Venetia! So there were big points for that, it\u2019s just a shame he was a bit stupid throughout the rest of the book.Still though, this book was a fun and light-hearted read. These books are great for picking up when you just want something to chill on the couch with and not have to think about. They\u2019d be perfect for the beach in summer and they\u2019re perfect for me on a cold winter\u2019s day when I\u2019m snuggled up on the couch with a blanket and it\u2019s like, 4 degrees outside and bucketing with rain."}, {"userName": "Angelakfox", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2813093-angelakfox", "userReview": "The Reader\u2019s Advisory class I\u2019m taking necessitates that I assign Sophie Kinsella\u2019s Shopaholic series to a genre; by measuring it against the criteria presented in Joyce Saricks The Readers\u2019 Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction, I can confidently declare it part of the \u201cWomen\u2019s Lives and Relationships\u201d genre. It is told from a women\u2019s perspective (protagonist and titular shopaholic, Rebecca Bloomwood), set in contemporary times (modern day London), and generally optimistic and upbeat (Becky\u2019s happy ending is never truly in doubt). But as Saricks herself points out, the problem with describing \u201cwomen\u2019s fiction\u201d as a genre is that is the wide variety of work that can be found within. There are books written in every tone, crossed with every other genre. There are books by Serious Writers tackling Serious Issues in thought-provoking, literary ways\u2026\u2026and then there is the Shopaholic series.To be fair, someone picking up a book with \u201cshopaholic\u201d in the title is probably not looking for the next Great Novel of our Time. The title, the brightly colored cover art, the playful typeface: everything about the book promises a light, easy \u201cbeach read,\u201d and Shopaholic joyfully delivers. As is befitting a book in the \u201cWomen\u2019s Lives\u201d genre, Becky struggles with themes that are of special concern to women: family, friendships, and careers\u2014but her particular struggles come with many comic misunderstandings and a sort of literary slapstick humor. In this particular novel of Becky\u2019s misadventures, she finds herself gainfully employed as a personal shopper in a department store, happily married to her dream man, Luke Brandon, and expecting her first child. But when she insists on getting OB-GYN to the stars, Venetia Carter, she doesn\u2019t realize that she\u2019s inviting Luke\u2019s ex-girlfriend back into his life. Becky deals with her glamorous competitor while engaging in her usual shopping shenanigans, surrounded by a supporting cast of recurring characters from the previous three books. There is no real suspense here; it\u2019s hardly a spoiler to say that Becky triumphs in all endeavors while saving her employer, finding her dream home, and stumbling into a small fortune. And if Becky\u2019s ratio of actual talent incredible luck seems a bit skewed toward the unbelievable\u2026 well, it\u2019s still nice to see the good guys win. The very things that some critics will hate about the book\u2014the predictability, the stock characters, the increasingly ridiculous plot twists\u2014are the things that fans of the series will love.

This is the first I've read of any of the shopaholic books. I was aggravated by this book. How on earth could someone be so consumed with shopping and what other people think of them is beyond me. I don't think I'll ever understand. First off, Rebecca is impulsive and emotional. She's too over the top. Seems like every sentence she spoke had a note of excitement behind it. Honestly, I'm surprised she didn't have a miscarriage during her pregnancy. If it weren't for those raging hormones pulsing through her veins during this pregnancy maybe her thoughts wouldn't have been so cloudy. But I gather that this character is like this anyway.. pregnant or not. I won't be surprise by the time the last shopaholic book comes out that Rebecca Brandon had an aneurysm or stroke. I see why Luke kept her oblivious to his company struggles because she don't know how to take stressful news. And to make matters worse she was hell bent on getting a famous obstetrician, who happens to be Luke's ex girlfriend, to deliver their baby. Idiots! Luke needs a backbone at home.

First of all, I liked how Becky was pregnant, but maybe is Sophie had shown a little more maturity on the protagonists part, i would have believed that she was actually ready to be a mom.Also, there was basically no romance between Luke and Becky, which got to me.Another thing was that, Becky's shopping obsession was supposed to be something funny and something that shapened Becky to be who she was. However, I think the author made Becky a little dumb in this book. Just because Becky likes to shop doesn't mean she turns into a total ignorant dumbo. especiall since she's having a baby!Overall, I think the book was hilarious (especially the baby names bit!), but the protagonist ruined it for me. Becky had gone from bubbly, excitable and fun to read about, to stupid, inconsequental and immature. And, I'm sorry, but was Luke always so boring????Nice books, amazing writing, hilarious, but the character lacked too much depth for me..."}, {"userName": "Nina Draganova", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20038488-nina-draganova", "userReview": "\u041a\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433, \u043e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0411\u0435\u043a\u0438 , \u0449\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0435., \u0441 \u0445\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0442, \u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0432\u0442, \u0439\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u0442.\u043d. \u0427\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a \u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0433\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u044f\u0431\u0432\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0438\u0433\u0443\u0440\u044f\u0432\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u044a\u0434\u0435.\u0410 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0432\u0430 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0430 , \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0433-\u0446\u0430 \u0423\u043d\u0430\u0443\u0430\u0442\u0443\u043d\u0430 \u041e\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0434\u0435\u044f \u0411\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044a\u043d?\u0418\u043b\u0438 \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d ?\u0418\u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u043d\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \"\u041c\u0438\u0443 \u041c\u0438\u0443\" \u0434\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u0434\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0434 ?\u0411\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u0437\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430.\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0446\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0432\u0430."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30851867-anne", "userReview": "A first for me of the Sophie Kinsella Shopaholic series. I started off not sure if I'd like the heroine, Becky, who at first glance appeared shallow and only interested in the designer lifestyle. However as I got into the story I gradually warmed to her. What a quirky and lovable character, her adventures and misadventures showed her a a generous hearted girl, one upholding traditional family values in spite of her desire for all the designer gear for herself and her baby. There are many laugh out loud moments, and as I take my books out with me to read on the bus, when I go for a coffee in town or at the launderette, it makes all of these tasks so much more enjoyable as I sit there chuckling to myself. Even on days when I feel a little tired, all I need to pick me up is a read of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic and I start to cheer up.This is a comedy of errors. Becky registers with a celebrity obstetrician, and is determined to have a natural birth. There are letters from various retail outlets in reply to Becky's helpful suggestions and from the investment broker, advising her as to what constitutes a sensible investment and what doesn't. But Becky shrugs all of this off.An engaging story, with quirky and entertaining characters, from her husband Luke, her sisters, her parents and her numerous friends. I only read the very last line this evening, I now feel as though I'd like to read another Shopaholic novel. Definitely one worth reading, for anyone who needs some uplift and joy in their life, this is the book for you."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/592564-alison", "userReview": "This one starts out slow and aggravating -- as Becky Bloomwood so often does. I find the series slightly more annoying now that she's rich and her shopping affliction is less a real problem and more of just a pesky bad habit which her husband can constantly bail her out of. Oh hardy har har, Becky can't possibly choose just one stroller so she buys four uber-strollers when the rest of us struggle to afford one mediocre one that we can make do with. And for some reason, her marriage and relationship with her husband have always seemed a bit awkward to me. He's supposed to be this fantastically rich and intelligent entrepreneur, but yet he has the relationship smarts of a banana slug. But before I knew it this one had me hooked just like all the rest! By about the halfway point I couldn't put it down and finished it in one sitting. I even found myself laughing out loud at some points. If you're a fan of the series, this one is another fun read, although Kinsella has still never been able to recapture the charm of the original book. I don't so much *like* Becky anymore, as I just feel a bit sorry for her and hope things work out for her in the end. This installment is not perfect, by any means, but if you've made it this far with the series, it's still a good diversion for some light-hearted, purely frivolous reading."}, {"userName": "Love Fool", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29084789-love-fool", "userReview": "Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) is pregnant!
