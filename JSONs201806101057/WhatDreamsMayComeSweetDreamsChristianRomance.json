In fact, the book also begins in the middle of their relationship (though it appears to be the end). Additionally, Terry tells the story from both Scott and Susannah\u2019s perspective, and part of it is told in a semi-flashback (Scott rereads the emails Susannah had sent him while they were first getting to know each other). While this took a bit of getting used to, I ultimately really liked the format for this specific story.Susannah is really young but spiritually mature, and in her first few emails to Scott (who is older) you can see how sheltered she has been. (Not that this is a bad thing, just an observation) She unfortunately has to grow up quickly and take on the care of her sister Kitty who has cerebral palsy. (Kitty is a fabulous character, by the way! Such a great personality even without a spoken voice.) Her plans with Scott \u2013 whom she has still not met in person \u2013 are put on hold, and so are her dreams. And, by default, so are Scott\u2019s dreams.Their individual confusion is one I would guess many have experienced. That feeling of \u2018did I totally misread God and His plans for my life?\u2019 that can be common in your early twenties (or late adolescence). I absolutely could relate to their questions, their rethinking of what they thought they knew. I also really appreciated that their relationship was built on shared beliefs, shared goals, and falling in love with someone\u2019s heart \u2013 not their physical looks.Bottom Line: What Dreams May Come by Alana Terry is a sweet, light love story that explores what happens when we give our dreams to God and let Him dream His dreams for us. Grandma Lucy and Kitty stole the show for me, personally \u2013 their characters consistently made me smile and want to spend more time with them. You will root for Scott and Susannah to find a happily ever after, though it may take a different shape than you originally imagined, bringing you right alongside their story and how they feel, too.(I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book)first seen at Reading Is My SuperPower"}, {"userName": "Hope", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13246091-hope", "userReview": "I normally avoid Christian fiction, but decided to give this a try since (1) it's about missionaries, which is quite a switch from your typical romance novel, (2) I like epistolary novels and the blurb said letters were included, and (3) it was by an established author so it had less chance of being badly written.The author invested very little time in fleshing out her characters. And there are very few descriptions of people and places so it's hard to picture anything. (The one exception was the pink prom dress.)The praying and Bible verse quoting were so thick that it felt more like a sermon than a story.

For me, that\u2019s a little bit like what What Dreams May Come was like. Heart-wrenchingly beautiful, and at the same time painful to watch. And one that made it to near the top of my list for 2017 in the end.I expected a sweet romance when I picked this up, but instead I was given a novel with depths of grief and dashed dreams that completely blew me away. It wasn\u2019t that this story was deep, necessarily\u2014it was just good. And for me, I was able to relate to the main character, understand her pain and (SPOILER ALERT!) cheer when she finally got what she was wanting.Overall, this isn\u2019t a very deep book. But there are deep elements to it, so if you like something that\u2019ll make you think, something you can laugh (and maybe cry!) with, and something with a good romance, I think you\u2019d enjoy this story.

While you won\u2019t travel across the globe, your heart will travel on an unexpected journey all it\u2019s own.Susanna feels a called by God to be a missionary to the world. After high school she began working at the local assisted living facility, as a nursing aid. But her greatest heart\u2019s desire is to share the gospel to the world. She finds an missionary agency that offers a summer program, and this seems like the answer to her prayers. After a few emails and a phone call she feels a connection to the recruiter.Scott enjoys traveling the globe and supporting the missionaries. When he receives an email from a young lady on the other side of the country who seems to be on fire for God and have a deep longing for the mission field, he is surprised by the sudden connection he feels with her.I appreciated the strong faith in this story, the deep roots of prayer and the reminders of trusting God even in the hard times when things don\u2019t seem to be going as planned. The chapters alternate between telling the story from Susanna\u2019s point of view then Scott\u2019s point of view, and for me this switch back and forth was a bit choppy in places. However, by the end it all fits together.A story with a deep well of emotion and strong roots in faith. This sweet heart-warming story is sure to edify your convictions of sharing the gospel and to remind you that you don\u2019t have to travel the world to share the love of God. I give this story 3.5 stars and would recommend it to those who enjoy reading stories of tender love, and deep faith.(I receive complimentary books for review from publishers, publicists, and/or authors, including Netgalley.

I don't generally read books that run fully on romance, but I wanted to because I really like this author and the book is based on her real-life love story. I thought the author did a really good job of making it realistic (I mean, not that I would have thought it was realistic if it wasn't based on a true story), and not making it be all lovely-dovely. The romance was built on solid facts (as opposed to \"Oh, he's cute so I'll like him\"), and that makes me happy because I think that leads for a much stronger story.

Other times your heart knows what it wants to say but you brain can\u2019t turn that into words. This is the second time. I really enjoyed this book, with a background of truth, and a theme of faith. I enjoyed getting to know Susannah and Scott. This book steps into the end of their love story. They\u2019ve already fallen in love, via phone calls and emails. They\u2019ve yet to meet face to face. I wondered for chapters and didn\u2019t really find out what happened until about a third of the way through the book. And then \u2026 the overwhelming need to pass out a plethora of Gibbs\u2019 smacks began.Susannah was so very sheltered I wondered how she would function on an international mission stage. Away from home, without constant oversight, without guidance from her family. I enjoyed the changes between their two perspectives as each chapter started, though for the bulk of the book it was all Susannah as Scott was apparently reading her old emails. They were both characters of depth and a deep faith. They interacted with God like a best friend which was so refreshing \u2026 and sometimes really hard to do. They were both flawed, I mean not obviously, deeply, overwhelming flawed but flawed all the same. And they frustrated me to the core.I got bogged down in the story as they both kept lamenting about how they couldn\u2019t be together anymore. They both CONSTANTLY thought of little but the other. It almost felt whiny. I mean it wasn\u2019t whiny but it was. They both acted like their love was something they had to sacrifice for everyone else. And God. Susannah believed that in order to fulfill the promise she had made to her mother she had to sacrifice her love for Scott, her calling to missions, and even the core of herself. Scott believed that he had to sacrifice everything because Susannah said so. In all their prayers and inner monologues instead of asking God what the next step should be they were asking Him to take the love they had for each other. I mean really people?!?I loved the scenes with Grandma Lucy (I fell in love with her character in Beauty From Ashes) and the truth that only she can share. I wish she had played a bigger part in Susannah\u2019s story. I loved that even though Susannah\u2019s mother had passed away her new step-dad still stepped in and played a role in her and her sister\u2019s lives. There was so much to love in this book. But then I remember the whining and I have to step back a minute. There is a lot of truth to learn here. Truth about God as the father. Truth about God as a best friend. Truth about learning when to trust that God will carry you through to His perfect end. Truth that sometimes we all put words in God\u2019s mouth (so to speak) and instead of assuming that God has taken something from us we need to instead assume that God will show us the way.Now, bring on book two in the series!I was provided a complimentary copy of this book by CelebrateLit.

When I was offered to review Alana Terry's new book, What Dreams May Come, I couldn't wait. The description grabbed my attention and I knew this was going to be a great book. What surprised me the most was learning that she had written this story before her and her husband had met but it was their true life love story. This made me even more ready to read this book.\u00a0The story of Susannah and Scott is one that will pull you and have your heart melting. All Susannah longs for is to become a missionary and she is determined to follow God's calling for her life. She longs for the day that she can leave Orchard Grove and take the gospel to many nations. Scott loves his life and loves traveling while offering never-ending support to missionaries. He is a missionary recruiter. He receives Susannah's application and can tell the passion she has for becoming a missionary. This is one young lady he can't wait to meet.What Dreams May Come is the first book in Ms. Terry's new series, A Sweet Dreams Christian Romance. This is going to be a remarkable series, one you will definitely want to add to your bookshelves.

I loved the fact that Susannah and Scott didn't meet face to face until much later in the story. It was a great example to young couples today - you really need to get to know your potential partner before making a commitment such as marriage. Being separated like this allowed them to connect on a spiritual level. But what I found most intriguing was the way the author wrote from both of their POVs. So you really got to see what it was like for both characters. Their prayers, their struggles, and their conversations with God.What does one do when they felt the Lord speaking to them so surely about something, such as a potential mate, but then all of a sudden you feel as if that's not the right path to take? You really need to spend time with the Lord, and keep going, which is exactly what these characters did. Maybe not the way we would have, but in their own way. I enjoyed their natural conversations with the Lord. It flowed out of them as if they were speaking to a friend. Something we could all learn from.Overall I thought this was a very sweet romance, and would recommend that all young adults read it, male and female. It would be a great book to share in a youth group setting as well. I received a complimentary copy of this book. I was not required to write a favorable review.

In fact, this first book is a bit different to most other contemporary romances too, because the hero and heroine don\u2019t meet until the end of the book! And yet, as odd as that might sound . . . it works. As well as being a sweet romance, it\u2019s the story of two people who are struggling to (a) understand why the path they believed God had for them has suddenly been blocked; and (b) accept this new direction in spite of their hearts.The book actually begins in the middle of Scott and Susannah\u2019s story. At the opening, it has been four months since the event that set Susannah\u2019s life on a new course\u2014away from Scott and her dream of overseas missions\u2014and the story looks both forwards and backwards from this point, showing Scott and Susannah trying to move on and surrender their hopes and dreams to God, but also filling in the story of how their relationship grew without them ever having met face to face and what happened to change everything. I thought this was a strange way to tell the story at first, but as it progressed, I became convinced it was also the most effective way to tell the story.The plot develops at a gentle pace that suits the characters and the tone of the story. There were a few times I felt the story was moving a little too gently in the early stages, but in way, that added to the experience. I was restless\u2014wanting things to move on, wanting answers\u2014in exactly the same way as Scott and Susannah, and their disappointment and confusion was palpable. I couldn\u2019t help but want to know the rest of their story.I\u2019m not going to say anything else about the plot, because I think it needs to unfold in its own way, but if you\u2019re looking for a sweet contemporary romance that\u2019s a little outside the normal mould, this is for you.I received a copy of this novel from the author.

I would probably label this more women\u2019s fiction with a romance thread than straight romance, though.When Susannah makes a decision to keep a promise, everything between her and Scott comes to a screeching halt. There\u2019s a touch of depression in Susannah that\u2019s not at all explored\u2014a missed opportunity I would have liked to see taken advantage of. Yet, Susannah\u2019s sacrifice is something I admired about here. She\u2019s young and a bit clueless, but not to the point of annoyance.Overall, a light read that brings home the point that God wants to give us the deepest desires of our heart even when we\u2019re afraid to ask Him for them.Disclosure statement:I receive complimentary books from publishers, publicists, and/or authors, including NetGalley.

The writing focuses on the heartache of two devoted Christians who fall in love but are kept apart due to life circumstances. The main characters\u2019 doubts, cries of grief and sorrow for love perceived to be lost, struggles to understand God\u2019s bigger plan, and striving for peace and contentment even when submerged in confusion are all so real and touchable.

I know when I was getting ready to graduate, I had plans to attend college and become a teacher. I had a boyfriend and figured we would just follow each other to college and see what happens. Sometimes what we want doesn\u2019t always happen the way we plan. This book is one that gives hope, reinforces how we need to continue to have faith and patience. I loved Susannah right away. She has such a big heart and wants to go into the mission field. God placed that desire on her heart and she was excited to follow her dream. I loved how she became friends with Scott . It was nice to read about how their relationship developed and their dream of mission work was shared between them. When a tragedy strikes, Susannah makes a heart-wrenching decision that will change everything in her life. The beauty of her selfless act choked me up. How many of us would give up everything to take care of a loved one?

I recommend reading \"What Dreams May Come\" by Alana Terry to everyone, even mature teens and preteens that are wanting and desiring a relationship. I would recommend to teens because even alot of Christian fiction for teens today have a hint of improper behavior described in the books. I also recommend having a few tissues handy because this book might cause a few tears.

She loves her sister but also wonders why God put the desire for missions in her heart if he was going to allow this to happen.I truly felt Susananah's heartbreak throughout the story. She often questioned God. But needless to say, God's plans are not always our plans. Sometimes even He goes a roundabout way to get His will done and teach us at the same time.

Young Susannah has a heart for God and for the mission field, willing to go wherever God calls her; however she also has a heart for her sister and has promises she made to her mother. Then, as my Dad used to say \"someone put a wrench in the works\", and Susannah is torn apart and her heart feels broken. While looking for a job which might lead her to the mission work she wants to do, she meets Scott through letters, email and telephone calls and she is sure he is the man that God has planned for her to marry. Should Susannah break her promise to her mother to look after her sister or should she answer the 'call of God' to meet Scott and prepare herself for the Mission she feels God is calling her to fulfill.This story will delight you, and keep you interested to the very end as you read and understand all the ways God works in our life to bring us to the place where He wants us to be. I was blessed to be able to read an ARC copy of this book, while waiting for the final book to be launched. I thoroughly enjoyed this story."}, {"userName": "Carol Keen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32537546-carol-keen", "userReview": "I hadn't read this author before, even though I'd seen some of Alana Terry's books here and there. This is a clean romance that was also an interesting read. It has plenty of realism and gentleness. It has the feeling of real life being altered to become a solid work of fiction. It can be a bit slow at times, but I still didn't want to put it down. I love books with more than one point of view, which this book has. I tend to like how that adds depth to the story. My only aggravation is that Susannah was depressed and it was touched on, and then it felt passed on over. I did like the premise. So often we do have goals, dreams, passions, things deeply rooted and dear to us, and it's often the case that everything seems to delay or fight to keep us from that very thing we seek to obtain. I had to have missed something because later I found out who's love story this is based on, and it made it all the richer for the reason. God is woven into the story in ways that are easy and real to me. My copy came from Celebrate Lit.

She always takes an issue and creates a plot around it. This time it is the issue of God giving one a dream, a passion, and then allowing circumstances to prevent that dream from coming into reality. While Terry does not give readers any neat theological answer, she does take us into the strong feelings of a Christian wondering what in the world God is doing. The fictional end leaves us hanging about the possibility of a missionary future. But we know the story is based on Terry's own life. Since she's a homeschooling mom and pastor's wife in Alaska, she must have come to grips with her missionary dream and the ensuing reality of life.I received a complimentary digital copy of this book through Celebrate Lit.

Susannah wants to be a missionary but life circumstances get the way. Love how she cares for her disabled sister and she ends up being her main caregiver. Her sister cannot care for herself at all and can only have formula even being grown. Susannah meets Scott through Email when checking into missionary work. Her and Scott fall in love through phone calls, mail and emails but will they ever get together. I love how the book was written, in current time for Susannah and the emails written to Scott in the past time. I kept wandering through out the book how it was going to end up, that is one thing I really loved about the book.

This was such a sweet story of two hearts connected, unseen, across miles. I liked how it was told almost like flashbacks in bits and pieces. Sometimes it felt a little too sweet and good, making it almost hard to connect with Susannah. But then when she\u2019s finally coming to terms with what she\u2019s sacrificed and how isolated and alone she feels, and yet keeps persevering in what she knows is right...the tears flowed. I look forward to the next story in the series!"}, {"userName": "Alicia Beck", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31450930-alicia-beck", "userReview": "My ReviewWhat Dreams May Come is a sweet romance with some sadness/heartache in it too. I have read books by this author before and this was another good read. This heavily is about being impatient when things do not work out the way we feel they would. Susanna and Scott are two of the main characters and those distance separated them they became quite close through calls , emails, and letters. When Susanna loses a member of her family she did not hesitate to take on a responsibility and closed a door in her life at that time. Kitty was probably my favorite character found in this story. I would describe this book as a light read.
