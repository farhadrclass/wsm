Even though I knew he wasn\u2019t really for Jay, I rooted for this guy! I was so sad to see the place Rhye was at five years down the line... Rhye made it big in the music industry. But his life is far from perfect. The guilt he carries, things he did that he felt were a catalyst in two friends deaths weighs him down. He turns to drugs, alcohol and women to help numb his life. \n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Rock star? Soon-to-be-washed-up-musician would be a more apt description. Recovering addict? Well, fuck. That went out the window last night. Murderer? Yeah, that holds true.\nRhye Clarke has one chance. Just one more chance from his record company to get clean, and come out with another great record. His record company sends him to Nashville to work on writing for the new album. He is to be paired up with a young, famous country star to do a duet. Rhye isn\u2019t thrilled at this, but he doesn\u2019t have much of a choice in the matter.Syn Landry is a sweet, innocent country girl. She is strong, independent, and knows exactly what she wants in life. Even though she is only nineteen, she seems older in some ways. Being from the same record company as Rhye, she is paired up with him for a duet. Syn is a fan of Rhye\u2019s. She\u2019s heard his albums, and knows how talented he is, but seeing him for the first time- hearing him, she is floored. \nI gape into Rhye Clark\u2019s dark abyss. An empty, soulless cavity. An uncontrollable full-body shiver shakes me to my core, and my world changes. Instantly. Irrevocably. \nSyn has a bit of insta-love towards Rhye, but with their connection, it isn\u2019t completely unbelievable. She sees the struggle he\u2019s facing and wants to be there for him. \nMy body naturally reacts to his, but it\u2019s my emotions that I don\u2019t understand. I want to protect him, shelter him, right every wrong; however, the most confusing aspect is not only do I want to fix him, but I want to fix myself. I want to be perfect for him, to be what he needs.\n The two of them have an interesting relationship to begin with. Rhye feels something different with Syn, but he doesn\u2019t want to. He doesn\u2019t want to know her. He knows someone like him would never deserve someone like her. The more time Rhye spends with Syn and feels her love, the more he starts to want her too. \nSyn absolutely brought out the very best in Rhye. She loved him and supported him no matter what, but did it in a way that she didn\u2019t enable him or let him walk all over her. For the first time in his life, Rhye has someone who genuinely cares, loves him for him and gives him a real reason to try to stay sober and move forward from the past. \n\u2018Don\u2019t give up easily and remember that anyone who is worth your love is worth waiting for.\u2019 \nRhye doesn\u2019t make it easy on Syn. It\u2019s difficult for him. To be sober. To stay sober. But he tries... and she is patient with him. \n\u2028I can\u2019t pass up a book about a rock star or a tortured soul, and the fact that this was about a character I already loved from a series... well you know I had to jump right in! I\u2019m so glad I did. I truly enjoy Nicole Reed\u2019s writing. The way it flows, the emotions she evokes, every book of hers makes me feel in some way or another. The only big issue I have with this book is I felt it ended abruptly. I truly felt for Rhye and Syn, and I really hope to get more from these two in a future book or novella!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9916227-jennifer-kyle", "userReview": "3.75 I'll Save You Stars\n\u201dCan he even have a heart?Is it even possible?His tiny, shriveled, and withered heart.Isn\u2019t that what it is?

He was the perfectly imperfect bad boy. And though my heart wanted him to get his HEA with Jay, my head knew it wasn't meant to be. So, when I found out he was getting his own book, I was over the moon happy! If anybody deserved to find some happiness (besides Jay, of course) it was Rhye. There was just one little thing I didn't think about in that moment of joy.That Rhye's story would be so damn heartbreaking.To get to any happy ending for someone so lost, it is going to be hard. Rhye is fighting against some serious demons that he chooses to bury under a haze of drugs and sex. It has cost him everything, even his love for music. I believe he thought he would never connect with it again and that only propelled the drug usage and sex binges even more. His mentality was \"what's the point of being sober when you have nothing left and no one gives a damn?\".\"We all have a weakness. Something that unleashes our eternal demons to gnaw away at our morality until it is picked clean from the bone. Sometimes, it leaves us with nothing. Numb from all emotion. Blind from what is right in front of you. What happens then? What's left?\"Syn comes into his live when he needs someone the most, but would never admit it. She is the innocent to his bad, the pure to his dirty. If there ever was a couple that were worlds apart, it would Rhye and Syn. But that is the very thing that made them perfect for one another. She sees something in him that he no longer can see in himself. She believes enough for the both of them that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, even if there will be moments of darkness getting there.\"Syn doesn't offer me empty words, broken promises, or careless caresses. It's something I've never known: giving without getting back a single damn thing. I don't understand it, and I'm afraid I never will.\"I loved that the darker side of Rhye's drug use was not glossed over. It was very much a real part of who he is and deserved to be present in his story. There is no magical fix and there are good days as well as bad. As someone who has seen the daily struggles addiction can bring to a loved one's life, I felt Nicole did a great job of making you really understand how tough it can be. I also commend her for how she ended things. As much I love my fairy tale endings, it is nice to have them be realistic sometimes too.Wasted Heart holds true to the angst type storyline from both Ruining Me and Ruining You. It may not be as heart wrenching, but it is still tough, especially if you already love Rhye. And even though it is part of the Ruining Series, it could be read as a stand-alone, although I would say it would be easier to understand Rhye's struggles if you read the other two books. It is mild on the steam, but for me at least, that was fine because that is the way the story was meant to be told. Overall, just an amazing read from start to finish!"}, {"userName": "Melissa ***BITCH, I'M READING!***", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12692033-melissa-bitch-i-m-reading", "userReview": "omg I made it through a \"Ruining\" book without crying my face off! go me!!I love this series, and these characters, I was excited to read this and happy that I got some answers to some questions I had from the last books.love this authors writing style and can't wait to read more from her!"}, {"userName": "Kirsty", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10389044-kirsty", "userReview": "\"She fell in love with a broken boy.\"\n\nNicole Reed blows me away with her writing again and again and Wasted Hear was absolutely no exception to that. I don't really know how she does it, but every book I read by her is always better than the last. We are all familiar with Rhye Clark from Nicole's Ruining Series and whilst I did always love him in that book, I was never on Team Rhye.. it was always Kane for me. Having said that, I did love his character and as soon as I heard that Nicole was writing another book all about Rhye I couldn't have been more disappointed. He's the type of guy we all love, even when we shouldn't. The rock star, the bad boy, the one in to all the wrong things.. drugs, drink and women. But the biggest shocker of all? Rhye has a heart of gold.\n\n\"Who wants to live this life sober when the alternative makes you feel abso-fucking-lutely nothing?\"\n\nRhye is skating on thin ice. His record label have just about had enough of him, and they give him one last chance to get his crap together and sort his life out. Easier said than done for a guy so buried deep in grief and heartache that he can't find a way out. He agrees to stay in Nashville, recording a new album and staying on the straight and narrow.. meaning 11pm curfew's, regular drug tests and creating a duet with one of the countries leading country singers, Syn Landry.I LOVED Syn's character. She may only be 19, but she too has lived a life full of grief and heartbreak, only she came out the other side a stronger person. She pours her whole heart and soul in to her music and is always so ready and willing to help out someone in need.. Rhye included. For someone treated so like crap (from Rhye) she never gave up on him. She knew what she wanted.. him.. and she went for it, even during the times when I'm sure anyone else would have told him exactly where to go. She quickly became one of my favourite heroines to read about.\n\n\"I gape into Rhye Clark's dark abyss. An empty, soulless cavity. An uncontrollable full-body shiver shakes me to my core, and my world changes. Instantly. Irrevocably.\"\n\nNot only did I love these characters alone, but I loved them together. They brought out the best qualities in each other, and they showed time and time again that they were so good for each other. Nicole has created characters here who, could not be more different, but at the same time be so perfect for each other. \n\"We are not only polar opposites, we are from different worlds entirely.\"\n Syn is the light, whilst Rhye is the dark. Syn is the happy, whilst Rhye is the deeply sad. Rhye is the addict, Syn is the girl who doesn't drink, let alone touch a drug. They really couldn't be any more different but that just makes them work. They complimented each other in the best of ways.\n\n\"His voice. God that voice. The deep, raspy tone gives me chill bumps just thinking about it. It reaches down inside and tugs at every string you possess.\"\n\nI've already briefly mentioned Nicole's writing, but I can't do this book justice without properly going in to detail about it. I don't know how she manages it, but every book she churns out is just better and better and it is so damn obvious that she works so hard to improve every time. Whether it be this series, or Cake, Nicole brings out all the emotions and has you feeling everything. Wasted Heart is told in both Syn and Rhye's POV, and obviously I must be a real Rhye fan, because his chapters were my favourite. Witnessing first hand his struggles when it came to his drug addiction were so realistic. It was so plain to me that Nicole knew what she was talking about here and I appreciated that so much when reading his chapters. The times he would beat himself up over feeling inadequate and not worthy of life, let alone love, were so painfully beautiful. \n\n\"I suffer greatly for my sins. I've never needed a judge or jury because I crucify myself just fine.\"\n\nI could easily have highlighted and quoted the whole freaking book but something tells me Nicole would have been less impressed so I tried hard to refrain. That just shows me that this book was all kinds of incredible. And I think for anybody who is a fan of The Ruining Series then there is no way you won't love this. Whether you were Team Kane, JT or Rhye, Nicole brings you the same level of emotion and angst here, as well as an imperfect HAE. My favourite kind.\n\n\u266b \"And I don't know how you revived this ceaseless beating.And made it restart.I want you to stay, inside this once wasted heart.\" \u266b\n\n*ARC provided by Nicole Reed in turn for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "LZ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3702516-lz", "userReview": "***5 BEAUTIFULLY TORTURED STARS***Nicole Reed truly delivers in this story!!! IMO, her writing gets better with every book and this one is no different. Wasted Heart shows maturity in the writing and is filled with so many well written phrases. For anyone that is a fan of her Ruining Series, this is a MUST READ!!!We met Rhye Clark in Runing Me but, a lot has happened since then. The Rhye in Wasted Heart is a jaded and tortured man.

And, while Nicole Reed has showed us that she could do angst like no other, this isn't all angst. It couldn't be, not with a MC like Syn. I must admit that I was unsure about Syn for the first 20% of the book. She was soooooo wholesome and navite.She's the epitome of the lovable dorky girl\u2026 so endearingly silly and sweet that I couldn't resist her. By the end of the story, I not only liked Syn, I wanted to beat Rhye FOR her. I realized that she needed to be the light to Rhye's dark in order to be strong enough for him\u2026FOR THEM. Rhye does not make it easy to love him, he's cruel, resisting and hard but, Syn can't help it, even at a cost to herself.And believes it she does. Syn's love for Rhye had me frustrated more times than I could count. I honestly believe most people would of been out the door in the first five minutes. I kept thinking \"Oh hell no! Get out of there! Why put up with this?\" He put her through so much crap that I think her sweetness was the only way she could endure it.\"There were good times, stolen moments when my world opened up to the possibilities of becoming a woman.

Admittedly, I love the bad-boy rock star. Who doesn\u2019t? When Nicole Reed said she was writing Rhye\u2019s story (you all certainly remember him from her Ruining Series), you can only imagine how excited I was.We pick up four years after Rhye is discovered at the music showcase, and Rhye, well, he\u2019s different. My heart seriously breaks for him as we become acquainted with what has gone on in his life these past four years. Yes, he\u2019s made it big, but at what price? He seems lost, broken, worn-out, a shell of what he once was. His record label is ready to drop him, and they are giving him one opportunity to make this right, to get his act together. Rhye doesn\u2019t take the deal from the label for himself because he is past caring what happens to him; he does it for someone else, and I am quickly reminded of what a huge heart Rhye has and why I loved him as much as I did in the Ruining Series.\n\n\u201cThe music doesn\u2019t run through my veins like it used to. It doesn\u2019t lead me. It doesn\u2019t sing through my blood and bleed out through my lyrics. It doesn\u2019t make me feel anything anymore.\u201d\n\nEnter Syd. Our female lead here has her own difficult, grief-filled past, and she uses her music as a means of almost therapy. She writes songs and plays music to help her release that agony she felt in her younger years. Syd is my kind of heroine, strong, fiercely loyal, and not afraid to tell you what is on her mind. When she does anything, she doesn\u2019t do it halfway; she loves wholly, and this includes her relationship with Rhye. As many times as I wanted to slap some sense into him, Syd understands him; she gets him. Syd is so invested in him, and it is probably the first time in his life that Rhye has had someone so passionate about him.\n\n\u201cSometimes we meet people and have this instant connection. I\u2019m sure, in some cases, it can turn into love, but that\u2019s after getting to know someone so intimately that you\u2019re willing to take on their internal struggles as your own.\u201d\n\nWhat follows is a fantastic story about a love, loss, addiction, helplessness, and hope. Unfortunately, Rhye is a tortured soul, and there are many instances where it seems like he is fighting a losing battle to survive. He\u2019s struggling to find himself, to stay above water, to be a man worthy of someone\u2019s love and compassion, not knowing if he can truly be what Syd needs. Rhye fights to see the good in himself; he\u2019s lost his ability to love and to care, and he truly is \"hollow, empty, wasted,\" but does that mean he always will be? Rhye has tough choices to make here, and the journey along the road of recovery is certainly never easy. It is something he will struggle with for a lifetime.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lost trying to find my way. Inside your wasted heart.\u201d\n\nI won\u2019t tell you much more about this one; it needs to be experienced. As always, Ms. Reed has her characters dealing with real-life situations in real-life ways. There are no quick fixes; there is no magic wand to bring these characters their respective HEA\u2019s. Once again, Ms. Reed has improved upon her writing, and I feel privileged to be able to bear witness to it."}, {"userName": "Ailene\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19370866-ailene", "userReview": "A damaged rock star that was given by his record label one last chance... A wholesome country singer at the top of her career... The two met for a collaboration. I had high hopes for this one because I did like the progression at first. It was told in dual POV and the characters were introduced well. I could say that I got connected with them individually. But the moment they met, there's just no chemistry at all. There were very few interactions. It focused mainly on the making of music, what to write, what's next, people to deal with and all the technicalities. I kept on saying there might be more to come. But there's none... Nothing happened. I was curious regarding the hero's past and what lead him to what he was. I thought there would be some climactic scenes or something like that. But all that happened was instant resolution. The author focused on \u201cwhat she thinks, what he thinks\u201d only to realize that they were suddenly hooking up. There was never a build up. I also have to mention the heroine. Her virginity/innocence was written in a way that it was too damn special. She seemed too proud of it. I could even feel that she's been itching to tell it to him. I thought there was more to her. But I found her shallow and overdramatic. To be honest, there came a time that I really hated her pov. And what\u2019s up with her ex? The ex was also a famous musician who had a problem moving on and kept writing songs about her. Of course, any reader would think there would be conflicts about that. But nothing came up. So, what the heck were those very long flashbacks for?Then, along came the hero who was a manwhore (again)... and an addict. He even hooked up with 3 girls. There might be a resolution about his past at the end of the story. But there was NO character development. I couldn\u2019t really see him capable of handling a long-term relationship. And why do they always have to be a manwhore? It doesn't even represent reality because I believe that most men aren't like that. Most men still look for a deeply nourishing relationship with women, right?I think this story had its potential. But maybe due to pressure with deadlines, the author decided to rush it. I just realized that it\u2019s nearing its end and saying to myself \"Hey! But they just met!\"... Yes, it definitely felt that way and to think that this book is a normal length novel.I'd like to rate it with 2 stars since I have no problem with the writing style. But the hero getting a blow job from another woman, then, having a threesome some other night was a BIG deal breaker for me. Yes, technically he wasn't cheating. But whatever, the reader felt cheated nonetheless..."}, {"userName": "Chris- Bookaddict", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4949749-chris--bookaddict", "userReview": "Full review now Posted Absolutely Rock Star Awesome. Nicole Wrote Rhye's Story beautifully... \nRhye... we first met him in The Ruining Series. I loved him in that series. I am so happy that Nicole gave him his own book!!!!! I would suggest to FULLY understand this book read the first two in the Ruining series first. That way you can completely understand Rhye and why he is the way he is. Anyone that know Nicole know that she LOVES angst, she thrives on it!!! She brings it out in her books amazingly with every word.She writes so amazingly that she has you feeling every emotion with her characters. We all love a bad-boy rock star and with Rhye we get that and so much more. \u201cWho are you?\u201dThe image in the mirror staring back at me feigns disinterest. Rock star? Recovering addict? Murderer? \u201dEveryone I\u2019ve ever cared about turned away, chose someone or something else.\u201d Rhye, we pick up with him 4 yrs after he is a discovered Rock Star. He made it big, but now 4 years later he feels like a wasted space person, he is lost, a tortured soul broken, and he does not feel anything anymore. He does have a heart but he does not feel he has a right to use it or to show anyone his feelings. He has one chance left with his record company to bring himself out of the whole he is in and make something of his group. If he fails they will drop him at the record label. \u201cThe music doesn\u2019t run through my veins like it used to. It doesn\u2019t lead me. It doesn\u2019t sing through my blood and bleed out through my lyrics. It doesn\u2019t make me feel anything anymore.\u201dWatching Rhye in the beginning and seeing the struggles he was going through with himself broke my heart. When he decided to take the deal from the record label for someone else and not for himself it reminded me once again how much I loved Rhye and his BIG heart. Syd, I LOVED her. She uses her music as her own therapy. She has a grief filled past. She pours her heart and soul into her lyrics and music. She gets her big break with a record label where she has to record a duet with Rhye in Nashville. Rhye who in the beginning does not care about anyone or anything. We soon see what these two mean to each other. We see first hand how one person can help a person bring themselves out of the hole they are in. Syd loves with everything she has, she is passionate, she is caring 100% and she does everything in her power to help Rhye. In the process she falls in love with him completely. Will Syd change Rhye? Will she be able to get him to open up and realize that his heart is not wasted after all? Some of my other favorite quotes from the book :\"I suffer greatly for my sins. I've never needed a judge or jury because I crucify myself just fine.\"\"His voice. God that voice. The deep, raspy tone gives me chill bumps just thinking about it. It reaches down inside and tugs at every string you possess.\"\u201cIf I take you, I can\u2019t say what you need to hear. Not because I wouldn\u2019t mean it, but because I don\u2019t know what it really means. Something is so fucking wrong inside of me that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to be fixed. Even at this moment, if it was a choice between a hit of smack or you, I wish I could tell you, without another thought, that it would be you, but I can\u2019t,\u201d\u201cAfter spending today with you, I know you could live here forever and be content, but even now, I\u2019m becoming jittery, needing more than the silence and the peace. I can\u2019t fix me for you anymore than you could dirty yourself up enough for me. I don\u2019t want to sleep with you and tell you thanks for the fuck and walk away. I know that it would shatter something inside me that really would be unfixable.\u201d Love.A four letter word. So beautiful in its spelling. So simple in its arrangement. So innocent in its meaning.

Firstly I would love to thank my gorgeous friend and author Nicole for providing me a copy of this amazing book. It couldn't have come at a better time. I loved Rhye in the other books I mean hallo rock god tattoos what's not to love, but this one was all about him and damm do you get inside his head, he is heartbroken and tortured and really he feels like he doesn't deserve to be here he is a beautiful tortured soul. In comes innocent and beautiful Syn ( loved her name) the total opposite of Rhye she doesn't drink, smoke or do drugs and to top it off she is a country singer, couldn't be anymore different . But as soon as Syn lays her eyes on Rhye she sees something that no one else does and things begin from there, let me say Rhye is very messed up and needs someone not to give up on him to fight for him no matter how many times he stuffs up! can Syn be that person or is she just waiting for her heart to be torn in pieces you have to read it to find out as it's not an easy road. Once again Nicole has written another must read and trust me if you have read ruining me and ruining you, you NEED to read this one. I recommend this book for everyone !!!!"}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11651018-paula", "userReview": "Rhye was my favorite from the Ruining Me series so I was really looking forward to this. I was a little surprised to see where life had led Rhye since we last saw him. Tortured hero is a slight understatement and he definitely has good reason. Sometimes a bad boy needs a sweet, genuinely nice girl and that's what we get with Syn. She sees something in Rhye and refuses to give up. She falls hard very quickly but it works in this story because Rhye definitely needs it. One thing I've noticed with each of Nicole Reed's books is the details of the story get better and better. She did an amazing job making me experience what Rhye was going through. I hate that Rhye has all these things working against him but Syn is the perfect character to help him through it. Certain issues in books, in my opinion, can't be sugar coated and magically made to go away. You can show it may never be easy but it's never hopeless and that's what Nicole Reed did."}, {"userName": "Daisy ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10291309-daisy", "userReview": "Rhye <3 What a struggle with his addiction, his disease.

However, I didn't really connect with this book like I was hoping. We come to find Rhye around 4-years after he walks away from Jay since she had chosen someone else...she always chooses someone else over Rhye. Now we have a broken down, shell of his former self Rhye, who I really do not care for when we encounter him. He is a junkie, and I find that very unappealing. He is being given one last chance by his label to record some more kick ass music, or all ties will be cut. We meet Syn, a bleeding heart, innocent and young country star on the rise. I must admit I liked Syn right away. Despite her virginal innocence, she was a very loyal and down to earth character. While she is rising to the top, her label wants her to have a pop crossover type sound for her next album and ends up being paired with Rhye.Okay, I was ok with all of this, but wondering if Ms Reed was really going to put Rhye and Syn together as a couple, immediately thinking it simply won't work. Well, that's what tried to unfold in front of my eyes, but I just could not buy it. I mean, Syn basically falls in love with Rhye as soon as she sees him. She has these strong feelings for him immediately, which made zero sense. I could believe that Syn could relate to Rhye when she saw glimpses of his passion for music emerge, but for that to translate into deep seated feelings for Rhye and fall for him before they have barely talked?! Um...nope, didnt work for me. Just so much of their relationship made no sense whatsoever. It just was because the author said so, there was very little building of it, then what we did see was rather late in the story. This is another book where a relationship is so because the author writes it on the paper, but we just don't feel it or see it evolve.Then, toward the end I felt we were not given a complete story, not even being left with a HFN, in my opinion. I guess that is to be expected when Syn chose to be with a junkie. I couldn't help feeling she deserved better and I will never understand choosing that type of person. I realize you cannot help who you love, but choosing to be disappointed over and over again seems like a horrible way to live.As is apparent in my review, I am not a huge fan of excessive drug use or of love stories that follow recovering addicts because the statistics are not in the addicts favor. It makes me sad for the loved ones in the path of the addict and I guess that's why I didn't enjoy this book. Especially when you put someone like Syn in the mix since I liked her too much to want her to bear that burden of loving an addict who will eventually choose his demons over her, and probably multiple times. I thought the author was true to the statistics about addicts and didn't sugarcoat things, but it doesn't mean the story we are left with was something I enjoyed. Sorry."}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23354202-nikki", "userReview": "ARC Was Given To Blog For An Honest ReviewA runaway train. That is the only way for me to describe this story. This is a spinoff about the extremely broken character of Rhye that we met in Ruining You and Ruining Me. Rhye knows how to love. We saw how he loved Jay in the other books and how he gave up fighting for her so that she could be happy. He is packed with a ton of emotional baggage because of the past and because of recent events in the present. He is the quintessential bad boy rock star! SEX, DRUGS, ROCK AND ROLL.I will put emphasis on the drugs. Now that you know or remember hell, let me introduce you to heaven. Her name is Syn, sweet wholesome virginal country star. I think you all get it now. She is all that but a bit Alpha female and I like it on her. Opposites attract, the angel trying to save the soul of the sinner. Syn immediately falls for Rhye when she meets him.I really wanted to love this story, but I am not sure if I can say I liked it or not. I am in a mindset that the author may have wanted it that way. Not all stories can be hearts and flowers and magically everything is ok in life because you fall in love and love heals everyone. I give kudos to the author for taking the story in the direction that she did. Nicole Reed wrote this story with some realistic truths. On the other hand I felt parts were not real at all. Drug addicts thrive on people believing them and manipulating their loved ones. In turn, family and friends become enablers and that is not what will help the addict. Syn believes that she should fight for their love and stick by him no matter what. Heroin addicts don\u2019t just go cold turkey and get clean on their own. Rhye falls off the wagon a few times; Syn leaves him, but comes back again.I have to say, I did not connect with these characters in any possible way, and I just did not find her love for him believable. On the other hand, Rhye\u2019s character I felt was real; I just did not fall in love with him. I felt bad for him at times; it was impossible not to feel bad for him. I did not get the closure on Rhye\u2019s demons that he was trying to purge even though the story tried to do it.Now did this review confuse you, did it feel contradictory? You are probably shaking your head yes right now. Well that is how I felt by the time I finished."}, {"userName": "MJ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14576940-mj", "userReview": "I truly loved Wasted Heart.This story of a broken soul who thinks he can't be saved and the country singing spitfire who vows to prove him wrong was just wonderful.This spinoff of the Ruining Me/Ruining You books features Rhye Clark, gorgeous rockstar who is on the borderline of being thrown off is label unless he cleans up his act and makes some music.Syn Landry is the country star who is the one he is supposed to make the music with. But the music making isn't just confined to the studio. Sparks fly between these two and it will be up to Syn to see if she can get through to the moody man.Rhye was featured as a \"boyfriend\" and supplier of drugs and alcohol to Jay Stevenson, the troubled heroine of the Ruining series. Jay broke his heart and several tragedies finally broke Rhye. In those two books, I was rooting for Kane David to be Jay savior. I mean, c'mon we're talking about Kane here!But with Wasted Heart, Nicole Reed gives up the story behind all of Rhye's demons and the difficult yet beautifully painful love affair between he and Syn.It is a story of hope, redemption, forgiveness and true friendship. Getting an \"update\" on Jay, Kane, Cal and Molly really made me smile. You couldn't help feel the healing that had started just by Rhye's visit to his former love.I loved that music played such a big part of their story as well. The songs we get to witness are just great.I highly recommend this book.

Their relationship ( if you can call it that) went from 0 to 60. Rhye is your typical drug addicted angry rocker with a dead wish. Syn is the all American virginal country singer. In their first meeting he is nothing but obnoxious and crude and she falls head over effing heals in love, yes I said IN LOVE! Never mind that she doesn't know him from a hole in the wall, or that she recently had her heart broken by someone she thought she loved. Apparently he was the one. She then painfully and forcefully goes out of her way to include herself in his life. Sad part was the sad desperation there..for no reason. He never gives her any. In fact he is pretty much an absolute ass hole throughout the whole book. I admit it, the cover was hot to me. I mean the pretty boy w/ tattoos was kitty nip. And all the good ratings? I have absolutely no clue how or why all these gals were swooning over this one. Hey I like my bad boys just as much as the next gal but he just had no finesse. And to top it off there was no progression to their so called luv affair.

She sees something in Rhye very few people care to see or acknowledge. She refuses to sit back and watch him destroy his life and his career. Rhye has to face his past if he has any chance at a future and a person he refuses to see, Jay. Syn is trying to help Rhye face his demons but she has to be strong or he will take her down with him. I absolutely loved how Jay and Kane was brought back into the story and we got a glimpse of their life. All of the characters in this book are great.

Let me start out by saying that I loved the book. I usually am drawn more to the male lead than the female. Usually the female lead makes me so mad. This book was a total turn around from that. I didn't really care for Rhye in the Ruining Me series. I felt that he enabled Jay so much. I also have to admit that during most of this book, I still didn't like Rhye. Thanks to Nicole Reed's writing I understood him and his actions much better. (Doesn't mean that I agree with his choices.) I also understood what made him tick. But, still he isn't may favorite character. On the other hand Syn is a wonderful character for me. She loves Rhye no matter what crap he gives her. She never once left his side even when he deserved it. Rhye needs someone like Syn. She goes all in. I can imagine that the lifestyle that rockers live would be a hard lifestyle for the ones who love them. This book was edgy, raw, and angst filled. I felt a bit cheated at the end.

I am sooooooooo glad this book was about him because I loved his character and the way Jay did him in the first 2 books left a bad taste in my mouth. So needless to say I was comforted in knowing someone will love him with all she had.....Syn! (Best heroine name ever) and she's a country girl. Two thumbs up to her love and determination. Throughout the book, the author had me continually consigning on her decision to use someone so pure to immerse Rhye with the love he needed to fill his wasted heart.

I loved Rhye in the series. A troubled, young, tattooed, sexy HOT mess. He may have done some messed up thing's to Jay initially in the series but there was one constant...his love for her. Now here we are a few years later after we know Jay didn't pick him. He really went down hill. Trying to clean up his act, he goes to Nashville and meets Syn. She was a fun, strong, honest character. She is just coming off of a breakup herself with a man she thought she loved. Until she is in the same room with Rhye. But in some parts she seemed a little stalker-ish you could say. She had feelings for him and he could have cared less. However Syn was persistent. A little disappointing though that he doesn't come to terms with his feelings until almost the end and even then it's a little shady. Typical Rhye fashion though.

I loved that Reed didn;t have Rhye magically \"cured\" of his addiction is was/is something he is going to struggle with his whole fictional life, and having it told that way adds a realness to the story that I sometimes found lacking in others.
