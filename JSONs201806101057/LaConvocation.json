Life, of course, has to develop and move on; I lost the man (our lives were taking different directions), Sylvie died in quarantine but my magnificent book was and still remains with me: the \u201cAlexandria Quartet\u201d by Lawrence Durrell. I\u2019ve tried many times to write an account on why this book has had, and still continues to have, such a dramatic effect on me and I\u2019ve always failed. That is a twentieth century masterpiece. I\u2019ve now come across the same problem with \u201cThe Appointment\u201d. I have so much to say but I\u2019m having distinct difficulties in trying to achieve this. I also wish to succeed because I want everyone possible to become aware of this book and read it.But I digress and so back to Herta M\u00fcller. This is such an incredible woman and I really don\u2019t know where to start which rather confuses me. I\u2019ve certainly never been lost for words before and in fact I\u2019ve been criticized for being too verbose but then that\u2019s my personality and I\u2019m certainly not going to change now.What really did surprise me is that I stumbled across a writing style that I\u2019m only recently beginning to appreciate, the  stream of consciousness monologue that James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Marcel Proust were early exponents of.The story is actually rather banal and there\u2019s not a plot as such as it is set on a single tram ride to our narrator\u2019s increasing appointments, actually interrogations with Major Albu. She had made a simple mistake of wanting to escape from Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s totalitarian regime in communist Romania. Our unnamed narrator\u2019s crime (a seamstress working in a clothing factory) had been:Putting handwritten notes in the back pockets of ten white linen suits being shipped to Italy that said, \"Marry me\" and signed with her name and address.Various other notes had been planted which our narrator denied but Major Albu was determined to extract the truth from her come what may.I cannot even begin to imagine what it must be like living under such conditions and in a way I can see why Ms M\u00fcller decided to leave the narrator unnamed. Indirectly and in a contradictory way she is divorcing herself from the situation by living in anonymity.Although the tram ride takes ninety minutes, her various observations and the internal monologue they spark cover the breadth of her life. We learn about her past, her friends (Lilli in particular) and family, daily life and Romanian \"expropriation\" and other government officials, to name a few. All this appears in the landscape of her thoughts and memories. Although her stream of consciousness takes us to various places in time and space, there is a fairly diffuse sense of ennui and antipathy.This book is so powerfully written. It is a veritable tour de force. It can be depressing at times, but then bounces back with black humour and comedy; interwoven with beautiful descriptions. Betrayal and lies are also imbedded within the text but it was the attention to detail which particularly impressed me; for example, the two wicker baskets to be found outside the bus her father drives. Our narrator had realized that she has left her bag there and goes to look for it. My eyes widened and I laughed at this mesmerizing description.I kept on rereading pages and thought how did the author manage such exquisite prose when she lived under a totalitarian regime?Colours such as red and black are other powerful motifs symbolising death and showing how little life was valued in Romania at the time. Under their muzzles Lilli lay red as a bed of poppies.And,Our nameless narrator fumbled in her bag and found a small package there. It was \u201ca finger with a bluish-black nail.Her second husband Paul\u2019s red Java motorbike. It was such a shame that he was a drunkard but he did give our narrator happiness for the first couple of years.Amusing incidents stud the book, for example with melons but the part that really enthralled me was the New Year\u2019s Eve paraputch (extended family according to her father-in-law) when our narrator recalls the celebration in her father-in-law\u2019s house (by her first marriage). \u201dI\u2019ll never know exactly what paraputch means. For me it sounds like a gang, because the family was so large and each member was shady in his own way.\u201dBut when the celebrations get underway, it\u2019s sheer bedlam and I revelled in it, especially Anastasia and the lascivious widower and gardener Martin who fancied his chances with the guests!The incident that had me on tenterhooks was when our narrator cannot get off the tram at the bus station, because of an incident and because she knows that she\u2019s going to be late for her \u201cappointment\u201d. When she finally gets off at the next stop she starts running and finds herself in a road where\u2026.. I had to reread this section not only one but three times. There were various interpretations here, well for me anyway, and the jury is still out on this.Another odd thing though was that there were no quotation marks or question marks throughout the book. I wonder why our author did that.I was also taken with the fact that Paul and our narrator lived in a \u201cleaning tower\u201d. This is a very powerful, dark and moving novel. I can only describe it as depressing-brilliance and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Ms M\u00fcller justifiably deserves being a Nobel laureate. Bravo, and bravo\u2026"}, {"userName": "William1", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william1", "userReview": "The Appointment is about life in Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu\u2019s communist Romania. What a simultaneously sinister and banal place. The mind won\u2019t absorb it. The novel is in every sense a dystopia. Only in this case it happens not to be an SF fantasy but based on 20th century events. Seemingly without effort, Herta M\u00fcller shows us the utter self-defeating nature of police states, their inefficiency, rotten core, bankrupt ideology, and doomed future.Its narrative line is elliptical. It has been written in a rich though understated style with a subtle patterning of motifs throughout. It is \u201cstory\u201d distilled to its essentials. I suppose it might be called muscular were its anatomy not so delicately wrought. It is not chic lit. It is highly readable literary fiction, not at all cryptic, and in the end emotionally shattering. The Appointment has a fragmented narrative line. It consists of an interbraiding, if you will, of nine or ten related stories. It is not a collection of linked stories. Not at all. It is a novel. First there is the core story of our unnamed female narrator as she takes one particular streetcar journey to an interrogation with Major Albu, her tormentor in the secret police. Both city and narrator are unnamed, as are the state\u2019s leader and its form of government. One senses M\u00fcller wants nothing to do with politics. Around this core of the streetcar trip other stories are intertwined. These include the life and death of the beautiful Lilli and her elderly lover; the story of our narrator's involvement with a co-worker, Nelu, whom she fucks out of sheer boredom during a grim business trip and will thereafter have nothing to do with; and the story of how she meets Paul, her second husband.Early on she does something very silly, something that would be laughable in any other context, but which the authorities consider treasonous. She writes her name and address on slips of paper along with an offer of marriage and inserts these \"letters in a bottle\" into the pockets of garments she knows will be shipped to men\u2019s stores in Italy. Needless to say, the slips are found before shipping and she is denounced by the rejected Nelu. Henceforth, she must endure periodic interrogations by the creepy Major Albu at state security, who intentionally slobbers all over her hand when \u201ckissing\u201d it. This is the perfect metaphor for Power\u2019s attitude to long tradition, especially civility to women. Albu is scary but over the course of the novel we come to see how impotent he is. Moreover, we come to know what the state fears: its dissolution by unknown means. A fate it was to undergo when the democratic movement swept Eastern Europe in 1989. (One of the highlights of that period, in my view, is the videotaped execution of the old tyrant Ceau\u015fescu and his termagant wife for crimes against the people. (See YouTube for video.) The state\u2019s involvement in the minutiae of its citizens\u2019s lives never fails to astound the reader. But why? It seems to me it would be like sending your innocuous kid sister in for questioning. Why do it? Of what possible intelligence value can there be in interrogating a young woman who works in a button factory? It is done solely in the name of ideological conformity. The people of this unnamed state have nothing to be proud of. They are essentially prisoners in their own country. Lilli is shot while trying to cross the border. Her fate becomes hortatory propaganda. There is no cultural life to speak of, no artistic expression. Romania under Ceau\u015fescu makes Orwell\u2019s 1984 look like a fun day spent at Six Flags Great Adventure.Very striking is the consistent preference throughout of young women for old men. Young men are \u2014 no, not those on whom all hopes and dreams for the future are placed \u2014 but a thoroughly disenfranchised lot, without opportunity, almost invisible. Paul is the group\u2019s lone representative for the duration of the book, except for one scene set in an Officers Club. Here the emasculated young men sit at tables ogling Lilli and her old man and tossing matchheads at them. Right or wrong, I saw the matchheads as symbols of forestalled ignition, quashed passion.The narrator\u2019s Inexplicable first marriage is to the son of the Perfumed Commissar, once head of state expropriation, who not only took every scrap of property her grandparents owned, but then sent them to a hellish \u201ccamp,\u201d a gulag essentially, where the grandmother promptly died, reduced to geophagy.This is a very powerful, very dark novel. I recommended it highly. However, if you are new to Herta M\u00fcller's work I would advise you to start with the even more remarkable  In the Land of Green Plums."}, {"userName": "Jim Fonseca", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca", "userReview": "The heroine of this novel lives her life waiting. She is a seamstress in a Romanian factory making fine men's overcoats for export to Italy. She is so desperate for escape from her pointless life that she inserts notes saying \"Marry Me,\" with her name and address, into the linings of the coats. She has a live-in male friend who spends all of his time and most of her money drinking the day away. There is no future here - it's more like maintaining a big dog and having the expense that goes with it.This is Eastern Europe before the fall of the Berlin Wall. So our heroine is in trouble again for those notes. It's happened before. Now she could lose her job or even be imprisoned. She's been summoned once more to the inspector's office - thus the book's title. The inspector is now taking a personal interest in her case; that is, he is taking a personal interest in her. Like other novels of Eastern Europe under Communism, the work is filled with angst and anomie. Waiting. Waiting for something.We are treated to some great prose. \"I developed a yearning for being alone, unkempt, untended--later, this disappeared and then showed up again in my mother.\" \"The tap water tasted of chlorine, and the chlorine tasted of the sleep I wasn't getting.\" \"His face froze up. Then his eyeballs glistened and turned into little squares. Out shot his arm, and he slapped me. He was better at that then he was at making coffee, tying shoelaces, or sharpening pencils.\" Herta Muller won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2009."}, {"userName": "Deea", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8111258-deea", "userReview": "There is a shocking matter of factness in the voice addressing to the readers of this book. Belonging to the female character in the center of the story, it weaves the narration by adding together episodes full of horror from a past under communism (her grandmother's death, her father's adultery, her father-in-law's acts of violence, Lilli's sexual misbehavior and death), details regarding a present ride by tram to the police office for interrogations and random descriptions of objects.How is it to feel that everything surrounding you is spying on you? Innanimate objects get personified around and these, together with people surrounding you (among whom most act crazy if they are not crazy already) seem to take part in a conspiratory whirlpool which has in the center your life. Everything becomes part of this cycle and the repetition and dullness of everyday events scare the hell out of you. Everything seems to be an enemy, everyone and everything seem to be plotting against you, even the lifeless objects in their silence seem to whisper against you. Everything suggests the feeling that someone is watching you and is going to inform on you to the secret police under the Romanian communist regime led by Ceausescu. Stricken with constant fear and with the feeling that senselessness is easier to handle than the aimlessness of the everyday events, the main character constantly gives an answer to the question pointed above which Herta Muller seems to make a whole theme out of in this book (\"How is it to feel that everything surrounding you is spying on you?\"). The sessions of interrogations and her fear of being summoned become the major events of her present summing up a centerfold around which her whole life revolves.In such an atmosphere, it becomes impossible to grasp who you are anymore and what your principles really are: \"it's easy to talk about bad years if they are past. But when you have to say right who you are at this very moment, it's hard to get more out than an uneasy silence\". Everybody informs on everybody and trust becomes a liability: trusting means getting betrayed eventually. The past brings up its examples of this statement: people who should be trusted in life, in general, are actually great deceivers in the main character's life (her father, her step-father) and the ones that she actually trusts have however, an uncertain status. I can only interpret the open-ending taking this last phrase into account: everything is uncertain (is Paul an enemy or a friend, does he love her or does he mislead her, does he tell her the truth or everything regarding him is a big lie?) and the character doesn't know whom she can trust anymore. \"The trick is not to go mad.\" But how can you keep your mind in its right place when you are estranged in a world where values are fighting to convey a meaning that is totally opposite to the main one and everyone seems to consider this normal? How are you to fight with mad people in a world where everybody is mad and you are the only one who is different?The result is that in such a world you begin to become suspicious of everyone and value things which in normal societies you would take for granted: the fact that your body is whole and that all its parts are functional, that you have all the fingers, for instance, and that you can use them: \"Ever since I found the parcel wrapped like candy in my bag (she talks about a human finger she found in her bag after one of the sessions of interrogation), I use my forefinger (when she is making sketches), crooking and twisting it to follow the contours. I didn't check whether the severed finger could be bent.\"This book is splendid: full of meanings and conveying ideas without pointing them out. I relished its phrases and I read the most striking ones twice or even more times. They kept me pondering about the obscurity of communism and on how the terror turned people into beasts. They made me wonder if I had any right to blame nowadays people for still wearing their scars of the communism as they still do and this question will keep me wondering for quite a while.

I already knew a number of beautiful words having to do with lubricated hydraulic machine parts: DOVETAIL, GOOSENECK, ACORN NUTS, and EYEBOLTS, she says, and so I left off characterizing her plot structure as the shuttering swift sidings of looms and thought of maelstroms instead. Capturing the linear side of things is all very well, but we are no Arachne in our weaving and wiggling our way out of the unyielding desire of the eye.\nYou feel fine because you\u2019ve forgotten what that means for other people.\nThe Wiki page for the author already rhapsodized on about Kafka, so I'll save us both some ethos and think instead on past and future. If you let it, the narrative will explain all that needs be expounded, letting even a novice in Romanian tinged literature such as myself into its endless bowels. When the final page is turned, you'll have the comfort of your narrator's closure, for you'll know exactly how she came to be here and where she has utmost need to go. Whether you accept the lines drawn by death and madness by that point is another matter entirely.\nOn the way I thought: How bizarre that something so beautiful could be up in the sky, with no law down here on earth forbidding people to look at it.\nThe matter of her being a woman may be a turnoff to some, for the cruelty aimed so casually and frequently at female bodies is the same regardless of political leanings, souring those feel good leavings that horror stories of Communism inevitably leave on the democratically inclined. It's not nearly as difficult as Morrison and Jelinek, but it is said, and unlike the others dwells on many a tale of daughters fucking fathers (note the order and implicated position) and other sundry tales of female lust, so maybe there is something to be said about that Communism business in conjunction with the patriarchy. Or not, but whether 'twas meaning or null, it was worth noting, for superstitious warding off harm before the next appointment share with a sought out sex an ultimate need for control.\nFirst look left and then look right, son, to see if a car's coming. That's important when you're crossing a street but it's a dangerous way to think.\nHell hath no fury like a man offended."}, {"userName": "Jo\u00e3o Reis", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39677710-jo-o-reis", "userReview": "4,5 stars, but taking into account my mental state in the last months, it surely deserves being rounded up to 5.

During her first marriage (while husband was at the military service) she recalls she escaped home and went to the mountains (Carpatos mountains) with conservatory finalists; she saw frozen lakes\u2026and crosses of the dead; her peers picked up stones for healing but she picked a stone in the form of child\u2019s foot,... she still keeps it. She\u2019s been summoned to an interrogation at 10:00 a.m., sharp\u2026:\u201dinterrogations are a torment\u201d\u2026.\u201dthey are so long\u201d\u2026\u201done feels lost\u201d... \u201cToday I may be conducted to a prison cell, escorted by Albu major.\u201d Albu's head stinks French perfume \u201cAvril\u201d.In her dark bedroom she wonders how to kill time: she cannot sleep; \u201cit\u2019s easier to think about something luminous, snow\u2026\u201d. \u2026She names her blouses. Her second husband (Paul) is a drunken man:\u201dI drink because it tastes good\u201d. She wonders: you think with your tongue. People at that time drank a lot.

M\u00fcller belonged to the German minority living in Romania where she was born (1953). She had a bad experience under the dictator of Romania -she was under constant interrogation by the Securitate-theRomanian secret services.Her own father didn\u2019t speak about once belonging to the German SS; that was a taboo theme. Her mother went to a labor camp in the Soviet Union. The writer remembers that people \u201cstarved to death\u201d\u2026.and she got \u201cphysically disgusted\u201d.Herta studied German literature.In another book of Herta (\u201dNadirs\u201d) she depicts the dreadful life of a small village back in Romania. And then freedom: in 1987 she moved to West Berlin; she was amazed \u2026even shocked: everything colorful\u2026;\n she wrote \u201cTravel in one leg\u201d,the novel approaching this transition. At 56 years of age she received the Nobel Prize of literature.

It is representative for her style, which I personally find breathtaking. It is strong and sharp, expressing sadness, frustration and even a kind of guilt of living within an oppressive regime, like that one of Ceausescu. A regime that forced people to become cowards and to renounce their humanity; and those who cared about their conscience remained alone, very alone, isolated, unable to rely on somebody or something. Herta M\u00fcller does not forgive anybody, including herself. But what makes M\u00fcller to be a very special writer, in my opinion, is not only her obsession (with Securitate and Ceausescu), but her incredible force of playing with words, weaving them, creating wonderful and fresh associations, transforming ugliness in beauty. My favourite readings by her are \u201cNadirs\u201d (a collection of short stories), \u201cThe King Bows and Kills\u201d (essays about her youth in Banat), \u201cEverything I possessed I Carry With Me\u201d (what a cruel disappointment to find out that her best friend, the poet Oskar Pastior, who inspired her in writing this novel, had been a collaborationist himself!) and \u201cTravelling on One Leg\u201d (a very touching story about her experience in West Berlin, after her emigration from Romania).

On the way to a ten a.m. appointment with a major that she believes knows that she has done nothing wrong but who will anyway act as if it is his most urgent professional priority to unearth her many secret acts of treason, M\u00fcller's narrator recounts in nonlinear fashion life with her first husband, a friendship with a now-dead coquette, her grandparents' and parents' angular lives and sad, pointless love affairs, the absurd origins of her current political troubles, prior \"appointments\" with the major, and her meet-cute at a flea market and quiet but satisfying life with the alcoholic, motorcycle-riding Paul.I didn't love the elliptical format, but it was certainly effective. I felt like I never knew where the book would veer at any moment, and this was deeply unsettling. With each sentence, I never knew if I would be getting some mundane and boring detail about one of her fellow tram riders, some startling beautiful prose marrying local imagery to a piece of novel yet timeless and universal wisdom, or a clue about the mystery at the center of the book.

Thursday, ten sharp.So begins Herta Mueller\u2019s novel of one woman\u2019s life in Romania under the reign of Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu, and we soon learn that this is not the first time our unnamed narrator has been summoned to the office of a man known only as Major Albu for the purpose of interrogation. This isn\u2019t the first time, but for some reason, our narrator believes this interrogation will be worse than any of the interrogations that have gone before.And what is our narrator\u2019s crime? Sewing notes into the lining of ten white linen suits bound for Italy. \u201cMarry me,\u201d the notes say, along with the narrator\u2019s name and address. To her supervisor, Nelu, these notes are the same thing as prostitution while on the job, and our narrator is \u201cturned over\u201d to Major Albu. Then notes proclaiming \u201cBest Wishes from the Dictatorship\u201d are found in the lining of suits bound for Sweden, and then more notes in suits bound for yet a third country, and our narrator is fired from her job, though she tells us she didn\u2019t write the second and third batch. But that, of course, is irrelevant to Major Albu.The entire novel \u2013 my paperback copy was 214 pages \u2013 takes place during the unnamed narrator\u2019s tram ride to her appointment. The tram ride from the seventh floor apartment she shares with her second husband, the alcoholic Paul, until she misses her stop and gets off on the wrong street; a tram ride that takes about ninety minutes and for which she\u2019s risen particularly early.The tram ride to her appointment with Major Albu seems to trigger thoughts of just about everything in our narrator, expressed as a jumbled interior monologue, and the reader is privy to what seems to be her entire life. She remembers her father\u2019s indiscretions with a person Mueller calls \u201cthe woman with the braid\u201d and how our narrator wished to take that woman\u2019s place; she remembers her good friend, Lilli, who was shot and killed while trying to escape across the border to Hungary with her lover, a sixty-six year old military officer; she remembers her own indiscretions with Nelu, the garment factory supervisor with whom she had a brief affair, then rebuffed, leading him to betray her; she remembers how she met her current husband, Paul, at a flea market where she sold the wedding ring her first husband had given her; she remembers her first husband, who betrayed her grandparents; she remembers her former father-in-law, a man she refers to as \u201cthe Perfumed Commissar,\u201d who dispatched her grandparents to a forced labor camp while sitting astride the same white horse he rode when he confiscated the property of others.You\u2019ve probably guessed by now, but this is a book without a hero, a novel without a plot. That was fine with me. I love Ulysses. And as I was reading, I remembered that I loved another book with an antihero that took place entirely on a tram/train \u2013 Venedikt Erofeev\u2019s Moscow to the End of the Line. It\u2019s also reminiscent of Kafka\u2019s The Castle and The Trial in that it tells the story of someone who is summoned repeatedly for interrogations. The above books, however, are much better books than The Appointment.Rather than plot, this book\u2019s narrative consists of a jumbled, fragmented, and elliptical narrative. While it reads smoothly enough, and it\u2019s not at all difficult to keep track of the many jumps into the past and returns to the present, eventually, one begins to wonder if any of it is worth the trouble. The narrator isn\u2019t a sympathetic character at all. It\u2019s very difficult to empathize or sympathize with her, and not because she was living in Romania. The character of Lilli, I thought, who had quite a bit of spunk, would have made a much better protagonist than the numb-to-life narrator, but I feel Mueller used several autobiographical elements in building her unnamed narrator and really wouldn\u2019t have written her any other way.Another problem for me revolved around the interrogations that took place in Central Europe. Though I certainly don\u2019t mean to diminish them and know they were frightening for those who had to endure them, they just aren\u2019t the stuff that makes us want to sit up at night turning pages. We\u2019re too used to more brutal interrogation tactics and more brutal consequences. The serious Western reader is familiar with the works of Solzhenitsyn and has read about Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union at its very cruelest. With all due respect, what Mueller portrays in The Appointment can\u2019t begin to compare.Worse yet, there are no real scenes and set pieces in The Appointment. For me, this made it a dry book to read, one I plodded through and didn\u2019t enjoy at all. At one point, regarding her life in Romania, the unnamed narrator says, \u201cInstead of these thoughts we're constantly mulling over, it would be better to have the actual things inside your head, so you could reach in and touch them.\u201d I would have to answer, \u201cYes, infinitely better.\u201d This goes for novels, too. The reader can only take so much \u201ctelling\u201d as opposed to \u201cshowing\u201d before he or she grows weary enough to cast the book \u2013 and the author \u2013 aside. Being privy to the narrator\u2019s thoughts is one thing; reading a 200 plus interior monologue is quite another. There\u2019s some reward for the first, while the second is rarely, if ever, rewarded.The Nobel Committee got it right when they described Mueller\u2019s work as having \u201cno epic line, no plot with beginning and end.\u201d However, they were praising her books. I can\u2019t.At times, it seems as though the narrator is so worn down, she\u2019s given up. She says:Whenever I hear the elevator descending to fetch Albu\u2019s henchmen, I can hear his voice quietly in my head: Tuesday at ten sharp, Saturday at ten sharp, Thursday at ten sharp. How often, after closing the door, have I said to Paul: I\u2019m not going there anymore. Paul would hold me in his arms and say: If you don\u2019t go, they\u2019ll come and fetch you, and then they\u2019ll have you for good.I suppose that could be the point of the whole book \u2013 that life under Ceau\u015fescu was so taxing that many people simply gave up. I can believe that. I can and do have much sympathy for those who had to live under that grueling regime. However, \u201cgiving up\u201d doesn\u2019t make for good literature. And I suppose Mueller chose not to name her narrator as a way of identifying her as an \u201cEveryman\u201d in Romania, but for me, the practice of not naming a main character is just annoying and amounts to misplaced conceit.In some ways, though, the narrator, far from giving up, has herself become a mini Major Albu. She\u2019s very forceful when it comes to her attempts to get Paul to stop drinking even though she admits to herself and to the reader that those attempts are more than likely to come to naught. She complains that \u201cdrinkers never admit anything, not even silently to themselves \u2013 and they're not about to let anyone else squeeze it out of them, especially somebody who's waiting to hear the admission.\" Still, she tries.For me, sexual gratification played far too large a role in this novel. Just about everyone in the book seems to indulge in affairs with anyone and everyone they encounter. Pointless affairs that revolve around neither love nor lust. I thought, for the most part, these characters were far too worn down to indulge in affairs, which ultimately compounded their problems while bringing no relief from the boredom and drudgery that made up their days. The sex struck a very false note to me. I felt like it was inserted arbitrarily.The Appointment is a book in translation (it was originally written in German; I read it in English), and even allowing for that translation, some of the author\u2019s word choices are strange, to say the least. For example, at one point, the narrator likens the effect the interrogations have on her to \u201cthe way the roof of your mouth rises up and glues itself onto your brain.\u201d For me, at least, that was just odd, and it lacked power because it was so bizarre.Although Paul has been fired from the engine plaint where he worked (he was making contraband TV antennas that would pick up stations in Bucharest and Budapest), our narrator still thinks about the showers he took at the plant and the way the other workers would steal his clothes. Thinking of this, and comparing it to her appointments with Albu, the narrator says, \u201cIt's humiliating, there's no other word for it, when your whole body feels like it's barefoot. But what if there aren't any words at all, what if even the best word isn't enough.\u201dFor me, \u201c\u2026your whole body feels like it\u2019s barefoot\u201d is also bizarre. Does Mueller mean she feels ashamed, as though she\u2019s without clothes in public? If so, I think she would have been better off to simply write that rather than compare the feeling to an entire body feeling as though it\u2019s barefoot.And then there are the run-on sentences: \u201cA breeze was rustling in the ash trees, I listened to the leaves, perhaps Paul was listening to the water.\u201d Or \u201cThe giant blue mailbox is in front of the post office, how many letters can it take.\u201d And why did the author dispense with question marks at the end of questions? I have to put this down to conceit, like the nameless narrator, because dispensing with question marks at the end of a question is not standard practice in German.There were times, however, when I found the description in this novel to be lovely. One of those times occurs when the narrator is describing her widowed mother\u2019s lack of affect:When she dried herself she became like the towel, when she cleared the dishes she became like the table, and she became like the chair when she sat down.I still prefer \u201cshowing\u201d to \u201ctelling\u201d but if one has to \u201ctell\u201d then telling like the above is both graceful and effective.The prevailing mood of The Appointment is one of tremendous ennui. The narrator is far too worn down to feel any hate, bitterness, or antipathy. She\u2019s reached a stage where resistance is no longer possible. I\u2019ve heard some people say The Appointment is too bleak and hopeless for American readers. I disagree. While many Americans do love their happy endings, readers of highly literary novels love bleakness. They embrace it. I liked the subject matter around which the novel revolved. I just didn\u2019t like that way the author wrote about it.In the end, I think the book can be summed up in this short paragraph, one of the best paragraphs in the entire novel:Each shoreline was marked by wooden crosses set in the rocks, bearing the dates on which people had drowned. Cemeteries underwater and crosses all around \u2013 portents of dangerous times to come. As if all those round lakes were hungry and needed their yearly ration of meat delivered on the dates inscribed. Here no one dived for the dead: the water would snuff out life in an instant, chilling you to the bone in a matter of seconds.In The Appointment, the energy it took to monitor one\u2019s thoughts, words, and actions 24/7 was enough to \u201csnuff out life in an instant,\u201d and I think, at times, the narrator, herself, would have preferred being chilled to the bone in one of those watery graves.1/5Recommended: No. The book is too pointless and burdensome to read. The interior monologue is exhausting. The reader is left with no lasting image, no reward for having read. However, this is the impression the book left on me; I know people who loved it, so always keep the subjective component of literature in mind.Read my book reviews and tips for writers at www.literarycornercafe.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Janet Leszl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1208750-janet-leszl", "userReview": "I had to force myself to keep reading this one.

There were so many endless side tangents that had tangents running away from them as well. Often I had to question what the point behind them was. At times she revealed elements of living under the repressive authorities, but it took a long and jumpy ride to get there. The last line of the novel is \u201cThe trick is not to go mad\u201d. I guess the style of writing was to demonstrate how she had indeed gone mad from the fear of being summoned for questioning and what might happen as a result.

It is a very unsettling read, you can't really settle down in to normal expectations and maybe that is Muller's intention. You struggle with the heroine as she suffers continual persecution by the police authorities but it is written cleverly. She journeys towards her next appointment and this journey is punctuated by flashbacks building up a clearer and clearer picture of her past and its implications. I was confused by the ending but that perhaps says more about me than the novelist or her translator"}, {"userName": "Roya", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22146366-roya", "userReview": "\u0628\u06cc\u0634 \u062a\u0631 \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u06cc \u0645\u0647\u0631\u062f\u0627\u062f \u0648\u062b\u0648\u0642\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0639\u062c\u06cc\u0628 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u060c \u0686\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0628\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0638\u0631 \u0645\u06cc \u0631\u0633\u06cc\u062f\u060c \u0648 \u067e\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0642\u06cc \u0647\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0628\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0631 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u06cc \u0648 \u0622\u0645\u0648\u0632\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\u062f\u060c \u062a\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u062f\u0627\u060c \u0628\u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062c\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u06cc \u0622\u062e\u0631 \u0631\u0627 \u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u0647\u0645 \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u060c \u062c\u0630\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0648 \u0627\u062b\u0631\u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u062c\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u06cc \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u0686\u0647 \u062c\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647! \u0645\u0642\u0627\u06cc\u0633\u0647 \u06a9\u0646\u06cc\u062f\u0647\u0631\u062a\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0631 \u0645\u06cc \u06af\u0648\u06cc\u062f: The trick is not to go mad ... \u0645\u0647\u0631\u062f\u0627\u062f \u0648\u062b\u0648\u0642\u06cc \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u0646\u062f: \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062d\u0642\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc \u062e\u062a\u0645 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u0634\u0648\u062f !!!"}, {"userName": "Karin Baele", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36444316-karin-baele", "userReview": "Pure horror is het, maar geschreven als met een ganzenveer zonder inkt.

The narrator is on a tram, once again heading to face another interrogation by Ceausescu\u2019s secret police, and while she heads to this appointment she recounts various moments in her life, allowing the reader an inside look into another world, one that is difficult to imagine, yet M\u00fcller\u2019s descriptions are spot on. With breath-taking beauty, M\u00fcller details with precision the simple, the mundane, the everyday scenes of life to show the reader a world of deprivation and a certain acceptance to maintain sanity in a society filled with black marketers, long lines for drink and food, plenty of one yet not the other, government owned shops, and the utter helplessness brought onto the people under such a regime. M\u00fcller\u2019s writings brought back to me the sights, sounds and smells of the Former Soviet Union, the grays and blacks, the oneness and lack of free will. While The Appointment does not take place in the former USSR, rather Romania, it was not difficult for me to envision. I fear I have not done justice to this literary masterpiece. I would recommend The Appointment to anyone who would like a look into another culture and what it is like to live without the freedoms so many of us take for granted. As for myself, I plan to read a non-translated version to see what, if anything was lost."}, {"userName": "Simona", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6222130-simona", "userReview": "Ho deciso di leggere questo libro perch\u00e9 mi ha colpito il titolo e perch\u00e9 molte volte, troppe nella mia vita avrei preferito non incontrarmi, non esistere, sfuggire a me stessa, proprio come accade alla protagonista.Dopo un approccio alquanto difficile, in quanto dovevo abituarmi al suo stile, mi sono pian piano innamorata di questo libro e di questa scrittrice.

Again there is that same threatening atmosphere that hangs over all sentences. Starting with the opening sentence \"I am summoned, Thursday at 10 am exactly\", it is difficult to be more kafkaesque. What follows is the story of a woman (without name) traveling by tramway to the place where she will be questioned for the umpteenth time. En route she muses in a chaotic jumble of fragments about her life, and we get to know largely similar figures as in \u201cHerztier\u201d. Individual deprivation, life gone stale, subtle and less subtle forms of terror are ubiquitous; it is as if the \"unbearable lightness\" of Kundera with M\u00fcller has been replaced by \"leaden heaviness\". Again that's totally reflected in the language in which M\u00fcller writes her books: she uses fragmented, twisted phrases, with a kind of poetic flavor, that put you constantly on your guard whether there\u2019s more to it than meets the eye. M\u00fcller has a way to describe everyday situations, even plain objects, in such a way that she seems to deliver a much broader message, or maybe not. Perhaps it is her way to illustrate how suspicion in a dictatorship also nests itself in the language, and that is quite ingenious. But it also accounts for very tough work for the reader. I have to admit: her work is intriguing and even interesting, but I'm afraid it didn't really appeal to me."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/556887-matt", "userReview": "A really pretty amazing book, and one that is sort of different than it's description-- there's none of the rompiness you'd expect from a book about a woman who randomly solicits italian men to marry her and save her from Communist Romania. I'm not saying that doesn't happen, though I think that's misrepresented, just that it's not at the core of the book.What is at the heart of the book, I think, is the relationship between our narrator, the woman who has in the past sent these notes abroad, and her lover, Paul. The book itself is a rumination on love in totalitarian cultures that really is a lot like 1984, if you take that book as primarily interested in the way such cultures deform and complicate love.I think I like this one better than '84-- the character seem richer, and there's a more engaging narrative gambit, dealing mostly with one bus ride, and what occurs to the narrator along the way. But I suppose your mileage may vary. Really, a bracing, dynamic, challenging and deeply enjoyable book."}, {"userName": "\u0627\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8168485", "userReview": "\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0643\u0645\u0644\u0647\u0627..\u0642\u062f \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628\u0629 \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u064a\u0631"}, {"userName": "Niki Vervaeke", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5761615-niki-vervaeke", "userReview": "Een boek waarvan je zelf helemaal droefgeestig wordt.

The book's style is somewhat stream-of-consciousness-- we follow the main character, who is a resident of communist Romania and is periodically interrogated regarding an incident from years ago in which she slipped notes into the pockets of the jackets she manufactured reading \"Please marry me\". In the book, she is currently traveling to one of these interrogations, and we are privy to the thoughts and memories this trip conjures up.I suppose what the book conveys best is the effect of terror on the individual's mind-- her thoughts are erratic, wildly unhinged in time, in content, in character. We learn about her life very sporadically-- she reveals some memories in great detail all at once, others are hinted at multiple times before they're finally brought to light. In the end, I didn't feel like I knew the character well enough-- I felt like the scraps I'd been given were miserly, and that they didn't cohere particularly well. It reminded me of the end of The Golden Notebook, in which Anna Wulf essentially loses her mind for a month or so. And I think that's the point: one of the sentences that has stuck with me is something along the lines of: \"The hardest thing is to stay sane.\"Now, I've read lots of books about living under repressive regimes, and I could guess what forces make sanity a difficult thing to maintain, but Muller herself doesn't give you much insight. The interrogations happen; but why was the main character so desperate to leave in the first place, that she would offer herself up to any man who happened to find a note in the pocket of his new jacket? She recounts stories of her grandfather's experiences when the regime was initially established, and these are sufficiently ghoulish, but the main character herself-- what has she experienced? From what we're given in the book, mainly failed relationships, not political repression.Although, perhaps that's the point: the main character herself is not a political rebel, not a member of any resistance group; she is, instead, a woman who is desperately searching for love, and the whimsical actions she takes are made into political actions by the regime."}, {"userName": "Netts", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5439497-netts", "userReview": "The fact that I grew up in communist Romania has a lot to do with how much I disliked this book. I don't think I would have loved the stilted style in any case, because I generally tend to find internal monologue narratives irritating. It's pretty hard to get that kind of voice to sound both plausible and engaging. But she won the Nobel Prize so I was cautiously optimistic, even though the year was 2009 and Obama got one just for showing up. (As an aside, the Swedish Academy rejected the likes of Tolstoy, Nabokov and Mark Twain so their judgement has always been pretty questionable.) The thing that truly bothered me about this is how it's billed as a work illustrative of life under Ceausescu's regime. It is bleak and oppressive and leaves one feeling isolated and confused so in that sense it could be said that it is a reflection on those years. But Kafka did that kind of thing long before and better and without political pretensions. Several Eastern Block writers have done so too with a dark sense of absurd humor that is much more authentic, at least to my experience (Andrey Kurkov springs to mind). I discussed this book with a Romanian friend who quipped that it was a humorless German view of the tragicomedy of Romanian life in the communist years. I can't express it any better than that. In the end what rang most false are the mundane but incongruous details: the descriptions of streets and shops and daily routines. They seemed expressionist and artificial rather than testimonial (Ex. Where were these dive bars that were open at all hours of the day? Just one of the details that would sound believable if you had lived elsewhere but completely imaginary to Romanians who lived through communism. And once you start to mess with reality for effect, it gets a lot harder to trust the veracity of everything else. You can bear witness or you can warp reality to provide poetic reflection but if you do both at once neither is going to ring true.) I wouldn't have minded so much if this had not been billed (in the synopsis and in every review though notably not in the book itself) as bearing witness to a time and place with which I was personally familiar. I can see how this book could be touching and profound but, caught in the web of its own pretentious artifice, it fails to reflect a real time and place, which would have been far more interesting."}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1421407-janet", "userReview": "So far I don't find this as absorbing a book as the Land of Green Plums, the first HM book I'd read, ten or more years ago... as an icy plunge into life under one of the worst of the Eastern Bloc regimes, Ceausescu's Romania... this one is emotionally drier, the flatness of life where you're the only one who cares about your own life and sometimes not even that. Where great loves and friendships must be kept at arm's length in the the heart so not to rip you to shreds when they are endangered or lost. The protagonist is a girl eventually fired from her factory job when she's informed on by her immediate boss/coworker-- with whom she has to keep working after he's informed on her--that she's sewed notes into the pockets of the suits heading for Italy and 'her Marcellos', \"marry me.\" We come to like her drunken, vulnerable second husband as we see him tormented by his factory co-workers and perhaps beset by political police--is an accident just an accident? And see the compromised lives of her family and relationships with her exasperated first husband... how the despair and also passion that springs up through the cracks distorts these lives... all as she rides to her appointment for interrogation on the tram. My biggest complaint is that we lose sight of this, the horror of it, --the character's ability to mentally range throughout the events of her current and more distant life seem to indicate less fear than an attitude of 'nuisance' about this coming appointment. So the flatness of the writing, while psychologically apt, a woman trapped in such a claustrophobic world and trying to stay sane, works against the story's ability to involve us. Much must be read between the lines. Yet the writing is superb. I give it four stars so far**********Finished it, and it definitely takes on both emotional weight and narrative speed as it heads down the home stretch. We do feel her peril, her boyfriend's peril, the loathing of family and the trap of politics, of nation. Well worth staying with it."}], "description": "Traqu\u00e9e, harcel\u00e9e, humili\u00e9e.
