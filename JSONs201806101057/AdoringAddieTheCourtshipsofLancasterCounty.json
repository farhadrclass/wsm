Her parents are persistent that she marry Phillip in honor and obedience to them, but Addie's head is turned by another man. Jonathan Mosier's family has moved back to Lancaster County after living in another Amish community for several years. Upon meeting Jonathan, Addie's senses are heightened and she knows she's in love. Jonathan shares her attraction but their lives become chaotic because of their attraction. The Cramers and Mosiers have held a longstanding grudge against one another, and both families are unwilling to forgive and forget. Addie is forbidden to see Jonathan which only adds bitterness and despair to her unhappiness. An Amish Romeo and Juliet, Jonathan and Addie do everything in their power to overcome the unforgiving feelings that still have a hold on their families.Leslie Gould has penned another beautiful Amish love tale, a facsimile to the well-known story of Romeo and Juliet, a story of obedience and compromise. Written with multiple levels and several diverse characters, the author has combined these elements into a well-told and successful novel. Numerous emotions are characterized, and examples of mental health issues, including depression, anger and alcoholism are depicted in an open and direct style. Forgiveness is the archetype the Amish manifest in their beliefs, and is at the core of this well-written story. I previously read and thoroughly enjoyed Courting Cate, and this second book in The Courtships of Lancaster County is no disappointment! I look forward to the sequel in this series.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from Bethany House Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

Addie and Jonathan have fallen in love but have to figure out what caused the huge rift/feud between their families before the family will bless their relationship. This story also deals with alcoholism and depression in several of the characters. Having both issues in my own family, I certainly could relate to the feelings of pain associated with them. The Amish in Leslie's story do address the issues but I will not reveal a great deal as I don't wish to spoil the story for readers. I loved this book and was definitely rooting for dear Addie to find love and acceptance within her Amish home and community. I think those are things we all long to have, aren't they? This book can give some insight into the handling of the issues. I appreciate the way Leslie's characters are \"real\": they may be Amish, but they have their struggles to deal with too.

Then as I kept reading they started to sort themselves out and the book really got interesting. In fact I couldn't put the book down until I finished it - in one sitting! It was that captivating. I just had to find out how it all worked out.My favorite character was Addie. Once she decided she knew what she wanted she wasn't afraid to speak her mind. Nineteen years old and completely used by her parents. As the only daughter it was her job to take care of her mother and do everything her father told her to do. That was until they planned the rest of her life and would not listen to her about what she wanted. Did she know what she wanted? Yes she did but the family was determined she was going to have what they wanted. At what cost?The story line had a Romeo & Juliet, Hatfield's & McCoy's feel to it but was very well done by the author.

But worse than continuous laundry and cooking are the expectations Addie\u2019s parents have placed on her. Although her older brothers are having a wild running around time, driving cars and attending parties, Addie is expected to settle down and marry a good Amish man\u2014and they have their heart set on Philip Eicher, the Bishop\u2019s son. Addie will admit that Philip is a nice man, but despite all the time they spend together, she knows she could never love him. But Addie longs to escape her parents\u2019 farm and have some independence. Is marrying Philip the only way to achieve this?Before Addie is forced to settle for a marriage of convenience, she runs into a newcomer to Lancaster County\u2014Jonathan Mosier. The Cramers and Mosiers have long had a family feud that has kept them from interacting with each other. Despite asking both her parents and her aunt, no one will explain what the original cause of the feud is. Addie isn\u2019t going to let an unexplainable, twenty-five-year-old dispute stop her from enjoying life\u2014especially when a chance encounter with Jonathan causes her to wonder if he might be her ticket off the farm, not Philip. But can they convince their families to set aside their differences and allow them to be happy together? Or will this feud be far harder to break than either of them expected?As with the first book in the series, Courting Cate, the Shakespearean play upon which this plot is based isn\u2019t one that I\u2019m overly familiar with. Most people in the Western world will have heard of Romeo and Juliet, but I\u2019m afraid my knowledge is limited to the 1996 film with Leonardo DiCaprio. I was intrigued to see how Leslie would manage to adapt the play into a romance novel with a happy ending, given that Romeo and Juliet end up dead by the end of the play. I\u2019m not sure why people tote this play as being one of the best love stories of all time, to be entirely honest. But thankfully, the ending to this novel was not so tragic. You don\u2019t have to have read the original play in order to enjoy Adoring Addie, but I did enjoy some of the references\u2014the balcony outside Addie\u2019s bedroom and her father\u2019s nickname of \u201cCap\u201d. The ending (which I don\u2019t want to spoil for any potential readers) impressed me, retaining some of the aspects of the conclusion to Romeo and Juliet without, obviously, both the hero and heroine ending up dead. The only aspect which I thought could have been improved upon was the way in which Addie and Jonathan fall in love. I know that the idea of love at first sight is in keeping with the original play, but I struggled to believe that Addie and Jonathan could feel so strong about each other after knowing each other for a few hours. I could overlook the improbability of a long-lasting family grudge or a balcony on an Amish house, but I\u2019m afraid that I wasn\u2019t convinced by the strength of Addie\u2019s love for Jonathan after such a short period of time. I know that I\u2019m not the only romance reader who isn\u2019t a fan of love at first sight in any context. This didn\u2019t completely spoil my enjoyment of this novel, but I did feel that this was one aspect of the story that could have been altered from the original text to better fit a modern context.I initially struggled with how cruel Addie\u2019s family members were towards her and the Mosiers, and I was worried that they might come across as caricatures with no real motivations. But as the story developed, I came to appreciate the truth in Leslie\u2019s depiction of how a grudge can cause bitterness and resentment that breaks a family apart. I\u2019ve never experienced a family feud, but I have witnessed the hurt that can result in a family when one member insists on fostering a grudge. Other members of the family are forced to either go along with it, so as not to be alienated, or try to ignore the situation as best they can, as Addie does. It\u2019s not easy being in Addie\u2019s position, when you disagree with a parent\u2019s treatment of someone, and I hurt alongside her as she bore the brunt of her parents\u2019 and siblings\u2019 bitterness and resentment for daring to go against their wishes.I was pleasantly surprised when the larger story about the Cramer family was expanded to examine some of the reasons behind certain characters\u2019 behaviours and actions. Hannah\u2019s melancholy, Timothy\u2019s drinking and Addie\u2019s mother\u2019s selfishness were all explored as the story developed into a discussion about mental illness. Hannah\u2019s\u2014Addie\u2019s cousin\u2014story was the one that probably touched me the most, because I know first-hand how difficult it is for family members to acknowledge teenage depression. I commend Leslie for tackling a topic that is often overlooked or dismissed as simply teenage moodiness or rebellion. I hadn\u2019t heard about having a genetic disposition towards depression before, so this was an interesting concept to learn about. I was also pleased with the way Timothy\u2019s\u2014Addie\u2019s older brother\u2014story evolved, regarding his drinking and rebellion. It\u2019s very easy to look down on someone for getting drunk without wondering why they feel the need to drink that much. I did wish that Addie\u2019s mother\u2019s story had been explored more. She was the cruelest character in the entire book, and although we later learn about the guilt that has caused her to act this way, it felt like this part of the story was wrapped up too easily. Her change of heart felt too swift and painless to be real. Courting Cate had a similar ending, with two characters who had teased Cate throughout her life apologising and changing their ways at the drop of a hat, and Cate forgiving them just as easily. I know that the Amish are famous for the way they embrace forgiveness, but given the context of this story, it felt like Addie\u2019s mother\u2019s change of heart happened a bit too quickly. Despite the implausibility of a large part of this story, it did include a lot of realism. Some Amish novels present the lifestyle in a romanticised fashion, but Adoring Addie didn\u2019t fall into that trap. It portrayed the Amish as flawed human beings who feel jealousy and argue with their relatives, who struggle with illness and get bored of housework. Having Addie\u2019s older brothers drive cars, live in a run-down trailer and attend wild parties definitely helped with the realism, as well as the struggles of the parents to deal with their teenagers\u2019 behaviour. Small details like Addie cooking spaghetti and taco salad, and her younger brothers playing with toy bows and arrows made her family feel just like any other\u2014except for giant family feud, of course!Although I struggled with a few aspects of this story, Adoring Addie was a thoroughly enjoyable novel and a great addition to Leslie\u2019s Courtships of Lancaster County series. Even if you\u2019re not a fan of Shakespeare or love at first sight romances, I encourage fans of Amish fiction to check out this series. Leslie Gould definitely brings something refreshing and new to the genre, and I hope she\u2019s here to stay.

The entire series of The Courtships of Lancaster County is going to be based upon William Shakespeare's plays, and this one was Romeo and Juliet. This tale has it's own unique spin.At first Addie is being strongly pushed to marry Phillip Eicher, the Bishop's son, but her heart is not set on him at all. She feels nothing for him, yet her parents are making her feel so bad by saying she is going against their wishes. She feels nothing for him. Later, when she finds out Jonathan Mosier has moved back to Lancaster County, now her heart goes aflutter. Addie and Jonathan would sneak off to the creek together, but every time they did, they got caught! There really wasn't enough romance between the two to make this 'feel' like a super good Romeo and Juliet.There is a huge problem. Unfortunately, the two families don't have this couple, Addie and Jonathan in mind for each other because there is a rift between the two families, and has been for quite a while as it is demonstrated as a fight breaks out between someone in each family, and Jonathan happens to get in the middle of it, and he gets hurt ending up in the hospital.The rift between the two families has to do with mental illness and an addiction problem. I thought that was really a good thing to bring up with the Amish. Not only do Englisher's suffer from this, but so do the Amish, and this brought a little bit of reality to the story which I do like to see in the Amish books.Even though the one woman has an issue more so which is what is causing the rift between the families, the two fathers get along great! Perhaps there is a chance for Addie and Jonathan?Cate makes an appearance in this book, so that was nice to see.If you would like to read this series in order, then go ahead and first grab Courting Cate, then pick up this book! The next book will be Minding Molly based upon A Midsummer Night's Dream, Book 3 in the Courtships of Lancaster County.This concludes my review of the story, except to say this story does NOT involve 'Tragedy' as does Shakespeare's play does, thankfully! So for those of you who are interested in this book, that is about it except for the rest of my review which has SPOILERS IN IT, so if you want to read this book, then STOP HERE.***SPOILER ALERT HERE!!! Stop reading if you are planning on reading this book! Jonathan gets hurt, is in the hospital with the family all around him, and they think he died. Aren't there monitors hooked up to you when you are in a hospital bed and unconscious? The family thought he was dead, but the machine would be beeping if he was doing just fine. If he had died or had a problem, then the machines would be going crazy, especially if his heart stopped, nurses and doctors would be running frantically working on him to bring him back, etc. I know these people are Amish, but there would be a frenzy going on! There was not. Or, if he did pass, the hospital would not just let him lay there.Addie has a balcony. Did we get a balcony scene? No. Why not? Why even mention it?In Romeo and Juliet, the balcony scene is the most famous scene of all! I was sad that nothing happened with this. Why did the author even talk about Addie having a balcony if nothing was going to happen?There were a few other things that could have been done differently to make it feel a little more like Romeo and Juliet, such a Jonathan giving Addie flowers, or surprising her with something romantic, but nothing romantic happened. We just didn't get enough romance in this book.This didn't feel like a very romantic Romeo and Juliet that I would have expected. We needed more romance! We didn't get hardly any, and yes, I'm boo-hoo'ing!I usually love Leslie Gould's writing very much, so when I found out the next book was going to be based on Romeo and Juliet, I was really excited for this one, only to be let down. One could argue, I guess, that the master story teller of Romeo and Juliet was, after all, Shakespeare, so . . . ? We just wanted a little more in this book than what was delivered.I received this book for FREE from the Publisher, Bethany House and NetGalley in exchange to read and write a review about it.

Both books were really good but this one was simply my favorite of the two. The characters were enjoyable and easy to relate to.\n\n\nAddie Cramer\u2019s parents are set on her marrying Phillip Eicher and are furious when she begins to show an interest in Jonathan Mosier. I have to admit that Phillip drove me nuts. He was annoying and just irritated me. This of course was the desired emotion the author obviously wished to invoke.The Cramer\u2019s disdain for Jonathan stems from a decades old feud between the Mosier and the Cramer Family. Their hatred clouds their mind and skews their ideas about Jonathan, who actually is a really stand up kind of guy and a great Christian to boot! The real reason for the feud is discovered by Addie and it\u2019s a very tricky situation to deal with. This leads to a good bit of soul searching and thought on Addie\u2019s part on how to best deal with and diffuse the feud\u2014bringing peace and healing to both families.This book deals with situations of alcoholism and depression that will really make you connect with these characters. They seem so lifelike! I\u2019ve read a good bit of skepticism about how one can retell such a tragic story such as Romeo and Juliet in a lighthearted Amish tale but the author captured the tale perfectly!I am very eager to pick up the entire series. Most retellings are typical and annoying. These are a bit unique as they\u2019re in an Amish setting and they\u2019re much more lighthearted than secular tales.

Addie has been saddled with much of the child care for her two younger brothers, plus all the cooking and most of the housekeeping for everyone. Her mother is whiny and depressed, while her father is severe and stoic--nursing a feud between him and the Mosier family--a very un-Amish-like behavior. Addie would love to get away from this Cinderella-like existence, but to do that would involve getting married. Addie likes the idea of marriage, but not the Bishop's son, Phillip, her parents have decided she should wed. While Addie is trying her best to please her seemingly unpleasable parents, her two oldest brothers are going through Rumspringa. This is the time that teens often try a little, or a lot, of life outside Amish restrictions. Addie's oldest brother, Timothy, is drinking almost every night, driving recklessly, and developing a foul temper justifying his behavior because of Rumspringa. He seems to search out members of the Mosier family to cause them trouble, or even physical harm. Addie's parents look the other way regarding Timothy's behavior.By chance, Addie and Jonathan Mosier meet and instantly become besotted with each other. This is the story of whether or not the love Addie and Jonathan have for each other will have a future. Both sets of parents are horrified to have their children interested in each other. Will Timothy find a way to hurt, or do something even worse, to Jonathan? Will Addie's parents be successful in forcing her to marry Phillip? Will the original source of the feud come to light, and are there new details to change everyone's feelings?To be honest, I didn't like this book very much at first. Addie's life seemed so hard and harsh, without any chance of things getting better for her, that I had to force myself to keep reading it. I ultimately did like how the story turned out. The characters are well developed, and the tale is told well.

She is guarded and sheltered, so when her parents arrange her marriage to a young man named Phillip, she doesn't put up much of a fuss. And then she meets Jonathon Mosier. Addie and Jonathon's families have been at each other for years, and now the only thing that these two young people know is that the age old argument is keeping them apart.I did like how this was kind of a \"Romeo and Juliet\" spin-off, but I also think that the author could have done so much more with this story. / / P r o s / /\u2022 I really liked the names of the main characters. Addie is sweet and original, and Jonathan is strong a biblical.\u2022I really love spin-offs of old stories and fairy tales. This one kind of resembled William Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet in the plot. There was even the \"death\" scene in the end. You know, minus the death. It's hard to explain.\u2022This is Amish Fiction, and I LOVE Amish Fiction./ / C o n s / / \u2022There really wasn't going on in the beginning of the book. I think that some slow readers might get exasperated with it and put it back on the shelf.\u2022When things DID start to happen, they happened at a ridiculously fast pace. The very first time Jonathan and Addie met, they decided they were in love and were going to end up married. How can you even love someone that you know nothing about?! They may be a stinkin' kidnapper for all you know! Crazy! Infatuation at first sight I can believe. Love? Not so much. A real love takes time to develop.\u2022It just really paled in comparison to the first book in this series.If you were looking for a sweet, Amish Fiction to pass the time, there are definitely worse books out there. If you want a nail biter, I would pass.N o t e :: I was provided with a free copy of Adoring Addie from the publisher for preview purposes.

Because the plot is built around such a well-known tale, it is predictable overall. I enjoyed \"Adoring Addie,\" but not quite as much as \"Courting Cate,\" which is based on \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" a story-line unfamiliar to me. Knowing the path that a story is going to take spoils the surprise of what will happen next. Addie and Jonathan fall in love early in the novel. The love-at-first-sight scenario disappoints me as a reader, but Addie and Jonathan's struggle to bring harmony between their families helped me to overlook my \"pet peeve.\"Gould's characterization of the Amish differentiates both \"Adoring Addie\" and \"Courting Cate\" from other Amish novels that I have read in the past. Her characters face real-life problems, without their lives seeming overly quaint or overly oppressive. Details as small as Addie preparing taco salads for dinner make Gould's characters seem less disconnected from mainstream culture. Gould strikes a balance between the charm of Amish life and reality that Amish face problems similar to the rest of modern society.\"Adoring Addie\" is a pleasurable romance, adapted from \"Romeo and Juliet,\" minus the tragic ending. The main characters and their hardships are well-developed to create a story of love, forgiveness, and truth. Gould adds dimension with her secondary plots, particularly with Addie's brother, Timothy. There seems to be definite potential for a future novel based on Timothy. While I didn't fully adore \"Adoring Addie,\" I definitely plan to read the future books in the \"Courtships of Lancaster County\" series.I received a complimentary e-copy of this novel from Netgalley, courtesy of Bethany House.

However, after reading Courting Cate, this substantially fell short. I think picking the tragic love story of Romeo and Juliet was just too much to bit off and chew.Spoilers*******First off: Trying to take a tragic love story, that is well known for its' tragedy, and make it a happy ending story really doesn't work. I am not saying that I wanted them all to die. But having the characters simply \"sleeping\" at the hospital and the parents all thinking they had died? I was seriously disappointed. First off, they are at a hospital, so Addie would have been hooked up to a heart monitor, and even she could see that he was breathing.2nd: The love between Addie and Johnathan was non existent, where was the immediate attraction between them, and the palmer's kiss? The idea of Romeo being a ladies man and \"kissing by the book\". There was just so much lacking. Probably the biggest disappointment for me was she had a balcony; and her having the only room with the balcony, you waited for the midnight visit and loving vows. Yet it was never used! She kept trying to sneak out to the creak to see him, and kept getting caught. If he had climbed to the balcony they could have seen each other more.Finally: The conflict between families was tragically underdone. It all came down to a petty hurt female who decided to get revenge. And she is not a very nice person to begin with. But it seems that a friendship that both fathers supposedly had, would not be broken by a female who was mad, and letters that were weird to begin with. Then the fact that the children and friends were all angry too, made no sense.I guess really I just think the author missed the point. Romeo and Juliet is known as much for it's famous tragic ending as anything ever could be. But there are also things that Shakespeare implemented that made it equally famous, the balcony scene, the fight between Romeo and Tibalt, etc. All these things are what make the story famous, not just the death. I feel saddened to not like this one as much as her first which was amazing."}, {"userName": "Michelle Woods", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11016088-michelle-woods", "userReview": "Title: Adoring AddieAuthor: Leslie GouldPages: 341Year: 2013Publisher: Bethany Publishing HouseThis novel follows an only daughter, Addie Cramer, in a family of eight. She is shouldered with the household responsibilities as her mothers in overcome with depression and has been for most of her married life.When Addie meets Jonathan Mosier they fall in love at first sight. Unfortunately a feud between the two families threatens their relationship much like Romeo and Juliet. Add to that the bishop\u2019s son believes Addie should be his wife and the pot full of trouble boils over.Leslie Gould is a new author to me. I have read other Amish books, but this one is quite different. I guess the different Amish communities differ from forms of speech to mannerisms. But I found the difference between this community and the ones I\u2019ve read before distracting.Leslie explained to me that she used language and mannerisms on the Amish people she spent time with and others she's observed, both in person and in documentaries and recordings. I can appreciate that.The love story is sweet and the message of God\u2019s love and desire to have a personal relationship is beautifully illustrated. Jonathan comes from a different Amish community and shares with Addie about the love of God.\u201cBut God adores you, Addie. Far more than I even do \u2013which is saying a lot.

I LOVED this book and I LOVE Leslie!!! She is a fabulous writer! I love this Amish rendition of Romeo and Juliet even more than Shakespeare's original! I have loved this whole series' concept from the very beginning and enjoy the way Leslie weaves Shakespeare's classics in Amish settings! Cate, Bob, Pete, Betsy, Mervin, Martin, etc. from Courting Cate make reappearances in this sequel and help throughout the story. I love how this book plays out. From the beginning I enjoyed how Leslie had the characters fall in love slower. Yes it could still be considered \"love at first sight\" and yes they do fall in love the first day, but it felt like it had enough time to develop instead of just glimpsing each other and BAM! they're in love! LOL! All of the characters are wonderful! And Leslie does a fantastic job of expressing the frustrating aspects of Addie's parents attempting to force her to marry someone she doesn't love! I even love Jonathan more than the original Romeo! His Faith and passion made me fall in love with him right along with Addie! :D Some of my favorite scenes from the play appear in there own ways; such as the party scene where they meet. And I really have come to love the first person way Leslie writes in; it made me feel closer with Addie and more involved with what she goes through. The only grammatical thing that I personally don't like is the He when referring to The Lord isn't capitalized, but I digress! From great twists to a fantastic end I love this book through and through! I can't wait to read Minding Molly!!!Songs: \"How Great Thou Art\" Carrie Underwood, \"'Tis So Sweet To Trust In Jesus\" by Alan Jackson, and while all the lyrics of this song may not match this book overall it does and I just love this song! :) \"Overcomer\" by MandisaSongs may change in the future.Revelations 21:5~ASC*I received this Book from Bethany House because I was interested in it and wanted to review it this in no way affected my opinion and the above are my true thoughts and feelings. ~ASC"}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7974364-melissa", "userReview": "I recently was given the chance to read a wholesome story of faith, romance and strength. Adoring Addie by Leslie Gould is the second story in the series The Courtships of Lancaster County and it is a wonderfully written story. Here is a brief summary of the book.Not since Romeo and Juliet has a couple faced odds this long, the Cramers and Mosiers have been angry with each other for as long as any one can remember. Things had cooled to a simmer\u2026until Addie Cramer and Jonathan Mosier fell head over heels for each other. Now old tensions are renewed, and Addie\u2019s parents insist she marry stolid and uninspiring Phillip Eicher. Distraught at a future apart, the two decide their best hope is to reconcile the two families\u2026 but that means digging into the past to see what tore them apart. Will their love be enough to keep them together or will long-held secrets ruin their chance of happiness?This sounds awesome right well it is?? I can tell you it is very different from the other book I was reading at the same time. This is a great read for the beach. In fact, that is where I started reading this book sitting on the beach last Tuesday.I loved how Addie is such a strong female character being the only daughter in a huge family Addie works harder than anyone else in her family. She is expected to do the majority of the housework (i.e. cooking, cleaning, and tending the garden as well). She is not allowed to have any fun like her brothers. She has always been the obedient daughter so the fact that she stands up for love is awesome.Up until the time that Jonathan comes to town, Addie was sure that she would marry Philip. She always had a nagging doubt in her mind if he was really the one. Once she met Jonathan she knew that she could marry Philip and aids her aunt and uncle into persuading her parents. Will she or won\u2019t she, you will just have to read the book to see what happens?"}, {"userName": "\u269c\ufe0fTrea", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5223520-trea", "userReview": "[I loved how Addie and Jonathan decided to stand up for what they wanted and work for a peaceful solution to the problems between their families that were similar to the ones found in Romeo and Juliet.

This book can be read without reading the first book in the series. Addie is the only daughter in the Cramer family. She has always had to be responsible for so much because her mother can't handle doing many of the daily chores of an Amish family.While her brothers are aloud to do whatever during their rumspringa period, Addie's parents expect her to be good and do everything they ask of her. Her parents have even picked out who they want her to marry which is the bishops son. Addie is not sure that she has feelings for him, and doubts it more when the Mosier family moves back and she meets Jonathon. The Cramer and Mosier families have had a falling out in the past and they still do not get along. Addie and Jonathon try to figure out what the caused the families to have dislike each other so they could fix it. When Addie's parents find out she has been seeing Jonathon they get upset and do everything they can to stop the relationship. Will she follow what her parents want her to do or will she stand up for herself and go after the one she truly loves?I really enjoyed this book! It was interesting to see that Amish families don't always get along with other families like families outside of the Amish. From everything I have read it seems like they are such a tight community that things like this would not happen, but again they are human so it can happen to everyone. Addie was such a wonderful character, and I loved how she stood up for what she believed even though her parents tried to put a stop to it several times. I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series that Leslie Gould writes.

Phillip Eicher, the bishop's son. She just can not image marrying someone she does not love. Besides he is very boring and knows nothing about the real Addie and her feelings. She wants to marry someone who is actually interested in listening to her wants, needs and fears. So far the only man that seems to be interested in what she has to say is Johnathan Mosier.Johnathan Mosier is mesmerized at the first time he laid eyes on Addie Cramer and after talking to her he finds her to be humble, sincere and very attractive. The loyalty she shows toward her family and Amish community is from her heart and her trust in God.Like the Hatfields and the McCoys the Cramers and the Mosiers hold a grudge against each other and would never agree to a union between the two families.The author has written a wonderful story of a couple's heartache, a daughter's desire to honor her father and mother, reconciliation between friends, family and God. This story shows the readers how anger and harboring a grudge can harden one's heart and distant him from God.Addie's father seemed to favor his son's over his daughters, being more interested in what a marriage union for his daughter would bring to him and his family rather than how his daughter felt about the man her father had chosen for her to marry.I highly recommend this book.I rated this book a 5 out of 5.Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book from Baker Publishing/Bethany House for review.
