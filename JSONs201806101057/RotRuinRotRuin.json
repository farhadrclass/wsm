Zombies iz people too. So they should be treated with respect, yo. (more about this later) 2. Books containing zombies can be really irritating and boring. You see, I didn't know this was a possibility. I mean, it's zombies we're talking about here. How could zombies be boring? Turns out all you need to do is add a lame teenage romance and BAM! What really matters (ZOMBIES!) gets shoved onto the backburner in favor of the not-so-important (love story??? Who invited that guy? Alright, I'm out!). It needs to be said: if I wanted a romance novel I'd waste my time reading the likes of Nicholas Sparks. And that would never happen. Ever. Besides, I picked up a zombie book because I wanted to read a zombie story. Horror, Violence, Decapitations--oh my! Maberry's story has these things, but not enough to hold my interest. Most of the time we're being preached to by Tom Imura, Benny's older brother. See Tom Imura is a zombie slayer for hire. One of the best. You'd think a katana-wielding slayer extraordinaire would liven things up a bit. But no. No, he doesn't. He just waxes philosophical about how zombies are people too. The treating-zombies-with-respect-by-not-killing-them-unless-you-have-to thing? Ruined this book. Basically the argument defending this school of thought goes a little like this: Tom Imura: Pretend you're at a loved one's funeral and suddenly someone you don't know shows up and like defecates on your loved one's corpse. Wouldn't that anger you? Wouldn't that be disrespectful to your loved one and everyone who ever cared about them?Me: HECK YEAH! Let me at that disgusting jerk!Tom Imura: These zombies are other people's loved ones. Me: I totally agree. So sad. :( Go on. Tom Imura: Okay, so when you go around decapitating random zombies who are in no way bothering you you're pretty much doing the same thing as that filthy stranger that took a massive dump on your love one's corpse. Me:...Tom Imura: So basically you should just leave all those walking corpses--you know, the ones that totally want to eat your face and make you a zombie--alone. Because if you don't that's the same is defecating on a dead body. Or something. Me: *laughing hysterically* er...what??? I fail to see the connection. Your analogy is shoddy at best.Tom Imura: No really, think about it. Zombies have feelings too, as do their loved ones who may or may not be alive after the zombie apocalypse happens. Just leave all those innocent flesh-eating zombies alone, k. Promise? Unless, of course, a family member of a specific zombie hires you to hunt down said zombie for the sole purpose of decapitating them. Me: Uhhhh...no. If a zombie apocalypse happens I'm going to decapitate EVERY ZOMBIE I SEE. Wanna know why? Because I'm thoughtful. See, if I'm ever unfortunate enough to become a zombie I hope someone would be thoughtful enough to decapitate me and burn my remains to ash. As far as I'm concerned it would be incredibly disrespectful to do otherwise. I certainly don't want to walk the earth for an indefinite amount of time, rotting away and eating other people. What if I end up being one of those naked zombies? No one wants to be a naked zombie. I'd rather be dead dead then be a naked zombie, or a zombie of any sort for that matter. Also? Zombies carry disease. A freaking plague. Why wouldn't I want to stop that from spreading?I have zero desire to finish Rot & Ruin despite the fact I've got only 25 pages to go. Like I said earlier, there is a laaaaaame teenage romance that pretty much hijacks the plot. I probably would just bite the bullet and finish the book if I hadn't had to force myself to get this far. So no, I can't do it Cap'n.Jonathan Maberry is totally going be among the first to die when zombies attack.

Except for an occasional intellectual disagreements on ethics, morality, religion or politics we're pretty close. However, he can sometimes be a naive pain-in-the-butt.

CALL NOW for 250,000 extra zombies FREE for the price of 6,837,452,001!Rot & Ruin is a great first installment in a zombie dystopian future about a boy named Benny and his older, exasperated brother Tom. This book is well written. Benny is a great character and his friends Chong, Morgie and Nix are good for a chuckle.Tom, his dashing, debonair brother is lovable and... well, kind of hot really. Trying to deal with Benny as a fifteen year old and regular pain-in-the-ass and build some kind of relationship between the two of them, he drags Benny out of their safe town and into the 'Rot & Ruin'. Benny's adventures there lead him to new insight into human nature and zombie nature. When things turn bad for his girlcrush, Nix, (\"Oh no!\" Benny says, \"Don't tell people I have a crush on her! It's embarrassing and I might get cooties!\") Benny has some quick growing up to do.I really liked this story. It was such a refreshing difference in both the genre and in terms of the books I've been reading lately. The big romance in this book is not really between Benny and Nix or Benny and Lilah. It's a bromance between Benny and his brother Tom as they come together to heal their relationship and bring their small family back together.The story is packed with action, adventure, zombies, gore and violence. That's why we read it, right? But it's also filled with loving, tender moments between the two brothers as they learn and discover new things about each other. Nix and Lilah, the two girls in this story, are kick-arse and I give Maberry full credit and appreciation for developing two complex, intelligent and capable characters that totally own this book. From Nix who is strong and thoughtful, resourceful and compassionate, to Lilah who is cold, intelligent, capable, resourceful and dangerous. I want to see more women like this in fiction.All up, this book is a fun, wonderful read. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I can't wait to read more from Jonathan Maberry! Oh, and if you call now, I'll add in ANOTHER 250,000 zombies to that offer. 555-ZOMBIE-YEY-111.

I so am. BRING ITI'm just kidding. When there is a zombie apocalypse (no, not if), I'm about 98% sure I would not survive. I would be like those chicks in horror movies who get killed off in the opening credits. But there is the 2% I do survive initially, and then after that, I have a plan. I am skilled in no way shape or form. I hate the wilderness and physical activity. I am not a quick thinker and I panic under pressure. So basically, I am screwed unless I find Tom Imura. Tom Imura was one of the main reasons I enjoyed this book. He is basically a calm, sexy zombie-slaying Samurai. My plan is to marry him. I know, I know. How Mary-Suish of me. Well STFU, in retrospect this is for the good of America. This way we can have lots of half-Japanese zombie-killing offspring, and God knows the world needs more of those. Benny, the MC, is not as good as Tom. He is like a non-sexy, less-Asian bratty version of him. In the beginning of the novel, he was close to insufferable and I wanted to stab him with a katana (This book taught me Japanese!). Think of him as Harry Potter a la Book 5. But he did show growth and development and yada yada yada and by the end of the book he actually resembled a likable human being. But still not as awesome as Tom. I liked this book, but it was nothing close to fantastic for me. Despite the heavy themes, I was never emotionally invested in it. I disliked the writing, and even though the characters are developed, I never felt an attachment to them. This is entirely personal, however, and thats why I won't make too big of a stink about it. It was a good zombie book. Not all about the braaaaaiiiiinzzzz. Zombies are people too. Albeit, dead ones.

And the books are coming fast and furious, especially in the YA area. Some are good, some are awful, and some are outstanding. Jonathan Maberry\u2019s Rot and Ruin falls somewhere just shy of outstanding. It reeks of EPIC WIN. So yeah, I love this book and before I go all fangirl over Tom Imura and squee my head off let me highlight why you should start this series:1) It is very well-written -- that\u2019s not always a given, even from talented authors -- see my review of David Moody\u2019s Autumn: The City. Moody is the man, but even he can write a zombie novel that sucks. Maberry has already established his reputation in the horror genre (his Ghost Road Blues snagged him a Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel). This is his YA debut and I\u2019m impressed to say the least. 2) It is a highly charged, emotional story where some heavy shit goes down and you really fucking care who it\u2019s happening to. This comes back to the all-important character development. I don\u2019t scare if I don\u2019t care, and I cared plenty here (even about the zombies!!!) Through the eyes of 15 yr old Benny Imura, we come to understand that zombies are not just mindless monsters out to gouge and consume humans. We see the tragedy of what they\u2019ve become. Benny\u2019s older brother Tom forces him to confront who they used to be: Look at that woman. She was, what? Eighteen years old when she died. Might have been pretty. Those rags she\u2019s wearing might have been a waitress\u2019s uniform once\u2026.She had people at home who loved her\u2026.People who worried when she was late getting home. So the zombies are not just plot devices or mere window dressing here; they serve a real purpose and are an important part of the story. 3) It\u2019s a fascinating examination of what fear does to people. Just imagine a world that survives an actual zombie apocalypse. As groups of survivors ban together in fenced enclaves to try and eke out a semi-normal existence, who will these people become? How will they interact with each other, with the world that\u2019s left to them? I know it\u2019s a personal bias of mine, but I figure a zombie novel hasn\u2019t done its job if it doesn\u2019t convincingly show that humans can be the real monsters. Maberry hits that out of the park and I want to smooch him for it. They held each other and wept as the night closed its fist around their tiny shelter, and the world below them seethed with killers both living and dead. 4) Tom Imura \u2013 squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been this excited over a character from a book and reading as much YA as I do, most male protagonists are still battling hormones and attitude. But not Tom. Tom is in his 30s. He is a survivor. He is a specialist. He has been forged in battle and now is as strong and unbending as his katana - (no, not that! ... the Japanese long sword he uses). In a world that's been plunged into Hell and lived to tell about it Tom has retained his humanity. He is deep and soulful and will kick your ass in 2 seconds flat. He\u2019s a mix of Master Li Mu Bai from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Morpheus from The Matrix, and my beloved Dean Winchester from Supernatural. How could a girl NOT fall in love? I was going to put my sober, hyper-critical hat on and give this four stars, but piss on that. For all the reasons described above and more, I'm happy to give this book five, fat fearsome stars."}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "Long overdue for this zombie fan, I am finally - finally - reading this series! As you can guess I've been hearing a lot about this award winning author, Jonathan Maberry, and although I'm only on book 2 at the moment, I can already see why it garnered so much popularity (and book 2 is even better so far!). This novel is set years after the zombies came, so it's not your run of the mill survival of the fittest story happening in the midst of an apocalypse, this one is about what happens after that. After society has somewhat survived. After people have been forced to learn to live with unrelenting fear. After everyone in power is out there shambling away, leaving control to whoever takes it. This is the post apocalypse, ladies and gentlemen, it's violent, it's merciless, and the only way to fight for what's right is to go and do it yourself! This is basically the gist of what this series is about. With that said, don't expect constant flesh eating action. We're after something that is much more cruel than zombies - the latter having more or less settled down on a now barely inhabited earth. They remain a constant threat for sure, and the fear is looming in the background at all times, but it's not a continuous bloodbath like your average zombie horror flick. Although we do get some intensely kick ass zombie scenes that will get your adrenaline pumping once or twice. Learning about these zombies, the world building as a whole, kept me engrossed as much as any action sequence. I loved all the theories behind the zombies themselves which, if explored further, has the potential to become very interesting. Plus the details we do have so far - how they act, what they can/can't do (how sometimes they do turn doorknobs, etc) - are so well thought up. Very realistic; very eerie. The main character, Benny, I admit, was not my favorite at the beginning. He came off as an annoying brat, and oblivious one time too many, but when he goes off into the Rot and Ruin with his brother - aka in the real world - he grows up fast. We see this teenage boy learn the horrors that lay beyond the fence, and, in turn, the change in behavior this elicits. It's impressive character growth. In the end he's still a teenager at heart and with harsh cracks in his soul, but he's a brave young man that I came to admire. As for Tom, he's the bigger, stronger, more intelligent big brother who plays a big role in this story. What I loved the most about him was how much of a survivor he was, while keeping his moral values in check - not always easy in this world! Plus he never gives up on his little brother regardless of Benny's grudge against him. There is one other character who comes into play who fascinated me from the start. I'm very curious to see where this character will lead us. Just the oddity of their mental/social development in itself is especially intriguing. One thing I didn't feel in this book was the romance. Benny kept saying that he didn't feel \"that way\" about Nix, then a romance sprouts out of nowhere between them, lacking both buildup and emotional connection. You can't even blame it on a bond built from surviving together through extreme life and death situations because they're apart most of the book, until they're suddenly making out. I just didn't understand where it came from. I can already say that Rot and Ruin is only just the beginning of what promises to be an excellent, hectic series. Like all great zombie stories, it' a very character oriented, well built world filled with villains who are even worse than the flesh eating monsters who started it all!--For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9740056-kyle", "userReview": "WOW!

Benny and his brother Tom, Benny's girlfriend but \"not the girlfriend,\" Nix. There is her competition, the Wild Girl. Finally, there are Benny's heroes Charlie Pink-eye and the Hammer.

I looked forward to when I could pick the book up and read for a few minutes and hated to put it down. I became completed invested in Benny and his life.\nUnlike so many other series I've read recently, this was a complete story and not a cliff-hanger that makes you read the next book to see how it ends.

So passe, so early century, so urban fiction--so yawn for so many people. The genre is erroneously underrated; the best zombie and apocalypse fiction is about wrestling with humanity, ethics and survival, with some hair-raising action to leaven the philosophy. At worst, they're Cracker Jacks, caramel popcorn fun with a prize at the end. I love me some apocalypse fiction, and when Trudi recommended this series, I knew I had to give it a go.It opens in a small town of 28 thousand, with fifteen year-old Benny and his best friend Lou Chong forced to look for jobs, the bane of countless teenagers during countless summers. Only, if they don't find a job, food rations will be decreased by half, and we all know how teens like to eat. Benny lives with his half-brother Tom in a gated community, only this particularly community is gated to keep the zombies out. Benny has been carrying a grudge against Tom since the day of the Fall, fourteen years ago. He has a memory of Tom carrying him, racing away from the arms of his mom and leaving her to their father, who was already a zombie. Since then, Tom has spent years raising and protecting him, now working as a zombie-quieter. Benny truly doesn't understand his brother's expertise and philosophy, instead admiring the town bounty-hunter thugs who brag about number of kills and scavenged riches. To absolutely no one's surprise, Benny fails as all the jobs he tries and resigns himself to apprenticing with Tom. Tom takes him outside the fence, and Benny finds many of his beliefs and emotions challenged. They return to town, more stuff happens, and Benny has to do some fast growing up as they race against time to save ---The expositional process of going through different jobs is a novel and clever one, introducing the reader to various roles and norms within the community. The locksmiths repair locks so people can be locked in at night (in case they die of natural causes), and erosion artists act like police sketch artists for those missing family and friends. There isn't too much that is unique in the town setting or in society's reaction to the Fall, except for a religious faction that blames the zombies on technology. Religion plays another role outside the fence when Benny meets the zombie sympathizers. Mentality and technology have an 1800s Western feel, with bounty hunters and traders being the few willing to set foot outside of town.I lacked patience for early Benny; he's such a teenager, but of course, that's so he can grow exponentially by the book's finish. Characterization was done well; developed so that we had a feel for their complexities and motivations. Teenage dialogue, slacking and angst was believable. Zombies were standard for the genre. Writing was competent, with enough variety in structure and word choice to remain interesting, even if it didn't lead me to marvel over its beauty. There's a twisty ending, one part that we could see coming, another twist we couldn't, and it lends an emotional gravity to the book.Three and a half stars on the GR scale of enjoyment, rounding up because 1) I feel like it, and 2) I recognize my enjoyment in the first part was slightly compromised by the idiot naive teen angle that left me wanting to slap Benny. But that's me and teenagers, and probably a mark of how well Maberry creates characters."}, {"userName": "Shelby *trains flying monkeys*", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys", "userReview": "The ratings from my friends on this book are all over the place. Some loved it-some hated it. I almost took it back to the library without reading it because of that. Glad I gave it a go.Benny is a typical teenager in the beginning of this book. I didn't like his smart little butt and spent most of the time wanting to smack some sense into his head. Honestly, he kind reminds me of Carl from the Walking Dead. I couldn't stand that kid in the beginning of the series and half the time now I want to knock him one. He has started to come into his own now though and sometimes I see a spark of what he could become. \nBenny has to find a job or his food rations will be cut. (They live in a town that everyone has to have a job in order to eat) He goes through several jobs just slacking off hoping to find something easy to do. He finally ends up going out into the \"Ruin\" with his older brother Tom as an apprentice to bounty hunting zombies. Tom is half asian and badass with a sword. (He kinda reminds me of Glenn from Walking dead) He is thought of by his brother as a coward and no where as cool as the other bounty hunters that brag about their kills. \nOut in the Ruin this book came alive for me. I flipping loved it. There are always questions in this type of story about who the bad guys are? Is it the living? Who want power? Is it the zoms?

Tales of those first, terrible days when the horror of the outbreak strikes home. Rot and Ruin, in a pleasant surprise, breaks the mold on zombie stories. It picks up the story fifteen or so years after that first night. The initial chaos is gone. Humanity has figured out how to deal with the undead. They are slow. They are stupid. They are clumsy. While still a terrible threat, they are manageable.It is in this setting that the story of Benny Imura unfolds. Benny is a fifteen year old kid who is trying to find his place in the fenced in town of Mountainside. Like all kids, at fifteen he must find gainful employment or his rations will be cut. Benny bounces from one to the other before discovering that he has no other alternative than to apprentice with his brother, Tom. Benny can't stand his brother because all he remembers is that his brother ran with him, leaving his mother to his already zombified father.Tom is a bit of a bounty hunter. A man who brings closure to families by putting their undead loved ones to rest. And this is where the author separates himself from the other zombie apocalypse books out there. Tom teaches his brother that the zombies are more than the shambling undead. They were people once. They had lives and hopes and dreams. They had families. Tom humanizes the undead. And it is effective. Because they are so slow and so stupid and so clumsy, I felt sorry for them. They have no chance against humans who know what they are doing.Folded over this whole story is a mystery - the mystery of the Lost Girl. On First Night, one of the residents of Mountainside helped a little girl and her sister escape the undead. Benny catches wind of the story and begins digging into it. It turns out that his brother has seen and even spoken to the Lost Girl. Who is she? Why won't she come into town? and why is she killing men? This mystery and the story of the Lost Girl set this book apart. Yes, the living are the real enemy and the undead are simply a danger to be endured - like a storm - but Rot and Ruin takes a new turn on this overdone story line. The story is the mystery - not the overdone story line.In the end, just a great story - a great story for kids or adults. Four and a half stars rounded down to four. There were a few niggling things that detracted from the whole for me. First, the story started slowly. I did not truly immerse myself into the story until maybe a third of the way in. Next, there were more than a couple of points where I just said \"come on!\" to myself. There is no way that a certain character wielding a sword could survive certain things. These negatives, however, shouldn't detract from what is a pretty darn good little story. Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "AH", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255548-ah", "userReview": "Is the zombie apocalypse close at hand?

I don\u2019t go out of my way to read about zombies, or watch *shudder* zombie movies. I get squeamish at the sight of blood and gore.Rot & Ruin is a great read. Aimed at the young adult market, I can certainly see my 14 year old son getting a kick out of this book. I loved its underlying theme: zombies are just like people except they\u2019re dead (and they may want to bite you). I despaired at the world of Rot & Ruin, a world of abandoned technology and zombies. Rot & Ruin is the story of Benny Imura and his legendary brother Tommy. Benny barely remembers First Night, the night the zombies took over. Benny is just your average 15 year old boy who must find a job in order to keep receiving his food rations. The job market in the zombie post apocalypse sucks, probably worse than today\u2019s job market. Benny tries some truly horrid jobs, but never lasts. He finally takes the last possible job \u2013 his brother\u2019s apprentice. Tommy is a heroic zombie hunter and well known throughout their world. I really liked how Benny\u2019s view of Tommy changes significantly during the book and how Tommy allows this change of attitude little by little. I loved how Benny is portrayed as just a regular teenager, with teenage angst and issues. Benny\u2019s friends are also very entertaining. I loved Morgie and Chong and enjoyed reading about their job hunting woes. Nix was another interesting character and I loved how all the boys wanted to date her. I was intrigued by the Lost Girl Lilah. For a girl who grew up on her own, she was fierce, lethal and very resourceful. The bad guys in this book are especially heinous. Charlie Pink-Eye and Motor City Hammer are very unscrupulous zombie hunters. I really enjoyed this book and I am looking forward to the next installment of Benny and Tommy Imura\u2019s story.

I also enjoyed that he didn't sugar-coat anything; there's lots of gory parts in this book.I liked the setting, the philosophical parts, the characters, and the plot ... so that's a win. Only thing I can nitpick is how the heroes kept falling for the villains traps, but, I kind of liked that the heroes didn't just run through the gauntlet of this story with no obstacles in the way. Another nitpick is the blatant foreshadowing that SOMETHING BAD IS GOING TO HAPPEN ... but it's not like I haven't seen that before (kind of reminds me of Goosebumps books, to be honest.) I never really felt like I was being hit over the head with a foreshadowing hammer over and over though. It's not subtle, no, but it does make you want to read on to see what's going to happen next.This is seriously a great start and honestly I'm already reading the next book and this is the perfect time of year to start this sort of book."}, {"userName": "Lou", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3699303-lou", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Lisa Mandina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1065635-lisa-mandina", "userReview": "I had been wanting to read this book for a long time. The whole zombie book trend has really hooked me I think. And this book did not disappoint. In fact, you'll notice I gave it 5 stars, and lately, even books that have been really good have only gotten a 4 from me. But I felt this was really different, had something new. Not sure exactly what I'd say was \"new\", but I did really enjoy this. I didn't start out with the description of the book thinking that it would be this good though. This is a boy main character, and in this future world, when you reach a certain age, you must get a job or you don't get as many rations. In a way, the ration part, reminds me a bit of The Dead-Tossed Waves. Because one of the characters in that lost his sister because he was looking to get her money to live on by joining an army. And it was a zombie book. But going on, Rot & Ruin started out with the main character hitting the age and going to look for a job. The different jobs that were available were pretty interesting. Looking at pictures of lost loved ones and trying to predict how they would now look as a zombie. Checking the fences around the town to make sure they were strong enough to keep the zombies out. Working in a factory to squeeze the \"juice\" out of the dead zombies to make \"cadaverine\", a scent used for those who went out to hunt the zombies. Staying in the lookout towers to keep an eye on the zombies, the job his friend Chong gets. And finally, the job his brother has, zombie hunter. After either not being qualified for some of the jobs, or not wanting the others, Benny ends up working with his brother Tom. Benny does not respect his brother. His first memory is of his mother handing him to his brother, and telling him to run as his father was attacking them as a zombie. And Benny cannot believe his brother left his mother to die. So now Benny cannot believe the big tough reputation his brother has as a zombie killer.I thought this would be just a book about a boy learning how to hunt zombies and coming to respect his brother through that. But it was more. Learning to realize that the zombies weren't evil, they were just a disease that had taken over the bodies. The main story being that just normal people were really the ones that could be evil. The family stories, the \"First Night\" stories, I just felt all of it was really good. I can't wait to read the 2nd book in the series. Of course it will have to wait till I finish reading the books for Gateway nominee list, but it will be probably in December."}, {"userName": "Janina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3455554-janina", "userReview": "Rot & Ruin was the first zombie book I ever read and judging by how much I liked it, I think it won't be the last (recommendations are welcome; I'm not exactly an expert). I would categorize it as middle grade, though, so if you're looking for a 'hard-core' ;) zombie book, you might want to look elsewhere.First of all, I really like the makeup of this book: We have an eye-catching \u2013 and slightly creepy cover \u2013 and then on the inside we have some 'zombie-cards' (the kids in the story collect them) of famous people and a 'zombified' author portrait. Laughed out loud at some of this stuff. And the best: The book's interior \u2013 the story \u2013 can actually keep up with that. Too many other books with awesome covers disappointed lately.About the story: The US in the near future: most of the country has been deserted; people live together in small towns behind huge fences, shielding themselves against millions of zombies. Benny Imura lives in Mountainside, together with his half brother Tom, a zombie hunter, after his parents were killed and resurrected as zombies on First Night \u2013 the night the dead began to rise and threw the whole world into chaos. Although he believes his older brother to be a coward and their relationship isn't exactly a good one, Benny joins the 'family business' and begins to hunt zombies together with Tom. Soon he has to learn that the dead aren't the real evil out there.Despite the fact that this novel is clearly plot driven and includes a fair amount of violence and gore, it also has its quiet moments and there were even a few scenes that made me get a little teary-eyed. This novel is about so much more than 'going out killing zombies' \u2013 it focuses just as strongly on relationships of all kinds. At the centre of attention is Benny\u2019s development after his first trip out into the Ruin: to be honest, he comes across as quite a pain-in-the-ass in the beginning, though he clearly has a good heart. But when his friend Nix is in danger, he is forced to mature quickly, sheds his know-it-all attitude towards his older brother and does everything possible to help those close to him.I loved how the relationship between Benny and Tom developed, how Benny slowly began to realise what was behind his brother's mask of indifference and started to admire the way he did his job. Their relationship is what keeps this story going. The occasional banter between them was fun, and their 'bonding moments' were moving.Also, hats off to Jonathan Maberry for writing two female characters who clearly own this story. Both of the girls are resourceful and strong in their own way, they don't need any rescuing and are perfectly able to make \u2013 and defend \u2013 their own choices. I would really like to see more girls of this type in all genres. And most of all, I appreciated that all these characters dealt with traumatic experiences as I would expect real people to do. They suffered and didn\u2019t move on quickly after a few moments of sadness and anger. They carried those experiences with them, and they have changed their ways of behaviour and altered their personalities.Although this novel clearly has its own ending and could be read as a stand-alone (no mean cliff-hanger here), there clearly is the potential for a sequel. Will be checking out Dust and Decay (which is just a great title, by the way)!"}, {"userName": "Mariel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647547-mariel", "userReview": "I don't really have anything new to add about Rot & Ruin other than throwing in my voice to chime with the naysayers in a bored \"Nay!\" I may even be lip synching.

Preferrably, I enjoy watching movies or playing video games with zombies in it because of the thrill and jump scares. Rot & Ruin is a pleasant surprise. This book has been sitting on my shelves for years and I made a right decision picking it up. It's a refreshing and meaningful dystopia story. It's not just about survival and killing the living dead as Jonathan Maberry digs deeper than that.Our protagonist is a 15 year old boy, Benny Imura . At first he gets on my nerves because he's whiny, immature and sarcastic. He lives with his older brother, Tom Imura. He and Tom aren't close and somewhat mad at him for not saving their parents' lives during the first outbreak. Tom is a bounty/zombie hunter and since Benny couldn't find a job he wants, he introduced him to their family business. Tom is a strong, humble and compassionate man who values humanity. Unlike other bounty hunters, he doesn't blast off zombie brains or kill them in a grotesque manner. He's a Grim Reaper but a gentle one. He showed Benny how he ends the zombies, paying respects in behalf of his clients and talked sense in him. He made him realize that zombies were once humans and should be respected too. Seriously, I love Tom Imura! HANDS. DOWN. After his exposure beyond the fence filled with zombies, Benny improved a lot. He becomes open-minded and more mature. In the end, I grew to love him just like Tom (but I love Tom more haha!). I'm glad the Imura brothers worked out their issues and I'm looking forward reading their upcoming journey."}, {"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3813315-lucy", "userReview": "To say I am a fan of zombie books and films would be putting it mildly. As a small child in church, I'd sit on the kneeler and watch people going up for communion and imagine who I would want in my post-zombie village.Another fact you should know: I read half of Jonathan Maberry's Patient Zero and I just wasn't into it. I kept putting it down and stopped picking it up, not because it was bad, but because I didn't really care about what happened next. I remember finding the dialogue awkward and unnatural, especially when the author was going through FBI measures, but I can't say for sure without a re-read. However, Rot & Ruin, on the other hand, I read in a single day.Writing caliber wasn't my problem with Maberry's first novel. He does write well. He has a good pace and rhythm, makes excellent word choices and, at least in Rot & Ruin, his dialogue rarely felt stilted or false. He has a lot of talent and I can see he's still polishing it into something particularly remarkable. Rot & Ruin captivated me so much I might even give Patient Zero another shot, although I'll have to buy a second copy since I gave away my first. I will, however, be keeping my copy of Rot & Ruin.The story was pretty original, the lead character's voice strong and clear, and the minor characters were charming. I'm a fan of Sarah Rees Brennan's Demon Lexicon because in a sea of YA fiction about unhealthy supernatural romance Brennan wrote about a family, about love and sacrifice. Rot & Ruin had similar wonderful markers. The important relationship was between the two brothers, while the rest of the story circled around them in perfectly timed movements.Some zombie novels suffer from having the zombies be a distant, obscure part of the universe that you rarely see. Other zombie novels are annoying, non-stop action with little character development. Rot & Ruin had an excellent balance of both along with some original plot lines and world building. The only turn off was the elder brother, Tom, went over the top with the lectures way too often. It was when my attention was most likely to stray. I'd recommend the book for anyone ages 12 and up. Some violence would make me hesitate over handing it to anyone younger."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1471666-stephanie", "userReview": "Loved this! It was zombie killers a la Clint Eastwood. There was a western flavor to this that I really liked.Benny Imura is fifteen years old and looking for a job. His older brother Tom is a bounty hunter but Benny can't stand the idea of working with him because Tom is a coward. What kind of \"man\" would run away from his parents and not try to save them from the zombie horde? But that's just what Tom did, taking his infant brother Benny with him.Now, fourteen years later, they live in the relative safety of Mountainside but Benny is far from happy especially because town law says that at fifteen his food rations are to be cut off unless he can find a job. Jobs being hard to come by, Benny's hand is forced and he agrees to become Tom's apprentice. For Benny's first day on the job Tom takes him out into the \"Rot & Ruin\", the world beyond the high fences of Mountainside. This is where Tom does his work. His bounties are zombies and his clients are the family members of these former humans. He calls himself a \"Closure Specialist\", giving relief to these poor zombies and their families by quieting them for good. But there are other bounty hunters out there in the Rot & Ruin, ones with a far less noble purpose. When Benny comes face to face with what they are up to he is horrified. But this knowledge also brings Benny and his friends and familiy into danger and circumstances bring him out in the Rot & Ruin to try to stop these evil bounty hunters.Wow, this was a fun a book!

Moments in which everything they are and everything they may possibly become balance on a single decision. Life and death, hope and despair, victory and failure teeter precariously on the decision made at that moment. These are moments ungoverned by happenstance, untroubled by luck. These are the moments in which a person earns the right to live, or not.Inspiring? Moving? Emotional? These are just some of the words I didn't expect to express reading a book about Zombies, and yet it's exactly what I found.Riot & Ruin starts the story off with a boy named Benny Imura who's 15th birthday looms near. This means he has to find a job or he'll loss his food rations. He doesn't want to work with his brother,Tom, the oh-so famous bounty hunter, but with very little choice Benny agrees to be Tom's apprentice.Watch and learn as Benny gets the wake-up call of his life and gets a taste of what his world is real all about as well as learns who his brother real is, as Tom shows him that there are far more meaner and crueler monsters out there then the deformed infested Zombie's that has changed there lives...To be perfectly honest I had absolutely no intentions to even read this book. For one, I'm not a big fan of Zombie genre and for another, that cover, well, scares the hell of me. But I saw this book at my store and thumbed through it, a few quotes caught my eye, my curiosity peeked I took a chance. I am so glad I did. Rot & Ruin is probably the best Zombie book I have ever read.True to form this is a book filled with the undead Zombies that seek flesh for there flavor but I didn't find it overly graphic or gruesome. I think maybe because it wasn't overpowering with them, more like around them. There were some cringe worthy moments though that I thought were pretty wicked.The storyline really surprised me since it's more plot driven then anything else and it was so much more to it then see-zombie, kill-zombie, run-zombie, which I'm ashamed to admit is what I was actually expecting.Jonathan Maberry inspires the concept of life and death with right and wrongs by putting his characters through a journey of self discovery, survival and growth.The writing is strong and well crafted, walking us through memories of First Night, the tiny town of Mountainside and over the fence to the Rot & Ruins giving us a clear cut path to the people infected, affected, and the stories that are burned into there very souls.The Imura brothers, Tom and Benny, are fantastic character that had me captivated through out the entire book.Benny is naive and young but he has a good heart and when leaded in the right directions shows maturity, courage and strength. I was very proud of him.Tom? I love Tom. He's the kind of guy that has your back and he'd be my first pick if I was every faced with a bunch of the undead coming at me. His 101-Yoda-like teachings is impressive and thought provoking. He's kick ass, compassionate, cleaver and has some great wit.I don't want to say to much about the actual plot since I want others to experience it first hand, but bottom line, I just loved this book! It has some great brotherly moments that made me cry, all the characters are well developed, even the bad guys, and the writing is completely hypnotizing.

KILL THEM BEFORE YOU'RE BITTEN!!!Nix is such a waste of a character, she's just a love interest! Yes, the book tries to make her a badass, but when she's kidnapped (I warned about the spoilers, so...), do you know how she manages to get away? She kicks one of her kidnappers in the private parts and runs. Wow. What a big escape!!! Also, she is considered such a \"tough chick\" (in the words of Benny), but in reality she is a damsel in distress who needs to be rescued by the big manly man that is Benny for THREE TIMES!!! I think, at least. I was too angry and annoyed to pay attention to her.Why romance is necessary in a book about zombies? Benny is barely 15, make that happen in the sequel or something, when we actually start to care about the characters. And so many love triangles!
