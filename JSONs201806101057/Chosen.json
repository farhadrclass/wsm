Unfortunately by the time I got past the first 1/3 of the book I just simply didn't have my heart into it. The characters are SOOOO unlikeable. I didn't like, or sympathize with any of them, except Heather, a very minor character who is giving her 2nd child up for adoption because she loves BOTH her children too much to ever have to see them go without simple things like medication, and clothing because she can't afford it. The rest of the characters are written to be just awful people. Francie McAdoo is probably the worst offender, but I have a hard time that any person who has waited years to adopt, after failing to conceive, would be so concerned that their baby was exposed to nicotine in the womb. It's not crack, it's cigarettes, and the book already established that it was a large baby, so the low birth weight issue most people are concerned about with smoking, wasn't an issue. Then there is the ending of this book. Usually I'm all for happy endings. This one, while happy was just plain out unrealistic. There was absolutely no way that every one of those characters could have a happy ending with the way they set themselves up, and yet they did. I was just so disappointed in this book after the first third that I can't in all honesty recommend it to anyone else."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2637089-danielle", "userReview": "Chosen was one of those stories that gets under your skin. Having dealt with my share of infertility problems, not only personally but within my own family, it was heartbreaking to read of the struggles of both the adoptive parents and birth mothers in this story. Both Heather and Penny, birth mothers, seek to find consolation in the hopes that they are doing the \u201cright thing.\u201d Although, they aren\u2019t sure, even months after their babies have been given to new homes and parents. On the other hand, the adoptive parents yearning for an infant of their own to comfort and care for is equally heart wrenching; their constant waiting with subsequent devastation at a changed decision. Both sides of the coin have their own burdens and suffering, but equally, joy when a resolution is happily met.There were instances in this book when I felt myself physically cringe. In one scene a mother physically strikes an infant repeatedly. The act is minute in comparison to the length of the book, only a couple of sentences, but even now \u2013 days after having completed it the scene still comes to mind. It was horrifying, but incredibly real. The couple with the infant not only were quite young, but they lived in a terrifying part of town, surrounded by criminals. The father, Jason, is crude and repulsive, but still filled with an overwhelming love for Penny, his girlfriend. Were it not for these characters, no matter how uncomfortable they often made me feel, the story would be completely different. Less compelling.It\u2019s the struggle that each couple and individual goes through that make the book what it is. Especially Chloe, the heart of the situation \u2013 if you will, who feels she\u2019s doing everything with the best interests off all in mind. At the beginning of the journey they each seem so firm, so unmovable in their decisions, but throughout the course of the book they learn there is often more than one way to look at the outcome that results. In the end it\u2019s what their heart desires that takes them down the path they each go, some ending in completely different places they thought were possible.Overall, I really enjoyed Chosen. I\u2019m not entirely sure it falls firmly in the \u201cChick Lit\u201d category, but I would definitely compare it to the likes of Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Weiner. If I had any difficulty with it besides what I\u2019ve already mentioned, it would be the number of points of view. With nearing on half dozen different characters speaking throughout the book, were it not for the beautiful writing of Chandra Hoffman I\u2019m not sure I could have followed. Even with that detail, I\u2019d still highly recommend Chosen."}, {"userName": "Laurel-Rain", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1402123-laurel-rain", "userReview": "In Portland, Oregon, the (fictional) Chosen Child adoption agency operates with a specific mission in mind: families can be created. To the social workers who work there, including Chloe Pinter who directs the domestic adoption program, the mission is one that almost supersedes everything else in their lives. Their hours are unpredictable, interrupting many moments of personal interaction. Chloe's relationship with her fianc\u00e9 Dan is precarious at times because of the demands of the job.But Chloe forges ahead, connecting birth parents to adoptive ones with a zeal that seemingly consumes her.In this tale about creating families, the alternating chapters focus on individual characters, from Chloe, to individual birth parents, and to a couple that once tried to adopt, but now has a birth child.Each exploration reveals the emotional drains as well as the eager anticipation of each character, whether that character is one waiting for an adoptive child or is a birth parent struggling with the pain of giving up a child. We come to empathize with the pain, the struggles, and finally the joy that comes when everyone achieves his/her goal.But the story does not end with the \"chosen family\" riding off into the sunset. We also see the regrets of the birth parents, the struggles of new parenthood for the adoptive ones, and even a case of postpartum depression that almost leads to disaster.Hoffman's portrayal of the birth/adoption process was realistic, delving into the flaws of all the characters with sensitivity. Social workers, as well as birth parents, are human and subject to errors in judgment. These insights added depth to \"Chosen: A Novel,\" which resulted in a five-star review from this reader."}, {"userName": "Natalie ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1167461-natalie", "userReview": "Awesome read!

While I have never thought too much about it, was pretty disgusted with the idea that people, who are involved in an adoption arrangement (whether as a birth mother or an adopting parent) are at the mercy of (or perhaps even willingly/actively contribute to) a system of profitability - that there are people in this world that think it is okay to excessively profit from these situations and have so jaded the process that adoption is losing its true meaning - while intending to be in the best interest of children, adoption has become yet another avenue for individuals to exploit intentions - another case of someone profiting from an action that was never intended to be profit based. Because the book did a great job of painting this picture of profit (Judith is just about the most detestable character), it did a horrible job of promoting adoption as a life option. But, then, I suppose that was not the intent of this novel. The focus of this novel seemed to be spotlighting the business aspect and it's impact on those involved. There was no warm fuzzy that shows the true child benefits of adoption. Because of this, I can't say that I loved this book - meaning that it didn't make me feel good and it didn't make me happy. I don't feel like I am a better person for having read it. I also, however, don't feel like I wasted my time. The book was well written, very dark, and brought to light an issue that I had never thought much about. So, yes....well written, good book. But not a feel good or even an enlightening story.

After you've read the last page, you contemplate the plot, the characters, and wish that you hadn't read the book so quickly. Chosen is one of those books.Chandra Hoffman takes the very delicate subject of adoption and tackles it head on. Through out the book the reader gets 4 POVs. Chloe Pinter is the social worker for the adoption agency, who has been struggling to find her place in the world and feels that she has found her place now that she is in Portland. Francie and John McAdoo are the high maintenance couple who is looking to adopt from Chloe's agency. Paul and Eva Nova had been trying for years to have a child and had decided on adoption when Eva suddenly becomes pregnant. Jason and Penny, the down on their luck couple, fresh out of jail, looking to put their son up for adoption.This is not a fairy tale story about adoption and the process that couples have to go through to be selected. All of the characters hit rough spots in the story line. Just when you think that things are gong to work themselves out, something else happens to the characters, keeping the book extremely interesting.The ending was not what I expected either. For a few moments, I was ticked that it ended the way it did. However, because Hoffman chooses such a different resolution rather than the cliche standard it works.

I am so excited to get the book! It looks very good!Update: I enjoyed this \"most of the time\". First, I like books that have a different plot or premis to them and this didn't disappoint. Not the same old read. Secondly, I liked the way that Hoffman \"grew\" her characters from page one through the end of the book. We met them, may have liked, disliked or felt sorrow for them... but as they developed as people and the characters grew to know themselves, my opinions continually changed too. One minute, I was mad at a character and the next, I felt a little sorry for them. Or on one page, I was so happy for a character, and the next page - I was feeling angry. Each character seemed to grow in the book and I was satisfied when I closed the book at the end of the night.However, I felt that there may have been too many \"main\" characters so it was hard to follow at times and I also felt that Claire, the focus character, was quite wishy washy a lot of the time.
