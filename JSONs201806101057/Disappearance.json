It is true that the pace is languid and that there is very little action. However there is a great deal going on beneath the surface; as there always is with Dabydeen. The influence of Naipaul is clear as is that of Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness; most of all though there is the influence of another Guyanese novelist Wilson Harris.The protagonist is a Guyanese engineer who comes to England to work on coastal defences on the south coast near Hastings. He stays in the village of Dunsmere with Mrs Rutherford. We move backward to his childhood and to his first engineering job in Guyana and then back to the present. Interestingly the particular stretch of coastline near Dunsmere is the same one where the protagonists of Rushdie\u2019s Satanic Verses also land. Mrs Rutherford is a sort of guide, not only to the village, but to the past and colonialism. She has lived in Africa and has some tribal masks, which play a role in their discussions about England and colonialism; her husband has left her (now possibly dead). There are two characters who play similar roles; both workmen on the coastal projects; Swami in Guyana and Christie, an Irishman, in England.The novel is packed with symbolism; the crumbling cliff; falling apart as the empire fell apart. The migrant condition is examined in the interplay with Mrs Rutherford on the very stretch of coastline so symbolic in British history (1066 and all that). Of course the engineer is battling the very same sea that he battled in Guyana. The landscape in England is symbolic and strange:\u201cI felt like some prehistoric bone in the Hastings museum which had suddenly stirred in its glass cabinet\u201dAlienation and identity are strong themes; the engineer tries to fit in rather than be himself; Mrs Rutherford points out he too is hidden behind a mask of subservience because of his desire to be accepted.The contrast between the two engineering projects is significant; the sea triumphs in Guyana. As the worker Swami points out the engineer has adopted a western approach and not taken into account local conditions and local gods. In England Christie says much the same thing to him. Although the scheme in England works, the local gods here are custom and money. The Engineer\u2019s mentor Prof Fenwick (who set up the job), he discovers (through Christie) is taking money and dragging the job out.The migrant experience is alien and unsettling, but changes the face of the landscape and indeed the structure of the land as the sea wall is completed.There are so many layers; the heart of darkness theme is also central and it is easy to get lost in all the levels of meaning. Actually an enjoyable and thought provoking read."}, {"userName": "K.D. Absolutely", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely", "userReview": "Losing oneself in a crowd or in chaos. I think this is the main theme of this book by African author David Dabydeen. Born in Guyana, he studied English at Cambridge. His five novels and three collections of poetry were awarded the Commonwealth Poetry Prize, the Quiller-Couch Prize and the Guyana Price, as well as being shortlisted for the John Llewelyn Rhys Prize, the Dublin Impac Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. Whew! I do not know any of those but Dabydeen surely deserves all of them because this book almost made as the Best African Novel for me.Almost because for the first 3/4 of the book, the plot is wonderfully told until the last quarter where Dabydeen seemed to have injected too many twists and revelations making his denouement felt contrived and rushed up. The first half of the book is basically about the main characters of the book, a young Guyanese engineer who comes to a coastal Kentish village as a part of a project to shore up its crumbling sea-defenses. There he meets Mr. & Mrs. Rutherford who are at odds with one another. Mrs. Rutherford, who loves to tend her flower bed, becomes the young man's constant companion. There is also Professor Fenwick who is suspected to be gay by some people. Then there is also the friend of the Rutherfords, Mr. Curtis who is rumored to be Mrs. Rutherford's lover. Lastly, there is Christie an Irish who also comes to live at the Rutherford's house to help maintain their house.These characters are described vividly in the first three quarters of the book. The storytelling is richly intertextual making references to the works of Conrad, Wilson Harris and V.S. Naipaul. At times, it was difficult to understand because the setting changed so very often mimicking probably what went on in Dabydeen's mind while writing the book. However, towards the middle part, everything started to settle down and the reading became easy as the plot thickened. It was a breeze from then on but like what I already mentioned, too many twists and revelations were put in the ending and everything became unbearably contrived.The mood of the novel is similar to Rabindarath Tagore's The Home and the World (4 stars) or Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche's Half of a Yellow Sun (4 stars). The only big difference is that the black character leaves his home country (Guyana) and goes to Britain. In these two books, the racial discrimination happens in the African country.If there is one thing I really like and it is enough for me to recommend this book to you, it is the Dabydeen's lyrical prose. He is first and foremost a poet and it shows in his writing here. It is always a joy to read a poet describing his surroundings especially if the setting is in a laid back coastal town in Britain or the exotic land of Africa. I liked this book!"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4705693-beth", "userReview": "\"Work, work, work, that's the doom of your people isn't it? Isn't that why the English shipped millions of you over to the Caribbean? So how come you don't hate them?\"\"I've not really considered it that way\u2026 I just don't\u2026\" I said, thinking of Professor Fenwick's influence on me, his conscientious tuition and dedication to duty. How could I hate such a man, whatever culture he belonged to? A single act of kindness on his part had the power to erase a whole history of crime. \"It's the future that matters,\" I continued, struggling to evolve a cogent answer, \"I'm me, not a mask or movement of history. I'm not black, I'm an engineer.\"\"That's silly,\" she continued immediately, \"you can't block yourself off from the past and sit daydreaming at the edge of the desert. That's why I had to go back with Jack, that's why I wanted him to find me even though I resented it. I walked away from the desert and returned to the English compound and began to fight. I really longed to be alone, colorless and invisible, but I couldn't escape being English, I couldn't escape being what I was. So I fought against myself. No more slushy reminiscences in the English Club about oak trees and cream teas back home. Of course the other women grew suspicious of me when I gave up bridge sessions and meetings to plan safari weekends. Jack made excuses for me, saying the heat had gone to my head, that I had become grumpy and solitary, but I didn't care. What mattered was secretly teaching the African children about our dinosaur culture, however deeply we tried to bury it and make neat furrows and tranquil gardens in the earth above. Do you know that the best histories of England are being written by black scholars nowadays? Do you? Probably some of those very children I taught who have now grown up.\" She snatched the glass from my hand and poured out more wine. I noticed the trace of froth at the corner of her mouth. She'd worked herself up into a passion. I began to appreciate the reason for Jack's absence. He had not abandoned her, he had run away! She was too formidable for him, so he fled. All his fantasies of blood and sex were nothing compared to the knowledge of horror she possessed and was determined to proclaim. \"You don't know much about our history or yours,\" she said, resuming her attack. \"Have you ever thought that the engineering you're versed in is all derived from us? That we've made you so whiter than white that whatever fear and hatred you should feel for us is covered over completely?\"I had no trouble finding a passage to quote in Disappearance. The hard part was choosing among the many that I post-it marked along the way as I was reading. David Dabydeen tells the tale of a Guyanese engineer of African descent visiting a rural coastal English town to work on a project to shore up collapsing cliffs against the forces of a powerful sea. He rooms at the home of an aging British woman whose husband is not around and whose whereabouts aren't entirely clear. She has spent a portion of her married life in Africa, and the engineer is profoundly unsettled by the artifacts on prominent display in her home which call to mind his ethnic heritage and by her expectations about who he is, based on his nationality and ethnicity. The book is about identity, colonialism and its effects on colonized and colonizer, about rationality vs. superstition and belief, about the relationship of the personal and the political, and about the ability of humankind to triumph over the power of the natural world. The engineer comes to like his host very much, but struggles to make sense of her. He is also struggling to understand himself and the philosophies that guide him personally and professionally. The story weaves in and out of the present, with Mrs. Rutherford and others in the village telling him of her past, and with the engineer recalling his own childhood and early career in Guyana. I liked this book, I really liked it, but wasn't blown away or enchanted. I think I was in my head rather than my heart for the most part, and the things it did with my head were not interesting or experimental or revealing enough to make up for my not being more emotionally involved. I definitely recommend the book, but there are others I'd tell you to get to first if you had to choose. Still, I'm glad I had time for this one, and I'm particularly glad for a quick and interesting read from the 1001 list from a country as small and under-represented in world literature as Guyana. Because I hate to have to leave out some interesting quotes, I'll close with another passage, this one from the narrator's memories of Guyana.  \"Repentance?\" I asked, startled by her mention of the word which haunted my boyhood. \"How do you mean?\" But she said nothing else, retreating into herself, into a space as cramped and suffocating as the village she had come from, a handful of homes in the pocket of bush on the banks of a river too dangerous to cross except by boats with engines. Its strong hidden currents frequently capsized the small canoes they paddled, sucking in a body and feeding it downstream to piranha. There seemed to be no way into the village and no way out except by hazarding one's life. Those born into the place were doomed to stay there, inheriting the wretched plots of clearing from their parents, existing on a diet of yams, plantains, wild fowl, and fish. She had managed to get out, only to be trapped in a canteen in the service of male students who wanted to force her into the tighter space of their lust. And yet the word \"repentance\" came from her mouth, so naturally, Alfred's big word which had signified to me the whole broadness of the sky in which God lived. \"So big,\" he had said, pointing to the sky before returning to the patch of cloth on his machine."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2341546-becky", "userReview": "Disappearance is the rather morose tale of a young engineer from Guyana who travels to the English coast to build a sea wall, and in turn discover something about the country that held his captive for so long, and the people who inhabit it. It's a good premise for a book, but I struggled to get on with the characters. The engineer builds a brief relationship with Mrs Rutherford, his landlady who spent time in after and suffered at the hands of her unfaithful husband. She however, is depicted in such a wooden fashion, and the engineer is so over earnest, that it's difficult to really feel for their stories. Indeed, Mrs Rutherford only really comes to life through the words of others, such as Christie the Irish labourer. The whole read felt a little stifled, a little detached, and so the carefully considered revelations stimulated little in the sense of emotion as I read them. Not one of the best novels, by a long way."}, {"userName": "Sonja", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12269522-sonja", "userReview": "This was extremely boring. It took me about two weeks to read, even though it's only 150 pages long. I usually just consume books in a matter of days, but this was really hard. I would have given up after the first 10 pages, if it had not been for my oral examination, which could possibly be concerning this book. I get the symbolism of an English empire that is falling apart and Mrs Rutherford as the faded beauty whom no one wants to talk to anymore, and even though this is described in an oddly beautiful way, the novel was still just plain boring. I fell alseep every other time I had finished ten pages."}, {"userName": "Katrina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2240622-katrina", "userReview": "I finished this yesterday. The book is the reported conversations of an migrant to England, working to save our sea defences and an elderly English woman who has an obssession with Africa and a mysterious past.I thought the novel worked well at the beginning and end but I got lost for a while in the middle. Not a gripping novel as nothing much actually happens, from the synopsis I was expecting an insight into England from an outsiders eyes, but the scope was limited to a tiny village and just two other characters."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert", "userReview": "To be honest I really am at crossroads with this book. On one hand I definitely can\u2019t say I disliked it but on the other hand \u2013 with the exception of one chapter and the last paragraph \u2013 I wasn\u2019t absorbed either. For a 156 page novel it also took a while for me to read, which I found strange. I just couldn\u2019t really engage myself.An unnamed Guyanese/African engineer moves to a coastline English village in order to build a breaker as the sea is slowly eating everything away and houses are collapsing. As this is a short-term project he moves in with Janet Rutherford, a woman who has a reputation amongst the townspeople. The engineer does discover that she does have a bit of a past and her lovers also reveal some things about her and the workplace where the engineer is stated.Really though the plot is superfluous , What Disappearance is really about is the notion of race amongst the British population. The engineer is clearly an outsider in England but due to his education does not fit in well with his own people either. However Mrs. Rutherford also has issues as the majority of the villagers hate her as she finds English culture boring but during her sojourn to Africa she couldn\u2019t really blend in and ended up teaching British history to African children. The third \u2018alien\u2019 character is the Irishman Christie who accentuates his Irishness as a sign of individuality and although he is accepted by the villagers, he ends up going slightly mad due to this.By the end of the novel all characters live on and survive, which is the only solution really.I already gave my views in the first paragraph so I won\u2019t go into them again but I do feel that there is something a bit lacking \u2013 does anyone share this view??"}, {"userName": "Philip Lane", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4877887-philip-lane", "userReview": "Very enjoyable short novel about 'Britishness' as seen by a visitor to England. It looks to the past and to the future and gets quite philosophical at times which really hit the spot as far as I am concerned. The basic story of an engineer from Guyana overseeing works on coastal protection I found less accessible - being a bit technical for me but also quite symbolic for the idea of the erosion of national identity. Well written and worn reading."}, {"userName": "Kingfan30", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5755967-kingfan30", "userReview": "This is the story of a young engineer from Guyana visiting England on a work project to help build a sea defence. He lodges with an unusual character Mrs Rutherford for his stay and this book really is his views on her and life in an English village.
