I can only hope so, Its my favourite genre! Thankfully I managed to score an advanced copy of this little beauty Beside Myself, and I loved it!Helen and Ellie are identical twins. There was a complication at birth and the cord was wrapped around Ellie\u2019s neck for an extended period of time and because of this she wasn\u2019t quite right. Sickly, and mentally slow compared to her sister, Ellie lived in Helens shadow. One day they decided to play a trick on everyone and swapped places. After managing to fool everybody, even their mother, Helen wanted to swap back. However Ellie refused, SHE was Helen now. After nobody believes her, and after encountering a lot of bad luck, Helen (Now Ellie\u2026. Or is she??) has to live her life as someone she isn\u2019t. And things don\u2019t go well for her. Now after many years, her sister is in a coma following an accident. Will she wake up? Will Helen ever get her real life back? Or is it even hers?The premise of this book was what grabbed me, that and the spooky cover. Twins are always interesting to read about. Being an only child myself I can only imagine what it would be like to have a sibling who is so physically similar to you. It was interesting to read about their connection.I\u2019m not sure if I would say this book is particularly thrilling as such, but the thrills come from reading about life from Ellies perspective. Her mental illness comes through so strongly in the writing of this book, it is really well done. The dark mood is also another thing that grabbed me about Beside Myself. You quickly get caught up in the depressing state that Ellie\u2019s life is now in, and get totally captivated with reading how she got to this point and what happens next.I thought the ending was fantastic. There was a revelation that I was not expecting. However the book itself was quite slow moving in places. I understand a bit of a slower pace was needed to set the scene, however it almost got to dragging point for a little while about 60% in. But then it started to pick up again, and I devoured the rest.I have a thing about medical inaccuracies in novels. It drives me nuts. And there were a few scenes in the hospital that I picked up on. Especially the one where Helen was speaking with a breathing tube in which is impossible and a common medical mistake in a few novels I have read, however I also noticed that because of the tone of that scene it could be argued that Ellie was imagining it. Which makes it alright I guess. Didn\u2019t stop me from enjoying it overall though!It was written really well, and I loved all the characters. Ellie (or Helen\u2026 Or is it Ellie?) was such a great leading character. Such an interesting story. It jumped back and forth in time with each chapter, which confused me at the beginning but I quickly got used to it.Would I recommend Beside Myself?Yes, for any psychological thriller fan!Thanks to author Ann Morgan via NetGalley for an advanced copy in exchange for my review.For more reviews visit my blogwww.booksbabiesbeing.comFacebookwww.facebook.com/booksbabiesbeingTwitterwww.twitter.com/BBB_Mel"}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "Beside Myself tells the story of twins, a childish game that goes horribly wrong and the echoes of that throughout the life of at least one of the twins.Ann Morgan is a stunning writer - the use of language in this novel is really very good and atmospheric, I enjoyed the reading of it for that reason, I just wish I had been more enamoured of the story itself. You know how sometimes it just doesn't quite work for you as a reader? That was the problem I had with this novel. One of those \"No Two people ever read the same book\" moments.So in Beside Myself two twins swap places one day to tease their mother and others. One twin however likes her new personality and doesn't want to swap back. The other twin loses her mind. Thats basically it in a nutshell although of course there is a lot more to it than that. I just got a bit lost is all...There were not really any characters I liked. Thats not a problem usually I'm a fan of unlikeable characters that make you crazy,but in Beside Myself there was not any one of them that gave me the other side of that - the need to root for them and get behind them. And it all was a little unlikely. The speed at which the originally confident and bossy twin fell into a practical coma seemed unrealistic. Same with the less confident, bumbling twin who suddenly took on her sister's traits with no real hiccups. And the mother, honestly. Anyway...When we move forward in time, we meet one of them after they have moved away. She has mental problems and well, is just strange. She gets pulled back into the vortex of family when her Sister has an accident - from there things picked up a bit for me, I was intrigued to find out what would happen with this \"swap\" scenario, whether anyone would actually bother to notice all these years later, and for a while in the middle I was totally in it. Sadly the ending didn't really do it for me either. I was hoping for a bit of a twist to make me go \"ooh\" but the twist was more of an \"oh\" moment it really just continued in the same vein for the majority of the book and ended up vaguely annoying me. This is an exploration of personality and as such will probably work really well for a lot of readers and certainly Ann Morgan's writing ability and talent is right up there - to the point that I will definitely be interested to read anything else she writes. But Beside Myself didn't really work on a lot of levels, due to my own personality being vaguely grumpy about unlikely plot holes at the moment.I'd definitely recommend this though if you are a fan of psycologial thrillers - because what is sauce for the goose is NOT necessarily what is sauce for the gander and there is a lot to admire in \"Beside Myself\" as you can see from other reviews.Happy Reading Folks!"}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn", "userReview": "[Initially, I did have some doubt that the original Ellie, a mentally slow, clumsy child could suddenly take on the persona of her quicker, brighter sister without their friends and teachers noticing and vice versa that the original Helen would be treated as a child needing remedial help with reading, writing and maths when she was quite capable. However, I think the question of whether the swap really wasn't reversed becomes ambiguous as the story progresses and in the end I don't think it matters (even though there is more to confirm the swap at the end of the book). The treatment of Ellie as the less than perfect child by her mother seems to be the main issue and maybe only accelerated mental illness (possibly inherited?) that was always going to emerge at some stage.

The way this mother treats her twin daughters is unbelievable. At the age of 6 Helen wants her and Ellie to try and trick people by switching clothes and acting like the other. You see, Helen was the normal one and Ellie had some issues.. they say it was a problem when she was being born. This was the biggest mistake Helen ever made in her life. Ellie decides she wants to be Helen forever and it really makes you wonder and realize Ellie was a great actress because she really had some issues, but she played Helen to a T! Helen ends up having a horrific life. I can't believe how her family treated her and I wonder if Ellie would have been treated the same way if she stayed her true self. I was hoping that something would vindicate Helen at some point. The last few pages of the book was the only happy moment that Helen really seemed to have. A tragedy happens in the family and Helen is brought back into their lives for a short time. She gets to meet Ellie's husband Nick and daughter Heloise. Nick broke down and told her in confidence one night that he always thought Ellie aka Helen wasn't herself. She seemed like a different person...well she was! But things head South with this visitation and Helen had to leave again. Although, I loved the time she got to spend with Heloise, she was a precious little girl and she seemed to love Helen. The mother was horrible all the way up until the end and when she revealed a secret to Helen I was just devastated! I mean this woman had something really bad happen to her when the kids were young and she had a hard time dealing with it, but to do these things to your kids. Wow! I hesitate to say I enjoyed the book because of all the horrible things, but I did like the book, although it made me really sad and mad. Advice to any twins out there...... DO. NOT. TRADE. PLACES. WITH. YOUR. TWIN! **I would like to thank NETGALLEY and BLOOMSBURY USA for giving me the opportunity to read an ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review.**"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "This is an interesting debut novel, which explores themes of identity, deception and some seriously flawed, dysfunctional family relationships. It begins with two little girls \u2013 Helen and Eleanor. They are twins and Helen is the oldest and the leader. Her mother sees her as the \u2018good girl\u2019 while Eleanor (Ellie) is often troublesome with mild behaviour problems and is apt to get things wrong and need looking after. Although Helen is perceived as the smarter and more well behaved as the two, it is also cleverly insinuated that she can something of a bully, rather than a \u2018leader.\u2019 One day, Helen has the brilliant idea of swapping places and making her, rather severe, mother amused with the joke that her good girl could be Ellie; tripping along behind her sister. When they go back to the house though, they find that there have been changes they did not expect and then Ellie does not want to change back\u2026Going forward to today, we find that Helen (now known completely as Ellie, or \u2018Smudge\u2019) has grown from the competent child into the perceived \u2018failure\u2019 that her mother expected. Her identity taken, she spirals into mental illness and a life of poverty and isolation. Ellie (or Helen) however, has had success, marriage to Nick and a daughter, Heloise who, by coincidence, is six years old \u2013 the same age as the twins when they changed places.When Helen is injured in an accident and ends up in a coma, it results in their mother calling Smudge to inform her (rather unwillingly) about what has happened. The twins mother is controlling, opinionated and unsympathetic and, her getting back in touch, leaves Smudge feeling out of control. Then Helen\u2019s husband, Nick, appears, hoping that she can shed light on why he feels that his wife was travelling to see her twin when she had the accident. The storyline splits between the past and the present as we learn what happened when the twins were young and whether the truth about their identity will be uncovered.I found this a difficult and disturbing read. The family dynamics were often deeply unsettling and upsetting, the characters mostly unlikeable and the plot twists a little less surprising than, perhaps, I had hoped. On the plus side, this was written extremely well and, of course, it is not essential to like the characters in a novel. I found this a very interesting read, but not as immersive as I first expected. I would certainly read more by this author, as it was an assured and impressive debut, but somehow this just fell a little short for me. Lastly, I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, for review. Rated 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7477266-sarah", "userReview": "This book was quite a crazy ride from start to finish. I was expecting a thriller but it wasn't so much a thriller as it was a dark, twisted psychological story so it wasn't quite what I was expecting. It was also much slower than I anticipated it would be and I thought it was too long. I felt like things were added in to make it longer when it really could have been better if it was shorter and more solid as a story. I feel like this book didn't really know what it wanted to be. It had an idea but it needed to be more concise. There were lots of uneccessary things in the story and it sometimes went about things the wrong way. It was basically a bit all over the place- partly because of the writing and partly because of the story. The story is told in alternating chapters of past and present from the real Helen's POV. There was a lot going on in the past chapters and even more going on in the present chapters. I thought there was too much going on to be honest and I think it's because there were too many unimportant details on top of the already complicated story. I found this book quite hard to get into because i found it quite confusing and slow and there were times were I considered not finishing it but I'm glad I finished it because overall, it was pretty decent and I enjoyed it. What really kept me reading was my desire to know what would happen at the end. I'm someone who finds it really hard to not finish books or movies because I feel like I need to know! If you're not that kind of person, then this book may not be for you. I only say that because this book doesn't have a lot of redeeming qualities. It's complicated (not in a good way), it's long, it's got a really slow pace, it has no likeable characters or relatable characters and the writing isn't good enough to carry the book. In fact, I didn't particularly like the writing at all, it wasn't bad per say but it just wasn't for me. The end turned out to be sort of anticlimactic and I was disappointed with it but it did clear up some things. I feel like I bashed this book a bit but at the end of the day, my feelings towards the book are more positive than negative and that's what got this book 3 stars from me. I can recognise that it's not a bad book but it's just not a good one either. It sits in the \"average\" section. Would I recommend it? Hmmm, not really unless you read tonnes of dark twisted psychological fiction and you're thinking this may interest you. Would I read another book by Ann Morgan? Probably not but I'm open to it! * I received a free copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u201cMy memories of him are like a sweet that you have sucked too long until all the flavour is gone.\u201d\u201cBecause you are not here \u2013 that\u2019s the truth of it.

Helen is the dominant twin who seems to find life a lot easier than her sister Ellie who is simpler (or so Helen thought), they swap places but after having a little taste of what it is like to be the more favourable twin Ellie decides she isn't going to swap back. Their mother Margaret doesn't believe a word that comes out of Helens mouth and it turns out neither does anyone else for that matter and so it begins..The story takes us from the past to the present between each chapter which is good because you do get used to it, but then some parts of the story I could have done without, I feel it was just to fill pages. When the girls swap identities I find it very hard to believe that friends, family and our educational services can't tell the girls apart, I also believe the book was more about mental health rather than a thriller. Don't get me wrong the book is written well and some parts made me think that when I have children myself I will never treat or favour a child over another as this alone you could see the damage it causes. I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters in the book which I think is why I couldn't really get into it. I didn't like either of the girls but I did feel sorry for Smudge, but then I believe that she never helped herself in any way, shape or form and that put me straight off her again.I can see why people would really like this book as it is well written and some parts made you think of they way others are treated, but it just wasn't for me."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9809518-christine", "userReview": "DNF somewhere towards the last bit.

Not a heartwarming twin story, except for maybe one chapter near the end, but by then your heart is so cold and frozen you wonder if it will ever thaw. A bit of hope enters in the last chapter but you have seen hope dashed many times in this gruesome tale. In fact, a reader who comes through with a warm heart is likely more screwed up than these twins ever were.Ann Morgan is the writer who got me not just thinking about reading literature from many countries. She got me doing it because of her 2015 opus, The World Between Two Covers, an account of her completed quest to read a work of fiction from every country on Earth in one year. There was no way I was going to miss her debut novel. In summarizing her international reading experience, she describes how reading all those books changed her and opened up possibilities previously not glimpsed as to the many ways fiction could be created. The evidence of those changes shows in Beside Myself.Helen and Ellie are six when they embark on a dangerous game. Helen is the older because she was the twin born first. She is the \u201cgood one.\u201d Ellie is slower, dreamy, clumsy, and when anything goes wrong in the family it is Ellie\u2019s fault. Helen makes up the game. They are going to swap; Ellie will be Helen and Helen will be Ellie. It will be fun to trick their mum and then even more fun when they tell her what they did. Trouble is, Ellie is very good at playing Helen and when the time comes to switch back, she doesn\u2019t. She convinces Mother she really is Helen. The real Helen is stuck being Ellie from that day on.It sounds like a fairytale doesn\u2019t it? And the story carries on like those Grimm\u2019s tales with all the creepiness and horror that have given children nightmares for years. Helen, as Ellie, spirals down throughout the rest of her childhood, living through one disheartening incident after another, until she is a broken mentally ill substance abuser living on welfare. Ellie, as Helen, grows up to be a famous celebrity with a trophy husband and rich beyond her dreams.Set in Great Britain, the novel is also filled with British life and British terms. If you\u2019ve read Kate Atkinson or Sara Waters or other contemporary authors from across the pond, you are grooved in. The story ratchets back and forth between the present day and the various stages of Helen\u2019s life as she grows up being Ellie, told in third person for the present and first person for the past. Her past is a study in the ways expectations by others form a personality, of how cruel kids can be to each other, and the contribution of those factors in the disintegration of Helen\u2019s identity. Such narrative choices leave the reader experiencing her disassociation and emotional despair.After a pivotal event, the voice from Helen\u2019s past changes from first to second person. She has moved outside of herself, watching as she begins to self-destruct. It is brilliant writing beyond what one would expect for a first novel. The marketers are calling this a psychological thriller but in reality it is a study in identity and in how the combined influences of family, heredity, and society can send a person over the edge. Despite the dark and gritty atmosphere, its portrayal of mental illness is one of the most sympathetic I\u2019ve read since One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.I suspect Beside Myself will do better in Great Britain than in the United States. That is a pity because it blows Gone Girl or The Girl on the Train out of the water. Think Patricia Highsmith or Muriel Spark or Jose Saramago.

I've been through them all personally myself \"are they twins?\" \"are they identical?\" and everyone's favourite quote \"double trouble! You've got your hands full there!\" So I was looking forward to this darker novel about twin girls who decide to swap places one day when they are six and, as one of them refuses to change back, it affects the lives of both girls into adulthood.Helen is the \"good twin\" who does well at school and is much loved by their mummy whereas Ellie is a little slower, not so popular at school or home. One day Helen thinks it would be fun to change places and they swap clothes, hairstyles etc. But Ellie likes the attention and enjoys being Helen so refuses to swap back. This leaves Helen stuck in the \"personality\" of Ellie which gradually because hers when no one believes what has happened to her. I found this such a sad book and was totally frustrated by it. The girls mother Margaret is awful! How 2 small girls can fool their own mother is totally unrealistic in my opinion but there are many hidden layers in this well executed debut novel and so you suspend believe as you get sucked into the story. It's a moral tale of how we act when we are pigeon holed into a specific role in life. My twins have taken place in studies since they were very young to see if it is nurture or nature that defines who we become as an adult. In this case, mental illness in the twins as adults is thought-provoking in very different ways, both girls affected by the differing life experiences and the personalities they took on.Our main focus is Helen-who-becomes-Ellie and we don't get such an insight into Ellie. I would have liked more of her story if I'm honest to get a balanced idea of why things happened and how and why she reacted the way she did. But that didn't spoil my reading experience of this disturbing insight into how society defines us from a very early age.

Well, for me, it was more of a deep exploration of bipolar and mental illness.Identical twins, Helen and Ellie decide to try and fool everyone by swapping names when they are 6 years old. Helen was the twin that \u201chad it together\u201d and was smart. Ellie was the troubled one, who was clumsy and slow-witted. At age six, both had a personality reputation. So when the girls swap, which was Helen\u2019s idea, Ellie refuses to swap back. This is the alleged pivotal point of the fall of Helen (who is now known as Ellie). At the beginning of the novel, author Ann Morgan shows how we react to behavior based upon assumptions. In other words, if Helen dropped her ice cream, it was an accident. If Ellie did, she was not being careful and being a dimwit. So, when the twins change places, Helen is shocked that she is judged as Ellie. From here, Ellie (the former Helen) falls apart.It begs the question about mental illness and bi-polar in particular: are life events triggers for the illness, or would the illness manifest itself on it\u2019s own. Also, how much of our life is influenced by labels assigned to us, and how difficult it is to break out of those labels.The chapters alternate between young Ellie and current time Ellie. We know Ellie does not fair well because of the current chapters. Where Morgan shines is writing the thoughts of a six year-old girl, especially one who is falling into madness while trying to make sense of her life. We see her life through her six year-old eyes. The tragedy of Elli\u2019s life and what becomes of her is heart wrenching. This is a gritty read. I expected the psychological aspect, but not the grittiness of mental illness. Morgan writes it like trying to get out of quicksand unaided. This novel opened my eyes to sadness and despairing lives of those afflicted.I highly recommend this for those who enjoy edgy novels about mental illness or enjoy page-turners. This is a sad novel.

I found these first pages strangely horrific \u2013 the voice of the little girl, Helen, who constantly seeks to \u201cteach her a lesson\u201d (her being her twin sister Ellie), Helen\u2019s voice is so nasty and malevolent I considered not reading any further. (And then there was the underlying hint of potential sexual abuse from a friend\u2019s older brother, another sinister voice/character). I really was in two minds as to carry on or not.Curiosity and a few days break from the book and I started reading again with an intensity that had me picking up this book every opportunity I could make. What a powerhouse of emotions and psychological twists this was! A brilliant study of identity, influences, how expectations effect children\u2019s (and adults I presume too) personality, mental health, achievements and general wellbeing.Mental health issues, suicide, self-harm, suicide are themes that are laid bare for all to consider. And the big one \u2013 the damage that is done when we do not believe a child \u2013 when they share they are being bullied or abused - in all forms of abuse. The most damage we can do is not believe or take seriously. WOW! Just WOW! I am exhausted! This book is complex and intense and illuminating and surprisingly optimistic. I am so pleased I decided to continue on reading this book. Everyone should read this book \u2013 the world might be a better place if it pricks our conscience and makes us look at the person next to us with a little more compassion.

Maybe it\u2019s the fun of having super cute, almost-five-year-old twins as my niece and nephew. Or maybe my interest stems from my 88-year-old grandfather, born a fraternal twin and the kind of man who casually says things like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a photo of me with a deer I shot using a bow I made myself.\u201d It\u2019s also possible it was just all those Sweet Valley books I read growing up. Whatever the cause, I find twins endlessly fascinating, and I am hard pressed to pass up a book that promises twinny drama.The twins in Ann Morgan\u2019s debut novel Beside Myself have a complicated relationship to say the least. Helen is the older, stronger, favored twin. Ellie, born after her sister with an umbilical cord around her neck, is slower, quieter, a hapless troublemaker. One day, Helen thinks of a new game the children can play\u2014they will switch places and see how long it takes their mother to notice. She and Ellie change their clothes and hair. Helen urges Ellie to adopt her own mannerisms and patterns of speech. She can\u2019t wait to see their mother\u2019s reaction to this hilarious prank.Except their mother doesn\u2019t notice. And\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014Ellie doesn\u2019t want to give up the coveted role of Helen. What was supposed to be a silly diversion for a few hours becomes a waking nightmare for the real Helen. No one believes her when she insists she\u2019s not Ellie. And why would they? Ellie has always had problems. Ellie can't be trusted. Helen is the golden child who has their mother\u2019s ear. If everyone thinks Helen is Ellie, why would they listen to a word of her bizarre story?Morgan uses alternating timelines to show how the twins\u2019 identity switch affects Helen (now Ellie) into her adult life. She is clearly mentally ill, hearing voices and living in a hoarder\u2019s nest of an apartment, paranoid and suspicious of everyone she encounters. She\u2019s also one of the best-written unreliable narrators I\u2019ve read for some time. It\u2019s hard to tell at the outset what is truly threatening to Helen/Ellie, and what is the product of her mental illness. Her struggles will make you think hard about identity\u2014and they demonstrate what can happen to the mind when others refuse to see us as we are. This book was my first foray into next year\u2019s releases, and it\u2019s certainly setting the bar high for 2016. Beside Myself had me riveted from start to finish.

Quite a few readers were raving about it which got me very curious and left me wanting to read it for myself. I have to say I absolutely love the cover of the book. The image on the cover had me envisioning a very dark read. The book description grabbed me even more and I really though this book would be right up my street.Unfortunately I just didn't gel with this novel at all and really struggled to get into the story. I so wanted to love this novel as from the image and description, it really did sound like my perfect read. I don't know if it was because the story flicks from past to present that made me struggle to enjoy it more or the fact that I found all the characters very dislikeable. Who knows, all I know that is unfortunately Beside Myself just isn't the book for me.Beside Myself is probably a prime example of how peoples tastes differ. Like I said I have seen so many great things being said about this book so I would definitely say to other readers not to let my review put you off reading this novel as it may end up being one that you love.

Non esiste la gemella?\u201d \u00e8 caduto nella noia. Dopo pagine su pagine, in cui gli unici argomenti sono deliri, disagi, autodistruzione e fughe fisiche e mentali, continuamente ripetuti, il tedio regna e non vedevo l\u2019ora di finirlo per liberarmene e passare ad altro.Accende diverse domande, per esempio quanto influisce l\u2019educazione ricevuta sulla personalit\u00e0 e sull\u2019intelligenza di un bambino.Helen (che d\u2019ora in avanti chiamer\u00f2 Smudge perch\u00e9 se no si rischia confusione) finch\u00e9 era lei era malefica e intelligente, Hellie era la vittima e quella con deficit cognitivi, allo scambio i ruoli si sono invertiti (molto inverosimilmente secondo me).Parlando di illogicit\u00e0, possibile che nella sua vita Smudge non ha mai trovato chi la comprendesse, la aiutasse, chi se ne prendesse cura? Ma solo persone egoiste, grette, che se ne sono approfittate e alla prima difficolt\u00e0 l\u2019hanno scaricata. Nessuno le ha dato un minimo di credito, non la mamma (la spiegazione finale \u00e8 a dir poco rivoltante), non le amiche, non le insegnati, non i vicini, non Nick, non Gareth (quest\u2019ultimi due rasentano il disgusto).Le due gemelle avevano dei problemi mentali (ereditari? Possiamo solo supporlo, perch\u00e9 come tante altre cose, tipo la presunta violenza subita dalla madre, che avrebbero potuto essere approfondite, sono state del tutto ignorate), il suicidio del padre li ha aggravati (iniziando da Hellie e ha scatenato tutto il resto) e ha destabilizzato l'ambiente famigliare.La madre assente, egoista (e schifosa) non solo non le ha aiutate, ha anche peggiorato la situazione e, considerando che era al corrente dello scambio e le motivazioni per le quali ha taciuto, il suo comportamento \u00e8 anche peggio di quello che sembrava.Il punto pi\u00f9 basso toccato? Quando la madre ha accusato Smudge di essere un mostro!!! Ma quale madre fa una cosa cos\u00ec (ripeto: sapendo tutto)? Una vera e propria \ud83d\udca9Si potr\u00e0 obiettare che questo \u00e8 solo il POV di Smudge ma la sua storia, alla fine, \u00e8 confermata dalle parole della mamma e dalla lettera della sorella.Purtroppo non c\u2019\u00e8 nessun riconoscimento pubblico (la madre davanti agli altri negher\u00e0 sempre e la lettera \u00e8 andata perduta), l\u2019unica cosa positiva \u00e8 che, finalmente Smudge sembra riesca ad andare avanti. L\u2019ultima singolarit\u00e0 \u00e8 che gli eventi sono narrati in prima persona singolare al presente per gli eventi del passato fino ad un certo punto, poi si \u00e8 passati alla seconda persona singolare al presente, dopo la violenza quasi a sottolineare il distacco da se stessa che ha provato e che agogna, mentre gli eventi del presente sono stranamente narrati in terza persona al passato per la quale non sono riuscita a darmi una spiegazione.
