Everything I have read by this author has impressed me. It doesn\u2019t matter the genre. Some people just have the gift and this man does it with finesse and style.This is a great tale that kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn\u2019t wait to come back to this story.There is so much to offer and I am so glad I picked this book up on amazon.com. There was non-stop action that kept me wondering all the way through.Not long after the Civil War, Patrick O'Malley investigates the death of Edgar Allen Poe. Before this story, I knew very little about Edgar Allen Poe although I do remember writing an essay on his life in middle school. This is an intriguing mystery that you will not want to put down. Such a great intriguing mystery. The drama will keep you guessing and the adventure will take you for an exciting ride into the unknown. Highly recommended and worth the ride.Quote ~\u201cIf I must be pursued by an experienced killer for the rest of my life because of this case, I am ready to give it up. What\u2019s the chance that I will be able to capture this killer? Even if I do capture him alive, how will I be able to get the information from Reynolds concerning who paid for him to kill me? I needed to talk about my clues and about what I should do to set a trap for the killer\u2026\u201d"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/357665-jim", "userReview": "First Place in the 2013 CLUE Book Awards for Mysteries, Suspense and Thrillers. Finalist in the Next Generation Indie Book Awards, 2014.\u00a0What if Edgar Allan Poe did not die in Baltimore as a drunk in the gutter? What he were, instead, murdered?\u00a0In post Civil War New York City, Detective Pat O'Malley is living inside Poe's Cottage in the Bronx. O'Malley is haunted by Poe one night, and the detective finds a strange note. As a result, O'Malley decides to prove that Edgar Allan Poe did not die in Baltimore from an alcoholic binge but was, instead, murdered. O'Malley quickly becomes embroiled in a \"cold case\" that thrusts him into the lair of one of the most sinister and ruthless killers in 1865 New York City.\u00a0Jim Musgrave's Forevermore is a quick read in four acts that will keep your mind razor sharp trying to solve the mystery of Poe's murder. Pat O'Malley must first find out how to become intimate with females before he can discover the final clue in this puzzle of wits, murder and romance.\u00a0\u02c3\u02c3\u02c3 Mini-Mystery in the Manner of Poe\"If any literary work is too long to be read at one sitting, we must be content to dispense with the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression for, if two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, and everything like totality is at once destroyed.\" Edgar Allan Poe\u00a0\u02c3\u02c3\u02c3 Kindle Book Review (Carol Piner)I adore Edgar Allan Poe and when I started Forevermore by Jim Musgrave I thought, \"Oh no...another book about how bad Poe was.\" Was I in for a marvelous shock! The author, Jim Musgrave, envisioned a young man who admired Poe, even lived in his cottage, and wished to find out what Poe died of, why and who was responsible for the death of the dark poet.\u00a0Delving into Poe's life just before he died, Patrick O'Malley began his quest into Poe's death. The search for the truth led him to many famous writers such as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who hated Poe. John Anderson, the owner of a tobacco shop, who violated a young woman who worked for him, is another. She was the famous \"Mary\" from one of Poe's novels. O'Malley was told Anderson paid Poe to write the tale to avoid suspicion regarding her death. Oddly enough, John Anderson lived in Sleepy Hollow made famous by the tale of the \"Headless Horseman\". Other famous names were sprinkled throughout this mystery. Literary references ran rampant and Musgrave was adept at making them fit into his tale.\u00a0You will also be introduced to the low life. McKenzie, who became a protector, was head of the Plug Uglies. I'll let you read the book to find out what that means. I also met a certain Madame who introduced O'Malley to heights he had never attained before. You will find Joshua Reynolds a person who could have been the subject of Poe's worst visions.\u00a0There is no generally accepted reason for Poe's death. Some said alcohol, some dementia and others believed diabetes. We know he died in Baltimore in the gutter, dressed like a bum. Mr. Musgrave weaved a wonderful tale and came up with a perfectly believable reason for not only how Poe died, but also why he died like a bum. He was killed. If you want to know by whom, you will have to read the book.\u00a0\u02c3\u02c3\u02c3 Portland Book ReviewMost historians uphold that literary legend Edgar Allan Poe died from complications to his crippling alcoholism. But private detective Pat O\u2019Malley believes otherwise. He believes that Poe was actually a victim of murder. In Forevermore, O\u2019Malley sets forth on a mission of danger and romance to uncover the truth behind the demise of his old friend and one of America\u2019s most important authors."}, {"userName": "Rob Slaven", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14011226-rob-slaven", "userReview": "As usual, I received this book because somebody gave it to me for free. In this case, the author approached me directly with a copy of the whole trilogy as one volume. Despite this kind consideration, I give my candid opinions below, as will quickly become self-evident.Firstly, a few general comments and a readers recommendation. It is suggested that you read this book in the following manner: read the first chapter and allow the oddness of it to roll around in your head for a few moments. Then sally you forth unto Wikipedia and read the real events as recorded by history. Smirk bemusedly at yourself for a few seconds and then continue to read the rest of the novel. Anything less enigmatic than that is left as exercise to the reader. On the positive side, our author has picked an fascinating episode of history for his target. Saying more than that will spoil the fun but it is my considered opinion that historical fiction is best when it starts out with some reality that is abundantly screwball in its own right and expands upon it in a realistic way. I won't go so far as to say that this book is a potential truth of the matter, but the thread of the tale has a pleasant glow of vague plausibility to it that fits well with the genre. Furthermore, the book is easy and accessible but still endeavors to expand the reader's knowledge of history (and vocabulary) without any significant missteps. The author has done his homework, despite what other reviewers may say to the contrary.On the negative side, the novel does suffer from some fairly significant editorial woes. At times it's difficult to tell who the narrator of a given passage is and transitions in time and place are sometimes hard to pick up on. The text is rife with historical references but at times so rife that they feel rather forced. I appreciate the author's research but one doesn't have to stuff everything he knows about 19th century life into one book. Lastly, during our dramatic climax the book reads more like an Abbott and Costello routine than a serious mystery novel. As a reader I'm happy to accept either but it is generally preferred if the author picks one or the other and sticks with it.In summary, this is a very well conceived novel but it must be remembered that readers of the mystery genre especially are punctilious beasts that will pick apart every detail of every sentence you write. They have to because they must find the answer before the end arrives. That's rather the point of reading a mystery novel. So while this novel is generally good, it's not quite up to the standards of its chosen genre. It's a brilliant initial step though and I look forward to the next two in the series."}, {"userName": "Lynne Cantwell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6176678-lynne-cantwell", "userReview": "Edgar Allan Poe has always been one of my favorite authors. He is probably best known today for writing \"The Raven.\" But his horror stories are classics, and deservedly so; my all-time favorite is still \"The Masque of the Red Death.\"Poe is also credited with creating the genre of detective fiction, and it's on this particular hook that Musgrave hangs his hat. Forevermore is narrated by Pat O'Malley, an acquaintance of Poe's, who takes it upon himself to investigate the mystery surrounding the author's death in Baltimore in 1849. But instead of traveling to Baltimore, O'Malley confines his search to the area around New York City, where many of Poe's acquaintances lived. He begins to suspect that Poe was killed in connection with the murder case that Poe used as the basis of one of his detective stories, \"The Mystery of Marie Rog\u00eat.\"The real-life murder victim, Mary Cecelia Rogers, may have had an abortion prior to her death. Musgrave runs with that, and further emphasizes the Victorian-era discomfort with bodily matters by giving O'Malley an odd sexual dysfunction -- he is unable to be intimate with a woman. It's when he begins to make progress on this problem that he begins to find his way to the truth about Poe's mysterious death.Musgrave appears to be aiming for a steampunk vibe. I found it only partly convincing; sometimes O'Malley's voice dropped out of the Victorian vernacular and used modern phrases, and sometimes the prose was even more overwrought than a real Victorian would write. Still, Forevermore was worth a look. ***Originally published at http://hearth-myth-rursday-reads.blog..."}, {"userName": "Book Lovers Never Go to Bed Alone", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16708172-book-lovers-never-go-to-bed-alone", "userReview": "Jim Musgrave's novel Forevermore is a fascinating look into the death of Edgar Allen Poe. The master of Gothic died under just as mysterious of circumstances as many of his famous tales. The records were lost and we are left with only questions about this bizarre figure of American fiction. Musgrave does a marvelous job of reconstructing as much as he could and then embellishes fact with his own fiction to unravel a \"possible who done it\" with grand style.Patrick O'Malley, our protagonist, is a Poe fan. Unsettled by the unexplained circumstances, he begins his own investigation. The narrative is crisp and the story well-paced as O'Malley meets the famous and infamous of the period in his quest for the truth. The historical details are rich and Musgrave brings the period to life. The streets of 1800s America are vivid and lively by day, but Musgrave introduces us to the dark shadows of the era that lurked in the darkness.For Poe fans, this is a fun read. It's an interesting take on one of history's great mysteries. For fans of historical fiction, you too will be pleased. Murder mystery fans will want to check this out as well.

The story starts with a prologue on October 3, 1849, four days before Poe\u2019s death. Poe takes a train to Balltimore, and is aware that he is being followed. As he is walking from the station, he is knocked out. He wakes up on a bench in front of a tavern, drenched in alcohol and in different clothes and his pistol missing, making it look like a robbery. He has a knot on his head and hallucinates, thinking he sees people with cat heads.Read the rest of my review on Leafmarks."}, {"userName": "Randee Baty", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4474156-randee-baty", "userReview": "How did Edgar Allen Poe die?

His investigation is 16 years after Poe's death so he has to trace down leads where he can find them. What he finds leads him into deep trouble and weird conclusions!The plot is imaginative and the writing style is fine but I'm sorry to say I found this book troubling. There was a emphasis on the sex life (or lack of it) of the detective and I didn't see how that helped the plot at all. It was distracting because I kept wondering why the author put that story line in the book. There was a lot of discussion of affairs and abortions. This was not what I was expecting or wanting in a book like this at all. It didn't feel connected or smooth. It just left a bad aftertaste to me.

But I didn't. I know the author put a lot of effort into this book, and I respect that. The author did a lot of research to incorporate Edgar Allan Poe into the plot. The passages about Poe and his life were the best parts of the book, in my opinion. But much of the book read as if it hadn't undergone a final edit. The protagonist, for example, \"poured\" over a manuscript at one point, when the correct verb should have been \"pored,\" unless he was pouring liquid over the pages. Most of the book read like a mystery, but then at the end there's a grisly horror scene that didn't seem to fit.

As a former editor, I was surprised to find editing errors in the book--particularly one by someone who runs English Majors Reviewers and Editors. In several places \"I\" was used instead of \"It.\" In another, it's \"addiction\" instead of \"addition.\" I know there were several others that I can't recall off the top of my head.The main character, an Irish Civil War Medal of Honor winner was somewhat intriguing.
