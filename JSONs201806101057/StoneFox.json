We are getting more of that of late...she is unimpressed by my reading piles and I love that she wants to share the books she enjoys with me. This was a book her third-grade teacher read aloud to the class this year. It's based on a legend that may be true (but may not be), and I think reading it aloud is just the way to read it. It's almost too short for me to count here (I would have read it in one sitting if not for the fact that it was late at night and I couldn't stay awake any longer).Not a bad book, and I'm guessing it transcends the gender line. Little Willy is one tough kid, and who doesn't want a dog like Searchlight? Beyond that, though, is the underlying story of love and hope. For me, this was a story about how we can learn from the children in our lives, and it's a reminder of Jesus's admonition to be like children."}, {"userName": "Seahee Park", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5906390-seahee-park", "userReview": "At first, I thought this will be just another little sweet and happy ending story, which is all time Americans' favorite (like all the Disney stories). But as I read through, I was in such a shock I couldn't even think straight. Poor little Willy and Searchlight going through the toughest time of their lives without anyone's help was just pitiful enough. But the most shockingly, when searchlight's heart just bursted and died instantly right before finishing his race, my brain felt like it bursted as well. The way Gardiner wrote the book about the race was so compelling and intensive that I couldn't stop reading a line after another. After finishing the book, this shocking yet touching story was not forgetable. So I told this story to my mother and sister and they were touched (and actually cried) by the story just from listening to me. Even still now thinking about it gives me a strange feeling inside."}, {"userName": "Emily Beeson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/835490-emily-beeson", "userReview": "Book Review: Stone Fox by John Reynolds GardinerI read this book aloud to my kids today, and let me tell you. I was a blubbering fool. I used to roll my eyes and laugh when my mom cried at emotional stories. Now I'm her. Except this time, Bubs (nearly 7) wasn't rolling his eyes. He was crying, too.Are you familiar with this very short chapter book? Here's a brief overview:Little Willy may only be ten, but that doesn't mean he can't run a potato farm. His grandfather has become very ill. Willy is determined to make everything better by harvesting the potato crop.When that doesn't help matters, Willy discovers a debt that his grandfather owes for $500. Against all odds, Willy enters a dog-sled race, where he'll compete against the best racers in the country, including the huge Indian, Stone Fox, who has never lost a race. Will his determination and courage be enough?As mentioned, this book is a tear-jerker. However, it spurred great conversation (great enough to make me forget I had an appointment...), and I'm glad we read it together.(See hundreds of reviews of Deliciously Clean Reads at my blog: http://homespunlight.blogspot.com/ )"}, {"userName": "Mandie Peterson", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55569139-mandie-peterson", "userReview": "[ Little Willy has a dog named Searchlight.

While I read it aloud to my class, I had a lot of doubts. The writing is fine, but I was not thrilled with the story\u2019s glumness. I don\u2019t oppose that, on principle, or in general, but it just did not seem to have a point. There were also details that did not float my boat or got stuck in my craw. For example, I was confused by the grandfather\u2019s condition, very confused, and still am.However, the stunned silence of the children at the end, the tears of quite a few, and the ending itself, was quite extraordinary. Now there are details at the end and throughout I must savour and mull over, such as Stone Fox's actions. I\u2019m thinking about the entire story because of that ending, and that\u2019s a great effect to achieve despite the restraints on word choice, syntax, etc. of writing for this age group.

Each and every single student, boys and girls alike, were thoroughly enjoying the book and from what little I\u2019d learned about it while there, I just knew I had to add it to my list of future reads. It did not disappoint! The book was easy to relate to and certainly pulled at my heartstrings. The theme of hope, hard work, and dedication are practically my motto and this book can be enjoyable and beneficial for many age groups. Purpose \u2013 3rd to 4th grade read-aloud or read-to-self. This book could serve many lessons. I could use it for history and geography studies. It would be great for lessons on character traits, story elements, literary devices, and personal connections (text-to-self, text-to-world, text-to-text). This book could be used for a creative writing assignment as well. Other Comments \u2013 Super fast and easy read!

I'm now finishing college and this short story has touched me just as much. I used to cry just over the ending for the obvious reason, which I won't mention because \"spoilers\", but now I teared up through the whole story and *sobbed* at the end. My own experiences with mental health gave me insight and compassion to Grandfather's condition, and (as cliche as it sounds) having a close relationship with my own dog gave a personal element to Willy's relationship with Searchlight.What struck me the most about this story, however, is the unexpected respect and humanity with which Stone Fox, a Native American man, is portrayed. The book was written in 1980 and John Reynolds Gardiner first heard the legend in 1974. Historically, Native American peoples have not been written or shown in media in positive roles - they are the savages, the ignorant comic relief, the 'bad guys'. But (spoiler ahead) Stone Fox is the hero of this story - he saves the white man from the white man. He shows Willy the most love, the most respect, the most compassion, at the cost of his own goals and reputation. It was beautiful to finally see respect given to a Native American character and was probably 50% of the reason I cry whenever reading this story."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2844465-brian", "userReview": "My 8-year-old brought this home from school and told me I should read it, so I did.
