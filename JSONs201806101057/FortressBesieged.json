It is first a social satire, lampooning the hypocrisy of contemporary academia, and the bizarre tangled rituals of courtship and arranged marriages.Our story starts with a young screw-up who is returning to Shanghai after wasting time and money studying in Europe and never getting a degree. He purchases a degree from a diploma mill to cover his tracks, and then botches two relationships with a woman and her cousin by somehow convincing them both he'd like to marry them, and the whole thing goes to hell when they find out about each other. Distraught, he wanders toward the middle of the country after accepting an offer from a new university. This part of the case study is a look at petty campus politics and the many frauds of academia (including another teacher who has a degree from the same 'school' as the protagonist). As a result of campus bickering, there are rumors that he is in a relationship with another teacher, and they marry out of expedience.The third and final part of the story takes a much different tone from the first two. This is a somber picture of how a marriage falls apart, especially one which was forced together. The story ends with a clock chiming, a few hours slow, as the protagonist sits and thinks.The social satire is sometimes brilliant. He lampoons things like the tendency of intellectuals to sprinkle foreign phrases into their ordinary speech, but also the continual tendency for Chinese speakers to choose bizarre English names. He laughs at and mocks everything pompous, cliched, prejudiced. The narrator makes a few shocking remarks about how all Chinese are like this, or how all foreigners and women are like that, but he has an uncanny knack of showing how those prejudiced often imitate those qualities which they claim to despise. The book requires some 50 pages of notes in order to explain all the literary references the author makes. Yet despite this genuine breadth of knowledge, the book reads badly. The dialogue is clunky and sometimes even cliched. I'm going to be generous and blame the translator - but not too much, as they at least attempted to translate the puns. In the broadest sense, it seems to fit into the mold of other early 20th century novels - of young men and women desperately grappling with the changes of their times - the disintegration of the old world and the fierce edge of the new. So many of these characters are frauds and charlatans, and many are the butt of extended jokes. But I also can't shake the feeling that somehow Qian Zhongshu pities them."}, {"userName": "Letitia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11145485-letitia", "userReview": "Fortress Besieged (1947) is one of the most famous and influential Chinese novels of the 20th century, and yet I had never heard of it myself till last year. \u94b1\u949f\u4e66 writes about a generation of Western-educated Chinese youths, and is knowledgeable enough about Europe and America to poke fun at everyone, from French diplomats to the Irish, though he saves his most savage lampooning for the Chinese themselves. Perhaps he overdoes it a little, sometimes you want to tell his characters to JUST STOP, but recalling similar incidents with some of my own extended family members, I can say that he has accurately captured the pattern (though perhaps exaggerated the amplitude) of pettiness, sly bickering, and the combative mindset of constantly trying to take advantage of everyone and guarding against everyone else taking advantage of you.For me, it was a fascinating look into life in 1930s China. There is a picaresque cross-country journey in which he mercilessly derides the country's backward and bureaucratic transport systems and the repulsiveness of Chinese innkeepers, and a couple of exhibits of labyrinthian Chinese office politics, one set at a university in the middle of nowhere, and a smaller one at a Shanghai newspaper. The marriage at the end (spoiler, the book is about courtship and marriage) was so believable it was painful to read, much like Madame Bovary. The blurb compares Hongjian to Emma Bovary, but \u94b1\u949f\u4e66 is no Flaubert and his prose does not rank at the top of the Chinese authors I have read, though he does have many insightful literary metaphors and satirical observations. I was surprised by how funny his writing was, and how often I burst out laughing in the first two-thirds of the book. For example, the scene where Hongjian meets the gauche, Americanised English-spouting \u5f20\u5148\u751f (p39) and the description of the landlady's carnage picking lice out of her daughter's hair at a bug-ridden hotel (p150) are friggin hilarious.Here are highlights from the book (I have over 30 highlights and favourite passages):p16: \u201c\u8c01\u77e5\u4ece\u51b7\u76d8\u5230\u5496\u5561\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u6837\u4e1c\u897f\u53ef\u53e3\uff1a\u4e0a\u6765\u7684\u6c64\u662f\u51c9\u7684\uff0c\u51b0\u6dc7\u6dcb\u5012\u662f\u70ed\u7684\uff1b\u9c7c\u50cf\u6d77\u519b\u9646\u6218\u961f\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u767b\u9646\u4e86\u597d\u51e0\u5929\uff1b\u8089\u50cf\u6f5c\u6c34\u8247\u58eb\u5175\uff0c\u4f1a\u957f\u65f6\u671f\u4f0f\u5728\u6c34\u91cc\uff1b\u9664\u918b\u4ee5\u5916\uff0c\u9762\u5305\u3001\u725b\u6cb9\u3001\u7ea2\u9152\u65e0\u4e00\u4e0d\u9178\u3002\u201d[At a Western restaurant they thought looked respectable] \u201cTo their surprise, not a single dish from the cold cuts to the coffee tasted good.

It's a good thing I'm an optimistic person, or else I'd die of grief.\u201d Not only had Hongjian and Xinmei heard plenty of this kind of talk recently, but they themselves had said plenty of it. The ravages of war had certainly reduced many wealthy, landowning people to paupers, but at the same time it gave an untold number of paupers the opportunity to reminisce on their past riches. The Japanese burnt down so many imaginary mansions, seized so many utopian estates, and ruined innumerable one-sided romances.Hongjian is a loser and not a likeable character, but \u94b1\u949f\u4e66 paints his woes so vividly that you cannot help but be immersed in his \u8fdb\u9000\u4e24\u96be damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't world.

Published in the 1940s, and set in 1937-38 during the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war that preceded World War II, it's supposed to be a triumph of social satire, word play, and uniquely Chinese cynicism about relationships, families, and human behavior in general. If all this is true, then the translation in this version has not done Qian Zhongshu justice. Either that, or the social elements that he's sending up are so alien to a modern, western reader that getting the joke is a mostly hopeless endeavor. Put another way: at no point during my reading of Fortress Besieged was I able to discern what the big deal is about this book.I suspect the translation is not up to the task of communicating Qian's mastery of Chinese puns, twisted word play, diction-based comedy, and subtle absurdism. He peppers his writing with ancient proverbs that can't be translated literally without losing all meaning, but the translators (Jeanne Kelly and Nathan Mao) make little effort to find English equivalents, and instead leave us with gobbledegook. Sentences that are most likely dripping with irony come across as confusing or incoherent. Fortress Besieged needs an update. I'd be willing to try it again some day if a superior translation ever emerges."}, {"userName": "Horace Derwent", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54083442-horace-derwent", "userReview": ""}, {"userName": "Olive Huang", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16926197-olive-huang", "userReview": "Humorous of harsh language and the deeper observation on life.The title is based on a French proverb:Marriage is like a fortress besieged: those who are outside want to get in, and those who are inside want to get out.

El estilo de Zhongshu es fluido y accesible, y sus habituales referencias culturalistas consiguen otorgarle profundidad sin entorpecer la lectura.

That means the pool of books available to American readers in translation from, say, Mandarin is relatively limited\u2014only works of scholarly interest, unusual acclaim, or specifically Western appeal make their way to our libraries. Fortunately, Qian Zhongshu\u2019s classic Fortress Besieged meets all three criteria. Not only has it been the object of intense study and widespread consumption in the seventy-five years since its publication, but its consistent references to Western proverbs and literature make it uniquely relatable to an American audience. (The excellent translation by Nathan K. Mao and Jeanne Kelly also helps.) The reader follows Fang Hung-Chien, a graduate student returning home from Europe, as he stumbles through a sticky love triangle, an exhaustive trip to China\u2019s interior, and finally a bitter and loveless marriage. The author\u2019s intent sometimes seems to be to poke fun at every subject he can come up with, from the Chinese to the Jews, from government officials to university professors, from bachelors to husbands to women of every age. None of this, though, changes the novel\u2019s unique and undeniable cultural value. - Andrew R.

The writing, in Chinese at least, is superb, and the characters are so richly drawn that one images that Qian Zhongshu must have been drawing from life (a fact he alludes to in his preface). What little I have read of the English translation seems, unfortunately, to lack the nuanced voice of the original, with its heady mix of vernacular and classical idiom. Summary of the plot [SPOILER ALERT]: The protagonist, Fang Hongjian, is a ne\u2019er-do-well intellectual and son of a village scholar who has just returned home from a desultory period of studying abroad in Europe funded by the weathly Zhou family with whose daughter he had been arranged to marry prior to her death. Upon returning to Shanghai he becomes entangled in a courtship with Miss Su while secretly carrying on a romance with her cousin, Miss Tang. Miss Su\u2019s long time admirer, Zhao Xinmei, conspires to have Fang Hongjian given an offer of employment at Sanlu University in the countryside far away from Shanghai \u2013 and Miss Su. When Miss Su is rejected by Fang Hongjian following a moonlight kiss in the garden certain unsavory details of Fang Hongjian\u2019s past are revealed to Miss Tang and she breaks off her relationship with him by returning his love letters. Meanwhile Zhao Xinmei is for a nasty surprise when Miss Su accepts a marriage proposal the avant-garde poet Cao Yuanlang. Broken-hearted, Zhao Xinmei and Fang Hongjian decide to accept their offers from Sanlu U. This concludes the first section of the book. The middle section concerns the trip to Sanlu U in wearying detail, showing the dismal state of the Chinese countryside through the eyes of Western educated youth, and various situations that arise out of their employment by the self-aggrandizing and manipulative Gao Songnian, dean of Sanlu U. Students and teachers alike are criticized for a lack of real scholarship and a pursuit of money and empty certifications. Eventually things take a turn for the worse when Zhao Xinmei gets involved with Mrs. Wang, the wife of the Literature department head, and he flees to Chongqing to take up a government post. Bereft of his benefactor, Fang Hongjian is ousted, but not before a hasty engagement with a young Miss Sun Roujia, a family friend of Zhao Xinmei. They leave together and get married in Hong Kong at the urging of Zhao Xinmei who fears that Sun Roujia is pregnant. Another trip by boat back to Shanghai marks the transition to the last third of the book, which concerns the rapidly deteriorating relationship between Fang Hongjian and his new wife, due in no small part to their families mutual dislike for one another. As they struggle to find suitable work and housing in Shanghai things become increasingly acrimonious between the couple. In the very last scene of the novel, Fang Hongjian violently pushes Sun Roujia in the stomach, knocking a glass off the table in the process. She responds by throwing a comb at his face, drawing blood and breaking the comb into two parts. When he hears that the maid has called Roujia\u2019s aunt to come and rescue her, Hongjian flees. When he returns he discovers she is gone. The novel ends with Fang Hongjian falling asleep alone while scheming to get money for a trip to Chongqing where Zhao Xinmei has hinted he might be able to help find him a position in the government. Meanwhile, on the wall an ancient clock (a gift from Hongjian\u2019s father) ticks by, slowly and uncaringly.Overall my impression of the book was that Qian Zhongshu set out to write a satire and ended up writing a tragedy. Fang Hongjian is harmless enough when he has only himself to think of, but he makes a poor friend and a rather miserable husband. While it was easy to get caught up in the humor of the first third of the book, not to mention the comedy of errors between the various characters, the abrupt shift to Sanlu U and the even more sudden move back to Shanghai left me somewhat cold. I felt as if the world around Hongjian was becoming increasingly closed off, mirroring perhaps the feeling of the intellectuals trapped in wartime China. The final third of the book was a slog, albeit a well written one, with the ending being, more or less, as you expect it to be, with Qian Zhongshu detailing the trainwreck of the their marriage one fight at a time. To oversimplify greatly, the takeaway message seems to be that the ultimate responsibility for finding happiness in love and marriage lies with ourselves. This would seem to contradict the many authors who criticized the traditional system of arranged marriage, cf Xu Zhimo, Ba Jin, Lu Xun et al. This is not to say Qian Zhongshu was opposed to romantic love and in favor of arranged marriage but simply that he did not see free love as a panacea for the ills that plagued the troubled marriages he undoubtedly saw around him. If Fang Hongjian had been able to side with his wife over his parents, and if Sun Roujia had done likewise, then it seems likely that they would have been able to overcome their differences and live happily ever after, or at least more happily than they do in the book.In short, this is a well-written and important book, but not an easy one to get through."}, {"userName": "Yi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71154304-yi", "userReview": "The original version (in Chinese) is much better/funnier than the translated version."}, {"userName": "Lailai", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74816731-lailai", "userReview": "It is rare that in a Chinese novel there is so much humor!

His progress through the war-torn landscape of central-southern China to take up a teaching post at a new university in the interior, his dalliances with various modern variously liberated young women culminating in a marriage that disintegrates almost before it has begun, the great cast of self-obsessed, self-deceiving pseudo-intellectuals, relatives, servants, fellow-travellers, and the like are all woven together beautifully, the omniscient narrator has a nice turn of phrase and an ear for apt similie, and the dialogue often sparkles. [An aside: A society in transition, a society under strain, a society simultaneously pre-occupied with itself and with the West, a furious amount of posturing, corruption from head to toe, domestic traumas, now where have I heard that before...? Yes, it's a timely novel, despite being in its seventh decade, but don't let that put you off. \"Relevance\" is as much a curse as a blessing, and the relevance of this novel is, I suspect, considerably more enduring than any number of epochs we might be pasing through right now.]Having read several modern Chinese novels or travelogues (Soul Mountain, Red Dust, The Civil Servant's Notebook, etc) that, despite their brilliance, humour and undoubted power, were in many places rather crass and explicit, indeed tiresomely so, for me arriving at Fortress Beseiged was like a breath of cool, fresh air. We know that plenty of people in Jane Austen's novels have sex, but we don't have to be told about it all the time. There are many writers who could learn something from Qian Zhongshu about allusion, and not just to classical Chinese poetry."}], "description": "Set on the eve of the Sino-Japanese War, our hapless hero Fang Hung-chien (\u00e1 la Emma Bovary), with no particular goal in life and with a bogus degree from a fake American university in hand, returns home to Shanghai.

She hadn't any change of heart, since she didn't have a heart.\" In a sort of painful comedy, Fang obtains a teaching post at a newly established university where the effete pseudo-intellectuals he encounters in academia become the butt of Qian's merciless satire.
