Up above the world  is a disturbing novel and leaves you quivering inwardly. The whole story has an odd nightmarish atmosphere; heat and lushness of tropics clashes with coldness and some awkwardness of human relationships; descriptions of nature, colours and sounds of the jungle are picturesque and very accurate and hallucinations experienced by heroes horrifyingly palpable.The main protagonists remain for us enigma. American couple, Dr. Slade and his much younger wife Day, seem to be not very devoted to themselves. There is some indifference and languidness in their relationship, some ennui with slight shade of lenience. The Slades are strangely supine, like string puppets letting others manipulate them. They consider life as an eternal journey or maybe escape, anyway sum of accidental events. The Slades seem to think that common sense and some amount of money is enough to make people safe in this world. Couldn\u2019t be more wrong. When they meet charming stranger, not knowing how and why, fall victim to him; though almost for the very first page we sense they are doomed. They say  don\u2019t talk to strangers  and these words work here fully. But the problem is much more complex. Bowles' style is unsentimental and a bit flat when it comes to feelings and behaviors but never fails building a tension, an ominous aura, a sense of growing horror. It is really masterful. Mrs Slade thinks that true proximity between people is impossible and one can only dream of it. And maybe there is a point. Maybe Bowles wants to tell us that any human relationship is an anguish only a bit lesser than solitude itself, that we live alone and the same way we die. So, take a look into that garden of good and evil. But don\u2019t blame me if you have nightmare later."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5304930-mary", "userReview": "A noir-mystery meets existential horror story wrapped up in a Central American fever dream."}, {"userName": "Pantelis", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59132978-pantelis", "userReview": "To read in tandem with Ian McEwan's \"The comfort of strangers\"..."}, {"userName": "Mariel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647547-mariel", "userReview": "At some point in the night she had a dream. Or was it possible that she was partially awake, and was only remembering a dream?Do you know those greatest hits collection a popular band will put out late in their career? There will be a \"new hit\" shoehorned into the track listing. A familiar yet joyless sound flea backs on when something had to be said. I don't buy greatest hits at all. But those tearful youthful Christmases when your specific requests for a GOOD David Bowie album are ignored? Those times. The Sheltering Sky loses its footing (I didn't even like that one that much and I missed it). An elderly American doctor escorts his wife to compromise in tourist plans. If you want to stay we will move on tonight. His face is lined in betrayals. Why didn't you preread my mind, woman? She is younger because he is older. She is good because he is not. If he is around she could not mind any situation if he is against it. Mrs. Slade reminded me of children who behave younger when they are with their parents. Capable of more if it is the only option. Hers is the dreaded right thing personality vacuum. Save me from people who insist on their right thing if YOU are the one making the sacrifices. The world alone takes on a dusty settled landscape in her brain. Sinister thoughts, haunting faces of other people. It is the \"No one knows anyone else if other people don't feel EXACTLY as I feel EXACTLY when I feel like it\" The Sheltering Sky again. Dr. Slade would blow away in the wind. I have less to say about him than his wife. He decided what name she had to go by and she let him. So she could hold it against him later? I guess? They suck that much. The Spider's House feels the estrangement too. The void sky deafens you. You want what you can't have, when you have it you don't want it. Anything to relieve the buried alive of self and other people. Right or wrong is wrong. The gut feeling snake pit is the inescapable, the only life. I thought Bowles knew that and now he threw it away. Slade machinations. Slade helplessness. I don't care what happens to them. Let it Come Down isn't left out of the tracing. Fat tourists bleed into your space, fake smiles of the locals consume you. Go to their houses of glass, fur and leather. You're the faceless legs of the servants. You're the doll in playtime. How did it become their world all the time? I believe in the monster's world. I believed in it like some big bang out of people shit atmospherics in Bowles' short stories. Background is same color as the drapes. This time it is a young and handsome man. His father has a bottomless checkbook. The strings attached chafe the big little rich boy so he keeps a bland yes-man around. The yes-man calls him \"Baby\" for some reason. I thought this was the creepiest part of the book. His sex mirrors for his teenage mistress wasn't as bad as that. Grove/Vero's tape recorder for rehearsed sex plans for the teenager was pretty creepy too. I want some indefinable domination outcome and you had better give it to me, dammit! I wished I wasn't reading the book at all long before then, though. What was in Up Above the World that wasn't in one of his other three novels? Something for money, I guess. There's no conviction. A shit flows with no wind. I wish I hadn't read this one. (Maybe I should believe in it. I didn't stop reading when I was bored from the first few pages.)"}, {"userName": "Jon Ballard", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1200897-jon-ballard", "userReview": "I read this about ten years ago and it remains my favorite novel (\"Let It Come Down,\" also by Bowles, is also in my top five). It is considered a lesser piece of writing by critics of Bowles, and stands firmly in the shadow of what many consider to be his masterpiece, \"The Sheltering Sky.\" While that \"more important\" work is fine, there is something about this so-called minor novel that really struck a chord. It reminds me of something by Patricia Highsmith, in that it's plotted well and throughout its characters are harried, dislocated, always a moment away from making a wrong decision. The ending stayed with me for days and days. Graham Greene used to call some of his novels \"entertainments\" because he saw them as less serious works and wanted to make a distinction between, say, what he was trying to accomplish in \"The Power and the Glory\" versus \"Our Man in Havana.\" I think, too, Bowles saw \"Up Above the World\" in a similar light compared to his other works. But I find the novel beautiful and mysterious, and it's the one I cherish above all others."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/214508-amy", "userReview": "Paul Bowles is fantastic at turning a seemingly banal travel story into something of terror.

One turns to him to read about naivet\u00e9 and innocence crashing against an unyieldingly alien world. It's not impossible to see what was later called Orientalism in his writing, though it's not exactly fair, either. His real concern is not that other cultures are strange to us, inscrutable--though that is there--but that every culture, instead, papers over the true horror: which is that existence itself is an awesome, unknowable, and horrifying mystery, a black chasm one is forced to confront when the shibboleths of innocent comfort are broken.It makes me think of the opening lines of Nabokov's memoir, \"Speak, Memory\": \"The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness. Although the two are identical twins, man, as a rule, views the prenatal abyss with more calm than the one he is heading for (at some forty-five hundred heartbeats an hour).\"This si the story of Day and Taylor, two middle-class Americans on a leisurely travel through South America; they have their own difficulties--Taylor, a doctor, is much older then Day, and they are drifting apart; neither of them are creatures of deep feeling or intellect--who still see themselves protected from the world by money and common sense.Unbeknownst to them, though, they run into something else--and so this seems like a typical Bowles set up. But very soon it is clear he is vamping on his usual theme, pushing it in new directions. Day and Taylor become entangled with a Canadian woman, and then with her estranged son, his too-young mistress, his insecure friend, and the machinations of their lives, their various desires, and petty wants and needs.It is in exploring these three that Bowles does something unusual for him, making the inscrutable world into which the naive must crash explicable. But this is also the book's fault. One wants from Bowles the inscrutability; the recognition that the universe is alien, indifferent if not inhospitable. Instead, we get an extended riff on Soto, the son; Luchita, the mistress; and her son (birthed when Luchita was but 12). Their desires are picayune, though--and so the crashing of the two sets of couples is less about existential horror and more about the operation of banality.Bowles uses some structural tricks to increase the tension, not letting the reader in on certain motivations and actual events for extended periods of time. He also writes extended dream sequences. These, however, cannot paper over the dullness of Soto, Luchita, and their friend; if he was indeed after banality--revealing the alien world to driven by the same greed that shapes Western society, just more baldy put--then he achieved it, but banality does not make for interesting reading.The book is listed at over 200 pages in this edition, but there is a great deal of padding, and it probably clocks in at under 200; even so, the middle section, the one that focused most intently on Soto and Luchita, drags. Bowles can still write, dry and precise sentences, the flat affect implying entire worlds--but the worlds he suggests are themselves uninteresting here.Once the two couples come together in earnest, the tension ratchets up, and the last quarter of the book sings. The dream sequences that came before feel like dry runs for the drugged-out sequences here, but these work well, and he writes about intoxication with both restraint and exactitude.The pay-off is both typically Bowlesian, and also underwhelming. The ending for both Day and Taylor are only implied--horrific, yes, but in part because what happens is not clear at all. There is the reversal, too, Soto thinking he had finally come out on top, his carefully protected life of doing nothing--so that he had the time for whatever improvisations he desired--culminating in his beating the world, only t find himself outmaneuvered, adrift.But the mechanics of it all are . . . well, the word would be banal again. Soto's motivations are greed, which are also the motivations, to varying extents, of his comrades. The dark abyss that surrounds the brief crack of light that is life shows itself to be not terrifying at all, but mundane.Which, as implied, may be what Bowles was after, tacking against the existential and making the case that we are at the mercy of others--others who are driven by the same impulses, but just applied to different ends, which we cannot fully know. The banality had it's point, and Bowles made it palatable.The real horror, he seems to be suggesting, is that there is no horror at all: it is worth than nothingness, worse than the abyss of darkness: it is that little men with cramped motivations make up the entirety of existence."}, {"userName": "Anthony", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1737766-anthony", "userReview": "This imperfect book represents a wish to choose works by authors completely unknown to me. Paul Bowles' world is possibly the literary equivalent of a Hopper painting. The lives depicted are as lonely as a Hopper character staring into the mid-distance from a road side inn. Written in 1966, this work is the possible hinterland for a Hopper character, a dark hallucigenic world in which two rootless middle class drifters appear to wander into a nightmare through simple lack of direction, and apathy. Dr Slade is the 67 year old husband of a much younger woman, Day (short for Desiree) whom we catch as they board a freighter to an unknown South American destination. The fetid damp atmosphere of the tropical place they find themselves in establishes a Conradian exile from which we fear they may not return. The sweat of the jungle is replicated in the sweat of the LSD with which they are involuntarily injected. It is a world that sucks them in and only spits one of them out. More I cannot say without ruining the plot. The language and dialogue is measured and the darkness and oppression ouses. Dr Slade's drugged state is described thus.\"There is a mistake about the time. He in a house, caught in the body of a man who is being kept in bed. People come and bother him, go away. Doors are opened and shut. It is daytime; it is night. Sometimes he is impaled on the wind as he rushes through space. There are long periods when he is imprisoned in a muddy submarine world, aware of the room beyond the bed, knowing that time is creeping past, but able only to lie there without motion, clinging mollusk-like to the underside of the consciousness until someone comes and touches him, and once again changes everything.\""}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "UP ABOVE THE WORLD. (1962). Paul Bowles. ***1/2.An older couple on vacation are about ready to push on to the next stop when they meet a young man and his presumed mistress. They are invited to join them for drinks, and the tourists believe that they have encountered a couple that they can write home about. Meeting people on vacation is not rare, but when there seems to be some chemistry involved, the expectations are high. But things are not what they seem to be. Soon, the tourists take ill and are looked after by the young couple, but the couple is still shrouded in mystery. Paul Bowles usually examines the interactions that take place at the intersection of two cultures. In this eerie story, the border he is focusing on comprises good and evil. Reading this novel, I was drawn into the relationship between the two sets of people, and, for a long time I didn\u2019t know what ws going on. The action of the novel is never explicit. You almost have to use your gut feel to try and follow what is going on. In spite of the shadowy plot, you are forced to move forward with the events in the story. This is Bowles at his finest.

An increasingly terrifying descent into hell, that's what. Shame for them, but what a mesmerizing read this is. The dark jungle inferno awaiting them is rife with fanged black furred creatures; foul smelling, claustrophobic rooms whose exterior patios are lined with spiked fauna too sharp and thick to move through, sudden wrong turns leading to landscapes of grey rubble, empty nothingness stretched out in all directions. Guiding them through all of it is Vero Soto, a local of seemingly vast wealth and elegant charm, befriended somewhat reluctantly by the Slades early on. Smell a bit of trouble? You can't imagine. I promise you. The daylight realities of Up Above the World hold all sorts of illness and dread, but are nothing compared to the streaming nightmares of ghastly illusion; careening-down-the-broken-tunnel-of-stairs dreams, stomach turning acid trip hallucinations, fever induced delirium. Bowles' artistic brilliance is full throttle in these passages, each of them spell-binding, literally. The combination of the tropical locale and evil in the guise of generously proffered luxury is very Patricia Highsmith, from the pleasantries to the (very) nasty bits. Highsmith might well have devised a more satisfactory ending - I'd been working out all sorts of twists and possible resolutions beyond the obvious one, or at least to add on to the primary question of why the Slades are pulled into Soto's orbit to begin with. Particularly I would have liked to have learned more about Luchita, Soto's 17 year old, perpetually stoned 'girlfriend' - it's hard to know what to call her, really - and her 5 year old son, Pepito (Soto, who rarely has a kind word for his lover, maliciously calls Pepito \"the product of your youthful indiscretions\"). But the ending serves well enough. One puts down this book with some regret to be done with it, coupled with the relief of returning to the outside world.

It's an odd story, awkwardly told I find. A couple, the husband a doctor, evidently retired and his much younger wife are taking a cruise and debark at a small town in Spain. To say they are an odd couple is an understatement. There is not the usual communication one would expect in a married couple and this is what partially brings trouble to them.I've only given the beginning bare bones of the story. It takes some extremely unpleasant turns and I have decided that I just don't want to find out what happens. Some books overcome that skin-crawling feeling by beautiful writing, or interesting and complex characters. For me at least, this book doesn't come up to even those standards. I find the writing stilted, and out of date. Which is odd as the copy write is only 1967. Certainly I've read far older books that don't have that \"dated\" feeling.

Bowles\u2019 novels rarely vary from a formula that reflected his own experience as an expatriate writer: American travelers, frequently a couple, face cultural dissonance in a third world country, often leading to a fatal or horrific conclusion. In Up Above the World, a doctor and his wife traveling in Latin America meet an enigmatic stranger who becomes a gracious, if distant host. As unusual and occasionally hallucinatory events unfold, it is unclear whether they are being manipulated and, if so, to what end. Ultimately, the story loses force as some events are explained, but other motivations and actions remain hauntingly indeterminate; Up Above the World is a horror story in the purest sense, where the individual consciousness loses control of routine, familiar sensation, and the comforts of certainty."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/215470-mark", "userReview": "There's something about post-colonial Latin America as a setting.

I've first encountered his novels by reading \nThe Sheltering Sky\n in 2015. I liked his world enough that I decided to pick up his subsequent novels, reading \nLet It Come Down\n and \nThe Spider's House\n. All three novels were set in North Africa, and involved characters that were not easy to like and sympathize with. These novels were all about existential despair, and for some reason, this topic resonated well with me. So I decided to pick up his final novel, Up Above the World. I must say that this final novel is a tad different from the previous three. The characters are still not likable: you have the elderly Dr. Taylor Slade together with his wife, Desiree (Day) Slade, vacationing in an unnamed Central American country. The location is now different, but what is similar is that Bowles still places his main characters in exotic locales where they are out of their element. It's not North Africa anymore, but Central America. Instead of the desert, there's the jungle. Nevertheless, there are things that remain: Bowles still portrays his characters to be snobby bitches, thinking that they are one above the rest. Dr. and Mrs. Slade consider themselves travelers, not tourists. Though to be honest, given what eventually happens to them, they definitely are noobs and could learn a thing or two about traveling and dealing with people in foreign countries. One thing that makes me scratch my head this time is the presence of a villain, in the form of Grove Soto. This man is a charming and young fellow who befriends the Slades, with nothing but evil in his mind. This I believe is something new: in the previous three novels, there was no real villain per se. The main characters were all destroyed by their environments, and by the fact that they simply were too naive for their own good. This time, there is an actual character in the book who seeks to destroy the two naive and desperate main characters. I must say that as much as this book has all the signs of being a Bowles novel, it is slightly different from his more popular works, and as such I find it hard to recommend as an introductory book for Bowles. If one wants to begin reading Bowles, I would recommend his other books first. In fact, I would even go as far as saying that this book was a little hard to follow, and I definitely would have a more negative opinion of it if not for the fact that I am already a Bowles fan. There is actually a section in the middle where I was completely thrown off, having a hard time figuring out the continuity of events. Then again maybe Bowles was trying to simulate the effects of amnesia, given that amnesia is a very important plot device in this book. I am a Bowles fan, and therefore I would still rate this high, giving 4 out of 5 stars. Nevertheless, this is the odd one out, so to speak. I am rating it rather high because it gives me completion, and there's no denying that Bowles' style is very evident in this one. But it takes some background information for one to actually appreciate this book, and therefore it is not as accessible as the others. If you want to read this one, I suggest not picking it up unless you've read one of his other books first.See my other book reviews here."}, {"userName": "Kris Mazza", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49087817-kris-mazza", "userReview": "COuldnt even finish it"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3436247-carol", "userReview": "Disjointed and confusing; a tad boring."}, {"userName": "Vel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2644615-vel", "userReview": "Only in a couple of passages does the old man remind us of his more vibrant days."}, {"userName": "Phil Syphe", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20436649-phil-syphe", "userReview": "Read this as part of my MA degree.

I was annoyed and disappointed that the story little resembles the description on the back (or on this site), since the synopsis itself was intriguing. The narrative is choppy, and switching perspectives between 4 or 5 equally unsympathetic characters does little to involve me as a reader. The dialogue and characterization is sometimes clumsy as well. The ending twist is rather fantastic and implausible, but it has me considering a re-read for the near future, in order to garner all of the subtle conversational clues that are sprinkled throughout the narrative. But still, there is something about the book (and Bowles' style) that is simply hypnotic. The man sets a tone like few I have seen, and he's a master at narrating subtle shifts in mood and psychology among his characters. I really love how he introduces each new setting with a paragraph or two of description, hitting upon the sights, sounds, and smells, just masterful. A sense of despair, disconnect and supreme isolation permeates both of the Bowles books I have read. You wonder why his characters can't just be straight with one another, and air out their grievances.

Cientos de p\u00e1ginas de sufrimiento y estr\u00e9s para llegar a un final tr\u00e1gico y doloroso. Lo \u00fanico que tengo que decir es que cuando me dicen que el libro que tengo en las manos es del g\u00e9nero \"negro\", lo que hago es soltarlo como si de repente su temperatura hubiera subido varios grados cent\u00ed\u00adgrados.En cuanto a la pel\u00ed\u00adcula: tengo que decir que tampoco me gust\u00f3, que me pareci\u00f3 estresante y dolorosa. Creo haber le\u00ed\u00addo la novela tambi\u00e9n, pero realmente no estoy segura y no quiero acordarme. Me le\u00ed\u00ad el libro de Bowles porque mi enamorado de aquella \u00e9poca lo hab\u00ed\u00ada comprado, y yo no sab\u00ed\u00ada de qu\u00e9 iba eso del genero negro. Adem\u00e1\u00a1s el caballero me dijo que la peli era maravillosa y todo el rollo... en fin, a ese joven le gustaban los ambientes s\u00f3rdidos, y por eso le falt\u00f3 tiempo para echarme..."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/150446-ed", "userReview": "American expatriate author (and composer) Paul Bowles's greatest novel, The Sheltering Sky, written in 1949, was followed in 1966 by this book, \"Up above the World\". Similar in structure, tone, and subject, \"Up above the World\" was reprinted in this 1982 edition by the Ecco Press as one of the great neglected books of the 20th century. (The Modern Library placed it at No. 97 in its list of the 100 greatest books of the 20th century.) Like \"Sky\", it is a dark work with building tension set in what we would now call a Third World country (but in Central America rather than the North Africa of \"Sky\".) In his 1966 New York Times review, Conrad Knickerbocker notes that in \"Up above the World\" \"we see how a first-rate writer goes about creating the environment of menace. And Mr. Bowles's theme, the destruction of innocence, is defined, if not resolved, with an ability that once more confirms his stature.\"\"Up above the World\" was easily deserves a goodreads.com five-star rating.
