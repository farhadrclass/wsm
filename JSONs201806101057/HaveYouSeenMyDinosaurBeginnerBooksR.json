The author tells this story in verse, in a similar rhyming pattern of most Doctor Seuss books; e.g., \u201cHe sometimes likes a little drink. So have you seen him in the sink?\" The illustrations done by Joe Mathieu contain brilliant, bright colors and are quite humorous; as is seen in the aforementioned scene with the child\u2019s dinosaur hiding under the kitchen sink cabinet and sneaking a drink of water, while the little boy and his mother's backs are turned. Joe Mathieu's illustrations add so much dimension and enjoyment to the author\u2019s clever, funny, and adorable story. This children\u2019s book is more contemporary than other Doctor Seuss books, as it takes the little boy to a zoo where he learns about zoo animals and far off places, such as Bhutan and East Timor. The comedy in the story's plot is seen throughout the story; e.g., when this little child decides to approach a college professor to get his input as to where a dinosaur might go, and Professor Pew suggests a big museum; to which the naive little guy replies: \u201cIs this the place where, people say, a dinosaur is on display?\u201d After searching high and low, the author draws the reader into the story by having the boy ask the viewer if he/she has seen his dinosaur. Have You Seen My Dinosaur? allows the reader to understand the importance of the author's narrative and the illustrator's artistry to work in unison, complementing one another; as this is essential for them to present a book that is fascinating, appealing, and considered worth reading.Teachers can use Have You Seen My Dinosaur as a teaching tool to help expand students' literacy skills. This is an excellent book selection for young readers as its composition and style of writing will help to instill confidence in students as they recite repetitive words. Reading rhyming text, such as this, also makes reading more enjoyable for children and helps them to develop a love for literature. This style of book also helps students to increase their vocabulary skills, because children tend to retain what interests and humors them. Students will greatly enjoy participating in different class projects based on this story, such as performing a play or doing an art project depicting their favorite scenes. Using E-books in the classroom is a wonderful tool for reaching students in various ways. E-books allow teachers opportunities to teach the entire class with everyone being able to view a particular book. E-readers can enable teachers to \u201cmix it up,\u201d making reading more fun through the use of technology. E-books better hold students' attention, which helps them to develop a love for reading; and they may better reach students with attention difficulties and English language learners."}, {"userName": "Ashleigh", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34369002-ashleigh", "userReview": "Have you Seen My Dinosaur?

Also, while stretching our mind while looking for the dinosaur we see, ocelot, gnu, kinkajou (google search activated). More Google searches for me..even though it is an early kids reader. We are lead from the pictures that there is a true, real dinosaur, but all the other people point out facts like dinosaurs aren't alive any more.
