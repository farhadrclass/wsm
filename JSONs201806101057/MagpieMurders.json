It is structured to contain a novel within a novel. This means there is more than one mystery at play. Susan Ryeland is in her forties, in a relationship with Andreas and an editor at Cloverleaf Books, the publishers. She is settling down to read the latest manuscript of the Atticus series from Alan Conway set in the 1950s. Atticus is a German refugee, who has assisted the police in a number of murder cases. He has an assistant, James Fraser, and is dying from terminal cancer. This is to be his last case.Atticus finds himself in Saxby on Avon, helping Inspector Raymond Chubb in what appears to be two murders, a cleaning woman, Mary Blakiston, and the beheading of Sir Magnus at Pye Hall. As you would expect, there are a host of suspects ranging from the vicar to the sister of Magnus, Clarissa. Mary Blakiston is a busybody who made herself privy to the secrets of many in the village. Magnus is loathed, and he has sanctioned the development of Dingle Dell which has created uproar locally. Atticus uncovers a web of deceit, fraud, and secrets galore. However, he is at the point of declaring the murderer when the manuscript ends and there are 3 missing chapters. And to top it all, the author, Alan Conway, is discovered dead, apparently having committed suicide. Cloverleaf Books is in serious financial straits and Alan is their cash cow. Susan soon becomes convinced that Alan has been murdered. Susan turns amateur detective and goes in search of the missing chapters and Alan's murderer. She finds numerous connections between the Atticus novel, for example, Alan was also dying. There are a variety of cryptic clues and references to tube stations, Agatha Christie novels and so much more, in the Atticus manuscript. Alan is an unlikeable character and many have possible motives to kill him. Susan cannot find the missing chapters and concludes that they must contain clues to Alan's killer. Susan cannot help getting drawn deeper into investigating the mysteries but loses track of the fact there is a dangerous killer on the loose. All three mysteries are resolved simultaneously. We discover where the final chapters are and who killed Magnus and Alan.This is a stunning novel from Anthony Horowitz. Those who adore the Golden Age of classic crime novels will love this. It is brilliantly plotted to give us a double helping of crime. Absolutely wonderful. I have no hesitation in recommending this book. Many thanks to Orion Books for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "The Magpie Murders by Anthony Horowitz is a 2017 Harper publication. Shrewd, cunning, intelligent, and ingenious! I love the golden age of mysteries, but, of course, I also love present -day mysteries, too. This book gave me both of those things in one novel! How is this for a setup? Susan Ryeland is an editor for Cloverleaf Books. She plans to spend her weekend reading the manuscript of Alan Conway\u2019s latest Atticus Pudd mystery, entitled \u2018Magpie Murders\u2019. The reader is allowed to read along with Susan, and pretty soon I found myself enjoying an absorbing historical mystery, set in the mid-fifties, the style of which bears a strong resemblance to that of Agatha Christie. But, just as the murderer is about to be revealed, Susan makes the horrific discovery that the last few chapters of the manuscript were not included. In fact, they are missing!! If that weren\u2019t bad enough, she soon hears that Alan Conway is dead, after allegedly committing suicide. It is more imperative than ever that Susan finds those missing chapters, because Cloverleaf Books\u2019 livelihood depends on it. Her inquires soon leads her to realize \u2018Magpie Murders\u2019 holds the clue to why Alan Conway, died, and to where those the missing chapters are. To solve the true crime mystery of Alan\u2019s death, and discover the solution to the \u2018Magpie Murders\u2019, she turns amateur detective, hoping to not only solve a crime, but hopefully, keep her publishing house afloat and save her job. One for sorrow,Two for joy,Three for a girl,Four for a boy,Five for silver,Six for gold,Seven for a secret,Never to be told.Mysteries are my first love. I read mysteries long before I dabbled in horror, or fell in love with romance novels. I love experiencing new authors and frequently dabble in various genres and sub-genres, but I rarely ever go more than a week without reading a crime novel of some kind. However, reading numerous crime stories for so many years has a few drawbacks too, because now I have learned the various formulas, devices, tactics and familiar plotlines, used by authors within this genre, meaning I can often puzzle out \u2018whodunit\u2019, although I may not have worked out the finer points.  This \u2018occupational hazard\u2019, if you will, keeps me on the lookout for a book or an author that can challenge me, give my brain a good workout, keep me guessing, and stun me with that \u2018gotcha\u2019 moment. This book did all that, and kept me thoroughly entertained from start to finish, plus, I got not one, but two mysteries, which are cleverly intertwined. Okay, frame stories aren\u2019t exactly new, but this one is genius, I tell you, genius!! The story is chock full of details, anagrams, parallels, and crafty twists, and occasionally a bit of humor or an inside joke. It is perfect for even the most jaded mystery reader, and will certainly keep you on your toes. Despite the slightly expanded length, the story is very fast paced and hard to put down, even though I wanted to savor it as long as possible. Needless, to say, fans of golden age mysteries will not want to miss this one, but any and all mystery lovers should give this one a try. I don\u2019t think you will be disappointed. 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Glenn Russell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23385697-glenn-russell", "userReview": "\u201cAs far as I'm concerned, you can't beat a good whodunnit: the twists & turns, the clues and the red herrings and then, finally, the satisfaction of having everything explained to you in a way that makes you kick yourself because you hadn't seen it from the start.\u201d\u2015 Anthony Horowitz, Magpie Murders I'm no fan of whodunits. I've never read anything by Agatha Christie, P. D. James, Dorothy L. Sayers or Ellery Queen; not even Conan Doyle. Nor have I ever seen a film based on a whodunit. Detective stories and murder mysteries are simply not my taste. However, I decided to listen to the audio book of Magpie Murders since the book is about much more than a murder mystery - this is a novel focusing on what it means for an author to be a writer of murder mysteries. More exactly, Magpie Murders explores a number of relationships and connections for mystery writers - to note just three: between author and audience, between author and the author's prime creation, the detective, between author and the author's overarching literary vision and self-identity as a writer.Expanding to wider horizons, from murder mystery to philosophic and literary questions surrounding murder mysteries and their authors, Anthony Horowitz has propelled himself out into the postmodern metafictional universe of such as John Barth, Donald Barthelme and Robert Coover. Thus my interest. A word about Anthony Horowitz. In interviews this vivacious and charming British author comes across as someone who would make a most enjoyable dinner companion, exactly the type of person a university would love to visit campus to give a talk to students on what it means to immerse oneself in literature and dedicate years to writing. He is also clear about his love for whodunits and writers such as Agatha Christie, Conan Doyle, Ian Fleming and Ellery Queen. And as Mr. Horowitz states directly \u2013 both as a person and a writer, he's exactly the opposite of complete bastard Alan Conway portrayed in Magpie Murders.Turning to Alan Conway, we have a man who aspired to write literary fiction, to join the ranks of leading contemporary British authors such as Salman Rushdie, Martin Amis, David Mitchell and Will Self. But, alas, his serious efforts where tossed back in his face with rejection slips. Knowing Alan to be an exceptionally talented writer, his wife at the time suggested he write a popular detective novel. Alan did just that. Money and fame gushed in, enough money Alan could finally quit his dreaded teaching job and enough fame the publishing industry and the public clamored for more whodunits featuring Alan\u2019s phenomenal Inspector Atticus P\u00fcnd, a detective right up there with the immortals, a detective to be mentioned in the same breath with Sherlock Holmes.But money and fame came with a price: Alan Conway had to abandon his dreams of becoming a serious literary writer, another Salman Rushdie or Martin Amis. And the more whodunits he wrote, the more his readers and publisher demanded even more Atticus P\u00fcnd. Alan responds: Very well, if all you people want your silly whodunits featuring Inspector Atticus P\u00fcnd you will have them. All nine volumes. I\u2019ll have my revenge at the end when I reveal to the world the buried code, an anagram constructed from the titles of those nine volumes I wrote for you, the hidden message: your dear Atticus P\u00fcnd, hero of heroes, mastermind of masterminds, is nothing more than a piffling poopstick (my term; Alan Conway's term is more offensive). At this point we can ask: Why does Alan Conway judge Atticus P\u00fcnd a dunce? P\u00fcnd is an exceptional detective and wants to continue his detective work right up to the time of his death. What\u2019s wrong with that? First, let us turn to the following quote from the nineteenth century German philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer: \u201cThe wise man will, above all, strive after freedom from pain and annoyance, quiet and leisure, consequently a tranquil, modest life, with as few encounters as may be; and so, after a little experience of his so-called fellowmen, he will elect to live in retirement, or even, if he is a man of great intellect, in solitude. For the more a man has in himself, the less he will want from other people,--the less, indeed, other people can be to him.\u201d Perhaps it is Alan Conway\u2019s observation that Atticus P\u00fcnd, a man aware of his impending death in a matter of weeks, is incapable of solitude and deep contemplation and thus clings to his need to play his role as detective to crack the case. And maybe Conway is extending such a immature clinging to an entire population incapable of moving on from their superficial reading of whodunits. Another equally valid reason harkens back to Alan Conway\u2019s childhood. As we learn from his sister who grew up with him, her brother was a victim of child abuse \u2013 abused both physically and emotionally as a youngster, much of the abuse coming in the form of repeated canings at a boarding school. Beating children was both socially acceptable and legal at the time (such punishment in England was not outlawed until 1999). To compound the problem, Alan\u2019s abuse was at the hands of the headmaster who also happened to be his father. Now that\u2019s an explosive combination that can\u2019t be discounted or downplayed. Having had such an abusive childhood and then being compelled to write about a detective rounding up clues in quaint English villages, it isn\u2019t hard to imagine Alan Conway seething with rage at his writing desk as he pumped out whodunits, all the while his heart and creative spirit craving to write Will Self-like biting cynicism and caustic social commentary. We can picture the author fuming: \u201cNo, not this prison. I\u2019m trapped by readers and the publishing industry \u2013 I can only write these trite detective mysteries. This is disgusting.\u201dQuestions worthy of consideration as we read The Magpie Murders: What does it mean for an author\u2019s identity to be inextricably entwined with whodunits and their detective? How bound is an author of murder mysteries by the public \u2013 their publisher, the media, their readers? How does their success impact their vision and personal integrity as literary artist and creator? Thank you, Anthony Horowitz, for stepping out to the metafictional land of Robert Coover and John Barth to ask such questions.

Books add warmth and depth and I take comfort in their company and the ever changing displays of them that litter my home. \u00a0But even I have to acknowledge all the benefits of today\u2019s E readers. \u00a0I am often compelled to have a book right away, even when I know I may not get to it for a while. \u00a0I love knowing that it is right there, easily available when I am ready. \u00a0Digital makes that so easy and fast and compact. \u00a0I have hundreds of books on a device that takes up less room than one hard copy. And I can read it anywhere at any time of day or night, regardless of lighting and it travels like a true champion. Oh my goodness I do love books, in all shapes, styles and configurations. \u00a0I have a soft trade copy of Magpie Murders, with a black and red cover and ruffled pages. \u00a0It lay itself wide open for my reading pleasure throughout. I love that! \u00a0\u00a0In this story Horowitz pays homage to Agatha Christie and his work is brilliant. \u00a0It is the kind of story that you know right from the get go that you can settle into and get comfortable. \u00a0All will be revealed in due course. \u00a0It is actually two mysteries, one nested into another and even though I was annoyed and impatient when I got pulled away from Atticus Pund, I soon found myself lost in another story and equally reluctant to let go. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Horowitz delivers on both counts and had me more than once turning back the pages and scratching my head. \u00a0I loved it! \u00a0Up next\u2026\u2026..Moriarty"}, {"userName": "Annet", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166369-annet", "userReview": "It's one thing reading about detectives, quite another trying to be one....

In a world full of uncertainties, is it not inherently satisfying to come to the last page with every i dotted and every t crossed? The stories mimic our experience in the world. We are surrounded by tensions and ambiguities, which we spend half our life trying to resolve, and we\u2019ll probably be on our own deathbed when we reach that moment when everything makes sense. Just about every whodunnit provides that pleasure. It is the reason for their existence.\u201d The story begins with Susan Ryeland, editor at a small publishing company, reading the Magpie Murders, which is latest book in the popular Atticus Pund mystery series written by Allan Conway. Susan lets the reader know that reading the manuscript caused her to lose friends and changed her life forever. The narrative then shifts into \u201cConway's\u201d the Magpie Murders, which pays homage to great whodunnit authors, books, and detectives: Christie/Poirot, Conan Doyle/Holmes, etc. Once Susan is finished reading the manuscript, the reader is jolted back into Susan\u2019s story where we discover the manuscript is incomplete and Conway has died. Susan now must track down the missing chapters, which leads into yet another mystery. This book crosses the boundary between writer and reader, and allows the reader to come into the book andd play a part in the detective game. \u201cYou must know that feeling when it\u2019s raining outside and the heating\u2019s on and you lose yourseflf, utterly, in a book. You read and you read and you feel the pages slipping through your fingers until suddenly there are fewer in your right hand than there are in your left and you want to slow down but you still hurtle on towards a conclusion you can hardly bear to discover.

My ThoughtsI really loved the first book. I really am not into who-dun its but took the plunge when I saw all the raving reviews. This book was very clever. It had two books in one book. I was turning the pages quickly in the first mystery. It hooked me in and I kept guessing who the murderer was.Now the second book kind of bored me. I enjoyed it but I really wasn't drawn into it like I was in the first book. I know I am not a who-dun-it fan so my expectations were low to begin with. I did enjoy it, but it was not really a thriller, which I love. I did think that the first book was a mystery and a thriller but the second book I felt was just a mystery.

It would appeal not only to mystery fans, but also to lovers of literary writing and book worshippers in general. A novel nested within another, Magpie Murders is a real page-turner; and I would be hard-pressed to say which thread I loved more \u2013 that of private detective Atticus P\u00fcnd or of Susan Ryeland, editor at Cloverleaf Books. The way Horowitz manages to weave together the two threads is impressive really; just as you are pulled out of one narrative to jump into the other, you will be left gasping but just as thrilled to be caught up in the next. The characters are very well-drawn and the two mysteries contain plenty of suspects to keep you guessing. I changed my mind constantly regarding the true culprit(s) \u2013 everyone seemed to have the perfect motive for murder! I adored Atticus P\u00fcnd, despite the fact his creator seemed to harbor such contempt for him. He may remind you of other beloved literary detectives if you are familiar with the genre. A Holocaust survivor, Atticus has both a realistic as well as a somewhat guarded view of the world around him. \"\u2026 there was something about the pace of change that concerned him, the sudden onrush of machines in every shape and size. As televisions, typewriters, fridges and washing machines became more ubiquitous, as even the fields became crowded with electric pylons, he sometimes wondered if there might not be hidden costs for a humanity that had already been sorely tested in his lifetime. Nazism, after all, had been a machine in itself. He was in no rush to join the new technological age.\" Susan Ryeland is equally likable; she speaks to the reader in each of us with her love of books. \"I had far too many books, of course. Every inch of shelf space was taken. There were books on top of books. The shelves themselves were bending under the weight.\" Who can\u2019t relate to that problem?! I\u2019m not going to give you any further plot details; you absolutely have to read it for yourself in order to fully appreciate the ingenuity to be revealed once you crack open this book.

Magpie Murders is a 5-star, thoroughly entertaining read. Highly recommended.\"I\u2019m not sure it actually matters what we read.

Magpie Murders, one of the mysteries is the 9th in a series by author Alan Conway. The series features the protagonist Atticus P\u00fcnd. Series characters often pay the bills yet many authors including the fictitious Conway have grown sick of their character and could easily kill him off if their fans would only let them. Like others before him Conway is joined at the hip to his character, the proverbial ball and chain. Conway has other stories he\u2019d like to pursue if only. Even Christie grew tired of Poirot and called him\u2018A detestable, bombastic, tiresome, egocentric little creep.\u2019This judgment fit Conway\u2019s sentiments of P\u00fcnd perfectly.Magpie Murders has got it all; murder, mayhem, red herrings, clues, codes, logistical solving, and a huge pool of suspects to choose from.Anthony Horowitz has a field day with his audience paying homage to many famous writers in the mystery genre. Think Christie, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, H.E. McNeile, Sayers, and Dickens and their characters, Poirot, Miss Marple, Sherlock, Drummond, Sir Peter Wimsy and Drood to name just a few.I postponed reading the ending of Magpie Murders to see if I could put the pieces together.

I adore vintage crime novels and, having read this, I feel that Horowitz has done an excellent job in combining the fun of those mysteries with a more modern take.The story begins in present day London, with Susan Ryeland, Head of Fiction at Cloverleaf Books, about to read the latest Atticus Punt mystery by their bestselling author, Alan Conway. Although Susan does not get along with Alan, she loves his novels and is looking forward to reading his latest. Horowitz cleverly uses this device to tell a mystery within a mystery, as we read the novel that Susan sits down to read, alongside her. The story of her Poirot like detective, Atticus Punt; a German who survived the war and is now a private investigator in 1950\u2019s England, who is asked to investigate the death of a local village busy-body.Having finished the book, Susan discovers the ending is missing and, almost at the same time, she discovers that Alan Conway has died. Like his fictional character, Conway had discovered he had a terminal illness and ended his life \u2013 or did he? As Susan sets out to try to discover the missing chapters of the last Atticus Punt mystery, \u201cMagpie Murders,\u201d she realises there are real life parallels between the novel and Conway\u2019s life, as well as links between his death and the mystery. This really is a very enjoyable read. I loved the character of Susan Ryeland and thought she was a realistic amateur investigator. Meanwhile, the two mysteries coincide cleverly, so the author manages to give us both endings almost in tandem. This is very much a loving look at Golden Age detective fiction. Horowitz allows his fictional author, Alan Conway, to utilise a lot of Agatha Christie in his book, while also using puzzles and cryptic clues as devices in the modern version of the storyline. I really do hope that this is not just a standalone novel \u2013 Anthony Horowitz has done something very clever and it works very well, but I would love to see Susan Ryeland return in another mystery.

And I mean to the *very* end (I'm a bit rusty on the murder mysteries). When this one came out, I was intrigued immediately. That cover just draws you in. It was selected by a big group of lovely ladies for our Traveling Sisters read, which made this one even more fun to guess along the way and compare notes.A tip for readers...don't read reviews on this book (as she writes this in her review, huh)! Go into it not knowing anything other than you will be delighted with this murder mystery. So many reviews tell too much about the story and I think it can ruin the enjoyment of the book. I will not do that, but instead I will say this, Susan Ryeland is an editor who is given the manuscript of Alan Conway\u2019s latest novel to read/edit. It can be confusing because you are reading a book about a person reading a book within the story. But it all comes together so brilliantly. There is a special nod to Agatha Christie in this one which is perfect for fans of her writing. I listened to the audio and ended up loving it, the multiple narrators did a fabulous job. For audio fans, British accents but very easy to understand. At first, I was so confused listening....remember you are reading a book about a person reading a book within the story. I listened to about 20 mins, confused, went to beginning, and started again. There were no chapter marks for the book so I had difficulty in figuring out where I was. It's all due to the story - the book within the book. The Traveling Sisters with the print version said the page numbers were also confusing, all over the place. So I just went with the flow and enjoyed it until the end.A fun read for fans of 'whodunits', one for fans of Agatha Christie, and I would say for audio fans too, just stick with it.

The title also alludes to Agatha Christie\u2019s love of nursery rhyme structures, with chapters based on \u201cOne for Sorrow,\u201d about magpies.It becomes immediately apparent that Mr. Horowitz\u2019s novel is highly inspired by Agatha Christy and her oeuvre.

Truth be told I almost gave up on the book two or three times within the first sixty or seventy pages as there was not much to draw me in.

I\u2019m not sure why since I\u2019ve never read a whodunnit novel or watched a whodunnit series. It\u2019s an instinctive thing. So I thought the time had come to investigate my instinctive indifference. This version of the genre attracted me because of the meta fiction angle \u2013 the story within the story structure. An easy way of evaluating any novel is to compare the time consumed reading it and the nourishment received. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t say this emerged from this test with a very high rating. It\u2019s entertaining but it\u2019s also very very long. About the size of Anna Karenina, in fact. I quite enjoyed the first narrative but began to get a bit bored and irritated when I had to go through the whole thing again. Paul Auster\u2019s 4321 showed me retelling the same story in a different literary dimension is a difficult trick to pull off. For me, Horowitz only half pulled it off. The second narrative did interest me but I had soon lost interest in the puzzles of the first narrative. Soon I realised I didn\u2019t much care who had killed Sir Magnus Pye. The final straw was when the narrator wants me to read a long excerpt from a fictional author\u2019s novel and compare it with an extract from an unpublished author\u2019s manuscript for signs of plagiarism. I skipped it. Once I\u2019ve skipped even a sentence in a novel I\u2019m reading it triggers a willingness, even an eagerness to skip whole passages. But then I have little interest in sleuthing. In some ways whodunnits are like crossword puzzles \u2013 too welded and tidy for my liking. Lots of clues are coded into the text using anagrams and allusions to famous whodunnit authors. Again of little interest to me, I\u2019m afraid. And, of course, red herrings abound. There were some interesting musings on the nature of the whodunnit genre, most of all regarding its status as light entertainment rather than serious literature. One problem I had, is that in whodunnits people seem to murder their victims for essentially flimsy and implausible reasons. As if I murdered my window cleaner because he always deliberately missed two of my windows. All this said I reckon if you love whodunnits you\u2019ll love this because essentially it\u2019s very well constructed. And I did find it fascinating as a concept, perhaps unique to whodunnits, how to some extent the detective does your reading for you. However I think I will be sticking to the occasional game of Cluedo and continuing to ignore every crossword puzzle I come across."}, {"userName": "Brenda - Traveling Sister ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10841164-brenda---traveling-sister", "userReview": "Traveling Sister Group Read with Norma, Lindsay, Susanne, JanB, Holly, Linda, Jaline and PorshaJoWe read Magpie Murders with seven of our Traveling Sisters and it brought out one of the best and most fun group discussions we have had yet. For this one, we tried to stay as close as we could to each other with our reading goals so we could play detectives together and discuss our suspicions along the way. For some of us, it was really hard to put this one down but it sure was worth it staying somewhat close together for the discussions. Magpie Murders is a brilliant, hugely enjoyable, fun, and delightful well-plotted intriguing Golden Age style mystery inside a mystery that is done exceptionally well. A fantastic playful whodunit with satisfying twists and turns and many red herrings for us to ponder and discuss with our Traveling Sisters. Anthony Horowitz does such a fantastic job here with all the characters and they are so well developed. Some quirky, some cunning, some likable, and some not so much and some we grew to like. All very interesting and compelling to read. We all loved the setting and the atmosphere of the small, quaint English Village where everyone knows everyone and everyone has a secret.We really enjoyed sharing clues, our suspicions, red herrings and keeping track of the suspects. Two sisters really doing a great job keeping us on track with the suspects. We all tried to pay close attention to one another to pick up on those clues and information to piece this mystery together. One sister picking up a clue not knowing for what and we all were very surprised at how that fitted into the mystery. We were discussing the clues without even realizing they were clues. We suspected everyone and no one with all the red herrings in this one. This made for such a fun and delightful reading experience. The ending like every good whodunit which was wrapped up nicely with no loose ends and we all were satisfied with it in the end. However, one character did have us discussing how we felt about how the story wrapped up for her and we were split on how we felt about that and it brought out a bit of a discussion for us. This is such a good choice for a group read or works really well if you so choose to read it on your own. We suggest grabbing your favorite beverage and curling up in your comfy chair and getting lost in this brilliant absorbing golden age mystery within a mystery for a few hours. It will be a favorite for some us and a favorite sister read for Brenda and Norma.

Which isn't true. I'm a reader who has spent many an hour, an afternoon, a nail biting binge read, with excellent mysteries by the greatest (Christie, P.D. James, Sayers, and more). You read and you read and you feel the pages slipping through your fingers until suddenly there are fewer in your right hand than there are in your left and you want to slow down but you still hurtle on towards a conclusion you can hardly bear to discover.But this book is unique, and that's why it is more than a mystery novel. True, a mystery novel is at the heart of this book. \"Magpie Murders\" is the latest book by fictional author Alan Conway. The mystery is encased in another story, a bookending story told by Conway's editor that links real life with the characters in Conway's cozy yet murderous English village. Anthony Horowitz is so good. For the first half of this book he hooked me into the world of Saxby-on-Avon, where a meddling housekeeper suffers a fatal fall, and death is restless with the nasty Sir Magnus Pye giving a multitude of suspects reasons to bump him off. Then, we are jerked out of the story at a most inopportune moment, linking fiction with meta fiction. The world of the cozy mystery is oddly linked with the literary world of writers, publishers, editors, and... murder. I loved the homage to Agatha Christie. I also thoroughly enjoyed the references to many writers such as Graham Greene, Ian McEwan, and Conan Doyle. Even Mathew Prichard (grandson to Dame Agatha) has a cameo. And Horowitz makes an appearance (much like Graeme Macrae Burnet did in His Bloody Project) at the end, which I found playful and tongue in cheek.The book is just as much about murder as it is about a writer's ego, and the stigma the mystery genre has endured from readers and writers alike. It's a celebration of the Golden Age mystery, the devices that make it work, and why we keep coming back for more."}, {"userName": "Malia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953660-malia", "userReview": "4.5 stars\u201cYou'd have thought that after twenty years editing murder mysteries I'd have noticed when I found myself in the middle of one.\u201d\u2015 Anthony Horowitz, Magpie MurdersI had heard so much about this Magpie Murders that my expectations were quite high when I finally picked it up. I didn't really know what to expect, but Horowitz is the man behind two of my favorite mystery series - Midsomer Murders and Foyle's War - that I was quite willing to take a chance on him.Magpie Murders presents a story in a story, a device I often enjoy. It begins with editor Susan Ryeland who has received the final manuscript of a popular mystery series starring detective Atticus P\u00fcnd (not very subtly reminiscent of Hercule Poirot;-) Then comes the novel itself and it is quite a good little Golden Age caper. P\u00fcnd is an intriguing character and the mystery is clever. Then something happens (not spoilers here!) and Susan finds herself in the middle of a very real mystery.I enjoyed the dual parts of this novel, and Horowitz is a clever, truly eloquent writer who is able to capture different voices and settings with apparent ease. Susan was a well-developed character and so was the (even more fictional?) Atticus P\u00fcnd. As a fan of Agatha Christie, as well as lots of contemporary authors of crime fiction, this novel was very satisfying. Though it was slower than I anticipated, I got used to this pace and it worked well with the atmosphere of the story. Magpie Murders is about more than just a mystery. It is about its characters, which is the type of novel I like best. Susan felt very real to me, and even P\u00fcnd, essentially a caricature, was fleshed out. Owing, perhaps, to his career in television, I kept thinking this would make for a good TV series or even a film as well, so I will keep an eye out for the inevitable announcement.

Here's how it works:Susan Ryeland, a fiction editor at London's 'Cloverleaf Books', is reading the manuscript of 'Magpie Murders' - the ninth book in Alan Conway's Atticus P\u00fcnd mystery series. P\u00fcnd - a fictional private detective inspired by Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot - is a German Holocaust survivor who lives and works in England. Conway's Atticus P\u00fcnd books have been Cloverleaf's bread-and-butter.....and have even been optioned for a television show. Thus, Susan has high hopes for Magpie Murders. The only downside to the successful series is the author himself, who's not Susan's favorite person. **********Alan Conway's 'Magpie Murders' ManuscriptThe plot of Magpie Murders, set in 1955, involves two deaths at Pye Hall - the manor house in the village of Saxby-on-Avon. The first fatality is Mary Blakiston, Pye Hall's housekeeper, who dies from a fall down the stairs. Mary had a tragic history: her teenage son Tom drowned many years ago, after which her husband left for good. Mary then clung tightly to her remaining son, Robert, who chafed under Mary's smothering attention. Robert left home as soon as he could, and works as an auto mechanic at the local garage. Mary and Robert have a fractious relationship.....and had a big, public argument shortly before Mary died. In Saxby-on-Avon Mary was known as a do-gooder, always helping at church and lending her neighbors a hand. However, Mary was also the town busybody, who stuck her nose into everybody's business.....and learned people's secrets. Mary's death is officially ruled an accident, but local scuttlebutt suggests foul play.....and there are whispers about Robert pushing his mother down the stairs. This disturbs Robert's fianc\u00e9e, Joy Sanderling, who travels to London to ask Atticus P\u00fcnd to 'clear Robert's name.' However P\u00fcnd - who has a terminal illness - declines to help. A few days later, Sir Magnus Pye, the owner of Pye Manor, is killed in his front hall....beheaded with a sword! When P\u00fcnd hears of this development he changes his mind and - with his assistant James Fraser - journeys to Saxby-on-Avon to help Inspector Chubb investigate the recent deaths. It turns out that Sir Magnus was a haughty, diffcult man who planned to sell a tree-filled copse, called Dingle Dell, to building developers.....a move universally opposed by the townsfolk. As in all cozy mysteries, there's a handy group of suspects for the possible murder of Mary, and the definite  murder of Sir Magnus. These include Sir Magnus's disenfranchised sister; his cheating wife; the vicar and his spouse; the doctor; the cleaning lady; Mary's estranged husband; and so on.Pund and Chubb question persons of interest, collect clues, speculate about this and that.....and P\u00fcnd eventually reaches a conclusion.*********Editor Susan Ryeland is about to read the final chapters of Magpie Murders - where P\u00fcnd reveals all - when she realizes the last section of the manuscript is missing. Susan calls her boss, Charles Clover, whose copy of the book is also incomplete. This shouldn't be an insurmountable problem. Susan can just contact the author, Alan Conway, and ask for the missing pages. Except that Conway has committed suicide! Susan looks for the lost chapters in Conway's home and office - and reaches out to his sister and other loved ones - but can't find the book's finale. This is a potential disaster for Cloverleaf Books, which depends on the megabucks generated by the Atticus P\u00fcnd novels. Susan continues to search and learns that - like his character, Atticus P\u00fcnd - Conway was seriously ill. This could be a reason for his suicide. However, Alan's sister insists that the writer would NEVER take his own life. Moreover, Conway's diary reveals that he made plans and appointments for the days following his death. Thinking it all over, Susan concludes that Conway was murdered, and that his death is connected to the missing pages of Magpie Murders. Thus Susan decides she'll track down the killer AND locate the vanished chapters. Lo and behold, a new amateur sleuth is born!As before, there's a ready set of suspects for Alan's demise, including: his ex-wife; his boyfriend; a would-be writer who thinks Alan stole his idea; Conway's former colleagues; the producer who optioned the Atticus P\u00fcnd books for TV; and other folks acquainted with the cantankerous author. Since the police accept that Conway killed himself, some people discourage Susan's investigations. Why rock the boat, after all? The intrepid editor carries on regardless, putting herself in grave peril.In the end, Susan uncovers all. She learns the the truth about Alan Conway and finds the chapters that conclude Magpie Murders. So job well done! Anthony Horowitz's dual suspense novel is well-crafted and a fitting homage to the 'golden age of British mysteries.' For added fun, Magpie Murders contains cunning tributes to people and places in Agatha Christie's mystery books.....and clever allusions and puzzles. Very amusing all around.

Alan was a difficult person to work with but still the more Susan searches for the missing chapters, the more she doubts suicide to be the true nature of Alan's death. Now she is chasing after two murder mysteries.'Magpie Murders' is a book within a book. One part is about the fictitious detective novels of the Atticus Pund series, a hugely successful franchise. While Alan Conway is a pain to work with, the hype and popularity generated by his books makes him invaluable for the publishing house. Susan is shocked to be missing the last chapters and even more so when she learns that Alan is dead. That is the other part of the book. The apparent suicide. There is no denying that Alan rubbed plenty people the wrong way but enough to be murdered? Susan soon realizes that the key to finding out what really happened to Alan is to find the missing chapters. Though there are a lot of parallels, its done in a smart way. This work is a murder combo that is both modern and contemporary that pays homage to Agatha Christie and the golden era of whodunnits. Its a smart and clever work of the classic British detective in a modern day setting.

I thought it was a little too long however, and I was relieved when I finished it. Another problem I had, and I realise it's a niggly little \"nothing\" problem was the way the pages were. The manuscript is one book, and has its own page count, and Susan's story is another book, which also has its own page count. Like I said a niggly little problem, but it annoyed me, I don't know why exactly.Also, I actually did figure everything out quite early on, so that did affect my enjoyment of the book when I realised I was right!But I would still recommend this book, I think. I enjoyed the act of reading it and found it entertaining."}, {"userName": "JanB ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb", "userReview": "4.5 starsThis was a Traveling Sister group read with Brenda, Norma, Lindsay, Jaline, Susanne, Holly, Linda and PorshaJo. We all enjoyed it and it will be on a favorites list for many of us.I'm a huge fan of Agatha Christie and the entire genre. This was a great read, better than a 4 and just missing a 5 star by a hair. It was great fun reading it with the Traveling Sisters group as we discussed the clues and played amateur sleuth trying to figure out whodunit in this clever literary mystery that is a story within a story, with both stories interconnected. Good job Mr Horowitz! If a book is rated purely on enjoyment this is a 5 star read and highly recommended - storytelling at it's best!I was going to add to the above review but I think its best for a reader to go in knowing as little as possible and find out for themselves :-)The (no spoiler) Traveling Sister review on this book and others can be found on their blog at:https://twogirlslostinacouleereading...."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-jean", "userReview": "[\u201cThe world was not exactly going to be a worse-off place without Alan Conway.

After working with the bestselling crime writer for years, she\u2019s intimately familiar with his detective, Atticus P\u00fcnd, who solves mysteries disturbing sleepy English villages. An homage to queens of classic British crime such as Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers, Alan\u2019s traditional formula has proved hugely successful. So successful that Susan must continue to put up with his troubling behavior if she wants to keep her job.Conway\u2019s latest tale has Atticus P\u00fcnd investigating a murder at Pye Hall, a local manor house. Yes, there are dead bodies and a host of intriguing suspects, but the more Susan reads, the more she\u2019s convinced that there is another story hidden in the pages of the manuscript: one of real-life jealousy, greed, ruthless ambition, and murder.", "title": "Magpie Murders", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075854-magpie-murders", "average": 3.95, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1504599398l/32075854.jpg", "reviews": 4400, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32590.Anthony_Horowitz", "name": "Anthony Horowitz"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Audiobook"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075854-magpie-murders", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3785646-magpie-murders", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075639-magpie-murders", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34835346-magpie-murders", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32970179-magpie-murders", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31063914-magpie-murders", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36352783-magpie-murders", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136782.Stormbreaker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/542414.Scorpia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/224500.Point_Blank", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/103983.Skeleton_Key", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175004.Eagle_Strike"]}
