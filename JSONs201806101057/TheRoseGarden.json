The gardens at Trelowarth have for generations grown roses and been tended by generations of Halletts, with Eva's friends Mark and his sister Susan Hallett now in charge of the house and gardens.It is on her first morning there that Eva begins to experience a series of strange events, voices and hallucinations that she puts down to grief and stress at the recent loss of her sister. But when these hallucinations continue and grow ever clearer, Eva realises that what she is experiencing is real, and that somehow she is able to move back and forth through time.In 1715, Daniel Butler is the resident of Trelowarth House with his brother Jack and his friend Fergal. Daniel is a free-trader, although the law calls him a smuggler. But Eva has landed in a dangerous era. The 1715 Jacobite Uprising was not restricted to Scotland. James Stuart had his supporters in Cornwall as well. And Daniel is caught up in the intrigue of the times. As Eva continues to travel between her own time and the past she becomes increasingly attracted to Daniel. But with no say over how or when she travels through time, Eva wonders how this will all end and if she could ever have a future with Daniel. In the past.Like Susanna Kearsley's other novels I've read, this story has a gothic feel, not darkly gothic but hauntingly beautiful. She brings the story alive incorporating details of 18th century life such as food and cooking, running a household, clothing, sailing; and setting her story around real historical figures who were instrumental in the Jacobite Uprising in Cornwall. Susanna Kearsley effortlessly draws all the threads of her story together at the end, weaving the sub-plots into an integrated whole. Characters, remarks, events that seem incidental to the story become important later on. There is something so masterful and yet deceptively simple about Susanna Kearsley's prose. Her writing is like the little black cocktail dress - simple, classic, elegant. When Eva tries to understand what is happening to her, Daniel explains -'When I meet a wind I cannot fight,' he said, 'I can do naught but set my sails to let it take me where it will.'Beautifully crafted, Susanna Kearsley has written another romantic historical fiction as fine as 'Mariana' and 'The Winter Sea'. At the conclusion of 'The Rose Garden' I was left with a sense of deep satisfaction. This is romantic historical fiction at its best.4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Frances", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37439004-frances", "userReview": "A Good YarnThe tale is a good yarn, primarily along the romantic side with touches of historical data incorporated throughout. The author provides a substantial amount of detail about the main characters which makes them all the more realistic. Although I found it a bit slow at the beginning, I soon began to enjoy the colourful characters and found it flowed along nicely. If you have never read a S.

I found this vital element seriously lacking in \"The Rose Garden.\" Daniel and Fergal should have been shocked by a woman from the future suddenly appearing out of thin air; e.g., they should have been questioning her about her strange appearance, what time period she came from, what it was like in the future; etc., etc. Instead, they're pretty much blas\u00e9 about this mysterious phantom woman. Fergal is a little taken aback at first but any misgivings he has are short lived. Before you know it, he's behaving like a mother hen towards this poor girl from the future. It seems the author attempts to explain this scenario by depicting Daniel and Fergus as \"scientific types.\" Well, scientifically-minded or not, most people would be slightly freaked out by something like this happening. This scenario is not even remotely believable.Although I thought the writing was good and I enjoyed reading the descriptions of Cornwall, I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting, and I had to force myself to keep reading.

Kearsley certainly has du Maurier's talent for sense of place and Stewart's mix of romance and suspense, however I'm not so sold on the Gabaldon comparison though both do deal with time-travel. Gabladon's books are dense and history-heavy (something I happen to love) and while this may be historical fiction it's of a much lighter variety. This book is romantic with just enough suspense and explanation behind the time-travel to make it a thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying read. For me, it would have come in at 4 stars (being a bit light in the historical element with a few references that had me raising my eyebrows) except I loved the time-travel twist at the end--that pushed it almost to 5 stars.

So, that means I'll love this book right?Wrong. I didn't LOVE it. I liked it. It was good but not outstanding (the way Outlander was). It was interesting but not interesting enough to warrant the comparison to Outlander.Hold up, don't get me wrong here.This book was good. I thought the beginning was excellent. I thought the ending was satisfying. It was the middle that made the book just good but not great.My experience with Susanna Kearsley consists of The Winter Sea & this book. Both books I absolutely adored at the beginning. Both books I loved the ending. Both books I almost stopped reading in the middle out of pure boredom. Notice a pattern? Yup, the author has a tendency to drag the middle portion of her books to the point of book-stopping-boredom. I've learned in my vast Kearsley reading experience to read through the boredom so that I can be rewarded with a fantastic ending. It would be nice if her books didn't bore me at all in the middle but I can't have everything!Ok. I\u2019ve said a lot without saying one word about the actual story. (it\u2019s a talent of mine)The Story-The story is actually really simple-Girl\u2019s sister dies. Girl goes back \u201chome\u201d to scatter sister\u2019s ashes. Girl time travels. Girl falls for guy back in time. What to do? What to do?That pretty much sums up the plot. What saves the simple plot is the characters.

Then it had that du Maurier flavor, the atmosphere of Jamaica Inn and the mystery element, the historical setting and charming gentleman that put me in mind of Winston Graham\u2019s Poldark, with the addition of a well-conceived and executed time-travel angle. What\u2019s not to like? My only regret is that I let it languish on my bookshelf for over a year.There was something about this remote western corner of Britain that captured the soul and refused to let go, something ancient and wild in the moors and black cliffs and the voice of the sea that spoke always of something unseen and enchanted.I was so in the mood for this sweet romantic tale that swept me along and swept me away from my everyday world of problems and sorrows. Sometimes, somewhere else is just where we want to be, and today 17th Century England was just the right place for me and Daniel Butler was just the right man.I hope Susanna Kearsley has more of this up her sleeve.

If you have read a Susanna Kersley's book before you would know that she writes her stories in dual time. You have the present where the story begins and the past where the actual story takes place and she will find one way or the other to get you there. In Winter Sea she brought us to the past by introducing a character who had the memories of one of her ancestors, in Marianna it was reincarnation and in the Rose Garden there is actual time travel to the past. Now why exactly only the main character and some other character seems to suffer from this particular problem is not sufficiently explained even though the author did mention something about a calling and need that is so great that it transcends time. That combined with the corresponding geographical location VOILA!! you have instant time travel. So there is Eva losing her sister and best friend Katrina to some illness in the present. Who travels to Trelowarths, a place where she and her sister spent time in their childhood, to scatter her ashes. While staying at Trelowarths Eva gets transported to the past to the year 1715 where she meets Danial Butler a smuggler who lived at Trelowarths at that time. Boy meets Girl and the story takes on...Of course this book cannot be classified as straight romance as there is a lot of history thrown in to the mix, which is highly accurate.In all the Susanna Kearsley book I have read the past is always centered around the failed Jacobite revolution of 1715. Even though each and every one of the protogonist does not suffer a sad ending due to the same it nevertheless does not amount to a satisfying read knowing that all the planning and preparation is going for a failed cause( that is if you are a fan of happy endings). In fact I think this book along with the two books mentioned above should be termed as series reads because the background for the story is same, only the characters and places differ. The same formula borders on to predictabilty that one suffers only when one is acquainted with the author's other works. As a stand alone novel The Rose Garden is an interesting read. The author has a gift with words that helps to create vivid images for the reader. The descriptions are endless and detailed about every other irrelevant thing in this book except the description of the main character. Even now after finishing the book I still don't know what the main character Eva looks like. Was she tall? What was the color of her hair? her eyes?. The author leaves this entirely up to the readers discretion but frankly I found it very difficult to read on without having any idea about whom to place in the scenarios. The character development was good although unbelievable at times. The truth is, it is hard to believe that both the characters have fallen head over heels in love only after a few encounters. I don't think there were enough exchanges between them to warrent such an outcome and that too when Daniel Butler was supposedily suffering from the lose of his beloved wife. On the whole The Rose Garden is a fascinating read if you have not much experience with the author's other novels. Even then it does not fall short of a good read. I would recommend this book to people who are in to time travel fiction."}, {"userName": "TL ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl", "userReview": "Red is the rose that in yonder garden growsFair is the lily of the valleyClear is the water that flows from the BoyneBut my love is fairer than any.Come over the hills, my bonnie Irish lassCome over the hills to your darlingYou choose the rose, love, and I'll make the vowAnd I'll be your true love forever.'Twas down by Killarney's green woods that we strayedWhen the moon and the stars they were shiningThe moon shone its rays on her locks of golden hairAnd she swore she'd be my love forever.ChorusIt's not for the parting that my sister painsIt's not for the grief of my mother'Tis all for the loss of my bonny Irish lassThat my heart is breaking forever.Chorus Thought most of this fit the spirit of the book nicely.

The time-travel is accomplished with ley lines. I have encountered this same theory in other novels, so I didn't find it hard to believe it possible in this story.

It has the same sense of place, the beautiful descriptions of landscape, and the same sort of heroine: female, curious, about to be swept up in bigger events than she\u2019d ever have expected. And better: this is explicitly fantastical, where most of Mary Stewart\u2019s books were more mysteries, sometimes with hints at fantasy.And better again, whew, we don\u2019t have first cousins getting married at the end.It does start off with kind of a slow pace, and Eva is only rarely involved in actual action, despite the backdrop of free trading and other such types of derring-do. And it is indeed a romance, so the ending is a happy one for most of the characters (though there\u2019s a sadder note, too, with Eva\u2019s sister\u2019s husband; I was glad there was some closure at the end of story with him as well, even if it was a sadder story), and there\u2019s plenty of romance going on \u2014 not just for Eva, but in the background. And yeah, I think Fergal and Daniel take the time travelling woman a little too lightly. They\u2019re curious, but not curious enough to feel realistic. They both just decide to protect her right away.But I enjoyed it anyway: it has a great atmosphere, and the writing flows well. It\u2019s a bit like The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife, I guess, in that I wouldn\u2019t want to examine how the timeline works too closely lest it fall apart, but it was the ideal fluff, and it had enough substance that I cared about the characters."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3413113-erin", "userReview": "I would really have loved to give this 3.5 stars.www.theultimatebooknook.blogspot.comAfter reading The Winter Sea, I knew I had to read more by that author, so I picked this book up.I wanted to love it as much as I did The Winter Sea but sadly I didn't. It was still enjoyable and very well written, it just didn't have the enchantment that The Winter Sea did.Kearsley is a fantastic writer. She brings you into these worlds and makes you feel them. She can bring out so many emotions in just one book. You are sad, then happy and in love. You laugh and cry and feel every moment of the story. Very few authors can do that.Once again, Kearsley found a way to weave past and present together in an incredible way. It amazes me, the inventiveness she uses to put these stories together. Just like with the other book, I was much more into the past's story line than the present's. It is probably the hopeless romantic in me, since this is where the love story happens. The Rose Garden sagged a little in the middle. I found myself skimming parts trying to find where the story was going to pick up again. But, the plot twist at the end made up for that. I just felt the ending was too rushed. I wanted to know more. I wanted the loose ends to be tied up a bit better. I can't say much without giving parts of the story away but if you read it, I'm sure you will understand.In the end it was a good book, just a bit disappointing.

I now understand them to be a group that desired to restore the Roman Catholic Stuart King James II of England and Ireland . The sitting King, George, was not too pleased with that (!) and he and his followers considered them traitors worthy of death.The story alternates between present day in which plans to open a tearoom and garden tour are underway and the past, where Eva falls for Daniel.Lots of tie-ins between past and present.

It all just fit so seamlessly into the story. You know when some detail of a book so obviously sets up some plot point later in the book? This was the opposite!I could have wished for the ending to be a bit more flushed out (I love a good reunion scene), but other than that, this was well written, intriguing, character-driven, and unpredictable. Since this was my first Kearsley I didn't know whether a happy ending was inevitable, so I was more anxious than usual during the last 20%, but that just made it more suspenseful and exciting. Time travels are usually hit or miss for me, but this was a different take on it since Eva traveled back and forth throughout the book rather than being stuck in one time period. I would say the majority of the book took place in the present and I loved the scenes from the past, so I could have spent hours longer on that, but small quibble.

I know others have criticized the book, saying that it's not believable. To this I say, reading any fiction book or watching any movie that isn't a documentary requires suspension of belief. If you can't suspend your belief then you should stick to reading & watching non-fiction. On that note, let me get on with this review. Several things I liked about this book. Eva is a normal woman who finds herself in extraordinary circumstances. Somehow she finds herself traveling to the past when she's at Trelowarth. She meets several people while in the past but it's Daniel Butler who catches her eye. The beginning of the book practically made me cry. The way Kearsley wrote about the loss of Katrina (Eva's sister) was very touching. The descriptions of the landscape of Cornwall were also lovely. Daniel's character isn't drawn in too much detail. But what we do know about him is that he's a steady, intelligent man. I actually liked that Eva's physical looks weren't minutely described. For me the book was more about Eva's inner journey. So the way she looked wasn't so important. Fergal was a hoot. And Creed was a creep. There are some poignant ideas about death, love & time in this book that I thought were sufficiently deep to keep my interest. The pacing between the different times was a little uneven though. When Eva first travels back in time it's as if things got interesting right away. But in her own time things were a bit more hum drum. Which is probably another reason why Eva began to associate more with the past than her present time. In any case, I do think this book was well written. I will definitely take a look at Kearsley's other books in the future to see if I like them as much."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5130686-jennifer", "userReview": "[It drove me a little crazy that she didn't explore the places where she detected changes in the landscape often, ie, the woods, etc., to actively try to get back to the past, especially when she felt she urgently needed to!

And, I continue to devour them happily and greedily.So I was thrilled to discover her newest release, \u2018The Rose Garden\u2019 this month! Her books almost defy categorization because they are haunting time travels woven between historical and contemporary time periods placing them as paranormals. But whatever their \u2018category\u2019 the feelings they evoke and read they provide place them at the top of any list as far as I\u2019m concerned.Like \u2018The Winter Sea\u2019, Kearsley laces the right touch of paranormal with possibility to heighten the sensuous characters so perfectly drawn that their depth and personality allow them to practically leap off the page and take you with them on the journey as centuries melt into one another and the reader becomes deliciously immersed in the tale no matter what the time period and, with minimal effort at doing it.Kearlsey\u2019s \u2018The Rose Garden\u2019 delivers on all accounts with a haunting, atmospheric and romantic story in Eva Ward whose return to the home, Trelowarth, she loved during childhood summers on the Cornish coast brings to life the past and lights her future path. Following the death of her sister Katrina, Eva decides to scatter her ashes in the one place they both felt they truly belonged. Staying with friends Mark and Susan and their step-mother Claire, who have decided to open a Tea Room, she spends the summer helping her friends launch their new venture. And, discovering the voices and hidden pathways of the home and grounds that lead her back three centuries to Jack and Daniel Butler \u2013 original owners of Trelowarth. Somehow, Eva has become an unwitting time traveler whose vistas melts and shifts to reveal a new setting.Well-known and respected smugglers and Jacobites, the Butler brothers operate \u2018The Sally\u2019 a ship conducting trade and are hunted by the evil Constable Creed whose sister, Anna was Daniel\u2019s late wife. Attended by loyal, family friend Fergal, Eva learns the ways of 1714 and wins the heart of Daniel whom she comes to love. But her involuntary shifts between the centuries mean she must discover the meaning behind them, how to help the Butlers and decide where she truly belongs. Thanks to the staunch Claire whose own secret helps Eva unlock the mystery, finding happiness in the right century may be possible.The poetic descriptions and settings coupled with the lyrical prose are so captivating as to weave a web around readers from which there is no desire to escape. Conflict and tension go hand-in-hand between the centuries, their characters and sub-plots delivering a page-turning read in which we keep wondering how this is going to work. All of which is heightened when Daniel pronounces to Eva, \u201cWhatever time we have,\u201d he said, \u201cit will be time enough.\u201d We can feel Eva\u2019s confusion, love, despair and excitement over leaving and returning to Daniel, her time period adjustments and aching for resolution. Clever plot twists and details are elegantly peppered into the story (look for the dagger and watch the plumber) and provide a richly satisfying and provocative story you\u2019ll hate to put down.Curling up with one of Susan\u2019s books is like being under a warm blanket with a cuppa tea before a roaring fire ready to have her tale whisk you away as she does Eva. Run to the bookstore, your Kindle or Nook and purchase this luxurious read that gets A+ in delivering everything you could ever want in a read!"}, {"userName": "LJ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250195-lj", "userReview": "First Sentence: I lost my only sister in the last days of November.After the death of her sister, Eva travels from Los Angeles to Cornwall, where they spent summers as children, to scatter her sister\u2019s ashes and find a bit of peace among old friends. She doesn\u2019t expect to, without any warning, find herself transported back to the 18th century, become involved with Jacobite supporters, smugglers and a man to whom she is very attracted. But traveling back-and-forth through time isn\u2019t easy\u2014how does one explain jeans\u2014and deciding where truly belongs is hardest of all.Ms. Kearsley\u2019s very compelling voice and opening draw one into the story from the first sentence. She knows how to touch your emotions while offsetting that with wonderful situational, dry humor. Ms. Kearsley is very good at giving you the sense of the paranormal with the normal. She shifts time in a way I\u2019ve not previously encountered, which was both interesting and intriguing. However, the problem with writing time travel is developing a explanation for why it happens, and that was never convincingly done, as opposed to in her prior book \u201cThe Winter Sea. There is a very good sense of place and time and both periods of the story. Considering the limited locale in which she was working, this was significant to the enjoyment of the story. You are given a full sense of being there.The plot was intriguing and well done with a fascinating and seamless incorporation of history into the story. .\u201d Ms. Kearsley provided an interesting perspective on being in the past and knowing about those who had no idea they would be known through history. The book begins with shades of it being a gothic, but then moves into romance and was, at times, a bit trite, but with a very good plot twist at the end.\u201cThe Rose Garden\u201d is an enjoyable read but a bit disappointing as one has come to expect a bit more depth from Ms. Kearsley.

Don't know why, but that book rather ruined the whole phenomena for me. Thankfully, this book has rekindled my fire! The Rose Garden is part romance, part time travel mystery, part historical adventures and part pure whimsical magic. And somehow Kearsley managed to wrap them all together into a really well written piece of art! Eva's sister has just died, and in order to 'bring her where she belongs' she returns to their childhood summer spot of the Cornish wilds of England. But while dealing with her grief there, she manages to slip between the veils of time about 300 years into the past. While drifting in between with no logic that she can grasp, Eva ends up falling in love with a smuggler who is living in the house back in the early 1700's. She's torn between staying with him and staying in her time, but realizes that there is ultimately nothing keeping her in the present. Or is there? She has very good friends and perhaps a love interest there as well. Not to mention a really great future in her career. And yet is love worth leaving your own time for?The things that got me the most in the book were the heart-wrenching details of love (hopeless romantic here) and the nifty sci-fi time travel bits. At first I wanted to figure out the logic of it all as well, and was planning on writing a pretty scathing review tearing the logic to shreds, but by the end of the story it all made perfect sense. Now, as a California girl, I'd love to go visit this rough and tumble coast and see it's magic firsthand.

Her writing style is simply beautiful and has a definite talent for writing fascinating stories. I\u2019m not usually a fan of wordy books but she does such an amazing job of describing the simplest of things you can\u2019t help but love it.One of my favorites:\u201cAnd at the window of the room the cold November rains slid down the glass and cast their shifting shadows in a room that could no longer hold the light.\u201dRose Garden tells the story of Eva and her struggles to cope with the death of her sister Katrina. Katrina had requested to be cremated and have her ashes scattered; Eva decides it would be most fitting for her to scatter them where the two of them once belonged: Cornwall, England. She travels there and stays with her two childhood friends Mark and Susan. During her first night there, she wakes to the sound of two men having a conversation only to find there weren\u2019t any men in the house. She then begins to see things that others cannot and is unable to explain it. When she finds herself thrown back in time, she meets Daniel Butler, a man who was a part of the Jacobite Uprising. Knowing what she does about the outcome of said event, she finds it difficult to not disclose information to him that could essentially change the future. The more time spent with Daniel, the closer she becomes to him, as she finds herself bonding with him as two people who have both lost loved ones. Eva\u2019s only concern is for her inability to control when she goes back in time and how the two of them can ever have a life together based on this instability. Lovely novel. I\u2019ll definitely be picking up more of her books in the future."}], "description": "When Eva's film star sister Katrina dies, she leaves California and returns to Cornwall, where they spent their childhood summers, to scatter Katrina's ashes and in doing so return her to the place where she belongs. But Eva must also confront the ghosts from her own past, as well as those from a time long before her own. For the house where she so often stayed as a child is home not only to her old friends the Halletts, but also to the people who had lived there in the eighteenth century. When Eva finally accepts that she is able to slip between centuries and see and talk to the inhabitants from hundreds of years ago, she soon finds herself falling for Daniel Butler, a man who lived - and died - long before she herself was born. Eva begins to question her place in the present, and in laying her sister to rest, comes to realise that she too must decide where she really belongs, choosing between the life she knows and the past she feels so drawn towards.", "title": "The Rose Garden", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9792287-the-rose-garden", "average": 4.02, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327951839l/9792287.jpg", "reviews": 2717, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/486812.Susanna_Kearsley", "name": "Susanna Kearsley"}], "type": ["Historical", "Romance", "Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9792287-the-rose-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10836066-the-rose-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12273538-the-rose-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12806059-the-rose-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25020346-the-rose-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3392089-the-winter-sea", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/961833.Mariana", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15942636-the-firebird", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/961831.The_Shadowy_Horses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22221136-a-desperate-fortune", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26813208-thirty-five-and-a-half-conspiracies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489452-thirty-one-and-a-half-regrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20687181-thirty-two-and-a-half-complications", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198652-twenty-eight-and-a-half-wishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15836745-twenty-nine-and-a-half-reasons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29339972-thirty-six-and-a-half-motives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23263614-thirty-three-and-a-half-shenanigans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40199170-thirty-and-a-half-excuses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments"]}
