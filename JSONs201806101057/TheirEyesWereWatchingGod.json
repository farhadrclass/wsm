On the other hand it was slow moving, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I felt things could've been cut to keep the story moving better.

The love story of Janie and Tea Cake is one of stupendous beauty. Zora Neal Hurston's text is a treasure:\"So she went on thinking in soft, easy phrases while all around the house, the night time put on flesh and blackness.\"Early in life, Janie is taken care of by her grandmother Nanny,\"Every tear you drop squeezes a cup uh blood outa mah heart\"As she grew, \"Janie waited for a bloom time, a green time and an orange time.\"She is married off to an old, rich man, but grows restless, \"There are years that ask questions and years that answer.\"Ultimately , she gets an answer takes off with the ambitious Jody Starks. But, her hopes are shattered as Jody's ambitions in Eatonville, FL (coincidentally Hurston's hometown) where she feels,\"Four walls squeezing her breath out.\" as Jody ignores her and builds his empire in the town. He passes away and Janie meets her true love Tea Cake and she seems to have found her inner peace:\"So she sat on the porch and watched the moon rise. Soon its amber fluid was drenching the earth, and quenching the thirst of the day.\"Tea Cake gives her some lessons of wisdom:\"See dat? You'se got de world in uh jug and make out you don't know it. But Ah'm glad tuh be the one tuh tell yuh.\"She sheds her reticences and fears in her love for him:\"He drifted off to sleep and Janie looked down on him and felt a soul-crushing love. So her soul crawled out from its hiding place.\"She never takes on any religion for:\"All gods who receive homage are cruel. All gods dispense suffering without reason. Otherwise, they would not be worshipped.\"Her love is her temple as she dreamed of under the pear trees as a young girl with Nanny. Disaster eventually strikes, as it always does, gods dispensing their unreasoning suffering.\"The wind came back with triple fury, and put out the light for the last time. They sat in company with the others in other shanties, their eyes straining against crude walls and their souls asking if He meant to measure their puny might against His. They seemed to be staring at the dark, but their eyes were watching God.\"This novel was a forgotten masterpiece published in 1935 but forgotten until Alice Walker rediscovered her - and her gravesite - in 1977. Since, it has been appreciated as the quiet, beautiful monument to a woman's strength and endurance. A must read in these times of women-hating rhetoric in Drumpf's amerikkka. The attacks on Planned Parenthood and the bullshit \"reverse discrimination\" are just two of the many demonstrations of why this book is important as both a feminist and anti-racist classic.Their Eyes Were Watching God is one of the most beautifully evoked portraits of a woman of color that I have ever read."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201dDey gointuh make \u2018miration \u2018cause mah love didn\u2019t work lak they love, if dey ever had any. Then you must tell \u2018em dat love ain\u2019t somethin\u2019 lak uh grindstone dat\u2019s de same thing everywhere and do de same thing tuh everything it touch. Love is lak de sea. It\u2019s uh movin\u2019 thing, but still and all, it takes its shape from de shore it meets, and it\u2019s different with every shore.\u201dJanie Crawford knows about love. She knows how life is with it and she knows how life is without it. She had three marriages with varying degrees of success. The first was a marriage with a much older man when she was on the verge of womanhood. Her Grandmother, fearing her own death, and wanting to make sure that Janie had some security in her life made arrangements with a man of means to be her husband. Nanny wasn\u2019t worried about love, but about whether a man could provide. She was looking at her granddaughter\u2019s future with old eyes. Love and lust, from her withered view, were just enticements best skipped for the security of a solid roof and a steady diet of square meals. Nanny was a force of nature and any protest that Janie may have thought about making was quickly swallowed up in the gale force wind of her grandmother\u2019s will.\u201dNanny\u2019s head and face looked like the standing roots of some old tree that had been torn away by storm. Foundation of ancient power that no longer mattered. The cooling palma christi leaves that Janie had bound about her grandma\u2019s head with a white rag had wilted down and become part and parcel of the woman. Her eyes didn\u2019t bore and pierce. They diffused and melted Janie, the room and the world into one comprehension.\u201d\nZora Neale HurstonIt wasn\u2019t long before a smooth talking man by the name of Joe Starks came along and told her all the wonderful things he would be doing with his life. With barely a twist of her arm she jumped in the buggy with him and moved to Eatonville, Florida where an all black community was being formed into a town. Joe could see the potential and opened up a general store/post office and started making money hand over fist. He didn\u2019t like the way the men looked at Janie and had her tie up her lovely hair everyday so as not to rile up so much lust in the male population. He was controlling and had words of \u201cwisdom\u201d to attach to everything he instructed her to do.\u201dYou sho loves to tell me whut to do, but Ah can\u2019t tell you nothin\u2019 Ah see!\u201d\u201cDat\u2019s \u2018cause you need tellin\u2019\u2019 Joe rejoined hotly. \u201cIt would be pitiful if Ah didn\u2019t. Somebody got to think for women and chillun and chickens and cows. I god, they sho don\u2019t think none theirselves.\u201dNow Joe just seemed to fold all up in himself and took sickly and died leaving Janie with a good stack of green and as good a living as she wanted to make. Now Janie was North of forty, but was still a damn good looking woman. \"The men noticed her firm buttocks like she had grape fruits in her hip pockets; the great rope of black hair swinging to her waist and unraveling in the wind like a plume; then her pugnacious breasts trying to bore holes in her shirt. They, the men, were saving with the mind what they lost with the eye.\u201d\nThe Lovely Halle Barry played Janie Crawford in the 2005 movie versionThe men of the community that had been having unnatural thoughts that came...well...very naturally to them regarding this married woman soon found themselves on the outside track once she became a widow. A young man by the name of Tea Cake showed up and suddenly for the first time Janie found out what love felt like. Dear lord did the community carry on about this old woman shaking the sheets with this youngster with no money and no name for himself. Janie herself was suspicious even pushed him about the thought that his intentions might be built on false pretenses. \u201dJanie, Ah hope God may kill me, if Ah\u2019m lyin\u2019. Nobody else on earth kin hold uh candle tuh you, baby. You got de keys to de kingdom.\u201dNow what woman could resist that. \nI'm ready. Where do you want to go?They moved down in the Everglades to pick beans by day and for Tea Cake to shake the dice by night. He could pick a mean guitar as well and sang songs for the entertainment of all those hard working people.\nYo\u2019 mama don\u2019t wear no DrawsAh seen her when she took \u2018em OffShe soaked \u2018em in alcoHolShe sold \u2018em tuh de Santy ClausHe told her \u2018twas aginst de LawTo wear dem dirty Draws\nLike all her other husbands Tea Cake is not above being jealous. Men kept circling around her like bees looking for a hive. \u201dBefore the week was over he had whipped Janie. Not because her behavior justified his jealousy, but it relieved that awful fear inside him. Being able to whip her reassured him in possession. No brutal beating at all. He just slapped her around a bit to show who was boss. Everybody talked about it next day in the fields. It aroused a sort of envy in both men and women. The way he petted and pampered her as if those two or three face slaps had nearly killed her made the women see visions and the helpless way she hung on him made men dream dreams.\u201d\nYeah they are looking at you Zora.Now there are hurricanes, heart breaks, rabid dogs, lustful men, stiletto knives, and a young girl blossoming into a beautiful woman that has to find her place in the geometry and geography of love. Hurston has a keen eye for observation and an attentive ear for conversation. I had so many notes and jotted down so many page numbers of amazing quotes that if I\u2019d worked them all into this review I\u2019d go way over my allotted word count. Now Zora Neale Hurston did not become famous for being a gifted writer. She worked as a substitute school teacher, librarian, freelance writer, and even as a maid towards the end of her life. When she suffers a stroke in 1959 she is forced to enter the St. Lucie County Welfare Home where she remains until her death on January 28th, 1960 from hypertensive heart disease. She is buried in an unmarked grave in the Garden of Heavenly Rest, Fort Pierce. In the 1970s Alice Walker becomes an advocated for Hurston\u2019s body of work. Through Walker\u2019s efforts Zora\u2019s reputation is restored and her works begin to be added to the syllabuses of major universities. As a final tribute to Hurston, Walker finds the approximate point of her internment and puts a grave marker on the site. This is vindication for a voice that was not heard by enough people when she was alive, but now at last she is being read, discussed, and loved.

The modernism of \"Their Eyes\" lies in the intermixing of 1930's black vernacular with poetic lines which themselves carry astute and precise craft--this is outstanding. Lightning in a bottle--that's what this book reads like.I love to choose sides in literary battles--most of which are absurd but still funny to reminisce about (as if the reader himself was actually there). Richard Wright versus Hurston. A 500 page discourse on the unfairness of being black (\"Native Son\"), vs. this, a behemoth underdog, a \"rediscovered\" gem of a novel which sings and never underwhelms. \"Their Eyes\" is better, Hurston a better writer, THE END. Janie the pre-feminist heroine is incredibly free--restraints are identified & gotten rid of properly--& this independence can be seen in the intrepid style with which high & low literature interplay. The prose is severely, sincerely alive.The sadness comes when you realize that Hurston was outright forgotten--she had to be found, her grave properly marked, by none other than Alice Walker (the topic for a screenplay perhaps?). Even the man at the end of \"Their Eyes\" has a proper burial, while she, the progenitor of it all was utterly forgotten--but re-found by smart and freeminded readers. The prophecy is chilling, but the body of work is its stark opposite--alive, beautiful, raw, human, poetic, godly."}, {"userName": "Samadrita", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita", "userReview": "Here is a woman who led a wretched life for years, doomed to stagnate in the drab depths of oblivion even after her death which had gone under the radar and generated no nostalgia-soaked, emotional obituaries. She lay in an unmarked grave in the Garden of Heavenly Rest, Florida, treated by her own contemporaries like an outcast because of a difference in perspectives, to be resuscitated and acknowledged as one of the foremost powerful voices that ever reverberated across the African-American literary landscape years later. And here is her creation, a 'coffee-and-cream' skinned Janie Crawford, a child born out of a possible rape, a sure forerunner to Toni Morrison's Sethe, Denver and Beloved or Alice Walker's Celie and Nettie. A mulatto woman in a white man's world, who grew aware of an identity not shackled by notions of race, skin color, and even gender, who could look beyond the small horizon carelessly conferred on her by an era which was bluntly apathetic to her kind, who could aspire to be free of a legacy of mere victimhood.And here I am, trying to make sure I do not fuse Zora and Janie together, unable to decide how to love, revere and pity them at the same time.I watched the young and carefree Janie, who bubbled over with an enthusiasm for life, eventually morph into the Janie who embraced the bittersweet realization of having loved and lost. My eyes traced her unsure footsteps from financial servitude to financial stability, from the daily battle of ignoring the sting of self-denial to grasping at a life free of emotional subservience. I loved the hapless, innocent Janie who consented to being passed over like property from her grandmother's ownership to her first husband's just as much I admired the Janie who found her salvation in Tea Cake's good-natured laughter after two marriages which had simultaneously stripped her of her last shred of self-esteem and caused her to listen to that stifled inner voice. And I felt a strange kind of happiness building up inside for the Janie who would not succumb to the temptation of self-loathing like the misguided Mrs Turner, the Janie who found the firm ground of self-awareness to tread on while the world of conflicting ideas rotated on its axis like ever.Zora Neale Hurston had a rich dual voice - one of them fearlessly recounting the quirks characterizing the Black American community in the deep south still clinging on to the outer fringes of a white-dominated society intertwined with the lyrical, oneiric voice of a philosopher and a feminist, possibly one of the first among her kind. And it is this wholly harmonious union of these two voices which transforms this bildungsroman into a honeyed ballad of love and grief, of psychological bondage and emancipation.\n\"He looked like the love thoughts of women. He could be a bee to a blossom-a pear tree blossom in the spring. He seemed to be crushing scent out of the world with his footsteps. Crushing aromatic herbs with every step he took. Spices hung about him. He was a glance from God.\"\nJanie never bore a grudge against her 'God' for making her path to fulfillment so long and arduous. She merely watched Him with hopeful eyes, lovingly accepting all He bestowed on her. And I watched Janie with a tear-strained smile."}, {"userName": "AJ Griffin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166906-aj-griffin", "userReview": "Another \"I don't remember it very well, but I know I liked it\" story.

It's a moving thing, but still and all, it takes its shape from the shore it meets, and it's different with every shore.\" In the beginning, there was Nanny. Nanny knew what it meant to be a slave to men. And Nanny had a daughter. She saw what happened to her, how she chose to escape pain in oblivion. And Nanny was scared. She was so scared that she wanted to prevent the same thing from happening to her daughter's daughter, even if it meant that she had to force her grandchild to be unhappy. As long as she was unhappy in a different, secure way, with an old and stable man by her side.That is the background of Janie Crawford's story. She is in her early forties, and starts telling a friend her life story in beautiful, colloquial language. And what a life it is! So common and typical, and yet individually painful and loving.Three men, three facets of female experience. Three ways to love and respect each other, and to abuse and kill each other's spirit. Sometimes our family's fear of suffering makes us suffer more than anything we could possibly live through ourselves. And sometimes we find love where we least expect it. Janie sings the Ballad of the Gaol of Woman:\"Some love too little, some too long,Some sell, and others buy;Some do the deed with many tears,And some without a sigh:For each (wo)man kills the thing (s)he loves,Yet each (wo)man does not die.\"Recommended to humanity!"}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36555254-robin", "userReview": "I was prepared, based on the many five star reviews for this novel by many of my esteemed Goodreads friends, for a worthy book. I was prepared, based on its 1937 publishing date and its setting of Eatonville, Florida and then the Everglades, that important racial themes would be present. What I wasn't prepared for, however, was to be knocked over completely by the shimmering, feathery-fine, poetic prose. I wasn't prepared to be told a courageous, all-in, love story.Zora Neale Hurston's incredible book is the story of Janie Crawford, a middle aged black woman who has had three marriages. Her grandmother (Nanny) was a slave who had been abused by her white master. Her mother (Leafy) was also a victim of rape. She started drinking and disappeared, leaving Nanny to raise Janie. After seeing Janie kiss a boy as a teenager, Nanny insists on Janie marrying a man she didn't know or love, thinking that this was how she could be safe and happy. The familiar people and things had failed her so she hung over the gate and looked up the road towards way off. She knew now that marriage did not make love. Janie's first dream was dead, so she became a woman.She runs off and marries another man, Joe, who turns out to be a controlling misogynist. Despite providing materially for her, Janie is isolated and unhappy.So gradually, she pressed her teeth together and learned to hush. The spirit of the marriage left the bedroom and took to living in the parlour. It was there to shake hands whenever company came to visit, but it never went back inside the bedroom again.And then, she meets Tea Cake. He's twelve years younger, but he is her match. And she lives with him, wholly and sensuously, the way she imagined the way it would be as a teenager, looking upon a pear tree:She saw a dust-bearing bee sink into the sanctum of a bloom; the thousand sister-calyxes arch to meet the love embrace and the ecstatic shiver of the tree from root to tiniest branch creaming in every blossom and frothing with delight.Oh MY. Are you dying yet? With this writing? No? Then, read on these few short samples:The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky.The morning road air was like a new dress.The stillness was the sleep of swords.No hour is ever eternity, but it has its right to weep.So while I was dizzy with delight, swooning over this writing, I was alternately impressed with the dialogue, written in the dialect of Southern black people of the time. Hurston shows herself to be a master of both poetic prose and colloquial language, and weaves them seamlessly back and forth.While she highlights the ever present racial problems between blacks and whites, she also shows the problems and hindrances caused within her own community, which in some ways are just as limiting. Within the black community there exists a class system, and people are expected to keep to their place. She zeroes in specifically on a woman's place within this culture, and then, in relation to her man.Through all this, shines the love story of Janie and Tea Cake. It is a love that is unhesitating, accepting, passionate and pure. It pulses with adventure and life, and the beating of two devoted hearts.Love is lak the sea. It's uh movin' thing, but still and all, it takes its shape from de shore it meets, and it's different with every shore.I have every admiration for Zora Neale Hurston, who is not only a truly dazzling writer, but an inspiring woman. I learned after reading this book that she was the daughter of former slaves, and that she grew up in the town of Eatonville, where her father was elected mayor. She was a graduate student at Columbia University. Though her life ended in poverty and in an unmarked grave, she left behind a powerful and lasting legacy."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "When I was in school we were given a choice to read Soul on Ice, Johnny got his gun or this book. I choose Johnny, a book that haunts me to this day. Hurston's book always remained in the back of my mind, though I can't help but wonder if I would have appreciated it back then as much as I did now.I did find the dialect difficult at times, but I found if I read it out loud it made more sense. Of course my husband thought I was demented, but he often does. I cannot imagine being married as young as Janie was made to marry vent though I understood her grandmothers reasoning. What a life she had. What a tragic ending. A very important symbol of place and time, was what this novel represents for me.

I noticed this year that my introduction made my students expect the protagonist, Janie, to jump from the novel's pages as a woman warrior, take no shit from anyone, and--I don't know--burn her bra. But the real beauty of Hurston's novel is that her heroine is a real character living in a real world--albeit, one that is touched by literary genius and reflective of literary genres as varied and vital as (Hurston's scholarly focus) African American Folk Tradition and the odyssey of the \"high mimetic form\". (A Black woman presented as the hero of an epic journey in 1937--simply amazing.) Janie struggles. Janie submits. Janie silences herself. But Janie grows. And, in my mind, a revolution begins.Hurston's character construction is superb. At once, her characters are strongly allegorical AND so real that they are breathing entities in the reader's mind (and disturbingly remind you of that uncle you don't really like). Janie is as real as they come. By the end of the story, I, as a reader, am her best friend Pheoby, sitting on that porch with her and listening her to tale. I understand her insecurities, I feel her pain, I smile as she inexplicably giggles for two pages, and I am full of that emotion the conclusion of Hurston's epic tale creates.I love that Hurston gives her readers the tools to understanding Janie's motivation and responses very early in the book in the form of her beautifully constructed pear tree and mule metaphors. It is a wonderful book to teach to those teenagers who still think literary analysis is a sham that teachers come up with to torture students, because Hurston stitches her novel together with meaningful patterns of metaphors and symbols that deliberately guide readers through Janie's experience.Hurston's literary talent shines in her ability both to construct believable, life-like dialogue in strong southern dialect and to create poetic prose rich in metaphor and meaning, as well as in her ability both to spin a tale that leaves the reader in greedy suspense and to write a story that says so much about the nature of love, power, language, race, gender, and identity. The more I read this book, the more I like it.On a side note: As the book is so strongly embedded in oral tradition, my classes listen to a few chapters of the audio book, which is read by Ruby Dee (who also played the role of Janie's grandmother in Oprah's movie).

Hurston's novel, unlike many classics, is as impressive and as relevant today as it was when written.Hurston's story of Janie, a fair-skinned black woman caught in the time period between the end of slavery and the civil rights movement, is the first woman in her family who has the opportunity to be defined as something other than property. Despite this, Janie is unable achieve self-actualization or seek out the independence for which she longs; however, this is not due to the racism or prejudices of white society (in fact, there isn't a prominent white character in the book). Instead, Hurston takes a fascinating look at intraracial racism. Janie's obvious \"whiteness\" sets her apart from the black community. At first, she's envied for her pretty hand-me-down dresses and hair ribbons that she obtains from the kind white family for which her grandmother works. Coupled with her straight hair (which hangs down to her waist), her exquisite beauty, and her light skin, she defies color categorization and leaves the question of \"What is black?\" lacking a definite answer. Later, she's an outcast because her second husband's \"big voice\" and quest for power in the all black community of Eatonville comes to be identified with the white masters of days gone by, and Janie comes to be seen in the role of the Southern plantation \"mistress.\" In addition, Hurston explores the repression of women in a patriarchal society. Janie's grandmother tells her that the black woman is the \"mule of the world,\" the lowest of the low. Janie finds this to be true in her first two marriages, as she is treated like property by Logan Killicks and is later objectified by Jody Starks. It isn't until she meets Tea Cake, a man half her age, that Janie begins to live life on her own terms and not by the definition her man has set forth for her. Whether you like the novel or not, it's importance to African-American and feminist literature is undeniable.Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder"}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "\u201cTo meet as far this morning \u2028From the world as agreeing \u2028With it, you and I \u2028Are suddenly what the trees tryTo tell us we are: \u2028That their merely being there \u2028Means something; that soon \u2028We may touch, love, explain.\u201d  \nSome Trees\n by John Ashberry.Janie returns to Eatonville with the sunbeams glowing on her shoulders giving her the appearance of a luminescent and almost unearthly goddess whose bare feet voluptuously caress the dusty road. Women on porches sing a harmonious chorus of gossip and covetousness while men stare greedily at Janie\u2019s lustrous and long hair and sweeping hips moving to the rhythm of a life washed by the sea tides of love and scented by the pear blossoms of desire.Pheoby, Janie\u2019s best friend and confidante, loses no time to meet the newcomer and inquires after the reasons of her unexpected homecoming. It\u2019s under the shadows of dusk, when languid leaves and elongated branches dance at the tune of ephemeral loves and perennial memories, that Janie discloses her journey in flashbacks and unconsciously intertwines her ultimate search for fulfillment as a woman with the three marriages in her life.From Nanny\u2019s sour aftertaste of slavery that comes with the sustained abuse in the hands of the white master, the debasement inflicted by the mistress and the burden of attaining freedom and not knowing what to do with it, to the subtle division between those with fairer skins and those with darker ones, Zora Neale Hurston elevates Janie\u2019s story to an icon portraying the richness of the Afro-American oral culture and its folkloric dialect, symbolizing the survival of the African spirit after decades of merciless oppression and gratuitous atrocity.  \u201cYou know, honey, us colored folks is branches without roots and that makes things come round in queer ways. You in particular. Ah was born back due in slavery so it wasn\u2019t for me to fulfill my dreams of whut a woman oughta be and to do.\u201d (p. 31) The magic of Hurston\u2019s writing style relays not only in the use of the Afro-American dialect but also in the contrasting classical lyricism of some passages that bond life, love and sensuality together with natural imagery like trees, celestial bodies, seas and shores, which brings enchanting reminiscences of the melodic British Romantic Poets, creating a counter effect for the drumming rawness of the allegorical vernacular. \u201cJanie saw her life like a great tree in leaf with the things suffered, things enjoyed, things done and undone. Dawn and doom was in the branches.\"(p.20)The natural world offers silent wisdom to sixteen years old Janie when laying down languorously in the shade provided by the branches of the pear tree, where the bees hum and disappear in the hidden crevices of its blossoms, she understands the mystery of sexuality. \u201cShe was stretched on her back beneath the pear tree soaking in the alto chant of the visiting bees, the gold of the sun and the painting breath of the breeze when the inaudible voice of it all came to her. She saw a dust-bearing bee sink into the sanctum of a bloom; the thousand sister-calyxes arch to meet the love embrace and the ecstatic shiver of the tree from root to tiniest branch creaming in every blossom and frothing with delight. So this was marriage!\u201d (p. 24)  But the trodden path of life will show Janie that marriage doesn\u2019t compel love like the sun the day. Forced to marry Mr. Killicks, an older farmer who is supposed to offer her the security Nanny so much covets for, passionate Janie discovers that some bees stifle the female spirit, which is screaming out loud to be acknowledged to apparently deaf ears. Defying convention and showing uncommon valor, Janie rebels against stupor and elopes with Joe Starks, an ambitious man who has plans to become a \u201cbig voice\u201d in Eatonville. Unaware at first of Joe\u2019s chauvinism, Janie believes to have found a worthy companion and marries him only to discover throughout the years that her second husband has tyrannical opinions about the role of women in society. Relegated to a mere personal possession, Janie witnesses her own voice drown into the vast ocean of isolation and degradation.Both Killicks and Starks profane that pear tree ignoring the over-ripe fruit that has been waiting to be cherished as it deserved and it is not until many years later, when Janie becomes a forty years old and attractive widow, that Tea Cake appears disguised as the bee that blossoming Janie has been waiting for during all her life, making her soul crawl out from its hiding place. \u201cHe could be a bee to a blossom \u2013 a pear tree blossom in the spring. He seemed to be crushing scent out of the world with his footsteps. Crushing aromatic herbs with every step he took. Spices hung around him. He was a glance from God.\u201d (p.161) And so Janie\u2019s melody is finally listened to and her soul sings cloud-high along Tea Cake\u2019s sweet-scented one while they both stare at the dark waters, while their eyes are watching God. But nature, as life, can be miraculous one minute and treacherous the next, and Janie will have to face the tide of misfortune and swim with courage in order not to be dragged by the relentless currents of injustice and despair.Zora Neale Hurston writes with the vivid force of the unheard and the defeated, revealing uncomfortable truths about race and gender while kissing each one of her words with uncanny lyricism and giving voice to the silenced by the weight of history. The shores are waiting to be shaped by the sea of love and waves of memories will sweep the tragedy of mortality imprinting a permanent image on a never-ending horizon. It\u2019s only a matter of keeping the watch in the darkness, trusting that God is looking back. \u201cLove is lak de sea. It\u2019s uh movin\u2019 thing, but still and all, it takes its shape from de shore it meets, and it\u2019s different with every shore.\u201d (p. 284)"}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "There are two ways to approach this book:1.\tEnjoy the writing! Take in the dialect and try to put yourself in the atmosphere that is created by Hurston\u2019s fantastic prose and poetry. (Side note: The audio version narrated by Ruby Dee only makes this better)2.\tWhile reading, think about this as more of a historical fiction story. Take a moment to read a bit about the South between the Civil War and World War I. How does the end of slavery and the establishment of a free black community in the South affect the progression of the story? What are the attitudes within the black community? I was able to do a bit of both with this. I thought the writing was great. While there were times the dialect and the content caused me to get a little lost, in general I loved getting into the world created by Hurston. While the story was simple, the simple intricacies of the writing were anything but. Sometimes when combining poetical writing into a story it feels forced \u2013 almost like the writer is trying to impress you with their ability to be flowery and fancy. That was not the case here. With this book, the Hurston couldn\u2019t help but combine poetry with her prose.As I was reading I could not help but think about the climate of the Southern United States at the time of this story. I am reading Gone With The Wind at the same time as I am reading this and it really is a great companion story to give additional fuel to my thoughts on where black Americans in the south stood during the Civil War, how they came out of it, and where things were for them going into the 20th century. What is also fascinating is to read about the attitudes within the black community; while we might think that everyone was united in the black community after the Civil War, that was not necessarily the case.If you like historical fiction, stories about American people during different eras, well-written prose combined with well-written poetry, you should check this book out. It is great for either a getaway into great writing, or lots of fuel for a discussion about a volatile era in American history."}, {"userName": "Chloe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70078-chloe", "userReview": "You know those books that sit on your shelf and mock you for being too hesitant to pick them up? We all have them. They sit there, perched on the edge of the shelf like hooligans on a stoop tossing out insults to passersby and just daring them to pick them up and give 'em a spin. For me, Their Eyes Were Watching God was the ringleader of my abusive books. It would yell vicious things at me as I sat near the shelf and once, in collusion with my long-time archenemy gravity, contrived to whap me upside the head. Suffice to say, I was intimidated. Yet we all have to face our fears at some time and February seemed like the right time for me.Looking back on my years-long avoidance of this book, I can't help but think that I make some truly awful decisions. This is one of the most lyrically beautiful books that I have ever read and, at the same time, one of the most ground-breaking portraits of an independent woman's voice that I've ever come across. Neale Hurston's book is simultaneously a work of art and a strong declaration of independence for the entire female gender.Janie is a woman who first tries to conform herself to the molds that she has been taught in the form of two very dissatisfying marriages to men who feel compelled to, after heaping praise upon her for her independent spirit, snuff it completely out. After the death of her second husband, Janie chucks social propriety out the window and listens instead to that niggling voice inside that dares her to dream of a better life, even if the person she wants to share that life with is far beneath her on the limiting rungs of social positioning. Instead this man, the charming and appreciative Tea Cake, is a rascal who cares more about enjoying the everyday moments of life than he does for climbing to the top of the dung heap. His very lack of sober seriousness is what draws Janie to him, his living example proof of what is possible for her.Hurston's style is beautiful, her poetic prose balanced perfectly with spot-on accurate renderings of the rural Southern dialect. J.D. Salinger, who I hold in the absolute highest esteem when it comes to rating dialogue, is put to shame by Hurston's ability to craft the slow drawl and missing consonants in her characters' speech. Reading it can not help but conjure each person's voice within your head so that, after a while, it's as though you're listening to a radio telecast rather than reading a book."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "A Classic That Hasn't Finished Saying What It Has to Say\nSeeing Within You More than Before\nTheir Eyes Were Watching God should be more highly revered as an American classic. Italo Calvino defined a \"classic\" as \"a book that has never finished saying what it has to say.\u201d The current racial turmoil brewing in the United States today leaves no doubt that this Zora Neale Hurston classic still hasn't finished saying what it has to say. Ms. Hurston's decision to attain a verisimilitude by using the lively vernacular of African-Americans in the early 1900s American South transformed this book from a great novel to the lofty status, attributed to very few in the Western Canon, of \"transcendent.\"Reading her piercing, prismatic prose is as soothing and soulful as listening to Etta James sing the blues to the rhythm and flow of Janie Crawford's journey from a pubescent teen given away by her grandmother as wife to an old man (after being caught kissing a boy) to a 17-year-old young lady being swept away by a dapper, fast-talking traveling salesman who, after marriage, became an abusive, chauvinistic husband, and then to a mid-to-late 30s widow finding love, passion and zeal for life in a man named \"Teacake,\" more than a decade her junior.Toward journey's end, Ms. Hurston brews up and heaves at us a hellish hurricane crossing south-central Florida, and breaching the banks of Lake Okeechobee. The passage from which the book's name was derived is both profound and symbolic in describing the African-American denizens of central Florida in the wrath of the hurricane:\u201cIt is so easy to be hopeful in the daytime when you can see the things you wish on. But it was night, it stayed night. Night was striding across nothingness with the whole round world in his hands . . . They sat in company with the others in other shanties, their eyes straining against cruel walls and their souls asking if He meant to measure their puny might against His. They seemed to be staring at the dark, but their eyes were watching God.\u201d Another reason for this novel's transcendence is its place in embedding Ms. Hurston in United States history as a (if not the) pioneer in speaking up for, and celebrating the unique voice of, African-American women, especially in the South. Hurston adroitly conveyed her message in this novel that these women were oppressed not only by whites but also others in their own segregated communities. Perhaps most telling of all to the novel's place among classic social novels was the mainstream's rejection of the novel after its publication in 1937 because it did not play its part in \"racial uplift\".I also rejoice in this novel's importance in showing how first-rate fictional narrative, honest and heartfelt, is not only creative art in its highest form but can also be a potent agent for change across the broader spectrum and one person at a time. A noted publisher/editor at The New Yorker observed that in reading a classic \"you do not see in the book more than you did before, [but] more in you than there was before.\" One of the greatest American novels.

What I hated was the forward in the particular version I read. It was about a conference of women who loved the book or something, and one lady just went on and on how Janie is a strong female character, and something about how the Tea Cakes of the world weren't prepared for them. So, after reading this forward, I went into the book hoping for someone who was this amazing pillar of strength, not some anti man disestablishment type of strength, but someone who at least stood up for themselves. I understand how her strength can be perceived. However from my point of view she was someone who relied heavily on the men around her, never really stood up for herself, and was just lost most of the time. reading this was like watching the idiot babysitter go in to the basement when you KNOW the scary monster is down there. She made decision after decision leaving me thinking...why, why is this woman seen as strong?edit: teacup = Tea Cake, obviously I did not pay attention to the man's name."}, {"userName": "LeAnne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-leanne", "userReview": "I am not African American, and no matter what genuine empathy is in my heart, there is no way a white woman can truly understand the life experiences and the collective family experiences of my girlfriends and guy friends who are in fact black. But reading this classic by Zora Hurston let me pretend to do so for a while.Wow, what a book! When Ms. Hurston, born in 1891 ,wrote this, she had already attended Howard University and Barnard College studying anthropology and attended Columbia for graduate studies in the field. She also taught for some years at North Carolina College for Negroes. She was on the staff of a little place called THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS too. Long story short, for a woman born before the turn of the century, she was amazing. For a woman of color to break through these sorts of barriers during this time in American history? Incredible. Ms Hurston's mom and dad, both former slaves, had to be the proudest parents ever.So when she wrote this story about Janie, granddaughter of a former slave, we might expect some huge accomplishments written about this main character. But Ms. Hurston - always the anthropologist - wrote Janie's story in rural Florida. Although the novel takes place nearly 100 years ago, I can see her description of certain people fitting those living around us today:  \"People ugly from ignorance and broken from being poor...Much of Janie's tale is set in a little town that was founded by, organized by, and lived in by people of color. The town is real, and it is where the author grew up. I grew up in South Florida myself and had no idea! My ignorance of history is shameful.As to the story, we see Janie's life plotted out for her by the grandmother who loves her and wants her protected. But when that protection means being married off to an older man, one Janie does not love but who owns plenty of property, she initially acquiesces but still pines for the feeling of deep love. As a young girl, she lies under a pear tree one spring day smelling the sweet, heady perfume of its blossoms and sees drowsy bees, laden with pollen, as they lumber between the pistols and stamens, nuzzling into the petals. For the rest of her days, this image will define love for Janie. When opportunity arrives by chance to offer her a shot at deep love, Janie does not hesitate, and she goes. Leaves. Sets out for parts unknown, only with those blossoms and nectar to sustain her.I'll skip the plot elements and forego a book report for you, but will comment that one thing that really surprised me was the introduction of a character called Mrs. Turner. She is the voice for, I suppose, a certain section of the black population who prided themselves in those days on their physically Caucasian-looking characteristics. Lighter skin, more aquiline profiles, smoother hair. Although at this section of the book, Janie is a very happily married woman, Mrs. Turner wants to introduce her brother to Janie, as he is as light skinned as she is, and she disregards Janie's husband Tea Cake because of his dark complexion. In real life, I've had conversations touching on this subject with friends who are African American, but it has made me squirm. But reading this book, by myself, allowed me to gawk openly and to wince. No matter how many personal stories my black friends have told me over the years- being shadowed by salespeople at the department store, getting shoddy service from waiters who were overly obsequious to white diners all around, being asked about inner city successes (this was directed to a co-worker friend who had grown up with more money than God - truly affluent - but because she was black, the men in the car with us assumed she had overcome some sort of ghetto nightmare), etc - there is no way for me to walk in their shoes.Thank you, Zora Hurston, for letting me pretend to do so for awhile this week.NOTE: unless you are a native Southerner, reading the text of this book might be a challenge. The author wrote dialogue colloquially and somewhat phonetically, just as was done in Wuthering Heights. I'm not just a Southerner but live in south Louisiana where the \"yat\" accent is commonplace, so after about five pages, it was pretty easy for me to follow. It was the same with me for Wuthering Heights (Irish grandparents and a Scottish step-dad). That said, if reading vernacular that is unfamiliar can cause you to toss the book aside, please check out the FREE AUDIO of this book from Hoopla (you need a library card). Ruby Dee is the narrator, and oh-my-gawd is the audio amazing. If you want to read a classic but are as lazy as I can sometimes be, let Ruby Dee climb into your ears and Zora Hurston crawl into your heart.

A number of readers have indicated they read this novel at least once a year. It is highly probable that I will join their ranks. For it has already joined my list of favorite books. \nZora Neale Hurston (1891-1960)Zora Neale Hurstonpublished Their Eyes Were Watching God in 1937. Consider it a marvel for its time. For it is clearly the first feminist literature by a black author about a woman in search of herself, her voice, and love on her own terms.\nTheir Eyes Were Watching God, First Ed., J.B. Lippincott, 1937Janie Crawford is Hurston's protagonist. Her road to independence is a difficult one. At the age of thirteen, she recognizes the attraction of the opposite sex for the first time. However, her grandmother warns her that sex is a trap for a black woman and only a temporary pleasure. Love, Nanny says, is \"de very prong all us black women gits hung on. Dis love! Dat's just whut's got us uh pulln' and uh haulin' and sweatin' and doin' from can't see in de mornin' till can't see at night.\"To Janie's horror, Nanny has arranged a marriage to for Janie to Logan Killick, a farmer with a home and sixty acres of land. To Nanny, who had been a slave, Killick represents security for her granddaughter, who was a child of rape. Nanny's daughter had been raped by her school teacher, lost herself in a bottle and disappeared. To Nanny, Killick is Janie's ticket to rocking on the porch while Killick provides for her.Janie assents to her Nanny's wishes. Killick, at first, does cater to his young bride. She is a beauty, with thick hair that hangs down her back. Her breasts, buttocks, and legs would attract any man's attention. However, Killick prefers a helpmate rather than a bedmate. He tells Janie he is going to leave home for a day to buy a mule. He intends to put Janie behind a plow to help him plow his land. Enter Jody Stark, a dapperly dressed man, big, handsome, and carrying the promise of sexual romance. He would never put Janie behind a plow. She is a woman to be waited upon. Stark lures her to leave Killick and marry him, also tempting her with travel to Eatonville, Florida, a town built by and for black people. Janie did not consider Stark her ideal, thinking \"\"he did not represent sun-up and pollen and blooming trees, but he spoke for far horizon. He spoke for change and chance.\"\nEatonville, Orange Co. Florida, was the first town founded by blacks following the Emancipation in 1863. It was incorporated in 1887. Zora Neale Hurston grew up there. Only after Janie has married Stark does she consider the eroticism of their relationship in the bedroom, believing \"from now on until death she was going to have flower dust and springtime sprinkled over everything. A bee for her bloom\".Stark becomes a store owner, buys additional acreage for the town and is ultimately elected mayor. He depends on Janie to operate the store while he politics around town. But he does not expect her to have a share of the political podium. Worse, he becomes jealous of Janie after he sees a constituent reach out to softly touch the braid of hair hanging down her back, of which Janie is not even aware. Thereafter, Jody orders Janie that she must conceal her hair under a head rag in public. Nor is she to speak publicly on the issues he deals with as mayor. There is no more flower dust or springtime sprinkled over everything. There is no bee for her bloom. She is only freed by Jody's death from kidney failure, a problem he sought to treat through an herb doctor although Janie had sought a medical doctor for him. Janie is left a wealthy widow.Janie finds that flower dust and springtime over everything with Tea Cake, a man twelve years younger than her. However, time has been kind to Janie Crawford Killick Stark. Tea Cake Woods tells her that her age makes no difference to him, that she is the only woman for him and for her he will give her the keys to the kingdom. Tea Cake is the charmer, the joker, the musician, the blues singer, and the wandering gambler. He is Janie's route to adventure. She is his willing companion every step. When he proposes they head south to the Glades to grow vegetables, Janie wants nothing more.\nLake Okechobee and the GladesBut even Tea Cake is subject to jealousy when it comes to Janie's beauty. The Turners' have a restaurant in the Glades. Mrs. Turner, a light skinned black, is drawn to Janie for her light complexion. She scorns Tea Cake for being too black and offers to introduce her brother to Janie. Janie's not interested. But when Tea Cake gets word that Mrs. Turner is up to introducing someone to take his Janie away from him, he beats her, where the marks show. He frankly admits she had done nothing, but it was necessary that others, especially the Turner's knew he had control of the situation.Hurston's novel builds to a tempestuous climax as a hurricane approaches the Glades. The bean crop is coming in. The pay is $8.00 a day. Tea Cake says they would be fools to leave. They ignore the lines of Seminole Indians walking to the east away from Lake Okechobee. I will only say that Hurston takes her title from the fact that those who remained in the face of the hurricane, listening to the winds swirling around their farmers' shacks were watching to see if their walls and roofs would withstand the force of God. No spoilers here. This is a book that you have to read.Ironically, Hurston's magnificent novel was rejected by literary critics, particularly those male members of the Harlem Renaissance. The most stinging criticism came from Richard Wright who claimed Hurston had created a work which portrayed blacks in a manner to allow whites to laugh at them, particularly using realistic black idiomatic dialog. Neither Wright or his contemporary male authors recognized Hurston's accomplishment of portraying one woman's journey to independence. Perhaps that aim was no more important to them than it was and remains for many men.During her career Hurston obtained two Guggenheim Fellowships and produced additional novels Jonah's Gourd Vine, Moses, Man of the Mountainand works of black folkways: Mules and Men, and Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica. She also published her autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road.Zorah Hurston fell into obscurity by 1950. At the time her last short story was published, she was working as a maid. She worked at menial jobs, and as a substitute teacher. Ultimately she was drawing welfare benefits when she suffered a stroke and was placed in the St. Lucie County Welfare Home.

Smith says \"There is no novel I love more\", and that kind of hyperbole creates very high expectations, but within a few pages I was drawn in to Hurston's world, with its faithful depictions of the lives, speech patterns, loves, hopes and expectations of a rural poor black cast.

Well probably yes, it does, because surely the language would never strike me as richly expressive if those figures of speech were as familiar to me as my own skin. But I do hope I can be exonerated of the second crime: I would certainly not consider this work to be simple and unpretentious, but rather complex, redolent with symbolism, and encompassing more than just one woman's journey to self-determination. The story of the novel's reception is just as fascinating as the tale within: Hurston was buried in an unmarked grave when she died in 1960. The chronology at the back of my version remarks drily: August 1973 Alice Walker discovers and marks Hurston's grave. A symbolic act if ever there was one.

The speech is not easy to follow initially, but is easy to get the hang of if you persist and is well worth the effort.The story of the life and loves of Janie Crawford; told in her own words and in a strong clear voice. It has had a mixed history in terms of reviews. Ralph Ellison criticised its \u201ccalculated burlesque\u201d and others regarded it as not being serious fiction. Then there was the debate about racial uplift and improving image; an approach Hurston rejected. She presented rounded characters with faults and desires and aspirations. Male authors like Ellison and Powers did not seem to \u201cget it\u201d initially; being doubtful it was serious fiction. But that it certainly is. There are autobiographical elements and Hurston had also done her research when she collected folk songs and tales a decade before. The cadences in her writing show she knew what she was about. It is a shame that Hurston did not live long enough to see how appreciated her work would be. This one has been reviewed to death and I\u2019ve nothing new to add; but the story carried me along and I cared about what happened to Janie. The men came and went. Teacake, the best of them, stood out because he didn\u2019t beat her too often! That may be a little simplistic, but for Janie the price of love was clearly, at times, painful. However painful, this is a celebration of life and love/loves against the odds. I have the virago version with a brilliant introduction by Zadie Smith and I think Hurston\u2019s novel has finally found its place in the hearts of readers and the acclaim it deserves."}, {"userName": "Aubrey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey", "userReview": "4.5/5\nShe had been getting ready for her great journey to the horizons in search of people; it was important to all the world that she should find them and they find her. But she had been whipped like a cur dog, and run off down a back road after things.\nWhat do you live for? Love? Security? Money? Hope? There's something to said for any of them in every combination with one another, the melding usually a three of the four legs of a stool that is never quite stable. A great deal of literature is generated by that shakiness, that unsturdy swaying as time sends the legs protruding and withdrawing, thinning and thickening as one attempts to keep their balance in the constant effort to reach. A great deal of debate is generated by those variables in flux, questions of what is worthy of thought, form, and the crying out of the body, mind, and soul.Do you know what should always be given priority in literature all day, every day, factoring in all the issues of both reality and culture, of faith and physical function? I certainly don't. Not even my love of social justice blinds me to the strength of Hurston's beliefs, her desire to see black literature in US reflecting more than the all too consuming racism. Her effort to write with the goal of \"racial health\u2014a sense of black people as complete, complex, undiminished human beings, a sense that is lacking in so much black writing in literature\", as so wonderfully stated by Alice Walker.\nShe got nothing from Jody except what money could buy, and she was giving away what she didn't value.\nI loved Native Son, I'm well aware of Trayvon Martin and the far too many others like him, I appreciate Richard Wright for writing on such a powerful issue that affects the US to this day, but I hate him for his decrying of Hurston and all that she wrote for. He is Jody, capable of great things with his ideas of equality, progress, and men, writer of brilliant sociological treatises and powerful indictments of racism at the expense of only a few 'girlfriends in a refrigerator.' Idealistic as it is to argue for that 'only', foolish as it is to dream beyond the Titan of whites and their institutional oppression of blacks, selfish as it that a story grants love and financial stability to a black woman, the unlikeliest of unlikelihoods, here we are.\n\"They's mighty particular how dese dead folks goes tuh judgment,\" Tea Cake observed to the man working next to him.\"Look lak dey think God don't know nothin' 'bout de Jim Crow law.\"\nWhile racism is factored into the book, it is not allowed to hollow out the heart and reign in the center of things. Here, it is only a single factor in the lives of black people, replete with life, love, every facet of culture from dialect to public life. Perhaps more suspension of disbelief is required for reading such a story where hope is not immediately shackled to threat and made to understand who is king. Perhaps it is the lack of a king that is the most unsettling, his grandiose ideals of money always before love turned on its head by the queen with her own views of a life worth living. Equal rights and financial stability are all very well, but the patriarchy is not the highest one should be hoping for.\n\"...Dat's whut she wanted for me\u2014don't keer whut it cost.

It is a story of historical fiction set in Florida during the first three decades of the 1900s. It is about being a black woman. It is about self- discovery and about love. The story reads as one long extended flashback as Janie, in her forties, talks to her best friend Pheoby Watson. We follow Janie from her youth growing up under the care of her beloved nanny on a Florida plantation, to her first husband\u2019s farm nearby, to the all-black community Eatonville in Orange County, Florida, with her second husband, to the Everglades with her third husband and finally back to Eatonville. Who is Janie when we start and who is she at the end? Race and color and the status of women are central themes too. The flooding around Okeechobee Lake in 1928 is the setting for the conclusion of the story. It is dramatically told. More details about the flood can be found in the well-researched non-fiction book Black Cloud: The Deadly Hurricane of 1928 by Eliot Kleinberg. I recommend it. One chapter in it is devoted to Hurston's life, the novel and how it came to be written.Hurston\u2019s novel is written in dialect. It is her prose that makes this book marvelous. Her dialogs are from real life, or so they seem. Read by Ruby Dee, the audiobook is not hard to follow. I recommend listening to the story rather than reading it. It is told with emotion, both deep sadness and despair as well as joy and happiness. Clearly this is my favorite by Hurston! It is a book that must be experienced.

One such method was by writing fiction that portrayed colored people as racially inferior. In response to such fiction, a second movement was started which sought to show African Americans as perfect, law abiding citizens and that included presenting Black women as something sexless (and thus fight the stereotype that Black women were lacking in 'moral discipline). Janie's second husband and her life with him seems to metaphor -ise this second movement, he was a sort of ideal citizen who brought development to his people - she wasn't happy with himHurston belonged to a third movement, that didn't like the perfect characters of second movement and rather wished to focus on bringing out the prevalent racism in the country. (This movement, like the novel and like so many things too good for their own times failed to gain popularity.) Hurston's characters are thus far from flawless. Both the protogonist, Janie and her final 'true love' Tea Cake (now that is some name!) are far lookist saying things like \"And he stood in the door and paid all the ugly women two dollars not to come in.\" Then, there is another black character who has a racist bad opinion of characters of her own race, thinking they deserve their misfortunes. Janie isn't always the most feminist character, letting herself be dominated and beaten by Tea Cake. There are, moreover, some Whites who are friendly and kind to Jennie and her granny. Hurston's argument wasn't that African Americans or women deserve their rights because they were flawless, but rather they deserve them because they are humans. And so it is simply a novel about an assertive woman in pursuit of true love. Still, the novel itself is full of feminist and anti-racist tones portrayed by the bad treatment that they received.\n \"Honey, de white man is de ruler of everything as fur as Ah been able tuh find out.

That decision is mysterious to me. Their Eyes Were Watching God is of that lauded rank which everyone assumes you've read, I waded into the depths of Ms. Hurston's novel and marveled. It is a time for a confession, dialogue written in dialect can wear on me, especially if I'm knackered. The construction of the novel is intriguing, a woman returns to town after a lengthy absence. She avoids the hecklers and gossips and instead confides in her best friend. The confession doesn't begin with her departure but rather with her earliest memories of living as a black female in the south. Life then becomes a series of adventures, or perhaps men, as each episode appears contoured by the relationship. It isn't a modest affair in terms of detail but there are no children. The unfolding becomes a quest for that spark, time under a tree appreciating the golden hue of pollen and the eternal drone of attraction and creation. This motivation is to move beyond expectations, outside of the limiting circumstances. Sounds like a lot of ambition to me. The concluding scenes in the hurricane offered a confused majesty. Nature's violence upends human design. The inundation of the elements leaves the protagonist quixotic and the reader delighted and weary."}, {"userName": "Beth F.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1310564-beth-f", "userReview": "Except for the scene where Tea Cake combs Janie\u2019s hair and is actually scratching out all her dandruff (ew), I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I loved the writing style. I\u2019m not terribly keen on poetry, per se, but Hurston\u2019s prose felt poetic and many of the sentences beat out a steady rhythm I could almost hear, even reading silently to myself. The dialogue between the characters was it\u2019s stark opposite, using a phonetic dialect commonly used by black people living in the south. Switching back and forth between more traditional English and the spoken dialect slowed me down a little bit so it took me slightly longer to read this book than I\u2019d anticipated, but that\u2019s not a complaint. I really enjoyed it and think that this is one of those books that all women, regardless of race or geography should read at some point in their lives.The main character is a young woman named Janie. She is 17 at the start of the story and living with her elderly grandmother, Nanny Crawford. Her grandmother had been a slave and when the Emancipation Proclamation came down, Nanny walked away with a baby in her arms (Janie\u2019s mother) who had been conceived after Nanny was raped by a white man. When Janie\u2019s mother was a young woman, she was also raped by a white man, which was how Janie was conceived. Shortly after Janie\u2019s birth, her mother ran off and Janie was raised by her grandmother. Since her father and grandfather were white men, Janie\u2019s hair looks different from the hair of other black women. It is smooth and silky and even though Janie isn\u2019t an exceptionally beautiful woman, men are still very attracted to her and her unusual hair. Her skin is also lighter, described as a \u201ccoffee with cream\u201d color. When Janie\u2019s grandmother catches her kissing a no-good young man, she decides it is time for Janie to be married to a respectable man named Logan Killicks who is a wealthy but unattractive farmer and somewhat of a dud in Janie\u2019s opinion. The only reason Janie agreed to the marriage in the first place was out of a sense of duty and obligation to her grandmother. Janie and Logan are only married for a very short time and when Janie finally realizes that she can\u2019t fall in love with Killicks, she runs away with a second man named Jody Starks. Starks was also wealthy, handsome, charismatic and for quite some time, Janie was content in her marriage to him. Jody and Janie moved to Eatonville, FL, an all black town in Florida where Jody was quickly promoted to Mayor. Before too long, Starks became controlling, verbally abusive and even physically abusive to Janie. He forced her to keep her head covered so none of the other men in their neighborhood could admire her \u201cwhite\u201d hair. He frequently scolded her, citing the reason a woman should do whatever her husband told her to do was because women were incapable of thinking for themselves. After 20 years of marriage, Starks dies due to kidney complications and Janie takes over running the store he had opened early in their marriage. Less than a year after Joe Starks passed away, Janie meets and falls in love with a man who is 12 years her junior, Tea Cake Woods. Janie and Tea Cake get married. The relationship is passionate but not without problems. They are faced with jealousy and several issues crop up that seem to stem from the age difference between them. On top of all that, a biracial neighbor named Mrs. Woods begins to harass Janie for her involvement with Tea Cake, basically telling her that he isn\u2019t worth the time because his skin is too dark and that mixed race people with dominant Caucasian features should be \u201cclassed up\u201d and given rights that will both distinguish them from black people and move them closer to the spheres that are traveled by white people. Overall, I thought the book was good. There were certain parts of it that probably could have been fleshed out a bit more and made the book even better. Regardless, the issues covered in the book are something that all Americans will have some reaction to, no matter our personal backgrounds.From a female perspective, the book is about how Janie discovers herself and grows into her own self which is something that all women have to do at some point in our lives. Janie was able to discover herself after three marriages to three different men and that made me think about some of the experiences I\u2019ve had so far in my life in comparison to the experiences other women have been through (sister, mother, grandmother, female friends, etc.). It\u2019s interesting that so many of us \u201cfind\u201d ourselves after being mistreated by men. When you talk to a man about how he discovered himself and what happened when he fully accepted and grew into his manhood, it seldom had anything to do with a woman. But even in our more progressive society, one where women are not second-class citizens, many of us are still in a position where we don\u2019t recognize the power within ourselves to be strong and capable until we\u2019ve been screwed over by a man. I\u2019ve never really considered myself much of a feminist but when I read something like this, it almost makes me feel like a reluctant feminist. It was a very interesting book, one I could see myself rereading in the future."}], "description": "Fair and long-legged, independent and articulate, Janie Crawford sets out to be her own person -- no mean feat for a black woman in the '30s.
