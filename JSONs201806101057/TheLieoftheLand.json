We observe the urban and rural divide through London and Devon. Craig's talent opens up the interior lives of a wide range of characters that render them real and authentic. The disintegration of the marriage of the middle class couple, Quentin and Lottie Bredlin, is beautifully described amidst the straitened financial circumstances they find themselves in, as both experience the loss of their jobs in the recession. This triggers the need to move to Devon for their three children. They experience a culture shock and struggle to adapt. Amidst all the personal turmoil, there is the mystery of why their house was so cheap. In the period of a year, great changes are heralded into the lives of the central characters. The narcissistic Quentin has indulged in extramarital activities that endanger his marriage to Lottie, who feels betrayed and full of anger. They cannot afford to divorce and move to Devon. Lottie reflects on her role as the supportive wife and feels she has a right to so much more. The health visitor, Sally Verity, gives us a glimpse into the state of sheep farming and her desperation to have a child. She goes on to find a discarded baby. Lottie's young teenage son, Xan, finds employment at the local pie factory, a real eye opener. He sees the poverty of workers whilst experiencing minimum wage and zero hour contracts. The factory conditions leave much to be desired and include visceral descriptions of the killing of animals for meat. There are an array of characters, such as a teacher, a midwife, and the family and household of an aging rock star. With the added suspense of an unsolved murder, the family encounter the challenges of revenge, abuse, poverty and violence. Amanda Craig is a talented author whose skills lie in the characters she creates and develops. I love the way she tunes into their personal thoughts, providing us with incisive and nuanced psychological insights into relationships as they undergo change, the breakdown of a marriage, and the family dynamics when there are three children. The novel pertinently compares and contrasts urban and rural life painting a picture of the divisions in Britain whilst providing an adept political and social commentary. The mystery aspects of the story are minor but lend suspense and tension to the novel. A wonderful read that I highly recommend. Thanks to Little, Brown for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Canadian Reader", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2103966-canadian-reader", "userReview": "Craig\u2019s new novel starts out relatively strong, appearing to be a meditation on marriage, Brexit, and the differences between urban and rural living. Sadly, it devolves into a messy melange: part potboiler, part mystery, and part soap opera, with a modicum of moralizing along the way. Lottie, an architect at a large London firm, and Quentin, a well-known journalist, have both lost their jobs. Not only that, their marriage has come apart because Quentin has been unfaithful. No longer able to afford their upscale London home and faced with the unlikelihood of its selling at a good price now, the two decide to rent it out until the real estate market improves. In the meantime, they and their young daughters\u2014Stella, 8, and Rosie, 6, (along with Lottie\u2019s biracial teenaged son, Xan) will retreat to Devon where they can live inexpensively. The goal is to sell the London house in a year\u2019s time at a price that will provide each partner with sufficient capital to acquire more suitable housing. For now, Quentin and Lottie\u2019s relationship is a purely economic one. Forged out of necessity, it ripples with barely contained resentment.Craig asks the reader very early on to accept that her previously upwardly mobile pair, the Bredins\u2014who recently lived high off the hog and could once afford to send their children to pricey private schools\u2014now have few options beyond continuing to live together in the bitter wake of infidelity. Lottie feels betrayed and aggrieved; Quentin believes she\u2019s making too much of his multiple affairs, which to him meant and mean nothing, being mere scratchings of a midlife itch. Okay. . . somewhat reluctantly I accepted Craig\u2019s premise. The Bredins move to a damp farmhouse in rural Devon, discovering soon enough why the rent is so cheap: the previous tenant\u2014a gentle, well-regarded music teacher\u2014was recently murdered in a particularly grisly manner. At this point in the narrative, the author develops Xan\u2019s story. Having failed to gain acceptance into Cambridge, he gets a job at a food processing plant, which requires long hours for a pittance of a wage. A good son who recognizes his mother\u2019s dire financial straits, he hands over a substantial portion of his earnings so that Lottie can pay the bills, even as she watches out for architectural work. Craig writes skillfully about Xan\u2019s experiences on the factory floor. She explores the attitudes and limited prospects of the rural poor, introducing a couple of credible characters who live hand to mouth. She also explores the anti-immigration and anti-government sentiments of people left behind by the central government\u2019s commitment to Europe and the forces of globalization. Craig even provides Xan with a sexy, Polish girlfriend, Katya, who also works at the pie factory. Through her, Craig is able to highlight some aspects of the culture, work ethic, and essential pragmatism of this sometimes resented group of foreigners.Xan\u2019s commitment to the family makes Quentin\u2019s entitlement, laziness, and self-centredness stand out all the more. Quentin contributes little to the the running of the house, using some of his limited funds to pay an apparently deranged housekeeper to do his share of the cleaning and chores. His journalistic prospects have shrunk considerably; his only reliable work is a regular weekly column about life among the country bumpkins, which he writes under a pseudonym. (No one can know just how far he has fallen.) However, Quentin\u2019s allotted word count gradually contracts as his observations about the backwardness and general nastiness of rural life become increasingly bitter. Other characters with more than bit parts in the novel are Lottie\u2019s cultured, German musician mother and Quentin\u2019s aging parents: his dying father, the philandering Hugh (a Ted-Hughes-like poet) and the wise, long-suffering Naomi, who has endured Hugh\u2019s bullying and belittling over the years because, well, . . . . marriage is something you\u2019re in \u201cfor the long haul\u201d and Hugh apparently has made her laugh. Quentin seethes with resentment towards his self-centred father, even as the elderly man rages against the dying of the light. In time, though, he recognizes his similarity to the older man.Another character, Sally Verity, a visiting home midwife in her early forties, allows Craig a further route into the personal lives of people in this small section of Devon. Sally guides young women of limited education through pregnancy and helps them out of postnatal depression, confronting poverty, domestic and child abuse along the way. Married to sheep farmer, Peter, a taciturn, hardworking salt-of-the earth type, Sally participates in many of the farm\u2019s day to day activities, and has a particularly important role during the annual lambing. Sally\u2019s situation allows the author to provide convincing snapshots of farmers\u2019 hard lot in modern Britain. However, the midwife is ironically unable to bear children of her own. Rather than leaving well enough alone, Craig hovers in an almost maudlin manner over her childless character, who so badly wants a baby. Eventually, like a good fairy or a benevolent fertility goddess, the author forcefully steers her plot in ridiculous directions to give Sally what she wants and deserves.So far, so good\u2014or, at least, an acceptable enough story. However, in its last quarter, The Lie of the Land goes entirely off the rails as Craig attempts to resolve her murder-mystery subplot. The disturbed dark fury, Janet Pigeon (aka \u201cMaleficent\u201d by some of the Bredins)\u2014whom Quentin has hired to to do his share of the housework\u2014 also works for the Bredins\u2019 landlord, the famous septuagenarian rock star, Gore Tore, and his family. Janet lives in the gatehouse of Tore\u2019s sprawling, gothic-revival estate, with her overweight slug of a daughter, Dawn. Dawn often accompanies Janet to the Bredin home, where Xan glimpses the ghost of beauty under the young girl\u2019s fat and learns that she is an exceptionally gifted pianist. He recognizes something is very wrong with Dawn and plays a critical role in uncovering what that is. Some may find Craig\u2019s action-packed conclusion satisfying. I did not. It was too much, too late: a final descent into soap-opera-ish melodrama, which ruined what might otherwise have been a reasonably well written piece of social and domestic fiction. I couldn\u2019t hurtle through the novel\u2019s big climax or the concluding sentimental drivel fast enough. I doubt I will read Craig again. I admired her earlier novel Hearts and Minds, but this novel and another of hers I read in the spring have been really disappointing. My rating of this book stayed at a fairly steady 3 or 3.5 stars for more than half of the book, but it took a steep nosedive into \u201c2\u201d territory at the end. I honestly felt I had wasted my time\u2014a lot of it\u2014because this is a BIG book."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Pool", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27950748-jonathan-pool", "userReview": "I read this, my first Amanda Craig, having noticed that The Lie of the Land was being bracketed with recent literature described as post Brexit novels.After due reflection, what are the reasons that explain the outcome of the June 2016 vote, dividing the UK?.I was very impressed with Craig's insights, expressed through fictionalised, but recognisable, urban and rural character studies.In this specific respect (Brexit) I felt that Craig identified feelings that Ali Smith (in  Autumn)  and Anthony Cartwright in The Cut both failed to convey.The contrast in Brexit response that Craig concentrates on is that of central London, and Devon. The two locations are those that reflect much of Craigs own personal life and experience.Brexit aphorisms appear throughout the book:the sheen of superiority that encases London like an impenetrable bubble.

They hate London, the EU, politicians, newspapers- (267)\"All around her are Londoners unaffected by what is being called 'the current economic climate'\"(20)The rest of the novel, family breakup as a consequence of marital infidelity, teenage search for identity, women covering for their weaker menfolk, is written in a lightly entertaining style.The fictional story that wraps around the pithy observations of rural life is standard \"whodunit\" material, and not terribly satisfying.All in all a book I'm pleased to have read, one with a number of recognisable real life characters, and one whose prose flows easily."}, {"userName": "Maya Panika", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1411655-maya-panika", "userReview": "An extraordinarily readable, engaging and gripping tale, but less for its plot than its brilliantly observed and executed look at Britain today. Ostensibly, this is a mystery surrounding a Devon farmhouse - a secret every local knows, but not the once-well-off London family who find themselves living there when hard times strike and they can no longer afford to stay in London - or divorce. Lottie has to stay with her serially unfaithful husband Quentin because they simply cannot afford the inevitable split in assets and income divorce will impose. The plot is nicely done, with twists and mysteries emerging as the tale develops - enough to keep the reader interested. But though it\u2019s the plot that ties everything together and give the tale it purpose, for me, the real story - where all the page-turny interest lies - is in this snapshot of a certain kind of person (liberal, soft-left, middle-class, London), coming from that secure and well-heeled, comfortable world, so secure in its opinions and certainty (dare one say \u2018smug\u2019?) in the righteousness of its opinions, suddenly thrust into a altogether different place. A rural idyll that is (of course) nothing of the kind; where people are forced to work horrible shifts on zero hours contracts and find their wages forced downwards wherever the Poles are in town. The Poles get short shrift too; diligent, prudent and hard working they may be, but they ghettoise themselves, holding themselves apart, deeply contemptuous of the native population and culture and other immigrant groups (as is always the case). Lottie\u2019s son Xan knows his mixed race status makes him an object of local curiosity (but rarely contempt). He sometimes misses London, but in many ways, he is quickest to find his feet in his strange new Devon world. Working long shifts in the pie factory, moving in with a Polish girl, Xan finds his attitudes shifting. He knows why people here voted Leave; he even considers voting UKIP. There\u2019s nothing clumsy in this adjusting of attitudes, to becoming \u2018local\u2019 - it happens slowly, organically, with great skill. It is a beautifully written book, it truly makes one think and see that there truly are two sides to every coin and both may be correct; it\u2019s all a matter of perspective, depending on what side of the coin you\u2019re living on. It\u2019s all down to the writing, which is subtle and clever without ever being difficult. It is this clever craftsmanship melding sociology, attitudes and the questions these things raise - this clever snapshot of modern Britain - that I found most compelling and entertaining."}, {"userName": "Kirsty &#x1f4da;&#x1f4d6;\u2764\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5390112-kirsty-x1f4da-x1f4d6", "userReview": "The book felt so much longer than it actually is without ever feeling like a lot of happening. Then you get near the end and realise you are completely wrong. It really does sneak up on you. There are so many layers to it with various points of view as told by the characters stories but also the viewpoints of city life versus country life.Downsizing after the collapse of their marriage but like many modern day couples unable to afford to actually split up due to housing crisis and rising costs.

All her chapters seem to say the same thing and while her ending played apart in all the big reveal I think a lot of her story could have been dropped.There's a lot of love for these characters and some of them appear in Craig's other works.

I settled down to read this expecting a light-hearted tale relating the trials and tribulations of Quentin and Lottie Bredlin as they desert London and move to Devon in an effort to consolidate their finances and their divorce. I half-expected details of their efforts to settle into a rural community whilst attempting to replicate their lives in the city \u2013 dinner parties, community events, etc. However, I think that this book is so much more than that. I certainly didn\u2019t expect a mystery in the shape of an unsolved murder, or a secret in the shape of Dawn.In fact this has a clever plot, neither trembling with intrigue nor fast-paced with building tension (well, alright a bit near the end relating to Xan) but more of a deliberately paced, seemingly sedate account revealed through the characters. Speaking of which \u2013 on reflection each character had a particular contribution to make (by which I mean they were not there just to pad out the text or add veracity but were intrinsic to the plot). Obviously the main characters are Quentin and Lottie together with their 3 children and they are the vehicle through which the plot unfolds. They are ably supported by a cast of characters ranging from the three sisters (a midwife, a Marie Curie nurse and a teacher), the aging rock star and his young wife and family, their housekeeper and her boyfriend, and her daughter; we also have Quintin\u2019s parents and Lottie\u2019s mother; a very diverse set of people all beautifully drawn, all believable.In addition to all these fascinating strands we learn about the difficulties of being a sheep-farmer; we learn about the production line in a pie factory and the zero-hours contracts of employment for minimum wage which the poor are forced to accept; we are informed about the horrors of slaughtering animals for meat. This is in counterpoint to the fancy lunches, and corporate hospitality of Quintin\u2019s London life-style of the past. Over and above all this we see two women (Lottie and Anne) who reflect on their lives and positions within their marriage and within Society, they are aware that theirs is a supporting role but each are conscious that they not only need, but are entitled to something more.For me this is not a fantastic book, but it is enjoyable and has much more to offer than at first glance. It is not a book to be dismissed as it is multi-layered and a credit to the author.Thank you to the publishers and NetGalley for providing an ARC via my Kindle in return for an honest"}, {"userName": "Poppy fairy ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18322003-poppy-fairy", "userReview": "Quentin and Lottie can't afford to divorce. Lottie sees her redundancy as her husband's fault. Quentin never meant to hurt his wife, but adultery isn't acceptable, when you marry someone. I was shocked to read about both of their lives before they married. For Lottie explaining to the children that mum and dad are separating, is difficult she has to minimise the suffering of her children. With not being able to find the money for a divorce the only option is to rent their house out and move to Devon. Once they move to Devon the strangest of things happen. Although I enjoyed this book I did expect it to be a little bit more in depth about Quentin and Lottie's marriage crisis and not about the strange things that happen in Devon, but then again having said that the strange things that happen in Devon gave this book a different light."}, {"userName": "Beth Bonini", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3106785-beth-bonini", "userReview": "'Inside a great novel, or poem, or play,' he told Xan, 'there is no time, only a place of joy where readers may meet and embrace each other. To share a love of reading is to share the best love of all, because there is no democracy of taste, there is one of feeling.'One sign of how engaged I am with a novel is how quickly I read it - and I read this one (415 pages) in two days. Another sign is how many quotations I write down as I am reading - and for this book, I have pages of them. It was definitely the right book for me at the right time. When I do read a contemporary novel, I appreciate that interplay between what's going on in the world (in this case, post-Brexit England) and how the novel's themes resonate with what's happening in my own life. I'm a huge admirer of Amanda Craig's writing, and I remember being similarly bowled over by her previous novel, Hearts and Minds, which is also set in London. Craig is a sympathetic observer of many strata of society; unlike Dickens, she is not overly sentimental, but she is a highly moral writer. She is equally aware of both the 'haves' and the 'have nots' of the world she describes. One of her main characters, Lottie - a mother, an architect and an unhappy wife - says at one point: 'I like people with a moral compass'. And I agree with her. I also like books with a moral compass; perhaps that's why I so enjoy 19th century novelists like Elizabeth Gaskell and Anthony Trollope. (On his deathbed, the character of Hugh wants to have The Small House of Allington read to him. It's a book that I've recently enjoyed reading and for some reason that little detail delighted me.) Craig writes complicated, nuanced characters, but she never glorifies (or glories in) what is mean and ugly in human nature. For instance, Hugh (poet and father to Quentin) voices the opening quotation; he's so sensitive on one hand, and yet he has also been a selfish philanderer who has damaged his wife and children. The primary storyline concerns Lottie and Quentin and the breakdown of their marriage. Quentin is a journalist and Lottie is an unemployed architect, and job losses and the general financial squeeze means that their only economic asset is their London house. In the short-term, the estranged couple and their three children - the oldest, Xan, being Lottie's son from a youthful one-night stand - are forced into renting their London house and moving to a ridiculously cheap house in Devon. One of the themes of the novel is city vs countryside. While London's citizens are described as house-rich (if they are so lucky to be home-owners) and time-poor, the Devon lifestyle affords different pleasures and restrictions. Various secondary characters add to the richness of the plot: Quentin's father Hugh and his mother Naomi have an important storyline, as does Lottie's mother Marta. For middle-aged readers, sandwiched as they are between the needs of their children and their parents, this aspect of the plot will definitely resonate. There is the strong sense of how parents, and their own decisions and behaviour, affect and shape their children. A rich musician, 'Gore Tore', is a local Devon boy made good, but his indiscriminate womanising has left a trail of pain that impacts both past and present. Another important character is Sally, a health visitor, who is married to a local farmer and longing for a child of her own. Sally has one of those professions which allow her insight into the secrets of people's lives, no matter what their economic or social status, and she ends up being the bridge between various characters in the Devon community.There is also a murder mystery 'buried' in the plot, and I had mixed feelings about this. I don't know if the novel really needed it, but I suspect that it might make the story more 'readable' or interesting for a larger group of readers. What interested me about it was the idea of inheritance: there is definitely a theme of 'the sins of the fathers' which runs through the novel. In the acknowledgements at the end of the book, Craig wants to make it clear that Quentin is in no way modelled on her own husband. Craig's husband may be a paragon among men, but I couldn't help but notice that men are often the source of frustration, pain and betrayal in this novel. 'Men fail us, Sally thinks, because they mostly won't or can't communicate.''However, among men it's as if incuriosity is a badge of honour, with the result that they all go stumbling blindly around in a fog of unknowing.'' . . . it's just that his love lacks the crucial ingredient of imaginative sympathy.'"}, {"userName": "Gumble's Yard", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard", "userReview": "Waking with fortitude, living with compromise and sleeping with stress is normal for an architect in Britain. Even during the best of times, Lottie has spent weeks drawing up plans for prospects over which clients have then backtracked, changed their minds and cancelled. Experience has taught her that nothing is ever built without compromise, and yet she expected better from marriage. For just as we expect sweetness from the milk we first drink, so the child born to a happy union is wholly unprepared for disharmony. Lottie had failed to understand what she risked when marrying Quentin; but then waking with optimism, living with laxity and sleeping without self-reproach is normal for a journalist\nLottie and Quentin\u2019s marriage is on the verge of dissolution, due to irreconcilable differences, principally that Lottie will not accept Quentin\u2019s continuous affairs. However with Lottie being made redundant from her architectural firm and Quentin\u2019s journalistic and TV career as a commentator and columnist almost stopped (the number of enemies his combative style made on the way up, ensuring he receives almost no help on the way down) \u2013 they are struggling financially. The central conceit of the novel is that, while they wait for the London market to pick up enough to enable them to sell their house and raise enough funds for a house each, they let their home and move out to a, strangely cheap even if run-down, farm house in Devon, living off the rental differential.The cast of characters includes: Quentin\u2019s parents \u2013 his long suffering mother and dying father (an ex-teacher at a local private school, a minor poet infamous for his affairs with ex-pupils and for his bad temper and tyrannical parenting style); Xan \u2013 Lottie\u2019s mixed-race child from a one-off encounter when she was younger, struggling to accept his rejection from Cambridge; the Polish girlfriend he meets at the local pie factory \u2013 the only real source of local employment but dominated by immigrants due to its poor environment and zero-hours, minimum wage contracts; Lottie\u2019s German mother \u2013 still living in her run-down but ridiculously valuable house in London; Lottie and Quentin\u2019s two younger daughters; their landlord \u2013 an ageing pop star and his family living in luxury in the nearby country mansion house; is housekeeper Janet (with an odd daughter Dawn \u2013 seemingly once pretty and intelligent, now neither) living in the gatehouse and used as cleaner by Quentin; a local health visitor, tormented by her inability to have children with her small holding sheep farmer husband. \nQuentin had bought colour, humour and fun into her life, just as she bought order, calm and seriousness into his. They shared many interests, and were both the children of teachers. Yet the differences between them have made it clear that no reconciliation is possible.\nDifferences, and how, if at all, they can be reconciled is a key theme to the novel \u2013 between people but also between London and the country, with the Brexit vote ever present in the background and the book serving as an examination in particular of rural alienation.I was reminded, in some ways, of John Lanchester's Capital \u2013 although there is a stronger link between the characters here with Quentin and Lottie and their family completely central to the book, rather than a true multi-narrator approach. What however really lets the book down is the plot constructed around it \u2013 Lottie and Quentin learn early on (although later than a vaguely attentive reader) that the previous inhabitant of their house was decapitated in an unsolved murder. Disappointingly this storyline dominates and spoils the end of the book \u2013 with a rather ridiculous series of melodramatic confrontations and unlikely revelations. I could only help but draw a contrast with the wonderful Reservoir 13 \u2013 another novel of a rural community \u2013 and one which in my experience much better captures the dynamics of such a community. There a dramatic event (the disappearance of a missing girl) is, very cleverly and very unexpectedly for the reader, not resolved, and instead over time its impact fades while never quite disappearing; here by contrast we have an event which could have simply served as some local colour, but whose resolution is effectively forced on the reader against their wishes.As a result \u2013 two books, what could have been a good (if not brilliant) examination of differences and reconciliation; and what could have been an entertaining but throwaway rural mystery; are combined into an unsatisfactory mix."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "From BBC Radio 4 - Book at Bedtime:Amanda Craig's new novel is a state-of-the-nation black comedy that highlights the growing disconnect between life in London and the rest of the country.Quentin and Lottie Bredin, like many modern couples, can't afford to divorce.

Wickedly funny with brilliant characters, I could hardly bear to put it down. The story is about Lottie and Quentin Bredin, who are forced to uproot from London and settle in the wilds of Devon because they can't afford to divorce. Dragged along for the ride are Lottie's son Xan and their young daughters, the precocious Stella and good-natured Rosie. Most of the humour comes from the shock of exchanging their lovely home in the city for an old farmhouse, which is damp and overrun with mice (and, on one occasion, a large rat). Worse still, there's barely any mobile phone signal or Internet. And then the Bredins find out exactly why the house was so cheap to rent - and what happened to the previous tenant ...The joy of this book is in how the characters deal with (or, in some cases, don't deal with) adversity. Lottie is a control freak, trying desperately hard to keep her family from going under while utterly devastated by Quentin's serial infidelity. Quentin is a self-obsessed idiot, who spends the first half of the book trying to claw his way back into the London elite, gatecrashing the parties and clubs where he used to reign supreme. Unfortunately he never spent much time being nice to people on the way up, so they are all quite gleefully watching him get his comeuppance on the way down.Pampered teenager Xan, who has failed to get into Cambridge and sulkily refuses to consider an alternative university, has a horrible shock when he finds out they can't even afford Netflix and he is forced to get a job at the local pie-making factory. (After reading about his adventures, you'll probably never want to eat a ready-made pie again!)The story is told from each viewpoint over the course of a year, with the addition of Sally, a local midwife, who first meets Quentin when his car forces hers into a ditch. Despite this, Sally becomes good friends with Lottie and we also see village life from her more sensible perspective.The plot skillfully covers the harsh realities of divorce, caring for elderly parents, trying to fit into a new community, poverty, infidelity and infertility. Despite the humour, the story was a little dark in places, particularly with regards to the mystery of the previous tenant - and exactly what happens to that meat before it ends up on your table as a Sunday roast. My favourite characters were Xan, who was the first to realise what a sheltered life he'd been leading, and his step-father Quentin - even though Quentin was so horrible: \"Without selfishness, I'll have a life of misery and boredom.\"The Lie of the Land is one of my favourite reads this year. Recommended if you love cleverly written stories about eccentric characters, with a bit of humour and a mystery thrown in.

Lottie decides they should rent out their lovely London home and decamp to Devon for a financial re-group. The kids \u2013 Lottie\u2019s mixed-race son Xan from a youthful brief encounter and two young daughters from the marriage \u2013 are not happy bunnies. Quentin is appalled at the move but as the guilty party has lost his moral authority. Living in an unheated, ramshackle house in the West Country comes as a shock to them all \u2013 the fact that it was the site of a gruesome murder hardly helps to make it any cosier.Amanda Craig threads a number of contrasting themes through her novel: country v. concrete, of course. But also infidelity and blind loyalty, academia and practical life experiences, motherhood and careers, perfection and human flaws, ambition and acceptance, and inevitably given the bucolic setting, nature versus nurture. She\u2019s very good on the descriptive prose and is convincing on the charm (and reality) of living in the countryside.I wasn\u2019t sold on the perfect Lottie who failed to come alive for me but I did rather adore the fact that she called her German-born mother \u201cMutti\u201d \u2013 what an appealing word! For me, the book picked up whenever Quentin hove into view. And who could resist Xan whose caring character gives youth a good name? This novel grew on me more and more before descending into \u201csomething nasty in the woodshed\u201d territory. An enjoyable, undemanding read that also raises some interesting aspects of human behaviour and how life events force us to evolve."}, {"userName": "Rhia (rhiareads...)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21926806-rhia-rhiareads", "userReview": "Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for sending me a fee copy of this ebook, but unfortunately I'm going to have to DNF this at 30%.The author's portrayal of Devon as some kind of backwards community full of idiots and racists is doing my head in. I have lived in Devon for all of my 23 years and never, ever, known an entire community like that. There are, of course, a few backwards, racists locals in every small town or village, not just in Devon, but to suggest a while county of them is , quite frankly, insulting. I honestly feel like the only reason Alexander, Lottie'soldest son, is described as mixed race is so that ignorant locals can ask if he is made of chocolate.Polish immigrants are also painted in a thoroughly unflattering light. Apparently all Polish immigrants must speak very little English, work menial jobs for less than minimum wage, and live in \"slum-like\" house shares with more people than there are bedrooms. Really? I know so many Polish people - including members of my own family - for whom this is simply not true. This kind of portrayal does nothing but add to the stereotype of European workers stealing English jobs.I can't bring myself to care for any of the main characters, even Lottie. The reader is supposed to emphasise with her situation but the author doesn't devote enough time to Lottie's character for me to feel anything for her.I also don't care for the suspense or thriller aspect of the story. The whole premise is that a terrible thing has happened in the house and that's why it's so cheap, but at 30% I've already found out what that terrible event is. I can only assume that the rest of the book is Lottie uncovering the details of the event.I'm sure there are people who will love this, but I am not that person."}, {"userName": "Laura Spira", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36753663-laura-spira", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. Amanda Craig writes superbly, whether she is describing places (in this book, contrasting north London with Devon countryside) or characters (who are brought vividly to life with little physical description but with great attention to their thoughts and emotions). She is very good at conveying the ebb and flow of relationships, the knife-edge balance between love and hate. The disintegration of Lottie and Quentin's marriage is central to the plot: neither is wholly at fault or wholly without blame and they both come to a level of self-recognition through meeting the challenges of downsizing and managing family demands within their unexpected financial constraints. Amanda Craig is very good at conveying middle-class anguish and the family's adaptation to life in the remote Devon countryside is convincing.The chapters are fairly short and the plot moves apace: the story is consistently gripping, although maybe some of the coincidences stretch the reader's credulity a little and the ending is possibly too neat. There are some very touching moments: Quentin dealing with his dying father; the health visitor Sally, yearning for a child of her own, discovering a neglected baby. The book is not part of a sequence and can be read without reading any of her earlier books but it is always a pleasure to encounter characters who have appeared briefly in those, satisfying the reader's wondering about what might have happened to them.

The premise of the story \u2013 he loses his job, she loses hers, so in order to afford to live, they and children move to the country \u2013 together. I found it impossible to suspend belief and accept this because they had lived apart for the previous three years! Or maybe it's just me being too cynical by half that such a thing would happen.It's a pity about this scenario hanging over the whole because there are various vignettes throughout that are worth exploring: the son/step-son wondering what to do with his life having failed to apply to university; the grief of the childless health visitor; sexual harassment in the workplace; the decline and death of ageing parents; faithfulness and forgiveness in marriage \u2013 plus a murder mystery thrown in.Having persisted with this book, it was OK - just.

On the face of it, the story of Quentin and Lottie as they, and their family, come to terms with their marriage breakdown and how to cope with their change in fortunes. Both out of a job and unable to afford a divorce, they rent out their London house and downsize to the Devon, not far from Quentin's aging parents.The move proves to be less than idyllic for Quentin, who still likes to bask in his now fading if not absent glory as a columnist and is now reduced to writing scathing pieces about country life. Meanwhile Lottie draws on reserves of patience and resilience built up over the years of living with the arrogant and adulterous Quentin.The children, as children do, adapt - even Xan - Lottie's mixed race son, who having failed to secure a place at Cambridge sulkily drifts along believing, nowhere else is worth considering. His move to the country, is a coming of age as he really has his eyes opened to the real world after living his rather gilded existence in London. As well as the family drama that ebbs and flows there is also a mystery - the murdered previous tenant of their new-found home. Why was he murdered and as the culprit is still at large, who did it?It's an interesting and engaging plot that in its telling also serves to hold up a mirror to modern British society, it's extremes, it's contrasts and it's shortcomings. It shines a light on the darker side of the rural idyll with a reliance on immigrant workers, the realities of factory farming and the failings of zero hours contracts. A far cry for Lottie and Quentin from the London chattering class they've left behind (somewhat reluctantly in Quentin's case). Though it's not just the countryside under scrutiny, the universal problems of caring for an aging population, the challenges of the housing market (especially in London), infidelity and infertility are also covered. In general it cleverly highlights the town versus country debate as well as the prevailing political, social and economic divisions that in the past couple of years has been increasing bubbling up to the surface and look set to continue to do so.While it starts slowly, it draws you in as you get to know the initial cast of characters and follow them on their journey, along with the wider circle of friends and neighbours that we meet on the way. It's a year that sees assumptions, beliefs, perceptions and relationships challenged in a way that none of them would have foreseen. It's very much a character driven plot with an ending that I doubt anyone saw coming. A thoroughly enjoyable read that I happily recommend."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40405926-stephen", "userReview": "Don't be fooled by the blurb. This is one of those books where trying to summarise the plot (and, to be honest, it's not the most intricate of plots) would not do the writing justice. Because let's be honest - no-one is queuing up to express sympathy for a pair of affluent Londoners who can't manage to sell their expensive house. But it's a premise that has a surprising amount of mileage.I felt like I\u2019d been waiting all year to read a book like The Lie of the Land. It is razor-sharp and bitingly relevant; quotable enough that I felt the urge to highlight every page, and clever, so clever, about a multitude of topics. This is a state-of-the-nation novel like none I've read. Yet despite all this it\u2019s decidedly non-partisan, never forcing an agenda, and while it skilfully melds comedy with drama it only verges on the full-blown satirical once or twice. In particular it has a lot of fun exploring the gulf between liberalistic Londoners and everyone else (\"[being mixed-race] was normal in London, like voting Labour\") exemplified in the struggle of squabbling couple Quentin and Lottie to settle into muddy, poverty-stricken Devon.There were a few places where I wished it could have gone a little further, particularly in its oddly sparing attitude to sex. But that\u2019s the beauty of the writing style in a way: it manages to be explicit and muted at the same time, invoking a whole page\u2019s worth of connotations with a single line. I found myself recognising so many little details while reading: in many ways it feels like an excoriation of modern Britain, in which no-one is spared from Craig\u2019s unflinching wit. The novel never feels more true-to-life than when highlighting racial tension (in a much more explicit way than British novels tend to), and in highlighting the increasing polarisation and inequality that finally boiled over in the wake of Brexit (the word itself thankfully only mentioned once).But what I liked most about The Lie of the Land is how despite its length hardly a word feels wasted. It's not all pontificating, either: there's an element of mystery thrown in, with a truly nail-biting climax (I winced more than once, always a good sign). But it\u2019s the final scene that\u2019s worth getting to. Though I would have stuck around for another hundred pages.

The option they take is to rent out their house in London and move to Devon and a really cheap farmhouse that they can afford to rent themselves. Ding ding ding goes the warning bells as to why the property is at a give away price to rent, but all the Bredins see is a place that allows them to keep their heads above water financially.The story does start with a bit of a slow burn that builds up sneakily on you so you don\u2019t want to put it down. It is never racy more on the side of intriguing as it follows the family over a year where at the end they have all changed so much that there would be no back tracking.Everyone knows everyone and of course everyone knows why the farmhouse is so cheap. Terrible things have happened here including a murder that is still unsolved. The acceptance of each of the family members of moving from London and their life style there and moving on to a new life in the countryside happens at different times. It is more of an internal battle of this is how it has got to be then a wanting to change.There are quite a few personal story lines which are all interwoven one way or another.

That is the position that Lottie Bredin finds herself in after she catches Quentin sleeping around. She's lost her job as an architect in London and his journalist skills are no longer needed - the only solution is to rent out their London house and move down to rural Devon where they can afford a run-down house in the sticks.Along with their two children and a teenage half-black son from a brief encounter when Lottie was much younger, they must fit in with an established community, very different from their London friends. The area is poor and there's almost no work available apart from a pie manufacturing plant. Their rent is low, but there's a reason for that - which none of the villagers will mention.They set themselves a year, after which the house in London will be sold and they can separate. During that time there are various tensions and a who-done-it, to add interest to the narrative.Apart from the who-done-it, which seemed to miraculously fall into place at the end, the rest of the book had rather a soap opera feel, not really 'a suspenseful black comedy' as described in the blurb.

I re-read the blurb and wasn\u2019t sure on second reading if it was a book I was really going to enjoy.I\u2019m glad to say that I was able to prove myself wrong.This is a great book!The characters were brilliant, each endearing and flawed with some leaning more one way than the other. Throughout the book we get to hear from Quentin, Lottie, Xan, and Sally, I enjoyed getting to see from all the characters perspectives. It gave the story a lot more depth as you were able to see how the demise of a relationship affects all the different characters but also how it appears from people on the outside.At the heart of this story is relationships, how they are built and broken and how that is overcome. It takes a look at what really makes a marriage and how the choices you make don\u2019t just impact you, especially when part of a family. This is most visible in the relationship between Quentin and his father, who finds himself following in his father\u2019s footsteps even though he despises his father for his past behaviour. As Ms. Craig put it at the event \u2013 it\u2019s not just your own life you\u2019re trashing it passes down to the next generation.There is also a lot about the differences between the city and the country and the prejudices that people have over each. It was really interesting to hear that this was inspired by the author\u2019s own move to the country and how she was faced with people coming to her door asking for jobs because times were so hard. There were points that the divide was maybe made a little extreme for dramatic value but overall it provided a fascinating backdrop to the story.There is an element of mystery throughout the book and I have to say I had it half figured out fairly early on, but I think because the plot wasn\u2019t resting on this one part of the story I didn\u2019t feel that sting of disappointment, that I would if it were a crime or thriller novel. Instead, I enjoyed getting to see how the reveal was going to be set up and then, of course, the motivations behind what happened.This isn\u2019t a fast paced book, instead, it draws you in and the deeper you get into the story the more it picks up or maybe it\u2019s just that by that point you are so engrossed that that\u2019s what it feels like.The Lie Of The Land is a book that surprised me, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I went through a range of emotions reading this book, from getting a bit misty eyed, to laughing, to being on the edge of my seat.
