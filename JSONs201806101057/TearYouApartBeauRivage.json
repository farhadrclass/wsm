The first book was Kill Me Softly and this book is probably easier to follow if you have read it. You get more of the why the curses exist if you've read the first one. Liv aka Snow White is a spoiled little brat. She is so afraid of her curse that she treats her boyfriend (who has been her friend since a young age) like dog ca-ca. She wants him..she doesn't want him...she flirts with other guys to show him she doesn't want him. GAG!\nShe keeps thinking about how he is to kill her and her savior prince will come.\nShe got on my frigging nerves. Her evil stepmother Regina. (Biggest stupid ass mistake giving her the same name as the OUAT character) has decided that Liv needs to die in order for herself to live.\n*The one I fangirl over is much, much cooler*So little stupid Liv gets an invitation to the Underworld where she meets her happily ever after prince. Um yeah, that's how it never works out.The story does have several other characters involved and it is very readable..and for some reason I sorta like these books. I'll read the next in the series. I'm hoping it's Beauty and the Beast just because the Beast guy is one of the few with any sense..or Jack the Giant slayer (yeah baby)If you enjoy fairy tale re-tellings you might like these books. Or you might not. I could just be drunk.You might just want to read them to figure how this guy plays in...\nI received an arc copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "I'm not giving this 2 stars because it's unreadable or unbelievably boring.I'm giving it 2 stars because I couldn't find many redeeming qualities in the characters or the story.I really enjoyed Cross' first book in this world, Kill Me Softly. It was darker than most of the fairytales I'd read, and I thought the world itself was very cool.Viv was a minor character from that one, and I wanted to see what happened to her.Yeah, now I'm wishing I hadn't.Viv is living under a Snow White curse. She and the people around her are destined to play out some form of the Snow White story. Her stepmother was cursed to be evil, and her best friend from childhood (now her boyfriend), Henley, has been cursed to be her Huntsman.So.Either he will eventually give in to her stepmother's wishes (and kill her), or he will let her escape (and lose her to her Prince Charming). He swears he will never hurt her, but Viv lives in fear of what will happen when he's faced with that choice.Alright.sighIf their relationship is one of those \"We shouldn't be together, but our love is strong enough to overcome anything\", kind of things?Yeah. I could get behind that.However, this was, by far, the most toxic relationship I can ever remember coming across in a young adult novel.Viv is constantly doing and saying horrible things to Henley throughout the book.She makes out with boys he has no interest in just to hurt him, and then within hours runs back into his arms. She knows she's being selfish and terrible...but, darn it, she just can't seem to let him go.Mmmmm. See, if one of my boys run into a girl like that, my advice would be this:Run, don't walk, as far away from this person as you can get.Yes, I know you want to help them, to fix them...You can't. Nobody, not even a trained psychologist can unless they commit themselves to getting help. This person will drain you, drag you down, break your heart, leave you bleeding on the side of the road, and then twist it around until you think it's your fault.And, quite honestly, I don't want to spend the rest of my life in jail for strangling your psycho girlfriend.Poor Henley, right?sighYeah, not so much.Wanna know what he did when he saw her making out with some random idiot?He takes a shovel to the guy's car in a fit of blind rage. He's so scary, that Viv doesn't dare to approach him.\nAnd this is the guy we're supposed to be rooting for?!\nAre we expected to look past this kind of behavior...because she made him do it?Hi, Girls!This is your mother. If at any point in your relationship with a man, he displays jealous and/or violent tendencies? GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!!!Again, Mommy doesn't want to end up in prison...The rest of the story?It mostly held my interest, but it wasn't awesome enough to overcome the above-mentioned flaws.Boys and Girls, you will not get your Happily Ever After with a person who acts like Viv or Henley.And I'm more than a little angry that this book seemed to promote the idea you could.If you loved this one, GREAT!But the only reason I didn't 1 star it, was because it truly wasn't badly written.Thank you NetGalley!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis.

You know you do.\u201d\nI even liked Jasper, Henley\u2019s rival for Viv, especially the way he flirted with her when he first met her, and tried to get her to be his princess!\n\u201cI don't get it.\" She gestured to the crowd of dancing princesses and princes, and the twelfth princess in particular. \"Don't you have a princess already?\"\"The twelve dancing princesses curse isn't mine.\"\"Then... what is your curse?

I loved the 12 dancing princesses, the girl who was forced to be silent and knit nettle jumpers to save her brothers who had been turned into swans, the girl who coughed up flowers and jewels every time she spoke, and even Rumpelstiltskin! I liked how we got lots of little twists in the story, lots of obstacles to overcome, and lots of evil people trying to stop Viv from getting her happily ever after! The romance in this was just great! I loved Viv and Henley together, and even when they weren\u2019t being romantic with one another, their feelings shone through so strongly! You could just tell how much Viv wanted Henley, even though she knew she could never have him, and Henley\u2019s pain over losing Viv was just heart-breaking.\n\u201cHe stroked her hair back from her face. Let his fingertips linger on her cheek. Waiting for something? But she gave him nothing. She didn\u2019t know what to give.\u201cNight, Viv,\u201d He said finally.\u201cGood night,\u201d she said.His steps were softer as he left. He closed the door, and she touched her face where he\u2019d touched it, knowing she wouldn\u2019t sleep for hours. Because he was gone.\u201d\nThe ending to this was so good!

The concept was interesting but I did find it hard to wrap my head around at times. There was also a lot of fairy tale characters in this novel and the author assumed that the reader knew every tale, therefore not bothering to explain a lot of their stories.I found the main character Vivian to be an annoying spoiled brat who treated her on again off again boyfriend like shit. I found it hard to feel any sympathy towards her and she acted so entitled all the time. I loved Henley(the huntsman and her love interest), he was way too good for Vivian and because of this my view of him dimmed a little when he started becoming a doormat.There was also some weird plot holes involving the curses that I can't explain without spoiling the story.Overall decent read but I would suggest picking this up from the library rather than buying. If you are a fan of retellings though you will probably enjoy this more.Note: I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Summer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14778159-summer", "userReview": "I had to suppress the urge multiple times to roll my eyes throughout Tear You Apart. I didn't have a very good reading experience, and there's only so much drama and ridiculousness I can handle in a book before I lose it. Wayyyy too much girl-on-girl hatred, lots of selfishness, bad choices galore, and a retelling that isn't even that unique. Viv is an insufferable brat who constantly bathes in self-pity whilst I forced myself to endure her long-winded complaint sprees. Good lawd, if she is the \"fairest in the land,\" imagine everyone else?The only thing that's preventing me from one-starring this is that underneath the pointless drama and snobbery, there were some parts of the story that were done right.

When done right. Unfortunately, more often than not the fairytale gets sort of short sided (cough, having a movie with you\u2019re starring character being portrayed by K Stew is never a good thing, cough). So anytime there\u2019s a YA retelling of Snow\u2019s slightly demented story I\u2019m game just like a demented dwarf is game to let in an extremely stupid princess into their house.Even if it\u2019s by an author whose previous work I was less than thrilled with.Yeah, I\u2019m talking about the first retelling in this so called series. Not that great. But after reading this installment, I think the fact that it involved a different character and wasn\u2019t so much of an origin story helped it immensely.It didn\u2019t mean it was free of problems though.Oh, I still got annoyed with this one and it\u2019s five million plot holes and lack of sensitivity, but after much thought I\u2019m still giving it an average rating because it wasn\u2019t that bad.And man, I hate saying it. It wasn\u2019t that bad.It\u2019s almost like, well, I really have nothing nice to say so I\u2019m just going to say it wasn\u2019t bloody murder inducing awful.So, I\u2019m going to try to focus on the good. I liked the mish mash of fairytales it made this one a little bit more exciting. Sure, the two main villains had sort of a lot to live up to if you watched Once Upon a Time (especially since the stepmother has the same exact name as the Evil Queen on that show), but they held up well enough. Though I have to admit I was sort of unhappy with the resolution of Regina\u2019s arc. I know it was realistic, especially considering everything she did\u2026but I just hoped.And I guess that\u2019s a good thing, that I felt things for these characters. With the prior installment I just thought. Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.And while I felt that occasionally here, it wasn\u2019t as bad.While the romance played a role in the book, it took a backseat to all the fairytale drama and that was nice. Honestly, Henley and Viv were just sort of meh to me. Not terrible, but not great. So, I was sort of okay with them. It was the secondary love interest I had a problem with.Man, does Cross like to make the loser in a love triangle a psychopath. And unmemorable too, since it\u2019s really his daddy who has to take the role of the psycho since this guy is just weak. Weak to the point of being a psycho.Though, given the fact a lot of these characters had violent mood swings I can\u2019t be that mean to him.I think with this book if you take with you that it\u2019s going to be deeply flawed, you\u2019ll be able to tolerate it. The characters aren\u2019t that great but if you love fairytales this one is a good quick read. It\u2019s better than the first book. While the main character is a bit of an idiot, she isn\u2019t as big as an idiot as the prior heroine. The male lead is also a lot more tolerable. But it\u2019s no Cinder."}, {"userName": "Lindsay Cummings", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729981-lindsay-cummings", "userReview": "So fun!! literally read it in less than 24 hours! :) This is my first Sarah Cross book. I had no idea what to expect, but I've seen some great reviews of her work in the past, so I was super excited to read TEAR YOU APART.From what I've read on other reviews, this is sort of a \"companion\" novel to KILL ME SOFTLY. I hadn't read KILL ME SOFTLY, so I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to connect to the characters in this one--but that didn't happen at all! I loved this book, I loved (and hated) the characters, and I am SO excited for this one to hit shelves.Fairytales are one of my favorite things, but fairytale mashups, or \"broken\" fairytales, are even cooler! I recently read and loved STITCHING SNOW (by RC Lewis), as well as CINDER and the entire series by Marissa Meyer. I think readers who loved those will love TEAR YOU APART.It starts out with our main character, Viv, who has a \"snow white\" curse. This means that, at some point in her life, she's destined to be murdered by the huntsman, or put to an endless sleep by her evil stepmother. In this book, the stepmother is seriously evil, and a little bit MILF-ish *yeah, I just said MILF), and it's hilarious! A perfect way to turn the evil stepmother character on its head. The huntsman is Viv's lifelong best friend and true love...which also creates some pretty interesting moments between the two of them.When Viv is finally scared for her life that she's going to either die or be \"put to sleep\", she goes to the Underworld. This setting is awesome, because it's basically the typical Underworld setting that we know about from stories, but inside of the castle, there's a constant ball. The \"dancing princess\" fairytale is in here, and this is where Viv meets her Prince Charming. In the stories, Prince Charming is supposed to be...well, charming. But in this story--and I won't spoil it---I think readers will have mixed feelings towards him. And it's meant to be that way!Overall, I won't give much away, because this book is full of lots of fun twists and turns and curses and secrets...but I loved it! If you're a fan of ONCE UPON A TIME, CINDER, or anything fairtytale-esque, pick this one up!"}, {"userName": "Faye", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25137110-faye", "userReview": "There are some things that I\"m just a complete sucker for in books. One is fairytales. And Tear You Apart is a medley of many different fairytales, but unlike some books, it manages to work very well.This wasn't a bad book, but could definitely use some explanations. So first off, there's Vivian. She's actually really annoying at the beginning. She's like a huge sorry-not-sorry type of person, but with her beauty. I'm supposed to not look pretty so my stepmother won't be jealous, but I can't HELP looking so pretty! She's really stubborn, and the Henley, who's the only guy that really really cares for her-she's always pushing him away and toying with him. Vivian has character development throughout the book, but at the beginning, I really wanted to slap some sense into her. I loved seeing characters from [book: Kill me Softly} make appearances in this book as well. And although this may be something small, it really pissed me off-Mira, the main character of the last book, just had a few filler lines, and those lines were actually rather annoying. And on a sidenote, if Sarah Cross decides to write another novel in the Beau Rivage world, she should write one with Rafe and Layla, because I have a thing for bad boys in books. There were also some things that I really liked-the mystery of the underworld was really interesting and I liked the huge reveal at the end. The story was also well-paced, and the story overall was very readable.

Whether you wished to be a princess in a tower awaiting your price to come and rescue you, or a evil queen bent on ruling the world. We all love the idea of having our happily ever after. In the city of Beau Rivage fairy tales are real. The people of the Beau Rivage all are blessed or rather cused with one fairy tale or another. Vivian has the \"Snow White\" curse. We all know her story well. But what if the hired huntsman who is suppose to cut out her heart happens to be the love of her life. Hently and Viv have been friends all of their lives and now are in love. Hently knows what his curse says for him to do but is determined to find a way not to, for there is no way he could ever hurt the girl he loves. Regina, Vivian's stepmother aka \"The Evil Queen\" is bent on killing Viv so she may be the fairest of the all. She will do whatever it takes to convince or force Hently to do what he is meant for, to cut out Viv's heart. Soon she becomes tired of waiting and decided to hire another huntsman to do the job for Hently. In the course of stopping the other huntsman from killing Viv, Hently disappears and is presumed dead. Viv is beside herself with grief and worry. Soon after an unexpected invitation arrives addressed to Viv to a underworld party which soon after lands her in a whole other world of problems. With turn of events, Viv now finds herself trapped in the underworld, like many others have come to be. Now Viv must find away to escape....but \"someone\" won't let her leave...To find out who and if she finally has her happily ever after, read the book!First let me say I adored Kill Me Softly when I read it the beginning of 2012. When I found out that there was going to be another book in the series I was ecstatic! I knew I NEEDED to read it and ASAP. There was without a shadow of a doubt that once again I would adore the next book in the series. It was everything and more that I was expecting it to be. There was romance, mystery, adventure, and good vs evil. Tear you Apart was beautifully breath-taking and oh-so magical! I feel in love with the characters, the storyline and the enchanting world Sarah Cross crafted so perfectly around them. There were twists and turns I never saw coming. I laughed, cried, and cheered on Viv for she most definitely deserved her happy ending. One other thing I really enjoyed about the book was how the characters from Kill Me Softy all made cameos in this book, and for the most part played much larger roles in Tear Me Apart than I expected them to. I felt they all blended well into the Snow White storyline and how the ending pans out. Tear You Apart was so far my favorite book of this year.If you're going to read one fairy-tale retelling in 2015, TEAR YOU APART by Sarah Cross is absolutely the way to go."}, {"userName": "Liviania", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1430644-liviania", "userReview": "EgmontUSA may be shutting down, but at least they're releasing their 2015 slate. The first one I just had to read is TEAR YOU APART, the companion to KILL ME SOFTLY. The first book introduced Beau Rivage, the town where descendants of faerie-human unions are forced to live out curses, curses worse than living in Mississippi for the rest of your life.One of the big differences between TEAR YOU APART and KILL ME SOFTLY is that Viv grew up in Beau Rivage. She knows exactly what story she's living, and she fears it. She is Snow White, which means the Huntsman Henley will either kill or save her. If he saves her, her stepmother Regina will keep trying. Once Viv loved both Regina and Henley. But when Regina betrayed her true colors and Henley was cursed, Viv decided she couldn't trust anyone. She can't keep herself from Henley, but she can't bring herself to trust him again either.TEAR YOU APART weaves together \"Snow White,\" \"The Twelve Dancing Princesses,\" and \"Rumpelstiltskin\" in a darkly romantic tale. Viv can be an utter spoiled brat, but getting out of her comfort zone and talking to people really forces her to take measure of her life. And even when she's in spoiled brat mode, I admire her dedication to her own survival. I liked the romance between her and Henley, but liked that she takes a chance when her prince Jasper shows up. Even more, I like that she grows into being her own rescuer (as much as she can).TEAR YOU APART will satisfy fans of fairytales who aren't afraid of some rather large liberties and some of the darker endings remaining in place. Fans of KILL ME SOFTLY will enjoy that the cast of that novel makes cameo appearances. Also nice: a reoccurring character is confirmed as a lesbian and there is a princess and princess couple that no one remarks upon. Little details like that help the updated fairytale concept really work."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28146201-amanda", "userReview": "3.5 stars This was the first fairy tale re-telling I've ever read. This book exceeded my expectations. I really enjoyed the modern twist on Snow White and how other fairy tales were woven into the story. At times I found the writing a bit comical. This story has really peaked my interest in the Grimm fairy tales.I found myself a bit annoyed with Viv at times. Her actions pissed me off a lot. I found her rather self-centered and spoiled. I feel as if she took Henley for granted and then expected him to be there for her. I don't think she treated him right, she doesn't deserve someone like him. Although he does have some anger issues of his own.I also think that too many characters were introduced too fast. I had a hard time remembering who was who.

It\u2019s not a pleasant one. She\u2019s doomed to one of two lives \u2014 one in which her love, who was deemed the Huntsman, kills her, or one in which he lets her live on only to watch her marry another. When she gets an invitation to the underworld, she meets the boy cursed to be her prince, who offers her a safe haven in his palace where they can delay the inevitable. But try as she might, Viv is not in love with Jasper. She\u2019s in love with the one who will cut out her heart or leave her forever. Which choice is better? Is there any way to break her curse, or is fate something that cannot be escaped?I\u2019ve been stuck with Tear You Apart for months. At one point, it took weeks to get from 30 percent to 35. Here I am, at 60 percent, after trudging my way through each never-ending page. I accept defeat. I simply am not enjoying the book. I no longer care for how Viv\u2019s life ends up. Honestly? I\u2019d be fine if she died in the end in an unexpected twist. At least it would be interesting. I have no interest in the characters, the plotline, or the world. I bear them no ill will, either \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a problem with me hating the book, it was a problem with me being unable to find a reason to read on. I can say with complete honesty that Tear You Apart bored my socks off. I can also say that is the first and last time I will ever use that figure of speech. My review today will be short and sweet, because I have no interest on dwelling on this failed read any longer than necessary.Vivian was a boring character to me. She was dull. She whined. She invoked the only emotion I felt with anyone in this story: irritation. She constantly withered in her self-pity bubble. No one or nothing else really mattered but her plight. She was pointless and I didn\u2019t find a sliver of connection between me and Viv. Isn\u2019t she supposed to be caring about the birdies and the dwarves, being Snow White? Nah, she\u2019ll just be sad about herself. Her relationship with Huntley was where I really started to dislike her. She was so unkind to him! They have a history, and she\u2019s not helping her whole \u201cdon\u2019t kill me\u201d case by pushing him away and being generally bitchy, forgive my language. Maybe if I had stuck it out for the rest of the book, I might have seen Vivian\u2019s redemption, but I just can\u2019t imagine a world in which Vivian and Huntley (whom she \u201cloves\u201d) are a good couple.The wicked stepmother was the only character in the story whom I liked. She had motivations, and a backstory to match. Her intentions were evil, but there were underlying themes to her character, perhaps the one thing in the book done right. Viv is so hypocritical concerning Regina, (they mooched the Once Upon a Time stepmother name!) going off and off about how she didn\u2019t choose her curse, when Regina didn\u2019t either. She grew up believing she was Snow White. Do you think she felt happy knowing that she\u2019d been labeled evil? It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. She didn\u2019t have the most pleasant life either. She gave into darkness to protect the part of her that hurt so badly when she heard of her husband cheating on her, or heard the mirror tell her that Vivian was prettier than she was.Okay, altogether, not my favorite novel. There were barely any merits that I can name. I was so bored! The pacing seemed slow. And there\u2019s this beautiful, horrible, unique world, one that (had it been done better) I would have appreciated. It was like the Once Upon a Time world with more modern technology and multiple versions of the same characters. I wasn\u2019t able to enjoy the world. Maybe the fact that I didn\u2019t read Kill Me Softly before I read this changed my opinion, because I know many people loved that one. Oh, and this book almost became the only book that\u2019s ever put me to sleep! Congratulations! I was reading Tear You Apart and then realized the book was slipping from my hands and my eyes were closing. I snapped out of it and turned off the Kindle to protect its battery life before giving into the snooze fest. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this unless you liked Kill Me Softly. Perhaps you\u2019ll like this one as well.Notable Scene:True love\u2019s kiss was supposed to be natural between a cursed prince and princess. You were supposed to feel like you\u2019d known each other a lifetime. But Viv knew what it felt like to know someone your whole life and to love him, and it didn\u2019t feel like this.Fate and magic were supposed to bind them together, but she felt like her heart had been cut from her chest.FTC Advisory: EgmontUSA provided me with a copy of Tear You Apart.

The tangled fairytale world is super intriguing, and the main character, self-destructive as she is, acts in a consistent, understandable (if frustrating) way.At the core of this book is a deeply fucked-up relationship between a girl with a Snow White curse and the boy doomed to be her Huntsman (as in, the guy who cuts her heart out). So there's a lot of push and pull between this physically defenseless girl and her hyper-strong on again, off again boyfriend, with loads of alternately teasing and threatening talk about how he may or may not end up killing her.But it's not an unexamined fucked up dynamic. I think Cross is, in a way she didn't in book one, using her updates to poke at the creepy historical realities and archetypes fairy tales rely on. But the book is also really FUN, wildly inventive and total catnip for fairy-tale fans. The Twelve Dancing Princesses are in there, and I'm pretty sure Cross and I read the same version at some point, because their underworld looks just like I remember it did in, I think, Andrew Lang's fairy books. Tear You Apart is smart and self-aware and fascinating, and I'm kinda heartbroken Cross never published the planned third book in the series."}, {"userName": "Trisha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1238273-trisha", "userReview": "This wasn't at all what I was expecting.Don't crack these pages looking to read about another princess to love!

But you needn't be concerned that will happen to you. If you go mad, it will be for other reasons.\"~ page 234 (ARC)MY REVIEWOne of the most believable and amazing retellings! Incarnating popular fairytales into twisted modern classics, TEAR YOU APART is thought-provoking, eerie and fun...Our modern-day Snow White, Viv, is constantly reminded of what soon awaits for her - her stepmothers wish for her heart to be carved out by the Huntsman. It has been a threat weighing over her for many years now, one that she has learned to accept. Until recently. When her best friend, Henley, turned true love, is cursed with having to live out what is to be Viv's tragic ending. Even with Henley's promise to never hurt her, a curse cannot be removed nor broken. But Henley is determined to to fulfill his promise and protect her as best as he can... Due to these circumstances, there relationship has taken an interesting love/hate turn, but, in the end, Viv puts a lot of trust into Henley and feels that he will follow his heart and not what the curse will force him to do. In the meantime, it seems that Viv does not know how to be around Henley. She is short tempered and rude. And having been abandoned by her father, because he can't handle the curse that has been laid upon her, and being left with a crazed stepmother - who can blame her for being a spoiled brat with a bitchy attitude. She has every right to be anyway she needs to be in order to keep her sanity.And by now we know that for every doomed princess there is a charming prince who is said to be her savior.Our prince, Jasper, lives in the Underworld. Yes, that place, down below. His family is cursed to be those who somewhat save the Twelve Dancing Princesses. They're the ones that dance and dance with the princesses, endlessly... Jasper is, to say the least, different and crude. And definitely not my favorite. But he was so well put together. I truly didn't expect him to be what he turned out to be. I do have to admit, the love-triangle thing hardly felt like one. And I do love how things end. Ooooh, and let's not forget the Rumplestiltskin twisty thing that happened...There are many hidden fairytale innuendos as well as hilarious moments. I did laugh out loud a few times. Even with that, the story is dark. The characters are very complex and at times hard to swallow. The male characters are all very cruel and possessive at times. I had to keep reminding myself that they are under unbreakable curses, and that took a huge toll on their temperaments and qualities. But does can sinister curses excuse all of their horrible behaviors?A definite new favorite! I highly recommend this to all who love fairytales, retellings and even those that love contemporary with a magical/paranormal twist! There is diversity and a ton of complex characters... However, it will help you better understand the main plot of the story if you are familiar with the main fairytales mentioned above.*An ARC was sent to me from the publisher for an honest review.

Forced to go to the underworld in search of help, Viv realizes that to love another, she must lay her heart to rest..What I enjoyed:-I was so very happy when I heard there was another tale coming out in this series, because I was enchanted with Kill Me Softly-The creepy town of Beau Rivage, which is dark and magical--with descendants of Cursed springing up everywhereWhat could've been better:-I didn't really like the way relationships were portrayed in this book--Viv was always toying with someone's heart, because she was a jaded Cursed girl-I liked Henley, but his dark, dangerous obsession with Viv really freaked me out in the end-Jasper--the fact that Viv would stay with someone so obviously abusive made me very angry and upset-I would've liked the fairy tale retelling--I love things that are dark, but the cliche young adult tropes that seem rampant in those kinds of novels these days (love triangles, unhealthy relationships) really put me off of the actual storyTear You Apart was just not for me.

Viv lives in a world of the wealthy, where curses can be bought and the roles are played out by those involved in your life. Viv becomes Snow White, her boyfriend The Huntman instead of the Prince\u2026 and her stepmother must play out her role as well. An interesting concept and one that I enjoyed, but I did hate Viv so much\u2026 she was spoiled, toyed with her boyfriend whenever she felt insecure and still wanted the perfect happily ever after.As much as I disliked Viv, I really enjoyed the other characters. Especially the twisted history of her stepmother Regina (Um\u2026 Once Upon a Time much?), who is not completely evil, but thrown into this just like the rest of the characters. Even the Prince was more than he seemed, which was nice in a sense. I really didn\u2019t want this to become a hardcore love triangle problem on top of all the other things going on. Viv was the most straight forward, some spoiled rich girl who was a bit self-obsessed. I guess how you really would think of as a princess. I even liked her boyfriend better than her, the poor guy stuck around even when he was supposed to be killing her. I\u2019m not sure she deserved his love, but he was loyal to a fault.I loved the Underworld experience in this book the most. I loved the mix of fairy tales and the darkness in this world. I\u2019m hoping if I read another book set in this world, it\u2019ll have a more likable main character to keep me interested in her story. I felt more interested in the world and the other characters than what happened to Viv\u2026 honestly I was rooting for the Stepmother.Verdict:If you like unlikable main characters give this one a go.

I have NOT read Kill Me Softly yet and probably should have before reading this story. Beau Rivage is not your typical town. Cross has created a place where characters straight out of fairy tales like Snow White, Cinderella, and Beauty and the Beast reside and struggle with their curses every day.It is the place where we find 17-year old Vivian \"Viv\" Deneuve who has hair black as night, and lips the color of blood.

It was a fairy tale telling, modernized fairy tale, many tales making a cameo,a princess, prince, childhood friends and fairy curses! But there was one or two things I just really really couldn't stand. I really hated Viv. She was such a hypocrite and really into wallowing in her own self pity. All those years she knew this curse shit was gonna go down one day and she never tried to find her own way out of it. That I can almost forgive if not for the horrid way she treats Henly. I agree with his friends that he should have left her years ago. She makes out with other guys and cheats on him just to test his love for her. Shes that annoying girl that believes her boyfriend's jealousy = omg he loves me! She's a princess alright, a selfish spoiled brat that mistreats her boyfriend/childhood friend. Henley her huntsman boyfriend was almost just as bad with his anger issues. He wrecked this one guy's car just cause his girlfriend Viv started a makeout session with the guy. I mean sure he doesn't hit her but destruction of public/private property is not exactly great either. It definitely shows emotional immaturity on both their parts and my head hurt so bad just trying to read through their unhealthy relationship.I feel angry at the book because of all the lost potential. The fantasy aspects mixed with modern was so cool. It reminded me of Storybrook from the show \"Once Upon a Time\" where all the inhabitants treat magical happenings as something normal and how they deal with it. But the horrible main characters made me quit halfway through with a skim to the end.

Normal people went about their own dysfunctional lives while the Cursed ran the city, and the strangeness went largely unnoticed.\"The premise for the whole world of Tear You Apart did not click for me. You have this town in which \"normal\" people are cursed with fairy tale curses, and everyone must play their part, right? Only, why should they? There are no repercussions to just saying \"fuck it\" and not going through with your curse. In fact, there are no repercussions to just getting the fuck out of dodge. Sayonara, see ya! But everybody just seems to be a glutton for punishment. Why would you stick around if you know you are going to be killed? Why stick around if you know that they cursed you to be the bad guy? I found it hard to believe that Regina would not use her intelligence and just leave her neglectful husband. I understand to a certain extent that the teens must stay because of their parents, but why would the parents (adults mind you, which we see very few of in here, and most of the ones we see are EVIL) WANT their kids to grow in this environment? Makes no sense to me, specially since this story is set in the modern world (the references to pop culture just pained me; it just didn't come natural). You have to apply your disbelief very thoroughly if you are to enjoy the setting. \"Divine... so innocent... gorgeous. more beautiful than she is.\"Not only could I not submerge myself in this world, but the main character was one I could not support. At the beginning it seemed like the best idea ever, a jaded Snow White that has a bit of a back bone to her. \"Viv took the tiny, bitten-off flower in one hand and stroked the mouse's back with the other. \"Thanks,\" she murmured. \"Although if you really loved me, you would have given Regina a disease by now.\"But jaded turned into extremely bitchy and entitled.\"Is there any way I can cut the line?\"\"Normally we only give special treatment to princesses who have eleven sisters. But I guess I could make an exeption...since you remembered not to wear your pajamas.\"\"Thanks,\" she said. \"I'd hate to get you fired.\"REALLY VIV? If before I thought you were a sad example of a heroine now you just made my shit list. She is not the cool Snow White that you would like to hang with, she is the whole entitled princess package. I could not support her in any way, not until the very last chapters. I understand the main character has to have ways in which to develop their character, but at the same time you have to like your main character to some degree if the novel is going to work and not just like them by the very end.The icing on top of the wonderful cake that is Viv is her toxic relationship with Henley.Viv goes out of her way to demean Henley and make him jealous...\"She was only half focused on what Danny was doing. She was thinking about Henley, how angry he would be--as angry as she'd been? Angrier? Her breath caught.\"She holds on to their relationship, and to Henley, even though she knows it is bad for both of them. She keeps Henley on the hook, always thinking that her prince charming is jus down the road so why settle for this guy when another is destined to be with her? Though to be honest Viv thinks her prince is not going to be a prince charming, she thinks he is going to be a psycho who is turned on by dead ladies. She both wants to meet her prince and not, but just in case he turns out to be horrible wrong for her better keep Henley around.\"He couldn't promise he wouldn't kill her. She couldn't promise she would stay with him. They shouldn't be together; she knew that. But she didn't care. Tomorrow she would care, in an hour she might care. But not now.\"The sick feeling rose up in her again. Leaving Henley-- choosing someone else--meant losing him.\"Whatever you want,\" she said. \"I don't own you.\"\"Yes, you do, Viv. You know you do.\"I just want to scream at Henley to grow some balls and leave the crazy girl behind.\"The day Henley turned sixteen, a fairy cursed him to be Snow White's Huntsman. And everything had changed.\"Henley on the other hand you want to like. He got the bad end of the deal. He is on Viv's beck and call, stands her bitchyness and her mood swings, and plays her game of hot/cold. So yeah, you want to feel for Henley, and often times I do feel for the guy, but then he goes and does this...\"Viv followed the sound and her eyes found Henley, lit by the flashing headlights of an orange BMW until he smashes them with a shovel.\"... he pummels the car of a guy that Viv was USING to make Henley jealous. This is the moment where I just wiped my hand off both characters and told them to kill each other. Mind you this is 10% into the story. Eeks.So I had a problem with the characters, the world building (so much info dumping on the first few chapters it was ridiculous), and just the story in general. It felt weird and like the theme was hanging on by a thin thread. I am not even mentioning the \"underworld\" which is only comprised of an underground privileged club and a palace. Really, no world building.Maybe I would have liked this one more if I had started with Kill me Softly (which everyone else seems to really enjoy so I might still give that one a shot).

Viv has the Snow White curse. Her curse is especially cruel because she's in love with the Huntsman who is destined to either cut out her heart or lose her to her prince. I was very excited about this, because it had the potential for an \"if I can't have you, no one can\" twist, since Henley can either kill Viv and keep her heart for always (literally) or spare her and lose her.I definitely liked Tear You Apart more than the first book. There's no insta-love or nonsense love rhombus. Viv and Henley have this intense, on and off again relationship. She's terrified that he'll kill her, but she's also terrified to lose him. On top of that, she's always worrying about her stepmother poisoning her. But then, she's summoned to the Underworld by her prince. Jasper was sick of waiting to meet her, so he took matters into his own hands. The Underworld might also be the only place she's safe from being murdered. At least until she learns about his father's curse.Tear You Apart was pretty great, but it also felt really long in places. The Underworld was interesting the first time, but after that I got kind of bored with it. Jasper wasn't a very interesting character. He's totally under his father's thumb, so he doesn't make his own decisions about anything. There was one moment where he shows a flicker of something, but I couldn't wait for Viv to get away from him. Not just because he's not the one for her despite being the one to break her curse, he was just dull. His father on the other hand, is a total creep! His parts were the most entertaining and at times made me squirm.In the end, I did like Tear You Apart a lot. It was an exciting and twisted take on Snow White and The Twelve Dancing Princesses. Plus one other tale, which might be spoilery so I won't mention it. I was also very happy with the inclusion of two lesbian couples! They're not a huge part of the story, but it was still nice.Read more of my reviews at Pinkindle Reads & Reviews."}, {"userName": "Carissa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4860145-carissa", "userReview": "Title: Tear You ApartAuthor: Sarah CrossSeries: Beau Rivage book 2Chapters: 48Pages: 370Genre: teen fairy tales retoldRating: 4 starsTear You Apart is the sequel or companion novel to Kill Me Softy.

Der Vorg\u00e4ngerband zu diesem Roman hier, gefiel mir damals ausgesprochen gut, war mit seinem Konzept \u00e4hnlich wie die Serie Once Upon A Time (die gab es zum Erscheinen des Buches auch noch nicht) und mal was Neues. TEAR YOU APART war von mir sehnlichst herbei gew\u00fcnscht, weil ich einfach wollte, dass Sarah Cross endlich ein neues Buch schreibt....Pustekuchen!Das Buch beginnt eigentlich gar nicht so schlecht. Viv kennen wir schon aus Band eins, wo sie jedoch nur eine Nebenfigur war, an die ich mich kaum erinnern konnte. Hier ist sie nun die Protagonistin, belastet durch den Schneewittchen Fluch. Die Umsetzung dessen war nett gesagt grausig.Ich war einfach endlos von Viv und ihrem Verhalten genervt. Zum einem gab es ein ganz f\u00fcrchterliches hin und her zwischen ihr und Henley. Der ist so etwas wie ihre Sandkastenliebe und dazu bestimmt Vivs \"J\u00e4ger\" zu sein, sie also zu t\u00f6ten. Er redet st\u00e4ndig davon, mit ihr zu fliehen, ein neues Leben anzufangen und etwas gegen den Fluch zu tun, aber Viv will einfach nicht. Es war echt so, als wollte sie das Opfer sein! Ihre Ausfl\u00fcchte waren dumm und allgemein habe ich null verstanden, wieso sich die beiden nicht gegen ihren Fluch aufb\u00e4umen k\u00f6nnen. Ebenso erging es mir mit Vivs Stiefmutter Regina. Die beiden hatten offenbar ein sau gutes Verh\u00e4ltnis, aber von jetzt auf gleich, will Regina Viv tot sehen.Der Plot ist dann eine Aneinanderreihung von Streits zwischen Viv und Henley, w\u00e4hrend dann ab und zu bekannte Figuren aus Band eins \u00fcber die Bildfl\u00e4che hopsen, nur, damit mal endlich was passiert. Richtig dumm wurde es, als Viv die Unterwelt entdeckt und dort ihren Prinzen trifft, dem sie blind vertraut und f\u00fcr den sie Henley \u00f6fter mal verr\u00e4t.Warum hab ich das Buch aber beendet oder wieso noch 2 Sterne vergeben? Weil trotz all diesen Nerv-Faktoren auch ein paar Sachen dabei waren, die ich mochte. Mira und Blue wiederzusehen zum Beispiel.

Full of magical places, lots of curses, evil characters and good characters and romance. However, these stories might make you see the well-known fairy tale stories with different eyes.Tear You Apart is Viv's stories. She has a cinderella curse, so she's cursed to have a stepmother who hates her and wants to rip her heart, to have a father who does not truly care about her and a lover who's fated to kill her.For those who read Kill Me Softly, you might have read glimpses of this character. But if you haven't, Viv is an unusual character. For me, she was kind of bipolar: one time you were sad about her situation and you wanted to hug her, and the next she would say something or do something that would turn her into a complete witch, not to say something else. That was what made me disconnect a bit from the story and not feel as much for Viv as I felt for Mira in Kill Me Softly. I didn't like how she treated Henley. I understood that the curse sucked and made her life miserable, and that Henley was meant to kill her because of his own curse, bad man, are you serious? Why do you have to hurt the poor guy so much and make him go nuts? That was all I kept saying at the beginning of the story. Although I also have to say that Henley had some \"Are you serious?\" moments in the story.Having bad guys, the ones destined to be the evil boys in the fairy tales stories, is what is characteristic from Sarah Cross' novels. In this story, however, we have two guys: the one who says the curse that will kill her and the one who will save her. Despite this, not everything is that seems to be and I liked that the author kept us readers in the dark until the very last minute to not know who will truly be the prince charming in this story.The plot was amazing. The twists and turns ins this story are amazing, because you really did not see them coming. However, the story starts very slow and it seems that all the good stuff is packed when you have read half the book. We get to see new characters that will make the twists and turns happen! And for those fans of Once Upon a Time these new characters will make them smile and be more invested in the story.I love the Beau Rivage stories and I just hope that Sarah Cross has a new story coming soon, because I am dying to see what comes next!My Dream Cast:"}, {"userName": "Tiffany (About to Read)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2378348-tiffany-about-to-read", "userReview": "I absolutely loved Tear You Apart. It went above and beyond the original novel, Kill Me Softly, and took the traditional Snow White to new heights. If you\u2019ve read Kill Me Softly, you already know that Cross has a negative outlook on the traditional fairytale. And why shouldn\u2019t she? They are full of torment, torture, bad people, and helpless maids (or wicked ones). As much as I do love fairytales, it is quite refreshing to see them in a new light.Our main character, Viv (Snow White), has always hated her curse\u2014especially after her boyfriend was cursed into the role of the huntsman. Has to be hard wondering if the person you\u2019re with will ultimately be the one to cut your heart out. The conflict between those two was so interesting in Kill Me Softly, but it was even better in Tear You Apart. I never really understood why they still had a relationship in Kill Me Softly, so exploring that in Tear You Apart was a treat. These two characters are just incredibly well developed, but slightly irritating at times because Viv needs to take a communication class.Even though the characters in Tear You Apart really shine, it is the plot that gets me so excited. Rather than just a Snow White retelling, Cross incorporated several other exciting fairytales and I just loved it! I\u2019ve said this before, but if you are a Once Upon a Time fan, you need to read this series. Snow White started to feel a lot like Cinderella at certain points, plus we get other stories thrown in for good measure. I\u2019ll leave it to you to figure out which famous characters you\u2019ll be meeting as you read the novel.Sarah Cross really knows how to write a fairytale retelling. She is hands down my favorite in the retellings genre. When you pick up Tear You Apart, you\u2019ll find a great plot and amazing characters, as well as a world you\u2019ll want to return too. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get another full length Beau Rivage novel, but my fingers are crossed for a \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d retelling!For more book reviews, discussions, and book-related fashions, visit abouttoread.com"}, {"userName": "Nyze Gremio", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22211290-nyze-gremio", "userReview": "Honestly, the writing is quite decent. The book is not poorly written, but I can\u2019t still bring myself to actually like it. This is in fact a companion of the book Kill Me Softly, but the story was not so difficult to grasp. I didn\u2019t have difficulties figuring things out though I haven\u2019t read Kill Me Softly. The entire premise is truly intriguing that I\u2019ve finished reading it. However, the book has a lot of eye roll worthy parts and I\u2019ve had some Insert-My-WTF-Face moments. The plot was brimming with unnecessary dramas. I really think that was overkill. So there\u2019s Vivian who\u2019s cursed to have Snow White\u2019s destiny. From the evil stepmother, the talking mirror that\u2019s obsessed with her, Henley the Huntsman and the boyfriend at the same time, Jasper the Prince Charming, the animals that are attracted to her, the stay-lace that would cut her breathing days, the comb/hairpin that would render her in a coma and the poisoned apple chunk that would choke her to death, glass coffin, etc., etc. Okay. Cool. Fairy tale adapted, but the twists they have introduced were rather bothersome.For my full review:Book Review: Tear You Apart by Sarah Cross"}, {"userName": "Stephanie Ward", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4831794-stephanie-ward", "userReview": "'Tear You Apart' is another installment in a young adult fantasy series where the majority of the main characters have been given fairy tale curses - only it takes place in the present time. The mixture of the two - our current society and the various fairy tales we all grew up listening to and reading - gives this book a truly original style and makes it stand out from the other fairy tale retellings that are quite popular lately. In this book, the main focus is on our heroine - Viv - whose mother gave her the Snow White Curse before she was born. She has known the story behind her curse her whole life, including the two possible endings that will come from it. Things aren't so bad with her stepmother, Regina, when she's younger and has her best friend Henley to play with. Feelings grow between the two of them and Viv finds herself falling in love with her best friend - and vice versa - which is awesome. Then, on Henley's sixteenth birthday, a fairy curses him to be a Huntsman - the very one that will be commanded to cut out Snow White's (Viv's, in this case) heart by her stepmother. Viv tries to reassure herself that everything will turn out fine, like the story. Henley won't rip out her heart and some random prince she's never met will come sweep her off her feet to a happily ever after. Neither of these situations is the one that Viv truly wants - she wants her happily ever after to be with Henley, her true love. When a dark prince of the Underworld sets his sights on Viv and promises to spare her from her curse as long as she becomes his princess - Viv is even more confused about what to do. Should she go to the Underworld with the prince, where she doesn't know how things will turn out or if they'll even be okay - or does she stay and let her curse play out, with Henley cutting out her heart or with some unknown prince coming to save her? Viv must decide what she's willing to risk - her life, her heart, her happiness - to be with Henley? Or will she play it safe and take the easy way out, with the consequence being never to see Henley, her father, or her friends again? I've read some of the recent fairy tale retellings that have been published recently and I've enjoyed the majority of them. Most put a small twist or spin on the story to either modernize it or give it a different outcome. This book does both of those things and then some. I loved how the story was focused on Viv and Henley - the equivalent of Snow White and the Huntsman - with the other details included; Viv's stepmother Regina, her father, the magic mirror, and so on. But in the world the author created for this series, we aren't just limited to the characters of one tale. Several others from various fairy tales and stories are present throughout the book and some are even included in the narrative itself, which is something new and fun. I absolutely adored the world the author built for this series! As I mentioned, it's all set in modern/present times - so the characters go to school, drive nice cars, have cellphones and iPods. The way that the author can mesh together the familiar and age-old characters into this modern world is downright amazing. I loved every single detail that we're given - from the descriptions of the other Cursed people in town, to the different places - such as the country club and then the Underworld - and everything in between. It's written so elegantly that I could shut my eyes and transport myself into this world beside Viv. The detailed descriptions along with the vivid imagery makes it an enchanting place - which fits right in with the entire theme. I have to admit that I loved all of the characters in the book - from the main ones to the secondary and even the ones only mentioned in passing. I felt like I got to know them personally, so I could hate Regina for the way she talks to Viv; and I adore Henley for a ton of different reasons. As the description for the book states, fans of the TV series Once Upon a Time will like this book - I have to admit that statement is completely true on my end. It felt like I was inside (on the set?) of the show or that the show was actually based on the world inside the books - it's interchangeable. I'm going to stop fangirling and rambling and just sum it up like this: If you are a fan of the fairy tale retelling boom going on right now, you definitely need to read this book. Even if you're not the biggest fan of retellings or fairy tales, I still highly encourage you to read this one. It's truly unique and will pull you into its world right from the beginning. Basically I think that everyone needs to READ. THIS. BOOK. NOW. You won't regret it - you'll be begging for more. Luckily, I haven't read the other books yet, so I can go back into that magical place without having to wait until the next book is released.Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Bibliojunkies", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5775352-bibliojunkies", "userReview": "Tear You Apart is follow up to Kill Me Softly and is the second in the Beau Rivage series. Ever have it happen where you\u2019re done with a book, thought it was good and don\u2019t think about again until months later? That\u2019s my experience with Kill Me Softly. I thought it was such a creative but frightening spin on those age-old stories, wrote my review and that was it. Months later it popped into my head and I found myself wanting more from this crazy town of Beau Rivage where people live out their fairy tale curses. Some manage to break them. Some find loopholes. Others succumb to them.It took me a few pages to get back into the rhythm of this bizarre town. It seems like any average modern town except here, everyone is looking over their shoulder for the inevitable to happen. Viv has the unenviable Snow White curse and has known this forever. It wasn\u2019t so bad at first especially since her boyfriend Henley, who's also been her best friend since childhood, had sworn to protect her from the huntsman who would eventually come for her. So guess who turned out to be that Huntsman? Yep. Talk about ill-fated. Each page seems like another punch to the gut as you see what Viv has to endure \u2013 fear of being killed and by whom, her wicked stepmother Regina, who\u2019s had it in for her, her own father who\u2019s about as affectionate as a rock.It\u2019s easy to get annoyed with Viv at times because she\u2019s not the sweet, innocent Snow White we know from folklore. No, in this rendering she is paranoid, obstinate and confused. And I had to remind myself that I couldn\u2019t blame her for being that way. Worst yet are her unresolved feelings for Henley. They\u2019re so in love but neither can deny that the curse hangs over them. She\u2019s in constant fear that any day now she\u2019ll die at the hands of the huntsman and fate being as cruel as it has so been far, it\u2019d be at the hands of Henley. It\u2019s a tug of war between these two lovers throughout the story as they fight their feelings and one does what they think is right to protect the other.Viv jumps at a possible solution head first without really thinking it through and you know how that goes. I won\u2019t spoil the rest but she does her best to work out her curse to see if she can find any gaps in it that she can use to her advantage. What I did like to see was her change in attitude \u2013 from being victim to having a say in her own fate. When you analyze fairy tales closely, they\u2019re freaking disturbing. We don\u2019t see that as kids but as we get older, that realization becomes more apparent. Obviously we need to remember the context they were originally written in. Which is why I have to hand it to Sarah Cross for undertaking this task of reimagining folklore and giving it new life, especially when it comes to giving young girls voice and strength in a medium that has historically been undermining of the female gender. She achieved this in Kill Me Softly, and Tear You Apart is perfect for anyone who wants to experience an even more twisted side of these fairy tales and see how these characters rescue themselves. It's very dark and grim with plenty of dysfunctional relationships happening. But getting lost in this world of Beau Rivage and its people is absolutely magical!~ Bel"}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5463965-heidi", "userReview": "Three stars: A book with creative world building, but falters with a weak romance. Viv is tired of waiting for the event that will change her life one way or another. Viv was born with the Snow White curse. As Snow White, she will either have her heart cut out by the Huntsman, who just so happens to be her best friend, Henley, whom she is a love/hate relationship with, or poisoned by her Stepmother Regina. Until she meets her fate, Viv *isn't really living. Will she be doomed to die or will Viv somehow escape the Snow White curse?What I Liked:*I always enjoy a good fairy tale retelling, and Tear You Apart doesn't disappoint as far as the originality of the retelling. I love that Ms. Cross blends Snow White with the Twelve Dancing Princesses as well as Rumpelstiltskin. This book is abounding with creativity and originality. If you want a fun and unique Snow White retelling, you should check this out. *I thoroughly enjoyed the world building. Ms. Cross returns us to Beau Rivage which was first introduced in Kill Me Softly. Beau Rivage is a town inhabited by all the famous players in all the fairy tales. Everyone bears the mark of their particular fairy tale, and each person has either played out their curse, or is waiting for it to happen. Some survive their curses and find happily ever afters, while others don't. Either way, new players for each curse continue to be born. I think the world building is outstanding, and I love encountering all the characters from so many fairy tales. *I liked catching up a bit with characters that I first met in Ms. Cross' companion book, Kill Me Softly. Beau, Mira and Jewel are back, and I liked seeing them again. Jewel continues to be one of the most fascinating characters. She is cursed to always throw up flowers and jewels. I hope she will eventually get her own story. *I was impressed with the evil Stepmother character. I was surprised at her depth and layers. She is conniving and all of that, but she also has a softer side, and I actually felt sympathetic toward her. *I was astounded at the uniqueness of Ms. Cross' Snow White Tale. This one has magic mirrors, a conniving stepmother, a huntsman, who is a best friend, and then it dives down into the underworld. In the underworld, Viv encounters twelve cursed dancing princesses, and a troll with the Rumplestiltskin curse. I liked that Ms. Cross brings the original version of the Snow White story into her version. This was an ingenious little retelling, and I loved how it added in parts from other fairy tales. Very impressed with the creativity. *This is the second in the series but it is a companion novel. You can dive right in without having read the first one. You get a complete story, no loose ends or cliffhangers. And The Not So Much:*Even though I loved the originality of this one, I struggled with the pace. The book tends to go in spurts. I found that there were lengthy sections that continued to to go over and over the same topic. For instance at the beginning, there are repeated scenes showing the turbulence in Regina's and Hensley's relationship. Then during the second half, there are lots of stagnant moments between Vivian and Jasper. There was a lot of repetitiveness that caused the pace to drag in certain sections. *The romance was the other big obstacle for me. This book has a bit of a love triangle, but it never solidifies. Viv is caught between her Huntsman and her Prince Charming. It is apparent, though, from the beginning who has Viv's heart. The problem is that the romance is so turbulent, it lacks any type of feel good emotion. I never connected with the romance, and the second suitor is nothing more than a distraction. *There are some excellent twists and exciting developments toward the end, but when it all played out, I thought the final scene with the troll was a bit too convenient. *I liked that characters from the first book returned, but then I was disappointed that they just faded out in the second half and never had any further appearances. *What happened with Owen the boatsman? It seemed he was going to have an important role, but then he is forgotten. Where were the dwarves?Tear You Apart is an interesting and creative Snow White retelling. I think the world building is outstanding. My issues with this one are a weak romance and slow pacing. Still I would recommend it for fans of original fairy tale retellings. I think the originality of the story and the blending of fairy tales is terrific. I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

When she was born, her deceased mother chose Snow White because she wanted Viv to have a happily ever after with a prince. Of course, the 21st century cannot be mapped precisely on the imaginary world of the Brothers Grimm, and all versions of a tale do not turn out the same way. Further, parents have seldom been successful at devising ideal lives for their children. Living a fairy tale is just as chancy as living any other life: Viv has fallen in love with the boy fated to kill her as he will play the Huntsman in the version of Snow White that she lives. Cross is working out many of the tasks of adolescence in regards to establishing one's life as an adult in terms of relationships and values. Teen readers will recognize themselves and others they know in the main and secondary characters. Viv is a determined character who learns how to balance her own needs with those of others and how to solve problems by thinking things through.

It was a good book. The plot is very interesting and the writing style is great. The world that Sarah Cross has created is outstanding. So, what stops me from falling in love with this book? The toxic relationship of the main couple. Vivian is so nasty to Henley for no good reason, and he's violent tendencies, although he never physically harms Viv, makes him hard to fall in love with. I think Cross tries to explain away their nastiness with their cursed situation that makes them act crazy, but sorry no dice. It was painful. Usually, I can read a book of this size in half a day (sometimes in a few hours) but I had to keep walking away from this one. Reading about the couple, especially in the first half, was brutal. It made me sick. Otherwise the world is very interesting, the plot is very detailed and well-developed, but the main couple is so toxic that it drags my rating of it down. I would be interested in reading Cross' other books in this realm but only if the main characters were not this nauseating to read about.Check out my full review by clicking here."}], "description": "If you want to live happily ever after, first you have to stay alive. \u00a0 Viv knows there's no escaping her fairy-tale curse.
