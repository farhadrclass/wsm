I've read many books about the Holocaust and each time I do, it breaks my heart. This is one story I couldn't put down. It gives insight to the events during that era and the harrowing experiences that many suffered through. I had no idea that there were children that had been kidnapped and raised by the Nazis or entered into breeding programs to create a pure \"Aryan\" race. It sickens me.Although this is a work of fiction, it gives very detailed accounts and the writing is flawless. The author leaves nothing to the imagination. It will probably give me nightmares for weeks to come. This is the kind of book that stays with you."}, {"userName": "Kristie", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13798293-kristie", "userReview": "This was another unique story based during World War II. Henrik and his younger sister, Greta, live in Germany at the beginning of the war. Their father is Jewish and their mother is not. Their father made the decision to become Catholic in order to marry their mother and has practiced Catholicism ever since. Henrik and Greta don't even know that they are Jewish. Of course, according to Hitler none of this matters. When their father becomes ill, Henrik and Greta move with their mother back to Poland where she grew up. This is a completely new life for the children, but it is still dangerous. Henrik looks similar to his father and Greta looks like her mother. She has blonde hair and blue eyes, exactly the type of child that the Nazis want to carry on their race. They take her away and Henrik decides to go get her back. This story starts out when Henrik is young. You get to see how he reacts to his new sister joining the family and how his family interact with each other. You start to care about the characters right away. Then, you watch them grow and how the family changes. You are sad at some of the decisions that need to be made. I enjoyed seeing Henrik grow from a child that whined about sharing his toys and his parents' attention, into a brother that cared about his sister, into a man that made courageous decisions. He was a great character, though flawed, which made him feel more real. There were decisions he made that I wouldn't have agreed with and time spent too long doing other things, other than focusing on his goal, but ultimately he did not give up and became a determined individual. There were several side characters as well, most of which I really enjoyed reading about. However, there was one character that was a bit cliched. I won't discuss him here, so as not to give away spoilers, but he felt less real than the others. He felt to be a bit more of a caricature than a flawed character. This story is told from 3 perspectives, which I did not expect. Most of the story is told from Henrik's perspective and I was a bit surprised when it jumped to a new character's perspective in the second half of the book. There is one additional perspective change towards the end of the book, which was a bit less surprising. I enjoyed all three parts, but Henrik's was my favorite and I think I would have liked the story just as much without the changes. Overall, a great story about the 'pastel orphans' that were taken from their parents to be raised as perfect little Germans meant to be bred to maintain the 'perfect Aryan race'. Though most of the story did not focus on the orphans, it was still an interesting story line and one that I don't recall reading about before. Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with a free electronic copy in exchange for an honest review.  I appreciated the opportunity to read this story. I will add that I also purchased an audio copy of this book and it was well done."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7950608-lori", "userReview": "I read this book on my kindle. Pastel Orphans takes place during the 1930s and 1940s. Most of the book is set in the mid 1940s. Heinrik and his Sister Greta are sent to Poland with their mother for protection. The brother and sister are half Jewish on the father's side. they try to set up a life with the kids mother and aunt. A couple years later the girl Greta is taken by the German's.Greta is blond and has blue eyes. back then kids who look Aryan are taken to eventually be paired up to have children that are \"Pure\" German.Heinrik is almost 17.when he sees the horrible state his mother is in after the kidnapping he sets out to find his kidnapped sister who is ten at the time.  Most of the book is about \"RikI' finding his sister. he meets other teenagers in the forest. becomes friends with Rebekkah a Jewish girl.there are other characters he meets some good some bad.  the book is in three parts. Part One. is seen through Heinrik's eyes. The second in Rebekkah's eyes. and finally a short part is seen through Greta's eyes about 13 years later.

Oh. What more is going to happen as I near the end of the book? Tough details to read. So hard to even think of these tragic injustices towards people with Jewish backgrounds.A lot of flurry at the end. Will think of this book for sometime. Will recall the horrors of the time. Will wonder how those rounded up, up rooted from their homes and families ever managed to endure all that they were subjected to. It's no wonder so many survivors have been so reluctant to speak of these atrocities of war. At the same time, first person accounts manage to ensure that the world truly listens.

It follows the life of Henrick, growing up in Germany, the son of a Jewish father and Christian mother. The majority of the book is written from Henrick's point of view, but there are two other sections narrated by Rebecca and Henrick's sister Greta.

Also interesting in featuring a character who has grown up ill - Beka is the first chronic kid I can think of in WWII fiction, particularly as a European.Otherwise, the characters feel cardboardy - how does Riki just learn everything? - aside from a few exceptions. The writing style works until it doesn't, when the narrator turns about sixteen and again when the narrating character changes altogether; all three perspective characters have the same flat, pale tone.It's a WWII novel set in occupied Poland; of course it's emotionally weighty; of course it's horrifying; of course the characters aren't going to be bright chatterboxes with snappy dialogue. Still and all, though, I'm not mad that I spent a few hours reading this, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you've got the same historical fixation I do."}, {"userName": "Barb Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23048972-barb-anderson", "userReview": "Great!Loved this book!!

Henrik is a likable character and makes a great protagonist, but the author switches povs, and Rebakah, Henrik's new-found friend and travel companion and soon-to-be first love, becomes the narrator, and her character is a lot less likable. She's sick and weak and pretty much has to be carried, which makes no sense and doesn't match the initial pace set for the story, which seemed to be about children who grow into their surroundings and learn lessons and become stronger for it. She's a typical weak female character who has no personal growth throughout the story. The switch ruined the story for me. I wanted to stay in Henrik's mind while he searched for Greta; his sister, who has been kidnapped by the nazis to become part of Hitler's \"superior\" dream-race of blue-eyed, blonde Aryans. On Henrik's quest to find Greta, he becomes ill and is saved by Rebekah and her brother. Rebekah is cold and standoffish at first, but soon falls for Henrik and leaves her brother and the small army of resistance fighters hiding out in the middle of the forest. At this point, Henrik changes. He becomes a lot less likable, and Rebekah becomes unbearable. She's been sick and weak her whole life, but decides to join a boy who's going to have to trek through the wilderness to find his sister. I found this to be annoying and unbelievable. After the story changes to Rebekah's pov, Henrik starts making stupid decisions and puts both of their lives in needless danger constantly by being headstrong and impatient, and Rebekah does the same by being weak and blabbering, but that's not the annoying part; the annoying part is that he always gets out of it in some unbelievable way, and after about the 3rd time, the danger starts to feel unreal. The nazis are always too slow or too dumb. Rebekah and Henrik are conveniently strong when the nazis are weak, and weak when the weather is strong, and they're never strong, but always stronger than characters who are strong but become conveniently weak and their friends save them, and their enemies save them, and it all becomes so unbelievable as to be just plain... well... unbelievable. It's never fun to read a story in which you KNOW the character is going to come out unscathed. You root for your hero, but their possible imminent demise is what keeps you hooked... or what keeps me hooked. Though, this could just be me. I may just be sick-minded.I won't go on about the story. I don't like writing negative reviews, but seeing the high rating for this book is what made me want to read it, and I feel a little cheated, so if you're reading this (which I doubt anyone is,) be warned: this book may disappoint. I loved Liviero's other WWII historical fiction novel, Broken Angels; it is absolutely amazing. Maybe I'm only disappointed because I thought this one would be on the same level. This is only MY opinion, and I respect all author's and their work. I don't advise anyone to take my word for it. I'm writing this more for myself than anyone else. I personally do not like coming-of-age novels, so if you do, ignore this entire review, and read this book! If you don't, well, read it anyway. You might like it, because my opinion is just a very small drop in a large bucket of positive reviews."}, {"userName": "Deborah Widup", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31860310-deborah-widup", "userReview": "A MasterpieceUsually I don't like to read books about the Holocaust, books about war.

He plays with his newborn sister, Greta. However, their living conditions gradually deteriorate. Emmett loses his job and becomes sick and bedridden. There is less food on their table, and their housemaid is released. Henrik is confused by these changes as well as other incidents, which he questions incessantly. By 1939, Karolin, distressed, flees using forged papers, taking Henrik and Greta to her sister\u2019s farm in Poland and leaving Emmett behind. Germany invades Poland, and little blonde-and-blue-eyed Greta is taken away by the Nazis. When Karolin tries to interfere, an officer whips her, and she falls unconscious.

Pastel Orphans offers an interesting perspective of some of the major events that went down.  Gemma Liviero creates a tense, fast paced read that is appropriately framed in the eyes of two children on the verge of growing up. She focuses on their individualized stories, and in use of the classic underdog trope, makes readers root for a happy ending. In spite of the likelihood of all the children making it out of the novel alive, I still hoped for a future for Henrik, Greta, Rebekah, & Kaleb. And I believe that Liviero delivers this the best she can while still maintaining the realism of the harsh conditions in Poland during WW2. This concept of the Pastel Orphans was one I was somewhat familiar with, but had little exposure prior to reading this. It's a different focal point during this time, and for that, I really enjoyed reading more about it. The idea that a group of teenagers are on their own in this great, big world, during one of the most dangerous time periods for Jews, and sympathizers heightens the novels suspense. Not only that, but the idea that two children born from parents of different heritage can almost be pitted against one another due to their likeness is another interesting concept Liviero explores. The only criticism I have is that the ending felt rushed. I appreciated the plot twist at the end, but Liviero summarized some events that the whole novel was leading up to. All in all though, a good read and very deserving of a recommendation & 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Annemarie Macken", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15410287-annemarie-macken", "userReview": "'Pastel Orphans' is a truly magnificent, thought-provoking and heart-wrenching novel. The simplistic style in which the stories of the main characters is relayed serves to captivate and horrify the reader in equal measure. It is this simplicity which has the greatest effect - delivering unexpected and graphically explicit horror about atrocities that are still beyond belief for the common man. The style is particularly effective in its delivery of such monumental savagery and inhumanity at its most depraved in such blunt, straightforward and, almost, childlike innocence.The characters are captivating and the reader bonds unquestionably with them from the first page to the last, urgently willing them to escape every dangerous and life-threatening situation in which they inevitably find themselves. The fact that these situations reflect very real experiences only makes the tension and atmosphere ever more urgent and pressing. To think that people had to go through these things just makes it more and more effective as each page is turned. The gripping storyline will have you turning each page looking for good news, looking for something good to come out of all the misery... and ultimately finding that there is just another terrible bend in the road as each corner is reached. Despite this, it has illuminating moments of hope, courage, bravery beyond reason and beauty. True beauty and love which shines through the selfless and heroic actions of some people faced with the devastating plight of others. I promise you a novel that you will not want to put down and, when it ends, you will feel like you have been on such an immense journey, the lessons from which will stay with you well after you put the book down.Kudos to the writer for such effectively chosen words. This is one of the most gripping books I have read in a long time - everyone should read this book and you will not be disappointed: devastated, enlightened, inspired, and feelings like your emotions have been on the world's fastest rollercoaster, but never disappointed.Kudos to the author for such effectively chosen words."}, {"userName": "Sue Seligman", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/821912-sue-seligman", "userReview": "This is an usual Holocaust novel which is primarily told in the voice of a young German boy named Henrik, who lives with his parents and little sister in Berlin during the 1930s.
