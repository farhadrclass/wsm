The influence of Tristan Tzara's Dada, to which Breton was briefly affiliated, has been widely acknowledged. Initially considered a literary movement, Surrealism has since become more commonly associated with painting (specifically the paintings of Salvador Dali, who caused a stir when he claimed: \"I am Surrealism\"). Likewise, Surrealism is commonly associated with the French. Though few English-language poets are exclusively surrealist, this selection demonstrates the range of Surrealism's literary impact. From David Gascoyne, one of the earliest and most dedicated British advocates of surrealists, and Kenneth Patchen, the closest American counterpart with regards to his political and transcendental concerns, to numerous other poets who directly incorporated or were indirectly influenced by Surrealism, including: A.J.M. Smith, Ruthven Todd, Charles Madge, Djuna Barnes, Dylan Thomas, Charles Henri Ford, Thomas Merton, Weldon Kees, Frank O'Hara, Robert Duncan, Kenneth Koch, John Ashbery, H.R. Hays, Robert Bly, George Hitchcock, Donald Hall, Bill Knott, Ted Berrigan, Ron Padgett, Tom Clark, James Tate, Mark Strand, Robin Magowan, John Haines, Andrei Codrescu, W.S. Merwin, and Michael McClure (among others)...A.J.M. Smith...Nobody said Apples for nearly a minute -I thought I should die.Finally, though, the second sardinefrom the end, on the left,converted a try.(It brought down the house.The noise was terrific.I dropped my glass eye.)Meanwhile Mr Baldwinmanaged to make himself heard.He looks sadbut with characteristic aplomb saidkeep calm there is no cause for alarm.Two soldiers' crutches had sexual intercourseon the spot with a little bit of flufffrom a lint bandage in the firing chamberof a 12 inch gun.People agreed not to notice.The band played a little bit louder.It was all very British.- Political Intelligence, pg. 89David Gascoyne...Yes you have said enough for the time beingThere will be plenty of lace later onPlenty of electric woolAnd you will forget the eglantineGrowing around the edge of the green lakeAnd if you forget the colour of my handsYou will remember the wheels of the chairIn which the wax figure resembling you satSeveral men are standing on the pierUnloading the seaThe device on the trolly says MOTHER'S MEATWhich means Until the end.- The End is Near the Beginning, pg. 109Charles Madge...The character of a landscape stand always in a mysterious relation to the soul of man.And while he thought thus and lay on skins on the ground, the jaguars swam through the stream, and played round his resting-place.The instruments had to share the couch of the travellers at night.And gave science an insight into the analogy of natural formations, and the ruling laws of the globe in reference to its veins of water.- Landscape I, pg. 138Kenneth Patchen...A beast stands at my eye.I cook my senses in a dark fire.The old wombs rot and the new motherApproaches with the footsteps of a world.Who are the people of this unscaled heaven?What beckons?Whose blood hallows this grim land?What slithers along the watershed of my human sleep?The other side of knowing...Caress of unwaking delight...O startA sufficient love!

If you\u2019ve ever read Benjamin Peret, the Belgian surrealist, the surrealist of all surrealists, you\u2019d see where some of these imitations came from. It doesn\u2019t work. Oddly enough, the book also contains many translations of surrealist poetry into English, and how that qualifies as English surrealism you got me. Still, things improved as the book went on, though I find it hard to classify a lot of the work in here as strictly surrealist, and who cares. Among the contemporary poets included are W.S. Merwin, John Ashbery, Frank O\u2019Hara, Kenneth Patchen and James Tate. Yes, the volume is overwhelmed by men and I guess there are few female surrealists, or even non-surrealists who have written a surrealist poem that anyone has read. But enough quibbling. I enjoyed this a lot, even some of the crappy parts were so crappy they made me laugh. And there was also some excellent stuff in there, like the short short poems of Bill Knott, and Ken Smith\u2019s poem \u201cTrain.\u201d (here: http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/train-2/)Death by Bill KnottGoing to sleep, I cross my hands on my chest.They will place my hands like this.It will look as if I am flying into myself."}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/328052-tracy", "userReview": "I bought this book in Toronto, Canada when I was 16 or 17. It's truly fascinating. I had never read poetry like it before, never even knew poetry could be surrealist, and found many of the poems brought me inspiration for my own work.

In England, the movement arose as the logical evolution of 19th century literature's dominant concern - the psychopathology of the artist's mind. Being unconcerned with conventional morality, it had few affinities with the humanist tradition of literature and saw the classical tradition as antithetical to literature altogether.
