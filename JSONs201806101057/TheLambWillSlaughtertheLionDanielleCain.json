I am blown away. Within 100 pages, this book was able to create a beautifully diverse cast, talk about some pretty important issues, showcases a homeless main character, show the beauty of unconditional-loving found families, and it even gave me some pretty gothic spooky animals. This was amazing, and I think truly believe so many of my book friends would love it.The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion follows Danielle Cain entering a new town of squatters, who have turned this little town in Iowa into something so damn special. In Freedom, Iowa these people have come together and created a community that truly believes in helping everyone and making sure everyone is treated equally and equally giving and taking from the community. Danielle is twenty-eight and has been moving from place to place for the last ten years. But Danielle sought-after this town specifically, because it was the last place her best friend lived before committing suicide. \n\n\u201cNo cops, no bosses, no landlords. No poverty. No laws. Hard work and community and freedom and all the shit that we ought to have.\u201d\n\nAnd right off the bat, when Danielle meets Vulture, he asks her which pronouns she prefers, and then tells Danielle which pronouns he uses. It was so easy, but so important, and I wish we lived in a world where this was the standard when meeting someone. And it started the book off in such a great way for me. Yet, on the first day Danielle comes to town, a man dies, pretty brutally, from a monster deer demon, named Uliksi, that was summoned to kill anyone in the town that tries to gain power over anyone. Yeah, you read that sentence right. And this tale quickly turns into a mystery of if Uliksi has turned against the town, or if this mystical deer is still only after those who have committed evil acts. \n\n\u201cUliksi hunts the vengeful, the hateful. As Clay put it, Uliksi hunts those who wield power over others.\u201d\n\nThese 100 pages hold such a magical story, but like I said above, they also hold such important themes and discussions. This book talks about the importance of pronouns. This book has an almost full queer cast, with a lot of racial diversity, too. Then, there are discussions to be had about how we live in the most powerful country in the world, but we give some citizens nothing, and others everything. And at the heart of this novella, it is a book about power imbalances, and how people misuse that power for the good of only themselves. Different power dynamics are always at the forefront of this book. Danielle has a panic attack in this book, and it is written exactly how mine feel. This was probably the most accurate description to my personal feelings when having (and starting) one, that I\u2019ve ever read. Also, this book starts by Danielle wanting to go to the last lived in town of her best friend who killed themselves. And there is absolutely no suicide shaming in this book. There is a part where someone asks Danielle if she is upset and she says something like, \u201conly at the world\u201d and I was weeping. Perfection. \n\n\u201cWe do good things too, but you don\u2019t get props for not hurting people.\u201d\n\nTrigger/Content Warnings: mention of suicide, mention of rape, animal death, death of a friend/loved one, abuse, violence, and gore. Also, just in case I did a sub-par job at explaining it: this is a horror novel, so it\u2019s a tad bit on the spooky side, so use caution. \n\n\u201cFor the past year, we\u2019ve had this benevolent, murderous spirit watching over us. Which is weird, but it\u2019s gone fine.\u201d\n\nThis is such a unique story too, because even though it is set in modern day times, with Instagram, the internet, and iPhones, it still feels and reads dystopian. But I loved this, I loved the aesthetic, I loved every emotion this short book was able to evoke from me. This was nothing short of a treat to read. Also, give me all the books about summoning demons, especially monster deer. Thanks. Danielle finds herself trusting strangers and entering this beautiful found family who truly cares about the members, even though society has turned their backs on them. From witch\u2019s huts, to towns built on trust, to undead animals, to secret notes left in books, I fell in love with this story. And I loved Danielle, but these side characters? Vulture, Thursday, Doomsday, and Brynn have all carved out a special place in my heart and I can\u2019t wait to read more about them and their adventures in The Barrow Will Send What it May! Also, nothing warmed my heart more than Vulture and his Instagram! But please stop sleeping on this book and give this important and wonderful little book a try! I promise, you won\u2019t regret it. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only a small handful of things in this world that make me happy, and coffee is one of them.\u201d\n\nBlog | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram | Youtube | Twitch"}, {"userName": "destiny \u2620 howling libraries", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15335689-destiny-howling-libraries", "userReview": "#1 The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605#2 The Barrow Will Send What it May \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\u201dIt\u2019s strange how quickly it\u2019s normal, there being magic in the world. It\u2019s strange how little it changes about who we are as people.\u201d\nAs a long-time horror fan, the biggest complaint I have had about the genre is how exclusive and problematic it can be. For a long time, it\u2019s been really rare that you would find a horror book (or novella) that didn\u2019t feature only white, straight characters\u2014much less that you would find a story going out of its way to include a vast array of diverse characters and political commentary. When I heard that this series was a queer horror/fantasy storyline? I had to have it, and I was not disappointed in the slightest.\n\u201dClay, he was traveling to try to find home, I was traveling because traveling was home. He wanted something like this, I was afraid of something like this. Someplace that would lure me away from the road. I\u2019m more afraid of growing roots than I\u2019m afraid of anything.\u201d\nDanielle\u2019s story works perfectly as a novella, because it drops you right into the action. As soon as she reaches Freedom, Iowa, she\u2019s immediately caught up in a whirlwind of terror, magic, uncertainty, and death. Even though there\u2019s a lot going on, Margaret Killjoy still manages to pack a tremendous amount of backstory and character development into these 112 pages. Danielle is a fantastic anarchistic punk character, complete with a complete disregard for the system, a striking sense of self-awareness, and absolute horror at the thought of ever settling down.\nSimple as that, we walked out the door. No money, no accounting, no ration cards, nothing. Trust alone. I\u2019d found a town that worked on trust alone.\nNot only do we get to learn so much about these fantastic characters, but Freedom itself is seriously a complete utopia. Everyone is so accepting and caring of one another, and it honestly made my heart ache to think that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever see a world as open-minded and kind as Freedom, Iowa. There are people of all sexualities and gender identities, all races and ages, slim and thick, short and tall. There are queer people everywhere, and it\u2019s so normalized that nobody feels forced to put a label on their own sexuality or explain who they are or why. One of the very first pieces of dialogue in the story is a character introducing themselves and immediately following it up with, \u201cWhat are your pronouns?\u201d It was so beautiful and varied and I loved every moment of it.\n\u201dSo yeah, welcome to Freedom, Iowa. For the past year, we\u2019ve had this benevolent, murderous spirit watching over us. Which is weird, but it\u2019s gone fine.\u201d\nOf course, at its core, this is still a horror novella, and it does have some creepy settings and moments that ticked all of my aesthetical checkboxes. There\u2019s a creepy, blood-red, three-antlered deer/demon named Uliksi, who runs with a horde of undead animals of varying species, each with open, empty ribcages. He literally kills people who usurp power over others or bring harm to others, and it helps to keep the town safe from would-be thieves, rapists, murderers, and more, as everyone is stricken by the fear of Uliksi\u2019s judgment falling upon them. It sounds harsh, but as Danielle muses at one point, it gets the job done, and its benefits vastly outweigh its costs.\nI wish he\u2019d listened to his own advice, though. I wish he\u2019d kept going. I wish he\u2019d found his way through.\nFinally, the last thing that I adored about this book was its stance on suicide. We learn quickly that Danielle\u2019s mission is inspired by a hope of learning why her best friend killed himself, but there is never a single moment of suicide-shaming or mental health-related ableism. When another characters asks Danielle if she\u2019s angry, her unhesitant response is that she\u2019s not angry at her friend, just the world that brought him to that desperate state. While the story does not glorify the act of suicide at all, I think it\u2019s so crucial that it offers this kind take on it: while it\u2019s devastating for those left behind, it\u2019s not an act performed out of malice or cowardice. It\u2019s an act of desperation.\nBecause he\u2019d decided Freedom was home, and he couldn\u2019t come back. That\u2019s what having a home will do to you. Maybe.\nI genuinely cannot explain to you guys, as a queer horror fan, how much this novella\u2019s existence and this author\u2019s work means to me. It was so wonderful to finally see myself represented in a horror story that never vilified me and people like me, or any other marginalized groups. On top of that, the writing itself is just so enjoyable and fluid, the characters are lovable (especially Danielle\u2019s found family, who offer fantastic banter and I hope to spend much more time with in future installments), and like I said, it\u2019s so delightfully macabre in its aesthetic. I am so happy that I took the time to pick up this novella, and I cannot wait to read the sequel!Buddy read with Melanie! \u2661"}, {"userName": "Matthew Quann", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann", "userReview": "One of my favourite things about reading is when I am able to inhabit a perspectives entirely different from my own. Reading is a great way to build empathy because it asks of the reader to abandon their own viewpoints in favour of another. When we engage with those different viewpoints, we are forced to try and understand them, and through that act come to appreciate another's existence. What's really special is when an author is able to provide such a unique viewpoint and voice that it makes even the old feel new.Of course, there's not much old going on in Margaret Killjoy's The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion. I read this superbly paced novella in a single sitting and was astounded at how much Killjoy is able to pack into this slim package. There's a diverse and interesting group of anarchists living in the rural US that our lead, Danielle, meets as she strolls into town on her nomadic journey. It turns out Danielle's recently deceased friend was involved in the summoning of a murderous, three-horned, deer spirit that polices the town.UH OH!Where there's possibility for Killjoy to fall into tropes or cliches, they are cleverly avoided by political debates, romance, backstory, and a superbly fun voice. Though I didn't expect it from a horror novel, Danielle is a unique and often hilarious voice throughout the proceedings. The horror is more subdued from what I had expected based on the synopsis and other reviews. Indeed, horror has equal stage time as fantasy, politics, and mystery.I loved the world and atmosphere that Killjoy crafts in The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion. There's a wide display of gender, sexuality, lifestyle, and opinions that makes every bit of dialogue seem hyper-realistic. Alan Moore had good things to say about this one, though I was reminded more of Gaiman's Sandman and its ever changing, diverse cast. Enjoyment of either author is reason enough to try out Killjoy. I decided to read this one when I found myself briefly stranded with naught to read by my kindle. I figured a horror novella would fit in nicely with my pseudo-goal of reading more horror this month. It didn't exactly provide what I expected, but this is one in which I'm happily surprised. The ending seems to suggest there will be more in this vein, or at least more featuring Danielle. I'll be keeping my eye out for whatever Killjoy puts out next![4.5 Stars]"}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 4* of five...the fuck did I just read...?#ReadingIsResistance to run-of-the-mill fantasy reads.

It's a lovely and unusual read: a queer traveller comes to an off grid type settlement of anarchists and dropouts which has been set up as a utopia to discover why her friend left it and killed himself. Part of the reason might be the giant murderous demon stag he helped summon. Oops.This is on one level a tense horror novel, where forces of the State and society and male violence are as much a sinister and pervasive threat as the heart-eating magic deer. But, as that suggests, it's also a meditation on things like society, what anarchism means, how societies enforce rules and what it means to do so and who takes enforcement roles on themselves. How do we keep ourselves decent without a prospect of punishment for those who transgress? Who makes those calls? Danielle has a terrific snarky narrative voice, without the smugness that often brings--she uses dark humour to hold herself together after a rough, rough life. I loved her and her band of new friends (it's an effortlessly diverse story with queer and trans and POC characters at front and centre) and I'm very excited this is the first in a series.

Edit 10/05/17 : Just found out this is going to be a series and I'm HAPPY!! *currently working on my review but this is an August release so I won't post it this month ><*_______________________Review originally posted on my blog!I started reading this novella without having read the description first (as I often do\u2026), mostly because it was super short and I was thinking \u201cWell, it\u2019s from Tor Publishing, this can only be good\u201d so you know\u2026Now I have read the description and what else can I say? Because frankly if the description alone doesn\u2019t make you want to read this I don\u2019t know what else I can do or say. I\u2019ll try anyway because it was too good and I\u2019d feel bad if someone was to miss on this super cool novella.The main character is a middle aged woman and I LOVED that! She has lived and known pain, and has some very deep and very funny thoughts. She lives her life and we find her here in search of answers regarding a close friend who commited suicide (TW for this, if you hadn\u2019t seen on the description of the novella.)There is an instance where she has a panic attack and the way it was written was amazing. It was anxiety-inducing but at the same time so well written, so real, that I had to read the passage several times.Denise is also a fighter, she is used to live on the road and loves that, but she also is aware of the dangers it entails. The events of this novella will show how she is more than ready to act when there is need to.\u201cI didn\u2019t open my juice because that took both hands, and I don\u2019t follow strange men into the darkness without at least one hand free for fighting.\u201dRight from the beginning, the first person Denise encounters asks her what pronoun she uses before making assumptions and I loved that. I love how books and social-media are teaching us how to be more inclusive and that this is a totally normal thing to say to someone.\u201cCould have been a squirrel, or a bird. Hell, could have been a mountain lion. Better a living mountain lion than an undead squirrel.\u201dThis book is full of awesome elements. There are zombies animals eating people who are bad, a demon deer gone rogue, creepy vibes, a diverse cast of characters, a deep sense of community, a lovely and real w/w relationship with no strings attached, questions about doing the right things\u2026 There is a bit of a Supernatural vibe to it, if Supernatural was not so problematic \ud83d\ude09This novella also made me think a lot, it has ways of thinking not often found in literature or SFF, or at least I hadn\u2019t encountered them yet. Just to give you an idea of what\u2019s going on, here is the author\u2019s bio from goodreads :\"Margaret Killjoy is an itinerant author, editor, and photographer whose interests include forest defense, anarchism, and the serial comma.\"The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion felt like an origin story. When I finished reading this novella, I felt READY to read some more with those characters and the premise of all of this. I was ready to be all \u201cuhhhh I wish this was a series!!!\u201d all over twitter, but then I found the cover reveal where it is said that it is \u201cThe first in a new series\u201d so : I\u2019m happy!A review copy (e-galley) of this book was provided by the publisher. Some things might change in the final copy."}, {"userName": "Kaleigh Robbins", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16770925-kaleigh-robbins", "userReview": "[ Punk drifter Danielle Cain is heading to the squatter town of Freedom, Iowa looking for answers to her friend Clay\u2019s sudden, unexplained suicide. She quickly bumps into some of the residents of the town, who happen to be punk like her, and they all make a heavy-handed show for the reader of just how counter-culture they are and how cool and ideal that is. When introducing herself to the first person she meets, Danielle notes that her last name \u201cwasn\u2019t my legal name, but it was my punk name.\u201d Then shortly after she notes that her new friends are incredibly friendly and welcoming, like all punks and squatters of course. She notes that they are on the couch, \u201clounging atop one another in the same way that punks and puppies do.\u201d The statements here and throughout the book smell of the type of shirts that you can buy in teenager-aimed stores like Hot Topic that loudly proclaim \u201cPUNK\u201d across the front in a glaring font to remind their high school peers that they are the real thing. That is, it seems incredibly performative for observers and less meaningful for the people actually practicing it. To be fair, I am unfamiliar with punk culture, so I have no standard to gauge this representation against. But with how often the book insists on reminding the reader that the characters are punk and that punk is the way to be, it would make me think that punks are on a level with overzealous vegans in their insistence on convincing others of the virtue of their lifestyle.\tThe ideology of the book in general is oversimplified and preachy, when it truly could have been made into so much more. Animal Farm, a much better executed novella that the book references, dealt with the issue of authority by showing that power corrupts when left unchecked. Every aspect of Animal Farm works to explore that one central idea. The Lamb says that all power is inherently evil, but it doesn\u2019t do anything to explore the deeper meaning of that statement. It wastes a good deal of its time expunging on the glory of punk anarchist culture, introducing a zany cast of characters, and bringing up small issues that immediately get resolved. A gay relationship is introduced that immediately falls apart and gets brushed under the rug. A hint of distrust and ulterior motives exists between the main characters that simply gets ignored and goes away over time. Uliksi holds the main character and her love interest hostage in a tree, then he leaves a few hours later and they can go, no problem. Amazingly, there\u2019s a mini-conflict brought up and then destroyed within the space of a page, when some characters seriously contemplate keeping the spirit, then immediately get shot down by the wisdom of the main character, \u201cI\u2019ve been through way too much shit for you to switch sides on me now.\u201d They drop the subject and never bring it up again. None of this is building up to commentary on anything, or at least, not any commentary intended by the author.The central conflict seems to be this: who has the right to regulate morals in an anarchist society? Apparently no one, since the characters who decided to stand up against the tyrant in their community are punished by the spirit for wielding power over another person. Killjoy seems to say, \u201cLook, I\u2019m showing that judging tyrants is in itself evil, because judgement is wielding power over another person, and wielding power over people is bad.\u201d\tDespite how nonsensical it is to say that judgement is an act of evil that must be punished, (wouldn\u2019t the spirit have to kill itself? For that matter, wouldn\u2019t the characters we\u2019re supposed to like be just as bad as the ones they\u2019re fighting?) the author simply drops the subject at that point. The book is spent mostly moving about, wasting pages in various little tangents. The dialogue between the characters delves randomly into exposition and is often bafflingly wooden, \u201c\u2019Clay was my best friend,\u2019 I said. \u2018About a month ago, he slit his own throat.\u2019 \u2018Fuck,\u2019 Brynn said. \u2018That\u2019s hardcore.\u2019\u201d The rest of the time is spent exhibiting how total anarchism plays out without going into any hard-hitting details of their lifestyle. It all just works, and we\u2019re expected to accept that. It is admittedly nice to see a large cast of queer characters filling roles straight characters get to do, but they get so little development that they, like the story, are underwhelming. Because we only get their identities\u2014gay, queer, trans\u2014and don\u2019t see their characters fleshed out much beyond that, the representation falls flat. It\u2019s also never explained exactly what the situation with United States is at the time; the beginning implication is that the economy has collapsed and a large portion of the country has become unlivable due to environmental hazards. But then one of the characters has an Instagram that he updates compulsively, and another buys a water key off the internet. They are mentioned to be getting food from a food bank, and Danielle drives easily to another state for a funeral, which all requires infrastructure, trade, tech maintenance, and highly developed government. This is all hand-waved as well. One could argue that the entire book is hand-waved.The resolution of the book is a cluster of missteps. The conflict culminates with Danielle explaining to her new friends and the audience in the most soap-box moment she has that the spirit \u201cwas hunting his summoners because his summoners were predators.\u201d Her friend who committed suicide was one of the summoners, so he \u201che killed himself, because he knew Uliksi was right to be after him\u201d (emphasis hers). I\u2019m still having trouble wrapping my head around this logic, especially since this cure-all solution is presented by her in one paragraph, with only bare-bones support from the previous 100 pages to back it up. In another bizarre reveal, one character admits that she was abused by her husband, so she killed him in relatively cold blood and then killed a few police officers in her escape. Danielle\u2019s only response to this? \u201cDamn.\u201d This implies again that the main characters can do whatever they want, because they are the main characters and consistency with the moral code is inconvenient. Also it ends up that the spirit was leaving anyway because it didn\u2019t feel like being there anymore, so banishing it was a non-issue the whole time. And for the epilogue, the gang decides to go and have a fun time hunting down more spirits without ever questioning the deeper morals of what they\u2019re doing.\tThe story is inept in the way it handles its moral quandary, writing, dialogue, and plot, but it does have a few bright spots. Killjoy skillfully implies that the main character is trans, though never coming out and saying it, which is a surprising amount of restraint from a book that can\u2019t seem to deal with anything else thoughtfully. They also somewhat convincingly show a community that has integrated acceptance into its very nature. \u201cWhat pronouns do you prefer?\u201d is dropped on page 18 during Danielle\u2019s first meeting with the townsfolk, and no big deal is made of it. Danielle, a bisexual, begins an explicitly romantic relationship with another girl, Brynn, but they abstain from sex at Brynn\u2019s request. This is treated as perfectly acceptable. It is nice to see both bisexual and celibate (perhaps asexual?) representation played out so front-and-center. Killjoy does have a certain way with words, especially when it comes to the descriptions of the horrific visage of the bloody demon deer and its undead host. Out of everything that the novel does, the images of the supernatural it evokes are what lasts after the reader turns the last page.\tOverall, I would not recommend this novella to those looking for a thoughtful or inspiring read. Those who care less about quality and more about pulp entertainment might gain more from it than I did, but I am afraid that they too would find it ultimately disappointing in the final hand-wave of its action. I do wish to see what Killjoy produces in the future, since they did, after all, show a good deal of creativity in conceiving this project, and talent in the short bits of prose describing the dreaded monster stag. The world always needs more queer fantasy, though preferably good queer fantasy. Perhaps as their writing matures so will their interest in thoughtfully developing their work, and creating something more substantial out of it.

This leads her to Freedom, Iowa, a small almost-utopian town in which anarchy apparently works. If we ignore the murderous three-antlered deer who loves to disembowel those who try to seize power, of course.I thought this was a solid beginning for a series, but nothing more - and I wanted more from this premise. I've never read anything similar, and you'd think that a book about a deer-like demon and its ribcage-less cronies made from dead animals would be something more than \"almost forgettable\", but if it hadn't been for the ending, I doubt I would have anything to say about it at all. The setup and the creepy atmosphere were interesting, but there's not much to the characters.Don't get me wrong, The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion was fine, it wasn't bad, I just wanted something more than fine.I have to say that with the ending I started to really enjoy the character's dynamics, and these may be more developed in the sequel (which I will consider reading). What this book said about anarchy and choices - will you become a monster to make sure your utopian future doesn't have a place for monsters? - was really interesting to read as well.Another thing I really liked about this was the diversity: there's trans rep and there are also hints of a f/f romance - I didn't care that much about the character themselves, as I don't feel like I know them at all yet, but I liked that pairing."}, {"userName": "Wealhtheow", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76129-wealhtheow", "userReview": "Danielle Cain hitchhikes to Freedom, Iowa to discover what it was there that led her best friend Clay to kill himself. As soon as she arrives she sees an undead bloodred stag feeding on a rabbit. So clearly, something weird is up. She rapidly falls in with some of Clay's old friends, and they spill the story: Clay and a few others summoned a spirit to get rid of a power-hungry guy, and now the spirit pretty much rules their town. The townfolk (and for that matter, Danielle) are split about this: on the one hand, super cool to have proof that magic exists! Great to have an impartial omniscient arbiter of who has preyed on others! On the other hand, the spirit has killed several townsfolk already. The town fights over whether to dismiss the spirit, and it all ends bloodily.I got a good sense of Danielle's personality, but not her life. I don't know if that's just because she's so itinerant that the little things I did pick up on--her taste in music, her methods of defending herself, her tactics for staying fed--are her life, or what, but it left me feeling like she was more of a cipher than I wanted. Since this is a novella, there isn't much characterization for the various townsfolk. The town as a whole gets a nice bit of description, like what the food store is like or how they make decisions and share information.

Danielle Cain, a wanderer at heart (ha), arrives at the communal town that her friend had been so happy in\u2014until he killed himself a few weeks earlier. She\u2019s seeking answers, but she\u2019ll find many more questions there than she\u2019d like: starting with the blood-red, three-antlered, carnivorous deer she sees on her first day in town. Killjoy paints a creepy world. It was enjoyable, inventive, and creepy, and proves once again how excellent the novella series being putting out by Tor.com is, and how innovative its support of the fantasy and sci fi novella. The mythic, occult world of the novel is visual, and the relatively diverse cast of characters is well thought-out, a community of people who wanted to forge a new kind of life and are now faced with a big problem that will raise questions of justice, righteousness, and what it means to do the right thing. It was entertaining, and went along quickly. The main character forges friendships and has a f/f crush all while confronting what\u2019s happening in this town\u2014the way her mind works is convincing and vulnerable. Zombies, myth and magic, and regular-old-worldly-problems mix in Freedom, Iowa. I enjoyed this novella, and while it didn\u2019t blow me away because of a couple little explanatory writing tidbits that got on my nerves, it\u2019s definitely an excellent fantasy to pick up, and I highly recommend it.

Collectivist anarchists call up a spirit to ensure nobody can have power over anybody else. I guess it's supposed to be a meditation on the futility of utopianism and far-left dreams, but it bogged itself down in light urban fantasy style and fell flat. Too much Charles de Lint, not enough Tao Lin. This is a story that needed to be told differently, not in the style of its oppressors.

This short horror novella is a scary one and doesn\u2019t focus on violence, although there is some, but it is not very explicit.Moreover, for the most part of the book, it is rather diffusely scary since it\u2019s unclear what is going on or why, and much of the creepiness depends on the not knowing. I love that. There were some turns of events that made me hold my breath, and I think it\u2019s brilliant how the author is transporting this dread often with just a sentence or two.Also, there are birds\u2026 And I just had a full-body shiver with goosebumps and all, just writing this down.The book features several LGBTQIA characters who all have their own hinted at background, but, interestingly, this is not important for the story at hand. I really liked that, though, because it gives the characters depth and I think it is a great representation as well.I liked the language in this novella. It is elegant yet simple, somehow down to earth yet beautiful. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a reason why I was hooked from the very beginning when I started reading the book. Another reason is that there are often some interesting details in situations that give insight into the characters and help build the scenes, which is also the case for the opening scene of the book that starts with Danielle and a knife in a car.The setting is a contemporary one, although there is some magic involved, and the story takes place in a mostly-abandoned small town. I liked the combination of seclusion and connectivity via means like mobile phones and Instagram.The thematic background of anarchy and commune living, for a lack of a better word, was interesting to me, although I don\u2019t actually think about alternative society models that much. I am sure other readers might even enjoy this more than I did.Some questions this book raises concerning this are: Is life in a group or society possible without any kind of authority? And if not authority, then maybe entity or belief? Or is there always something? Something that people adhere to or use, be it on purpose or not\u2026The solution to, not these questions, but the scary demon thingie in the book\u2014 I have to say, I am not quite sure about it. I don\u2019t exactly feel let down by it, but it felt a tiny bit rushed to me, and that way a bit hard to understand. At least I got the feeling that I was missing out, a little. But I do see how the solution fits into the theme of anarchy and power, and, like I said, I am not bummed about it, just there was more potential in the execution, I guess.However, the atmosphere, the writing style, and the characters make this a very compelling read and I leave you with my favourite quote. I needed to hear that again and am grateful I found it here.\n\u201cToday, though, today you\u2019re alive.

I've read other, shorter, stories from Margaret Killjoy and they're usually the epitome of punk - short, punchy, and unapologetically unusual. That wouldn't always translate well to a longer form, but this book mellows out just enough. Mirroring the storyline, it's the punk that's found home, that can relax while staying true to themselves.Danielle Cain is a semi-autobiographical character but isn't pulled into becoming a Mary-Sue. Hoping for answers after a friend's suicide, she finds her way to Freedom; a town abandoned before being adopted by anarchists. As with all idealist utopias, there are those who would see it as a chance for their own private kingdom - and that's when the tale took a turn, and a force is summoned that will go so much further than they can control.While this book deals mainly in aftermath, the quality of the writing and the potential for the rest of the series were really fantastic.

Danielle Cain is a smart, resourceful heroine, and I am looking forward to the further adventures of her and the friends she makes in this book. However, the real star of\u00a0The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion\u00a0is its unique setting--a utopian squatters' community in the imaginary Freedom, Iowa--and the magic with which Margaret Killjoy has infused it. The three-antlered deer spirit summoned by some of the town's residents to assert order in a crisis has begun to turn on its summoners, and the debate over what to do about it has created deep divides in the community. Killjoy's cast of characters must wrestle with ideas at the core of their beliefs and deal with a situation that threatens the very foundations of the home and families they've built for themselves, and the setting of Freedom is a cleverly crafted heightened reality in which to do so.Read more reviews at SF Bluestocking."}, {"userName": "Rachel Pollock", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5277674-rachel-pollock", "userReview": "I knew I was going to love this book.

I'm particularly interested in following this novella initiative by the publisher, too, because I think the form is due for a resurgence.

It would probably be best appreciated it in one sitting, but there is something kind of fun about sneaking a few pages here and there, mostly on buses (with people giving you odd looks as they peer over your shoulder and spot details about demon deer mutilating people) or sitting on the front-step of my house while my kid zoomed back and forth on his bike. At one point I may have said, \"Can you please go and annoy your dad, I literally have two pages left\" and he promptly stuck his head right into my book. So, yeah, welcome to: a post-Evangelical mum reviews a novella about anarchist punks whose utopia is haunted by a three-antlered demon deer whom they summoned with witchcraft. Also, everyone is gay or trans or both. So if any of those things is unappealing to you, head on over to my reviews of Amish romances from 2010 instead. Also, I say damn occasionally in this review, and I know that might offend some people, so consider yourselves warned. Whenever I read something written in first-person point of view, I remember just how much I love it. Almost everything I've read by Margaret Killjoy has been writing from this perspective, and she just does it so well. Her characters have these wonderful snarky, honest internal monologues that flow throughout her stories, revealing just enough backstory at the right time, never info-dumping, always making you feel like you intimately know the character but always wanting just a little bit more. I loved that Danielle, the protagonist of The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion, retained her sarcastic wittiness even in the midst of tragedy and panic. Also, her appreciation for the utopia of the town of Freedom? She can flip between freaking out over demon deer, being sarcastic about how awful her situation is, and admire the collection of herbs grown in the town, all in the space of a few pages. That's kind of how my brain works too, so Danielle felt pretty realistic to me.When Danielle enters Freedom, we're introduced to a wonderful collection of characters. And by that I mean, none of them are boring straight white dudes. There are no \"token diverse characters\" in this book--all of them felt entirely authentic and had their part to play in the story. I became especially fond of Brynn, and intrigued by Doomsday as more of her backstory emerged. I bang on about communes and creating authentic, autonomous communities all the time in real life (at one point I think we had a tally going for the number of times I shouted \"We should all just live in a commune!\" at Bible study group) so obviously I liked the setting of Freedom, and the house Danielle shared with her friends. I've read a few stories set in squat houses recently and I find them really intriguing, but I try not to romanticise them too much as I actually own a house and pay a stupid amount of money on a mortgage and still have a moudly bathroom floor and cupboards that are falling apart and no one ever does the dishes and there's weird artwork tacked to all the walls and our idea of decorating is \"throw more cushions and blankets over the stains on the sofa\" so I frequently remind myself that it's basically an expensive squat house. Back to representation and diversity: I read Margaret's Invisible People earlier this year (which is accessible through her Patreon) and it was at a point where I just wasn't capable of writing reviews, but I did take the chance to write \"This is possibly the most accurate depiction of anxiety that I've ever read.\" It's definitely stuck with me, as I don't think I've ever seen a fictional depiction of someone who struggles with anxiety before? Danielle in The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lamb is possibly the second depiction, and maybe I'm just reading the wrong books, but someone other than Margaret Killjoy must be writing characters who battle anxiety and experience panic attacks, right? Because I know at least five people in life who deal with anxiety on a daily basis, myself not included. I'm (thankfully) past the point of having full-blown panic attacks, and my anxiety is mostly related to stress or being around large groups of people (so Edinburgh during Festival season is genuinely terrifying for me, especially with a small child, apologies if you've wondered why we've barely ventured into town this month) but I'm still so grateful for characters like Danielle, where their entire story isn't Let Me Tell You About This Mysterious Thing Called Anxiety, but just, battling demon deer but also having to deal with anxiety because it doesn't magically go away just because something big is going on. So, demon deer. I didn't used to read stuff featuring witchcraft because I grew up in a very superstitious Pentecostal church who talked about demons all the damn time, and as a child I used to be terrified of accidentally summoning a demon. I sometimes experience sleep paralysis and have since I was about eight or nine, and this, uh, interesting upbringing resulted in me being convinced that demons visited me in my sleep. Also, we were discouraged from reading books featuring witches, watching TV shows featuring them (sorry, Sabrina) and even listening to B*Witched the pop-group. Also, apparently all of the Pokemon characters were manifestations of different demons and someone wrote a book on this but I can't find it anywhere on the internet, but I promise you, it was a thing. So, all of this to say: This is probably the first book I've read featuring demons or witchcraft in a really, really long time. Maybe ever? I'm really not familiar with this sort of thing, so I don't have anything to compare it to in order to tell you whether or not it's good. As an anarchist, I did love the whole issue of \"Town summons demon deer to take down evil leader, but actually they're taking control of the town themselves with this spirit, and aren't self-aware enough to realise they've just replaced one hierarchy with another\". I mean, this is a pretty specific niche, and I'm not sure if any of my usual readers are going to be like \"Damn, that's entirely the kind of book I want to read about\" but I really appreciated this depiction of the constant desire to fix society and dismantle systems of oppression, only to just replace them with other, sometimes worse systems. Can we ever create an actual utopia devoid of hierarchical leadership, like Freedom tried to be? Who knows. There are more books about Danielle Cain and her friends, so maybe they'll find or create that utopia eventually. Or just fight more demons. I'm also up for that. I probably need to give this book another read, sometime when I'm not going to be interrupted by a small child demanding that I make him a play-doh spaceship, but I have managed to bash out a semi-coherent review, the first review I've written in about four months, so that's worth celebrating. I often end my reviews with a suggestion of who I'd recommend this book for, but The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion covers so many niches that I don't think I can give a decent suggestion. This was a definite step outside my comfort zone for me (see above comments about Pentecostal baggage) but I really enjoyed it. Even if you're not particularly interested in the politics of maintaining utopias, you might enjoy Danielle's quest to solve the mystery of her friend's suicide, or the creepy not-entirely-dead animals stalking everyone in the town, or just the really authentic characters who all do really stupid things but they're earnest and lovable, especially Brynn. I definitely want to learn more about Brynn in the next book."}, {"userName": "Aleksandra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40511295-aleksandra", "userReview": "The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion is speculative fiction novella and the first book in the series.

The story tackles issues of power, community, anarchism and the practicality of living without government control. The cast is diverse and intersectional. For example, the main character Danielle is bi/pan and she's attracted to woman Brynn whom she mets in Freedom. One of the supporting cast is trans guy, there are numerous queer characters and people of color.The narration seamlessly combines horror elements with serious discussions on nature of power with funny moments of characters bonding over love of trashy straight romances and fanfics.

Like I have 80+ highlights and this is only 130 pages long?Set in an anarchist community, The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion effortlessly portrays the problem with hierarchical societies, whether it's even possible to dismantle systems of oppression and so there's a lot of symbolism in regards to how power corrupts people even in a commune utopia.

Then I read the description, which promised some creepiness, magic, mystery, and even some paranormal vibes, and I was sold! Plot Since this is a novella and therefore very short, the pacing was fast and stuck with it throughout the story and I can always appreciate a well paced plot. The most interesting aspect of the plot for me was the spirit/demon protector of the town, there is a bit of world building provided and we do get some backstory/info on the spirit as well. This is sort of a mix between magical realism and urban fantasy, because the magic/paranormal aspects were there but they weren\u2019t \u201cthrown in our faces\u201d either. It was more on the subtle side. But everything was just SO interesting, I could have read more and more about the world Margaret Killjoy created here!Another big part of the plot revolves around the main character, Danielle Cain, as she tries to find answers about her friend\u2019s sudden suicide by going to one of the last towns he was in: Freedom, Iowa. Danielle and the characters she meets in the town are all punks/anarchists (they use a lot of different terms throughout the book) and \u201csquat\u201d in the houses of the abandoned town. I thought this really provided a unique POV for the story as a whole and I really enjoyed it because I don\u2019t know about you but I certainly haven\u2019t read a lot of books featuring punks/anarchists/wanderers.Another little thing that I personally really liked was the setting. Being from the Midwest myself I don\u2019t see too many books that are set here and it was refreshing to see it and even read mentions of towns/cities I\u2019ve been to. CharactersDanielle Cain, is a pretty great heroine and I related to her a lot since she suffers from anxiety and panic attacks. I thought this was also represented well.There\u2019s some diversity as well featuring POC characters and LGTB characters, at one point in the story a character asks Danielle which pronouns she prefers which was also nice to see.Overall I liked all of the characters, they were all well developed and had personality for such a short story and they were realistic and flawed too. Also they\u2019re just pretty badass. RomanceRomance, thank goodness, isn\u2019t the focus in this novella but there is a bit of one that develops. It isn\u2019t a full blown romance either though, just sort of a crush. So I\u2019m looking forward to a slow burn romance developing! In ConclusionWhat I Liked: Interesting plot Fast pacing Great world building Loved the Midwest setting Well developed characters Unique POV Diverse characters Good anxiety repWhat I Didn\u2019t Like: I would have loved more world building but in a novella this was forgivable Recommend? Overall I really enjoyed this novella it offers not only a unique story but also a unique POV from the characters. I\u2019m definitely excited to see where the rest of the series goes!
