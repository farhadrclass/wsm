This one is now my favorite of hers and- I hate to say it - The Highwayman has given Edward a run for his money. It's one of those \"take me in your arms and kiss me\" type of ones.

The author made me second guess myself, which I enjoyed! I was thankfully oh so right, and very much relieved to have it end just the way I had been hoping... I love books like this! :) Most especially since Robin Hood is my all time favorite Disney movie, so no wonder it appealed to me so. How utterly romantic, my goodness, no wonder I adore Marcia's stories... This book I'd only recommended to those who truly love the romance, like myself. This book got a big happy sigh out of me at the end... It was a library copy, but I think I want my own to read when the men in real life fail to live up to the standard of men such as the Highwayman of Tanglewood!

It wasn't all bad, and don't get me wrong, sometimes I'm in the mood for cheesiness and fluff, but for an author dubbed \"The Queen of Kissing\", I was seriously disappointed. Why? Because it was the kissing scenes (and there are many of them!) that were so ridiculous. By about the 40% mark of the book I had started either laughing, groaning, or rolling my eyes every time the word \"moist\" was used. Really? Does she do that in every one of her books? All the moisture going on in this book was pretty repulsive. It made me think of the way Pen Creed described her cousin Freddy in Georgette Heyer's  The Corinthian  . I believe she said he had a mouth like a fish, and that is what I thought of every time there was \"moist\" kissing in this book. Blech. So while I liked parts of the story (although some of the plot points were pretty ludicrous), and I liked the characters, all the salivation put it down to 2 stars. Someone needs to let me know if it is worth it to even start any of the author's other books."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4515165-sandy", "userReview": "I have FINALLY found it.

I was grinning through most of the book. Great story with lovable characters. Especially Lochlan, he really is a rascal! ;) First Read Aug 2010: I actually finished this one earlier in the week and have finally found a second to sit down and write a review. I think this may have been my favorite McClure book so far. I really enjoyed the story; it has a Robin Hood/Zorro feel to it. It has adventure, mystery, and of course romance. I guess I\u2019ve gotten used to the \u201ccheese factor\u201d in McClure\u2019s books, to the point I hardly notice it anymore. The characters still have odd names, but their personalities are very likable. I thought our leading lady Faris was a great heroine. I liked her from the beginning, I also liked that she addresses the issues of how fast she falls for the Highwayman of Tanglewood. It drives me crazy in stories when couple meet once or twice and are then declaring their undying love. At least in this story they talked about it and it was believable. As for our mystery man, I figure it out right away, but it was still fun reading about him. I liked him in his \u201ctrue\u201d character as well as the Highwayman. Overall, a very enjoyable read and would recommend it to anyone. McClure\u2019s are a little addicting, they have fun stories, good romances and I find myself wanting to read more and more.

But even I have my limits. The writing in this one is overall poor, the story uneventful. In the very beginning our charming highwayman jokes about rape (...) to a girl he just met 2 minutes ago and then forces himself on her. Ofcourse this was her lifelong dream and a life changing experience for her, in the positive sense! . . . Then she dreams, trembles, endeavors, kiss, longs, imagines, eats pie, dreams, trembles, imagines, endeavors, kiss. The end. What really killed this book for me was the excessive use of giggles, chuckles and smiling. I felt I was reading about the Teletubbies!It's NOT cute! It makes the females even more dim-witted then they already are. (There are limits to how much dim-witting one can take, even in fluff) It makes the men unsophisticated and unattractive!Here are 2 short examples of the writing and the annoying overuse (no spoilers):___________________Lillias smiled and giggled. Sighing, she glanced about the room for a moment. \"Faris! Honestly! Fresh flowers?\" she giggled, smiling (...)___________________\"But what of your dress, my love?\" Lord Kendrick asked. He smiled at his intented bride as she smiled at him. \"Do you wish to see it finished?\"\"Indeed, I do!\" Lillias said, smiling.Faris giggled, delighted in Lillias's sudden renewal of spirit___________________About 65% in I could not take one more giggle and closed the book forever.My hats of for keeping it CLEAN, which I do admire.

From the moment I began reading about the infamous Highwayman and Lochlan Rockrimmon, my fate was sealed and I have thanked my lucky stars every day since for putting this book in my hands. I've said it before but I am a HUGE sucker for romance. I revel in the feelings I experience as I read about two people, who after they find one another begin this flirtatious dance with one another that inevitably leads to me covered in goosebumps and desperately in love with the hero. This book catered to EVERY need I have as a hopeless romantic and touched my heart in a most intimate way.Because I review mainly on what I felt as I read and the kind of connection I made with the characters, it's enough to say that the storyline of the book added enough intrigue to keep me engrossed. It is the story of Faris, the young chambermaid who finds herself torn between two men who lay claim to her heart - the handsome rogue called the Highwayman of Tanglewood and the irresistible son of the Lord she serves. Just when I thought I knew who the Highwayman was, something would happen and in a moment of doubt, I would start wondering all over again. As with all Marcia books, the story pulled me in and connected me straight with the characters. The excitement of finding her first love and the thrill that comes of her secret rendezvous with the Highwayman, Farris had me smiling and nervous for her as I slowly watched her relationship unfold. With each passionate kiss and intimate embrace she shared with the Highwayman, I would get a shiver and feel a slight blush. The Highwayman was magnificent and appealed to me on so many levels. He was so heroic and sincere in his feelings for Farris and the way he would talk with her made me sigh. Add then Lochlan into the equation and I was a mess. Lochlan is one of my favorite Marcia men and I'm telling you right now, that man curled my toes. I wanted to reach into the book and PULL HIM OUT!! I loved the sense of humor he had and the way he would defend Faris, even though as some pointed out, she was just a chambermaid. He was the valiant protector in the book and I found him incredibly sexy. I felt for poor Faris because the more she became involved with both of these men, the more tangled her feelings became. If I was in her situation who would I have chosen? The rogue or protector? The stolen kiss in the twilight or the stolen kiss over a plate of pie in the kitchen? The kisses in this book are to DIE for and I'll proudly admit that one of my kissing book crushes is Lochlan. That man can kiss and the passion he shows is breathtaking. How I wished I was Faris as he pushed her up against the wall and kissed her, as he pulled her close against his body and loved her *melts into a puddle* I told you, hopeless romantic.Watching her go through all the emotions connected with such decisions made it an amazing read.The more I read and the deep I became involved in the story, the more my heart raced and stomach dipped. I'm telling you that Marcia McClure has a gift when it comes to writing romance because she was able to tap into the secret desires of women's hearts and create the most extraordinary men. This is a definite must read and one that would be a perfect choice for those new to Marcia. It doesn't matter how many times I read, my reactions are always the same and I'm left with the feeling that as long as there are books like this that celebrate that intimate, romantic connection between two people, that things won't ever be to bleak that we can't hope for a little romance of our own. If you haven't figured it out, I LOVED this book and invite you to join me in my addiction *stops typing and dreamily SIGHES over Lochlan*"}, {"userName": "Kamery Solomon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3916050-kamery-solomon", "userReview": "Let me start by saying that this is probably the only book that I've ever guessed exactly what was going on right from the very beginning, which is saying something because for some reason I never caught on to the whole Ron/Hermonie thing until the last Harry Potter book, even with all the clues in the fourth one (I know, I'm ashamed of me too LOL!). That being said, even though I guessed right I doubted myself about a dozen times throughout the story. Marcia did a very splendid job keeping me on my toes through the whole thing :) I don't even know where to start telling about how much I enjoyed this book. The characters where awesome and very personable, the description of the land/scenery was great, overall I just really enjoyed it! Let's start with the Highwayman. Imagine a type of Zorro character, mixed with Robin Hood (funny fact, my mom and I both see Antonio Banderas as Zorro, yay! However, mom sees Kevin Costner as Robin Hood and I see the cartoon fox from the Disney version lol so I guess I pictured Antonio more than anything else, haha!). Riding around as the man of every woman's dreams isn't all he does, oh no! He robs the mean, greedy, and nasty lords that treat their tenants poorly and take every cent they can get their grubby hands on. He then, like Robin Hood, gives back to the people. What a nice guy, right? Did I forget to mention he has a sexy accent? Faris. The main character. What a sweet girl she is! We find her being rescued from evil in the beginning of the story only to run into the Highwayman and have him steal her kiss. I thought that part was kinda funny because everyone is always saying how the Highwayman is such a gentleman and would never compromise a woman and/or her honor. I guess love at first sight makes it ok to steal kisses, right? She actually gave him the kiss though so I guess that doesn't count as stealing :) As it turns out, there are quite a few men who want Faris as their own; who will she choose? You'll only find out if you read the story! I also want to talk about our books villain, Kade. What a piece of scum! Marcia not only knows how to make women swoon and squee over her hero, she knows how to make them want to take out the villain themselves. I very thoroughly hated Kade the Heinous (so dubbed by a woman in the story, a very fitting name if you ask me), enough to donate a whole paragraph to Marcia in gratitude of her superior skills. Well done! If you haven't noticed by now, I really loved this book (you never know, there could be oblivious readers like me out there!) and I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone. A story that's well told deserves to be suggested and forced upon others to read, haha! I give it 5 out of 5 stars and plead with everyone to read it if they're looking for an exceptional time :)"}, {"userName": "Terry (Ter05 TwiMoms/ MundieMoms)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3043482-terry-ter05-twimoms-mundiemoms", "userReview": "This was a quick and fun read, and I read it when I was sick and needed something not too complicated or long. It was a 3.5 for me but rounding it down as it just did not come up to a four star for me. It is the story of a young chambermaid in some past century \u2013 some time after Robin Hood because he is mentioned in the past tense. Faris is being pursued by the heir of the household where she is working, and his intentions are anything but honorable. A neighboring Lady expresses any interest in her and offers her a place in her home if she ever wants to come. That very night Faris sneaks out with her small bag of belongings and sets out to walk the five miles to the neighboring castle. On the way she meets up with the legendary Highwayman of Tanglewood. Imagine young chambermaid alone in a meadow with masked man dressed all in black riding a big black horse. Yes, the stuff of fairy tales and legends, and this is just what this story is. Faris in all of her inexperience and youth allows him to steal a kiss and of course is in love forever.It is an entire year before she sees the Highwayman again. During that year she becomes best friends with the daughter of the house and loves the life she has there. Both she and her best friend talk and fantasize about the Highwayman, but Faris never reveals that she has met him. Her dear friend is engaged and tells Faris that she likes to pretend that her fianc\u00e9 is the Highwayman and sometimes she thinks it might be true. When the son and heir of the house comes back from being away for two years he adds a great deal to the story.I won\u2019t tell the story here other than to say it is light and fun, rather predictable but then again not. Faris is torn between thinking \u201cher\u201d Highwayman is her friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 or if he is the very handsome head of the Stables who is unmarried and appears interested in her. I changed my thoughts on this several times until the reveal.Cute story although sometimes I tired of Faris and her total innocence. There is a lot of kissing in this story (nothing more) and I also wish the author could have thought of a few more ways to describe a kiss. The word \u201cmoist\u201d just got a little tiresome and not real appealing. This story it totally clean and a very light romance that takes place in a historical time setting. Maybe a bit cheesy but still kept my interest, probably because I was curious as to who exactly the Highwayman was.

She was escaping to a new workplace after receiving an invitation from the lady Rockrimmon.

There was almost no character development of the heroine, Faris. You knew she was beautiful and in love with the highwayman, and that was the extent of it. Seriously, I think 90-95% of her thoughts were mooning over the highwayman and her employer's son. Lochlan was better developed, but rather contradictory. at the beginning it was mentioned he was rather tame, and that the ladies often wished he was more wild, but once he actually appears he is constantly flirting rather obviously with Faris. Another thing that really bothered me was the historical accuracy. If she was the chambermaid, there was no way she would be allowed to address the children of the house by their first name, let alone befriend them. It simply wasn't done, and felt strange and way out of place.And everything just seemed to convenient.

Now I have read many of her books going towards all of them. The best part is that it's perfectly clean romances, which have almost went into distinction. Still, I would recommend this book to anyone who is in the mood for a good story."}, {"userName": "Holli", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5834593-holli", "userReview": "This book was a Christmas gift from my dear friend, Jenny. SHE LOVES ME! :)))) I can not begin to tell you how fabulous this book is! Oh my heart ... and my brain! I have one of those brains that normally can figure out the mystery long before the book reveals it's secrets. Marcia is a genius. She had my brain so twisted up in knots trying to follow all the little clues that I wanted to scream! Just brilliant! I am so sad I didn't savor this one. Sadly I devoured it rather quickly. No matter. This is a book that will get much love over the years. I wish there was an audiobook to keep me company while cleaning! Beyond 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2439366-natalie", "userReview": "This was the right book at the right time. I had just finished a very serious book and I needed some escapism. Thankfully I had purchased and downloaded this ebook from Marcia Lynn McClure's web site. This book has all the classic elements of an escape read. There is a sweet romance, a dashing hero (or two), a little bit of a mystery, and a bad guy who is eventually defeated quite nicely. I especially like the fact that it is set in an unspecified time and place. This is very important for readers (like me) who tend to over think the back ground of a book on occasion. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a sweet romance."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2085991-sam", "userReview": "The plot of this book simply was fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed it though...This is supposed to be a clean novel, and frankly some of her kiss descriptions were border-lining M, plus her excessive use of the adjectives 'hot and moist' for almost every single kiss in the novel, and trust me, there are quite a few. Also using the word flesh, which made things seem dirtier then they were in truth, and using the word 'laboring' four times within 2 pages. A few other grammatical errors took place, but other than that I really loved it. Plus, listening to Phil Coulter's 'The Midnight Well' while reading the end WILL make you woozy, and can indeed turn your legs to jelly, it did mine."}], "description": "Faris gasped as a gloved hand of a sudden covered her mouth from behind. Be still. The Highwayman of Tanglewood owns ya now. Faris smiled...as he whispered, Do not struggle. Ill not harm ya, lass Come away with me, sweet Faris, the highwayman whispered. What say ye? I say, who are you, highwayman? Faris breathed...All romantic thoughts of knights riding to win the fair lady were driven from her mind. A rogue's manner was vastly more delightful! Aye! But that ye should know, sweet Faris, the highwayman whispered. I know you not, sir, Faris said in a whisper. Surely I would remember such a shape of a man.  \"Indeed, would ya, lass? he asked. I would, sir, she answered. Tis well ya know who I am, fair Faris, he whispered, kissing her neck again. I am the Highwayman of Tanglewood. A chambermaid in the house of Tremeshton, Faris Shayhan well knew torment, despair and trepidation. To Faris it seemed the future stretched long and desolate before her -- bleak and as dark as a lonesome midnight path. Still, the moon oft casts hopeful luminosity to light ones way. So it was that Lady Maranda Rockrimmon cast hope upon Farisset Faris upon a different path -- a path of happiness, serenity and love. Faris abandoned the tainted air of Tremeshton in favor of the amethyst sunsets of Loch Loland Castle and her new mistress Lady Rockrimmon. Further, it was on the very night of her emancipation that Faris first met the man of her dreams -- the man of every woman's dreams -- the rogue Highwayman of Tanglewood. Dressed in black and astride his mighty steed, the brave, heroic and dashing rogue Highwayman of Tanglewood stole Faris's heart as easily as he stole her kiss. Yet the Highwayman of Tanglewood was encircled in mystery -- mystery as thick and as secretive as time itself. Could Faris truly own the heart of a man so entirely enveloped in twilight shadows and dangerous secrets?", "title": "The Highwayman of Tanglewood", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4195038-the-highwayman-of-tanglewood", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1310910064l/4195038.jpg", "reviews": 378, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/527011.Marcia_Lynn_McClure", "name": "Marcia Lynn McClure"}], "type": ["Romance", "Romance", "Romance", "Historical", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4195038-the-highwayman-of-tanglewood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10824942-the-highwayman-of-tanglewood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6518031-a-crimson-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1629084.The_Visions_of_Ransom_Lake", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6281917-dusty-britches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1951599.Shackles_of_Honor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1060540.The_Heavenly_Surrender"]}
