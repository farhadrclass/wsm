Having Faith intertwines the story of Steingraber's first pregnancy, birthing, and breastfeeding experiences with a compelling account of how fetal development, breastfeeding, and environmental toxins work. I appreciate the specificity and care of Steingraber's prose: her style expresses wonder at the beauty and complexity of human lives/bodies/brains/breasts/fragility, but not at the expense of mentioning studies' methodological limitations and nuanced findings. This book raises vital questions in an illuminating way.I can see how some readers (especially pregnant, breastfeeding, and/or parenting readers) might be depressed or frightened by the book's emphasis on problems we cannot control by ourselves. But I actually found its emphasis on system-level problems refreshing and encouraging, in that Steingraber constantly challenges the conventional everything-rests-on-the-individual-mother's-shoulders guilt trip. (Perhaps the fact that I already knew some of the scariest stuff helped.) I was also struck, in reading her descriptions of everything that can go wrong in fetal development, with awe and delight at how we all managed to become our human selves--how anything can possibly go right. When I was pregnant with my son, I would have loved reading the early chapters' descriptions of what was happening at the cellular level in my body and in the body it was creating.Here's a link to my longer review.--Oct. 2011: now gradually rereading during my own (2nd) pregnancy ... wow I love those opening chapters!Dec. 2011: finished my second time through; I think if I could assign one book to *everyone*, this would be it--so please go read it if you haven't yet."}, {"userName": "Willie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/379083-willie", "userReview": "I just started this (don't tell my mom), but it is really great so far. Good mix of science and lyricism....--Ok, so it took me six months to finish this, but only because I enjoyed it so much. It is great love story of having a baby, as well as a clearly articulated assessment of scientific risk. One of Steingraber's points is that we humans are not strictly at the top of the food chain-- our nursing infants are. And that every toxin in nature becomes more concentrated as it moves higher up the food chain. Thus the basic question: why is it that mothers are the ones who have to make the difficult choices and sacrifices (especially: breast feeding provides huge benefits vs breast milk is unavoidably contaminated) when the real solution is political action to force the reduction of the harmful chemicals in the first place. Why do we have to wait for \"absolute\" proof, when the mere suggestion that something might be causing serious harm should be reason enough to pull a product and do more safety studies.But the frame of all this is a really lovely and incredible a story of new motherhood."}, {"userName": "amelia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93060-amelia", "userReview": "Now, this book certainly isn't for everyone, especially if he/she will soon become a parent. There is a lot of potentially upsetting material, detailing the environmental pollutants currently present in our world and the often horrifying effects they have on developing fetuses and young children. That said, it felt like the perfect time to read it for me. She juxtaposes her factual information with a month-by-month account of her own pregnancy & breastfeeding, which I found ingenious as a means of both personalizing what she was talking about and drawing me, also currently a pregnant woman, into her own story with relatable anecdotes and feelings. As with anything, it is important to retain some skepticism and I would not take everythin she says at face value without doing some more reading (despite what seems to have been very thorough researching on her part, into a largely unexplored field), but I really recommend thisbook, as it is a topic to which I suspect most of us give very little thought, at least partially because the information is not very accessible.

The author's environmental concerns regarding pregnancy are well conveyed and argued. Anyone who has ecological concerns will find solid backing for legislation in this area. However, all the detailed explanations in scientific jargon were frequently inaccessible for me. It's too bad because I think that knowing how pollutants and chemicals influence an embryo's development are important. She dispenses a lot of useful, but also frightening information. I think it would take a certain kind of reader to enjoy this book while pregnant. If it weren't for the side stories about Illinois, living in Somerville, MA, and more personal accounts about pregnancy and chilbirth...I wouldn't have made it through this book. Those vignettes were my favorite parts.

But it's a perfect fit for me, and I'm really liking it so far. (Although a bit of an odd find right after I finished the neurobiologist's journey to motherhood book...) Good change from the insipid and repetitive week by week books I compulsively read, and doesn't hurt that she had her child the same week that I am due, so even the months fit the timeline - February as \"a return to childhood\" - napping and absurd pickiness with food. That was exactly how I had described the weeks where I ate nothing more nutritious than cheese and chocolate pudding. Her description of stem cells is a perfect analogy to the angst that comes with the decisions that select a path in life: I feel a little like a migrating embryonic cell myself, sent out on a journey that seems not entirely of my own choosing or under my own direction - even though this is a long-hoped for pregnancy. I suspect I will be changed by it, that some new identiy is forthcoming. Restriction points lie ahead. Another thing I like is how the information is grounded in the context of research - just this morning I told my husband that amniotic fluid is baby pee, but couldn't back it up (\"I don't know, I read it in one of those books...\") until getting to the amniocentesis section of this book. Also - for the earliest pregnancy tests, they injected a mouse with the urine of a possibly pregnant woman, then dissected it a week later to see if it had ovulated. Crazy. That said, the emphasis on toxicology and all the potential dangers to a fetus means that it might not be the best pregnancy read for non-science nerds, or people who know they would just worry too much after reading a book about how toxins can affect fetal development."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1014566-elaine", "userReview": "Several people recommended this book to me, a few of whom had used it in classes they teach. I thought I would peruse it as a potential teaching tool (I seem to be collecting works on women's reproductive issues for a class or three in the making) but liked it so much that I read it in full. Steingraber is a really talented writer, with an ability to distill scientific information in a way that is palatable to the general (formally educated) public. She is also a bit of a poet, and in this book was able to weave in her poetry throughout the book. The book centers upon her first pregnancy, and is organized month-by-month around what she experienced as a pregnant woman versus what the scientific literature reports as normal fetal development for each period. She also reviews, as much of her work does, the effect of ubiquitous environmental contaminants on growing embryos. So, as a woman, an academic, a scientist, and expecting mother, she considers some tough reproductive issues through each of these lenses. I thought this was a great book, and I almost bought it for a few friends and relatives who are expecting children. I only hesitated to buy it for them, because I figure expecting mothers don't need more to worry about when it comes to the health of their child (why distress them further??? - particularly when you're familiar with the literature on reproductive stress). But it is an informative piece that is relatively easy to read.

I normally don't like books which alternate between personal narrative writing and informative/educational writing, but I guess I liked both aspects of this book. I think anyone who is a parent with a job in academia will appreciate the personal tale. I found the scientific sections invigorating, which is no small feat when the topic of environmental exposures is so commonly overplayed and offputting to a scientist. Here the case under question is mainly the contamination of human breast milk. I thought she did a great job of digging into a wide range of evidence, discussing limitations in the evidence, and keeping things balanced while making it clear that there is a lot of disturbing stuff going on out there. I think this is the best book I've read on environmental exposures. One point that will stick with me is that it is the human infant that sits on top of the food chain and consumes the highest concentration of pollutants that bioaccumulate in the food chain.

She definitely convinced me that tighter regulations on toxic chemicals are essential to the health of the next generations of humans - as well as other species.Pretty much everyone should read this, especially those who make decisions about levels of regulation on toxic or understudied chemicals in the environment.

There is so much in our environment that can negatively affect fetal development that it is truly a miracle we all come out as normal as we do.I love the way Steingraber organized this book.

The book reads alternatively like a science book and a memoir, and I really enjoyed the marriage of the two. The \"science\" parts are done in a way that makes them relatively easy to understand, and they're interspersed with stories of the author's own experiences being pregnant and mothering her daughter in the first couple years of her life.[return][return]But what I most enjoyed about this book was the frankness about environmental hazards and their impact to pregnant and nursing mothers and their children, such as industrial poisons that wind up in amniotic fluid. If only everyone looked at things the way the author does, we'd have much safer pregnancies and children.[return][return]Here are a few parts of the book that really stood out to me:[return]* If our goal is to protect human embryos, we cannot afford to wait until we understand everything about how a chemical might inflict its damage.[return]* ...the presumption that heredity can account for many birth defects continues to this day, even though there is little evidence to support it...In fact, most of what is known about developmental abnormalities points to a much larger role for the environment.[return]* Besides, the sense of safety offered by bottled water is a mirage. It turns out that breathing, not drinking, constitutes our main route of exposure to volatile pollutants in tap water, such as solvents, pesticides, and byproducts of water chlorination. As soon as the toilet is flushed or the faucet turned on--or the bathtub, the shower, the humidifier, the washing machine--these contaminants leave the water and enter the air. A recent study shows that the most efficient way of exposing yourself to chemical contaminants in tap water is to turn on a dishwasher. (This surprises you?) Drink a bottle of French water and then step into the shower for ten minutes, and you've just received the exposure equivalent of drinking a half gallon of tap water.[return][return]She also recommends finding out what the Toxics Release Inventory shows for your community if you're pregnant or planning to be, so I'm off to do that now..."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/833298-erin", "userReview": "I was already disinclined to have children, any youthful and idealistic desire to bear fruit having slowly been eroded away over the years by tales from all my friends' experiences. This book sent the Reproductive Desire-o-Meter plunging even more sharply south. It struck terror into my soul.The author, an ecologist, describes her personal journey through pregnancy and breastfeeding through the eyes of a pragmatic scientist, using her experience in studying environmental toxins to illustrate the dangers posed to babies by all the crap we've put in the air, water and our food. At each point in development, she tells about all the horrible things that can go wrong at that point, caused by the chemicals that get through the placenta and through the milk glands. Since babies are at the very top of the food chain, they are burdened with all the happy effects of biomagnification...all those toxins get more and more concentrated with every level up the chain. This book makes me never want to eat fish again, and perhaps move to the middle of nowhere.Not that it's a bad book. It's well researched, and makes the good point that we need to make a bigger fuss about the companies that are knowingly putting these pollutants out there, making our children mentally retarded immunological disasters. I also enjoyed her stories about her pregnancy, which were funny, scientifically-minded and avoided getting all cutesy and emotional. I did find it repetitive in places, and thought the transitions from personal narrative to scientific discussion were a bit contrived at times. According to the author, pregnancy books gloss over this kind of information, or flat-out lie about it, so as not to upset expecting mothers. I think it would be a good thing for them to read, actually, because it does contain a few do-able suggestions to lower the chances of contaminating your baby."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41165-jamie", "userReview": "I first heard about this book through Mother Earth magazine, after which I ordered it immediately. The book is strikingly unique and refreshing in its approach to pregnancy and environmental contaminants. Writing from her own perspectives both as a first-time pregnant woman and as one who has deeply researched the ways in which humans are affected by chemical contaminants, she shares poetically and factually, interspersing her own experiences in pregnancy with detailed research which is enormously helpful as well as easily digestible for those who are not trained in ecology. This is tremendously more helpful than most books on pregnancy that I have read, as many focus on what is happening to the woman but have no answers for those who would question what they are eating or otherwise ingesting. Complete with detailed analyses on the benefits of breastmilk, yet at the same time the unavoidably contaminated nature of it, this book is truly one that I would recommend to everyone I know. The only disagreement that I had with the author is in her belief that our bodies evolved, whereas I believe that they were created. For the most part, this book reads like a warm, deeply satisfying conversation with a friend who has spent years researching the evidence and studies surrounding miscarriage, birth defects, and environmental contaminants. It is certainly eye-opening, and I have read some reviews which advise against reading it while pregnant, but I certainly do not. The topic of my baby's well-being is at the forefront of my mind, and at three months pregnant, I have not only deeply appreciated it but also feel strongly that it should be read by all those who care about the health of the human race, whether or not they personally intend to have children.

Nothing is very conclusive in these areas, so I wouldn't exactly say she's *wrong*; and she certainly was not self-righteous on the topics (like many people can get).

Before reading \"Having Faith\" I had never thought of my gestating uterus as a marshland, but now it all seems so logical.The tone, though, was just the icing on the information-packed cake. This book is packed with information about the environmental contaminants that are threatening our health and, especially, the health of fetuses and babies.

Best nonfiction I've read in a long time. I've been recommending it to everyone.

But Steingraber pulls apart the behavioral narrative on all the foods/activities pregnant and nursing mothers should avoid, exploring how some of these dangers are the result of unchecked industrial processes and the unchecked political power that allows them. It's about shifting the burden of proof to the polluters rather than where it currently it is: pregnant women and children.
