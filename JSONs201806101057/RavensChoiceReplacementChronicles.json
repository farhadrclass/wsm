It was very short and somewhat disconnected: the premise being a young man who finds he has Neanderthal DNA and then we flash back to the young girl who has intercourse with a Neanderthal and introduced the humans to it. Not particularly imaginative or compelling for me. And I kind of wonder what the point is."}, {"userName": "Cathy Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7796704-cathy-ryan", "userReview": "This is my first foray into prehistoric fiction. It\u2019s never really appealed before, not sure why, but I found this fascinating and totally intriguing. Mark Heyek from the Parkinson\u2019s Institute is a research scientist working in the field of genetics. Having sent a saliva sample to Genetics and Me, Inc. for further research into Parkinson\u2019s disease, and as lead collaborator, he is invited to attend a meeting. What follows is an amazing fictional, although based on scientific knowledge, look back at the genetics that make up modern man.The story transports us back thousands of years and introduces Raven, a healer who has lost her husband and, because she\u2019s also childless, has been banished from her tribe. Raven\u2019s sister, Willow, has persuaded her mate, Bear, to allow Raven to join their own tribe. As Bear is bringing Raven home they happen upon a group of trespassing Neanderthals hunting Bison, one of whom is seriously hurt during the hunt. After Bear\u2019s group have taken possession of the Bison meat and the \u2018Longheads\u2019 have been sent on their way the injured Neanderthal is taken back to Bear\u2019s tribe. Bear doesn\u2019t want to provoke a war between the tribes so Raven tends to his injuries until he is released. Raven feels an affinity with the \u2018Longhead\u2019 and when she awakens one morning to find him gone she follows him to say goodbye. The idea that the choices Raven makes would impact on the genetic history of modern man is incredibly thought-provoking.Raven\u2019s hard, and sometimes cruel, world is brought vividly to life and even though she has been taken into her sister\u2019s tribe her life, as a woman in those times, is not her own. She\u2019s entirely at the mercy of the tribe leader and bound by their way of life as is shown by Bear\u2019s conduct towards her.Not only is the order and ranking in tribal law detailed, but also how Early Modern Humans and Neanderthals might have come into contact and reacted with each other. As Mark finds out, many people including himself, carry Neanderthal genes although he\u2019ll never know for sure the exact circumstances that brought about this occurrence. But it signifies that Early Modern Man didn\u2019t take the place of extinct Neanderthals but rather the races mixed and interbred, which is proved by the presence of Neanderthal DNA in present day man. It\u2019s such an interesting approach to how life might have been all those years ago, and even more so because it\u2019s a very credible scenario. A wonderfully researched, dramatic and detailed narrative sets the scene for forthcoming instalments of The Replacement Chronicles, which I look forward to following."}, {"userName": "Rosie Amber", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12118203-rosie-amber", "userReview": "Raven's choice is a short historical fiction book, just fifty seven pages long and the first book in The Replacement Chronicles series. It's like a tantalising introduction to what there is to come. The book has two time settings the first is California in the twenty first century, the second is set in the late Pleistocene era (think early man),In the present day Mark Hayek works for the Parkinson's Institute as part of Genetics and Me Inc. He's recently been asked to provide a saliva sample as part of some routine investigations.The reader is then taken back in time to meet a group of early humans travelling back to their tribe when they come across a bison hunt led by a despised group they call \"Longheads\". Neither of the two groups like or accept each other, their ways being alien to the other group. Yet there are clues that this may well change in the future.The book ends back in present time looking at Neanderthal ancestry and genetics through the generations, leaving the reader with plenty of questions to be answered in the next book in the series.This is a good storyline and made me immediately think of very popular Clan Of The Cave Bear series. The present day parts were written in present tense third person and didn't quite work for me."}, {"userName": "Ane Cristi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3976169-ane-cristi", "userReview": "Don't read this book. Really not worth it.Reasons:1- It's like this first book, which should be the first of a trilogy, is the firts chapter of a book, a catch for us to buy the others, since the first is free. It has only 52 pages against 303 of the second. It does not have an end, the history simply does not finish.2- No maps, no indication whatever of where the story sets.3- No descriptions of the culture, very few descriptions of the places they are, it's really only the action but we keep lost in my opinion without the environment!4- No context whatever. When the story set? In which date? Does the homo sapiens are already well developed, which tools he already know and which he does not how? Without the time desciption is impossible to know. I will definitelly not continue with the other books. Comparing to Ayla's story on the Earth Children's saga or to the trilogies of Sue Harrison, this book is way way worse."}, {"userName": "vivian dodd", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37472474-vivian-dodd", "userReview": "Very good read, as good as the series of The Clan of the Cave Bear.I enjoy reading these kinds of books, that go along with some of the modern discoveries.

I don't know why it gets compared to Jean M. Auels series and the like. It is so short that one cannot even say much about it. Obviously this little tidbit is supposed to make the readers buy the rest of the series. Maybe those books are better. This one however was very superficial. Also, it's supposed to be up to date with current scientific knowledge. I'm not sure it is (the little that is included in this book). At least the Neanderthals have a language...still they come across as a kind of brutish type of human. Also, the bit we get to know about the social structure of the tribe and their way of life, it is so so little. I don't want an info dump, but I want a setting to feel alive and real.Will not continue with this series."}, {"userName": "N.A.

The author uses the recent discovery that Neanderthal and Homo sapiens interbred and weaves just such a story. It begins in the present when Mark Hayek finds out from a company called Genetics and Me \u2013 which he had hoped would help him with Parkinson\u2019s research \u2013 had actually tested his genome for Neanderthal DNA. And found it.The book then drops back in time to the Late Pleistocene era in western Asia, where a band of early modern humans, led by Bear and including Raven, a healer and sister to his wife, come upon a group of Neanderthals hunting bison. They drive off the Neanderthals and take the bison the group had killed for meat, but also take one who was injured in the attack as a prisoner. Raven takes a deep interest in the man, watching him closely.Bear throughout treats Raven, the new member of his family, with disdain, but nevertheless takes her as his mate, once the hunters have returned to their tribal home. Raven then uses what little hold she has over Bear to be allowed to reset the prisoner\u2019s dislocated shoulder. As a former EMT, I found the description of this process to be spot on. Two things occur to confound Raven: her sister treats her coldly in response to Bear\u2019s absence from the tent at night, and suddenly the prisoner is gone, freed to return to his own tribe. Intermingled with Raven\u2019s adventure are details of early human life in tribal groups and wonderful descriptions of the tribal hierarchy, food, and hunting, creating a rich palette against which the story is told. You absolutely need to read this book to find out how Raven will handle her sister\u2019s rebuke and whether Raven cares enough about the Neanderthal to follow him when he leaves. And what about Mark\u2019s Neanderthal genes?This story is, to my untrained eyes, meticulously researched, and has a great premise. I am hooked and looking forward to the next novella."}, {"userName": "Sheila", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2039269-sheila", "userReview": "If you liked Jean Auel\u2019s Earth\u2019s Children series, or Kathleen Flannigan\u2019s Misfits and Heroes, and you like fast reads, you will probably enjoy Harper Swan\u2019s Raven\u2019s Choice. First in the Replacement Chronicles, it blends past and present, combining stories of cause with effect as a young man at a present day conference learns the mysteries hidden in DNA.Back in the past, a young woman who feels as surely out of place as her present-day counterpart, faces the struggle to fit into a changing society without the protection of a husband. The story is starkly true to life, well-researched, and pleasingly convincing. Raven has a choice to make, and someone always has to be first; someone must surely be the ancestor, and the ancestor\u2019s decision might ring its results over farflung times.By the end of this novella, Raven\u2019s unclear future has a definite direction. Readers will be satisfied to have seen and guessed her choice, but will still want more. Hopefully that is what the author will offer. But this bite-sized piece stands alone as an intriguing, fast-told novella of small decisions and major implications, in a convincingly drawn, hard and beautiful, distant world.Disclosure: I was given a free ecopy and I offer my honest review."}, {"userName": "Bonnye Matthews", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14618880-bonnye-matthews", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book and the interaction between the Neanderthals and Cro-magnons.

It has everything to do with an encounter between a band of Early Modern Humans and a group of Neanderthals intent on hunting bison.After an injured Neanderthal hunter is taken captive, Raven\u2013\u2013as a healer\u2013\u2013feels she has no option but to become his advocate. Her own survival soon becomes doubtful when the band\u2019s leader threatens to cast her out onto the steppe for what he sees as dangerous willfulness. Raven feels an unexpected empathy for the mysterious Neanderthal. But while trying to preserve his life and health, will she go so far as to commit what could be the worst error of her own life? Mark Hayek will never find out that Raven faced a frightening dilemma. But if he did know, he would understand that the present reality exists because of choices made in the past.
