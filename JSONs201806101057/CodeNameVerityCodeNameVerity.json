Code Name Verity is one of those books that are the reason why I created the shelf its-me-not-you. I mentioned this very recently in my review of The Book Of Blood And Shadow and it is also similar to the experience I had trying to read The Book Thief and Feed. I just found 90% of the book long-winded and unnecessary.The novel opens where the narrator has been captured by the Nazi opposition during WWII. She is given paper to tell her story and she does so through the eyes of her friend Maddie. Different, definitely. Maddie's story is told in various anecdotes, a technique I've already failed to appreciate in The Book Thief but I suppose the intention was to subtly build up a picture of both girls' pasts and their friendship. This book is not very plot-focused or fast-paced, it's about conversations and people and female pilots during the second world war, which would all have been great if it had been balanced out with a touch of drama.I cannot tell you just how much I wanted to like this. It's about women's involvement in the war and us Northern girls - two topics that don't get nearly enough press. But, for me, there was just too big a focus on piloting and aircraft and I'm sorry but I struggled to care. If you read the author's note at the end she will tell you that this book is actually meant to be about pilots:\"This book started off rather simply as a portrait of an Air Transport Auxiliary pilot. Being a woman and a pilot myself, I wanted to explore the possibilities that would have been open to me during the second world war.\"And not enough else was brought in. There's only so many descriptions of a pilot's job I can sit through before I start to snooze, each to their own but flying planes has never been an interest of mine. The best parts of this book were the touching ending and the fact that the narrator is delightfully unreliable (I love them, I do! Eugenides, I miss you...) but I needed more. All I really want is for a book to rouse some passion in me, whether it be excitement, sadness, anger even... I felt nothing."}, {"userName": "Maggie Stiefvater", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246837-maggie-stiefvater", "userReview": "I\u2019ll confess right up front that I\u2019m not usually a big historical fiction fan. I realize this seems somewhat hypocritical of me, as I was a history major in college and adore history, but a lot of times, I find historical fiction more impenetrable than a primary source document. The characters either don\u2019t feel like real people to me, or they feel like modern people to me. I get distracted by historical info-dumps and bored by epic scale machinations. Basically, I like my historical fiction very personal and very intimate. So when I got sent a copy of Code Name Verity, I thought, okay. I\u2019ll read twenty pages and then I\u2019ll give it to my sister. But my sister has not yet gotten this book, because I don\u2019t want to let it out of my house yet. I adored it. 1. First of all, I believe it. The people feel like real people to me, and the details feel like real details. ARE they real details? Possibly not. We all slip up on our research sometimes, but man, this stuff feels genuine. The main character\u2019s best friend is a pilot, and that part I knew was real even before I read that Elizabeth Wein had a pilot's license. I could feel the real-life love and knowledge of flying seeping through the pages. It was grand.2. It doesn\u2019t feel like anything I\u2019ve read before \u2014 certainly not in YA. Not just in genre or in subject matter, but just . . . the characters are unique and specific people and the situations they\u2019re in are unique and specific. It feels like I looked through a tiny window into a real life, and that\u2019s just not something you can cut and paste. 3. As with all my favorite books, it rewards the careful reader. If an author can make me gasp once, it\u2019s likely that novel is ending up on my favorites shelf. If an author can make me gasp THREE TIMES, either the author is making me read their novel underwater or it\u2019s really cleverly done. This one\u2019s really cleverly done. It was a three-gasper. When was the last time I read a three gasper? I don\u2019t remember. Maybe when I read THE MONSTRUMOLOGIST underwater . . . Now, that said, CODE NAME VERITY is not a fast read. If you go into it expecting to whip through it in an evening or even two, you\u2019re not doing it justice. Give the characters some time to infest your heart.4. It\u2019s hard, but not harrowing. This is worth pointing out, because the central premise is that the narrator has been shot down over occupied France and is now being tortured for her confession. It could be awful. Sort of like BETWEEN SHADES OF GRAY, which I also loved, but would never read again because of how hard it was. This book, on the other hand \u2014 not only does it have so many lovely and sweeping moments, but it\u2019s also surprisingly funny. I laughed out loud several times. Thought when I tried to explain to Lover why I was laughing, I invariably failed. LOVER: I thought you said she was being tortured? ME: Yeah, but, the Hitler line, it . . . never mind. 5. It stuck with me. This, to me, is the Holy Grail of novels. I love some novels and forget them the moment they\u2019re out of my sight. Other novels I love and then they become part of me for days or weeks or forever. I will be reminded of them at the strangest moments. CODE NAME VERITY does more than stick with me. It haunts me. I just can\u2019t recommend it enough. I can\u2019t even make this recommendation funny. I love it too much."}, {"userName": "Rick Riordan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25375513-rick-riordan", "userReview": "My final foray into World War II territory (for now, anyway) is Elizabeth Wein's Code Name Verity, a young adult novel which really defies description, but I'll try. At its heart, Code Name Verity is the story of two young British women, Maddie and Queenie (or Julie), who undertake a secret mission behind enemy lines in Occupied France in 1943. The novel begins as a confession being written by Queenie while being held as a prisoner of the Gestapo. Clearly, her mission has gone terribly wrong. Queenie has been captured, tortured, and forced to write her story for her interrogators, and while that story is fiercely compelling in itself, the more we read, the more we begin to sense that there is more to Queenie and her mission that we are being told. Without giving anything away, I can tell you that there are games within games being played here. The whole experience for the reader parallels what the characters are feeling. Who is telling the truth? Whom can we trust? Who is an agent, a double-agent, a collaborator, a spy? Wein clearly knows her subject matter, whether it is airplanes (the author is a pilot) or life during World War II. Her characters are so real they leap off the page. Maddie and Julie embody courage, pluck and humor even in the darkest of circumstances. By turns heartrendingly sad and fiercely uplifting, Code Name Verity is the best YA book I've read in a long, long time. If you like historical fiction, or spy thrillers, or just books that constantly surprise you with, \"OH MY GOD, THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON???\" moments, you should really read this. (I include both versions of the US cover, as it has changed. Which do you like best?)"}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4222084-maggie", "userReview": "Do you remember when The English Patient came out? Or rather, do you remember when the Seinfeld episode about The English Patient came out? (Elaine goes to see it and HATES it, and is either shunned or dragged back to the theater to rewatch because everyone else loves it. She ends up getting sent to Tunisia by her boss, J. Peterman, because the movie was filmed there. Cameo by Holly the waitress/witch from True Blood playing a waitress.)I'm usually Elaine in these situations, so I worried a little bit after reading glowing review after glowing review of Code Name Verity. However, this book held my attention from the beginning, and I want to send all the Elaines to Ormaie for inspiration.*Something that I see authors and filmmakers struggle with is how to portray a strong, kick-ass female who can hang with the boys and still retain her femininity. One way is to sexualize them a la Angelina Jolie, and another way is to claim they are the fiercest assassin of all time and then have them fawn over pretty dresses. See, she's tough but girly! Yes, I read Throne of Glass just before Code Name Verity. Elizabeth Wein, however, makes it look so simple with her portrayal of Queenie. Little details like neatly arranged hairpins and well maintained fingernails say so much more than a ball gown, and it keeps you within the context of the story.Speaking of the story, it's set during World War II when most of the men are off fighting. Still, given the current state of YA, I fully expected a love triangle to somehow get shoehorned in. I did get a love story, but not the one I dreaded/expected.\"It's like being in love, discovering your best friend.\"The friendship between Queenie and Maddie, two people from different backgrounds who wouldn't have met under ordinary circumstances, is one that I loved reading. It's the bond between two soldiers who contribute to the war effort in their different ways, whether it's aviation or language proficiency. The story jumps from present to past, but I loved seeing how their relationship evolved. One discussion that struck a nerve with me was when early in their friendship, they talk about their fears. In your 20s, the looming milestone is 30. When people asked me what I was going to do for 30, I would say, \"Ugh, kill myself!\" It's the vanity and arrogance of youth, of privilege, of safety. Queenie is the same, until that privilege is no longer in her control. She says,\"I am no longer afraid of getting old. Indeed I can't believe I ever said anything so stupid. So childish. So offensive and arrogant. But mainly, so very, very stupid. I desperately want to grow old.\"Queenie is one of my favorite characters ever, up there with Evanjalin from Finnikin of the Rock. Her intelligence and boldness comes through the page, and Wein's writing exemplifies the principle of \"show, don't tell.\" I loved this story of war, camaraderie, and sacrifice. I loved Queenie's mother, who left the windows open in her house in the hope that her children would be home soon, because this is also a story about faith. Queenie and Maddie have to have faith in each other and faith in the strangers on whose help they depend. This was one of my favorite books of 2012, and one I highly recommend. I have told the truth.Rating: 5/5 stars.This review appears on Young Adult Anonymous.--*No Elaines were harmed in the writing of this review."}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "Reviewing this book feels much like walking through a minefield. (Not that I know what that feels like, but I can imagine, you know.) On the one hand, I can\u2019t reveal too much of the plot. I can\u2019t reveal almost anything, really, lest I ruin the experience for you guys. On the other hand, I have to write just enough to make you want to pick this book up because it\u2019s one you don\u2019t want to miss. Trust me. I suppose I could just point you to Maggie Stiefvater\u2019s wonderful review and leave it to her to convince you, but I\u2019m not that much of a coward. *coughs* I just did that! *coughs*So here goes nothing\u2026 I don\u2019t normally read historical fiction unless it\u2019s highly recommended. Code Name Verity was, directly or indirectly, recommended to me by two of my trusted friends, Chachic and Jo, and, as I already mentioned, my favorite young adult author Maggie Stiefvater. And of course they were right. Code Name Verity is a story about two best friends, Maddie and Queenie, fighting in World War II. They probably never would have met in peacetime, as they come from entirely different circles of society: Queenie is Scottish royalty who grew up in a castle, while Maddie is a bike shop owner\u2019s granddaughter. That didn\u2019t stop them from becoming best friends while serving together in WAAF (Women\u2019s Auxiliary Air Force), and staying close even when the war took them in different directions. All Maddie ever wanted was to fly airplanes. She was in training before the war and when the war started, she waited patiently for them to accept female pilots, which eventually they did. Queenie\u2019s talents lie elsewhere: she is fluent in both German and French and able to momentarily slip into any role, be herself one second, and someone entirely different the next. Although these two have very little in common on the surface, deep down they are both incredibly strong, intelligent and compassionate women. But for me, the most fascinating character was Queenie\u2019s capturer, Hauptsturmf\u00fcrer von Linden. He starts as pure evil, of course, but as the story progresses, we are offered small details of his life that give him an entirely different face, one that is complex and multi-layered and that causes the reader to be just as conflicted as Queenie. I don\u2019t know what I expected, but he just looked like anybody - like the sort of chap who would come into the shop and buy a motorbike for his lad\u2019s 16th birthday \u2013 like your headmaster.Our story starts when Queenie gets captured by the Gestapo in France. Upon breaking her with torture and turning her into a collaborator, von Linden allows her to write down the events that led her to his cruel hands, and her written testimony is what we are given. The narrative itself takes some getting used to. Queenie tells her present story in first person, but switches to third person and focuses on Maddie every time she talks about the past. It was a little strange at first, having the narrator talk about herself in third person, but I soon realized that it was an excellent way for Wein to help her readers adapt to constant alternations between the past and the present. Every once in a while you know that you\u2019ve stumbled upon a classic. Code Name Verity might have been published in 2012, but there is no doubt in my mind that it will endure the test of time. It has the weight (although not quite the genius) of The Book Thief. I'm sure it will receive awards and critical acclaim.

The first thing I did after I finished reading this book was to pick up my phone and text my best friend, who I have known since I was eleven and has been there through every single one of my problems and ill-advised fringes, and tell her that I loved her.The second thing I did after I finished reading this book was flip back to the beginning and start reading it again. I don\u2019t mind admitting that it took me and this book a while to really get going.. The way this book was written with all the capital letters bothered me and the changing in perspectives and everything really confused me. It took me a good 100 pages to get into but seeing as this book is over 400 pages long; that was absolutely fine.And after those first 100 pages, I learnt the truth and that is: This book is fantastic.I knew I\u2019d love it when I was noseying at the wonderful Chachic\u2019s status updates and then I read the synopsis.Spies? Pilots? Codes? Secrets? History? Best friends? \n Mancunians?!\nThese are a few of my favourite things\u2026I loved the setting. I loved the plot. I loved the era. And the twists absolutely threw me (although, I did have the smallest of small inklings of one thing but that\u2019s only because I have a clever dad who eats history books for breakfast and I accidentally asked a question that got made me put a few things together\u2026)The twist and the ending\u2026. I just can\u2019t even think about them without jibbering.Code Name Verity is The Usual Suspects of YA literature.Like I said above, the second thing I did after I finished reading this book was to go back to the beginning and read over certain parts again. I know that this book will be one of those books that will get better and better every time I read it.I loved Verity. I loved Maddie. They were real girls. They laugh, they cry, they flirt with boys, they gossip, they\u2019re loyal, they fly planes, they can land planes, they can speak different languages, they can crack codes, they can do the unthinkable, they do the right thing. I loved that, with Maddie and Verity, Ms Wein showed that you can be strong, you can be brave, you can be good at what you do, you can be the best at what you do and you can do all this without sacrificing your femininity and/or becoming a passive-aggressive \u201cmessage\u201d. There was never a sense that these ladies did what they did in a \u201cLook! Look! We can do it too. We\u2019re just as good as boys!\u201d and because they had something to prove.They were such rich and beautiful characters and I loved, loved, loved them both so dearly. And, anyway, boys didn\u2019t even get a look in. They wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with any of the girls in this book.Pffft.;-)The phrase \u201cCareless talk costs lives\u201d is mentioned frequently in this book and I couldn\u2019t help but be reminded of this poster:[Here!]Also, the fact that that I own that very poster [bought from the Imperial War Museum North, I\u2019ve still not been to the London one, or the Churchill War Rooms, yet\u2026 one day :) ] and it is hanging up on my bedroom wall\u2026.that helped too. So that\u2019s it. That\u2019s my review.

I am very distraught. I did not like this book as much as I\u2019d hoped and it breaks my heart. I'm aware that we can't love every book we read and you may think it a tad dramatic of me to say these things but WWII historical fiction is a (sub) genre that I've rarely been let down by. If ever.This had all the makings of a potential favourite yet somehow missed the mark. I'm still reeling from it.Set in the turmoil of the Second World War, the book follows the fate of two young British women: Maddie, a modest pilot, and Julie, an aristocratic Scotswoman turned spy. I loved the story just not the way in which it was told.It took me so long, SO LONG to get into the book and I almost I considered giving up completely \u2013 mainly because I struggled to follow what was going on, and was confused by all the plane jargon, coded abbreviations, jumping between different time periods, and rambling writing style. it all felt a bit haphazard. There were so many things I couldn't understand like Julie\u2019s determination to bargain for extra time to finish her story when it would just prolong her suffering, but my biggest source of confusion was why the Germans were so keen for her to write it, as it contained very little information on the British War Effort that would actually be of any use to them. I was frustrated by how difficult it was to grasp why certain things were happening, such as the interview with an American journalist, or even why Maddie and Julie spent a whole day trying to cycle to a caf\u00e9 in the rain.The second half of the story shed so much light on almost all of the puzzles and I got more into the story as the book went on.Needless to say, I was absolutely unprepared for the ending. That damned shocking ending which felt like a punch in the throat. It was such an unfair twist that I can\u2019t, for the life of me, get it out of my head.

Apparently broken by Nazi torture, she begins to write her confession, doling out bits of information to her Nazi captors to motivate them to keep her alive and refrain from further torture. She has been spying for the Allies, so her prospects for a long life are dim.Verity tells the tale of her involvement with the British war effort, spiced with bits of information about airplane types and airfield names to keep the Nazis at bay. But somehow her writing tells more about her developing friendship with Maddie, a British pilot who (against all rules and regulations for female pilots) flew her to France for this mission. The two girls come from different walks of life and have different talents and interests, but as they are periodically thrown together during the war they find that they are kindred souls.It's like being in love, discovering your best friend.This book also shows so many different faces of heroism, sometimes in heartbreaking ways. It's not an easy or light read--I think I spent the last 50 pages sniffling and wiping my eyes. I can't say it's a perfect book. There are some slow parts where I just wanted the story to kick into a higher gear: We already read about this event from a different POV and know what happened, so why are we belaboring this part of the past? Move along! And it's non-linear, moving back and forth between the past and the present, and backtracking to tell another character's point of view. I'm all for creative storytelling but I think that particular device has been overused lately. Not everything about the plot is plausible, so there was a little more belief-stretching than I like to have to use in a non SF/Fantasy book. And, of course, lots of wartime angst and misery, although it's handled with a fairly light hand (more older YA level than adult).On the other hand, it's got some really intriguing twists in the plot and a lot of unexpected depth, and some great writing. It's well worth your time; just don't read it when you want something light and fun. There's humor and joy in it, but also great pain. It moved me, and it will stick with me.Initial post: I just finished this story of two friends, a British woman and a Scottish one, helping with the WWII effort. I'm a quivering bundle of goo; I don't think I can be objective about this book for a day or two. There were a few slow parts and more pain and angst than I usually like in my fiction, but some really wonderful parts to it as well.

Maddie and her best friend Queenie (\u201cVerity\u201d) are a sensational team, a pair of unlikely best friends. One: an English commoner, a pilot for the ATA (Air Transport Auxiliary) with a passion for flying and a penchant for mechanics. Two: a Scottish aristocrat, a spy with a way with words, working with the SOE (Special Operations Executive). Both: doing their part for the British War Effort.No. No, no, no. Wait a minute. I am doing this wrong. Let me start again.It starts with a confession: \u201cI AM A COWARD\u201d. And it comes from a female spy captured by the Gestapo in France. Under torture, she caved in and spat out codes and airfields locations. She will do anything, anything to avoid being interrogated again by SS von Linden and this means coughing up everything she knows about the British War Effort. But her story starts with Maddie, the pilot who brought her here and in telling Maddie\u2019 story \u2013 and eventually her own \u2013 she hopes to buy a few more weeks of life. Any life is better than no life even if she knows she will be killed in the end. She does it for clothes \u2013 of all things \u2013 and because she can\u2019t cope. She is the worst of all people in time of war: a collaborator.Her story mixes first person and third person narratives. The first comes with the immediate horror, the guilt, the fear, the trapped-in -a\u2013cell-with-her-torturers-observing-her, no food, no sleep, her ankles tightly bound to the chair, an iron rail tied against her spine and the certainty that her best friend is dead and soon so will she be.The latter is her best friend\u2019s Maddie\u2019s story and how she became a pilot with the ATA, how they met, how they became friends and everything about their friendship including who they met and how they became part of the War Effort which involve some of the secrets the Nazis are not supposed to know.And so, the Scottish spy tells the truth.If I were writing this review on paper it would be smeared all over because of my tears. I haven\u2019t stopped crying since I finished reading this book a few hours ago.This is an amazing story and it feels like it was written especially for me. It features so many of my favourite things: it is an epistolary novel and I love them. I also happen to love books with unreliable narrators and there is always a degree of unreliability when it comes to the narrator of an epistolary novel but a spy narrating a story under duress? That has got to be the most elemental of unreliable narrators and as such, how much of her confession is really the truth?All of it? Parts of it? None of it?When she describes her torture, her bruises, her broken heart, her fear and her guilt, I believe she is telling the truth with all my heart. I believe her and I understand her. I expect I would crumble under torture and no one can ever convince me that a person who caves in under torture is a spineless coward. On the other side of the spectrum, I don\u2019t want her to be telling the truth either. Such a bright, effusive, clever young woman, hand-picked to be a spy? I want her to be brave \u2013 like the French girl next door to her who is tortured every single day and hasn\u2019t said a word. Most of all, I just really want her to be cleverer than the horrible people interrogating her. But how much of that is an impossible expectation based on unfair standards? This is a great source of conflict and this book offers a great opportunity for an examination of bravery, cowardice and patriotism. How impacting is this line? \u201cThe warmth and dignity of my flannel skirt and woolly jumper are worth far more to me now than patriotism or integrity.\u201dOn top of this, this is also a book about writing (because Verity is in effect writing a novel when she is writing her confession), about the love for reading, about the Second World War, the roles women could play at the time and also: PERIL, SUSPENCE AND SPIES!! It is all SO CLEVER, it actually reminded me of Megan Whalen Turner\u2019s Queen Thief\u2019s books. That is all I am going to say on the subject because saying more is to spoil the story and this to me, would be unforgivable.Above all though, Code Name Verity is about its two main characters, two incredible women (I LOVE them. I.LOVE.THEM) and the friendship they had \u2013 they are indeed sensational and I wish I could tell you how or why but I can\u2019t really tell you more about Verity without stealing her thunder. This too, would be unforgivable. It also features one of the best lines about friendship I have ever read, a line that is so simple and so spot on and so true when it came to these two characters, it made me start crying from that moment on: \u201cIt\u2019s like being in love, discovering your best friend.\u201dIsn\u2019t it just?Granted that there was a degree of suspension of disbelief required: I mean, would the Gestapo be so patient with the manner that \u201cVerity\u201d has chosen to write her confession? At times, I also felt the language was perhaps too modern\u2026Do I really care about those? No, I don\u2019t. When a story is this good, the characters so vivid you wish they were real people, the writing so gripping you feel like your heart is being torn out of your chest? That\u2019s the stuff that reminds me how wonderful reading can be.Code Name Verity is a sensational book. Hands down my favourite read so far this year and already on my top 10 of 2012.One last thing: I feel I need to pass on the kind advice I received before I started reading it. If you decide to read this book, keep a box of tissues at hand. There will be tears, and they will be sad ones.

Perhaps it is the difference in experiences that divide me and them - I grew up in a country where the war has left a definite mark, and where people still remember it and mourn its victims. You can still find old houses with bullet holes, and every other street has a memorial plague remembering dozens of underground resistance and innocent civilians slaughtered by the Nazis. People leave flowers and candles under these signs; the memory is very much still with us and quite probably will never leave.What can literature tell us about the war which hasn't already been said? Do we need novels about it when there is an abundance of historical accounts, both written and visual? Perhaps I am being unfairly harsh towards novels such as Code Name Verity - after all, it is only a story. I've enjoyed stories set during the war, and written by those who haven't experienced it - such as David Benioff's excellent City of Thieves, which is about two Russian boys who had to perform an impossible task, set during the siege of Leningrad. I thought that it was a rip-roaring yarn, which mixed comedy with drama brilliantly, and while it's obviously fiction it respected both the setting and the events described. So, why was I disappointed in Verity? Perhaps because it's not really a novel about the war; in the afterword, the author admits that the novel started as a portrait of an Air Transport Auxiliary pilot, and that since she is also a pilot she wanted to explore the possibilities that would be open for her during the period. There is a major focus on aviation in this book: technical details of the planes, details of a pilot's job, etc. As much as I tried to care, I could only take a little of this trivia before beginning to lose my interest.Then there's the story itself, which concerns two female friends who both serve in the British army: one is a pilot, and the other is a spy. The novel begins with a believable situation: the plane carrying the spy crashes in occupied France, and she is soon captured by the Germans. What follows up, however, quickly becomes unbelievable - essentially, the spy is allowed to write her memoirs as a form of confession to the Nazis, and is allowed to indulge in her personal stories. This Nazi captain is presented as a sophisticated lover of literature (with a touch of cold indifference for the fates of his prisoners thrown in), who allows our spy to essentially write a novel about herself with just a few relevant facts thrown in - she does a pretty good job at keeping a scornful and feisty tone for someone who is supposed to be suffering from direct and indirect torture on a daily basis. The spy also essentially admits to be a con artist and pretend to remember in her notes, which somehow doesn't bother the morally ambiguous villain. The whole plot is staged for the final \"twist\", but by that time I was so disinterested in both the story and its characters that I long stopped to care.There are a few interesting bits here - a scene where a German pilot who has accidentally crossed the channel is tricked by the British to believe that he's still in occupied France, and convinced to land in their base is suspenseful and well-written. But I simply never bought into the whole rest of the story, which was just too made up to allow me suspend my disbelief. Instead of reading about two fictional English girls and their adventures in aviation during the war, I'd recommend potential readers to read about the Night Witches - an actual, all female regime of the Soviet Air Forces. These women developed a technique of descending low and turning off their engines and silently gliding towards the drop point, with only wind noises to give them away. The Germans nicknamed them \"Night Witches\" because they likened the noises to the sound made by broomsticks; due to the weight of the bomb and low altitude, the pilots carried no parachutes. This is an actual, true story worth reading about, and perhaps one day someone will turn it into believable fiction."}, {"userName": "B the BookAddict", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19832827-b-the-bookaddict", "userReview": "There have been a couple of negative reviews which have made me want to stab myself in the eyes in frustration.

My most detested of all genres... But I enjoyed it! Just didn't LOVE it like so many others seem to have done.The story is written (or told in this case) by two best friends set in World War 2. The first part of the novel is written by Queenie who is a prisoner of war, caught in France by the gestapo. She is made to write an account of why she is in German occupied France, and of her friendship with Maddie, who was flying the plane that brought her into France. The second part of the book is Maddie's version of events. The first part of the novel written by Queenie is obviously written under duress, and although entertaining, it is not till the second part that it all comes together and the whole truth is revealed.It was a good book. Extremely well written. The characters were written flawlessly and the research that must have gone into this, especially the planes and navigation parts, was amazingly thorough!The audio version itself was impressive. The beautiful Scottish accent of the first narrator was wonderful. I really enjoyed the audio version. I don't think if i read the written version of this book, i would have enjoyed it quite so much. I enjoyed the audio version because I could do other things. Unfortunately I am yet to master housework and reading at the same time so this allows me to do just that. Its funny, when I read a book I can't remember much about where I was when I read it. With this audio version I can remember the EXACT moment of the most pivotal shocking moment of the book - I was unloading the dishwasher and nearly dropped a plate!I really enjoyed how the story came together with the second narrator. Everything started to make more sense and it was extremely interesting. Overall though there were quite a few slower parts but then something really interesting would happen to peak my interest again.It took me a while to get used to listening to a book being read for me. I haven't been read to since I was a child so it was a bit difficult for me to stick with it at first. But as the story started to flow I was all in.I would have liked a little bit of romance. I saw potential there, just to throw a bit in, but nothing really happened. I understand though it was hardly a romantic setting!Overall I really enjoyed it. However I as I said, I didn't LOVE it.

Now, if you need me I will be the crying mess in the corner that is cursing Hollywood that this hasn't been filmed yet.Old ReviewThere is something lacking in war stories that make it to television. We have great battle epics, such as appear on HBO, and we have the rescue stories that appear everywhere. Understandably the battle epics focus on men; what women appear are wives, girlfriends, mothers, nurses, victims. The rescue stories tend to focus more on women rescuers, possibly to make up for the lack of women in the battle stories. I don\u2019t know. And this is true even when the film is not about WW II. Look at Birdsong, War Horse, Cold Mountain. Yet, women did fight in most, if not all, of the wars. Whether it was as last line of defense, disguised as a man, as spies, in factories, as couriers, as pilots, tank drivers, or snipers; women were fighting in battle long before Congress debated whether or not it should be allowed.I\u2019m not sure why this gets ignored. Perhaps because the unknown stories outweigh the known ones. Perhaps because it disrupts our view of motherhood. Perhaps because being a wireless operator is less glorious than being a fighter pilot. Maybe because the women didn\u2019t want to talk about it. But it\u2019s been known for awhile. Shoot, The Longest Day has a woman Resistance member.Another thing that gets downplayed or ignored is female friendship, which always takes second seat to a romance or, more often, fighting over a man. One woman is always superior, better, than the other.So it is refreshing to read something like this book.I swear if this book doesn\u2019t win some award, I\u2019ll thump someone. I\u2019ll break legs. I\u2019ll hunt awards committees down. I\u2019m tired of watching good authors get passed over for stupid reasons.Now the bookstores will tell you this book is Young Adult. That is a lie. It is a historical novel for anyone (though parents should be warned there is torture). The book relates the experiences of Maddie and Queenie, two young women who joined various British divisions, Aircraft Aux and SOE, during WW II. It starts with Queenie writing as she is imprisoned in occupied France. She has been picked up because she looked the wrong way when crossing the street. The book is told, largely, though first person (the narrative does switch, but the voices are so different), and is a book about friendship as well as a person\u2019s ability to do. The focus is mainly on women, though the men are not depicted as evil or misogynistic. It is such a layered and tight book, and I can\u2019t say why because I don\u2019t want to spoil it. If you are looking for a war torn romance, this isn\u2019t it (a romance is hinted at). But this book. This is a great book. From the first sentence, you are brought in. The characters, in particular Maddie and Queenie, are so real. It is like they are there before. The novel is also, in some ways, a rebuke to those stupid cat fighting television shows because the women help themselves here. Just read it. Okay.P.S. I\u2019ve looked over the negative reviews, and some people do have a point. I will say, however, what they complain about is explained in the second half of the book (and Queenie is tortured for a variety of reasons even as she is writing, though this might have been corrected post ARC)."}, {"userName": "Chris Horsefield", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14058695-chris-horsefield", "userReview": "Elizabeth Wein has, with consummate skill, written a powerful story about two girls from vastly different social backgrounds who, at the start of World War II are thrown together and quickly became firm friends. Maddie is a working-class girl from Stockport whilst Julie's ancestry goes back to a certain William Wallace who defeated an English army at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297.Maddie is a WAAF radio operator who, because she'd learnt to fly in 1938, soon finds herself transferred to the Air Transport Auxiliary as a ferry pilot whilst Julie, who speaks fluent French and German, is seconded into the Special Operations Executive. Sometime later, with Maddie wrestling with the controls of flak-damaged Lysander, Julie - no, I am not Scottie, Queenie or Lady Julia Lindsay MacKenzie Wallace Beaufort-Stuart; I am simply Julie - parachutes into occupied France.Captured and tortured by the Gestapo - thanks to a snafu before take-off Julie finds herself carrying Maddie's logbook and ATA papers - she becomes a modern day Scheherazade, forced to write a believable report of the organisation, defences and activities of the RAF.A consummate actress with a powerful imagination her manuscript - you're reading her thoughts and her words as she writes them - skillfully merges fact with fiction, embellishing what the Gestapo already know and what they can probably check. As a result their decision whether to have her shot, guillotined, sent to a concentration camp or simply used for medical experiments is, time and time again, delayed.Does Julie survive her interrogation and torture at the Gestapo headquarters in Ormaie? Does Maddie survive the crash? Do either of the girls get back to the UK?Fly the plane, Maddie...As you read Julie's manuscript you'll undoubtedly notice that several phrases and sentences are underlined: this isn't an editorial oversight and they play a critical role in the finale - a finale which is best summed up by the proverb \"Revenge is a dish best served cold\". Perhaps prophetically those words first appeared almost 100 years earlier, in the French novel 'Mathilde' by Marie Joseph Eug\u00e8ne Sue.And, as SS-Hauptsturmfuher Amadeus von Linden and his colleagues quickly discover, the French maquis are very skilful in ensuring that 'La vengeance se mange tr\u00e8s-bien froide'.Fly the plane, Maddie..."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley", "userReview": "I was about ten minutes away from sobbing ugly sobs in a Whole Foods.

This book was really good but I was very sad after finishing it.I mean, if you're prone to crying at fiction (like I am), just know this book will probably get you.What's great about this book is it's not just about one thing. At the heart of it, it's about female friendship, but it's also an adventure story. A spy story. A war story. It's a thriller, and it's historical fiction. It's a story about women pilots. And it's a story about what it's like to live in an occupied country during wartime, and a story of what it's like to be a prisoner of war. It's also got a little bit of experimental style going on, and it's very, very smart (perhaps too smart for its own good).I say it's maybe too smart for its own good because a lot of the members of my book club had a hard time understanding what was going on because they weren't used to tricksy books. I had no trouble with it, but I did have a bit of an issue getting super engaged until about a third of the way through, at which point it became riveting.But, this book isn't straightforward, and you should know that. This book is one that you should absolutely stick out if you're wanting to give up on it. It's one of those books where the payoff makes up for everything.This book has been reviewed to death and is nearly universally liked, so I was pretty confident I would like it, too.

Wein4.25/5 Stars!Before my real review starts I want to come clean: I have an teeny tiny obsession with basically everything that are related to WWII.What went through in my head while I was reading this book:1) Historical \u27052) Strong women \u27053) Platonic female friendship \u27054) Great plot \u27055) Heartbreaking \u2705\u2705Now the real review:Why I love WWII or anything historical is because they are real, they happened in real life and all of them are based on true stories, and that's why it makes the reader (me) very emotional. I adored Verity and her fearlessness and everything about her.The story is divided in two halves: Part I is narrated by an English spy called Verity (her code name) and Part II is narrated by a pilot called Kittyhawk (also her code name). The book reminded me a lot of the film Female Agents which I really liked.However the writing style need full attention, it was written beautifully and sophisticatedly unlike most of YA genres the book is definitely not meant for young readers.The historical details ans aspects in Code Name Verity fully convinced me, but the novel centered more on the friendship between Maddie and Verity. Both women are very sympathetic, charming, corageous characters that you quickly fall for them, which only increases the tension of the novel.Of course, there are also some minor characters in CODE NAME VERITY, which also convinced me. Verity's brother Jamie was important to the plot too, and members of the Resistance are also highlighted, but the main focus was on Verity and Maddie. I liked seeing Jamie and Verity again after how they were in The Pearl Thief in which they were young teenagers.This book made me so much emotional than it was intended. It's an amazing detailed historical novel with a strong focus on the characters and in addition, while reading this novel, I had the feeling that it was not only about the horrors of the Nazi era, which had been dealt with so often in literary terms, but more generally on the characters and about the horror of war, the oppression that sadly still continues today.Highly recommended!"}], "description": "Oct. 11th, 1943 - A British spy plane crashes in Nazi-occupied France. Its pilot and passenger are best friends. One of the girls has a chance at survival. The other has lost the game before it's barely begun.

Her Nazi interrogators give her a simple choice: reveal her mission or face a grisly execution. As she intricately weaves her confession, Verity uncovers her past, how she became friends with the pilot Maddie, and why she left Maddie in the wrecked fuselage of their plane.
