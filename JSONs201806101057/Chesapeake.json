A friend told her she should read this book. She's moved on to Denver, but we had a recent conversation about Baltimore, which is where I still reside. I posed the same question, and she gave me the answer that had been given to hear, \"You should read \"Chesapeake.\"\" Michener, I'm told by this friend, is a famed histo-geographical fictionalist, which is to say he writes stories that span centuries in a way in which a geographic location is just as important as the characters who cross it over time. In \"Chesapeake,\" we're taken from the prehistoric Native American days up to the race riots of the 1970s. From what I gather thus far, the novel will focus on Chesapeake Bay life, mainly in Maryland and specifically on the Choptank River, one of the estuary's tributories.I'm told that even though the characters are fictional, the timing and major points are historically accurate. Given this, my friend felt it does a indeed do a good job explaining why Baltimore, if the region, have turned out as they have.** Update **I've finished the book and I can't help wonder if I've done so in record time. It's indeed a labor of love- over 800 pages of details about detail. Michener leaves nothing to imagination as he attempts to intimitely describe everything from nautical industry to religion. If you enjoy this level of detail, as well as history, then this book would be perfect for you.As a history buff, I loved it. The details were a little overwhelming. I also found that as the story moved into the 20th century, it tended to become a little less interesting. This, perhaps, is a reflection of my own interest in history; I tend to prefer learning about pre-20th century American history. Indeed, I learned more about Baltimore, Maryland, Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay, of course, and even the Caribbean. That being said, I'm not exactly sure the book does a good job of describing why Baltimore is sort of crazy, but I'm glad she recommended it nonetheless.When I have more time, I'd actually like to read another Michener novel, \"Caribbean.\""}, {"userName": "Betty", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12296939-betty", "userReview": "This has to be one of the best books I have ever read.

It's like asking 'what was Shakespeare's masterpiece?' or even 'what's your favourite Baskin & Robbins flavour ice-cream'? To me, based on the books I have read so far, it is a toss-up between Alaska, Hawaii and this marvellous page-turner, Chesapeake. I'll admit I really had doubts that a story which was limited to the history and area surrounding Chesapeake Bay would hold me for the 700 + pages in which Michener likes to let his narrative flow.But my fears were soon dispelled. Within each Michener book, you soon learn, there are so many great mini-stories and tales of various peoples and their struggles and this is no exception. Herein, there are fascinating stories about local native American tribes who lived in the area (vaguely remember some great story about a guy and his coat of feathers....) as well as the white explorers who came to settle here later. This all goes to show that not only was Michener a great writer and storyteller but he must have been a fantastic researcher as well in order to uncover this much detail. Personally, my favourite parts of the book were the stories about the African-American slaves (can't remember their names as I read this about 7 years ago) who ended up being freed by their master. My mother had always raved about this book when I was growing up. Now I know why. Cannot recommend this book highly enough. Michener is the man."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1528837-katie", "userReview": "There is no better way to make history digestible than by telling the story through fictional characters...dynasties, really. This was really a beautiful and telling account of American history, from the days of Native Americans to the tragedy of Watergate. The scope of the story is magnificent - from exploration, to taming the land, to revolutions, to pirates, to civil rights. One of the things that struck me was how dramatic of a change occurred between about 1890 to 1930. I was sort of disappointed in the lack of transition on Michener's part, but then I realized how dramatic the change really was during those years. There was no transition then either...things changed so quickly. This was really an insightful and pleasurable account of American history from the point of view of Marylanders on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Being on the border of the Mason-Dixon line, this is a perfect position to describe the mentalities of both Northerners and Southerners. Furthermore, the beautiful setting makes you appreciate the vast array of natural beauty that America provides. Really a great story."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3739451-suzanne", "userReview": "James Michener has a remarkable talent for introducing a setting and taking his readers on a journey, that will make one understand the area through it's history and it's people. In Chesapeake, he forms a novel around that area in Maryland that borders the Choptank River, a tributary of Chesapeake Bay.Michener begins with the natives just prior to settlement by colonial English. Through native (and later colonial) eyes, the reader gets a good feel for the bounty available in this area. He describes a beautiful natural setting with fish and fowl, berries and trees - everything capable of sustaining life. His descriptions of the land make it a valuable treasure to his characters and his readers, and this is even more poignant in later chapters of the book, when environmental concerns come into play.Like all Michener books, there is so much history here. From 16th century Native American tribes, to immigrants arriving from across a vast ocean, we learn how each affects the land and how the land affects them. I was fascinated to learn how the different religious sects arrived to find persecution in this new land. We are always told that early settlers came to flee religious persecution, but in Chesapeake, early Quakers were flogged, stripped and sometimes chased naked out of various colonies.Slavery and the racist attitudes that survive it's demise, also play a big role in this 1,000 + page novel. I enjoyed the stories of the African Cudjo, how he led the mutiny of his slave ship, and how he eventually became free. Michener did a good job of portraying those who profited, either directly or indirectly, from the slave trade. Their struggle with conscience versus the uncertainty of economic livelihood was well presented. And the feisty Quaker matriarch, who knew, without a doubt, that slavery was an evil that must be abolished, was a wonderful balance to the slaves and those that allowed slavery to continue.Michener also used anthropomorphism to make the world of geese and crabs come alive in a way that helped the reader to understand the changes taking place in nature. I greatly appreciated this much more than the straightforward approach he used in other novels.Another story line near the end included the Watergate crimes. Since this novel was first published in 1978, Michener, like all of us during that time, were surrounded by news of the break-in and subsequent hearings. With little choice in television or radio, Watergate was on every channel all the time. You couldn't get away from it. And so I appreciated even more, Michener's including it in the book. Somehow, it seemed right because it would have been a big part of the history of this area, especially given it's proximity to the nation's capital.I have to yet to read a Michener novel that I didn't enjoy, and Chesapeake definitely rises to the top of those I have read. Fabulous book!"}, {"userName": "Benny", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1965747-benny", "userReview": "I loved this book.

By covering the historical period from 1583 to 1978, the author describes many historical facts and plenty of main characters, showing how the founders of 4 families will dominate the main plot: the Steeds, the Paxmores, the Caters and the Turlocks. Some strong and remarkable female characters play important roles into the plot.The book is divided in 18 chapters, each one beginning with a voyage that will provide the foundation for the chapter plot and will describe a particular generation of people.Some geographical points, such as Devon Island and the town of Patamoke , are fictional. There is an interesting link, Talbot County, which suggests an itinerary for this book.The author also describes a large variety of central themes, such as religion, slavery, poverty, industry and politics, including the American Revolution, the Civil War, the Emancipation and the Watergate scandal.Some typical wildlife animals are also described, starting with the deer, the Canadian Honker geese, the oysters and crabs as well.A magnificent book and an unforgettable saga that certainly will captivate many readers.

Michener tells the American story through the lives of the members of these families. Collectively it is a story of success and failure, loyalty and betrayal, faith and denial all mixed with hard work, war, and life in and around the waters of he Chesapeake. It tackles some of the hardest issues that Americans have experienced since its earliest days including religious tolerance, slavery, immigration, etc. and highlights the changes of living, of loving, of working, and of worshipping in this area.

It's an amazing vacation -- eating crabs, watching sunsets and the fury of storms blowing down the James River. We usually arrive from Boston by driving down the Eastern Shore or DelMarVa peninsula. It always seems so isolated to me. A region out of time and just barely connected to the mainland of the US. This book, which I begun during what will in all likelihood be our last trip down, was a wide, sweeping look at the Chesapeake in a way I've never been able to grasp it in all of the time I've spent there.This book was an epic -- in all of the best senses of that word. Nearly 835 pages, it took me a good 3 weeks to finish. And I don't know that I could have read it that quickly if I weren't on vacation for two of the weeks! Epic though also in that amazing rush through stories of generations that modern writers seem to have abandoned. It was almost a pleasure to read a book, so clearly written in another time, that was grounded so solidly in plot and characters and most importantly in place. We were little burdened by the inner soul-searching that so many current writers feel we need to wade through.Sometimes.

While the story began well, eventually it really did begin to ramble but also it skipped major moments in history (the Civil War is mentioned as an afterthought and the Civil Rights movement is mentioned as a peripheral occurrence). These lapses in historical moments are an interesting choice, considering the nearly insignificant details that are included. At one point I continued reading simply because I had put so much time into the book, it would feel like a time wasting failure to not finish.So basically, I would rate the first half of the book higher because the character and plot development was well done and enjoyable. I cared about what was happening and could see how things were developing. The second half I would give a lower rating because it felt like Michener had pretty much given up on any meaningful development and just wanted to get to a certain page count. The stories became dull and very surface.I haven't been turned off of Michener, but it will probably be a while before I decide to invest the time into another of his books."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6787827-linda", "userReview": "1.99 on 04/03/17This will be my first by James A.

I am always impressed, if not amazed, by his depth of knowledge concerning the topography, people, and in-depth history of the areas about which he writes. This book was no exception. The book unfolds in voyages, fourteen in all, and takes us across an amazing four centuries. It begins with the native tribes living in the Choptank area of the country in the 16th century, and moves across time as colonists embark from Europe. Amazingly, he tracks three families across all this time: the Turlocks--a group of muskrat like people who inhabit the swamps; the Steeds, from English ancestry who become very rich and noble like; and the Paxmores--Quakers who build ships and stand, steadfast as the masts of their ships, to their Quaker faith. The story is a powerful one because I found myself becoming attached through familiarity with the families. As with any relations, I did not always care for each equally, but that is normal, I believe. This is not a piece of classic literature in the way that one thinks of A Tale of Two Cities, for example. But it maintains its own kind of majesty that tracks a segment of Americana in a most memorable way. The memories are sometimes painful: slavery, the mistreatment of the Native American peoples; the debauchery and pollution of the pristine area, the land, and the waterways. I particularly loved the way the author makes connections between men and nature. Near the end of the novel, one of the characters, a Steed, is a retired gentleman 65 years old. The author writes that the force of the earth, revolving in its passage through space, ought to carry an older man along, from year to year, making such honors as he may have earned seem even more delectable because of his reunion with primal agencies. I like to believe that, when I am 65 in five years, I will feel that same way, and be carried along by the stream of time and nature in which I make my passage. This is a powerful book, but because it accurately reflects the many avarices of the human species, one will not find it either easy or painless to read. I loved it, but am picking up something a little lighter, both figuratively and literally, for my next read."}, {"userName": "Manu", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu", "userReview": "From 1583 to 1978 the saga moves, tracking the lives of individuals, their families, the society they live in, and most importantly the place where all of this happens. Chesapeake is as much about a way of life, as it is about the place and its people. The book is typical Michener, and uses individual stories across generations to show the way a place and its society has evolved. Even as each generation's story is read, it is difficult to realise the passage of time, since sometimes the changes are too subtle to be noticed. As many of the place's characteristics remain unchanged, despite human efforts, it becomes easier to acknowledge the transience of man, and the things he builds, not just boats, buildings etc, but even the constructs of the society he lives in. The book captures the plight of the Indians who were the original inhabitants of the area, the arrival of the first conquerors, the American war of Independence, the slave trade, the American Civil War, world War 2, Watergate, some of them in the foreground, and some in the background, as the fortunes of individuals and families rise and fall.

I mention the time factor because it sits in that genre of massive 'blockbusters'(alongside 'War And Peace') - the size of a brick and unputdownable !In this masterpiece, James A. Michener encapsulates almost the entire history of America within the microcosm of the Chesapeake Bay area, with its ancient abundance of fish, herons and geese. From the time when the native Indians first saw the 'Great Canoe'of the first settlers (who, as pilgrims, farmers, hunters, slaves, merchants and watermen came over the next four centuries) - to the late 1970's, this mammoth novel reflects all the diversity, excitement, violence and charisma of burgeoning American society - seen, especially, through the turbulent stories of four imaginary families with their lives, deaths, triumphs, disasters, happiness and hell.

Michener takes a god's eye view of the region, beginning with John Smith and the Indians, and unrolls the history through the generations of 4 families--plantation owners, Quakers, low-life \"watermen\", and African American. There are cameo appearances from George Washington and other worthies, incursions by pirates, chapters on boat building--even a crab cake recipe, and a little drama with(anthropomorphic) wild goose hero. The most compelling thread for me was the story of slavery in this battleground region, told through the generations, with the very gradual development of moral consciousness. It was actually pretty nuanced,and made me really want to find out more. This isn't really a novel at all, since the characters are merely illustrative of types.

What a bad bargain we've made here.\" That seems to be an underlying theme of much of James A Michener's work. The last chapter in a Michener book, Chesapeake is no exception, is some sort of clash of descendants that has been building up since the first chapter (in some cases, since the earth began): in Poland, it's the clash between the Poles and the Russians; in The Covenant it's the clash between defenders of apartheid and the heroes who fought against it. Chesapeake and Centennial have very similar clashes, protectors of the environment and exploiters of the environment (among others: in Chesapeake, Watergate is almost a character in this last chapter, which is strangely compelling and also weirdly told; I guess in 1978 Watergate was fresh in everyone's mind, and even Michener was writing about it). He is always bringing all of these disparate forces and folks he's loving detailed for 1,000 pages together in these last pages for some sort of Michnerian g\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung - although the world never completely burns down.

The book is simply too long. Broken up into 14 \"Voyages\", the book could have been chunked into shorter novels, each focusing on a time period. The reason why this book earned a third star, in my view, is because of the tireless effort and research it must've taken to study the history of the Chesapeake Bay region, and then to write a fiction story, intertwining fiction with history and real characters like Washington, Franklin, Calhoun, and even Hitler.

It would be interesting to read Michener's view on the last 30 years. Michnener is sparse on dialog and fond of using words that even the college prep courses haven't discovered. If you decide to take this journey, and it is a long one (800+ pages), don't expect high drama and page-turning action and suspense. Prepare yourself for lengthy descriptions of Indians and Europeans exploring the bay and the rivers that feed it. Action, including several accounts of pirates, is described in detail. The saga is compelling but the writing is more akin to narrative history than fiction because of its sterile, seemingly unbiased accounts of the characters.As a fan of the Chesapeake, it was lovely to read the detailed descriptions of rivers, oysters, crabs, marshes, geese and heron. Michener captured many of the unique elements of the bay--the brackish waters, the Skipjack, Chesapeake retreivers, tomatoe canneries, and lots of corn.The fictive movments when his characters interacted with historical figures were entertaining--such as one of the Steeds playing cards with George Washington. Michener adds relevancy by weaving into the plot such moments as well as historical events like the civil rights movement and Watergate. While suspense is not Michener's forte, his language skills are beyond reproach. He has penned timelines one liners among the vast descriptions. One of my favorites is on page 278 and it ends a paragraph wherein Roselind is describing how she will landscape Devon Island. \"My principal flowers will be trees. Because when you plant trees, you're entitled to believe you'll live forever.\"The pragmatic knowledge, ingenuity and rebellousness of the Turlock clan is also laughable and admirable at times. At one point a sailing yacht has run aground in the soft mud of the Choptank. The yacht clearly outweighs the Turlock's skipjack, but Amos (I believe) brokers a deal for $50 dollar so free the boat. Knowing that he cannot tow it free, he ties a line to the yacht's mast at least half way up and begins to make it heal. When the mast is almost parallel to the water and the keel is unstuck, the tide bouyes the boat and it float free. The owner complains that $50 is a lot of money for 6 minues work. To which Amos replies something like, \"$5 for doing, $45 for know how.\"If you have the time and want to learn more about the Chesapeake and enjoy historical fiction, this novel is worthy of your time."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7175349-david", "userReview": "Interesting that Goodreads does not offer me the option of rating this book. Wonder what that is about? Anyway, this book is nearly 1,100 pages long, so don't bother to read my review, because you are never going to read this book (unless of course you live on the Chesapeake Bay, in which case you have probably already read it, and therefore have even less reason to read my review). I can hardly believe I read it myself, but I did, apparently out of sheer stubbornness.When I was a youngster, probably in my early teens, I read Michener's Hawaii, and loved it. For those who have not read it, as I recall, it starts with the islands being born from volcanos and just keeps going. I don't think I read anything else by him since then, and I am not sure what prompted me, but somehow I got it into my head that I should read the one about the Chesapeake, having grown up so near to that great waterway.Turns out to be quite a book, as I guess one might hope from something that long. The author invents a little corner of the Eastern Shore (so he tells us in the preface), and populates it with invented settlers, so he can follow their families through four centuries. There are Native Americans (at least at first), Catholics, Quakers, pirates, Africans, slaves, the Irish escaping the potato famine, and a chapter that tells the story of a family of geese. The whole saga eventually winding up with Watergate and its aftermath, which makes sense for a book that was published in 1978. Through it all comes an appreciation for wetlands and marshes (lots of natural history along the way), and at the very end we see the environmental movement come to life, which is a nice touch (we also see why it was so needed). To the extent that it is a love-letter to the place, it is wonderful and charming. And if you like a long historical saga, with lots of intense drama and humanity, and can make allowances for when this was written and by whom, you might enjoy the read. But unless you are a confirmed Michener fan, I suggest you proceed with caution."}, {"userName": "Poiema", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1524767-poiema", "userReview": "In his fictional history of Chesapeake Bay, James Michener takes you to the top of a large building and lets you watch the pageant of centuries pass like a parade beneath your gaze. Though you can see the details of individuals as they pass, your perspective predisposes you to see the broad sweep of centuries. It is an amazing amalgam of crooks and colonels, priests and pirates, fishermen and floozies, merchants and mechanics with the natural history of Chesapeake Bay providing the backdrop for it all.I am amazed by the extensive research and detail contained in this epic work (1,083 pages!), yet never do the facts present themselves overtly. Always, they are packaged as part of the intricate web of life woven within the history of three founding families. Their diverse backgrounds and idiosyncracies are destined to intertwine as the generations unfold and the telling is a treat for all armchair adventurers. I closed the book with a profound sense of awe; Michener brought forth a vivid sense of understanding that individuals are both the product of those who have preceded them and the predictor of what lies ahead. Each person occupies only a small and fleeting role in history, but one life can color the entire sweep of a generation. What if the first English settler had taken the lovely Indian princess as bride, instead of waiting for his proper English wife to arrive by boat some years later? How would the Quaker family line have been affected if the patriarch had capitulated to the pressure to build boats for the purpose of slave trading?Momentous decisions face every generation, but seldom are the players cognizant of the truth that their decisions are not trivial---they deeply affect posterity. I'm encouraged by my glimpse into the Chesapeake saga because it is ultimately an affirmation that life matters; and by extension--yes MY life matters, too."}, {"userName": "Lola peterson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6020690-lola-peterson", "userReview": "Hey!

Michener brings his grand epic tradition to bear on the four-hundred-year saga of America\u2019s Eastern Shore, from its Native American roots to the modern age. In the early 1600s, young Edmund Steed is desperate to escape religious persecution in England. After joining Captain John Smith on a harrowing journey across the Atlantic, Steed makes a life for himself in the New World, establishing a remarkable dynasty that parallels the emergence of America. Through the extraordinary tale of one man\u2019s dream, Michener tells intertwining stories of family and national heritage, introducing us along the way to Quakers, pirates, planters, slaves, abolitionists, and notorious politicians, all making their way through American history in the common pursuit of freedom. \u00a0Praise for Chesapeake \u00a0 \u201cAnother of James Michener\u2019s great mines of narrative, character and lore.\u201d\u2014The Wall Street Journal \u00a0 \u201c[A] marvelous panorama of history seen in the lives of symbolic people of the ages . . . an emotionally and intellectually appealing book.\u201d\u2014The Atlanta Journal-Constitution \u00a0 \u201cMichener\u2019s most ambitious work of fiction in theme and scope.\u201d\u2014The Philadelphia Inquirer \u00a0 \u201cMagnificently written . . . one of those rare novels that are enthusiastically passed from friend to friend.\u201d\u2014Associated Press", "title": "Chesapeake", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1212583.Chesapeake", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320514265l/1212583.jpg", "reviews": 693, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7995.James_A_Michener", "name": "James A.
