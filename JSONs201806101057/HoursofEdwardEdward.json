I\u2019m agog at how fortuitous it is that I came to read this book. I\u2019m considering whether any of the characters were flamboyant, austere, tenacious, ostentatious, apoplectic, or exceptional. Through this book, I have discovered that I love the words rambunctiousness, discombobulated, and onomatopoeia, notwithstanding the fact that I struggle to spell the latter, however, that\u2019s no great shakes. I find myself flabbergasted by how much I\u2019m rocking this book, and the thought of not loving it would be truly preposterous.I\u2019m rather confident that Edward, the main character in this book, would like the paragraph above. Edward has Asperger\u2019s Syndrome and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and has to be one of my all-time favourite book characters, which is rather impressive, considering how many books I\u2019ve actually read. This story is endearing, touching, emotional, sad and funny throughout.Edward states \u201cI don\u2019t like to assume. I prefer facts.\u201d I think he would love to meet my grandma, as she taught me from a very young age that to assume makes and \nass\n out of \nu\n and me.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes character led stories, as Edward is such a wonderful and entertaining character.

What\u2019s not to love? From Edward's endearing idiosyncrasies, to the supporting characters that impacted his life, this was an enjoyable read in which I was sad to see end. \u00a0I loved the format of the book, the repetitious rituals that Edward lived by, and the things we came to expect, from the tracking of when he woke to the significance of the Dragnet episodes he watched in the evenings.But mostly I loved the life lessons this book taught me, including accepting others for who they are and adapting to their ways, and not expecting them to conform to ours.\u00a0 It was a realistic and relatable story\u2014for me at least, raising a child with special needs who has some endearing idiosyncrasies of his own\u2014but I think this is a book anyone could enjoy.\u00a0 Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5537205-robert", "userReview": "For the first time in my life, I actually felt like a hypochondriac. And for a day I thought I had Asperger\u2019s syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder, my every movement tracked and accounted for, as my social skills dropped off a precipitous edge, only to return to normal the next day.Edward Stanton rocked 600 HOURS OF EDWARD like Mick Jagger in his prime. His head (and mine) filled with numbers, as we tracked weather patterns, wrote letters of discontent, and consumed spaghetti and Diet Dr. Pepper with reckless abandon.

It was a beautiful feeling, and I\u2019m sorry to say it ended way too soon.But it was Edward\u2019s relationship with his father that stood at the center of this novel, defining both he and his dad with every letter and lawyer intervention. Without it, this story would have been a shell of the novel it could have been, even if the words for both Edward and his father didn\u2019t always come out right, or took on new meaning in the course of one social evening.Since online dating has become the next big thing, there\u2019re even a few amusing bits about what can go right (and then horribly wrong) in the course of one evening.

It is a book that makes you feel good; a book that makes you think about life, yourself and others; a book that makes you reflect.The thing that makes me love the books where the MC suffers from a mental illness, is the absence of filters. They are the realest people. They don't refrain their thoughts or their words, they're always direct and they don't BS you. Never! There are no misunderstandings and no dramas.Edward is a 39 yo man diagnosed as developmentally disabled. He lives alone. He does everything at the same time of the day, everyday. He wakes up, does his daily routine, meets with his therapist once a week, drives his car, does grocery, watches his favorite TV series every night and sleeps every night at the same time. Edward life's chorus can be summarized by four sentences:\n\"I prefer facts.......................................................................Dr. Buckley is a very logical person........................................................................Tonight\u2019s episode of Dragnet is called [..] and it is one of my favorites.......................................................................My data is complete.\nThese are mentioned many times in the book. They never get annoying. Edward doesn't like change. He reads the newspaper everyday, especially the weather section and keeps tabs for the daily predicted temperatures, which he compares to the factual ones the next day.\n\nThe only worthwhile things in life are those that you can rely on. Change brings uncertainty. Change brings chaos. These are things I do not need.\n\nSo when new neighbors move in near him, changes in Edward's life begin to appear and he finds himself questioning his actions and beliefs.Edward is a very complex character, as every character with Asperger Syndrome. He's not a teenager or a young man. He is more mature and his long therapy with his therapist has helped him to deal with his issues and struggles. He is a very logical and reasonable man. Reading about how he sees the world is an amazing experience:\n\nI\u2019ve occasionally heard people say something like \u201cI know his heart,\u201d and I wonder how someone could possibly know such a thing. A heart is a mysterious thing to know. Doctors know how they work, of course, and can sometimes fix them when they\u2019re not working correctly. But the mechanics of the heart are not what people are talking about when they say such things. They are talking about a person\u2019s intentions or nature or goodness.\n\nThere are some heart-breaking moments so very well described. You can feel Edward's pain and his internal battles to deal with it.\n\n\u201cEverybody Hurts\u201d is the perfect song to describe how I am feeling these days. I do feel like I am alone sometimes. But as you rightly point out, I am not alone. I have my mother. And I have a memory of my father that is a happy one.Thank you, Michael Stipe, for writing such perfect songs.\n\nThe writing is exceptional. Every page makes you reflect about life. Being in Edward's mind is an extraordinary thing. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to see the world differently and more colorful."}, {"userName": "Carole (Carole's Random Life in Books)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5892196-carole-carole-s-random-life-in-books", "userReview": "This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life in Books.I liked this one. This book was a bit different from what I would normally pick up. I heard a few good things about it so I took a closer look once I noticed that it was available to borrow from Amazon through Prime Reading. I loved the idea of a main character who is living with Asperger's syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder, so I decided to give it a try and I am really glad that I did.Edward was a great character. I liked him from the start and as the story progressed, I liked him more and more. Edward's life revolves around routines. With few exceptions, each day looks largely like the previous one. Things do shake up his life quite a bit by the end of the book and there is definitely some character growth for Edward during the course of the story. I thought that his character felt very authentic in the way that he dealt with other people and handled his emotions.This book is repetitive because Edward's life is repetitive. There are certain events and phrases that happen over and over throughout the book. Each day of Edward's life would bring a new cycle of the book. I think that the decision to take the reader through each day with Edward helped to really show how much the events in the story changed his life. Edward's life at the end of the book looks very different than it does at the start and it was great to take the journey with him.Luke Daniels does a fantastic job with the narration of this book. One of the reasons that I decided to listen to this book was because I have enjoyed his work in the past. I thought that he was able to bring Edward to life in way that really added to the story. He did a great job with all of the character voices and adding emotion to the reading. I listened to this book for hours at a time and finished it within a few days and thought that he was a perfect match for the story. I would recommend this book to others. I really enjoyed going along with Edward as he navigated the changes and his life and made new connections. I did notice that this book is listed as the first in a series but it tells a very complete story so I am not sure if I will read the other installments. I would not hesitate to read more from Craig Lancaster in the future.Initial ThoughtsThis isn't the kind of book that I pick up often. I noticed this one being offered in the Amazon Prime lending program. I love have enjoyed the narrator's work before so I decided to look closer at the book. When I saw that the main character of this story is living with Asperger's syndrome and OCD, I knew that I had to listen to this one. It was a really good story. It could be repetitive at times but that was just a reflection of Edward's life.

Yep, that\u2019s about the span of days spent in Edward\u2019s life during this story that is sometimes funny, sometimes touching, and all the time likeable. I\u2019m not a fan of the e-reader, but I realized something soon after downloading and beginning 600 Hours of Edward. I looked forward to picking up that Kindle each day, with a book about a man who\u2019s just a little bit different hidden somewhere inside its memory banks. Edward would appreciate that change in % progression and those tiny, digital page numbers lit at the bottom of the screen. They are analytic. They are factual, and that\u2019s what he likes best. Other people? Well, that\u2019s a little harder. They are not so easy to understand. I know Edward, I know. But inside of Edward there is a desire to step outside the routine he\u2019s come to rely upon, sparked by a young boy and his mom who recently moved in across the street.

I have so many emotions about this book, and I really need a few days to process them all before writing a proper review. I will say right now that this was one of the best books I have ever read, and that Edward is by far one of the most endearing characters I have ever been introduced to. *ETA*I am going to keep this short and sweet, since it has been a few weeks since i finished this book and I am still having trouble putting my thoughts into words about it.I find it amazing that Lancaster was so successful in keeping the perfect balance between a sweet and touching story about an isolated man very much facing life as a misunderstood outsider, to a silly comedy about a misfit who lacks the people skills needed to navigate through day to day life. And that in a book of less than 300 pages he was able to get both sides of that man's story across so well.Edward is all about routine. He starts his day by recording the time he opened his eyes and the weather forecast in a notebook he keeps beside the bed. He eats the same food week after week. He watches one episode of Dragnet (only from the last season) at 10pm every night. He writes a daily \"Letter of Complaint\" to people who anger him (a suggestion by his therapist, who also encourages him to never mail the letters but file them away instead) and is in bed each night by 12am. His life is on a continuous loop until his new neighbors arrive across the street. The way that Edward ends up dealing with that curve ball being thrown into his life is both touching and believable. The way the author deals with Edward as a character is also damn close to perfect. His obsessive behavior never comes off as pathetic or makes the reader feel uncomfortable. Instead the author makes us fall in love with this flawed and troubled man in a way that makes his quirks only part of his charm.I am so glad I decided to take a chance on this book, because this was a reading experience that will remain with me for a long time. And Edward is most definitely someone I will never forget."}, {"userName": "Sofia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14453898-sofia", "userReview": "The Triumph of Connection - Connecting any which way possible.Loved reading this.

My hope is that people will become more accepting and understanding as our adults maneuver their way though a society which is often very complicated and irrational to them.I became very emotionally involved in this story and at times I wanted to put Edward in a protective \"bubble\". However, like all other young people, Edward had to experience both the wonderful and the painful aspects of life in order to grow.

Stanton is a marvellous character & the author brings him to life so well you can almost believe you are reading the diary of a real person.There are endless moments to make you smile throughout this story & Edward's interactions with other people are wonderfully told. Some readers may find his repeated entries about the weather & the TV series Dragnet (where he is always watching one of his favourite episodes!) a bit repetitive, but this just underlines his OCD issues.

One is treated with medication and therapy while the other just form parts of who he is. Edward also struggles to let grudges go, to let injustice and the perceived bad behaviour of others go unchecked. To help with this letting go, his therapist suggests that he write letters of grievance to the other parties but with strict instructions NEVER to actually send them. But rather to use this as a way to clear the air in Edwards mind. These letters made for humorous and sometimes poignant reading.  Edward is very much bound and grounded by his routines and data he collects on seemingly absurd things such as what time of the day he wakes up or his obsession with the TV show Dragnet. I found the detailed descriptions of these episodes slightly unnecessary and towards the end started speed reading over these sections.Edward\u2019s relationship with his father (and to an extent his mother as well) just left me sad. It\u2019s clear that they never made a real effort to understand their son\u2019s eccentricities and mental illness. His father felt that setting Edward up in his own home and paying for the bills was where his responsibility ended.If you have read The Rosie Project it will be impossible NOT to compare these two books. I found Don from just a little bit more likable than Edward but both books have their merit and unique feel to them.While Rosie Project is a humorous look at the socially inept Don, with this book I felt a lot more sympathy for Edward\u2019s loneliness and inability to do anything about it. This is not necessarily a fast-paced edge-of-your seat kind of story as a lot of what Edward does is defined by repetitive routines but I was charmed by his story and really enjoyed the reading experience."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3534502-julie", "userReview": "This was a great book! I found myself smiling broadly and even laughing out loud while I read it. The premise of the story was no laughing matter, however. Mental illness is always a tough subject for an author to tackle in a fictional setting. I can't imagine the difficulty they encounter trying to capture and illustrate the issues a mentally ill subject must deal with while at the same time ensuring that the character doesn't come across as \"too crazy\". Mr. Lancaster has done a superb job working through this potential dilemma. Edward Stanton is a likeable, middle aged man who just happens to have a mental illness. He has feelings and thoughts just like any of us. This story focuses on the accomplishments Edward makes, little by little, one step at a time.

The subtle shift in the narrative style, the gradual uncoupling of the prose from its formula as its central character is estranged from the routines that drive his day-to-day existence, is handled brilliantly, almost the perfect marriage of form and content. The \"incidental\" characters - none of them are truly incidental, in truth - burst from the page, wreathed in Edward's descriptions of them and the details we surmise but Edward doesn't quite see.

I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.)As I've said here before, although I'm a big fan and champion of small-press, basement-press and self-published books, after reviewing hundreds of them now I've discovered that such designations are largely a self-regulating system, and that 95 percent of these titles were published under the circumstances they were because they really don't merit mainstream national attention. So it's always worth celebrating, then, when coming across a book from that five percent that legitimately do deserve a lot more acclaim than they're getting; and the latest of these is the remarkable 600 Hours of Edward by veteran journalist but first-time novelist Craig Lancaster, and put out by the tiny Montana-based Riverbend Publishing, a book which could easily be an NYT bestseller right now if put out by HarperCollins and given a million-dollar marketing budget. And that's because Lancaster puts together here a nearly perfect combination of traditional literary elements, mixing crowd-pleasing sappiness with indie-friendly subversion, a masterful blend of character and action that takes advantage of traditional framing devices in just about the best way possible; and all this is even more astounding when you realize that the first draft of this book was the result of Lancaster participating in Nanowrimo, the popular literary challenge held every November where as many people as possible try to write an entire novel from start to finish over the course of exactly one month.As the title indicates, the book is essentially a deep character study regarding 25 days in the life of one Edward Stanton, obsessive letter-writer and sufferer of Asperger Syndrome, the so-called \"genius disease\" that in the last ten years has gone from almost complete obscurity to nearly every nerd on the planet now claiming to be a victim of it, and which I'm convinced that future citizens will one day count as a major historical touchstone of the early 2000s, right up there with Facebook and Prozac. But as Lancaster deftly shows us, when legitimately manifested Asperger's can actually be quite the crippling condition, basically a combination of obsessive-compulsive disorder (or OCD) with a high-functioning version of autism, making its socially challenged victims essentially just a few steps away from being one of those sullen hospital patients who sit in the corner of a room for 16 hours a day muttering to themselves and rocking back and forth. I mean, certainly this is the state that we find the middle-aged Edward in as the novel opens, as Lancaster takes the time at the beginning to show his highly regulated, OCD-dominated life of rituals -- awake at exactly 7:37 every morning, grocery shopping every Thursday at 2 pm, where he buys the exact same list of goods each time, videotaped episodes of \"Dragnet\" at precisely 10:00 every night, but only the color episodes from 1967 to 1970, and which absolutely must be watched in the order they originally aired.Like all good traditional three-act stories, then, the bulk of 600 Hours concerns what happens when a series of special events start disrupting this all-important routine more and more, and the various ways that Edward both successfully and unsuccessfully handles them -- like the arrival of a new neighbor, for example, a harried single mom whose rambunctious nine-year-old son starts hanging out around Edward's place more and more, and whose abusive ex eventually drags Edward into the middle of a court battle that almost puts him into an apoplectic state; or his rapidly deteriorating relationship with his aging father, an infamously curmudgeonly local politician and former oil-industry executive, who has always suspected half of Edward's mentally imbalanced behavior to be a deliberate put-on, and who has started resorting more and more to official missives from his lawyer whenever needing to communicate with him. And indeed, it's in these elements where Lancaster really shines, and is the main point of reading this novel, because of him quickly pushing past all the easy stereotypes of such characters to show us the much deeper, much more complex human beings who lie underneath. But then again, as mentioned, Lancaster also employs a series of traditional framing devices in order to hold the story together, well-known ones to be sure (for example, Edward's weekly visits to his psychiatrist, which occur four times in the book and serve as nice recaps to everything we've just learned), but that never wear out their welcome because of Lancaster always using them with a light touch (or, well, almost always using them with a light touch, which is why this book isn't receiving a perfect score today -- for example, Edward's obsessive recaps of that night's \"Dragnet\" episode at the end of each chapter wear thin by the end, and the whole mini-essay in the middle about the ten greatest Dallas Cowboys games in history was something the book could've done completely without).And yes, as so far described, it'd be easy to dismiss 600 Hours as yet another afterschool special regarding an adorably quirky handicapped hero overcoming the odds and teaching all the people around him a little more about life; and indeed, arts history (especially the history of Oscar-bait Hollywood tearjerkers) is littered with such cutesy, pandering trash, and I'm usually as much of a hater of such crap as you are. (And seriously, Sean Penn, if you play even one more plucky but lovable mentally-challenged person, I may just possibly kill myself out of sheer disgust.) But what saves this book is that Lancaster takes the time and energy to show us the dark sides as well of dealing with someone who suffers from Asperger's, to show us the various ways that such a person will simply fail the people around them in certain situations, no matter how hard they try not to (and in fact, since a notorious trait of Asperger victims is an almost complete lack of social skills, such people many times fail to even understand why they should put in an effort in such situations in the first place); see as a fantastic example Edward's truly cringe-inducing attempt at internet dating, and the poor, poor woman who is subjected to an evening with him without realizing that he is in fact mentally imbalanced. But then again, Lancaster also manages to mine a lot of humor out of such situations too, which helps keep the darkness not too overwhelmingly dark; to stay with this example, see Edward's hilarious complaint letter to the CEO of dating site eHarmony, on how the happy smiling couples seen in their commercials could technically be considered a form of false advertising.Ultimately I can give the book no higher compliment than this -- that it was one of only a handful of titles each year that made me cry in public while reading it (and by \"cry,\" I mean literally weeping, big fat tears running down my cheeks at the coffeehouse like literally a little girl watching freakin' Bambi), an event I always take as a good sign, when a book can emotionally move a cynical bastard like me that much without making me disgusted at myself afterwards. For all you editors and agents who trawl the CCLaP website looking for obscure but proven winners ripe for turning into bigger hits, this is one of those winners, and there's no doubt in my mind that it will remain by the end of the year one of my top-ten favorite reads in the entirety of 2010. It's the very definition of an unknown book you should take a chance on, and I highly encourage you today to do just that.Out of 10: 9.7"}, {"userName": "Gail", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4026928-gail", "userReview": "It does seem there is rather a trend for novels with autistic narrators written by non-autistic authors, and they seem to go along something like this:'I woke up at precisely 7:23am - I knew this from turning my head a 90 degree angle and seeing the digital clock on my bedside table. This is two minutes later than the average time I have woken up so far this year (there have been 233 days so far because it's a leap year). I keep a chart of it, along with the numbers of left turns and right turns I make in every journey, and the estimates I make of the body weight and age of every person I meet, because we autistic people love numbers and applying them to pointless things like this, and mentioning these things on every page will remind you that I'm autistic and that this book is written by a clever author who knows all about autism.'And of course, all us genuine autistic people are reading thinking 'WTF? Is this how the world really thinks we think?'On the other hand, as with The Rosie Project, a lot of the behaviours of this character are actually very realistic and believable. I suspect the author knows some people on the autism spectrum and has observed their behaviour pretty accurately. It's just the inner voice of the character that is so lacking. As if numbers are the main focus of an autistic person's thoughts, rather than merely a strategy to make some sense of the world. There is never any depth of personhood beneath the numbers in these sorts of books. No soul, no complexity, and certainly none of the utterly overwhelming chaos that underlies the numbers (or whatever other strategy an autistic person might use - contrary to what the media would have you believe, we don't all focus on numbers!). Just a simplistic character who is half-child, half-robot. The plot was fairly predictable. It was an okay read. Fairly absorbing. I've no desire to read about any more of Edward's hours though!"}, {"userName": "Heidi Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1631797-heidi-thomas", "userReview": "I have to admit I began reading 600 Hours of Edward with a bit of trepidation. This is fellow Montanan, journalist and friend, Craig Lancaster's first novel and I wanted to like it. But, I wondered, 278 pages about a man with Asperger's syndrome who obsessively-compulsively records the exact minute he awakes each morning? Someone who eats the same thing for lunch every day, drives to the grocery store every Tuesday, and makes only right-hand turns?Well, I fell in love with Edward.Rather than a comedic sketch of a person with mental illness, Craig created an endearing character who faces many of the same life questions and obstacles that the rest of us do: A shaky relationship with his father, a not-so-successful on-line dating experience, and an attempt to better himself through counseling. In the end, he faces a choice: Open his life to experience and deal with the joys and heartaches that come with it, or remain behind his closed door, a solitary soul.This story is humorous and it is touching. It kept me eagerly turning the pages from the first to the last, and it is a story that stays with me long after I finished. I give 600 Hours of Edward Five Stars and highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Tulay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36800166-tulay", "userReview": "Must read story.While reading/listening this book, in some parts I teared up, at the same time I was smiling.

At the end not only he made peace with his parents and looks like he will have a bright future too.

Such was this book for me. If not for its selection in a GR group read I would never have discovered it. According to the author page this was written \u201cin less than 600 hours during National Novel Writing Month in 2008\u201d by a newspaper journalist. I just think that\u2019s cool. It\u2019s also kind of offbeat, being published by Amazon Encore, something I\u2019ve never really given notice to before. In all honesty I didn\u2019t exactly buy the rapid progress Edward made in this book. In one month he goes from being rather reclusive 39-year-old with Asperger\u2019s and OCD to a man finding pleasure in conversation with the grocery clerk, pursuing a friendship with a woman and her son who\u2019ve moved in across the street, and the acceptance of a job that will upset his routines. He also makes great emotional leaps in family doings. But there was a sweetness and lovability to this tale that just delivered to me - a few made-for-TV humorous conversations, a love of words that word-lovers can relate to, and a fanaticism with the Dragnet and the Dallas Cowboys. (Okay. I don\u2019t love Dragnet or the Dallas Cowboys.) This book was never meant for greatness but thankfully there are people and awards out there that recognize such writing and bring it to readers attention. In this case it was 2009 Montana Honor Book and a 2010 High Plaines Book winner for best first book.Nice little diversion from the last two literary heavies I read.

I liked Edward, and he was relatable, which I really liked given his mental health issues. I was unsure how real his experiences would be compared to someone who actually struggles with Asperger's; I would be interested in reading a non-fiction book about this. I found myself skipping over the parts about Dragnet and the Dallas Cowboys just to get through the story.

Edward is such a fantastic character, you would need to have a heart of stone to not take him. I was actually quite jealous of Donna and her son Kyle as i really wanted to be friend him.

Because I go to bed promptly at midnight, I am accustomed to stirring at 7:38, but occasionally, I will wake up a little earlier or a little later. The range isn\u2019t large\u2014sometimes it\u2019s 7:37, and sometimes it\u2019s 7:40, and it has been 7:39 (twenty-two times this year, in fact), but 7:38 is the time I expect. It has happened 221 times so far this year, so if it were you, you would expect it, too. (You\u2019re probably wondering how frequently I\u2019ve been up at other times: fifteen for 7:37 and twenty-nine for 7:40.). I write down the time I woke up, and my data is complete.I'm glad for Kindle Unlimited and how it made me open up to other books besides my go-to fantasy. 600 Hours of Edward is a beautiful story with lots of heart. It's an intimate 25-day story of a man, Asperger's syndrome and OCD aside, who has issues with his father and interaction with society or people in general. Because of his condition, his thoughts are completely unfiltered and honest. This was probably one of the most compelling reasons why I really liked this story. Far from being simple-minded, Edward is quite smart but his inability to adapt to social situations and people in general made him a recluse. The rigidity of his daily life was thrown off-kilter with the arrival of new neighbours, Donna and her son, Kyle. Somewhere along the line, it created further problems with his father but drew him out of his seclusion in ways which surprise and tug at the heart. Edward's relationship with his father was the highlight of this book and man, it was just so darn beautiful. The ending was quite perfect, and to my surprise and delight, there is a sequel which I will definitely get to soon enough.

You will fall in love with Edward very soon in the book and I didn't realize until I had finished that I had not really felt sorry for him during the reading. I think he would say this is a good thing. I did feel sorry for his dad, but I'll say no more about that, so as not to spoil.

His carefully constructed routine includes tracking his most common waking time (7:38 a.m.), refusing to start his therapy sessions even a minute before the appointed hour (10:00 a.m.), and watching one episode of the 1960s cop show Dragnet each night (10:00 p.m.).But when a single mother and her nine-year-old son move in across the street, Edward\u2019s timetable comes undone. Over the course of a momentous 600 hours, he opens up to his new neighbors and confronts old grievances with his estranged parents.
