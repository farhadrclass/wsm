They did not even know what a computer was as young children but they had the imagination to find their toys in the right places. They made something from nothing.It is for this reason that I wanted to read this book of the young Malawian boy who made life better by using his intellect, despite being thrown out of school due to a lack of payment, and a devastating famine, which pushed their community to the ground and beyond. He persisted with his dream to create electricity for his family and community. And he did it. A good inspiring read that made a difference to many lives. Young people should read this, if they can get over their own me-me-me-self-entitlements. The story speaks to the heart and highlight values that might be foreign to many young people nowadays.I felt so happy when I finished reading this book.

Every adult and every kid should read it (except for those kids whose parents are not ok with them reading vivid descriptions of someone dying from gonorrhoea - but even those kids should probably rebel against their parents and read it anyway).As any review will tell you 'The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind' is about a boy who did just that - he built a windmill from junk using some second-hand book about physics that was donated to his village library. He then became one of the TED speakers and basically put Malawi on the map.Make no mistake, though. This book is definitely not a boring account of how one makes electricity from trash (although there are plenty of practical tips should you need them). It's a vivid memoir, written in a simple but compelling way. It starts, like any good African narrative with some ancestral tales and a little bit of magic. William's first years are lived in the fuzzy area between science and magic. His curiosity and ingenuity is obvious from the first chapters which describe the games he used to play with his friends and the little radio fixing business he set up with his cousin when they were just little boys. It goes on to the painful part where William is forced to drop out from the secondary school after it barely started because his parents can't afford the fees. This chapter is followed by a harrowing account of the famine in Malawi in 2001. I don't think I will forget it any time soon. It starts out benignly enough - the family decides to skip breakfast and have only two meals a day. Pages later they can barely get up and all look like their own shadows. As I mentioned in my review of Mindless Eating I do have this very unreasonable fear of dying from hunger and this chapter affected me deeply. I still can't get over it. One day I will probably forget all the intricacies of building a windmill but that vision of whole villages dying of hunger will stay to haunt me forever.(I remember reading this romantic novel 'The Bronze Horseman' which turned out to be almost entirely forgettable except for those chapters dealing with the famine during the siege of Leningrad. Even just thinking about this makes me hungry.)Despite all odds, William survives and thrives. It's not only poverty he is up against, it's the children who still go to school who mock him for spending all his days at the scrapyard digging through trash and reading 'Using Physics'. Everyone thinks him a madman until he triumphs. Now, this is what I call heart-warming! Not some bullshit stories about cats."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "William Kambkwambwa was always a curious child. His curiosity about the workings of the world took a hit when his family was unable to afford to keep him in school. But he tried to keep up, going to the library and reading everything he could. He was particularly taken with books on science and on how things work. In this engaging and uplifting story, the young inventor tells of his experience in Malawi constructing a working windmill from bits and pieces retrieved from junkyards, using a design based on a book he got from the library. But the story goes well beyond his personal experience. He tells us about his community, a small village reliant on agriculture for sustenance and imperiled by the vagaries of nature and a corrupt government. He introduces us to his family, his much-admired father, his friends, the village chief, and offers a real feel for what life looks like in this part of the world. There is a long section in which Kambkwamba reports the frightening details of when famine struck his village, how the families coped, or failed, how the government responded. It is riveting material. Also of considerable interest is the degree to which people in Malawi hold on to a belief in magic one would have thought had faded long ago. William was at risk of being persecuted as a witch for his invention. Some people were killed as the hungry sought a magical explanation for the lack of rain, and scapegoats were found. That is as chilling as his tale of drought and desperation. In the latter part of the book, the young inventor is finally discovered and we see some of his wonder as he is introduced to a much wider world and finally comes to gain a society of peers. There can be no doubt that William Kambkwamba is a remarkable young man, and that he will continue to achieve great things, for himself, for his family, for his village, nation and for Africa. This book should be counted among those achievements."}, {"userName": "PDXReader", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2140505-pdxreader", "userReview": "This book sat on my shelf for over a year mostly due to its unfortunate title. It certainly sounded boring! I only read it because it filled a challenge need. I was delighted to find, though, that it was far from dull, and I can honestly say that it's become one of my new all-time favorites. It's one of those books I want to hand to all my friends and say, \"Read this. You'll love it!\" Although the book is certainly about Kamkwamba creating a way to generate electricity, that part of his story comes well past the midway point. First readers get to enjoy African folk tales, which are followed by the harrowing story of William's life in famine-stricken Malawi. THEN comes the part about electricity. It's very entertaining, interesting, and exceptionally well-told. The first-person account is by turns moving, funny, horrifying, and, yes, inspiring. I completely enjoyed it and highly recommend it, even to people who don't generally read non-fiction."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "No more skipping breakfast; no more dropping out of school. With a windmill, we'd finally release ourselves from the troubles of of darkness and hunger. In Malawi, the wind was one of the few consistent things given to us by God, blowing in the treetops day and night. A windmill meant more than just power, it was freedom. This story about a boy who grows up in poverty in the farming villages of Malawi, survives famine and diseases, drops out of grade school because of poor grades, and ends up becoming one of the world's inventors and later a college graduate, is uplifting. Exceptional protagonist--and I only use the word protagonist because this book was co-written.The story about how William Kamkwamba discovers a way to give his house free electricity is fascinating: his discovering the difference between alternating and direct current by flipping a bike upside down, pedaling, and stacking batteries from a radio and running a wire from batteries to bulb; his collection of windmill pieces (i.e: shock absorbers, tractor fans )in his bedroom, and how he educated himself through books like  Explaining Physics,  Integrated Science,  and  Using Energy:Energy is all around you every day, it said. Sometimes energy needs to be converted to another form before it is useful to us. How can we convert forms of energy?  Kamkwamba came of age during controversial Malawian President Muluzi's administration, where the country's maize supply (the main food staple) was at an all-time low allegedly due to the administration's corruption. Yet, he was still determined, despite knowing that this energy project wasn't putting food on the table nor paying his tuition.It was this determination while in the midst of poverty and famine, this stubborn self-education from used library books, as well as the people who supported him throughout the process, (like the local African intellectual and historian who marched to the Ministry Of Education demanding that this young inventor be accepted back into school despite his grades and age), that were the highlights for me. Reading a memoir co-written by another is tricky though, because you're never too sure when you're actually hearing from the protagonist or the writer. Did William Kamkwamba really want to utilize a few pages making generalizations of Africa or Malawi, or did he want to simply talk about the village that he loved? Did he want chapter after chapter of brutal, descriptive, elaborate imagery of hunger and sickness or did he see hunger as smaller pockets in his larger narrative of human strife? Did he want the information about how his knowledge of energy prompted him to drill his mother a well for drinking water, and assemble a solar-powered pump for his father's field to only appear in one paragraph of the book? We'll never know.Nonetheless, this is a book I would highly recommend for readers of inspirational non-fiction, and one I really hope more middle and high school teachers will adopt."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/642041-sarah", "userReview": "This is one of the most inspiring books I've ever read.

Prior to that, the book might have been titled \"Growing Up in a Small Village in Africa\" - the first half of the book really is there to set the stage on the location, the people, and the situation. What the reader will remember is the description of the famine that hit the author's country. When the author finally gets around to his windmill, I was pleased to read the detail around how he thought about his project and how he was able to put the pieces together. To me, that made the book worthwhile, seeing an example of someone being resourceful in his situation. The ending of the book was a bit of a fish out of water story with the author presenting at a TED conference, but I was disappointed that the author's plans for using wind power to provide irrigation was covered in a measly page or less, and was accomplished not through his proven mechanical know-how, but through donations from the West. And using solar cells, not wind. The author uses donations to provide power and water to his village - it sounded like he chose for who and where he had projects done. The last 10% of the book could have been called \"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wealthy Donor\". I hope Kamkwamba perseveres in his mechanical talent and avoids settling for the money -- his ingenuity can take him far."}, {"userName": "Mal Warwick", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick", "userReview": "A debate has been raging for years within that rarefied global community that earns its keep from the business of what we Americans call \u201cforeign aid.\u201d (Others, less afflicted by an aversion to international engagement, call the field \u201coverseas development assistance.\u201d)On one side are the advocates for large-scale bilateral and multilateral aid, insisting that huge grants from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and their ilk are the only source of real hope for the many desperately poor nations of what is broadly, though incorrectly, called the Global South (Asia, Africa, and Latin America). The advocate-in-chief for this perspective is Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University, who has argued that massive infusions of aid to the governments of the poorest nations can lift them out of poverty in short order. In 2006, Sachs published his seminal book, The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time, a work that provided the rationale for the Millennium Development Goals.Arrayed against Sachs and his colleagues are the born-again critics of government-to-government aid, most noticeably William Easterly, a long-time World Bank economist who came in from the cold in recent years to testify to the widespread failure of \u201cforeign aid.\u201d His 2007 book, The White Man\u2019s Burden: Why the West\u2019s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good, set off the debate between the two opposing camps.The gist of the difference between the two perspectives is simple: One side insists that the problem of poverty is far too big to be addressed through anything other than large-scale action carried out within each poor country on a national scale. The other side contends that top-down, nationwide development programs rarely work and that only solutions crafted at the grassroots and adopted by those who are most affected by them can bring about genuine social change.Though I\u2019ve read a number of other books taking one side or another in this debate, the work that has cast the most light on the topic is one that paid no attention whatsoever to \u201cforeign aid\u201d or economic development schemes, whether large or small. It\u2019s an extraordinary, first-person tale by a young man from Malawi entitled The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind.William Kamkwamba, the narrator of this awe-inspiring story, was a seventh-grade dropout who mastered fundamental physics by reading an out-of-date English textbook in a local, three-shelf library near his village and using his knowledge to construct a working windmill out of junkyard parts to generate electricity to irrigate his father\u2019s farm. He was 14 years old.You can read news reports and even the most perceptive magazine articles about the challenges of development, but you won\u2019t get nearly as close to the essential truth of the challenge as you will from reading The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Kamkwamba\u2019s tale is unsparing of himself, his community, and his country. Through his all-seeing eyes, we witness the tragic consequences of the profound official corruption that held sway in Malawi for so many years after it gained its independence from Britain in 1964. We feel the unrelenting hunger he and his family experienced for months on end in the famine of 2001-2002. We see the darkness descend all around us as William is hounded by fearful villagers who can only explain his windmill as magical. But, most of all, we observe the steady evolution of his brilliant young mind as he confronts one setback after another, and prevails over them all.If there is hope for Africa, as I firmly believe, it lies in the minds and hearts of William Kamkwamba and other young people whose innate genius is unlocked by the spread of education and opportunity for self-expression at the grassroots. There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of William Kamkwambas across Sub-Saharan Africa. And it will be a combination of top-down aid \u2013 to build schools, train teachers, and buy textbooks \u2013 with the local action of countless NGOs, with both local and international support, that will provide them with the tools and the freedom to solve the problems that have held down their forebears for generations past. I don\u2019t think genuine development \u2013 thorough-going social change \u2013 will come any other way."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/909911-erika", "userReview": "The fascinating and true story of William Kamkwamba, a curious and ingenious 14 year old boy who is forced to drop out of school as his family teeters on the edge of starvation during a serious drought in his home country of Malawi (Africa). William, who unsuccessfully tries to sneak back into school, makes use of the public library in an attempt to teach himself and stay caught up with his class. In the library he discovers a book about generating electricity through windmills. He can hardly read the words (as they are in English), but inspired by the pictures and his own imagination, and using items he scavenges from the dump and elsewhere, he builds a working windmill to generate electricity for his family's home.

The first part of the book gives you insight into Kamkwamba's life and struggles. His challenges are the type that you can already imagine in broad strokes, but Kamkwamba and co-author Mealer help you experience them in a visceral way. The description of the famine was nearly too much to bear. At the same time, you see the sparks of curiosity, resourcefulness, determination, and intelligence that eventually lead him to try to build a windmill. His dream is to create electricity to help his family and maybe even his whole village. But this is no naively idealistic Quixote. Kamkwamba may be visionary but he has an ability to balance that with an acceptance of the realities he faces. I think that makes you want to root for him even more.

This is better than a 3-star book (which is okay), but it is not at the 4-star level (which for me means excellent).So, this is a memoir by a young man from Malawi who, as a teenager, built a windmill \u2013 with only a book to guide him and using materials he was able to scrounge locally \u2013 to bring electricity to his home. William Kamkwamba is born one of several children in a farming family in rural Malawi, grows up without electricity or running water, and endures more than his share of hardship as a boy, including a severe famine and having to drop out of school (which is a real hardship for a smart and ambitious kid who loves science) due to his family\u2019s inability to pay the fees. But he perseveres and ultimately gains international recognition and support.All that makes a great story, and ultimately a triumphant one, though readers shouldn\u2019t expect a feel-good book from start to finish \u2013 the section on the famine is long and detailed. But it is a quick and easy read. In fact, the matter-of-fact writing style is perhaps too simple; it is unclear to me why there is a separate young-adult version of this book, when this is about as YA as a memoir can get. It is also most definitely written for an American audience: for instance, by explaining Malawian holidays in terms of American ones. But, I suppose the co-author\u2019s job was making the story accessible, and in its content it feels true to the way a technologically-minded boy views the world. There is a lot of discussion of Kamkwamba\u2019s projects (though again, written in a very accessible way) and much less insight into the people around him, only a few of whom get much notice.But I don\u2019t want to criticize this book too harshly for not being a literary memoir, when it isn\u2019t meant to be. It is meant to be the story of a talented kid who achieves his dreams in the face of incredible odds, and in that sense it\u2019s a success."}, {"userName": "Val", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33970999-val", "userReview": "I chose to read this book as part as my world-lit challenge that I think I have already mentioned in other posts. My original book was a novel that I thought I would love, but that I could never find, haha. I then chose this one and I must say it was an amazing idea to do so.William Kamkwamba is a Malawian boy who, at age 14, builds his first \"big windmill\", having read some physics in borrowed books and grabbed metal pieces from an abandoned scrapyard. He then wrote and published this book which is, indeed, his autobiography. I found it super interesting and what caught my attention the most was how, at some points, I actually thought I was reading a novel rather than an actual biography. I think this is due to the fact that William's life seemed so tough when he was a kid, that my subconscious didn't realize it wasn't fiction. I must admit that this book took me very long to finish, which in the end I found kind of annoying. I studied some physics at high school and so I understood some of the terms that William mentions throughout his autobiography, but some parts were very detailed and written in terms that made them quite tedious to follow. However it wouldn't have been the same without them, since they truly show how brilliant this man's mind is, and how much he achieved having lived a poor life.I'm very happy I chose to read this book, because it's inspiring and empowering (clich\u00e9?). But really, being a student in university I think this is something everyone should read, especially during exam periods in which one wants to drop everything. William Kamkwamba didn't and he got to where he wanted; why should anyone do, then?"}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/339857-cindy", "userReview": "In the LDS Church, we are encouraged to fast for two consecutive meals on the first Sunday of every month. It's not just 'going hungry' - we are to ask for spiritual help with something, or to bless someone else, and to pray for an increased measure of the Spirit as we fast. Then we take the money we would have spent on those meals and donate it to the Church for the support of the poor in our area. I must admit that I am not great about following this practice. We have always been faithful in the payment of our fast offerings, donating as much as we could, much more than the cost of the food itself, whenever we can. But the going without food part is hard for me.This weekend I grabbed a library book that will forever change how I look at the fast. It's called \"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,\" by William Kambewamba. William grew up in the African nation of Malawi, the son of a farmer. His family would grow maize, or corn, and tobacco every year, milling the food they needed for themselves and using the money they earned to provide for their needs for the year. One year they had planted their maize, as usual, but the rains didn't come. For weeks the crop struggled along, with the seeds barely breaking threw the soil. Then the rains came, but all once. The seeds were washed away in a flood. William's family planted again, but they couldn't afford fertilizer and the crop didn't have enough time to grow before the harvest. The entire nation was affected.His family got their grain milled, one bag at a time, but they had only five bags to last them all year. At first, they hoped that the government would come through with the food they needed. But instead, corrupt official sold what grain they could and the surplus disappeared. So people starved. When the grain was almost gone, the hungry people took the husks of the corn, the green part I throw away every time I cook corn, and ground that up and ate it. When it began to run out, they mixed the husks with sawdust and at that. They ate the leaves of the pumpkin vines. They even ate the seed corn, scrubbing off as much insecticide as they could. William's family saved their seed corn, but they were down to a tablespoon of food or so a day. Then it was time to plant. With their bellies aching from hunger, and sometimes too dizzy to stand and temporarily blinded, they found the strength to plant their seeds. And then they prayed. The rains came, and the people had food again.As I read William's story, and his desperate attempts to gain an education and break this cycle of subsistence farming, I found myself thinking about my cupboard full of food. All those stories of 'children starving in Africa' and how I needed to clean my plate ran through my head. And yet, what would William have done with my breakfast cereal, my mashed potatoes and meat loaf, my tuna casserole? They wouldn't have even known what it was, much less how to cook it. Their special Christmas treat was rice and meat.Last night I prepared for my fast today with a completely different attitude. It wasn't that by fasting I could somehow bless those who are hungry in tiny nations across the world. It wasn't even that I could somehow alleviate the hunger of those in this country. It was because I needed to remember that food is a blessing, that I am lucky to have enough to eat. If we run out of food and money again, I know that I can count on my church, on my government, on my family. The stores have plenty of food. But over the history of the world, most people were not that lucky. So my fast becomes an act of gratitude that I am blessed, and a reminder that I need to help others who are not so lucky.This was an amazing book. William's father ran out of money so could not pay for his son's education. William had to quit school and go to work on the farm. He tried to keep up with what his classmates were learning and found the local library. There he found books on electricity, physics, and energy. He decided to build a windmill. He scrounged parts from the junkyard, took apart radios and engines, and got help from his friends, but he succeeded. He was able to use his windmill to provide energy for little light bulbs in his house so he could see to read at night. Soon word of his project got out and he attracted the attention of journalists and scientists. They helped him make his windmill stronger and safer, dig a well so his family could have clean water, replace his grass roof with a tin one, and provide electricity for his entire village. It is an amazing story of determination and triumph over adversity that will inspire anyone. And it changed the way I look at what I have. I have a cupboard full of food, clean water with the turn of the faucet, a sturdy house, electricity and heating, a way to keep myself and my clothing clean. I am not afraid of soldiers with guns taking what I have. I can send my children to school for free. I can go to the doctor when I am sick.I am blessed. And I need to remember that."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane", "userReview": "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind: Creating Currents of Electricity and Hope, will be released on September 29th. This memoir was one of those rare stories you won't want to miss.William Kamkwamba , was raised in Malawi - Africa. Malawi was a place where most people believed in magic and curses. It was a rural area where poverty was wide-spread, government corrupt, and the people lived without electricity or water. His family lived a very simple life; they had a small farm which they relied on for food, and a small income. William's father wants his son to continue his education, so that he would have a better life, but here school is for families who have the money to pay for it.When the terrible drought occurs, Malawi experiences the worst famine in 50 years. When William's family can no longer afford tuition, he must drop out of school. William finds an old science textbook in the school's library, and he studied the diagrams and saw what windmills were capable of doing. This fourteen year old had a dream of bringing electricity and water to the people of Malawi.Mechanically inclined, and using old parts, wire, pipe and other things he could find and felt useful, he never gives up on his dream. While the people around him called him crazy, he persisted with his project, in the hopes of improving the lives of his family and the people around him. A dream, a vision, determination and hope was all it took.One of the most inspiring books that I have read in a long time, I'm pretty sure this book will touch most readers deeply, like it did to me. I know this story will stay with me for a long time to come. In my opinion, this book would be excellent reading and discussion material for high school classes and book clubs everywhere.

Ikut senang rasanya.Tak hanya perjuangan untuk melawan kelaparan yang membuatku terharu, keinginan besar William, dan bapaknya, agar William bisa bersekolah juga membuatku terharu. Mungkin anak-anak sekolah yang malas-malasan harus membaca buku ini supaya lebih mensyukuri kemudahan yang telah mereka dapatkan untuk bersekolah.Dan doaku untuk Afrika: semoga tak ada lagi perang saudara, kelaparan dan wabah penyakit. Semoga semakin banyak orang-orang seperti William yang tetap berusaha walaupun dengan segala keterbatasan."}, {"userName": "Marco Pavan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41612121-marco-pavan", "userReview": "This book is very well written. The flow of the story is excellent and the narration really works. William's story is a true inspiration. I was moved by his mental strength, the endurance through the hardships and the famine, and his ability to overcome difficulties and fight his way through giving himself an education, understanding the principles of physics and electromagnetism to build a windmill, and providing energy to power his house.The reason i found this story truly inspiring was because William, despite just being a young teenager, deeply understood the environment where he lived. It was never explicitly mentioned throughout the book, but in my opinion William's greatest strength was \"observing\", assessing and analyzing. Self teaching physics and the principles of electricity is already remarkable, a great feat for sure. But being able to observe and analyze the environment the way he did, that's genius. Observing that wind is abundant all year around, observing parts from the scrapyard, observing how people were using electricity, observing that his mother had to walk hours every day to get clean water. An then analyzing what to do to move forward, hitting roadblocks and working around them. He was already an engineer way before starting secondary school.Thank you William for sharing your story through such a wonderful book"}, {"userName": "Seth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2328082-seth", "userReview": "It's easy to say a book \"isn't just about (insert subject)\" but The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind really is not just about William Kamkwamba's windmill. The windmill doesn't even come to fruition until about two hundred pages in. The majority of the book is about William's life as a child and the culture of his homeland in Malawi (Africa), which at times is depressing - his family lives with the bare minimum, they survive a famine, and William wasn't able to attend school due to financial constraints. If you can't express pity for these people, you aren't human.The details of farming, magic (yes, magic as in wizardry and curses), and everything else surrounding William's life is dragged out a bit more than necessary, but it makes the \"feel good\" aspect that much more appreciated in the end. Having virtually no schooling or money, William toyed with the intricacies of electricity and ultimately constructed a working windmill. Most adults with a college education probably couldn't pull this off! This boy had nothing and now he has worldwide recognition, not to mention electricity in his home."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2414235-karen", "userReview": "I LOVED this book. I would give it 10 stars if I could. What an awesome story of perseverance. William Kamkwamba was a young boy when he had to leave school because his family could not afford the tuition. To stay out of trouble he visited the small library where he discovered books on science. He used what he learned in those books to build a windmill and bring electricity to his village. The story of the famine his country faced is heartbreaking. Although, Mr Kamkwamba became world famous for his invention he remains a humble and likable person. His trials and errors reminded me of the golden age of invention when people like Edison used all types of implausible materials. At one point, when lacking a soldering iron, William used the heat from his mother's cooking stove to melt wires together. The human drama of the famine his country faced is heartbreaking. It's hard to believe that such terrible conditions could exist in today's world and even harder to believe that an uneducated young man could accomplish what Mr. Kamkwamaba has."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/234103-paul", "userReview": "The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind is an absolutely inspiring story. I was fascinated and amazed by the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the young Malawian boy who taught, equipped, and motivated himself to effect change amid his often brutal and demanding surroundings to better his life and the lives of those around him.More importantly, it was so refreshing to have a current-day perspective of a very real way of life outside the usual comforts of the United States. The true story, told from the perspective of the main character whose family farms in a small village in Malawi, reminds this otherwise pampered American of the very real hardships of life for much of the world. I've decided to require my 11 year-old son to read this story (before Thanksgiving) to help give him a perspective I hope he will contemplate and understand. In the current, very American society in which we live, it's good to remember that food, shelter and medical care are no more entitlements than electricity."}, {"userName": "Steve Comstock", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28108653-steve-comstock", "userReview": "If I only had one word to describe this incredibly inspiring memoir, it would be \"indomitable\".

This is a book that will stick with me forever. He has an amazing story to tell and he is an amazing storyteller. I actually listened to the audiobook which I highly recommend because the reader has an African accent which makes it so fun to listen to and more authentic than reading in my own voice in my head. It took me by surprise every time he mentioned the year, because of the village life he was living, I kept assuming he was telling a story from a long time ago. It's a real eye-opener to those of us living amongst such wealth and resources that we have in this country. I can't seem to find the words to express how much this book has affected me. I find myself thinking about William and his family and his village all of the time. I give it 4.5 stars instead of the full 5 because the last quarter of the book really didn't match up to the first 3/4. But that's still a lot of stars coming from me! I recommend this to everyone!PS - After you read the book, I would also recommend watching 2 TED talks online of William on stage.

Initially mocked by his community for his strange project, his success earns him renown and enough money to help his family and friends. He returns to school and begins working to help his country and continent.Here's the other extreme: this book.In between these two extremes, you have a touching and inspiring story which would have made a great \"New Yorker\" article. I was so moved by William's struggle -- the hunger he suffered, his desperate desire to attend school, his eagerness to absorb the principles of physics from library books, his indomitable spirit as a young teen resisting the mockery around him and doggedly sticking to his unprecedented project, the moment he tried out his windmill and the connected light bulb actually lit up, the tears from the audience as he struggled to describe his work in English and finally ended up with the words, \"I try, and I make it!\", his excitement as he met new people who introduced him to laptops, the internet, etc., his decision to use his funds to help his friends return to school and install running water for his family, etc., etc. Unfortunately, this great story was not well served by the book, which was difficult to get into and overly detailed and meandering at times. I certainly appreciated William's story and the window into what it might be like to grow up in a Malawi village, but a tighter and more cohesive narrative would have enhanced this experience a great deal. The physics details, though relevant I suppose, were a bit excessive for someone who was simply interested in the human interest aspect of the story. I might attribute this to my not being a science person and/or to my listening on audio, but Rebecca Skloot (also an audio experience) managed to keep the necessary scientific details of her book interesting and not burdensome, so clearly it can be done.Overall, I'm not sorry I read this book and every time I think about the story I feel moved. But the credit for that belongs to William, not to the book."}, {"userName": "edh", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/971061-edh", "userReview": "\"I went to sleep dreaming of Malawi, and all the things made possible when your dreams are powered by your heart.\"William Kamkwamba lived in an Africa of contradictions, where witchcraft bumped against faith in God and Allah-- where famine followed drought and officials denied the people's mortal hardships. The worst contradiction of all was that his family could work hard all year to plant a good crop just to see nature sweep it away from them; a people who barely subsisted hand to mouth. And when William believed he would never return to school for a lack of money, that was when his real learning began... sparked by the connection between bicycle light dynamos and his fascination with a library book describing how to build an \"electric wind.\" Henry Adams himself could not have been more fascinated by the potential of a simple dynamo to conquer darkness, thirst, and hunger. William's motivation was to change his family's fortunes through a new harvest of abundant and free wind power-- but he ended up tapping into his own talent to pull a community from the edge of poverty with nothing more than bits of junk and scrap metal. I first heard about William's story through AfriGadget & TED, and I also saw his work featured at the Chicago Museum of Science & Industry! Getting to read about his family and his hopes for a better future makes his accomplishments seem even more staggering. There is something magical about learning as you go, being driven by need and love, and the insistence on innovation despite naysayers and failure. His story will certainly inspire many people to dream of a better tomorrow... and to know that they can make it happen with little more than a book, some spare parts, and persistence."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy", "userReview": "A delightful entertaining read, this is the true story of a teenage boy with a little education and a lot of heart who becomes a self-taught engineer. His family is on the verge of starvation during a famine in Malawi when William gets a book from the local library that inspires him to experiment on creating energy from the wind. There is no word for 'windmill' in the Malawian language and so he calls it \"electric wind\". His friends and people in the village and even his family think he's a little crazy, but they become believers when he is able to listen to the radio or read by the windmill-powered light bulb at night. It is a testament to his thirst for knowledge and his indomitable spirit. He is eventually \"discovered\" at a TED talk and is able to return to school to further his education. It is an inspiring story, all the more so because of the difficulties and sorrows he faced along the way. This story gives you pause. I found myself wondering how many other talents were discarded because the fight for survival was too overwhelming and how many other dreams have died because they did not have the resources. I was time and again reminded how blessed we are in America, having so much that is taken for granted, even in the poorer areas. The descriptions of the awe and child-like joy that William felt when he saw New York and California for the first time are wonderful.

It was also a land withered by drought and hunger, and a place where hope and opportunity were hard to find. But William had read about windmills in a book called Using Energy, and he dreamed of building one that would bring electricity and water to his village and change his life and the lives of those around him. His neighbors may have mocked him and called him misala\u2014crazy\u2014but William was determined to show them what a little grit and ingenuity could do.Enchanted by the workings of electricity as a boy, William had a goal to study science in Malawi's top boarding schools. But in 2002, his country was stricken with a famine that left his family's farm devastated and his parents destitute. Unable to pay the eighty-dollar-a-year tuition for his education, William was forced to drop out and help his family forage for food as thousands across the country starved and died.Yet William refused to let go of his dreams. With nothing more than a fistful of cornmeal in his stomach, a small pile of once-forgotten science textbooks, and an armory of curiosity and determination, he embarked on a daring plan to bring his family a set of luxuries that only two percent of Malawians could afford and what the West considers a necessity\u2014electricity and running water. Using scrap metal, tractor parts, and bicycle halves, William forged a crude yet operable windmill, an unlikely contraption and small miracle that eventually powered four lights, complete with homemade switches and a circuit breaker made from nails and wire. A second machine turned a water pump that could battle the drought and famine that loomed with every season.Soon, news of William's magetsi a mphepo\u2014his \"electric wind\"\u2014spread beyond the borders of his home, and the boy who was once called crazy became an inspiration to those around the world.Here is the remarkable story about human inventiveness and its power to overcome crippling adversity.
