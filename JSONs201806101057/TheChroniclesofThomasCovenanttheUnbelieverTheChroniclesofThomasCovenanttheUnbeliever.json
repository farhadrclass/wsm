Plus, the follow-on trilogy tells almost the same story with almost the same point to it.So, what's the fuss about?Covenant isn't \"Tolkien with the serial numbers filed off.\" That it holds together with a complete fantasy story in a clear, magical fantasy world and you never once want to compare it to Middle Earth is a good enough start to recommend reading it. Covenant is a fantasy The Stranger, taking a disaffected character who denies all responsibility in his life and feels completely disconnected from the world around him and giving him the power of life and death. The character Thomas Covenant is definitely unappealing. I put the book down and had to restart it 3 times after a scene in the first book where he--refusing to believe that the woman he was with was anything other than a dream--committed a rape. The morality of how you treat not-real people is a regular theme of Donaldson's and this is his first and harshest demonstration of the subject. It's not easy to read and it's not easy to go on with a protagonist like that.Watching him slowly learn guilt, remorse, and repentence takes the next two-and-a-half books. As many people comment, that portion of the story is a downer. Alongside the moral tale we have the fantasy epic: a modern American man returning to a fantasy world (The Land) several times seeing the consequences of his involvement in their epic battle against their own satan-figure: Lord Foul, who wants to break the Arch of the World and release himself into our universes.Everyone in The Land believes that Covenant is the \"White Gold Wielder\" who carries power strong enough to break the arch or to stop Foul. This sets up the fantasy/action story, where the people of The Land try to convince Covenant to learn to use his powers and to use them for the greater good and Foul tries to get the power.Since Covenant only visits The Land when he's suffered a head injury or some other strange type of sleep, he believes The Land is a fantasy of his own imagination. The people in The Land don't understand why he doesn't believe in them, but they do see how broken he himself is and realize that he won't be able to help them unless he heals from his personal traumas and builds some positive self-concept. It's a strange twist on the \"apprentice who just needs confidence\" trope and his mistakes during the early period are all the more appalling because he doesn't feel guilty.Throughout the book, there is not one scene in The Land that doesn't include Covenant. At the end, we are left with no proof one way or another that The Land is a real alternate world where Covenant travelled. Perhaps his Unbelief at the beginning was correct. The existential element of the story asks why we care which is real; he does what he does and the morality comes from his making the choices.That's heady stuff for a lightning-bolt-slinging fantasy series and it's not for everyone. It isn't modern \"dark fantasy\" with supposed anti-heroes who are just ashamed of being good at heart, it's real fantasy where the character development is on as epic a scale as the good-vs-evil plot. This isn't bus reading and no book is right for everyone, but it's an audacious and brilliant series that flexes fantasy's power to drive character. It's also a fun read with the single scariest magical nasties in the genre (the Reavers).The second series? It's different on the moral tale while following the same general plot arc, showing how the character involved changes the story. Not worth reading for everyone, but worth a shot if you like the first or if you are interested in the structure of fiction."}, {"userName": "Szplug", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1843184-szplug", "userReview": "THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILAGE UP THE YING-YANG.It's unfortunate that Donaldson opted to conclude the First Chronicles of Thomas Covenant as he did\u2014for it reduced the showdown between the titular protagonist and Lord Foul the Despiser, which should have been epic, to one bordering upon the ridiculous. Indeed, I would have to look to David Eddings' reductio ad absurdum\u2014in which the evil god Torak is defeated, more or less, by (Bel)Garion taunting him with the fact that Ye'll never be loved, gasbag! Nyaahh!\u2014to find a greater disappointment in the endgame of a multi-volume work of fantasy. The spectral presence of personal favorites, like Foamfollower and Mhoram, went a ways towards alleviating my disappointment; but it was only modulated\u2014a disappointment it remained. Fortunately, in the Second Chronicles, to which the character of Linden Avery was enjoined with TC, Donaldson's climax got everything right; and so, considering the pair of trilogies as one cohesive unit, it's the third best such series that I have ever read. Split them in twain? The second, though stronger, cannot match the pure wonder and introductory thrill that was to be found in the opener. Lord Foul's Bane, The Illearth War, and The Power That Preserves rocked my youthful world and were powerful evidence that Tolkien did not, in fact, have the final word to say in the field of heroic fantasy.Perhaps anti-heroic applies more aptly here\u2014for Thomas Covenant is one peculiar choice for the redeemer of an idealistic world from the nihilistic designs of hatred incarnate. In the real world, Covenant was an author with a happy marriage and a newborn child who was diagnosed with leprosy, resulting in the amputation of two of the fingers on his right hand, and the cleaving of his family life as wife absconded with child out of fear of contagion. Embittered, reclusive, Covenant learns a series of mantras and rituals that will allow him to survive his disease\u2014and also prove pretty darn handy when, upon suffering a series of accidents, he is summoned to a mysterious earthen realm known as The Land, an idealized version of our Earth, wherein wood and stone are vessels of an innate Earthpower that can be accessed by humans with the requisite skills. Covenant discovers that therein he is regarded as the reincarnation of Berek Halfhand, first of the High Lords who ordered the affairs of humans within the Land in harmony to the Earthpower of living Nature, defeated the insidious destructive influence of Lord Foul, and received the friendship/allegiance of the stone-skilled, expert-sailor Giants, the Haruchai, who, in the Bloodguard, form a personal, death-defying corps of protectors for the High Lords, and the Ranyhyn, great horses of the plains. Alas, Lord Foul is a timeless spirit, one who reflects the collective self-hatred and -loathing that exists, in some measure, within every man, and is thus impervious to actual death. After unleashing despair among the High Lords, Lord Foul convinced High Lord Kevin to invoke the Ritual of Desecration which, as apocalyptic rites undertaken in desperation are wont to do, fractured the Land but good. Lore, lives, and love was lost\u2014and now, with the diminished remnant of the High Lords tentatively ruling from their Keep in Revelstoke, it appears that Lord Foul, ensconced within his Creche of a lair, is once again making a play to enact the utter destruction of the Land and engender his escape from imprisonment within the Arch of Time.Sound familiar? There are some fairly standard fantasy tropes at play within The Chronicles: what makes it work so well are Donaldson's fertile imagination; his blending of European mythology with that of the Orient; his rich vocabulary and confident writing style married to his dark, bleak themes; and, most of all, his creation of Covenant, a thoroughly unique and unlikeable figure who is thrust into a position of power and responsibility that he neither desires nor believes in. Indeed, refusing to accept the regeneration of his nerves when he awakens in the Land, his first act, one of violent, lustful negation, is the rape of Lena, a young Stonedowner girl. From this abhorrent, impulsive response is set in chain a cataclysmic series of events and currents that will play out across the trilogy: notwithstanding the guilt that Covenant bears for this gentle, damaged woman from that point after, if affects his standing as the reincarnation. With his wedding ring revealed as a puissant artifact of White Gold, the source of the Wild Magic that not even Lord Foul can defy, Covenant must make his way to Revelstoke, announce his existence to the High Lords, and undertake to defeat a dark enemy who stands revealed, more and more, as potentially an avatar of the part of Covenant that loathes all that his diseased self has become: a leper, an outcast, unclean, a man who drove the woman who loved him to flee in horror from his disfigured form. Guilt is the primary fuel for this trilogy's engine, and not just as engendered and driving within Covenant himself. It spreads from his malformed extremity like the streams of the Wild Fire he allegedly controls\u2014and in the spectacular Illearth War, the second and strongest of the books, it is revealed that the dread tendrils of corruption may reach even unto such stalwarts as the Giants and the Bloodguard. Things will get messy and nasty ere the great war brewing has been settled by the expulsion of Foul's armies from the stricken realms of the Land.Fortunately for Covenant, at heart he is not a bad man. He pays for his violation, and pays dearly. He also befriends the Giant Saltheart Foamfollower, easily the best character in the trilogy, as well as (High) Lord Mhoram, a lore-rich member of the Revelstoke rulers who has the most understanding of this unusual, six-fingered individual who frequently raves and rages and treats those who strive to assist him with a ragged refusal to believe. And while, in lesser hands, Covenant's distancing from the Land could become a tiresome and overplayed trope, Donaldson incorporates it adeptly within Covenant's diseased life and loss back on Earth, together with his remorse for assaulting Lena and the mounting toll of lives claimed in service to what he supposedly represents and refuses to accept. And then there's Lord Foul, who, right up until that regrettable conclusion, is a wickedly rendered figure, oozing contempt, speaking pure venom, lashing the beings he hates beyond measure with eyes of coruscating despite. Foul is assisted by the Ravers\u2014turiya Herem, moksha Jehannum, samadhi Sheol\u2014a trio of brotherly spirits of a similar bent to their master, seemingly born with an animosity to the living trees of the land, and, through their capacity for possessing fleshly beings, capable of wreaking subtle and long-undetected harm as the Despiser maneuvers Covenant towards that final confrontation. Together with wholly unique creations like the Ur-viles, Demondim, and Waynhim, Donaldson imagined a fantastically inveigling supporting crew for the three books, ones that span a vast period of time within the Land during the interludes when Covenant (at the end of each volume) has found himself returned to his leprous self in our reality. Furthermore, that the entirety of the Land is not, in fact, a richly detailed, heatedly psychological instantiation of the currents that fuel his dreams is something that is never quite settled to the reader's satisfaction. But what matter that kind of truth? Whether figment of the imagination, or Platonically idealized realm of higher earthen existence, the Chronicles, as they unfold across that Land, are fast-moving, fully-fleshed and -formed, and magical, mystical, and marvelous enough to stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre even while enriching everything about it that its fans love and require. IMO, the end result\u2014and including the sequel trilogy\u2014ranks below Tolkien and Wolfe only as the best such type of story I have ever read."}, {"userName": "Jack", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8070402-jack", "userReview": "Existentialist fantasy. Cleverly written. Brutal and dark. That's all you really need to know before tackling these novels. That and the fact that this is one of the finest trilogy's ever penned, period. At a surface level, these fantasy novels would appear as nothing out of the ordinary - outcast get's cast off into a fantasy world, is the only one who can save the land, is destined to destroy great evil threatening it yada yada. But Thomas Covenant is a bitter leper, and refuses to acknowledge the land a real because to do so would lead to the end of his own sanity... It is this manipulation of fantasy conventions that Donaldson employs to creative a novel of intricate paradoxes and intelligent commentaries on how we deal with pain in our lives - and the cost dwelling on our misfortunes. Thomas Covenant is a despicable character, but his plight, and more importantly the lands is a compelling one. Of course, all this wouldn't matter if the story was weak. Lord Foul's Bane (the first of the trilogy) falters a little in this department, it lingers to long on certain aspects, and Covenant is frustrating to the point of wanting to make you throw the book across the room. But it is worth persisting, because the two novels that follow (The Illearth War, The Power that Preserves) are incredible. The scope and charters really come into their own - far from the cliche's that they originally appeared to be. Quite frankly, some of the moments in these two books surpass almost anything else I have ever read, their passion is truly inspiring. The battle scenes that fill the books are also worth mentioning, unique and well written, they surpass many of their peers, putting great wars like those in Lord of the Rings to shame. However, this may not be for everyone. As I said, the first book is weak compared the rest of the trilogy and contains a scene near the start so repulsive that it might deter some readers from persisting. Furthermore, Donaldson's operatic style and elaborate language might also annoy some. Finally, the brutality may be just too much for some readers, at it's darkest moments it will leave you feeling gutted in ways that other fantasy books skimpily don't. In a genre full of happy endings, loveable heroes, simplistic plots and themes no deeper than good and evil \"The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\" sticks out like a sore thumb. It transcends it's genre, and firmly places itself amongst the ranks of one of the greatest series ever written. It might turn some readers off but there is no denying this is nothing short of a masterpiece."}, {"userName": "A.

I read the first novel of his most recent return to the world a few years ago, and found it incredibly thin and dull. I won't read the sequel, but I'm secretly hoping that the original chronicles were as marvelous as I remembered them to be....At the time I read the first trilogy, I'd just re-read Tolkien and was indulging in other high/epic fantasy novelists, which were popular at the time: Feist, Wurtz. MccAffrey, Eddings, Brooks, Weis & Hickman, and a few Forgotten Realms novels. Donaldson, however, felt the freshest and most capable of these writers (outside of Tolkien). The reason was that Donaldson successfully challenged conventions of the high fantasy genre by utilising a true anti-hero as the protagonist. Thomas Covenant isn't just a leper: he's bitter, self-loathing and also loathes society. He has lost all passion for life. His physical condition in a way, is a very vivid representation of his tortured soul. While the other fictional heroes at the time were at heart, good and just, Covenant's values were questionable for the most part. Donaldson handles the leprosy well. His father was a doctor in India who specialised in treating lepers, so the details feel authentic.Yet when Covenant the Leper is thrust into a fantastic world, where his physical scarring and symptoms vanish, he succumbs to the most unforgivable and heinous of acts, and commits rape. How can you support an anti-hero after that? Yet Donaldson manages it, and this bitter, twisted hero makes for one of the great characters of epic fantasy. In a way, I've only seen George RR Martin handle flawed anti-heroes as successfully (Jamie's rise from tossing Bran off the balcony).I'm hoping that these original chronicles are still being read. I'm hoping they haven't dated too much. The details and layers made it far more sophisticated than Eddings and Brooks at the time. I'm also hoping that Donaldson's latest additions to the series aren't reflective of the original novels - but you never know....It's all about blind hope really, so I'm not re-reading the original trilogy just in case it spoils the memories. Recommended for lovers of rich, tapestry-like fantasies with a dark edge."}, {"userName": "Dantalion64", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/843253-dantalion64", "userReview": "Great, amazing books.

If you want your fantasy heroes to be handsome, valorous, strong, and virtuous, go re-read Tolkien.

All you really need to know about this series is that in the 13-page first chapter of the first book, Donaldson uses these words: spavined, desuetude, turgid, condign, gratuitous, dyspeptic, melanoma, immedicable, improvident, lambent, immanence, celerity, preterite, abnegation, carious, and exudation. Now I have a 99th-percentile vocabulary, and it includes a lot of those words, but I know that most readers don't and I am sure that Donaldson was aware of that. Later on, Donaldson chucks in words that aren't even in my two-volume Shorter Oxford Dictionary. Telic, cymar, jerrids, ... In chapter four, I laughed out loud when he wrote, \"A grimace like a clench of intransigence knotted her mien.\" That's just silly. I am convinced that Donaldson wrote at least the first book on a drunken bet. Stir in the repulsive Eeyore of a hero and it's even more likely.

Anti -hero's should be written in a way that the reader develops some shred of empathy or understanding for, otherwise you're left with a story centered around a character that you don't give a damn about.

Honestly, I have admiration for the concept of this series more than I have liking for the actual books. On the one hand, you have a main character who is a complete jackass--probably the first antihero that I ever encountered, now that I think about it. It's not that he doesn't have a reason to be a jackass; he is, after all, battling leprosy. It's that he doesn't do it with any grace, that he doesn't deal with the admittedly bizarre situation that he finds himself in, that he spends every second thinking of himself only, that he has more mood swings than a teenage girl... he's hard to deal with. Add to that Donaldson's swallowing a thesaurus and tendency not to either show nor tell enough, and you'd think you had a disaster on your hands.On the other hand, you have a fascinating premise: the main character is a leper, he's brought into a beautiful, magical world, he's impossibly healed, and he doesn't believe a bit of it. He's the main hope of a group of people who don't, as far as he's concerned, really exist. And those people are the ones that draw me in, make me want to read about them: Lord Mhoram, who is both noble and totally human; Saltheart Foamfollower, the loyal giant who struggles with his desire to turn against what he believes in; Hile Troy, a man from our world who loves the Land more than anything; Bannor, the unsleeping guardsman who constantly saves Covenant's life, much to Covenant's dismay.

So. Lemme vent. Covenant is an almost impossible to like character. He is sick, weak, a rapist, a coward, fearful, disdainful and has almost no care or understanding for other people apart from himself. And that's just the first 70 pages of the book... But, you know, I grew rather fond of him over the course of the first three books. He is a complete anti-hero. First of all, he suffers from leprosy: if there is another way in which to describe a character as \"dirty-from-the-inside\", I know not of it. Second of all, he genuinely rapes a fifteen year old virgin a day after he met her inside of his \"dream\" - this other world called The Land, where the Earth actually heals you. And then throughout the books, people die for him, sacrifice themselves for him, offer him the gift of their own existence, all while he still firmly believes he is dreaming of a fantasy world and it's all inside of his head. It is genuinely difficult to find any sympathy for him: he keeps making stupid mistakes, keeps misunderstanding signs, keeps being a coward over and over and over again. His thought process might just drive you mad. And yet, despite all of this, he is exactly the kind of character I love reading about. He is complex, he fights for his own survival, he makes human mistakes because he is the embodiment of human fear and somehow, takes you through all the important feelings and emotions that humans go through. So yeah, I quite like Thomas Covenant. He's a dick, but I like him. The writing has been hailed to match Tolkien's - I can't agree. Yes, this is an epic fantasy, a classical fantasy, the kind where you have maps at the beginning of the book, but it doesn't touch on the might that \"Lord of the Rings\" bears. It's complex, though not complex enough. And the writing can be at times blunt, though it keeps a steady pace throughout. Is it too long? Maybe. But is any other fantasy saga too long? Probably. All of them contain thousands of pages of story, but that is part of the magic that fantasy books give you: so much world in which to get so absolutely lost. This volume, which contains the first three books, is 1150 pages long, and I have read it in three days. That tells you a lot about my willingness to avoid my responsibilities, as well as how gripping this work still is. I keep wanting to know what's going to happen next. Should you read it? Yes, if you're a fantasy fan: magic and nonexistent lands, Giants and monsters, if all of these things touch your imagination, you maybe should.

I liked it very much. It has big bones, like Tolkein's work, but is more gritty, more morally complex. The main character is a strong anti-hero (something I had not encountered much before), deeply flawed, and the structure of the alter-universe lends itself well to the notion of a free-will world. Like a darker, infinitely more grown-up cousin of The Chronicles of Narnia, this lends itself well to discussion of theology. However, it stands on its own, and you have to look to find that aspect. Upon graduation, I left \"The Land, to those who know it\" in the senior year \"Will and Prophesy\". Sadly, my handwriting was not that great, and it was published as \"The HAND, to those who know it.\" Not the same, even a little.

We don't like the main character, but we're not meant to, we can't really understand the Land because of barriers put up and it's inherent strangeness but then there are the parts that linger, the phrases and ideas, you find yourself mouthing along as Foamfollower repeats \"joy is in the ears that hear\" or Mhoram's dread declaration that \"in dreams i hear him laughing\"the story is reasonably simple, following a bizarre altercation with a beggar Covenant is knocked down by a police car, but wakes up in a place called the Land where a shadowy ominous figure gives him a message, either you can help me now and I'll attack you in 49 years, giving you plenty of time to prepare and still lose, or you can be defeated now by this lesser evil.Covenant believes the whole thing to be a dream at first but later maintains that the Land cannot be real even when it's determined to prove otherwise. But one thing Donaldson never does is actually say whether or not the Land is real or a figment of Covenant's authorial imagination. The Land wants him not to experience guilt, because dear god does he feel guilty for everything, including at one point walking on grass, but to accept that just because he is ill that he is not powerless.The first time you read it it's about the story and you want to slap Covenant and shout at him and say look at the world you're allowing to be destroyed.The second time it's about the twists you missed the first time, Lord Foul's sneaky machinations and the Ravers, the desolation of the Bloodguard \"womanless, ascetic, and old\" and the slow desperation of the Lords, even when you understand Covenant's enforced antipathy.The third time it's about the language, the way he fits words together, although I'll be the first to admit he often uses $10 words when something simple would be just as effective, there is a scene about being left untransmogrified that had me scrabbling for my dictionary, and feeling cheated. It's Elena's \"look of apocalypse\" and the \"sense of wrongness\" and \"joy is in the ears that hear,\" I know why people hate it, I'm not the world's biggest fan of the second series, finding it inferior to this one, and I'm holding off on the third until it's finished, but for once it's not a fantasy book about a perfect hero, or Tolkien and his trees, it's a world we feel the lack of when we close the book.i think it's best to let the book sell itself\" \"We have beauty, too. We call it 'scenery'\"\"'Scenery.'\" Mhoram echoed. \"The word is strange to me--but I do not like the sound.\"Covenant felt oddly shaken, as if he has just looked over his shoulder and found himself standing too close to a precipice. \"It means that beauty is something extra, \" he rasped. \"It's nice, but we can live without it.\"\"Without?\" Mhoram's gaze glittered dangerously.And from behind him Foamfollower breathed in ashtonishment, \"Life without beauty?

Here instead of the usual blas\u00e9 acceptance the hero can't believe what has happened to them and won't believe what has happened to them. The doubt is established that everything might be a figment of the hero's imagination. The author encourages the doubt by having each of the hero's three visits to the fantastical 'The Land' precipitated by an accident in which the hero looses consciousness. This game with the reader was spoiled by the publication of Gilden Fire which was written from the point of view of one of the denizens of 'The Land', but there you go.In addition to the real world character who, reasonably enough, doesn't believe what he's seeing the backdrop features a good creator who can't intervene in his creation without destroying it and is therefore obliged to use the hero, Thomas Covenant, as his tool or champion and the traditional Dark Lord who is trying to destroy everything. This furthers the idea that the whole thing is a figment of the hero's imagination and simply represents two aspects of his personality fighting it out during periods of unconsciousness.In the second volume, Covenant, in addition to having to deal with the adult consequences of his previous visit, is faced by a second person, Hile Troy, who leads an army in defence of the land who is also from our reality.Eventually he sacrifices himself in an interesting way to achieve a Pyrrhic victory. I always rather liked the fate of Hile Troy.In the final volume the evil Dark Lord, namely Lord Foul was defeated and the series was resolved. But then Donaldson brought back Foul to create a second series. But then apparently he was resurrected in two further series of Covenant books. This rather removes the threat of danger or the pleasure of reward from the reading.The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant (The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, #1-3) builds on the first series in an enjoyable way. There's a nice sense of horror and loss finding that the familiar land from the first series has been turned upside down. There are info dumps at Revelstone and in the forest midway there which allow Covenant and the reader to understand what is going on.The original premise was that Covenant and then Avery (reasonably enough) doubted or could not accept the reality of the land. In this series they have to go on a long sea voyage to equally strange new lands in order to gain mystic object to save the day. However by extending the geography of the setting Donaldson seems to me to be removing some of the 'is it real or is it a fantasy' ambiguity.At the end of the second series I feel a bit cheated knowing now that Lord Foul escapes destruction at the end of this book to resurface in a third series of Covenant novels."}, {"userName": "Richard Benoit", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2469271-richard-benoit", "userReview": "When I first read all the glowing reviews for this series, I thought I had found a winner. I purchased all of the first three books of the initial trilogy. I assumed with so many great recommendations I couldn't go wrong. Boy was I wrong! The hero?, Thomas Covenant ( a leper), whines, cries and rages his way thru page after page after page. Covenant is one of the most despicable characters I have ever come upon. A quarter of the way into the book a young, innocent girl of 16 tries to befriend Covenant, takes him to her home to eat and meet her family, and he repays her by losing his temper and raping her. At this point I threw the book down and refused to read anymore. The image of a leper molesting a child was too much for me. After a few days I decided that something must radically change in the plot because the book has so many good reviews. There must be some redeeming change in his character to make him worthy of being the hero. So I decided to read the rest of it. I shouldn't have bothered. Covenant doesn't alter his behavior one bit. He whines, he cries, he argues, he rages. When attacked, his first inclination is to hide and cower. He doesn't find the will to fight until he is so terrified that he loses his temper and slaughters his assailant. And then he's ashamed of himself rages some more because he's been forced to kill. I found myself rooting for the bad guys, hoping one of them would lop his head off. That way the story could continue without him in it. I threw the book in the trash along with parts 2 & 3 unread. I won't have that kind of drivel on my bookshelf. Someone might come across it and think I enjoyed it! If you enjoy fantasy that doesn't follow the usual tired and overused plot lines, you should check out a series by Kate Elliot called \"Crown Of Stars\".

Now I finally have.It begins well, with the unlikely protagonist Thomas Covenant -- a best-selling author fallen victim to leprosy who is thrown into a parallel world -- arriving in the Land, a place that cannot possibly exist and which Covenant refuses to take seriously. The Land is introduced to us as a mystic, magic and half-intangible place, setting a melancholy mood that is very appealing to me. However, as the story of the first book unfolds, the Land begins to take on the shape of any fantasy world in the tradition of Tolkien. There are points where the similarities between the Land and Tolkien's Middle Earth are on the verge of plagiarism. Such dismissals are highly unfair, however, because firstly the similarities are mostly in the \"literary props\" used by Donaldson to tell the story of the character of Thomas Covenant, and secondly because Donaldson clearly builds on his own ideas. Stephen Donaldson is not telling the story of the Ring of power. The white gold ring, the Staff of Law, the Illearth Stone, and indeed the entire Land itself are only the backdrop to the story of Thomas Covenants inner struggles.The underlying idea for the story is good and original, but unfortunately any good idea has to be transformed into prose for a book to be written and read, and Donaldson is not quite up to the challenge. There are many points that may be discussed, but in order not to repeat Donaldson's principal mistake and make my own telling too long, I will just mention those things that matter most: The story is rather long and slow at many points and of rather average quality, but here and there are a few chapters that are simply brilliant, where all of a sudden Donaldson's flowery, unwieldy and long-winded language suddenly works. The key feature of Covenant's character is his disbelief in the reality of the Land. Unfortunately Donaldson won't let his reader share this unbelief, but rather goes on to tell his story from points of view that make sense only if the reader decides that the Land is really real, and not a figment of Covenant's imagination. This ruins the illusion for me, and makes Covenant a rather less interesting anti-hero. Over all, character development, while present, doesn't always match the pace of the story. This all boils down to two things: the story is much too long, and it is told in a rather too fancy language, which seems contrived rather than poetic.These books might have been brilliant if Donaldson had made the story one third of the length, and if he had allowed himself a somewhat more conversant English. If you are a fantasy fan, then by all means do read these classic books, but if you are just looking for a good piece of fantasy, then I'd suggest taking a look at for example Ursula K. LeGuin's stories about Earthsea instead."}, {"userName": "Jimmi Zito", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9159674-jimmi-zito", "userReview": "I cannot say enough good things about this series. From beginning to end the series does not disappoint. I am looking forward to the conclusion of the series.A word of caution though. This is a dark series, and it is extremely hard to read at times. It will make you angry, I mean really angry. This is not just a story of one man against evil, this is a story about redemption. The main character again, and again tries to overcome and make-up for unspeakable acts of violence that he himself has performed. These books will startle you with both their power and their wisdom.

I love Thomas - I love that he is flawed and selfish and horrible at times, you can appreciate where all that comes from and it makes the story.

It had been about 25 years since reading the first Chronicles and I had forgotten just how good these books are. First on stories themselves followed by the audiobook.Covenant is the ultimate Anti-hero. There are some that come close (Croaker in Glen Cooks the Black company series) but nothing quite as low. Quite simply Covenant in the first three novels is nothing short of a class A ass hole. He's damaged severely by his illness...mentally and he does mental jujitsu to make sense of what is happening to him.But....the character is the basis for the entire series and touches on some very basic questions concerning the nature of reality and ethics which is a hell of a lot more than a lot of modern typical hack and slash fantasy. If you have not read or listened to it I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it. Get past the first 50 pages in the first book \"Lord Foul's Bane\", stick it out and look at the situation from the perspective of the main character. You HAVE to look at it that way because he is just as befuddled as to what the hell is going on as you are, otherwise it's easy after 30 or so pages to chuck the book across the room.....DON'T DO IT. Now...as for the Audio book...It's amazing how many people disregard audio books. This is probably because up until recently for the most part they were dry recitals. Fact of the matter is, an audio book is essentially an audio performance. Qualitatively it's not the same as reading. You would no more think that two different productions of Shakespere were such that if you saw one you would not want to see another than you would an audiobook vs reading (yes, audio is closer to reading somewhat but my point still stands). I was first exposed to Scott Brick after listening to the ENTIRE catalogue of the Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow series of books by Orson Scott Card. Scott does..well a simply incredible job. I was curious as to how well he would be able to pull off the persona of Thomas Covenant and quite frankly I can't imagine Covenant sounding like anything else after the listen. Hope that helpsAnd yes...I said almost NOTHING about the actual Plot except it's about some guy named \"Thomas Covenant\". That is as it should be. If I said anything about it it would ruin it. :)"}, {"userName": "Ron Ecklebarger", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23399117-ron-ecklebarger", "userReview": "Thomas Covenant had leprosy. We don\u2019t hear a lot about leprosy these days, but the mere sound of the word still conjures up images of deformed and mangled flesh. What leprosy does is kill the nerve endings so you lose all feeling. When you can\u2019t feel pain, you can easily overlook a small injury, which can then become infected and cause big problems. That is how he lost his right pinky and ring finger. Such was the reality of Covenant\u2019s life.Even though the progress of his disease was halted and he was not really contagious, he was shunned by everyone around. Even his wife, who knew the facts, couldn\u2019t handle the thought of raising their young son with a leper, so she took the boy and left. As the story opens we find a solitary man whose body feels nothing and whose spirit and soul have become deadened as well. His focus is survival, and while he is alive, few would call it living. He is simply existing.Out of this isolated existence, Covenant is summoned to The Land. It is another world so full of life that even his dead nerves are rejuvenated. In addition to coping with his physical healing, his missing fingers make him a dead ringer for the Land\u2019s mythic hero. To top it off, his white gold wedding ring is a talisman of enormous power and everyone expects him to save The Land from Lord Foul. All this is more than Covenant can handle. Any one of us would question our sanity if we woke up in another world, but Covenant was already on the edge. The only way he can keep from going off the deep end is to deny it all \u2013 it is only a dream. Hence his moniker, Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever.I first read these books as a teen in the early \u201880s. I read them again last year. Donaldson does a magnificent job creating another world. By the end, you can almost believe the land is real, whether Covenant does or not. I think his greatest creation, however, are the characters. You will grow to really care about what happens to them and their home. Against that backdrop is Thomas Covenant \u2013 one messy guy. You will feel Covenant\u2019s pain and understand his stugle, and yet you will also want him to get his act together since he is The Land\u2019s only hope. He is not quite an anti-hero, but he certainly finds about every way possible to screw-up his new life in The Land.Will he manage to get a grip on himself long enough to save The Land? You\u2019ll have to read and find out."}, {"userName": "Jack", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34984449-jack", "userReview": "Is without doubt my favourite series of books and this is where it all began. It was my brother who first recommended the book to me and insisted that I read it straight away. Is the only book where as I was reading it I felt like the boy, Bastian in 'The Never ending Story'. From the first to the last page I was in The Land. Without waffling on about how amazing Donaldson is as a writer and how criminally underrated his books are, I will share my view on the positives and negatives(I even like the negatives) of this omnibus of books. Firstly;Positives1) Strong world-building. Manages to blend fantastical ideas that seem plausible and unified in the world.2) Gripping story. Feels truly heavy in the weight of some of the consequences throughout the book. Many twists in the plot that I didn't see coming. 3) Memorable and interesting characters that don't just feel like templates that blur into each other. 4) Doesn't stray into adolescent tendencies like many fantasy authors are guilty of. Also has plenty of subliminal sub-texts that enriched the depth of the book. Have recommended this book to non-fantasy readers who have enjoyed it.Negatives1) As is often mentioned Donaldson can go on and on with internal monologue, sometimes to the detriment of the pacing of the book.2) Since this is really three books, the book looks like a tome. Not something that is unfamiliar however to the seasoned epic fantasy reader.3) The main character 'Thomas Covenant' is like Marmite, as you have probably heard. Could have been played by Charlton Heston/Willem Defoe in a film version I always felt.4) Don't read this book if you like humour in your writing. Is on the serious, end of the universe kinda vibe.Finally, I cannot recommend this book and the following books enough. Is a shame that people feel the need to compare Donaldson to Tolkien so much because of the use of a ring. I personally think that he surpasses Tolkien with this series of books. If you are a fan of epic fantasy you must read this essential book.

I picked it up after reading somewhere that the main character is not the usual shiny hero type, but, as it turned out, a half-mad leper sometimes so arrogant you want to smack him. But that is the point. As the Chosen One Thomas Covenant is a Stu of sorts, but also human enough with all his flaws and madness that the reader can feel actual sympathy towards him. I'm giving minus points to this book due to its quite uninteresting ending, but elsewise I may re-read it sometime later due to all the complex twists of the fantasy realm.I'm convinced that there's a strong streak of black humor underlying the story. In its essence it's dark and depressing, yet littered with characters one might encounter in a Saturday morning cartoon (Drool Rockworm!).
