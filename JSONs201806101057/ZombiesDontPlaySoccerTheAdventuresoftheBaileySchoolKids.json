They are funny with a just hint of scary and always offer a good mystery for young readers. These books are good for children who are just beginning with chapter books as well as those who just enjoy a good mystery. This one in particular was a favorite of mine because it was about soccer (which I love), but the series covers a wide range of topics that could appeal to any young reader."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1336054-michelle", "userReview": "My daugter LOVES the Bailey School Kids series. This is the only book from the series that I, personally, have read. It was cute, and definitely humorous, although some of the humor was lost on my 7 year old. Definitely not the same quality literature as \"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane\" or \"Ella Enchanted\". But, this is a fun series of books for elementary age kids, and worth letting them enjoy."}, {"userName": "Catherine Woodman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5912889-catherine-woodman", "userReview": "The Bailey School Kids is a best-selling children's book series by Marcia Thornton Jones and Debbie Dadey. Its main characters are a group of four children (Eddie, Howie, Liza, Melody) who suspect some persons in the stories are popular folk lore or fairy tale characters. They are appealing because they mix a familiar story in with this group of kids.

That is why I chose to read this book. I don't remember reading this book, in particular, as a child and that is another reason that I chose it and because soccer is my favorite sport. This book is a good book to read for young children. The book teaches a good lesson on teamwork and helping each other be the best they can be. I would read this book to my class to help them understand the concept of teamwork and helping each other."}, {"userName": "\u2727 Kimberly \u2727", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10172527-kimberly", "userReview": "The collection of \"The adventures of the Bailey School Kids\" stories are among my all-time favorite children's books. Witty, mischievous and fun, these short and silly books continue to bring giggles to the young and old. Just as I have enjoyed them as a kid, my own children also love them today. I even catch myself re-reading them (alone) from time to time. What can I say? I guess I'll always be a BSK kid at heart."}, {"userName": "Jerome", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7672919-jerome", "userReview": "The Bailey School soccer team sucks, so a new instructor is hired to whip them into shape. Coach Graves walks and talks like a zombie, and he appears to live in a graveyard. Graves\u2019s coaching style is also rigorous and the players frequently complain of being worked to death. At one point, a mysterious old woman is seen arguing with Graves, who afterwards becomes numb and is seen staring into space a lot. Adventurous, funny, and enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Isha B.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42891988-isha-b", "userReview": "he Bailey School Kids is a series of Books.
