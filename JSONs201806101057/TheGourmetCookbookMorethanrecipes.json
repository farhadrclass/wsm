These tend to be the same woman that pride themselves in their lack of interest in sex with theirs husbands and can recall for you (whether it is requested or not) the details of Survivor, American Idol, Lost, and America's Next Top Model and, ironically, any and every cooking show out there in great detail.So, I'm not one of those woman. I mean i'm not a great cook but i enjoy it for the most part. If you new me in my high school maybe you were invited to one of Tricia and my naively (and successfully) hosted dinner parties where we served such ridiculous things as stuffed quail 12-14 people at once, if we met in college there was a good chance I made bagels for you at some point, if you knew me when i was first married you most likely had pizza with one of 5 different types of crust at my house at some point. But if you've met me within the past 2 or 3 years you've probably only had the misfortune to be slapped a glob of melted cheese between a tortilla and told to \"help yourself\" to whatever else you could find in my refrigerator. when did this happen? when did i decide i, too couldn't cook or that it wasn't worth the effort? oh ya. right about the time i got divorced and decided i was a miserable failure at everything. I can even recall some self talk that led me to the conclusion that i shouldn't bother. the fact that i can't make up my own recipes or adjust recipes on a whim, seemed like clear enough evidence that melted cheese in a tortilla was all I was cut out for.But then! holy shit! i look up at my kitchen bookshelf and remembered it was lined with these lovely books full of recipes, that it's OK if i can't make it up or adjust it and yes, I may be a little less than detail oriented and i might possibly skip or misread something here or there. I might accidentally use habenero's instead of jalepeno's (rendering the frijollas alla chara inedible) or i might put in 2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes instead of 2 teaspoons in the dry cooked beans (rendering it inedible) and it's true that I recently didn't check the lid on the pepper shaker at Sarah's and dumped an entire shaker of pepper in the barley mushroom soup (rendering it inedible) but still, I'm communing with my food again and I'm Loving it (inedible or not).oh, ya and the book. THIS cookbook. it's awesome. I mean its all sunshiny yellow and happy looking and the recipes are yum-a-licious and while you might not have 5 days to make morrocan style preserved lemons for the Israeli Couscous with roasted Butternut Squash and Preserved lemons but there are sooooooooo many other recipes, EASY ones like the sesame peanut noodles. mmmmmmmmm!!!So....who's coming for dinner? because I'M COOKING!"}, {"userName": "Steven Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1677868-steven-peterson", "userReview": "An interesting concept. . . . \"Gourmet\" magazine's \"greatest hits\" among recipes put together in a large compendium (recipes end on page 935). There is also a DVD that features the author's cooking techniques and some recipes. There are some nice features to this work, including \"Tips and Techniques\" (e.g., using salt and pepper, toasting spices, and handling chiles), a glossary (with a variety of chiles, fleur de sel, miso, truffle oil), and where to get certain ingredients and cooking supplies (e.g., where would you go to get buffalo or Thai basil?). But, of course, the heart of the book is its recipes.The team involved in preparing this book had the following purpose and method (Page xii): \"The concept was straightforward: we would look thro0ugh all the recipes we had ever published, select the best, and retest them. Then we would gather the cream of the crop into a book.\" I would note that some of these recipes are such that I will not try them (e.g., difficult cooking techniques or difficulty in finding key ingredients), but a large number of these are accessible to people who enjoy cooking their own meals. As such, this is a repository of recipes that are apt to be tastier and lusher than those from my beloved copy of \"The Joy of Cooking.\" On the other hand, recipes are often more taxing on the amateur than are those in \"Joy.\" As they say, a tradeoff. Nonetheless, many, many of these recipes are quite doable. . . .The book is divided into a number of sections--Hors d'ouevres and first courses, Soups, Salads, Sandwiches and pizzas, Pasta (and noodles and dumplings), Grains and beans, Poultry, Beef (and weal and pork and lamb), Breads and crackers, Breakfast and brunch, Cookies (bars and confections), Cakes, Pies (tarts and pastries), Fruit desserts, Puddings (and custards, mousses, and souffl\u00e9s), Frozen desserts and sweet sauces, Sauces and salsas, Relishes (and chutneys and pickles and preserves), and Basics. One of the nice things is the recognition in this volume of Americans' changing tastes. For instance, salsa is relatively recent in \"Gourmet.\" By going over decades of recipes, one gets a sense of the changing nature of American tastes.A word about \"Basics,\" the past set of recipes in this work. Here, we see how to create the fundamental elements in cooking, such as stocks (chicken, beef, veal, fish, and vegetable), herbes de Provence (their recipe doesn't include lavender, but it would be easy enough to add), garam masala, and clarified butter (I have recently discovered how easy this is to make and what a difference it makes!).There are so many worthy recipes that it makes little sense to try to enumerate some favorites or ones that I intend to make. However, perusing these makes it clear that while some will be challenging for the amateur cook, others are quite within the reach of such an audience--with the promise of some great tasting dishes!Anyhow, a fine resource and one that I will be using in tandem with a precious few of my cookbooks that are workhorses in my kitchen library. . . ."}, {"userName": "Cyndi J", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1632975-cyndi-j", "userReview": "This is a great cookbook - but THERE ARE NO PICTURES!

My only complaint about this cookbook is that the color they chose for the recipe titles is so hard to read that it really compromises the utility of the cookbook, but the recipes are outstanding, and this is a general cookbook that would be an excellent cookbook if you only had two or three--with the Joy of Cooking, and How to Cook Everything, as well as the Cook's Illustrated cookbook, you would be able to cook enough variety and be modern enough to manage. I think Ruth Reichl has made good cooking available to everyone, and she has spread the word about good food and good food preparation her while adult life--Gourmet was lucky to have her, and I am sad to see the magazine go down.

Gourmet has a reputation to maintain, and Ruth Reichl is a good steward of that rep, while introducing innovation. The other great thing is that the recipes are precise. You never find any annoying reference to, say, \"juice of one lemon,\" which is exactly the kind of thing that drives me insane (juice of one lemon can be one to three tablespoons, guys. Ingredients and techniques are precise. You can expect your version to turn out like theirs. Then you can go ahead and mess with the ingredients on your own. It's become one of my favorite cookbooks. Some stellar recipes: the green-bean tomato salad with pumkin seed-cilantro sauce, muhammara, lentil-bulgur salad, and the walnut-cranberry tart. Oh yeah, and the Moroccan preserved lemons. A jar of those keeps forever in the fridge and you can add them to all sorts of things.

I know the light yellow print wasn't the best choice for the book, because it is hard to see, and some of the recipes can be intimidating. However, I'm an intermediate cook and I use this book all the time. The Pumpkin Apple Bread is awesome, and both my parents and in-laws love it. I gave loaves of it out for Christmas (very little money means baking presents instead of buying) and everyone raved, asking for the recipe. The Irish Soda bread was delicious in a unique way. The Sweet Potato Latkes were okay, though not extra special. The Mashed Potatoe recipes are great, and I'm glad they tell you to use a masher instead of an electric mixer. The book points out that using the mixer releases too much of the starch.I wasn't fond of the Moussaka and Stuffed Grape Leaves, but that's because I found out I don't like eggplant or grape leaves.

I took it out of the library and it weighs about 40 tons but it was worth lugging it home. Reichl, the editor (maybe former?) of Gourmet magazine writes entertainingly. I have read some of her previous books and enjoyed each one. In this hefty tome, she presents lots of interesting and well-researched recipes that have either stood the test of time or are made with now readily available and more exotic ingredients in a delicious way. My only complaint about this book is that the title of each recipe is printed in yellow on white pages and I had a devil of a time seeing them (I'm an old lady; I need things printed clearly). If you enjoy reading cookbooks, I think you'll love this one.

Then I have to describe it. This isn't any gourmet cookbook, this is a compendium of recipes culled from sixty years of Gourmet magazine's finest. My copy is battered, wine-spattered, laced with flour and sugar, and covered with notes. Everything that I've cooked from this cookbook has been delicious. I'm curious about what the DVD offers (I bought mine when it was first published, sans DVD), but doubt that it's necessary. According to the editor, Ruth Reichl, \"Our goal was to give you a book with every recipe you would ever want.\" With the exception of a recipe for chicken enchiladas (how, dear God, could they omit that?!? guess I'll use my old standby), they delivered exactly that."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1972200-stephanie", "userReview": "Another huge cookbook on my shelf at home, I received this from an event that I went to where I got to meet Ruth Reichl and get the book signed by her. It was definitely a great experience. I've made some recipes in here which have come out to be delicious. Though, I do think the recipes are a little more difficult with ingredients that are harder to find. It's definitely not for a beginner cook.There are great sections in the book where they discuss different cuts of meat and various different fruits and vegetables but overall, I think it's more for a medium to advanced level cook.

The pizza crust is ok but really it's about the same taste as a very basic pizza dough that doesn't require you to only pull (not roll) out the dough. The sugar cookies are again ok but nothing that distinguishes them from another recipe.

I didn't believe her...if there's such a thing as bad birthday cake, this was it).

To create this landmark cookbook, editor in chief and celebrated authority Ruth Reichl and her staff sifted through more than 50,000 recipes. Many were developed exclusively for Gourmet's test kitchens. Others came from renowned food writers and chefs and from the magazine's far-flung readers. Then the editors embarked on an extraordinary series of cook-offs to find the most unforgettable dishes, testing and retesting each one to ensure impeccable results. This collection, the only one of its kind, spans a vast range of cultures and cuisines.
