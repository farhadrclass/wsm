My word! This addictive book was one helluva thriller, pace perfect it pulls you in and just doesn't let you go - I didn't want it to end and wished there had been more! There was layer upon layer of plot lines, fantastic breakneck speed twists and turns and an phenomenal ending that after having had you so tense had me emotionally wrecked! I SO loved the main characters Will Klein and 'Squares' - I could see my favourite characters Win and Myron in them which made me so happy! Even a visit from Hester Crimstein - brilliant! And as for 'Ghost' - I don't think a baddie has had me so creeped out since Hannibal Lecter! I wish I could give this more than 5 stars - Harlan just keeps on coming with fantastic books and plot lines - I don't know where he gets them from - but wow! this is definitely one of my favourite by Harlan (and I think I say that every time haha!). I highly recommend this book, if you've never read anything by Harlan before I urge you to start now you won't be disappointed - you'll be hooked and with so many books to read by him you'll have plenty to keep you reading! A HUGE 5 stars!!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30940542-mandy", "userReview": "HOLY FREAKIN MOLY! This book was beyond superb. I can't even find the words for it. Phenomenal! Coben holds your interest from the first to the last word. Every chapter revealed another layer that was peeled, revealing some startling discovery. Absolutely one of my favorite novels by Coben. He is by far, the best author around. Highly recommend this novel!!! Get it and read it! NOW!!!!!!!

Most of the chapters were nice and short with most having some type of revelation to keep you interested and wanting to keep turning those pages. The plot was filled with lots of twists at a surprising speed that kept me totally engaged in what I was reading. I found that it was so entertaining and fast-paced that I didn't even want to guess the outcome even though I can now see that we were given a few clues. I thought that I was given enough information on each character that it was easy to follow along with them and the storyline. Will Klein was my favourite character as I felt for him and was rooting for him. HARLAN COBEN actually made me feel that Will was talking directly to me, the reader!This book was chosen to read by me solely on who the author was. Cover, title and synopsis did not come into play on this read.To wrap it up it was an entertaining, enjoyable, quick and easy, fast-paced, and interesting mystery with a very satisfying ending. Would recommend!!http://www.twogirlslostinacouleereadi..."}, {"userName": "D.

I can feel the damage being done to my brain as I read page after implausible page and I wince at phrase after ham-handed phrase but still I keep going. As McDonalds is to one's arteries so is Coben to ones brain.

I was astounded how these books started off the same with the main character making an assumption that the death person is still alive. While Tell No One packs with action and gutwrenching scenes, Gone for Good is full of drama and heartbreaking stories. I enjoyed Gone for Good since the first few chapters, but after various characters come out of nowhere, I got the feeling that this book was hard to concentrate about who each one is or who takes a part in the crime. Can't deny that Coben is a smart writer, he hid the evidences in the evidences, and the twists were likewise profound and cruel that made me frown so many times.\nThe Ghost stood. \"I didn't come back for revenge or even justice,\"\nWill Klein is my favorite character, it was fun to hear what he knows. His thought is not messy, and his sympathy for other people gives this book a family vibe at the same time. Ken Klein is also an interesting one, even he doesn't take many parts in this book, it still intrigued me when Will thinks of his brother and wholeheartedly hope that he's still alive.\nBut why 3 stars ?\nAs I said, this book is very much alike Tell No One but lacks of action scenes. Although that's not the problem for me, the problem is the characters are too much and they made me confused. Some characters just pop up and disappear, I am so curious that it would be better if Coben limited his characters as few as possible. And the ending was just so-so, not mind-blowing like Tell No One.By the way, it's a great read for me. I have many of his books on my shelves right now.https://goo.gl/XyvWNf"}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "FROM THE BLURBAs a boy, Will Klein had a hero: his older brother, Ken. Then, on a warm suburban night in the Kleins\u2019 affluent New Jersey neighborhood, a young woman\u2014a girl Will had once loved\u2014was found brutally murdered in her family\u2019s basement. The prime suspect: Ken Klein. With the evidence against him overwhelming, Ken simply vanished. And when his shattered family never heard from Ken again, they were sure he was gone for good.Now eleven years have passed. Will has found proof that Ken is alive. And this is just the first in a series of stunning revelations as Will is forced to confront startling truths about his brother\u2014and himself. As a violent mystery unwinds around him, Will knows that he must press his search all the way to the end. Because the most powerful surprises are yet to come.As the author says,  ...the thing about clich\u00e9s is that they're dead on. I can so live with that. Some of them made good sense in this book.I loveeeeeeed this murder mystery, suspense thriller. Messing around with the sleuthing readers, the author knew where to pull the punches to get us disorientated and lost on the wrong tracks of facts. Surprise after surprise! Oh myyyyyy, it was brilliant.Trivial things delighted me, such as the normalcy of their lives. They engaged in ordinary things, eating salads, cheese omelettes, home or french fries, and enjoy venti iced latt\u00e9s or frappuccinos. It was necessary to escape the stark reality of murder, betrayal, revenge and destroyed lives. Ken Klein had been the fiery tennis player, John Asselta the psycho wrestler, McGuane the wow-'em charmer and student council president. Three friends, natives and products from the Livingston suburb, New Jersey. Popular, intelligent, ambitious. Whatever could go wrong in these three friends' lives, when the well-watered lawns, split-level constructed homes, Little Leagues, soccer moms, piano lessons, Four Squares courts, and parent-teacher conferences, acted as some sort of wolfsbane to supposedly ward of evil?Evil was suppose to manifest in jails, where a melting pot of people were captured: a potpourri of inhumanity that inhabits this mini-United Nations. Ten different languages could be heard at the same time. There were shades of skin color that could inspire the people at Crayola. There were baseball caps and turbans and toupees and even a fez. Into this Crayola of colorful cultures, characters such as Yogi Squares the Yoga guru could be found. And Sheila, Nora, Katy, Wanda, Agents Fisher and Joey Pistillo. A place like Covenant house could exist where young teenagers were safely rescued from the streets.All of them had their stories to tell. A twist of fate brought them all together in the hunt for truth and reconciliation. Some lost. Some won. Nobody walked away unscathed. \n\"The ugliest of truths, in the end, was still better than the prettiest of lies.\"\nA fantastic read! It was as much an emotional fairground parade as it was a Bruce Springsteen concert of mayhem and revolt. Even the reader got caught up in the fast moving rhythms of a mesmerized trance. The suspense was that good. The ending amazing."}, {"userName": "\u09b8\u09be\u09b2\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09b9\u0995", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24175715", "userReview": "\u0998\u09cb\u09b2 \u0996\u09c7\u09df\u09c7\u099b\u09c7\u09a8 \u0995\u0996\u09a8\u09cb? \u09af\u09a6\u09bf \u09a8\u09be \u0996\u09c7\u09df\u09c7 \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09c7\u09a8, \u09a4\u09be\u09b9\u09b2\u09c7 \u098f\u0987 \u09ac\u0987\u099f\u09be \u09aa\u09dc\u09a4\u09c7 \u09aa\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u09a8\u0964 \u09aa\u09df\u09b8\u09be \u0989\u09b6\u09c1\u09b2 \u09b9\u09ac\u09c7 \u09ac\u09b2\u09c7 \u09a6\u09bf\u099a\u09cd\u099b\u09bf\u0964 \u09b2\u09c7\u0996\u0995 \u098f\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0 \u098f\u0995 \u09a8\u0995 \u0986\u0989\u099f \u09aa\u09be\u099e\u09cd\u099a \u09a6\u09bf\u09a4\u09c7 \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u09a8 \u0986\u09b0 \u09ae\u09be\u09a5\u09be \u0998\u09cb\u09b0\u09be\u09a4\u09c7 \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09ac\u09c7\u0964  \u09a5\u09c3\u09b2\u09be\u09b0 \u099c\u09a8\u09b0\u09be\u09df \u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u09b8\u09ae\u09df\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b8\u09ac\u099a\u09c7\u09df\u09c7 \u09b8\u09c7\u09b0\u09be \u09b2\u09c7\u0996\u0995\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u098f\u0995\u099c\u09a8 \u09b9\u09be\u09b0\u09b2\u09be\u09a8 \u0995\u09cb\u09ac\u09c7\u09a8\u0964 \u09ac\u0987\u09df\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09a5\u09ae \u09b6\u09ac\u09cd\u09a6\u099f\u09be \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u098f\u0995\u09a6\u09ae \u09b6\u09c7\u09b7 \u09b6\u09ac\u09cd\u09a6\u099f\u09be \u09aa\u09b0\u09cd\u09af\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4 \u09ae\u09a8\u09cb\u09af\u09cb\u0997 \u09a7\u09b0\u09c7 \u09b0\u09be\u0996\u09a4\u09c7 \u09ac\u09be\u09a7\u09cd\u09af \u0995\u09b0\u09ac\u09c7\u0964 \u09b2\u09c7\u09df\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0 \u09b2\u09c7\u09df\u09be\u09b0 \u0986\u09b0 \u099f\u09c1\u0987\u09b8\u09cd\u099f \u098f\u09b0 \u0995\u09a5\u09be \u09a8\u09be\u09b9\u09df \u09ac\u09be\u09a6\u0987 \u09a6\u09bf\u09b2\u09be\u09ae\u0964 \u09b8\u09c7\u0987 \u09b8\u09be\u09a5\u09c7 \u0986\u099b\u09c7 \u09a6\u09c1\u09b0\u09cd\u09a6\u09be\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4 \u0995\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09b0\u09c7\u0995\u09cd\u099f\u09be\u09b0 \u09ac\u09bf\u09b2\u09cd\u09a1\u09bf\u0982\u0964  \u098f\u0987 \u09ac\u0987\u09df\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u09df\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a8\u09be\u09ae \u0989\u0987\u09b2\u0964 \u098f\u0997\u09be\u09b0 \u09ac\u099b\u09b0 \u0986\u0997\u09c7 \u09a4\u09be\u09b0 \u09b8\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u0995 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09c7\u09ae\u09bf\u0995\u09be \u0996\u09c1\u09a8 \u09b9\u09df\u09c7 \u09af\u09be\u09df \u09a8\u09bf\u099c\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ac\u09be\u09b8\u09be\u09b0 \u09ac\u09c7\u099c\u09ae\u09c7\u09a8\u09cd\u099f\u09c7\u0964 \u0986\u09b0 \u09b8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09c7\u09b9\u09ad\u09be\u099c\u09a8 \u0986\u09b8\u09be\u09ae\u09c0 \u0995\u09b0\u09be \u09b9\u09df \u0989\u0987\u09b2\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ad\u09be\u0987 \u0995\u09c7\u0987\u09a8\u0995\u09c7\u0964 \u0989\u09a7\u09be\u0993 \u09b9\u09df\u09c7 \u09af\u09be\u09df \u0995\u09c7\u0987\u09a8\u0964 \u09b8\u09ac\u09be\u0987 \u09a7\u09b0\u09c7 \u09a8\u09c7\u09df \u09b8\u09c7\u0993 \u09ae\u09c3\u09a4\u0964 \u0995\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u0995\u09c3\u09a4 \u09b8\u09a4\u09cd\u09af\u099f\u09be \u09b0\u09df\u09c7 \u09af\u09be\u09df \u0985\u09ae\u09c0\u09ae\u09be\u0982\u09b8\u09bf\u09a4\u0964 \u098f\u0997\u09be\u09b0 \u09ac\u099b\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0 \u0989\u0987\u09b2\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09be \u09ae\u09c3\u09a4\u09cd\u09af\u09c1 \u09b6\u09af\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09df \u09ac\u09b2\u09c7 \u09af\u09be\u09a8 \u09af\u09c7 \u09ac\u09c7\u099a\u09c7 \u0986\u099b\u09c7 \u0995\u09c7\u0987\u09a8\u0964 \u0986\u09b0 \u098f\u09b0\u09aa\u09b0\u09c7\u0987 \u0998\u099f\u09a4\u09c7 \u09a5\u09be\u0995\u09c7 \u098f\u0995\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09b0 \u098f\u0995 \u0998\u099f\u09a8\u09be\u0964 \u099c\u09dc\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u09aa\u09b0\u09c7 \u0989\u0987\u09b2\u0964 \u098f\u09b0\u09aa\u09b0 \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7\u0987\u0964 \u0989\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\u09c7\u099c\u09a8\u09be\u09b0 \u09b6\u09c1\u09b0\u09c1\u0964 \u0989\u09a4\u09cd\u09a4\u09b0\u09c7\u09b0 \u0996\u09cb\u099c\u09c7 \u098f\u0995\u09a6\u09ae \u0986\u0995\u09dc\u09c7 \u09a7\u09b0\u09c7\u099b\u09bf\u09b2\u09be\u09ae \u09ac\u0987\u099f\u09be(\u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09c7 \u0990 \u0995\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a1\u09b2 \u0986\u09b0 \u0995\u09bf)\u0964\u0964  \u09af\u09c7 \u0995\u09cb\u09a8 \u0998\u09be\u0997\u09c1 \u09aa\u09be\u09a0\u0995\u0995\u09c7 \u0998\u09cb\u09b2 \u0996\u09be\u0993\u09df\u09be\u09a4\u09c7 \u09b8\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09ae \u098f\u0987 \u09ac\u0987\u099f\u09be\u0964 \u098f\u0995\u099f\u09be\u09a8\u09be \u09aa\u09dc\u09c7 \u09af\u09c7\u09a4\u09c7 \u09ac\u09be\u09a7\u09cd\u09af\u0964 \u09ab\u09c7\u09ad\u09be\u09b0\u09bf\u099f \u09b2\u09bf\u09b8\u09cd\u099f\u09c7 \u09a2\u09c1\u0995\u09c7 \u0997\u09c7\u09b2\u0964 :)"}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "A fun read.

This reads like a tawdry daytime soap opera, but with a higher body count.So, this happened. It wasn't bad, but the new character every chapter and ever-increasing slide into moral turpitude in this Disturbia Hell came across heavy-handed and spectacle driven. There was a decoupage mentality to the reveal of the storyline by pasting on a new \"shocking\" aka wildly stereotypical development. Subtle it is not. There were some great underlying themes like face value, redemption, and sacrifice, but they got lost under the excess of plot and characters. The only thing which sat there sedately was the setting which is only funny because I have family and friends scattered all over New Jersey so Fair Lawn--yep, Livingston-yep. Where's Livingston? Near Nutley. Where's Nutley? Near Livingston.

I didn't hate this. It was good enough entertainment for a couple of days. But I can't recommend it.Characters are one-dimensional. But they almost have to be. Revealing too much of each character wouldn't allow Harlan Coben to change what all the characters are and what they stand for and what they'r emotivated by in the last twenty pages. Seriously, this was one of those novels where a new revelation happens every two pages for the entire span of the last forty pages. No, I'm not a good guy. I'm the bad guy! So am I! So is she! I was just joshing. I'm a good guy! I've been hiding my motivation all along so that I can pull this gun out and shoot the real bad guy! With that said, Coben's plot has a break-neck pace.

Typical of the genre, it is plot rather than character driven. Even the best characters are a bit shallow, and you will have to accept some improbable ones. Dialogue is written well. Otherwise, the writing is simple - if you got through third grade you won't need a dictionary - although after some stretches of short choppy sentences and dangling phrases you might wish for something more mature. There is unnecessary violence and implausibility both of character and event. Again, that seems typical of the genre.The story is fast paced not just because the author uses cliff hanging chapter endings and plot twists. He dribbles out information. First there is a limousine, then a man in the back seat, then a man sitting next to him, then a driver, then the relationship suggesting they are hoods, and then finally they are. You have to turn pages to get this. Another technique is to insert a short chapter of a seemingly unrelated event, an incomplete scene, and leave it to be developed later, maybe much later. Also, Coben will interleave chapters with two or more related plot elements as he develops the story.This is a four star read in the thriller genre - put \"thriller genre\" in bold italics and underline it. The reviewers who did not like this novel, in general, dislike violent thrillers without well developed characters. A few who do read thrillers found the plot too much like Coben's first thriller, TELL NO ONE. I agree with that.TELL NO ONE opened with a juxtaposition of love and tragedy that was well done and grabbed me in the gut, as it did many other reviewers. As I read GONE FOR GOOD, I wanted to feel the relationship between Will and Sheila, but it wasn't there. That disappointed. For me, the ending in TELL NO ONE was, to be diplomatic, moronic. As I read the startling ending of GONE FOR GOOD, it seemed too far over the top, but when I got to the one page epilogue, my stomach settled and I smiled"}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4683881-patrick", "userReview": "The absolute best H.C. novel to date and that's saying something. The plots, subplots, sub-sub plots are endless and will probably keep you guessing. However, I did figure this one out early on haha, then changed my mind a bit later, and then after a while decided on a different direction, and finally found myself out in left-field out of smokes with an empty beer can. What can I say? A very clever story with so many subtle twists and turns, gut wrenching and spine tingling one moment and somber and heartfelt the next. I kinda felt sorry for our protagonist Will (by the way, why are the good guys always named Will?), but he showed he had the testicular fortitude to challenge the evil powers that be which at the time seemed virtually impossible. Moving on back to another protagonist and good guy named Will, this time Will Trent #1 'Triptych' for a second time."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/308988-angie", "userReview": "I just finished this book and I feel like I've gone on a hell of a roller coaster ride without even leaving home. WOW! This book was absolutely incredible! Every time I thought I had it figured out, Coben came up with another twist to make me question my theories or spin them into nothing but complete chaos. The man is absolutely genius when it comes to thinking up plot twists and turns to keeping the reader second-guessing. If you like a book that will keep you guessing all the way to the very last page, then run - don't walk - to your nearest library or book store and get your hands on this book!

Coben is clearly a gifted writer, with a good sense of what it takes to grab your interest and hook you, and then keep you going until the last page .... and then some. However, having started with Tell No One, Gone for Good seemed like a reformulation. Hero is a grieving man whose beloved family member is dead ..... or are they? Check. Psychotic killer using grossly innovative ways to kill? Check. Gung-ho law enforcement types convinced the hero knows more? Check. Fascinating no nonsense side-kick? Check. Toss in a few improbable coincidences and there you go. I would give \"Gone for Good\" three-and-a-half stars because it WAS a really good read, but the plot seemed a bit too similar, and I wish the main characters (in each book) had been a bit-more fleshed out and developed.

I think most authors struggle to pull of writing in the second person but you feel like Harlan's having a conversation with you - the Reader - as you read this book.It's a story with many twists and turns and jut remember that nothing is ever as it seems.Our protagonist has struggled to clear his brother's name for most of his life. His brother has been framed as the killer of a girl he used to love. The police force think his brother's guilty. The local community thinks his brother is guilty. The deceased's family think his brother is guilty. Even his parents harbour doubts about his brother's innocence. Still, Will believes his brother - Kevin Klein - is innocent. His brother goes on the run and for many years, it'd appear his gone for good and never to come back.Will's mother whispers something on her deathbed that sets his world upside down and opens a can of worms.I liked how Harlan made Will Klein so vulnerable. You feel for him and wish him all the best. You wish him well but it seems his best intentions only hurt those around him and lead him to dead ends. Will discovers himself in the end and the truth sets him free.A worthy addition to your library."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5547564-david", "userReview": "Coben takes a good plot and suspense, but taints it with cardboard characters and too much suspension of belief. The humorous first person which I normally love seems to only work part of the time. Will, the protagonist seems to have only two traits: irrationally angry and hopelessly naive (you know, when another character is trying to explain a formulaic plot twist that you as the reader saw through five minutes earlier, but he just can't wrap his head around it.) The only interesting character is one of the antagonists, the Ghost, and even he is dulled down by the end. With the plot and pacing, I might have rated this one higher if I hadn't recently read so many superior books lately, including thrillers.

In this book we meet Will Klein and I found that it didn't take long for me to like him. What also became apparent pretty quickly was that Will Klein is an ordinary bloke. He isn't somebody who can ruthlessly take down bad guys and he isn't a brooding lead character that has an issue with authority. In other words, a welcome change from the ordinary leading male cop type character!The story itself is quite interesting and before long you realise that the disappearance of Will's girlfriend is far from ordinary. There is also the added plot thread that includes the disappearance of Wills brother who is trhe main suspect in the murder of Julie Miller 11 years prior.One of the things that really struck me with the Myron Bolitar series of books was the great characters, this book was no different. Will Klein's friend Squares is a brilliant added character and I found that I would have like to have actually seen more of him in the book. Even with that as a negative this book was still an absolutely brilliant read.Towards the end I found myself reading even quicker and I must say that the last few chapters had many twists and surprises in store which I absolutely loved.

Coben does well to get you invested with the hero, Will, an ordinary, good hearted guy who works in a youth shelter and lives with someone he loves. The shadow over him and his family is the disappearance of his brother Ken nearly a decade before in connection with the murder of Will's ex-girlfriend. Suddenly his current girlfriend splits and violent friends of his brother and the police come to brutally press him in their search for Ken. As Will pursues the mystery, he implausibly overcomes many dangerous situations and each truth he grasps tends to be dashed with successive twists, leaving me feel a bit manipulated. Yet Coben's knack with characters that aren't simply evil incarnate is impessive enough to make me want to give him another try."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3090460-christine", "userReview": "Yet another loved-one-presumed-dead-but-look-may-still-be-alive-and-in-hiding story from Harlan Coben.
