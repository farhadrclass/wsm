Her spectacular singing voice was incomparable. But a traumatic incident created a debilitating phobia that destroyed any dream of pursuing her passion. As an adult, Angelina teaches private voice lessons and takes on a student she recognizes as astonishing, one who possesses the career potential that eluded her. Lisa Forester is that student. Becoming her mentor and friend, she nourishes young Lisa's talent and instills that which escaped Angelina so long ago, the confidence to believe in her own abilities.  Unleashed, the young student's voice launches her on a meteoric rise to stardom. At the height of Lisa's career, however, a life-altering illness surfaces. Because of her love for Lisa, Angelina must now dig deep down inside of herself and face her own fears.  Relying on one another's strength, both women will learn to face their own challenges.

She ends up a respectable voice teacher and finds a student, Lisa, who also has extraordinary talent as a singer. With her help, Lisa blossoms into a star, a world renown sensation. Both mentor and student have a uniquely close relationship throughout the novel which I found endearing. Each helps the other to overcome their fears and reach their full potential. At the peak of Lisa's career however, she is diagnosed with MS, a debilitating illness that strikes people in their prime years. I know because I have the same type of MS as that depicted in this novel. It was very accurately stated but that is because the author herself also has the disease. I was struck with all the accurate details from the day of diagnosis and how you feel to when relapses hit and often symptoms don't go away. I think those of us with the illness sometimes feel not heard or understood because our feelings and our symptoms are often difficult to put into words but this author did a great job with it. Kudos to you and you have every right to be proud for penning this book. It really was a beautiful story, not only one I could relate to, but one others can read and understand as well. Each helps the other to overcome their fears and reach their full potential. 5 stars for my fellow MS friend, Lauren Grossman."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2999262-connie", "userReview": "I chanced upon this book through Facebook. The author, a fellow MSer, had produced and published an intriguing 'trailer' which I spotted on a mutual friend's page.I inquired about the book, 'friended' Lauren in the process, and ordered the book which I am enjoying now that I have worked through all my weightier tomes!Not intending to be a spoiler, let me just say that I was both surprised and pleased to discover how the author deals with the subject matter!This was a quick read by a new author, who has done a good job with her story. At times there were a few too many cliches, and the style a bit too formulaic, but that is probably a result of inexperienced editing, I suspect.Heaven knows that any 'first book' I might publish would likely be laden with shortcomings far more major that are found here!"}, {"userName": "Lauren Grossman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5173729-lauren-grossman", "userReview": "Best book I ever wrote...I mean, read."}, {"userName": "Ramcy Diek, Author", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17748384-ramcy-diek-author", "userReview": "Great book."}, {"userName": "Shelle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4105030-shelle", "userReview": "I loved the theme of this book! I was so excited to \"win\" this book in a giveaway and put it at the top of my reading list (it's the least I could do). From a purely aesthetic viewpoint, I really liked the layout of the chapter with manageable \"stopping points\" with in the chapter and the cover artwork. While I at first thought Angelina was the protagonist of the story, it became equally about both Angelina and Lisa and the amazing interplay of their relationship. While I don't want to give away too much of the plot, it was the element of such likeable characters changing and evolving interdependently and in such a way that draws you into their lives that you're rooting for them to overcome their obstacles. The only minor element that left me wondering about Lisa's credibility was the absence of a male love interest or much about her views on it given her situation. I highly recommend it especially to anyone who knows of someone or who has MS because it has such a human and positive message. Ultimately, it is a story of hope, love, forgiveness, perseverance and acceptance that touches your heart."}, {"userName": "Lynn Hallbrooks", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5633117-lynn-hallbrooks", "userReview": "I'm so glad that I met Ms. Grossman on Independent Authors and Writers. I've followed her blog and learned many things about her as a person. So when I read this book, I could see a little bit of her in the main character. The interesting thing is that you have to finish the book to see which bits are true to her and which are pure fiction.

Lauren has written a true novel, and her character development is excellent, her plot interesting with just enough layers and turns to hold the reader's enduring attention. I agree with the author's statement, that this is a book for all generations of readers. Bravo, Lauren, this is very well done. May I ask you to take a look at mine?

I liked the aspect of showing how someone who is suffering great disappoinment or loss in their life can keep their focus not just on themselves. The author allowed us to see how unselfish love that focused not on loss or bitterness could be considerate of all involved. The fear was real and pulsated into the story. The courage was vivid and well developed. The love was sweet. I also appreciated the part of the story that can remind us as adults how one event that seems \"nothing\" to us can be devastating to a child. Lots of good food for thought. I expect other great reads from Lauren."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1531728-megan", "userReview": "I was very happy to receive this book in a giveaway. I very much enjoyed the idea and the story. The only reason I rated it as \"liked it\" is that it should have been a much longer novel. I really liked the characters and their real emotions. I would have loved to have been able to get into the characters more, to understand Lisa's motivations and life as a superstar better. That being said, for those of you who like a neatly wrapped novel you can read in a shorter time span, I highly recommend it! It's a sweet, sad, and heartwarming tale of love and devotion to ideals and dreams.

Grossman\u2019s blog a few months ago and decided I wanted to read her debut novel. Being a lover of music, this story that uses music in such a wonderful way was right up my alley. The bond between a teacher and a student is one that should be explored as I believe teachers give so much of their time to other people\u2019s children every day of their lives. Grossman creates different sections told by two characters to illustrate how this story has more than one protagonist and uses those sections to explore the major turning points with each. She gives us glimpses into moments of their lives (since the book covers many decades); never spending too much time on the years in between \u2013 but instead getting to the major milestone. Reading the author\u2019s bio of a woman diagnosed with MS in 1993, I applaud her for sharing such a personal story in such a public way (though this book is not autobiographical). Once In Every Generation offers a reader a take on the modern family: where family can be whoever we chose to surround ourselves. In this case: a student and her teacher. If I had any critique, it would be that I wished Ms. Grossman would have made the book into a series of multiple books and really developed those years in between the \u2018moments\u2019 because I think readers would have loved to spend more time with Angelina and Lisa as their relationship was fostered, matured, and blossomed into something well beyond that of a normal teacher and student."}, {"userName": "Scarlett Copperfly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27063035-scarlett-copperfly", "userReview": "I have solemnly come across a character who is so unlikeable from the very beginning. I didn't get over the first chapter before I closed this book again and said \"hell no!\" WHat a waste of money....The main character is arrogant, plain and simple. We're just supposed to believe that her own voice is so so so so phenomenal, like you can't even imagine. A true gift. So amazing. Literally, this beginning is an homage of the character to herself! Then this traumatizing event? She peed her pants while she sang. I get that it's embarrassing for sure. But she acted as if this was the worst thing ever to happen to a child and even 20 years later or so, blames this one unfortunate event for everything she isn't. Shallow, shallow person. But she hasn't lost any of her arrogance because remember how super amazing her voice is? Well because of that she, now a teacher, doesn't take just anyone as her student because hey! Her talent is so amazing, she won't deem just any one good enough to benefit from this phenomenal chance to learn from her. And that's where I stopped reading and tossed the book away. I am not interested in reading about some arrogant teacher who thinks she is too good for this world and can judge any one and is better than anyone. THe sheer nerve of her to claim a voice like hers only comes once in every generation! I hated her from the beginning. That simple."}, {"userName": "Connie N.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3154417-connie-n", "userReview": "Pleasant, sweet, hopeful book. To me, this book is about living up to your potential, taking chances, and moving forward no matter what life throws at you. There's a lot of love and support here, with a strong support group of family members and mentors. It seemed a little over-the-top, but that's OK since it erred more on the positive side, and that was inspiring. Angelina has a fabulous singing voice, but as a young child she had a bad experience on stage, so she's hidden from her talent since then. While teaching voice, she meets Lisa, a very talented singer. When Lisa goes on to fulfill her dreams, Angelina is credited with her success. Unfortunately, at the height of her career, Lisa is diagnosed with MS, which alters her entire life plan.Many reviewers were impressed with the author's knowledge of MS and a person's reactions when diagnosed. Apparently this is due to the fact that Grossman has MS and has dealt with its effects. With no personal experience with this disease, that struck me less than the fact that Lisa continued to find other outlets for her talent, not allowing the disease to cripple her spirit.
