Yes, book dragons, if it\u2019s her books (or Nora Roberts/J.D. Robb), prepare yourself to be mowed over by unrestrained gushiness.That said, I went into this book full of expectations. And you know what they say about expectations? The bigger they are, the harder the fall.It was great to see the characters from Deadmen Walking, their interactions with each other, the fast-paced action, the romance. Add in a new storyline that kept you at the edge of your seat.At 81% of the book, this story was a solid 5 stars for me. I practically had to clutch my belly to keep from bursting out with spoilers left and right because I got to see some of my favorite warriors. Their interactions cracked me up.As from 82% however, my rating sadly suffered a fast descent. The ending happened way too fast without the detailed scenes that are Sherrilyn Kenyon\u2019s trademark. The ending fight scenes were sorely lacking in important details. I was left with the annoying question, how?Yes, this side wins over that side, this side gets the best over that side, but how? The ending scenes were disappointing for me but other than that, the story was pretty good.Posted on Blog"}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43194437-gary", "userReview": "an epic read 5 out of 5 all the way round"}, {"userName": "Megzy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4412443-megzy", "userReview": "3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Scholar", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31025904-scholar", "userReview": "BEFORE RELEASE:Cameron Jack & Kalder Dupree."}, {"userName": "Crazy4Books", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16445884-crazy4books", "userReview": "WHAT I CANT WAIT A YEAR"}, {"userName": "Pamela(AllHoney)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/884792-pamela-allhoney", "userReview": "The second book in the Deadman's Cross series by Sherrilyn Kenyon.

I mean, it good and all, I guess, but I feel like it didn't add much to the series overarching story arc started in book 1, with the gates crashing open and a possible Apocalypse looming over the horizon. Most of the story was about Kalder and Cameron, their backstory, and their burgeoning love, which was all fantastic but feels a little rote at this point. It's not very different from any other couple's love story in the DH Universe. There is some family drama/baggage. Some sort of existential crisis or identity issues are brought up, in the lines of character who have been pretending to be something their not or have acted badly throughout their lives and now wonder who they are. Both main characters struggle with some inner impulse to do bad things, literally conquering their inner demons. Long-lost family members show up...Also, as much as I like each of SK's books, I feel like characters tend to be the same sets of repeated qualities. Typically they are varying degrees of sarcastic, sweet, shy/sheepish, determined/take-no-shit attitude, and gloomy or hopeful. In particular, Kalder and Cameron felt like the 1700s' pirate version of CON's Nick and Kody. Kody/Cameron: angel, strong-willed, hopeful, tender-hearted, literally spreads goodness with hugs. Nick/Kalder: sarcastic, gloomy, demon, take-no-shit attitude. All of them are insecure for some reason or another. I don't know if this is intentional on the part of the author, as a way to show the human qualities that unite us all, but it's getting harder to bond with and care for characters who fail to distinguish themselves from all the other that came before. Kalder and Cameron are great, don't get me wrong, and their story is lovely, but I doubt if I'll remember it a few months from now aside from the few tidbits of pertinent information on Savitar and Thorn that I care a LOT more about."}, {"userName": "Taylah Bromilow", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12476771-taylah-bromilow", "userReview": "Every single time!!

Keeping up with who is what and what is who, etc, I need a \u2018bible\u2019 to be able to reference while reading. And what is the time frame? Sometimes I hear the characters use words that I assume wouldn\u2019t make sense or would not have \u2018existed\u2019 in what I assumed the time is for these books. Note: I also listened to a good portion of this on audible. I really enjoyed the narrator but will say that many of the characters did not sound as I hear them in my head as I read, ha.

The only sad part is the fact that since I received this novel early, I will have to wait an even longer time to read the next installment.\u00a0This book FINALLY focuses on Cameron, and gives her a new love interest, Kalder! I appreciate the fact that these novels actually focus on one couple at a time, as we learn their backstories and they learn each other. It helps me to connect with the characters even more and learn to appreciate their stories.\u00a0Cameron is definitely a worthwhile character, and in this novel, we learn more about her and her brother, and their family life before the seas. She is a strong woman who is determined to set Kalder free and teach him that he deserves kindness.\u00a0Kalder has been hardened against the world for many years after a horrible experience with his family. He doesn't give mercy, nor does he expect any back. He knows that Cameron is not the right woman for him. He doesn't deserve someone so kind and pure. However, Cameron is determined to change his mind, and slowly he falls for her.\u00a0I can't express how much I LOVED this book. A: There are MERPEOPLE. I love merpeople so much, it's not even funny. B: Cameron and Kalder were so sweet to each other, I lived for the romance in this novel. C: The action scenes were even more intense in this novel. This novel scared me a few times, it is definitely a dark fantasy novel. If you read the first one and didn't think it was dark enough, read this one. The scenes\u00a0with Kalder and his brother nearly made me cry.\u00a0The world-building was definitely even better in this novel, and the pacing was perfect. I read this book nearly in two school\u00a0periods or about 2 hours. I was completely drawn in and addicted to this novel. There were no editing errors even though I had an advanced copy, and as a plus, the cover art was beautiful. I have absolutely no complaints about this novel.\u00a0I would recommend this novel to lovers of romance and dark fantasy.\u00a0I received an advanced copy of this novel and this is my voluntary review."}, {"userName": "Michelle Harris", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50952043-michelle-harris", "userReview": "Loved this sequel.

For one thing this happens in the past (so it gets kinda confusing, I have to keep reminding myself that Nick isn't the Malachi in this book in fact he hasn't even been born). Thorn retrieves Kalder from Vine, but they are forced to leave Kalder's younger brother Muerig behind. Upon his return Kalder and Cameron get closer a lot closer. And to everyone's surprise and Thorne and Bane's dismay Vine sends Muerig to the ship. Thorne and Bane suspect that Vine fixed it where both Cameron and Muerig can't stay in the world and that Kalder will be forced to choose between the two. Then the Malachi comes after them and to save everyone he has to take them to his home under the sea (Wyneria). Seems \"Prince\" Kalder has been holding out on everyone his Father was the King of Wyneria. Of course it turns out that Devyl Bane was holding out on him too. Devyl was friends with Kalder's Father and knows that Melusine is his biological Mother and that Melusine loved him a great deal and didn't want to leave him, but was forced too. And that Kalder was suppose to inherit the Kingdom at his Father's death, which is the real reason Bron (his Step-Mother) killed him. In the midst of sorting all this out Muerig betrays them and summons the Malachi (Adrian) they are caught between two armies and losing badly until Kalder using his powers to transport them to Savitar's Island. Much to Savitar's displeasure. We get treated to barbs between Savitar, Thorne and Acheron until the Malachi and Vine shows up again. The Malachi siphons off Kalder's powers, leaving him human and kidnaps Mara (who is pregnant) and Valynda. Melusine shows up and returns Kalder's powers and leaves three rings and the deed to The Black Swan Tavern with Kalder and Cameron and predicts a bright future for her grandson. Kalder and Cameron agree to go with the crew to rescue Mara and Valynda."}, {"userName": "Diane Lynch", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5940440-diane-lynch", "userReview": "Yo Ho Ho, Sherrilyn Kenyon takes no prisoners with DEATH DOESN\u2019T BARGAIN, the second book in the Deadman\u2019s Cross series. The Deadman were given a chance to redeem their soles by being part of Thorn\u2019s Hellchaser army. They are tasked with killing the demons who escaped their prison and threaten mankind. This Historic Fantasy takes place in 1717. It is mermaid, Kalder Dupree\u2019s and Sephirii, Cameron Jack\u2019s story.I made the mistake of reading DEATH DOESN\u2019T BARGAIN without reading book one, DEADMAN WALKING. It took a few chapters for me to get all the characters straight and figure out what was going on. After I did, I loved this story. I want to go back and read book one to find out what I missed.I really enjoyed Kalder\u2019s character. We discover a lot of interesting things about his past and his lineage. He is not all that he appears. He is a good (mer)man, despite his cruel upbringing. He carries a lot of guilt, some of it unwarranted. He is selfless, always putting others before himself. Cameron is an interesting compliment to Kalder. She is sweet, caring, curious, and honest. They have a yin-yang relationship.The Deadman have many interesting adversaries. It keeps the plot exciting. I love that DEATH DOESN\u2019T BARGAIN takes place in the Dark-Hunter Universe, and that characters like Acheron make an appearance in the novel. The story frequently reminded me of a more serious Pirates of the Caribbean. However, it does have its funny moments. As always, Sherrilyn Kenyon\u2019s writing style is exemplary. You feel like you are in the proper time-period. I really liked the epilogue. I am highly anticipating the release of book three, AT DEATH\u2019S DOOR. Followers of Kenyon\u2019s Hunter Legends Series should enjoy this book. Furthermore, people that like pirate fantasies with a paranormal twist.

This romantic fantasy has all kinds of creatures for characters. Each one has its own story with choices made or to be made.Kalder Dupree sacrificed himself for others. He's suffering in hell because of that choice and yet he still fights with everything he has. Kalder's life was never easy. So much loss, grief, and trouble inside of it...it made me wonder how he survived thus far. But his journey isn't over yet...Cameron Jack is a female not to mess with...her determination and strength make her a good protagonist. She's a strong female who knows what she wants. That want is to free Kalder. His sacrifice helped her. Now, she wants to return the favor. Their journey is just beginning...Danger, mystery, and a lot of action are found inside Death Doesn't Bargain. The whole story had a way of captivating my full-attention. There were so many sides to fight that it was interesting. I was not sure which side would do what or when. The suspense and intrigue was on high volume. The ending...I liked it a lot but now, I cannot wait to get my hands on the next title. Sherrilyn Kenyon definitely knows how to enchant readers, lie myself.

This book was so gripping that I had a hard time putting it down. We are back at sea with the deadman and the book opens up with the search for Kalder\u2019s soul which he gave up in the last book to save Cameron and her brother Paden. And the action just increases from there. In true Kenyon fashion the males all have a dark side to them from being kicked on by life. For Kalder it was from his parents and siblings mostly. And his light in the darkness is Cameron who is probably the most unlikely person. What I like about Sherrilyn\u2019s books is that her heroines are so real for being paranormal. They all have the same fears that women do in the real world even though these ones are fighting demons. The story line also ends on a HUGE cliffhanger but the journey is entirely worth it. Also, the audio was superb!! I love Holter Graham and would listen to the man read a repair manual. He is so truly talented in his field that if he stopped narrating the Dark Hunter books I would stop listening to them. His voices are consistent throughout the books and he knows how to read in such a way that sucks you in and doesn\u2019t let go.

After losing Kalder in the last book, the crew is desperate to get him back. Especially Cameron Jack, who Kalder traded places with in hell to set her free. In this novel we learn more about Kalder and his Myrcian heritage. Which is just another awesome mythology that Kenyon has woven into her world of Dark Hunters. And speaking of Dark Hunters, we get a surprise visit from the leader himself. Acheron appears in the story along with Savitar. What I really loved about this story is that we gain more knowledge of this universe Kenyon created, especially when it comes to the Sephirii and the Malachai and the Source. More secrets are revealed when it comes to these creatures and ideas that constantly appear in her Dark Hunter series and with characters like Thorn, we can start piecing everything together a lot better. This part of the story was just as important as Kalder's and Cameron's. Their relationship is one that started in Deadmen Walking and we see really grow in this story. Another great installment to the series, with yet another cliffhanger that has us wishing the next one wasn't a year away!
