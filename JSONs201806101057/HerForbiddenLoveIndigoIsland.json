Dorsey and Jack can't seem to stay away from each other. What happens when news gets out that they are seeing each other? I loved the story.

Jack, another employee, is strongly attracted to her. He helps her learn to love again, but there is something not quite right in this paradise. Will these two find the happiness they desire? I loved this book. This South Carolina Sea Island is a beautiful and romantic setting for this tender romance. It was interesting to have a little of the Gullah culture woven into the story. Dorsey and Jack are compelling characters. They are struggling to deal with the tragedies in their life and move on. Their romance was very satisfying. Kaira Rouda does a wonderful job merging the interwoven story lines so that I understood Dorsey and Jack and how the past influenced their lives.

She gets to work at a world class resort, with children, and, best of all, live far away from the memories that still haunt her every waking moment. However, from the moment she steps off the ferry onto Indigo Island she senses that something just doesn't add up. Her new boss, Steve, is brash, controlling, over familiar, and just down right disturbing. While the resort is top notch and picturesque, the rest of the island feels sad and neglected. Dorsey, just can't shake the feeling that they way things are run here aren't the way things should be.Jack Means has worked hard most of his life to achieve the level of success that is now his...or should be his. Having already signed an employment contract to become the youngest member of management in Top Club history, Jack is disgusted to learn that Steve has pulled a fast one and is denying his admission to this hallowed club until the end of the summer season. Until then Jack must cool his heels for another summer as head lifeguard, but with a twist...the long term employee rules of \"no dating staff\" now apply to him. Too bad the new Children's Program Director seems just too delicious to resist. Can he resist Dorsey all summer? Or will Steve's heavy handed treatment only bring them closer together?This story was a wonderful depiction of Post Traumatic Stress and Suppressed Memories. Lately, as the stigma has slowly been removed from PTSD, more and more examples have been popping up in popular and romantic fiction. This one is a prime example of one method used to combat PTSD, which is meeting your fear head on and acknowledging that you will always have a sensitivity to certain situations. This story allows no sugar coating or \"cures\", just a strong dose of truth that some events cannot ever be forgotten.The characters are certainly memorable. Dorsey and Jack both have a backbone and a lot of guts to face down the myriad of unpleasant events that take place in the book. Steve is beyond a creep. He is one hundred percent EVIL! The supporting staff, guests, and residents of the Island all add a lot of color and excitement to the story.Overall, this is an exciting, if sometimes violent, adventure full of mystery and determination to discover the truth and do the right thing."}, {"userName": "Sue ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1895704-sue", "userReview": "3.5 starsIn Lines In The Sand (An Indigo Island Romance) by Kaira Rouda, Dorsey is starting fresh with a new place to live and new job.

With past secrets and mysteries, will Jack and Dorsey be able to keep their dream jobs and each other? Or will they have to choose?Lines In The Sand is a unique summer read. Kaira's descriptivism of Indigo Island and the ocean will take you there! Jack and Dorsey are characters who are still maturing. Their relationship and interactions demonstrate this well, and their growth is obvious as Lines In The Sand progresses. Their story is fun and I love the setting. The sub plots added some mystery and I loved how Kaira brought in the island culture that is outside of the Inn. Kaira also draw out the mystery of Jack and Dorsey's back grounds enough to keep you very interested and draw you into their lives as they struggle to overcome their pasts. The secondary characters are really catchy and well written into Lines In The Sand. There are a few of them I really looked forward to seeing, and I was very interested to find out what Steve was up to!With a touch of mystery and lots of romance and conflict, I'd recommend Lines In The Sand to romance readers looking for a saucy romantic read."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255640-emma", "userReview": "Lines in the Sand by Kaira RoudaAN INDIGO ISLAND ROMANCE, BOOK 2Stepping off the ferry onto Indigo Island for her new job at Melrose Plantation, Dorsey Pittman is excited to have a fresh start, far from heartbreak and tragedy.

The fact that there is also a Thriller element to this story made the story richer. Like its preceding novel in the series, the main characters are instantly drawn to each other and although they feel deterred by company policy to stay away from each other, Jack and Dorsey quickly decide that Love trumps HR. I really respected this decision, I felt that the \"company policy\" excuse really dragged on too long in \"Weekend With the Tycoon\".

This was a cute story and a fun read. I can't give it full stars for a few reasons. 1. I didn't feel the chemistry between them on the page; the author just told me there was chemistry several times per chapter. 2. The ending felt rushed, forced, possibly even unbelievable. 3. There's a suspense element that resolves in the way you'd pretty much expect. When something happened on the beach (no spoilers), I got excited because I thought the suspense plot was going to fly off the rails into Awesome Town. It didn't. *sad tear* 4.

I found the language a bit forced and the dialogue didn't seem to flow naturally. It was as though Kaira Rouda was trying too hard with everything. It could just be that I am too old for this book. I think it would be a perfect young adult novel. It has a lot going for it in an island resort setting, handsome hero and pretty heroine, difficult backgrounds for them both and a particularly nasty boss, who also happens to be a womaniser. I just couldn't believe that either Jack or Dorsey would take what Steve was dishing up, yet they both sat back and let him walk all over them.
