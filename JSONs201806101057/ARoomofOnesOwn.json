Yes, everyone who told me that, you were absolutely right. It is a little book, but it's quite likely to revitalize you. How many 113 page books and/or hour long lectures (the original format of this text) can say that?This is Woolf's Damn The Man book. It is of course done in an overtly polite British way... until she brings up her fountain pen and stabs them right between the eyes. She manages to make this a work of Romantic sensibility, and yet modern, piercing, and vital. Woolf was asked to give a speech on \"Women and fiction.\" She ended up with an entire philosophy on the creative spirit, though with special attention to that of women, of course. Her thesis is simply that women must have a fixed income (500 pounds a year in her time) and a room of her own with a lock on the door. It is only with independence and solitude that women will finally be free to create, after centuries of being forced to do as men please because they support them, and to work in the middle of a drawing room with a thousand practical interruptions, ten children to see to, and a sheet of blotting paper to cover the shame of wasting her time with \"scribbles,\" (as Jane Austen did whenever someone outside the family came into the room) when there was a house to keep and a family to raise. She also shows the creative powers of women tortured and hidden through the allegory of Shakespeare's sister, who never had a chance to express her genius and killed herself after being defeated at every turn.Woolf takes her readers through the history of women writers, and makes sure that the reader cannot fail to see how brief it is and how limited, and why. Woolf states that all modern women should acknowledge their ancestors who fought for five minutes and a few pieces of paper to jot down lines of Jane Eyre, Middlemarch, or Pride and Prejudice. She makes sure that women know that they can reject the framework and the form down to the very sentences that are given to them by men to find their own voice. However, this voice should be, ultimately, sexless. In her view, one should be \"man-womanly,\" or \"woman-manly,\" to write enduring classics. She doesn't let women down easy, either. The end of the book points out all the advantages young women have(/had, 1929) and yet they still don't run countries, wars, or companies, and there's no excuse for that. It's an exhortation to not squander everything the women's movement fought for. I probably could have said this in a much shorter way: \"Damn the patriarchy, find your own way and your own voice in life, seize the day, just DO something. How dare you waste the opportunities that so many others would have died to have.\"Inspiring words on any topic, I think. I think I'll keep this by my bedside to reach for when I feel discouraged or lazy or bitter about my future or my current situation in life."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32532774-lisa", "userReview": "I can't believe I only read this book now. I would have needed it when I was 18, and 25, and last year and yesterday!The opening sentence caught me, right away:\"But, you may say, we asked you to speak about women and fiction - what has that got to do with a room of one's own?\"I don't even need to read Virginia Woolf's justification before I exclaim:\"EVERYTHING, it has EVERYTHING to do with a room of one's own!\"Whoever loves art, literature, and the act of writing, drawing or reading knows how hard it is to keep the deep concentration necessary to achieve something of relative creative value. If you are constantly in company, then \"casual interruptions\", as Woolf calls them, will eventually make you give up and do something less challenging. Quiet space and time are fundamentally important, and women have been denied both over the course of history. As Woolf is a storyteller, even when she writes nonfiction, she demonstrates the creative process by evoking an afternoon on the riverbank, where she catches a thought just like a fish. A man interrupts, and the thought disappears, never to be found again. She goes on to reflect on the development of literature, and the fact that men historically have produced more works of art than women. Her question throughout the essay is: \"Why is that?\"As she cannot accept the idea that men are physically and mentally stronger (an explanation she hears and finds in reference literature), there must be a different reason, which she sets out to discover. She analyses the traditional gender roles and points out that men have three advantages: money, space, and education. To prove her point, she invents a brilliant sister of Shakespeare's, and assumes that she is equally talented. Woolf creates a storyline for her quest to conquer the literary world of the 16th century just like Shakespeare did in real life, and shows the various stages at which her access to the world are blocked. It is a harsh story, and it illustrates the difference between men's and women's opportunities perfectly.So far so good. Her lovely prose and beautiful literary examples make the argument for equality read like a novel, but I am always a bit cautious when I read political essays. There is so much attached to the question of feminism today that I dare not guess what Virginia Woolf's final suggestion or solution will be. I am almost nervous, as I fear I might stop loving the book when I read the conclusion. But this is where she really surprises me, and where I feel that she has written the book for me specifically. She does not end by delivering a hate speech towards men, and by proclaiming that women should take over their roles and become more like them. She rather insists that women should be given the same freedom to develop their OWN strengths:\"It would be a thousand pities if women wrote like men, or lived like men, or looked like men, for if two sexes are quite inadequate, considering the vastness and variety of the world, how should we manage with one only? Ought not education to bring out and fortify the differences rather than the similarities?\"This is something very close to my heart, and a reason why I struggle with the political feminism of my home country. I have never been able to accept that I must strive to be the SAME as a man, rather than to have the same basic opportunities to develop in my own way. I have never understood why we try to impose masculine ideals on women instead of creating an environment of respect for feminine strengths - and I remember being extremely angry at a pre-school for banning the doll's house from the playroom so that girls wouldn't adopt typical \"girly\" behaviour. I found that insulting. What about cars, then? Considered boy's toys, and therefore acceptable? The same goes for the pinkophobia that some parents develop to protect their girls from looking too feminine. It is a colour, just like blue? And why is it politically loaded, if blue is not? Are they not making the point that the things girls choose are less valuable?I am in deep waters now, I realise, so I will return to why Virginia Woolf is such a role model and heroine for me. She sees human beings in their multifaceted identities, and claims, rightly in my opinion, that any creative person must be able to draw from male AND female parts of the mind:\"Some collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before the art of creation can be accomplished. Some marriage of opposites has to be consummated. The whole of the mind must lie wide open if we are to get the sense that the writer is communicating his experience with perfect fullness. There must be freedom and there must be peace.\"This is by far the best essay on gender equality I have read, as it respects and values the individual wishes and needs of women (and men) and does not try to create (by force) a uniform sameness. At the same time, it is a declaration of love to literature and creativity. It is entertaining, funny and informative. It has it all! I want more Virginia Woolf!Favourite quote:\"For books continue each other, in spite of our habit of judging them separately.\""}, {"userName": "Trevor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor", "userReview": "There are so many books that one \u2018just knows\u2019 what they are going to be about. I have always \u2018known\u2019 about this book and \u2018knew\u2019 what it would be about. Feminist rant, right? Oh, these people do so preach to the choir, don\u2019t they? Why do they hate men so much? In the end they are no different to the male chauvinists they are attacking. Why can\u2019t they just be more even handed?That none of this is the case, of course, does not matter at all, because reiterating received wisdom seems to be all that is necessary today \u2013 read 99% of the critiques of The God Delusion and the horrifying thing you will find is either a mindless acceptance or a mindless rejection of Dawkins. It is enough to fill me with near complete despair.The blurb on the back of the Penguin edition of this book says that this is \u201cone of the greatest feminist polemics of the century\u201d. There is a quote too from Hermione Lee (apparently, Woolf\u2019s greatest biographer) which reads, \u201cfierce, energetic, humourous\u201d. Look, I really loved this book and would recommend it whole-heartedly \u2013 but it is none of those things.A polemic is a strong verbal or written attack \u2013 to say this book is even an attack is really stretching the friendship. This is the most mild of books. Its central argument is that women need money of their own and a room of their own, with a lock on the door, if they want to write. How can one really be \u2018fierce\u2019 if that is all one is going to argue? She ends with a quote from a man who provides a list of the greatest poets of the last couple of hundred years (c.1900) of which Keats was the only one who was not either a university person or of independent means.So, I guess her recommendation is that if you want to write you need to be independently wealthy \u2013 something I haven\u2019t quite achieved yet. But eminently sensible advice all the same.This book is based on a series of lectures she gave to women at Cambridge Uni on Women and Fiction and it is a delight that rather then make this a polemic she actually makes this a work of fiction \u2013 creating a series of Marys who go off into the world and be idol \u2013 as this is one of the criteria necessary for writing great fiction (no matter what you genitalia are up to) and part of the reason why being wealthy helps.She also says that the best fiction is not written by men or women, but by men or women who have lost a sense that they are writing as men or women. That writing that focuses too closely on explaining past hurts \u2013 however well justified \u2013 ends up being bad writing. That fiction, when it is done properly, has a truth of its own that ought to be authentic and followed by the writer despite any agenda of the writer. This is such a lovely idea \u2013 and much more interestingly about fiction than about women. And this is as it ought to be.Some of Woolf\u2019s writing \u2013 I\u2019ve also just finish reading To the Lighthouse \u2013 feels heavy now, some of her paragraphs go for three pages and that can make reading her feel a bit of a struggle \u2013 but she writes so beautifully and has the annoying habit of making sense that it is no wonder that so many people have become so annoyed with her.In the end I think it is only possible for people to say this is a fierce book or a polemic on the basis of their views, not Virginia\u2019s. Her views on feminism expressed in the book today seem rather depressingly self-evident and expressed in a light and very careful way. But to a society that is not prepared to listen even the mildest expression of unpopular views will seem harsh, polemical and, well, just plain wrong.Not the book I suspected, infinitely better than that."}, {"userName": "Brina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina", "userReview": "Reading my first work by Virginia Woolf was just what the reading doctor ordered after my frustrating experience with Kawabata over this past weekend. In the last few days, I have been organizing my reading challenges for next year, and decided to get a jump start on women's history as well as a January group read in catching up on classics by reading Woolf. Although written ninety years ago, Woolf could be discussing the status of women authors today. Her work remains timely and was a pure joy to read.Mary Beton is roaming the Oxbridge University library in search of quality works written by women authors. This is the task put forth to her by her professors and she is determined to do good by her gender. Yet, as Woolf writing as Beton points out, this is no small task although she believes that Beton is up for the challenge. Until recently (in Woolf's time), women were denied access to universities as well as two necessities for writing: five hundred pounds a year in expenses and a room of one's own in which to write uninterruptedly. A woman's station in life was to take care of one's children and other housekeeping tasks. Only the rich were able to write as they had nannies to care for their children, and writing as a profession was not accessible to the average woman. The shots fired in 1914 changed the role of women in British society; however, as men went off to fight in the Great War, and women were expected to take on jobs outside of the home that were often only employed by men. The women's movement in Europe had begun, followed shortly after by women's suffrage in England in 1919. Writing ten years after these developments, Woolf points out that despite enjoying these gains in society, women still have a long way to go until they are to be considered on equal literary footing as men.Well versed in literary history, Woolf cites many examples in European literature to point out the path women have taken to get where they are in the early 20th century. She starts with an pointed anecdote: if Shakespeare had a sister. Woolf notes that in the 16th century long before the women's revolution, intelligent women would not have been encouraged in reading or writing in any shape or form. Perhaps, if this woman was intelligently inclined, she might have peeked at her brother's work. Yet, any other avenues would have been closed to her unless she possessed a rebellious streak and followed her famous brother to his Globe Theater and immersed herself in his work. With roles in plays closed off to her, she would have died a pauper in a common grave. Having no access to education, the women's space was in the home. This changed with Aphra Behn.Woolf goes on to point out that famous writers as the Brontes, Jane Austen, and Mary Shelley have Aphra Behn to thank as she was the first British woman to write as a profession. Her work may not be as famous as that of her literary descendants but it paved the way so that they could write the now classic books including Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice that are still enjoyed by many today. Woolf takes it a step further, noting that other pioneers such as George Sand and George Eliot felt safer writing under men's pseudonyms. They did so because in the early 19th century, all but a few literary avenues were still closed to women. Even Jane Austen took twenty years to become published for the first time, and women writing when she did were told that if they wrote at all, it should be as poets rather than novelists. In a pointed barb toward the establishment, Woolf notes that had these women been men, they would have been as revered throughout Europe as Tolstoy, and their work rather than War and Peace would be considered the 19th century novel.Throughout the novella, Woolf's feminism is on display. She encourages women to have less children so that they are able to do work in addition to caring for their children and housework. She also points out that by achieving higher levels of education that women should be more than capable of writing great novels. She believes that in one hundred years after the publication of her essay that the amount of books written by men and women should be about equal, reflecting on their actual percentages of the population. While this may be true today ninety years later, women still have a way to go until their classic books are read as much as those of their male counterparts. At the beginning of 2017, I had set out to read 75% of all books by women authors. The percentages fell to around 50/50, what Woolf had encouraged in this novella. As noticed in my experience, woman and men write differently and about vastly different topics, so even if I read four books in a row by women authors, I find my personal pendulum swinging back toward the men. I believe as Woolf that 50/50 is a marker to strive for as this represents an accurate percentage of society. A Room of One's Own has given me intriguing food for thought as I plan my upcoming reading year and should offer poignant discussions in a genre that still at times struggles to find quality women authors. Suffice it to say, the frustrating feeling I had from this past weekend is gone.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Samadrita", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita", "userReview": "Words fail me as I seek to express what I think of Virginia Woolf. Or to sum up in a few measly paragraphs, a book that may just have shattered into a million pieces all my illusions about the art of writing and reshaped my whole perspective.Have you ever imagined a disembodied voice whispering into your ears, the wisdom of the ages as you flipped through the pages of a book? how often have you conjured up the vision of the writer talking to you, teaching you, humoring you and coaxing you to open your mind to newer things as you read a book? Have you felt a book stop being just a book somewhere and instead appear as a beacon of enlightenment that shines down the light of knowledge upon your darkened, ignorant soul? This is how profoundly A Room of One's Own affected me.I will adopt this book as my writing Bible. I will read this every time I feel dejected, sad or terribly lost. And I will read this again and again, until I can ascertain that the message, the very spirit of this fine piece of writing has been assimilated into the core of my being. Okay now that I've gotten the stream of incoherent gushing out of the way, let me try and bestow on this review some semblance of real meaning.It will be irreverent of me to call A Room of One's Own a mere essay or something that grew out of a lecture given at Girton College, Cambridge. This is the essence of Virginia Woolf herself, captured at the peak of her glory, all within 111 pages. This is Woolf reaching out from within the confines of this book and handing out to you the precious fruits of years of her hard work - her thoughts, her research, her observations, her inferences, her views. So what if it is about the subject of women? and writing? Aren't women one half of the human race? The so-called better half at that. What is so wrong about getting to know about the history of their evolution as thinkers, as composers, as sentient beings with the power of expression but without the power to assert themselves?So you better read it. Yes you, the silently scoffing and judging member of the 'stronger' sex. Yes you too. Because it does not only talk about women writers but life itself and the art of writing.The blurb and the countless reviews famously identify this book as one of the greatest feminist polemics of the last century. I beg to differ. It will be unfair to tag it with the label of a polemic - a word with a highly negative connotation. Because Virginia Woolf's aim, instead, was to dispel all forms of negativity from the vocation of writing. Sure, she gives us the feminist side of things - but her voice is not full of seething rage or resentment but balanced, logical, sardonic and even humorous at times.This is Woolf's homage to the spirit of those unsung heroines of the distant past who may have written poems, songs and ballads but were forced to adopt anonymity simply because it was unacceptable for a woman to write. Those imaginative souls who may have wanted desperately to write but could not because society thrust gender specific roles of the mother and wife on them and did not even bother educating them.What if Shakespeare had an equally talented sister but who could never be another Shakespeare herself because she would have been mocked at had she expressed a desire to write plays or poetry? Woolf asks us to spare a moment and reflect on the sad fate of these martyrs, history has not bothered to record.\n\"When, however, one reads of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even of a very remarkable man who had a mother, then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen, some Emily Bront\u00eb who dashed her brains out on the moor or mopped and mowed about the highways crazed with the torture that her gift had put her to. Indeed, I would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without singing them, was often a woman.\"\nShe makes it clear to us that Jane Austen was a clever, clever writer because she never tried to adopt the style of a man's writing or his sentence construction. She created her own. And with a rather limited range of experiences in the real world at her command, she could neither have written about bloody wars nor about politics - spheres women still hadn't earned the right to enter. Instead she wrote what she saw and witnessed in the sitting chambers of the houses of the gentry. (This rekindles my interest in Jane Austen which had started to wane over the past few years.)She also repeatedly stresses on how a woman needs a room of her own and money to be able to write. A room of her own because she needs a breathing space where she could revel in the knowledge of her identity as a person, as a woman, as a thinker over her identity as a dutiful daughter or wife or mother. Although I disagree with her assertion of having money as a necessary criterion for aiming to become a writer, I think financial independence could have been a metaphor for empowerment of women or a reference to freedom from having to rely on someone else, especially a man, and to be able to decide the course of your own life.Woolf ends her essay by exhorting both men and women to take up their pens and write, laying emphasis on the necessity of stepping outside the limits of narrow gender identities and be the writer with an androgynous mind instead - the one capable of uniting the spirit of both the man and woman and letting it reflect in one's craft.And it is at this point, I felt truly thankful for her 500 pounds a year and a room of her own. Since that may have, after all, allowed this marvelous, deeply enlightening piece of writing to come into existence in the first place."}, {"userName": "Riku Sayuj", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj", "userReview": "A World Of Her Own\n\u201cHere then I was (call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please \u2013 it is not a matter of importance) sitting on the banks of a river a week or two ago in fine October weather, lost in thought.\u201dAnd they all do appear, as fictional novelists. Avatars of the Gauri.Of course, I didn\u2019t know they were so, and I didn't want to find out. I knew Woolf was perfectly capable of inventing novelists and novels inside this small thought-world she was spinning.What is their purpose in this fictional essay? They serve as demonstrations. Of writers who could have been, if only certain conditions had been met. Of the many literary geniuses lost to humankind because it was so late in letting the women into literature.And what would have allowed this?Woolf examines the minimum material preconditions that would be required before genuinely self-representative literature can emerge from among the women. According to her this requires enough money, leisure and solitude -- and they should be earned (?) and should come with no attachments. Only then can women start producing literature of their own that is not defined by their relations to men. Woolf considers Austen as the best example of such a completely free feminine literature (for contrast, consider Shakespeare as a genuinely human representation of self) i.e. a true representation of the female self, untainted by anger towards the male attitudes, frustration arising from limited opportunities, fear of social repercussions, wariness of what is expected of a women, and so on.After much reflection and survey of literature and its origins, etc., Woolf comes back to the original point that material conditions are all important.This is something we can agree to. And we can share in the sense of loss that pervades this book. But we need not stop there\u2026Extending The Argument: The Productions of ExclusionWoolf\u2019s exploration is about women\u2019s literature, but I am sure we can extend the scope of the essay a bit beyond that.We should be able to go so far as to tell that the material conditions of any group more or less determines its literary output:1. A leisurely class with plenty of time and education can create and consume subtle and philosophical literature and art.2. A working class which is barely literate, does not have time for leisurely study and starved for quick entertainment will produce and consume crasser types of pop-art, barely going beyond the most cliched levels such as crude comics and perhaps the movies.3. In between, might be the service-economy middle classes who have a bit of education -- required to appreciate moderate doses of art, and can afford the time and energy for producing and consuming genre fiction, YA, etc.So each class develops its tastes and consumption habits based on its unique material conditions\u2026 That is quite Marxist of us, isn\u2019t it?Any group denied this material basis is denied of literature too, as postulated by Woolf for the feminine in her essay. And, as we have seen, each group is denied literature and art to the extent that it is denied material comforts and leisure.Thus we can extend Woolf\u2019s speculative pathos and be sad about how many varieties of literary perspectives are lost to us even today due to such exclusion\u2026As I said, in Woolf\u2019s analysis it is the women who are the victim to this unfair exclusion. But today, perhaps, in many countries women are not so materially backward anymore. That does not, of course, make Woolf\u2019s essay outdated, since it is only a way of looking at literature \u2014 both in its conditions for creation as well as consumption.In fact, I would now like not only extend Woolf\u2019s propositions, but invert them a bit \u2014 to propose that we can even apply the conditions of material repression to the men of today. Women are freer to pursue non-material careers today \u2014 the stigma has been removed and the requisite (500 pounds?) material conditions are easier to come by. Whereas men find it harder.For instance, consider how much easier it is for a woman to go into a career in humanities. For a man to do the same would be much more difficult (note that this reviewer speaks only from the limited perspective of his own social experience of the educational aspirations prevalent in a third world country).Why ?Because societal norms expects man to be the provider \u2014 hence he should not be seen going into careers which are known to be of questionable monetary value, with little or no employment prospects.This is, perhaps, especially true in a patriarchal society like what we still have in India, and probably not as much applicable in the west \u2014 I do not really know. Hopefully a few comments from varying cultural milieus will help us pin this down.All this shouldn\u2019t be taken to be only about production of literature \u2014 production is always in a tangled feed-back loop with consumption as far as arts are concerned. And the same is true for consumption too, i.e., for general reading. It is the women who seems to predominate reading in India. And as an experiment, if you would take one look at the \u2018top reviewers\u2019 listings in India, you will see that it is dominated by women too. Men are not supposed to \u201cwaste their time\u201d reading and talking about books. They have manly tasks to attend to, like selling soaps and making financial instruments.And in keeping with this, of all my friends, the ones who are trained in humanities, especially literature, philosophy, etc., predominantly tend to be women. And those men who genuinely have an interest in literature and art tend to be in a process of self-education (including me) \u2014 stumbling and searching for a sure path, with no formal training or critical education. Hence it is much harder for those men to then be able to compete with the trained women (whether in creation of literary products or of literary markets, through their reading preferences) \u2014 with more time on her hands and a room of her own too, now. It might be that the cultural world is being remade in the image of Eve, or Gauri, and perhaps it is a good thing too."}, {"userName": "Kalliope", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope", "userReview": "May be if \u2018i\u2019 were androgynous, had five hundred a year and a good lock on my own room, \u2018i\u2019 would be able to write a truly fabulous review of this already well reviewed book.

In short, I lovedloveloved this essay by Woolf on women and fiction. When Woolf was asked to talk about women and fiction, she chose to focus on the poverty and subjugation of women in a patriarchy.  \"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.\"What was astounding to me about reading this book, which was first published in 1929, is how relevant it still is today. I've heard female colleagues complain about not having time to write because of family and childhood obligations. This problem is only \"new\" in the sense that at least women have the opportunity to be educated -- it used to be they weren't even taught how to read and write.One of my favorite stories in this book is about Shakespeare's sister. As Woolf imagines it, the sister is believed to have been as talented as William, but she has no opportunities for education or expression. Instead, she is urged to marry young so she won't be a burden to her family.  \"Now my belief is that this poet who never wrote a word and was buried at the cross\u2013roads still lives. She lives in you and in me, and in many other women who are not here to\u2013night, for they are washing up the dishes and putting the children to bed. But she lives; for great poets do not die; they are continuing presences; they need only the opportunity to walk among us in the flesh.\"Truly, there are so many remarkable passages in this book that I could retype the entire essay. I highly recommend this work to everyone.Favorite Quotes\"The history of men's opposition to women's emancipation is more interesting perhaps than the story of that emancipation itself.\"\"So long as you write what you wish to write, that is all that matters; and whether it matters for ages or only for hours, nobody can say.\"\"...who shall measure the heat and violence of a poet's heart when caught and tangled in a woman's body?\"\"Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.\"\"Women have sat indoors all these millions of years, so that by this time the very walls are permeated by their creative force, which has, indeed, so overcharged the capacity of bricks and mortar that it must needs harness itself to pens and brushes and business and politics.\""}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9968594-maria", "userReview": "It's is 7:45 and Im already waiting dressed as best as I can with my dark suit and white/blue collar shirt outside the office for a meeting I've been expecting over a month.

She tells me that the meeting was arranged to be held at 2:00p.m. I don't show her the email and the alarm alert she send me to remind me the 8:00a.m. scheduled meeting, but instead I just smile and say I'll come back at the time planned and excuse myself.The rain continues and I remember I left my book in the car. I always carry a book with me, like a good bibliophile but thought it was completely inappropriate to bring a book titled \"The Age of Atheists\" to a meeting that might be a life changer. Surprisingly yes, we are still living in era where prejudice against your beliefs/ideals or lack of might affect your final outcome or give a wrong impression of the real human you are, we all are. So I decide to finish that one later at home. Anyways, I decide to stop at a close coffee place that has a nice short stack of books and I find Virginia's Woolf \"A room of one's own\". Alright! I think. I get my self a cup of black fresh coffee and make Woolf my companion on this wait.To my surprise, instead of finding an endless waititing time full of anxiety and a repetitive practice on my head of the speech and words I've prepared to say, I get lost and travel back in time to find a friend in Virginia Woolf who lifted my spirits and encouraged me through the powerful and beautiful use of words in her book.On this reading, the author defends that a woman in order to be able to sit down and write, \u201cA woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\", she requires her space and a stable economic status, free of distractors and stressful situations in order to accomplish that goal. She also gives examples of women writers back in time to support her argument (Jane Austen, George Elliot among others).Today we stand in a different era, where women are allowed not only to write but study/work and be a mother/wife at the same time, where she doesn't really need a man who doesn't even love only in order to support her economically but more a life companion to share her goals and failures and who to love by choice. \u201cAnything may happen when womanhood has ceased to be a protected occupation.\u201d Our dreams today are not to have \"a white wedding\" anymore but to be successful in our careers as writers, doctors, lawyers, etc. at the same time we love and raise a family.Perhaps we don't need strictly \"A room of one's own\" anymore to keep conquering our goals not only in writing (unfortunately we might need the money still on this structured economy in which you are according to what you got and ironically necessary for education in order to work), but women continue succeeding in different fields, learning to be a \"multitask human\" through organization. Besides competitiveness get tougher each year, so we must learn to adapt instead of waiting for a perfect environment to settle around us ideally like the authors implies. Women don't need to hide their work anymore behind a male pseudonym and are more free to express an opinion and take the decisions that will lead her future. Maybe this essay was intended for writers only, but I could hear the feminist voice in Virginia Woolf reaching out to us and inspiring us.Yes Virginia, I will remember \"Shakespeare's sister\" Judith, and will give her the opportunity she perhaps lacked due to the conditions of her time. I will let her live in me and inspire me to keep working on those goals I still need to accomplish. I apologize my friends if you dont find a well and deep thought review of this book but a 2cent moment of inspiration. I just felt like sharing my morning with Virginia Woolf. This is why I love to read, it is through the brilliant minds of these authors of our past and present that we find the encouragement, the wisdom, the words we need to keep on going as well as an invitation to make a reflection of who we are and where are we standing today and what still needs to be done, individually, as a genre or as a society. Today I found freedom of my mind and confidence in myself through \"A room of one's own\", an essay published back in 1929.Now excuse me because I have an important meeting to attend....\"Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Flor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55277703-flor", "userReview": "Nunca antes pens\u00e9 que leer un ensayo escrito hace casi 100 a\u00f1os, pod\u00eda resultarme tan interesante y a la vez mantenerme as\u00ed de reflexiva durante varios d\u00edas. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffcOjal\u00e1 todas las mujeres leyeran esto!!

Sitting on the riverside in front of locked gates of universities and libraries, Woolf observes the reflections of weeping willows and uncrossable bridges flowing in streams of blurred ideas and slippery thoughts while she traces back the river of history and gauges the impact of the patriarchal heritage on women\u2019s intellectual independence and their ability to create works of art. Woolf wonders how much greater the works of Jane Austen or The Bront\u00eb Sisters might have been if they had owned a room of their own, a desk where to write in privacy or had they been granted with unleashed freedom to devote to the creative process. Woolf wonders how prolific female writers might have turned out to be hadn\u2019t they been expected to behave as magnifying mirrors of their masculine companions. \"Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size.\u201d (p.31) And isn\u2019t that precisely what Mrs. Ramsay or Mrs. Dalloway did?Initially researched for lectures presented to the Arts Society at Newnham and Girton College in 1928, A Room of One's Own is more than just a feminist essay about the influence of sexual discrimination in the production of literary fiction, which is evident in the lack of published works by female authors since the beginning of times. What in my opinion makes this text a pulsating masterpiece, a hymn to the art of writing and a tribute to the passion for reading, is Woolf\u2019s quest to find the binding essence that unites the writer\u2019s source of inspiration, his integrity and his power of vision with the catharsis that occurs in the inner being of the reader when an unbreakable and almost miraculous bond is created between them, arising above gender, prejudice or the burden of history. Only words are left. Words as bearers of truth that carry the ethos of human beings, whose sexual quality is of no consequence as long as their voices sound true to themselves.Words as incandescent torches that illuminate the most hidden cavities of the reader\u2019s soul, impregnating all its profundities and shallows with unimpeded brightness, soaking it with glowing clarity.Words as cords of communion between reader and writer, uniting fiction and reality. \"But this is what I have always felt and known and desired! And one boils over with excitement, and shutting the book even with a kind of reverence as if it were something very precious, a stand-by to return to as long as one lives, one puts it back on the shelf.\u201d (p.63)But for the written word to achieve that unbreakable blending of the souls, the male and female voices need to sing together, need to spiritually cooperate, need to fuse and to nurture each other to compose the complete symphony in the orchestra of the writer\u2019s mind and achieve the adequate balance of androgyny which will sprout in prodigious writing that contains the secret of perpetual life, defying the passage of time and the erosion of bigotry. \"It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly. Some marriage of opposites has to be consummated. The whole of the mind must lie wide open if we are to get the sense that the writer is communicating his experience with perfect fullness. There must be freedom and there must be peace.\u201d (p.89) Woolf\u2019s appears at the peak of her geniality merging her impressionist techniques of interior multiple monologues and stream of consciousness to deliver a double-edged essay, pungent with latent criticism and dry witted satire but also honeyed with delicious metaphors and vivid imagery.A Room of one\u2019s own has been mostly recognized for its undeniable feminist tone and for Woolf\u2019s poignant belief that women need economic independence to develop their creativity. She defends her plight based on irrefutable proofs provided by a literary map of female writers that she unfalteringly outlines, with uncanny taste and virtuous skill, throughout history.\u201dIntellectual freedom depends upon material things. Poetry depends upon intellectual freedom. And women have always been poor, not for two hundred years merely, but from the beginning of time.\u201d (p.93)But, in my opinion, what made a piece of art of this essay is Woolf\u2019s use of unmatchable poetic and fluid quality of language, which flows following the most intricate stretches of the history of literature, to portray the sacred act of reading as a way of understanding reality through fiction, as the conduit to inner fulfillment, as a catharsis of the senses, as a magical brewery which distillates life from its very essence, as the path to relate not only to the world of men or women, but to a world bared of its superficialities where only words carry the elixir of true meaning."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2012", "userURL":

This book definitely showed her genius and I loved it. I enjoyed reading about the history of women writers including one of my favourites, George Eliot, and how they have been suppressed systematically by patriarchy. I filed this book under \"feminism\" but in no way does it ridicule men or say women are better than men, it simply states that women have not been given adequate chances in literature in the past and have been expected to take on one-dimensional roles, which would make men, as well as women, miserable. The book also talks about how literature as an art wasn't exactly encouraged back in the day, both for men and for women. Overall Woolf makes a lot of great points and it's obvious she sees literature as being of utmost importance in the world.I enjoyed her wit and also her knowledge about literature in general."}, {"userName": "Amy | shoutame", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10559838-amy-shoutame", "userReview": "A highly informative and interesting read.

She sets a scene and describes how a sister of Shakespeare would of been treated had she had the same talent as her brother. She pulls out numerous texts in which men describe the flaws of women (men sure did seem to like writing about our flaws!). These are just a couple of examples of the thought-provoking and interesting way Woolf gets her point across.Overall Woolf shows how the creativity of a woman can flourish if she is just given the figurative and literal 'room of one's own'. I thought it was great look into the ideas of the time and definitely shines a light on the way things are in our culture now. A great read that I would recommend to all!"}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "This book started its life as a series of lectures presented by Virginia Woolf at Cambridge University. What a great experience it must have been to hear her speaking. Her ideas are still solid to the present day and her writing style is wonderful.I think what I enjoyed most from A Room of One's Own was Woolf's logic and the examples she gave to prove her points. The fact that literature and all the arts were a man's domain for so long just because the expectations of women(marriage and child bearing) excluded them from having a place to work - a room of their own. I really enjoyed the time she allocated to writing about Jane Austen who is one of my all time favourites and definitely someone who moved beyond the expectations of society to follow her own dream. A short, educated, informative and very well written book, written a long time ago when values were different yet it still has great relevance today."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "Virginia Plain LiveVirginia Woolf constantly defies my expectations, always for the better.Nothing I had read prepared me for the light and comic touch of this short work (which is not to deny the lasting significance of its subject matter).The essay grew out of a talk she gave to the female students at two Cambridge Colleges in 1928. She edited and added to it afterwards. However, it still bears the traces of a live performance. It must have been inspiring to hear it in person.The Four MarysAt a metafictional level, an author, Virginia Woolf, is physically speaking. However, her narrator is someone else, Mary Hamilton, arguably one of the four Marys from the ballad of the same name:\"\u2018I\u2019 is only a convenient term for somebody who has no real being...(call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please \u2014 it is not a matter of any importance).\"Well, perhaps, it is of no historical importance, when it comes to kings and queens, but it is important in the historical progress of women.The essay is partly about the ability of women to write themselves back into history and literature, whether as authors or narrators. Obviously, it's also about the ability of women to write about female (and male) characters from the different perspective that they bring to the study:\"Lies will flow from my lips, but there may perhaps be some truth mixed up with them...\"Women and FictionWoolf offers her audience an amalgam of both fiction and non-fiction, just as she invites them to become writers of whatever subject matter:\"If you would please me \u2014 and there are thousands like me \u2014 you would write books of travel and adventure, and research and scholarship, and history and biography, and criticism and philosophy and science.\"Ostensibly, the title of her talk was \"Women and Fiction\".Her one piece of advice on that topic was:\"...a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction...\"How much money did a writer need? What could you do with it? Well, in 1928, she calculated:\"Five hundred pounds a year will keep one alive in the sunshine...By hook or by crook, I hope that you will possess yourselves of money enough to travel and to idle, to contemplate the future or the past of the world, to dream over books and loiter at street corners and let the line of thought dip deep into the stream.\" I haven't been able to work out whether 500 pounds is closer to $12,000 or $40,000 per annum now. However, this happened to be the amount of a legacy that she had supposedly received from her [fictional?] Aunt Mary Beton (the name of one of the \"four Marys\").Pen MoneyIt's been inferred that this was Woolf's way of saying that, in order to write, you had to be independently wealthy.This is quite the opposite of what she implied. She frequently talks about women \"earning\" the money that sustains them. She envisaged that writers would either have a day job or would earn the required amount from their writing.They would transition from the \"pin money\" given to them by their parents to \"pen money\" generated from their own writing.There were no limits. That time had already passed:\"If there must be at this moment some two thousand women capable of earning over five hundred a year in one way or another, you will agree that the excuse of lack of opportunity, training, encouragement, leisure and money no longer holds good.\"Her audience was, after all, studying at Cambridge.Don't Give Up Your Day Job?Woolf brings a degree of optimism to the ambition to write. She wanted more women to write, so she and we could read more writing by women, and women could say what needed to be said.However, she doesn't seem to recognise the demands that work itself places on the potential writer. How can you write at night and on the weekends, if you've already worked a full week at your day job? Perhaps she anticipated that you could kill two birds with one stone, by earning your income from writing from the outset?This is a difficult enough task for a single woman. The challenges for a woman with a family were/are even greater:\"How many women had children before they were twenty-one; what, in short, they did from eight in the morning till eight at night.\"A Room of One's OwnThis is part of the reason for the second limb of her advice (and the title of her book), that a woman needs a room of her own.Women, like men, lived in the family home. There was relatively little privacy. Few, except the patriarch of a wealthy family, could enjoy the luxury of a study. A drawing room or sitting room had to be shared with the rest of the family:\"...to have a room of her own, let alone a quiet room or a sound-proof room, was out of the question, unless her parents were exceptionally rich or very noble, even up to the beginning of the nineteenth century.\"There was no prospect of a \"separate lodging which, even if it were miserable enough, sheltered them from the claims and tyrannies of their families.\"A Solitary WomanSo far, Woolf's advice addresses practical issues, the reality of a woman writing.Her aim was to get women writing, by telling them what was required. However, to some extent, her advice applies equally to men. Anybody who wants to write, female or male, has to have some source of income, either from their own labour or that of their partner.Besides, the solitary and private nature of writing means that they frequently have to turn their back on their family. It's OK to have a room of one's own. However, you have to be prepared to close the door on a world that arguably should be your first priority (whatever the gender of the writer parent). Men might find this easier. Women would find it difficult to achieve without a supportive partner or a considerable amount of guilt.Woolf is concerned most of all with the reality of the life of a writer. It's this world into which she invites her audience:\"When I ask you to earn money and have a room of your own, I am asking you to live in the presence of reality, an invigorating life, it would appear, whether one can impart it or not.\"The Androgynous WriterThis concern with reality extends to what women write about and how they write about it.For all its intrinsic feminism, it seems that Woolf didn't think that women needed to write radically differently from men (which is not to say that all men wrote the way she thought they could or should).Woolf advances a theory about the androgynous writer, which is analogous to the views of Coleridge.She asks whether:\"...there are two sexes in the mind corresponding to the two sexes in the body, and whether they also require to be united in order to get complete satisfaction and happiness?\"And I went on amateurishly to sketch a plan of the soul so that in each of us two powers preside, one male, one female; and in the man\u2019s brain the man predominates over the woman, and in the woman\u2019s brain the woman predominates over the man.\"The normal and comfortable state of being is that when the two live in harmony together, spiritually co-operating. If one is a man, still the woman part of his brain must have effect; and a woman also must have intercourse with the man in her...\"It is when this fusion takes place that the mind is fully fertilized and uses all its faculties. Perhaps a mind that is purely masculine cannot create, any more than a mind that is purely feminine, I thought.\"Shakespeare's SisterFrom this starting point, Woolf develops the proposition that men should write from a \"man-womanly\" point of view and women from a \"woman-manly\" point of view.She believes that Shakespeare lived up to the former description. Then she imagines the idea of Shakespeare's sister, \"Judith\", who would live up to the latter.On the other hand, she argues that women shouldn't write fiction from a polemical or political perspective:\"...it is fatal for anyone who writes to think of their sex. It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly. It is fatal for a woman to lay the least stress on any grievance; to plead even with justice any cause; in any way to speak consciously as a woman. And fatal is no figure of speech; for anything written with that conscious bias is doomed to death.\"Woolf argues that writing is an internalised collaboration of the sexes:\"Some collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before the art of creation can be accomplished. Some marriage of opposites has to be consummated. The whole of the mind must lie wide open if we are to get the sense that the writer is communicating his experience with perfect fullness.\"What is most important is the capacity to portray both sexes credibly. Woolf is trying to achieve fiction that does justice to reality.In effect, Woolf challenges her female audience to write like Shakespeare's sister:\"For my belief is that if we live another century or so [ed: 2028]...and have five hundred a year each of us and rooms of our own; if we have the habit of freedom and the courage to write exactly what we think; if we escape a little from the common sitting-room and see human beings not always in their relation to each other but in relation to reality; and the sky, too, and the trees or whatever it may be in themselves...if we face the fact, for it is a fact, that there is no arm to cling to, but that we go alone and that our relation is to the world of reality and not only to the world of men and women, then the opportunity will come and the dead poet who was Shakespeare\u2019s sister will put on the body which she has so often laid down.\"SOUNDTRACK:Joan Baez - \"Mary Hamilton\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHd1m..."}, {"userName": "Rakhi Dalal", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3655942-rakhi-dalal", "userReview": "The distant orange sky seems to merge into a violet-grey as a thin isolating streak rebels against their integration. She sits by the window, her gaze fixed at the thin streak, waiting unconsciously for it to reach the ubiquitous vast blackness of the sky. On the table, in her front, the pages of the open book ruffle whenever a whiff of air passes through the window into her room. Her ears, accustomed to the soundless sound of the pages, hear a symphony of the words played upon the notes of the disquiet encompassing her mind while all else is still. Slowly, they begin assuming a shape and the empty spaces are filled in black with inherent thoughts emerging unbeaten on the surface. This surge of thoughts, even from the disquiet, accompanies a tranquility which appears only occasionally. It appears when she is all alone in her room and more so, when all alone in her mind, when her mind is not bothered by the clutter of crockery while preparing dinner or by the ruffle of drying clothes on a rainy day, when her lovely kids are asleep and her mind is not filled with their incessant questions about the butterflies. And then, when it does appear, each cell in her body strives to clasp it and make it stay there for longer than she can have the luxury of. So, yes, while she does have an actual room of her own, the thoughts in her mind are not necessarily her own."}, {"userName": "Paula Kalin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16174645-paula-kalin", "userReview": "Brilliant.

Tener que soltarlo era un poquito doloroso, aunque hay una ventaja: no se termina tan r\u00e1pido.  Una habitaci\u00f3n propia  (o  A Room of One\u00b4s Own)  es un ensayo que problematiza la autor\u00eda femenina desde algunos elementos que Woolf decide tomar para hablar de ello. En este caso, se dedica a la falta de un espacio en donde la mujer pueda escribir tranquila. Sin embargo, a medida que uno avanza la lectura se encuentra con otras cuestiones que se desarrollan (como, por ejemplo, la amargura que marc\u00f3 a muchos de los textos compuestos por mujeres) con fluidez. No hay nada que se desperdicie porque, incluso cuando uno cree que se desvi\u00f3 del tema, sabe que Woolf (o la no- Woolf narradora) est\u00e1 diciendo algo. O ser\u00e1 que a m\u00ed me encantan las descripciones de Londres y no las considero in\u00fatiles.Hay observaciones muy interesantes sobre Jane Austen y las hermanas Bront\u00eb y varios comentarios que contienen ese sarcasmo tan admirable que arranca una sonrisa c\u00f3mplice. Porque uno entiende que las comparaciones y las humillaciones son odiosas y porque ni siquiera hay que ser mujer para comprender que, efectivamente, la libertad de pensamiento nunca fue igual para todos.

La historia inventada sobre la mujer que en la \u00e9poca de Shakespeare ten\u00eda el genio de Shakespeare (la que se\u00f1al\u00e9 en uno de mis status) se relaciona con esto y sobrevuela todo el ensayo.Se lo recomiendo a todos, sin distinci\u00f3n de g\u00e9nero, porque es un texto precioso que trata un tema m\u00e1s precioso a\u00fan (esa fue una opini\u00f3n totalmente m\u00eda).

I'm overwhelmed and find hard to compose my thoughts. But I must let them out here. Firstly this book or rather the essay contains Ms. Woolf's famous quote \"a woman must have money and room of her own if she is to write fiction\". Throughout the essay she emphasizes her point drawing many examples of women writers in comparison to their counterparts. When I dug deep into her meaning of the above quotation, I found that Ms. Woolf does not mean only about having money and privacy to write. Although monetary independence is stressed, there are more subtle and pressing issues she has addressed under the guise of that quotation. Second I was pleasantly surprised to read her view on the psychology of male and female authors. \"....in each of us two powers preside, one male, one female; and in the man's brain man predominates over the woman, and in the woman's brain woman predominates the man. The normal and comfortable state of being is that when the two live in harmony together, spiritually co-operating. If one is a man, still the woman part of his brain must have effect; and a woman also must have intercourse with the man in her.\" This opened my eyes through a new window. What Ms. Woolf tries to emphasize here is that every human has two sides irrespective of the accepted sex. In a man, there lives a woman to a degree, and in a woman there lives a man to a degree. But when they combine emotionally, a brilliant product sees the light of the day. Although Ms. Woolf has spoken entirely in relation to writing, I could not stop but wonder how truly applicable this principle is to every aspect of human life. This short book was both informative and educative for women in all capacity, especially women writers but also for men. This is no feminine text. The use of such narrow description belittles this well researched masterpiece. I, as both a woman and writer, was left utterly shaken. My perspective with regard to fiction, authors and writing will never again be the same. I also figured out certain elements I lack as a writer to which I should give deep thought and careful attention. I have no more words to say except to express my heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Woolf for this brilliant and genius piece of work which would certainly and subtly change me both as a woman and a writer.Even more amazing on second time around. Such a brilliant piece of work by Virginia Woolf. This is a book that one will never tire of reading; I certainly will not. This is also a book that everyone must read. There is so much one can learn about fiction, writing, authors and about life, men and women in general."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931890-tara", "userReview": "Once, I loved Virginia Woolf. She gets two stars here because of that former devotion, and because of the quality of her prose. But this is a toxic book.Be very clear what Woolf means: to be a writer, one needs to be isolated from life. Art is for the elite of the bourgeois. It is not for your housekeeper. It is not for the janitor at the school where you learned to appreciate the subtleties of verse. It is not for the chef who provides you the lush meals you and your female colleagues mull over. Thank the heavens you can finally afford the luxuries of your male peers! Yes, you have a room of your own, gratefully living off an inheritance you didn't earn with your own hands. Yes, you can finally write because you don't have to cook dinner. But someone else is doing so, and Woolf is quite, quite clear that feminism means liberation for some women. Not for all.Here is the most divisive form of identity politics. Here is an egregious example of sneering ivory tower intellectualism. I understand now why her books left me depressed - her philosophy, however prettily it dresses itself up, is vanity. It asks nothing of us, but it does demand a whole lot from the universe in order to preen and gaze at itself. Woolf lost me for good with her astounding disdain for the plight of anyone outside her narrow demographic. Women should have space and time of their own - all women. All men. Regardless of class. And if Woolf could only write literature with an army of servants to abuse at her every whim, then I'm frankly certain I have nothing of value to learn from her. Of course she was terrible to her servants. In a room of one's own, there is no place for empathy with those carrying the weight outside."}, {"userName": "Gabrielle Dubois", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28233498-gabrielle-dubois", "userReview": "A Room on One's Own passionated me from the beginning to the end! I read it in French, and when you read my English, you understand why! the book in my left hand, and a pen in my right hand. I first started to write down the relevant passages and the reflections it inspired me when I realized that I was noticing almost each page written by Virginia Woolf!So, as I don\u2019t want to bore you with a long paraphrase of Virginia\u2019s text, I\u2019ll rather give you, randomly, a few passages that particularly questioned me.Having time for oneself is a luxury:\u00d4 how much I understand Virginia when she evokes the harmony between oneself, the place, and the time, when one\u2019s body is present but when one\u2019s mind goes further. I remember rare times when I felt that way. Rare, because perhaps this feeling is only given to the human beings who have the leisure to let their thoughts go according to the running water. And when, like me and you surely, one has a job, responsibilities towards children who depend on one, one unfortunately has little time to meditate quietly, in a place peaceful enough to encourage the daydream of mind.So, like Virginia, when comes to me the beginning of an idea for a novel or character, and that I have no time to note it, at night after my working day, desperate, I realize that the idea has escaped, and this makes me furious!Intellectual people and food:As a gourmand (or maybe as a French woman?), I was amused by Virginia's remark on the fact English novelists and writers, when they remember a meal, don\u2019t mention what they ate, but only what they thought and said. And I agree with Virginia: a conversation during a meal is totally different weather you eat quality food or pebble soup!This fact surprised me because, the writers whose life and books I like: Theophile Gautier, Dumas, Balzac, George Sand, Flaubert and others, always talk about, in their memoirs, memories or correspondences, what they ate. They invited each other for diner as often as possible and I\u2019m sure that a good meal unbinds minds more easily! A human being is not a pure brain. A writer cannot be summed up in his mind: he\u2019s also a body that eats and loves. The way we eat and the way we love are an integral part of ourselves, of our thought.Women and motherhood:Virginia raises the issue of motherhood.A woman is no less a woman because she doesn\u2019t want or cannot have children. But what about those who have some?Like Virginia, I think having a child takes much more than nine months: it takes years, because a mother accompanies her child in the beginning of his life. This takes time physically: during this time, a mother can hardly read or work. Work in the sense of earning the money that gives freedom, let\u2019s not even talk about \"making a career\". Having children also takes an immaterial time: a mother has her mind turned towards her child and therefore, she has little time to think of anything else. Well, at least, it has been my case.Therefore, I don\u2019t think it's a waste of time. It\u2019s an experience which enriches a woman's affect, heart and mind.The problem, for a woman who would want and who could express herself in a career, whatever it is, is not motherhood even if it can last for years when a woman has two or three children and accompanies them for a while. The problem is that, meanwhile, men make a career, and then, they don\u2019t care about accompanying the woman in her return to work. They consider that the woman did nothing. So the problem is always the same: what place do men leave to women, in fact, in the society?Urbanity is the daughter of luxury:Virginia writes that \u00aburbanity, geniality and dignity are the offspring of luxury and privacy and space\u00bb. This small passage reminded me of Germinal by Zola: it\u2019s so true that from misery, a too hard job, and promiscuity at home, cannot come the uplifting of the soul and mind.And I think of Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Balzac, Dumas, George Sand, and so many other brilliant writers who were so bored in high school that they preferred to follow their own way. To be free of thinking one\u2019s own way, to be one\u2019s own master of one\u2019s researches, to think and write exactly what one wants, according to one\u2019s own tastes and not those of teachers, is priceless. Well\u2026 I could add, it has only the unfortunate price not to find a French publisher because one is too independent, but that\u2019s another story!Self-confidence:Virginia writes, \" Life for both sexes is arduous, difficult, a perpetual struggle. It calls for gigantic courage and strength. More than anything, perhaps, it calls for confidence in oneself. Without self-confidence we are as babes in the cradle.\"Virginia is absolutely right! Without self-confidence, one does nothing! I can say it because I experienced it, it was even a revelation for me a few years ago. For some, due to their education or their peaceful childhood, self-confidence is natural. For others, self-confidence is something that must be acquired, sometimes in tears. But then, once we get it, what a victory, what a happiness!And perhaps self-confidence is, for me at least, and unlike Virginia, what is more important to express oneself, more than a room on one\u2019s own or money.The world doesn\u2019t need literature:Virginia writes: \"Further, accentuating all these difficulties and making them harder to bear is the world's notorious indifference. It does not ask people to write poems and novels and histories; it does not need them. It does not care whether Flaubert finds the right word\u2026\"And here I'm sure she must have read Flaubert's correspondence with George Sand, because that's exactly what Flaubert wrote to his dear friend George Sand: he was sorry and upset that people didn\u2019t need literature! Ah, my good Flaubert liked to complain!Money and genius:Money, of course, is important. It\u2019s so difficult to live without. But I don\u2019t think, to continue on this page of chapter three, that without money there can be no genius. Flaubert, since Virginia takes it, on many occasions, as an example, would have also written with less money; as well as Balzac, who spent his life running after money while bailiffs ran after him! And the examples are numerous ... With more or less money, all these writers would still have written. Maybe not on the same topics and in the same prose, but they would have written, because genius was in them.Writing in the common room:In chapter four, starting with the paragraph beginning with: \"Here, then, one had reached the early nineteenth century\u2026\" I can see myself there! I mean, of course, not in the talent of a Jane Austen, but in the conditions in which these women writers wrote.It\u2019s in the common room of my home that I began to write and that I still write! What a chance to have a woman's brain that can multiply! How, otherwise, would I have been able to have my mind in my novels, at the same time an eye on the clock not to miss appointment of my daughter at the dentist\u2019s, or to watch over my son, and the dinner cooking? So when Jane Austen's nephew is surprised that she was able to write in such conditions, it's because he's a man and he doesn\u2019t have the ability to multiply his attention without dashing either his work or his children!What women still have to do:Throughout the book one can think that these thoughts about women\u2019s place in the society, although instructive, belongs to history; today, unfortunately not in all countries, women are almost equal to men, if not in fact, at least in rights.We can also think that when Virginia urges women to write, even almost anything, to pave the way for a great female poet or novelist, yes, we can think: Okay, Virginia, but I, gifted or banal, I am neither a writer nor a poet; so why to ask me for it?It\u2019s at the very end of this Room on One\u2019s Own that Mrs. Woolf opens the depths of her thought: this book is not addressed to men, nor to each particular woman who reads it. This book is for all women in the world!And here is the genius of Virginia who tells each one of us all together: free your thought, free your actions. It will be the sum of all these liberated women, each one according to her strengths and her weaknesses, according to her intellectual and material ways, it will be this common progression which will one day open the way for some exceptional women. Women who will write pages so beautiful, so deep, that they will illuminate the generations of women to come.What a blow on the world, what an open mind, what a generous vision!It\u2019s easy to understand, then, that Virginia Woolf, with a mind so above ordinary mortals (and men!), despaired among our narrow thoughts.You think I said everything and you don't have to read the book? Far from it! Run to the library and open this \"Room on One's Own\", please!"}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul", "userReview": "A standard must read text based on Woolf\u2019s lectures to the two Cambridge colleges which admitted women in 1928. It expresses a clear truth and clear injustice in very inventive ways. She describes her trials and tribulations in writing and researching the lectures using a skilfully woven skein of history, fiction, opinion and musings on the outrageousness of the place of women. The part about Shakespeare\u2019s sister is brilliant.Woolf is pointing out the importance of space and opportunity that have been denied to women (and also of course recognition; look at how many of the Nobel laureates for literature have been women). The simple exercise of pointing out the difference in the food at the male and female colleges says a great deal; as does the incident relating to the library. Woolf was accompanied by Vita Sackville-West when she delivered the lectures and there were coded messages throughout. She defended Rebecca West, who had been attacked by Desmond MacCarthy and talked quite directly (for the time) about lesbianism. This was pertinent because the furore over Radclyffe Hall was still quite recent and Woolf explains her own, more careful approach.

Not perfect, and indeed there are a few bones I'd have loved to pick with her, but even with those this book is a boon to humanity.Between bouts of beauteous imagery and fantastic meanderings of thought and form, we have many a discussion on the different subtleties by which the patriarchy in England inherited a history, controlled the present, and in Woolf's time is especially keen on striding forth into the future. The further back in history, the more sapped and stricken the place for women, lack of education and early marriage and many a birthed child making for near nonexistence in the history books. As Woolf hypothesizes, a sister of Shakespeare would have been born a genius, lived in a stunted suspense, and ultimately killed herself out of frustrated potential. Woman was an object to be written on, and the only hope lay in men potentiating the self who took charge of her own fate. As can be seen, the likelihood of this was low, and the chance of a woman escaping the just as damaging idealized portrayal was even lower.Further on, you have the patriarchal ideologies, the lack of historic representation, the social gatekeepers, every single individual male or female who saw the changing times in regards to women and rose up in protest. Even those who desire progress set their sights too low, conditioned as they are by the public and its 'experts' on women, all of them male and very few of them respecting the other half of the population as fully human. Woolf is especially adept at observing this unending of cycle of men pointing out to women their insignificance in the realm of both history and public life in order to maintain the same, an oppressive status quo aided by literature and its then burgeoning reaction to suffrage movements of the time. If women are restricted both in their education and their experiences of life, and the little education they manage through autodidactism is hardboiled in masculine tropes, what is she supposed to feed her dreams of the future and fictioning with?All of that is well on good on Woolf's part. However, Woolf was a writer very much within her own mind, a mind quick and keen to an extraordinary degree but, ultimately, a single mind. We are blessed that she was endowed with a legacy early on, thus giving her years and years to hone her craft and subsequently publish some of the rarest jewels that ever graced the stage of literature, but it is that fortune that dictates her idea of progress as contained within these pages. Money and time alone are great aids indeed, but there is more to good writing than the purest of passive ideals and unlimited free time. Woolf writes of an author disturbed by as little of the meaner things of life as possible, and decries the slightest hint of authors working out their issues and dissatisfaction within their works. I myself am biased in viewing literature as a powerful influence on reality and the realms of social justice, but the classism and borderline elitism are too much to ignore. Also, Woolf could have used some self-observation regarding suffusion of her own writing with male favoritism, especially in regards to giving more credit to the women who battled in realms both fictional and political for the rights she enjoyed at the time of this composition, and continued to battle long after these lectures were over.However. Of the 292 books in my lists that were published before this book, 31 of them were written by women. I wish Woolf had lived long enough to see \"...that elaborate study of the psychology of women by a woman,\" (just get used to the fact that I'm going to be plugging The Second Sex for the rest of my days, and we'll all be happy) and all her seeds of contemplation brought to a gorgeous bloom, but here she penned a marvelous beginning.

There I met a sophisticated man, probably in his forties. He was a lawyer. I started telling him about my studies. When I look back on it now, I realise that I may have been overly enthusiastic, a bore even. However, for years I was enraged by his reaction. \"Why do you want to study law? You'll get married one day and you'll need to help your husband. It would be better if you studied typing and shorthand.\"From my early childhood my parents had instilled in me the conviction that I could have any career I wanted. I had attended a girls' high school which had also fostered an attitude that I could achieve in any field in which I chose to engage. This encounter with the older lawyer was therefore my first personal experience of sexism. It didn't turn me away from studying law, but it did ensure that I painstakingly avoided learning to type for the next ten years!How I wish that I had read this brilliant, passionate, provocative work back when I was eighteen. It may also have enraged me: not the writing, not the philosophy, but the exposition of the silencing of women's creative spirit through the centuries. But it also would have galvanised me and comforted me. I would have wept for Shakespeare's allegorical sister, who dies because she is unable to write. I would have wept for all women through the ages who have been diverted from their calling by their domestic responsibilities. It would have toughened my resolve to grab with open arms every opportunity I had to make a difference in the world and to make of myself something which my sisters of 100 years ago could only dream about.Women studying law in the 1970s in this country weren't particularly rare and these days women make up at least half of all law students. Other professions once considered a male domain have opened up to women, including writing. There's therefore a level at which Woolf's work is of historical interest only. Things have changed for women since 1928. However, there are still areas of life both in the west and in other areas of the world where societal and cultural expectations of women keep them in much the same place as all of those women Woolf wrote about: the women who needed an income and a room of their own in order to truly reach their potential as human beings. I listened to the audiobook edition of this work, which was superbly narrated by the wonderful Juliet Stevenson, who makes Woolf's beautiful, vibrant prose even more beautiful and vibrant. As an added bonus, the audiobook includes several of Woolf's short stories.
