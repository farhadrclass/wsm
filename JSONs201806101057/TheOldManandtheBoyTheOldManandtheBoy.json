For many years Mr. Ruark wrote a column in Field and Stream Magazine...The Old Man and the Boy, Mr. Ruark himself being the boy. This is a collection these.I suppose I love this for the same reason(s) that I love some other books, movies etc. It reflects an idyllic and idealized situation that I find myself very envious of. I grew up in the country and wandered the fields and the creeks. My dad and granddad taught me to shoot, but we were never close, not like it's pictured here. Were Ruark and his grandfather really as close as we see here? Did \"the old man\" share the wisdom of the years that we see here? or is it idealized? I don't know. I assume that it has to be largely true because of the stories related. But whether it's an every word true blow by blow account or if it's embroidered it's still wonderful and brings tears to my eyes.It may be that the book is a bit dated and may appeal to older readers more, I don't really know. I do know that if you didn't grow up in a time or place where you had the freedom to hunt, fish and just be free you can get a taste here. Reading this could be a nostalgic experience and bring back memory or it may be simply a taste of what you missed, but whichever it's something that ought not be missed.And it's something that ought not be forgotten. This one, the volume I read is a library book...Five Stars and I plan to buy the book."}, {"userName": "Dan Moore", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1063031-dan-moore", "userReview": "For me this book is a classic and a must read. It's one of a few books that I routinely give away, not as a gift but just because \"You haven't read it?! Here, take this home.\"Robert Ruark story of growing up in the Southport area of NC puts him in my neck of the woods. His stories of growing up, wisdom shared, and often times earned the hard way, are what anyone, especially any boy should be blessed with growing up. These aren't stories on hunting and fishing, these are stories on what hunting and fishing, and living amongst the \"salt of the earth\" people will do to shape you into a man. As an example, as a father of two, I am often troubled on how to lead by example, especially when my example might not be the one I'd pick. Take the occasional four letter word that escapes my mouth (insert smashed thumb and a hammer spinning into the cosmos). How do I discipline my child for doing what he/she probably learned from me. It's handled perfectly in this book. After an outburst by the boy, \"Dammit, it's my gun. It ain't your gun.\" because the old man took his new gun away from him, the old man says \"You ain't old enough to cuss yet. Cussing is a prerogative for adults. You got to earn the right to cuss, like you got to earn the right to do most things. Cussing is for emphasis. When every other word is a swear word it just gets to be dull and don't mean anything anymore.\" The intent is, ok, there is going to be cussing, but it has a time and a place and until you learn when that is and when that isn't, you aren't telling everybody how grown up you are by cussing (what it feels like at 13), you're telling them how juvenile or how ignorant you are so don't embarrass yourself. This is opposed to what I'd call the mom's view of cussing. \"I'll wash your mouth out with soap!\" Making it bad just makes the kid want to do it more. Making it a responsibility, from an adult who is respected and practices what he preaches is something that sticks with a kid. I know it did with me when I was growing up.This book isn't for everyone, but I haven't met many people I couldn't recommend it to so I'm recommending it to you."}, {"userName": "T. J.

It has an endearing quality that very few other books have. It is a book filled with love; it is a series of stories, and anecdotes written by a grandson about his grandfather. It demonstrates affection in a way that is so masculine, whilst being full of devotion. The Old Man and the Boy is a book that I would recommend to almost anyone..."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3826418-kyle", "userReview": "There were days, now long gone and never to come again, when a boy grew up in a world full of adventure. A world in which a mentor would guide him, show him, teach, and where he could come and go, where he learned all about life, character, integrity. This is true story of that time. As I read the last few pages, it was sad to know that time, some of which I got to taste and experience myself, will never ever be again. We have a term for it today; free range children. It is an experience that only a very few in the country villages, where everyone still knows each other, where a child can meander endlessly and have no fear of being harmed. I lived and grew up in the vintages of that time, only to see them disappear, probably forever. This is a story of young boy, who learns about life from his grandfather. His grandfather is a simple man, a many who respects others and is neither above or below anyone. A man who understands the fruits of the land, and shows a young boy how to hunt, fish, and understand the bounty of the land. The story takes place during the great depression, when everyone was feeling the pangs of the depression, work was hard, and money was scarce. In a lot of ways, this book has some of Tom Sawyer, Captains Courageous, Lonesome Dove, and other great classics all woven in together, but based upon there real life of the author's reflections of growing up. A man lived by his word, and if your word was nothing, then so were you. You looked after and cared for your neighbor. You saw to those who had less than you without ever having a thought of looking down on them, or of doing a good deed. It was simply what you did for one another.Then the book full of just common sense wisdom and sage advice. All told through the eyes of a seasoned mentor who has done that and been there. Who wants this boy to grow right, and to be respected and to respect others. Who sage advice, today would be frowned upon by the politically correct, but the sound, tired, and well seasoned advice that made a boy into a man.I would recommend this book to everyone. You will not be disappointed reading about a time, not so long ago, in which a young boy could grow up to truly become a man."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15457983-cindy", "userReview": "While this is a book for men about being a man, I think in today's world it is women who ought to be reading it. Ruark recounts the profound affect his grandfather had in raising him to be a real man. The old man used man's natural affinity to the outdoors, hunting and fishing, to teach the boy a much broader, deeper wisdom about respect for life and how to live honorably... as a real man.It was an eye opener for me as to how much our modern feminist culture has destroyed real manliness. As it turns out, men really are different creatures, and not really built for androgyny... as least not very often. Our current culture of misandry and its feminization of men seems a bit unfair. We do not have to feminize men to make them decent human beings."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6652102-mike", "userReview": "This is one of those books remembered from childhood. It was before I knew that Robert Ruark was one of those 1950s era depressed, macho-man drunks in the style of Hemingway. But he is a better writer than Hemingway because he actually tells a story you want to read and the characters are not as dull and dreary as Hemingway's.It was a book to escape into for an 11 year old boy.This book might not have withstood time if I went back and read it again, but I suspect that it would. Unlike the narcissistic drivel that passes for memoirs today, this one is a delight to read and you actually like the people and the stories. They are written for the reader.I wonder if this one is in ebook?

The writer (the titular boy) lovingly relates the wisdom passed on to him by his enate grandfather (the Old Man). It's refreshing to read something written by someone who claims to have had the perfect childhood, in spite of the fact that he grew up during the depression. The author's love for his grandfather shines through on every page; the book is consequently sentimental and soppy, and I loved every word of it."}, {"userName": "2patnt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5797085-2patnt", "userReview": "This is my absolutely favorite book. I first read it when I was about 13 and have read it every couple of years since. It is extremely well written and will engage you from the first word to the last. It is a reflection on a simple but rewarding childhood that most of us can envy. Ruark led a tragic life as an adult but this account of his childhood is wonderful.

In this regard, I thought the book was excellent. But the focus of almost every chapter is killing animals. Usually killing a lot of them on every hunt, and the happiness of the boy tends to be measured by how many animals he killed. Generally they killed as many as they could (or the limit), coming home with as much dead animal flesh as they could carry, or put in their Liz (whatever that is). This in the midst of the constant theme that the Grandpa was a conservationist. He insisted on only killing half the birds in a covey. The author talked about the killing terrapins for terrapin stew, but at the end sadly mentioned that for some reason they don't come around anymore. Hmmm. I wonder why. One of the boy's greatest accomplishments, in his eyes, was killing four geese with a single shot. Again, he had the problem of how he was going to carry them all home. The author (who was the boy) mentions that later in life he went on to kill African buffalo and elephants. Congratulations.

He grew up in Southport, a small town at the mouth of the Cape Fear River. At the age of 15, he attended the University of North Carolina. Upon graduating with a degree in journalism, he worked as a newspaper reporter and did a stint in the Navy during World War Two. Following the war, his career took off. In addition to writing for newspapers, he also wrote for periodicals. This book, The Old Man and the Boy was taken from his column in Field and Streams. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a collection of short stories about growing up in the lower Cape Fear region under the guidance of his grandfather who taught the boy lessons in how to hunt and fish as well as larger lessons about life. Ruark fills his writing with wit and humor, making him a pleasure to read.When I was a student at Roland Grice Junior High, every boy I knew read this book. A few years ago, when visiting my parents, I saw a copy of this book in a local bookstore. I snatched it up, knowing that I had to reread it. Unfortunately, I lent it out when I was in Utah and it never came home so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the book, annotated with my notes, to make a more thorough review of the book. Ruark later wrote a sequel, the Old Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Boy Grows Up. It tells stories about Ruark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experiences at sea as well as a big game hunter in Africa. Ruark also wrote several novels. He died in 1965."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2772622-shannon", "userReview": "Okay - so this book came HIGHLY recommended to me....and I get why this particular couple loved this book. It's a sweet story of a growing boy and the lessons of life he learns from his grandfather through fishing and hunting. However, there was SOOO much detail about said fishing and hunting that I wanted to gouge my eyes out. I don't look at myself and see someone who even remotely cares about how to skin a squirrel or exactly what is the best way to shoot a mallard (depending, of course, on whether it is going up or down in its flight pattern). WHO CARES?? Not me....so I found myself skimming a lot and trying to glean the life lessons.

The same guidelines on handling guns and how to shoot are still valid today. Some of the more important parts of this book deal with just going hunting, fishing , etc. not with the results of the day, but why we go do these things. Learn why fishing isn't about catching fish. Learn why some dogs are made to hunt and some aren't. The last chapter \"All He Left Me Was The World\", is not to be read by the tenderhearted. It strikes a chord with any of us who have lost our Old Man.

The boy's Grandpa teaches him everything a rural boy in 1920 would want to know about the lands around him, and quite a bit about human nature, too.
