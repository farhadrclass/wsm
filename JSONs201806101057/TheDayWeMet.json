Of course the nature of the disease itself is sad this book is written in a way that leaves the reader feel a great deal of joy and understanding as well. The story is told partly by the one with the illness as she realizes what, she is doing and what she will lose. The characters though are wonderful, little three year old, Esther provides a great deal of comic relief. Ultimately this is about the strong bond between mothers and daughters. How even though someone's path may be different the family they will be remembered by someone. Lastly, the enduring quality of love for those lucky enough to find it.

She's the mother to two gorgeous girls; Caitlin aged 20 and Esther aged three. Claire is married to the man of her dreams. Greg came along quite late in her life, she'd already raised Caitlin single handedly, she had a great job as an English teacher and owned her own home. She and Greg met, fell in love and are now married and the parents to the delicious Esther. Life is sweet.And then, life decides to kick Claire in the teeth. She's diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's Disease - life is never going to be the same again. Claire and her mother Ruth know Alzheimer's very well. Claire's beloved father had the disease too, both of them know exactly what to expect.Greg buys Claire a beautiful notebook - The Memory Book. Each of them will record their memories of the life that they had together; the good parts, the funny days, the important events. For Claire, this is her way of putting together everything that she feels define her and her life.Rowan Coleman is an outstanding writer, The Memory Book is a story that is both heartbreakingly sad, yet wonderfully funny and uplifting at the same time. Claire and Caitlin narrate the majority of the story, with input from both Ruth and Greg along the way, and this enables the reader to glimpse back in time to experience the events that shaped Claire's life. We share her heartbreak and her joy, we are there when she finds her true love in Greg and we follow her step by step as her brain begins to let her down.There is a real touch of emotional genius in this story, Rowan Coleman has portrayed the disjointed workings of Claire's damaged brain so well, both the gut wrenching sadness and grief and also the naughty mischief and almost childlike thought processes that bring the much appreciated light touch to the story.The Memory Book was never going to be a 'happy ever after' read, the devastation of a cruel illness is central to the story. However, the tender writing, the joy and laughter - especially Claire's changing relationship with her tiny daughter Esther, and the fabulous characters make the heart soar. There is a line quite near to the beginning of the book, spoken by Claire who is talking about her mother Ruth. This line says so much .... it made me cry;\"..... but I don't, because she is my mum, and I want her. And I know I will want her, even when I don't know that I do.\"Rowan Coleman's writing gets better and better. There is no doubt that The Memory Book is her very best novel to date. It is a joy, and I will be recommending it to everyone that I meet.Finally, I have to comment on the absolutely damn gorgeous cover. It fits the story perfectly. The complete book is a thing of great beauty, with delicate illustration on the inside cover too. I know a lot of my blogger friends have their copy as an ebook, and whilst I do appreciate that many people prefer to read on a Kindle, it is when a book as beautiful as this falls into my hands that I remind myself why I only read hard copies.The Memory Book will proudly take it's place on my shelf of favourites, and I know that every time I pass the bookcase and glance over, I will see that flash of a red cover and be reminded of this exquisite story."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "Claire is in her forties when she is diagnosed the early onset Alzheimer\u2019s, inherited from her father. Claire has a husband Greg who she met later in life. She also has two daughters, Caitlin who is 20 and Esther who is 3. Greg buys and gives Claire the memory book so she can write her memories, because they can just as easily disappear from her consciousness moments later. Sometimes her memory is such that she cannot even remember what a phone is called, how to work it or what the steering wheel is for. Some scenes as the present disappears and older memories surface or as she tries to make her escape from the care given her, are both funny and yet heartbreaking. If you can get through this book without resorting to tissues you will be doing better than me. This is a charming story that flits between the present and the memories Claire has. Memories of the first time she met Greg, of Caitlin\u2019s birth, her prom and various other significant events. \u2018The world is a nicer place when you care about people,\u2019 one of the younger characters says in this novel. That is certainly the case in this novel. This family cares about each other. They do their best to try and come to terms with the hardship life has dealt not just Claire but all of them, including her mother Ruth who has come to help. Claire and Caitlin relate most of the story. With each chapter clearly labelled as to who is talking and dated when it is taking place it is easy to follow. Yes, the theme of Alzheimer\u2019s has been done before, but not quite like this. I was thoroughly involved in this book and kept wanting to get back to it. The characters came across as real and very likeable.

I just didn't find it believable, and so many things didn't ring true. Can somebody who has completely lost the ability to read even simple sentences or a child's story book really still write perfectly eloquently in her Memory Book? Lisa Genova's 'Still Alice' deals with similar subject matter so much more effectively and is an amazing novel which I still think about many months after finishing it.I found myself skipping through several of the memory book passages as I found them boring.Still, I'm obviously in the minority, as this book has one of the highest Goodreads ratings I've ever seen!

But it's one you shouldn't miss.Claire has always been a free spirit, practically from the day she was born. She raised her older daughter Caitlin practically on her own, excelled in her career, and never expected to find love until Greg, a contractor, came to do some work on her house. But she was utterly smitten, and it wasn't long before the two had a child of their own, outspoken, three-year-old Esther.It seemed the perfect life, at least until Claire was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's Disease. And while at first Claire felt things slipping away gradually, her decline becomes more rapid than anyone expected. Suddenly her mother has moved in to help care for Claire, she's not allowed to leave the house on her own or do much of anything she wants to, and much to everyone's chagrin, she doesn't feel comfortable around Greg anymore, even though she knows she is supposed to love him and that they had built a life together.As Claire's condition further deteriorates, she discovers that 20-year-old Caitlin has secrets of her own, although they are no match for Claire's own secret involving Caitlin. And when Claire has a chance meeting with a handsome man in a caf\u00e9, it causes her to experience feelings she didn't think she ever would again, feelings she wants to hold onto as long as she can.\nThe Day We Met\n is a tremendously poignant and moving account of one woman's fight to hold on to her life and her memories as long as she can, and her struggles not to disappoint those around her. It's also the story of how her illness affects those she holds most dear, the wounds her condition causes, and how you can continue to be courageous in the face of bleakness. But more than that, this is a beautiful story of love, both between people and simply the need to find and hold on to it as long as you can.While comparisons to Lisa Genova's \nStill Alice\n are certainly inevitable, and both books left me an emotional mess, what sets the two books apart is this is a more purely emotional account, without the clinical aspects of Genova's book. Claire is a much less passive character than Alice was further into her diagnosis. And I felt this book was much more willing to paint Claire as not entirely sympathetic\u2014even though her condition was causing her to act a certain way, you didn't need to like everything she said or did.Rowan Coleman has written a book to savor and think about, and one to cherish, as it is as lovely as it is sad.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."}, {"userName": "Kelli", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146551-kelli", "userReview": "Here we go again: another book receiving glowing accolades & a 4 star average rating that I would rate a mere 2.5 stars. I do think that I would've enjoyed this book much more were I at a different stage in my life...ten years or more ago when I preferred my books lighter and neatly finished, leaving me with a good feeling. To me this felt too shiny in places and wrapped up very sweetly in the end. This is a story with a very serious subject matter, the treatment of which I can only describe as fluffy. A topic that most would deem heart wrenching was too polished and frankly, it was not believable for the main character to vacillate between deep confusion and being cogent, sometimes in the same scene. I understand it served the plot well, but it gave the story the feel of a Hallmark special...as did several other convenient occurrences with in the story.*The few reviews of this book that I have read that aren't rave reviews compare it to Still Alice by Lisa Genova, a book that was raw, gritty and full of difficult emotions. I never found myself thinking of Still Alice while reading this because the two books are so different.

Together they have a 3 year old daughter Esther and Claire has a 20 year daughter, Caitlin, from a previous relationship. All seems perfect, except that it isn\u2019t any longer. Claire has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s and the tragedy is that both Claire and her mother both know exactly what to expect as the same disease claimed Claire\u2019s father. They both know that Claire\u2019s memory will be taken away from her piece by piece so that eventually she will not even recognise her own children.Claire is an independent and feisty woman and tries to fight the disease with all she has. She raised Caitlin single handedly and has a daughter to be proud of. As the disease progresses she has to give up her much loved job as a teacher and Ruth, her mother, moves in with the family to help care for her. There are times when Claire even forgets where she lives and for her own safety, her home also becomes her prison. It was heart-breaking to see the disease taking hold so quickly - not only was she unable to remember the names of everyday items, or read a bedtime story to Esther but even her husband Greg becomes a stranger to her.The \u2018Memory Book\u2019 of the title is a large red journal that Greg buys for Claire so that all the family can record their memories and keepsakes. Claire is encouraged to record her thoughts and memories before they leave her completely and as she begins this process, we learn more about her past life and how she has become the person she is today. It also gives greater insight into her relationships with her mother and Greg.The narration is mainly shared by Claire and daughter Caitlin with the occasional chapter by Ruth and Greg. Both Claire and Caitlin have their own secrets which they are keeping from each other and when these are exposed, the family faces being torn apart.I knew this book was going to be a tearjerker and there were times when I was sobbing whilst reading this. My mother suffered from a form of dementia before she died and Claire\u2019s times of lucidity and confusion bought back painful memories for me. However, although poignant, the book isn\u2019t all about sadness. There are many moments of laughter and I loved Claire\u2019s feisty nature and sense of fun, especially when she was trying to outwit her mother and escape!This is not just a book about Alzheimer\u2019s, it\u2019s also about the love between mothers and daughters and families and the bonds that can never be broken no matter how testing the circumstances.I\u2019m not normally a gusher but this book has a gorgeous cover containing a wonderful and heartrending story.

I read this following several friends recommendations and after a week of heading to bed early with my kindle finished late last night with tears in my eyes. This is such a stunning book following the lives of Claire who has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's and her family (husband Greg, grown up daughter Caitlin, 3yr old daughter Esther and her mum Ruth). As each of the family deal with the symptoms of Claire's illness in their own way the adventures unfold onto the pages. Rowan Coleman's portrayal of this cruel illness is spot on and on many occasions brought tears to my eyes remembering my grandmother going through similar incidents. I loved the way the story split into different perspectives of the different characters and also the input stories of the Memory Book the family are compiling to help Claire regain the information as its stolen away by the Alzheimer's A truly magnificent book that I'd recommend to several friends and family worthy of far more than the five stars I'm limited to giving it."}, {"userName": "Myrna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8789819-myrna", "userReview": "I can see why this book has a lot of high ratings.

Between the chapters of the novel are journal-type entries from the Memory Book of the title. This so-called memory book is a scrapbook / journal that each member of the family writes in to help Claire to remember and to retain the essence of herself. Each of these entries helps us to understand Claire's personality and to really care about the relationships that she has with her husband, mother and two daughters. The main chapters of the book alternate between the points of view of both Claire and her eldest daughter Caitlin. The main story deals with Claire's struggles to remain herself, to retain her memories and to try and still be there as a mother, wife and daughter and when the book follows 20 year old Caitlin's point of view we see her struggles with becoming an adult and loosing her mother at the same time. This book is heart breaking. Dementia is such a cruel disease; to see someone try to battle against forgetting the people they hold most dear to themselves and trying to battle against forgetting themselves is just so utterly sad. I can't really say much else about this book without giving away spoilers. I would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who likes women's fiction and to those who don't. Rowan Coleman's novels are always so well written and carefully structured and are very enjoyable to read and this is no exception even if it turned me into a blubbering mess by the end!I think the following excerpt from the book probably sums up the whole feeling of the story better than I can:\"Decide to be happy... Trust your heart to know what to do because the world might crumble away around you, your brain and body might betray you, but your heart, your spirit...that is what will stay true. That is what will define you. ...

I think I had been putting this one off since reading The Summer of Impossible Things, which I read last year and was in my top 3 reads of 2017. The reason I put The Memory Book off was because I was rather worried about reading it! This author seems to have an uncanny knack of bringing out very deeply hidden emotions in me-deeply hidden for a reason because I\u2019m a very emotional person at the best of time and when those walls come down\u2026..well, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not a pretty sight! And if I had read this book when it first came out then it would still have left me a snotty, swollen eyed mess but last year something happened in my own life to make me totally empathise with Claire as she struggled to cope with her early onset Alzheimer\u2019s.Claire\u2019s story really did touch me very deeply indeed. I was able to relate to her wonderfully warm and inspiring storyline in a way that I hadn\u2019t expected and came to absolutely adore her. I also knew that there would be no magic cure for her early onset dementia and to watch her struggle with the relationships she had with her husband, her mother and her two wonderful daughters broke my heart into a thousand tiny pieces. Her story is beautifully told here with the emphasis on the unconditional love of a mother for her child. I highlighted so many phrases in this book but I think my favourite, and the one that summed it up best for me, was \u201cmums are warriors: they might be knocked down, but they always get back up\u201d. And that simple observation perfectly portrayed the battle that Claire, alongside own mother Ruth and her daughter Caitlin, faced as Claire\u2019s illness developed.I laughed, I cried and I didn\u2019t want this book to end. But when it did, I was left feeling devasted but strangely uplifted and very privileged to have felt a part of Claire\u2019s story. Rowan Coleman writes so beautifully about such an emotive and sensitive subject that once again she held my broken heart in her hands as she weaved her magic and I love her for it!Very highly recommended by me!"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2464996-anne", "userReview": "Dearest Rose, published by Arrow in September 2012, was one of my favourite reads of last year. If you haven\u2019t already read it, you really must. Having discovered Rowan Coleman's writing through that wonderful book - and realising I'd shamefully overlooked nine more - I just couldn\u2019t wait for the release of The Memory Book. There were a tantalising few chapters at the end of my Kindle version of Woman Walks Into A Bar \u2013 100% of the proceeds of which the author donated to Refuge, the domestic abuse charity \u2013 which had me in tears, and the ensuing wait has been really frustrating. So this is \u2013 with no apologies \u2013 going to be another one of those gushing reviews. This book was all I hoped it would be, and so much more.Claire has early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. She\u2019s bright, attractive, intelligent and witty, recently married to the man of her dreams in gorgeous builder Greg and the loving mother of 20 year old Caitlin and three year old Esther. But everything is slipping away \u2013 she\u2019s had to give up her job as an English teacher, she can\u2019t find her way back to her own home, she\u2019s losing the ability to find words or to read to her young daughter, and she\u2019s forgetting how much she loves her husband. Her mother Ruth has moved in to care for her \u2013 she knows what to expect, having lost her husband in the same way, and the relationship between her and her daughter is a loving but difficult one. Greg gives Claire a notebook, where everyone can capture their memories \u2013 the book is interspersed with stories told from various perspectives, some funny and some unbearably sad. Claire also adds mementos from her past \u2013 the bits and pieces that we all have that capture the key moments in our lives. And against all this \u2013 all the immensely sad and very funny memories \u2013 there\u2019s another family crisis to deal with.If all this sounds dark and depressing, I need to dispel that impression straight away. While there is immense sadness here, there\u2019s also a tremendous amount of humour \u2013 Claire retains her wit and sense of fun, and her attempts to escape from captivity and her disjointed conversations really have you laughing out loud through all the tears. This is a book with love on every page \u2013 your heart will break for Greg, the man she has forgotten how to love, and there are some quite wonderful moments with her mother and her daughters.I think I\u2019m a little in love with Rowan Coleman. She writes quite perfectly, the humour and sadness beautifully balanced \u2013 it might only be January, but I have no shadow of doubt that this will be one of my books of the year. The introduction to my advance reading copy says \u201cperfect for fans of Jojo Moyes\u201d \u2013 much as I also love Jojo\u2019s books, this one will win over an army of new fans for Rowan Coleman.

I am already telling everyone I know who reads to buy it and read it, with a large box of tissues by the side!It is the story of Claire who is 40 and married to Greg who is 10 years younger than her. They have a daughter Esther who is 3 and Claire has a daughter Caitlin who is 20 who she brought up as a single parent. They also live with her mother Ruth, who has come to live with them to care for Claire who has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's Disease. The Memory Book of the title is the book they all contribute to in an attempt to get down everyone's memories of her, and particularly her own memories before they all disappear.What follows is a really emotional read. At times I had tears in my eyes at the unfairness of it all. This is just a normal family facing a horrendous nightmare, and their very normality brought it home that this could happen to anyone. It is not all doom and gloom though, there are some quite humorous moments and Claire herself admits to having a gallows humour. Having said that, she is never made to look like a figure of fun, the author treats her and her condition with respect.We watch her as she tries her hardest to pin down her memories with the help of the book and her mother. We watch Caitlin trying to help her mother, but she has her own problems to deal with which she cannot bring herself to burden anyone else with. Worse of all, for me, was watching Greg deal with losing his wife so soon as already she seems to have forgotten that he is the love of her love.It is a wonderful, emotional read which moves very fluidly towards an ending that was just sublime.

But, it was really, really hard."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8012552-karen", "userReview": "Just a bit to sickly and untrue for me"}, {"userName": "Angela Aagenborg", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22834228-angela-aagenborg", "userReview": "Wat.

So it was on a particularly brave day a few weeks after my mum passed away that I chose to read this book and really, I think I read the perfect book at the perfect time. It\u2019s an emotional story but not grim at all. It has its moments of sadness, but those moments are effectively combined with humour and other moments which make you smile. This book truly had it all. Rowan\u2019s writing was insanely moving and powerful and The Memory Book was stunning and inspiring in a way that my words can\u2019t even begin to express. I was completely moved by Rowan\u2019s wonderful portrayal of the love shared between Claire, who has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and the people who make up her family \u2013 mum Ruth, daughters Caitlin and Esther and husband Greg. Each of their individual relationships were impacted in a way which was out of their hands to control, but each of those relationships were also wonderful and fascinating to read. It seems to me that it\u2019s impossible to not fall for every one of these characters and just want the best turn out possible, regardless of how likely or unlikely that may be. Claire and Caitlin were the main characters here though the others were well represented and developed too. Their mother-daughter bond was affecting to read and felt very real and believable. Claire was strong-willed, with a great sense of humour and a lot of fight in her. She was not willing to lie down and be beaten \u2013 or let her loved ones do the same \u2013 and she was an inspirational character. I also adored her relationship with her youngest daughter Esther, and their moments of mischief and fun really brought life to this book. Caitlin was the character I could connect with the most \u2013 how her life was impacted on by the worsening health of her mum but also her journey of self-discovery and finding herself. Greg and Ruth also had important parts to play in The Memory Book and Rowan\u2019s character development is some of the best I\u2019ve ever read. I loved the entries into the memory book. They added uplifting touches to the poignant story of a family being threatened to be torn apart by Alzheimer\u2019s. It was refreshing to see the memories the family valued, and their different takes on all the stages in their lives. It was ultimately positive, because regardless of how difficult, how upsetting things got for them all, they had their memories that would always be there to look back on and smile at, which was something I felt like I could connect and identify with. Rowan combined these with the present day story beautifully and this book also touched on looking to the future \u2013 it was about choosing to live rather than letting life pass you by and this was motivating and written wonderfully. It\u2019s rare to find a book that can hold a real impact over the way you see things in reality but I found The Memory Book to be a really empowering read and one that has stayed with me and helped me to embrace a little bit of positivity. I can\u2019t deny that it did move me to tears as well, but in the incredible way Rowan wrote this, it was not an overly upsetting book \u2013 more life-affirming, and simply perfect. It made me miss my mum even more, if that\u2019s possible, and yet feel a little bit stronger and that\u2019s what tells me five stars and all the words I can come up won\u2019t ever come close to doing this special book justice. But it does make The Memory Book one of the most heart-warming and one of the absolute best books I\u2019ve ever read \u2013 one which will stay with me for a long time and my last mention has to go to the brilliant, clever ending that ensured this book finished in the same stunning fashion Rowan delivered the whole way through."}, {"userName": "Beadyjan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2845570-beadyjan", "userReview": "I'm in love! With a new author - how can I not fall head over heels for someone who can move me as deeply as this with her words? She has reached so deeply inside me to touch my very soul with this stunning book.Told from the unusual perspective of a woman with early onset alzheimers, it is poignant, sensitive, funny and harrowing all at once. Told in the voice of Claire, teacher, mother to 2 fabulous daughters, grown up Caitlin and 3 year old Esther, and daughter to Ruth. As Claires mind slips from lucidity to confusion, we take the journey with her as she begins to forget people and places, names of things and even how to do simple tasks, the plughole becomes the hole in the kitchen and carrots are now orange things, but the worst omission of memory must be that she has forgotten her husband Greg, her memories of their deep love and devotion are just gone and she can hardly bear to live with the stranger he has now become to her.To help her hold on to the remaining memories of her life Greg brings her a gift of a beautifully bound journal - the eponymous Memory book in which Claire begins to record her memories whilst she can put them into words and she adds tokens and souvenirs from past and present events and this is how the memory book takes shape and we get to know her and her family intimately.The fact that she manages to retain her sense of humour lifts the book from the morbid story it could be, to a joyful celebration of life and love and inevitably its a story about motherhood as it explores and exposes the cracks and glue which bind mother to daughter through everything, her relationship with her own mother, and her two daughters is perfectly real and deftly painted with the light touch of a feather and the intricacy of the richest tapestry. It brought back such poignant memories for me of my own Mother, who died over 30 years ago, that I broke my heart sobbing myself to sleep several times during this book, yes its sad but its also intensely uplifting and even joyful.I don't know if what Claire is going though is exactly what it feels like to be losing one's memory - I doubt anyone truly can as anyone who has gone through it enough to be able to tell us what it feels like won't be able to remember enough about the process to share it with us! But Rowan Coleman truly makes us believe that this is exactly how it must feel and has written a truly epic novel that will remain in my memory for years after I have forgotten how to use my front door key and how to put on my shoes!This is undoubtedly a book which will feature in my top books of 2014, it ranks so highly I want to give it 10 out of 5 and I want EVERYONE to read it. If you only read one book this year, let it be this one, its sensational and I loved every word."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22303874-megan", "userReview": "Before diving into this review, shout out to Net Galley for giving me an advanced copy. (Woot! Woot!)And now we dive.This is such a hard topic to talk about. The mind is a crazy thing that we have yet to fully understand (and maybe we never will). I was interested in reading this one because I have personal experience with Alzheimer Disease, while it's not early on-set. My grandma has it, and it's definitely hard to be around sometimes. Sometimes I'm a different person that she knows (her sister), sometimes I'm just a young girl, and sometimes I'm her granddaughter. So, when I read the synopsis I was ready to jump on in.The first thing that really grabbed my attention, or didn't, was how light it was written. Coleman talks about someone's life and memories deteriorating and I felt nothing. It wasn't dark. It wasn't super emotional. It just was words that I read. I think if it was told more from Claire's perspective and not given so much reprieve from her thoughts and her mental travels, that it would have been more compelling.That being said, I didn't think the book was horrible. It was a light read I could unwind with right before bed. It wasn't a dark, scary book that would keep me up at night. It wasn't a book where I needed to be on-point to understand the interweaving themes and symbolism. A great combination to just clear my head, relax, and drift off to dream land.I could see where Coleman was going with her ethos, but I just didn't feel anything. I didn't cry, smile, or laugh. I could tell places when she wanted me to feel those things, but that's about it. I think I would have liked it more if it was darker, if it pushed the boundaries a bit more than it did. Coleman may have played it safe with this one.I really liked the whole idea that Coleman had writing about something so personal. I didn't read about Coleman after the book. (I kind of just wanted to be done with this one.) But I did see that she had personal experience with Alzheimer Disease as well, which makes this book a tiny bit more touching. Just a bit.My rating and why: I gave this book three stars! I read it, but it wasn't really for me. I could see the appeal for others. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for it, or maybe this just isn't my genre. I'm not sure.

Claire sadly has the early onset of Alzehmiers and is slowly getting more and more forgetful so Greg suggests they have a Memory book where they can all write their thoughts in, memories from the past and present. Each Chapter is told from the side of one of the main characters.I found myself gripped from the start - i laughed, i felt sad, i felt love and joy but most of all i felt the strength of love one family can have. BUT Claire meets a mystery man - Ryan - who can he be and why does he want to be part of Claires life when she is unlikely to remember him the very next day. Only time will tell what will happen with their newly found friendship.I can honestly say i loved all of the characters and the bonds between them, each one having a part to play in Claires life.buy this book and be immersed in a trully wonderful story that will stay with you for a long time.

It\u2019s the first I\u2019ve read by Rowan Coleman, but it won\u2019t be the last.It\u2019s about a woman with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s. She\u2019s married with two young children and a mum who we meet because when the story starts she is already in the picture, moved in and looking after the family because the diagnosis is firm and Claire is advancing rapidly.Her marriage was a fairly recent thing so it is one of the things she forgets first but her two children she clings onto with everything she has and it\u2019s these relationships, with her mum, her two daughters and her husband that make the book.You might imagine it would be a sad book all the way through, but I was laughing out loud in lots of places and no it didn\u2019t feel inappropriate because I was there, with Claire.It\u2019s also a sensitive book. The Alzheimer\u2019s is handled so well and described for the reader just brilliantly from Claire\u2019s point of view. Like a fog that shrouds the words or memories, she\u2019s trying to access.I did cry and I did laugh. What more can you want? A book that evokes emotion from you is a great book indeed.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Jo (A rather Bookish Geek )\u2764\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-jo-a-rather-bookish-geek", "userReview": "This for me was a fairly good read, but in my opinion, could have been rather a lot better. The book's main focus, is on the devastating and cruel disease, that we all know as Alzheimers. I have worked with individual's with Alzheimers for many year's and I am at this moment losing a close family member to it too. I lose a bit of them with each day that passes. With that said, some of the thing's in the story are not quite believable for me. Such as, if an Alzheimers sufferer loses the ability to read a simple children's book, this probably means that they will lose the ability to write too. In the book, Claire, who is suffering from the disease, could still write many pages in the memory book, but couldn't read a simple book to her daughter.I found the other characters well thought through, but unfortunately the book was all over the place for me.
