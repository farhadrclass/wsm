A whole year of recommending this is starting :D Beware, I'll show no restraint :P\u278a A tale of survival : Tell me, fellows readers, what are you ready to do to survive? What happens when the only hope life can give you is to eat expired chili and to fight with an old homeless over your fucking shoes? When the only choice offered to you is to attend an assassin school or to wait for a painful death to come? \n\"Happiness is just the absence of pain.It's the best I can hope for.\"\nJust picture it. You're alone. Cold. Hungry. Desperate. Feeling guilty and useless. Here comes a bunch of crazy teenagers who ask you to follow them. What do you do? Do you follow them, even if it maybe means losing yourself even more? FUCK YEAH. \u278b Sarcastic humor and irreverent ton everywhere. Hey, we're talking about an assassin's school, so obviously, don't expect regular high school drama. - Wait a minute, oops, actually, YES, expect it : girls drama, bullying, social groups, assignments - Just keep in mind that every single event can lead to some messed-up and bloody situation. Be prepared for drugs, blood, and many good laugh nonetheless. \u278c A world building is absolutely amazing : Welcome to San Francisco in the late 1980s! \u278d Friendship and amazing characters. Strangely because we're talking about crazy fucking teenagers, duh what I loved the most was to follow these characters and to see the growth of their friendship. To be frank, it's really, really rare that I find myself connecting to comic books characters. For real, I end underwhelmed most of the time with comics, because I struggle to feel, to root for the characters. While here, it seems that I couldn't get enough of them. \u278e Marcus. Yep, the guy won his own special place in my heart. Indeed there's nothing that I like more than characters with ambiguous morality, that's why I adored this little guy who's not completely evil but who's able to follow harsh paths in order to save himself and to be finally accepted. Moreover, I really have a soft spot for lonely, broken and slightly hopeless male-leads, I have to admit. And he's freakin hilarious on acid.\n\"Given what we're about to do -- I shoud feel like a terrible person.But I don't. Morality's just comfort food -- It holds no meaning outside of our minds.\"\n \nVerdict\n : In my opinion Deadly Class offers everything I need to love a story : great characterization, suspenseful plot, enthralling world and so freaking fun, not to mention the ability to make the reader think - about this life, about the importance of friendship and the choices we make every day.

I look forward to it building a small but passionate fan base then having Syfy prematurely cancel it as it finds it\u2019s footing. #SaveTheExpanse Here\u2019s the trailer. In the early 80s, the world came crashing down around Marcus Lopez when a bridge-diving schizophrenic flattened his parents. \ud83e\udd28 A terrible tragedy which could have been prevented had Ronald Reagan not cut funding to mental health facilities leading to hundreds of patients being turned out into the street. We catch up with a teenage Marcus a few years later in 1987. He\u2019s been kicked out of yet another foster home and left to fend for himself on the mean streets of San Francisco. Turns out he\u2019d rather bow and scrape by in the gutter than kowtow to their whims of authority. He\u2019s struggling mightily though. In fact, he\u2019s considering taking a swan dive of his own. Until one day he stumbles upon a secret society that offers him new hope, and a promise to help in his quest for revenge against the man who ruined his life.This secret society, aka Kings Dominion School of the Deadly Arts, is where Marcus hopes to learn all the tricks of the trade to become the perfect assassin. He\u2019s champing at the bit to get right to it. Coming straight outta Compton off the streets he couldn\u2019t care less about any high school drama or bullshit cliques, so rather predictably he falls in with a group of outcasts. But, it\u2019s not long before he finds himself in the doghouse for coloring outside the lines.Thankfully, the story eschews most of those high school clich\u00e9s when his friends break him out the doghouse and hit the road.Once the group drops some acid things really go bananas.The artwork is fantastic throughout but shines the brightest during that acid trip. It\u2019s essentially all about the colors. The line work is simple and the colors are flat, but when juxtaposed with complementary colors everything really pops. I dig it, man, I dig it! A pointillism technique is used on a few background objects and shading (a method invented by Georges Seurat employed here in the vein of Roy Lichtenstein). Take that, you art school snobs! My only real complaint is about the cheesy character that pops up every so often. A sicko, reminiscent of Mason Verger from Hannibal, who apparently was in a group home with Marcus and claims to be his \u201cmortal enemy.\u201d Blah blah blah, I honestly couldn\u2019t care less. But I have a sneaking suspicion that they\u2019ll devote way too much time to this guy in future volumes. Overall, a pretty successful first volume. Hopefully, the story will continue to surprise, and carefully sidestep all those annoying clich\u00e9s.4 stars, Recommended"}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/\n\u201cLife is a series of unique opportunities.

Reagan\u2019s healthcare cutbacks meant suicidal schizos were set free on the streets, and one such sufferer decides to end their life by jumping off the Golden Gate bridge - shame Marcus\u2019 folks were directly in the drop zone! Suddenly orphaned, teenage Marcus is living on the streets when he\u2019s approached to join a secret underground assassin\u2019s school: the King\u2019s Dominion School of the Deadly Arts. Marcus\u2019 dream of assassinating Ronald Reagan begins to take solid form\u2026 Deadly Class threw up a couple red flags for me right at the start. 1) Rick Remender started writing about therapists and littered the script with phrases like \u201cpositive mental attitude\u201d, \u201cnegative feelings result from negative thoughts\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t change reality but can change the way you feel about it\u201d. I\u2019ve recently gotten done with the weakest of his Image comics, Low, which is chock-full of that kind of crap and I really didn\u2019t want to read another story about the same stuff. Thankfully the first issue is the last time we hear the results of Remender\u2019s therapy sessions. And 2) the ridiculous American obsession of rigidly-defined high school cliques: these are the jocks, these are the nerds, these are the burnouts, etc. American friends have told me how cartoonish films like Mean Girls make their high school years seem as nobody is segregated like that, and it\u2019s certainly not that way in Britain either, so I don\u2019t know why writers keep writing high-school set stories in this fashion. Anyway, this approach is thankfully dropped halfway through the book and everyone starts mingling together like normal kids do. Once you get past the red flags, Deadly Class is pure fun, Fear and Loathing style! Marcus and his new friend Willie are sent to pick out and kill someone who deserves to die. Things don\u2019t go well and Marcus is thrown into a solitary cell for punishment - until his sponsor, Saya, the girl who got him into King\u2019s Dominion, busts him out and they and a group of friends go on a roadtrip to Vegas! Remender writes the kids pretty convincingly. They get up to no good, taking drugs, flirting hard with one another, drinking, causing havoc in casinos and the hotel room. The comic captures and conveys that spirit of raw energy and excitement to the reader very strongly. Like a lot of Remender\u2019s comics it\u2019s easy to see where he\u2019s drawing inspiration from: Marcus is essentially Disney\u2019s Aladdin (I think he\u2019s even called \u201cstreet rat\u201d at one point) and the way he navigates San Francisco\u2019s rooftops is a lot like Aladdin during his opening number in Agrabah, albeit darker. The whole assassin\u2019s school isn\u2019t new either and this one felt a lot like the Hellfire Club\u2019s Academy from Jason Aaron\u2019s Wolverine and the X-Men, and then the whole Vegas zaniness is classic Hunter S. Thompson. Remender\u2019s a lot funnier here than I\u2019ve seen him before. Generally a lot of the Vegas scenes are light, especially as Marcus drops a ton of acid sold to him by (of course) a Grateful Dead follower, but I loved the elevator scene in particular. Marcus is stood between two tall dudes in business suits and he\u2019s obsessed with \u201celevator etiquette\u201d, whatever that is, and comes out with: \u201cBoy, oh, boy, they, ah, they sure do build \u2018em big in Vegas, huh?\u201d - the looks on the guys\u2019 faces afterwards is fantastic. Wes Craig\u2019s art is very good throughout but we see his range once he starts drawing things from Marcus\u2019 perspective when super-high. Lots of nightmarish images that seem quite funny to the non-stoned audience but terrifying to poor Marcus! I love Paul Pope\u2019s art and I got a strong sense of Pope\u2019s influence in Craig\u2019s style. The first volume of Deadly Class isn\u2019t the deepest comic you\u2019ll read or the most emotional, thoughtful or all that original - but it\u2019s entertaining and fun in the same simple way Black Science is. Remender proves once again it\u2019s not the story but how you tell it that matters. I really enjoyed Reagan Youth, I highly recommend it, and I\u2019m looking forward to more shenanigans from the rest of the series!"}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18082438-chris", "userReview": "[The main characters go on a road trip, take some drugs before getting some more drugs (go drugs?).

I just couldn't resist jumping on a fresh Remender bandwagon a few years back. The real surprise? That this is my favourite thing Remender has ever done (Uncanny X-Force just got inched out). I just read issue 21, which is the conclusion of volume 4, and thought I should come back and recommend the series (really, I should be writing more about single issue series I follow as the trades come out). Wes Craig is the real superstar here. His art blows the doors off of a lot of other series out there with his playful approach to panels and his gorgeously skittish lines. Colourist Lee Loughridge brings to life this world in neon hues and sickening colour combinations as the scene requires.Issue 21 is a huge turning point for the series and I was genuinely shocked by the direction Remender has decided to take the series. It's the kind of complete change to a series' MO that you'd never get from a superhero comic. The punk aesthetic, the groundbreaking layouts, fantastic art, surprisingly philosophical and text-heavy comic speaks to me like everything a hip comic should be. This is by any standards a cool thing to like. These kids do bad things, people get killed, and there's copious drug use and inspired hallucinatory sequences. This is the kind of comic your mom probably wouldn't have wanted you reading when you were in high school. I usually hand Saga over to my friends who are looking to check out comics, but I think I may start throwing Deadly Class into rotation for those looking for a grimier, saltier tale. *Flipping Through Floppies is a semi-regular review series of single-issue comics (known in some circles as floppies) that I follow.

A native of Nicaragua, his family left after involvement with the Sandinistas and the US Government. After a couple happy years in America, his family is dead, and Marcus shows a deep hatred towards Ronald Reagan, mostly for cutting funding to medical facilities, which had a very negative effect on his family, and he is on the run. He is almost caught by the police, and while he is running away, he is aided by several other teenagers, who encounter him alongside an old man. This old man is known as Master Lin, and he runs a school for training assassins and the next line of crime syndicates, Kings Dominion School for the Deadly Arts, a more murderous version of Xavier\u2019s School for Gifted Youngsters, although I doubt it doesn\u2019t contain a similar amount of emotionally drained and moralistic-for-odd-reasons people. Marcus decides to join after understanding that if he is to survive, he must get off of the streets, and to the school he goes.After his first day, he has managed to piss off quite a few people, including the son of Stalin\u2019s top assassin, and the daughter of a Neo-Nazi hitman. But he finds his place with the same group of misfits that rescued him, with some other reviewers comparing them to The Breakfast Club gang, but with more murder in mind rather than a philosophical discovery of who they are and all that. But the book is not simply a story of some kids training to kill others, it is a tale of kids being trained to change the world in a positive way, if it ought to be through a bullet, then so be it. It takes itself seriously when it comes to mental health, what it is like to be drafted into something you never wanted for yourself, trying to get out of the life even if you have been raised in it, being hunted down by a a disfigured weirdo that likes to have sex with animals, amidst a backdrop of teen love, the political unrest that led them here, and the late 80\u2019s underground.What surprised me about this comic, is that I never actually expected Marcus to be considered for this place. We are not told a lot about his background, since all people belonging to this school have a history of crime, whether it be as a family business, or affiliation, while Marcus does not show a definitive one, although due to a small scene when he opens his locker, I am not unaware we will get a more in depth view on why and how he is considered to be among all of these people. Either way, I will now adopt him as my smol son. \u201cCivility is just lying to people about your true feelings. Hiding for personal gain.Popular people, well, they\u2019re just the best liars.\u201dThe art is not the most beautiful, it uses a lot of pale tones that allow to see more of the dark themes of the story but that don\u2019t radiate astonishing, wall-worthy art. However, this style of art and colour, matches the decade the story is set in wonderfully, demonstrating a grungy feel that made me want to listen to Nirvana in a dark room. There is also the detail that certain panels and issues focus on a different colour, which adds a lot of intrigue as to why they are being used. I will continue to buy the trade paperbacks for this series, luckily, there is only three out, with a fourth one coming soon, so it is not a lot I have to catch up on. The tale of all these kids might just be one of the strongest titles Image is publishing out there, and Image always publishes the strongest comic titles in the industry."}, {"userName": "Nicolo Yu", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/533046-nicolo-yu", "userReview": "This is writer Rick Remender's most personal comics work to date. He may not have written it outright in his afterword to this first volume of Deadly Class, but he intimated as much. The protagonist of Deadly Class is Marcus, a homeless orphaned immigrant who is an outsider in Ronald Reagan era America and the assassins school he enrolled in to escape the streets of San Francisco. As a teenager, Remender was also an outsider in every new town his family relocated and they moved a lot. He got fed up of being an outsider in his own town that he up and left as soon as he got his driver's license.This may be as personal as Remender made it to be but it is ultimately a true collaboration with the artist, Wes Craig. This is the best work I've seen from him. There is this whole sequence where Marcus had an acid overdose and the world the reader saw through his eyes were as trippy as it could be. The reader gets the sense of time and space twisting as your senses cope with the chemical imbalance in your body. Truly a masterpiece Craig has done with colorist Lee Loughridge.The story itself is a dark reflection of the 80's USA, which I sometimes remember as a supercut of John Hughes movies. Indeed, there is this scene when Marcus and his classmates play hooky from school, there's Ferris Bueller's Day Off kind of vibe. Deadly Class is a coming-of-age story, but so far, Remender isn't doing a good job of making me like Marcus.Marcus as a character remains for me to be unlikable. True, his story has yet to play out but I don't feel any sympathy for him. The book is saved by his cast of friends. Like Saya, the Yakuza teen who is still a mystery but hints of a tragedy behind that stoic face; or Maria, the Central American drug mule working herself out of a blood debt or Willie , who is living on a reputation undeserved. The three of them at least makes me want to read more of Deadly Class and hope Marcus turns a corner."}, {"userName": "Dylan Williams", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7023131-dylan-williams", "userReview": "Almost one of the best graphic novels I have ever read!The colouring in this is seriously mind-blowing, and is easily the best part of the series.

A girl pops out of nowhere and helps him. She takes him to a secret place, where he meets a bunch of teenagers and an old guy who tells him that these are his students and he runs a school, a very special school called \u201cMiss Peregrine\u2019s home for peculiar children\u201d \u2026 oh wait no that\u2019s not it\u2026 hmmmm oh there it is \u201cKing's Dominion Atelier of the Deadly Arts\u201d. Ok they have too find a shorter name. I t turns out that every other student comes from a family of criminals or assassins and he is the only one who is not. Of course he is. And things happen but I don\u2019t wanna spoil anything so I stop here.Couple of problems with this one.First of the beginning is almost copy paste from Mark Millar\u2019s \u201cWanted\u201d. 2nd Character clich\u00e9s and 3rd You almost don\u2019t spend any time in the freaking school.

I was worried it would be Harry Potter for assassins, I guess.It wasn't. Not even close.This comic is gritty, hard hitting and doesn't make any excuses for what it has to say. How far will a person go to fit in? Apparently pretty far.This first trade was packed full of some especially awesome artwork - and it fits spectacularly well with Remender's writing. The cast of characters are real people with real issues with real history...it just so happens that we are introduced to them on an LSD fueled road trip of vengeance to Vegas that cyclones into a bloody ending. Okay, so maybe not that real. At least not for most of us.But it sure makes for a heck of a lot of fun reading.

I want to give it 10 stars. I'm hooked. I want to read the next volume now! I don't want to wait!!This graphic novel has it all and more. But no one is super human, no super powers, or out of this world technology. It's just a bunch of high school kids, going through what we all went through in high school. Expect they are taught and tested how to kill, on how to be assassins. It's amazing.
