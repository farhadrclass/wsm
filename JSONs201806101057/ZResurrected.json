I had never read some of these authors and now they are on my list to start reading their series. In the first story I fell in love with the characters. I really cared if they were going to make it. Definitely going to look into that series. The next story was a one person story. She was telling how she ended up by herself and it was written like a diary, almost. I really enjoy books written in that form. The next story was completely different then your average zombie story. The infected were contained separately from everyone else. However there were also non zombies there as well. The government just contains off that part of the world as if they didn\u2019t need to do anything to solve the issue. The Eric A Shelman story was from his Dead Hunger series , which due to how great this short was is now on my TBR. The hero is a guy that had an accident that almost paralyzed him. He worked his way through that and back to walking. Not your average zombie killer for sure. Mark Tufo is the only author I know, that could make me fall in love with a bear! Fall in love I did. This Riley story is fantastic!! I laughed out loud and cried a few tears too. I hope to see a Riley 6 in the future, but was told it might not happen :(The last story was good as well. However, for me it was almost too short. I like a little meat in my short stories. Overall it is a great mix of a lot of talented authors."}, {"userName": "PJ Lea", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41011032-pj-lea", "userReview": "\ud83d\udcdaSerious issues with this book.I tried to read each story, just to be sure, but each one has swathes of words missing which makes them impossible to follow.If this was corrected it would probably be a great book as they are all really good authors."}, {"userName": "Loren", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/286958-loren", "userReview": "I bought this for Dana Fredsti's story, which opens the book. Ashley and her team of team of zombie killers mount a rescue mission across San Francisco. The details are so perfect and right that you could follow in their footsteps. if you wanted. Totally worth the price of the book and a worthy addition to Dana's Plague World saga."}], "description": "In this anthology, six horror authors revisit some of their most infamous zombie characters, resurrecting the undead.
