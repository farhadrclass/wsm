Look at the cover. I bought it because it\u2019s written by a fraternity brother\u2019s sister-in-law. I figured, hell, she\u2019s got the guts to drop everything and freelance fulltime, I should support the cause. I figured I\u2019d get around to it someday, would read about 30 pages, find that it wasn\u2019t my thing (I mean look at the cover!), and maybe let my girlfriend or sister read it or something. And the funny thing is, I\u2019m still not sure why I did start reading it over all the other books ahead of it in the queue. Did I want to get it over with, so I could say I gave it a shot? I have no clue. It was sitting in front of me and I picked it up and started reading. That\u2019s all I know.But God I\u2019m glad I did. It is a beautiful, beautiful novel, and it touched me in a different way than most novels do. From the get-go the narrator was an interesting and likable (though flawed) person; someone that could entertain me, someone I genuinely liked. And Bessette was perfect with the slow reveal: you learn information as you go; slowly your questions are answered and the holes filled. \u201cBabysitting? At thirty-four years old? Well, maybe that\u2019s my widow style. My awesome widow style.\u201d See the personality in the voice? You want to have a conversation with this person. But the quote is revealing, too -- and given the context, completely seamless. I talked to myself while reading, saying weird, embarrassing things like, \u201cI had to get healthy before my heart would grow, so I could appreciate this.\u201d I said that to myself out loud! It\u2019s kind of a \u201cyuck\u201d thing to say: it sounds cheesy, right? But it\u2019s g.d. true. (I also talked like a pirate a few times\u2026.)So why did this book make my eyes moist? And what makes it so beautiful? It\u2019s still coming to me, but I\u2019ll try to impart what I can. Part of it, for sure, is its realness. A story about a widow, whose husband died while helping in New Orleans after Katrina, could have easily been written coldly, in a painfully detached manner by someone who didn\u2019t \u201cget it.\u201d Or it could have been too soppy and dramatic, and therefore unrealistic. It\u2019s the little things that are shown, and over a year after the narrator\u2019s husband\u2019s death, it\u2019s those little things that still affect her and continue to make life difficult.And you know what? That\u2019s pretty much how life goes. Life is full of memory smacks of past situations. Life is the slow reveal. Life is growth; and real growth is always slow. Life is the coffee brewing in the morning, and your dog by your side while you try to cook. It\u2019s those little details of everyday life that we take for granted; that we don\u2019t even realize. It\u2019s calming to be reminded of these things, because as unreliable as life is, there\u2019s much consistency in a day: the wooden edge of the desk will always be so; the evaporation of my breath showing in the cold is always going to look the same. Reliable but then again slightly different: even that desk, despite being the same, will always be a little different too, because you\u2019re always different. Your feelings, your perceptions, are never the same as they were the moment before, and the interplay of all of this is everyday. And that is utterly beautiful. Bessette knows that people aren\u2019t perfect; that things don\u2019t always work out. Yet she remains optimistic; her view of human nature is a positive one. I can tell she loves most of her characters. She gets that the small, unexpected events in life that involve other people are the events that we remember; that those are the events that shape us and impact the trial of our lives, and impact who we are: not the who we are in the moment, but the who we are thirty years from now; that part deep inside us that never fully goes away \u2026 the real us.And life is about the slow aches we hold in our hearts, too, isn\u2019t it? The little aches that never fully go away, but are brought to our full attention through memory smacks. This novel gave me a slow ache in my heart from early on. It was slight, but it never fully went away; just as it never fully went away for Zell, the narrator.Finishing up, I want to say one last thing here. I have to say it, and I think Alicia may read this and hate me for the comparison, but it's what\u2019s in the cage in my chest and it's gotta come out. Her novel affected me the way John Irving novels do. I know, you say she may very well HATE John Irving. And that's fine. I'm talking about affect here, anyway -- and I'm talking about me. I\u2019ll try to illustrate it this way:For me, Dostoevsky and Greene are scotch; Woolf and Kundera are wine; and Irving is beer. And Bassett to me is beer. When I drink beer and read, I want a slow calm -- a reality based, slow moving wisdom. And the reality of this novel -- the everydayness of it when someone has to live with a slight, ongoing sadness, is there. And that ongoing sadness is life. \u201cEJ closes his eyes at the sound of her warm-honey voice. He feels washed with sudden gratitude: Dogs go missing; people fight, divorce, and die; but he can call Charlene any time, day or night, and she consoles him.\u201dYou see, though, life is also full of other people; people that can help us make it through. People leave your life, and new people enter it. But that person you no longer hear on the phone isn\u2019t replaced. They\u2019ll never be replaced: they\u2019re a part of who you are, and they\u2019re a part of your heart. And what you hold in your heart will never fully go away.And you know what? Even that inescapable sadness that we all have, has love in it. And I'll take a slow, wise, ongoing sadness that has love in it, any day of the week. And I think I'll crack open a beer and just think about my life tonight."}, {"userName": "Matthew Quick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2614396-matthew-quick", "userReview": "Beautiful novel written by a beautiful person."}, {"userName": "Evan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237935-evan", "userReview": "Alicia Bessette's debut marries a big social issue with an intimate story of mourning. From the opening page there's a sad edge to the humor found in Zell's narration that neatly highlights both the setting (a wintery Massachusetts's town) and the tenuous bonds between characters that once felt united forever. The relationship between Zell and Ingrid gives the story its best, most emotionally profound moments -- moreso than the romantic moments between Zell and Ingrid's determined but struggling single-dad. I assume Bessette understands that a novel about recovering from the loss of a husband one loves completely would be made trite by a storyline that revolved solely around a love interest. More importantly, though, this is not a book about one connection but many connections -- from the bonds of local townspeople to the unexpected links between people brought together through tragedies big (Katrina) and small (the death of a husband that everyone loved). I read this book in just two sittings, propelled forward by the voice and curiosity as to how things would work out (hoping it would not be a neat, overly sweet finish -- the kind I'm usually not satisfied by when there's a major social crisis involved). As it turns out, I was not disappointed, because Simply From Scratch, despite all the things fiction can 'get away' with, does not pretend to be about a perfect world with perfect people; instead it's a book with the invisible, difficult to vanquish villains of pain and loss. Ultimately, the Katrina backstory involving Zell's husband (whose death is directly related to his time in New Orleans) fits perfectly in terms of tone -- the details of the Katrina aftermath stand on their own and also work as a metaphor for Zell's own life disaster -- how she will have to save what she can from the rubble. While this can be a difficult line to walk, Bessette doesn't leave the reader thinking that Katrina is a convenient contemporary issue that serves her characters. She avoids insulting the survivors of that real tragedy by celebrating survival and community in both storylines. It's a compelling use of the real life moment. In fact, I think the author would be more than capable of delving into Katrina more directly in a future book."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1250107-suzanne", "userReview": "I'm exhausted and spent in a good way. This is the best book I have read in a long, long time and my first 5-star read this year. Though it sounds cliched, I can't think of a better way to say that I laughed out loud, I cried big weeping sobs at times, and laughed and cried simultaneously several times. This novel reached the darkest corners of my heart and warmed them in an almost 'divine union' kind of way. The story was so bittersweet, redemptive, heart-warming, adorable, lovable in every way without ever being sappy or overly sentimental. I'm just absolutely blown away by how much I loved this book. It scares me to think that I randomly picked this up from a sale shelf because I liked the cover - I had not heard of this book and it was sheer chance that put it in my hands. I shudder to think I might not have read this book and how less enriched my life might have been. This book is going on my shelf next to Pat Conroy's The Prince of Tides. Anyone who knows me well will know what a high honor that is. What are you waiting for?!

Zell's husband died a little over a year ago during a mission trip for Katrina relief. She is not a great cook but when her neighbor's daughter volunteers to help her win a contest she can't say no. This encounter may have happened when she almost burned down her kitchen but who asked. The story is light and fun. The romance is really light and not the focus. The characters are fun and they form great friendships, as well as Zell reconnecting with old friendships."}, {"userName": "leslye", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3896845-leslye", "userReview": "Entertaining, light, and fluffy...kind of like a Lifetime or Hallmark movie.

I liked the fact that it wasn't just another happy ending--not that the ending was unhappy, but all of the loose ends weren't tied up in a perky bow.Zell, the main character, is a young widow. Her husband has been dead for three years, yet she can't seem to get past his death at all. She doesn't mix with their old friends, and lives a reclusive life in their home with their adopted greyhound.Next door, a young girl, Ingrid Knox, is learning to cope with life without her mother, who abandoned her at birth. Because Ingrid believe a cooking show host to be her mother, she subscribes to the woman's magazine, and wants to learn to cook.Zell is delivered one of Ingrid's magazine's by mistake, and decides (despite the fact that she knows nothing about cooking) to enter a cooking contest where the award prize is $20,000 in cash--the amount of money her deceased husband wanted to raise to give to Katrina victims. Zell is determined. She wears Nick's camouflage apron and tries her hardes to make something that \"Warms the soul\" as the contest describes. Instead, she causes a fire in her oven that brings Ingrid and her father into Zell's life, and reunites her with many of Nick's friends in the volunteer fire department.Alicia Bessette writes in a way that is tender and honest. When she makes her story about friendship, celebrating life, and being able to let go. SIMPLY FROM SCRATCH is both humorous and touching. As we watch the relationship between Zell and Ingrid and Ingrid's father blossom. Zell begins to unfold, and reach out to old friends, and lets herself be vulnerable once more to new relationships.Zell and Ingrid make it to the finalists with their strange but interesting dessert, but the real prize is in how teaming together for the contests brings these two unlikely characters together. This is a book I would recommend!"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1347210-kelly", "userReview": "Dear Goodreads,First, let me thank you for the free book. You are awesome in so many ways, even Ms. Browning would be unable to count them. That being said, I'm sorry, but I cannot review this book properly. It wasn't because I was incapacitated (though I did seriously consider utilizing this method to make it more fun) or because I'm anti-foodie (though I really don't mind if my burger is cooked at a McDonald's or Little Owl's. Hell, more power to those with a love for food and the preparation that goes into making it). And as far as love and all the emotions that accompany it...people, there is nothing I adore more than L.O.V.E.. My real problem, the sole reason I can't write a review: I can't remember it. It was completely forgettable. Wait, I'm lying. There is one thing I remember and that's the style of writing. I didn't dig it. It was coarse, simplistic, and lazy. That's it. That's all I got. I don't remember loving or hating the plot, characters, etc. Just that it was good enough to keep reading, but ho-hum enough to have made no lasting impression.So, why a 3 you ask? Because I don't love food, I'm not really that big on Chick Lit and because maybe it really all does come down to right place/right time and those reasons deserve to be taken into account.

The chronology of Simply from Scratch really drives it. Certain elements of the plot are left mysterious, and you really do want to know how it ends. I was completely unsure about what Zell\u2019s last present would be, whose Ingrid\u2019s mother would be, and how Nick was killed. I think these mysteries made this book rise above the normal \u201cchick lit\u201d fare and made it more literary.Simply from Scratch also got me when Zell remembered how life used to be. Bessette had the excellent idea to give Nick, the dead husband, a voice. He is seen throughtout the novel in past emails to Zell. I felt for Zell the most in the emails and \u201cmemory smacks\u201d that she relived along the way. I could tell that she really lost something.Now, her \u201cwidow style\u201d-that I did have some issues with. For example, her \u201cwidow style\u201d includes speaking to her dog in pirate-ese. A This language problem continued when Zell referred to her old home-ec teacher. The name was mentioned so much that I grew bored.Simply from Scratch is the debut novel of Alicia Bessette, and I am hoping to see more things from her in the future. While it wasn\u2019t my favorite book, I did enjoy it, and I hope that the features of Simply that I didn\u2019t love can be ironed out in her next work."}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1703640-claire", "userReview": "This is an entirely charming tale of Zell, Ingrid and Garrett amid a cast of wonderful, warm, wacky small-town characters set in snowy little Wippamunk.Zell is still reeling more than a year from the day she learned that Nick died instantly in a freak accident while on a mission in post Katrina New Orleans.

I bought this book at Elizabeth Book Store in Newtown as a bline book (a blind book that is covered with brown paper and just dot points about the book), soI hade no idea what I was going into.This was a cute story, warm your heart like a pie. I wasn't sure if I was going to be a fan of this book, but I started warming to the characters, some parts, I didn't really care for, but understood why they were in the book, it was to add another dimension to the character. I really started caring about Zell and wanted to know what was happening in her life when I was out and about, I wanted to just go home and continue reading and see what recipe she was going to conjure up. I really do recommend this book for a quick sweet read, one that tugs at the heart strings and makes you feel warm inside. Of course if you are a foodie that likes a little romance and friendship's on the side, this book is for you.

As she writes this new novel Simply from Scratch we are overthrown with the illumination of death and the devotion that friends and family have for their loved ones. As we watch Rose Ellen \u201cZell\u201d Roy deal with the death of her husband, Nick, we see her pain and sorrow, yet so much more. In an homage to her husband she dons his camouflage apron and attempts the impossible \u2013baking. A year after her husband\u2019s tragic death in New Orleans Zell preheats the oven and it starts to smoke and burn alerting the fire department and many of her neighbors. The fire was short lived and left the remains of a charred present from her husband- who knew she would never look in the stove-which alters Zell\u2019s existence. Cooking was Nick\u2019s chore and she hasn\u2019t even turned on the oven since he died.Continuing her homage Zell decides to enter the Warm the Soul baking contest in order to donate to New Orleans and the Survivors in honor of Nick. As she sits outside in the snow with her Greyhound \u2018Captain Ahab\u2019 she contemplates her life and the many things she has lost. As her life long friends attempt to console her she cannot cope with what they represent- the happiness she had when her husband was alive. These individuals serve as a constant reminder of her past. In attempt to escape Zell consults with her nine-year-old neighbor, Ingrid, about cooking and baking. Yet Zell connects with Ingrid in more than one way, the two are both coming to terms with their loneliness and contempt. Ingrid\u2019s imagination is wild and alluring- similar to Zell I get caught up in her innocence. After the initial baking mishap the two unite for the Baking Contest- they both have ulterior motives for wanting to win. Yet despite Ingrid\u2019s obsession with Polly Pinch, whom she thinks is her mother, she has little to no knowledge of baking. The two embark on a wonderful adventure rife with ups and downs which complicate their baking needs, lives, and so much more.As I began this novel I was excited about the new interesting topic since none of the books I have read thus far revolve around baking or cooking- which is one of my favorite things. The novel quickly grasped my attention as I followed Zell through her ordeal in search of love and so much more. The small town friendship is something I can sorta remember, while my hometown is by no mean small it is tight knit especially with loss. While many of us can be lost in despair it was nice to see a community gather around Zell as she dealt with her anger and sorrow. As Zell begins to heal she is confronted with much confusion and fear.Throughout the novel Besstte leaves us pondering many different questions about how we would react in a similar situation. Not many authors are willing to explore the grieving process as thoroughly as Bessette did, she was able to examine the issue from many different angles involving many points of view and periods of grieving. To many different people cooking and food are a sense of comfort during a difficult time and that is how Zell attempts to mount her problems. Whether she is cooking what to me seems like a grotesque combination of foods or she is talking in her pirate voice to her Greyhound, Zell is an intriguing and inspirational character. Bessette not only confronts the loss of a loved one but the major issue of New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina. I generally appreciate the diversity of her dialogue from monologues to emails corresponding with her dead husband. We are able to take a glimpse at the inner dynamics of each character.At the close of the novel \u2013following many different baking catastrophes- Ingrid and Zell create something amazing which they coin Scrumpy Delight. Okay so I tried the recipe. First let me preface with the fact that I am allergic to pineapple so I substituted apples instead. It was pretty good! I really loved the combination of cheeses and apple flavor. While you may initially look at this recipe and think gross, give it a try and let me know how it works for you! My favorite recipe for desert is Amy Oh\u2019s Very Best Cookies. I truly loved the humor and relationships throughout the book. I would recommend Simply from Scratch to anyone looking for a heart-warming story of love and triumph over all odds."}, {"userName": "Tanja", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7359604-tanja", "userReview": ">>Diese Rezension und viele mehr findet ihr auch hier: http://wort-welten.blogspot.de/Mehr als ein Jahr ist es jetzt her, seit Rose-Ellens Mann Nick bei einem Unfall w\u00e4hrend seiner Aufbauarbeiten in New Orleans nach dem Hurrikan Katrina ums Leben kam.

Denn w\u00e4re das Heft \u00fcber die Kochshow der Promik\u00f6chen nicht in ihrem, sondern rechtm\u00e4\u00dfig im Briefkasten ihres Nachbarn Garrett gelandet, h\u00e4tte sie gar nicht erst gelesen, dass derjenige, der das Rezept eines einfachen Dessert mit Unglaublich-Faktor an die Fernsehk\u00f6chin sendet und es live im TV zubereitet, 20 000 Dollar gewinnen kann. Genau so viel, wie Nick f\u00fcr die Opfer von Katrina sammeln und spenden wollte.Doch durch den Besuch der Feuerwehr \u2013 bestehend aus den alten Freunden von Nick und Zell, die Zell eigentlich gar nicht mehr sehen will \u2013 lernt sich auch ihre neue Nachbarin kennen. Ingrid, Garretts neunj\u00e4hrige Tochter. Ingrid, die fest darauf besteht, dass Polly Pinch ihre Mutter ist und die fortan gemeinsam mit Zell an einem geeigneten Rezept arbeitet, mit dem sie das Preisausschreiben und damit den Auftritt in Pollys Live-Show gewinnen k\u00f6nnten.Die beiden verbringen immer mehr Zeit miteinander, kommen sich n\u00e4her und nach und nach kehrt Zell ins Leben zur\u00fcck, unternimmt Ausfl\u00fcge mit Ingrid und ihrem Vater \u2013 und \u00f6ffnet noch immer nicht Nicks letztes Geschenk, das die Feuerwehr aus dem Backofen gerettet hat. Als bald darauf Ahab, Zells Hund, den Nick einst abg\u00f6ttisch liebte und damit das einzig greifbare, das Zell noch von Nick geblieben ist, verschwindet, f\u00e4llt sie erneut in ein Loch. Doch dieses Mal lassen ihre Freunde nicht zu, dass sie wieder tiefer sinkt. Nicht, so lange Ingrid da ist und Garrett sie viel zu gern in seinem Leben hat. Von den anderen Bewohnern von Wippamunk, denen Nick ebenso wichtig war wie ihr, einmal ganz zu schweigen \u2026Zuallererst: ich habe die vergangene Nacht fast durchgelesen, weil ich einfach wissen wollte, wie die Geschichte endet \u2013 wegen Ahab, wegen Ingrid, wegen Garrett, wegen allem. Sogar wegen Polly Pinch. Die Geschichte zaubert einem ein L\u00e4cheln ins Gesicht und r\u00fchrt einen wahrhaft nicht nur einmal zu Tr\u00e4nen. Nicht, weil Nicholas Roy gestorben ist, als er gerade mit Zell einen neuen Lebensabschnitt zu begehen gedachte, weil er mit ihr eine Familie gr\u00fcnden wollte. Nein \u2013 einfach, weil er eine geradezu greifbare Leere hinterl\u00e4sst. Im Leben aller. Und weil ihn so viele Menschen geliebt haben.Und aus diesem Grund wirkt es gar nicht abwegig oder seltsam, dass Zell hin und wieder mit sich selbst redet \u2013 Pardon, Captain Ahab redet mit ihr, ihr Kielschweine! Ebenso wenig wie die Tatsache, dass sie ihm E-Mails schreibt und ihm von ihrem Leben ohne ihn erz\u00e4hlt. Von Ingrid, von Garrett und sogar von Trudy, die sie aus der High School einst als alte K\u00fcchenhexe bezeichnet hatten, weil sie gnadenlos in ihrem Hauswirtschaftsunterricht war und die Ingrids Stiefoma ist und neuerdings Skulpturen aus Holz mithilfe von Kettens\u00e4gen macht. Eine Geschichte, die einen nachdenklich macht, zum Schmunzeln bringt und weinen l\u00e4sst."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3043110-stephanie", "userReview": "Dare I say this is book perfection? Simply From Scratch is a flawless debut. I never wanted it to end, and nothing was going to stop me from reading it, not even obnoxious yelling football freaks in my living room who would normally distract (read: bother) me immensely. I sat beside them and read away, completely disconnecting from the world around me and falling in love with the incredible cast of characters.Zell is a young widow. Her husband, Nick, died on a mission trip to New Orleans to help rebuild after the hurricane, and Zell has been lonely, miserable, and depressed for over a year now. Her Greyhound, Ahab, is the only thing that brings her any happiness. She avoids the kitchen, the attic, and fixing the car because they all remind her of Nick. One day, though, fate steps in, and she reads about Polly Pinch\u2019s Desserts That Warm the Soul contest, where the winner receives a chance to appear on the Polly Pinch show, Pinch of Love Live, and $20,000 \u2013 the exact amount Nick wanted to raise for the people of New Orleans. She decides she must enter, despite her lack of culinary skills (cooking was Nick\u2019s job), and win the prize money for Nick and New Orleans. Baking alongside her is her spunky nine year old neighbor, Ingrid, whose in mostly high spirits, despite growing up without her mom, whom she believes is the TV personality and cook extraordinaire, Polly Pinch. Together, they concoct tons of recipes, with Ingrid desperate to meet Polly Pinch, and Zell desperate to win the prize money to donate. Along the way, we encounter a number of people who are enmeshed in Zell\u2019s life, and are trying to help her cope with her tragic loss. Friends, family, and most of all, Ingrid, help Zell rediscover life and live again.So, let\u2019s start with Zell. I loved her. Her heartbreak was palpable through the pages. Without Nick, she\u2019s turned into an empty shell just floating through life. Once in a while, though, her spark shines through, like when she speaks in \u201cpirate\u201d to Ahab. I felt her tremendous sense of loss and desperation. I wanted her hurt to go away. I felt like I knew her.Also, Ingrid. Oh my goodness, Ingrid. Could I adore her any more? I really don\u2019t think so. What an incredible little character she was, and SO full of life. She says things like, \u201cwicked cool,\u201d and refers to Zell as \u201cwoman\u201d quite frequently. She\u2019s a little spitfire, full of determination and love.The other characters were amazing too, but I really loved Zell and Ingrid. This story was SO great. It was sad, beautiful, and full of hope. It had my emotions running in high gear, and I STRONGLY recommend it. This was my first read of 2011, and I can already say it\u2019ll be one of my favorites of the year. I am nothing less than smitten with it.Note: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "LORI CASWELL", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4770012-lori-caswell", "userReview": "More than a year after her husband was killed during a relief mission in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, Rose-Ellen \u201cZell\u201d can\u2019t bring herself to move on with her life. Zell who has lived her life with her meals provided via take out or the microwave. So much so, that her husband could even hide surprises for her in the oven knowing it would never be used.A simple error by a postal carrier changes her life. She receives a magazine touting a baking contest with a $20,000 grand prize. She decides to enter and win and donate the money to hurricane survivors in her husband\u2019s memory. Thankfully after a failed baking attempt that almost burns her house down, Zell meets Ingrid. Ingrid is nine years old, lives next door to Zell with her dad, and Ingrid\u2019s mother is completely out of the picture. These two form an unlikely friendship as they endeavor to win the baking the contest. They both have very different reasons for wanting to win and this contest could change both of their lives forever.Dollycas\u2019s ThoughtsA compassionate look at the grieving process. The author has mixed together the perfect ingredients to turn out a true recipe of hope and light through the darkness of losing a loved one. The new bonds created are real and ring true in a engaging story that may have you laughing one moment and crying the next.The characters in this story are absolutely wonderful. Even the character of Zell\u2019s husband is fully developed and his strength carries on in Zell as she allows herself to grieve her devastating lost. It is true sometimes the best medicine for the hardest times comes from children and our pawed friends. If you are like me and endured Home Economics in high school you will love the Ye Old Home Ec Witch references and how the \u201cwitch\u201d spends her time in retirement. Keep some tissues handy, the entire story will warm your heart and remember a pinch of love never hurts no matter what you are doing.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher.

Zell is a mess and recognizes that. We meet up with her as she tries once again to pull things together and pretend to have more of a normal life in front of her new neighbors. Seeing Zell and Ingrid bond and get into big cooking explosions brings them both back to life and I enjoyed seeing them both open up to the world.I thought the flashbacks and letters interspersed into the story gave it a depth beyond a simple \u201cchick lit\u201d book. Zell\u2019s unflinching view to where she is in the stages of grief makes the book feel more like real life: real grit, real moments of failure and really slow moments of growth. People aren\u2019t perfect and it was refreshing not to have another predictable book with things fixed with a big bow on top. I\u2019d highly recommend this one for a feel good read with a touch of cooking flare.Who should read it?

Unaware that there is something in the oven, she turns it on to preheat, and is soon overcome by smoke. Luckily, the local volunteer fire department shows up, gets Zell and her dog Ahab out of the house, and deals with the fire.Zell is a widow who lives in Wippamunk, Massachusetts. Her husband, Nick, a news photographer, was killed while on a mission trip to New Orleans. She and Nick grew up in Wippamunk, along with most of the members of the fire department. Zell lives in half of a side-by-side two-family home. She has new neighbors in the other half, whom she meets for the first time while she's sitting outside her home waiting for the smoke to clear. Garrett Knox and his nine-year-old daughter Ingrid moved in a month earlier, but Zell hasn't met them because since Nick died, she's been extremely depressed and has hardly left the house.A few days later, Garrett knocks on her door and asks her if she'll look after Ingrid, whose babysitter had quit. Ingrid brings her homework over to Zell's house, and Zell explains about the contest. The prize is $20,000, which Zell would like to donate to a New Orleans restoration fund in honor of Nick. Ingrid is enamored with Polly Pinch, the television cook who is hosting the contest, and since part of the prize is to appear on Polly's show, Ingrid asks if she can collaborate with Zell.Taking care of Ingrid while Garrett is at class twice a week becomes a routine for Zell, and the two develop a bond. Zell still doesn't leave the house much, except to walk her dog Ahab, but spending time with Ingrid (and by extension, Garrett) increases her social life dramatically.This charming story follows Ingrid and Zell as they create many spectacularly unsuccessful recipes for the contest, as their relationship grows, and as Zell slowly begins to heal. Although it initially seems like a sad story about a woman dealing with the recent loss of her husband, it's really a tale of persistence and hope.If you enjoyed The Knitting Circle by Ann Hood, or any of Terri DuLong's Cedar Key novels, you'll love this book."}, {"userName": "Gr\u00fcffeline", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63295319-gr-ffeline", "userReview": "Zell trauert um ihren Mann Nick, der pl\u00f6tzlich durch einen Unfall ums Leben kam.
