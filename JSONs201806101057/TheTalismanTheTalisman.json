To me, it is just the perfect epic hero's journey story. I love that it takes place in the early 80s; I love the grittiness and ugliness of what happens to Jack as he travels back and forth between this world and The Territories, and I LOVE the character of Wolf. The first few chapters are a little slow and not very exciting, but they are important and hold crucial story points that will come into play later, so to anyone reading this for the first time, I recommend sticking it out and reading on...because it quickly turns to great once the story gets going! I could not put it down the first time I read it, which was in 6th grade. This is the only book, besides Catcher in the Rye, that I can pick up and just read a few chapters here and there when I feel like it. I don't need to read the whole book front to back anymore, but I do love just getting that taste every so often. I know I am paid to be a writer for my day job, but here's the thing: It's hard for me to write reviews, since I don't always know how to describe what makes a book \"good\" in a way that is eloquent and persuasive. Despite that, I do just want to make it known that this is, indeed, a VERY GOOD book. Read it. I'm open to discussing it with anyone."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "Twelve year old Jack Sawyer's mother is dying of cancer and the only thing that can save her is The Talisman. Can Jack cross America and The Territories to claim it and save his mother? I first read The Talisman while waiting for the last three Dark Tower books to be published. Thanks to the magic of getting older, I forgot 95% of what happened. When the ebook fell into my lap, I was ready for a reread.Brief Side Bar: This book fell into my lap because Goodreads offered me an ebook of my choice in order to share my notes and highlights. At first, this seemed like a pain in the ass but it wound up being pretty useful when formulating my review. Also, it beat carrying the massive hard cover around like a cave man.The Talisman is a coming of age tale and also a quest story. Jack Sawyer's mom has cancer and the only thing that can save her is The Talisman, a mysterious McGuffin housed in a haunted hotel all the way over on the opposite side of the country. Fortunately, Jack can cross over into The Territories, a fantasy/pseudo-western that exists alongside earth. Still with me?Co-written with Peter Straub at the beginning of the 1980s, The Talisman simultaneously feels like a dry-run for the Dark Tower and a collection of Stephen King's greatest hits up to that point. Jack's trek across the country is not that unlike the ka-tet's journey to the Dark Tower and the Talisman is referred to as \"the axle of all worlds\" on several occasions, just like a certain Tower. King flirted with the concept of twinners in other books, though not by name. I have to believe Jack Sawyer is linked to Jake Chambers in some way. Maybe King didn't think he'd ever finish the Dark Tower so he worked as many ideas from it into The Talisman as he could.The \"greatest hits\" notion I mentioned? Specific scenes seemed like they were almost lifted from other king books. The talk Speedy gives Jack is a lot like the talk Danny Torrance gets from Scatman Cruthers (I know that's not his name but I can't think of it at the moment) in The Shining. You also get King staples like the spooky tunnel. There were echoes of other, earlier King books in the mix that I've already forgotten. Not only that, there were some future echoes as well. The Alhambra hotel, anyone? Also, there were numerous things that would be revisited during various points of The Dark Tower.So where is Peter Straub in all this? Honestly, I can't say since I've never read any Straub solo books. However, there are a few times in the text where the writing lacks a certain Kingliness. I'll chalk those up to Straub. There was some backtracking I didn't care for that I'll also blame on Straub.For a kitten squisher of this size, there wasn't a whole lot in The Talisman that felt like it could be pruned. It takes a long time to hoof and thumb across America and The Territories and Jack Sawyer goes through several hells on the way. Oatley and Sunlight Gardener's boys home were the worst, in my opinion. Give me a railroad trip over a radioactive wasteland over those two places any day.A co-worker of mine said King is at his best when writing about kids. I didn't agree with him at the time but I saw where he was coming from some ways into this book. While I thought Jack, and later Richie, talked more like seventeen year olds than twelve year olds, what twelve year old doesn't want to go on an adventure? I'd visit the Territories now, as a 40 year old kid. I felt for Jack's companions at times but I would also be frustrated trying to travel with Wolf. More than once, I would have left Richie behind, though. When Jack finally reached the Agincourt, I had the put the book down so I could finish it at home rather than sneak read the rest in my cube. The big showdown at the end reminded me a lot of something that happened in The Wastelands. I was also really glad of how the ending turned out, the ending of Cujo still fresh in my mind.The second time through The Talisman was just as enjoyable as the first time thanks to the magic of forgetting. Trial run of the Dark Tower or no, The Talisman is an enjoyable epic and a taste of things yet to come from Stephen King.

Everything comes back, like the moon.\u201dOnly the Talisman will save young Jack Sawyer\u2019s dying mother and he must embark on a quest across America (and into another world) in order to obtain it.I had been anticipating The Talisman since forever, I can\u2019t even put my finger on why, I just had the feeling it would be a book I would fall in love with. And if I\u2019m completely honest, it just wasn\u2019t what I had hyped it up to be in my head. I still REALLY enjoyed it and think it\u2019s a fantastic book, but it\u2019s not a new favourite. *sad face*Jack Sawyer is a great character, he reminds me so much of Jake Chambers, and this perhaps is the problem \u2013 he\u2019s not Jake Chambers. This book also gave me intense Dark Tower vibes\u2026 but once again, this is not the Dark Tower. I think part of the problem is that I was comparing it to the Dark Tower, and it was never gonna come close to surpassing King\u2019s magnum opus, and my favourite book series of all time. I have a feeling that if I had read this first, I\u2019d perhaps have loved it a lot more.Now this opening to my review feels harsh, because I did LOVE aspects of this book and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Wolf quickly became a new favourite King character \u2013 what a sweet soul. \u201cRight here and now!\u201d I really could have done with even more Wolf. I also loved the concept of the Territories and Twinners etc, although it did get slightly confusing at times, especially because some of the Twinners had names that were very similar (which is intentional, of course), but sometimes my brain had to connect the dots and work out who was who. The story also dragged at parts for me\u2026 and I wish we had spent more time in the Territories, because normal earth is just boring in comparison, and I wanted to know more about this different world!!The Talisman is fraught with emotion \u2013 Jack is a very emotional child, who felt very real to me, and his quest to save his mother is so damn brave and admirable. It\u2019s really something special to watch his growth and development as he travels across America. The collaboration between King and Straub felt pretty seamless \u2013 I honestly just felt like I was reading a King book, I\u2019ve yet to read any Straub so can\u2019t really comment if it felt like Straub\u2019s writing, but King was definitely stamped all over this one.I\u2019m honestly so upset that I didn\u2019t LOVE this one, I just didn\u2019t connect with it in the same way I thought I would. I did really enjoy it though, and am looking forward to reading Black House soon!"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "4.5 Stars. Can't classify this one as horror, but THE TALISMAN is one wild and woolly action-packed fantasy ride!\"Traveling\" Jack Sawyer is a good kid and 12 years old when he and his mother flee Los Angeles for New York ultimately ending up in an empty, creepy hotel in New Hampshire; and while Jack questions the moves, he knows deep down his mother is not well.As the days pass and his mother's rest periods become more frequent, a worrisome Jack explores a closed amusement park nearby and is soon befriended by a gnarly old black janitor...Lester Speedy Parker who tells him incredible stories of a parallel world and a magic juice that can transport him to a place where he can acquire the secrets of THE TALISMAN and hopefully save his mother.His danger infested quest from east coast to west with flips from a world of evil doings and enslavement to one with bizarre creatures beyond your imagination has an unlikely friendship for Jack with a 6'5\" Wolf that will break your heart.....it did mine.For me, THE TALISMAN brought back memories of King's Dark Towers series, and while a chunkster at 700+ pages, entices me to re-read it in the form of a graphic novel so I can see the creeping tree roots, the evil abusive bar owner, the camp-school from hell, and visually experience the train ride through the \"blasted land\" as a scared, but brave young Jack Sawyer grows up fast to save his friends and mother and complete his mission.Entertaining and fun read with a young-adult feel to it."}, {"userName": "Dirk Grobbelaar", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3102740-dirk-grobbelaar", "userReview": "Tricksy ReviewThere is so much that happens in this novel, that any thoughts I can cram into one review will always be woefully inadequate.Don't you sometimes think there's more to life than order?Don't you want just a little magic?It is perhaps a good thing to read this book three decades down the line, separated from the hype that so weighed it down when it was first published. 50% Horror; 50% Dark Fantasy. 50% Straub; 50% King, and yet not anything you would have expected from either. The quotes from Mark Twain, that open and close the story, make me think that Jack Sawyer\u2019s surname isn\u2019t coincidental, although I reckon The Talisman is more Huckleberry Finn than Tom Sawyer. There was too much death, the world was half-made of death.The novel requires a flexible mind, and is based on the assumption that other worlds exist just below the surface of the one we all live in. Normally this kind of thing would only appeal to me in a purely Science Fiction setting, what with \u201cparallel worlds\u201d and all that. However, the authors manage to keep things tight, and steer clear of over-indulgence. It\u2019s a story about the fantastical, but it\u2019s also a chilling tale of fear and the macabre. This is not Narnia.He went down the stairs on all fours, silent as oiled smoke, eyes as red as brake lights.As befits any good supernatural Horror story, there are some fearsome critters to be found here. Not all are inherently evil, though, and I suppose anyone who reads this will love the character of Wolf.There was madness here, and walking death, and gibbering irrationality.The transformation of Traveling Jack, from Jack Sawyer to Jack Sawyer, is handled masterfully. It represents one of the most palpable feats of character development I have ever read. There were some sequences that I felt didn\u2019t positively influence the general feel of the novel, but that is my personal opinion. Also, towards the end things get a bit messy; the final, climaxing scenes are interminably drawn out for no apparent reason. This is the only reason I\u2019m not giving it five stars. It\u2019s a story that will probably resonate with me for a while, and I might have more to say on the issue, but not right here and now."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Weird book.The great thing about us residents of the country of READING is that we are a diverse, eclectic bunch. We like and dislike all sorts of different books and for different reasons. Sometimes a few of us will like a book or writer, but for completely different motivations and coming from different perspectives altogether.\u201cIt had great action\u201d\u201cThere was wonderful characterization and dialogue\u201d\u201cIt was a clever allegory and well written.\u201dEtc. etc.And so we come to Stephen King\u2019s 1984 collaboration with Peter Straub, The Talisman. Published a couple of years after King began the The Dark Tower series with The Gunslinger, readers will be drawn to King\u2019s unique style of fantasy \u2013 contemporary without too much gothic and / or mythical elements. There are horrific undertones but almost absurdist in its originality.Like The Dark Tower books, and Insomnia and It, and 11/22/63 and several others of his works, this is about a multiverse where different worlds are connected together by a thin membrane of a boundary, easily crossed.This is about a child and a journey and inspiration was taken from Mark Twain, this is a great American fantasy that may still hold attraction to any of King\u2019s or Straub\u2019s fans around this world. There were villains and monsters and magic and heroes.Our protagonist, Jack Sawyer, goes on a long quest to find the talisman and save his mother. Along the way he finds friends and makes enemies and struggles and cries and almost dies and comes through to confront the bad guys and do what must be done.This was WAY WAY too damn long.I know that is a ubiquitous complaint of mine, and maybe its true I have a truncated attention span but King and Straub took a long time to get to where they were going. I did end up liking it, but almost put it down and by the end was more than ready for this to wrap up. A hundred pages less, hell even cutting it in half, would have made it more enjoyable.I can see where other citizens of our country of READING will like this a lot more than I did, even notice some reviewers who list this among their favorites.

In turn, she shared a quote by Markus Zusak:\u201cSometimes you read a book so special that you want to carry it around with you for months after you've finished just to stay near it.\u201d Only now can I not only fully agree, but appreciate the sentiment behind Zusak's words.. although it's uncertain if he was referring to this particular novel. It's incredibly profound, and they describe my feelings toward The Talisman perfectly. (Thank you, once again, Michelle.) Yet there's more to it than mere magical elements. Much more. At the heart of the story is 12-year-old Jack Sawyer, whose sold purpose seems to be his ailing mother's salvation. In order to acquire that, however, he must venture east.. and beyond. In the days leading to his departure, Jack meets the truly invaluable \"Speedy\" Parker. Insodoing, King & Straub expertly introduces the Constant Reader to him, as well. The duo transports you there, right alongside them. They are long-lost friends, indeed! This being my 3rd reading, they took me on a roller-coaster of a journey which surpassed my considerably high expectations. With that admission, I have another valid confession: I tend to be a very analytical reader, especially compared to my previous experiences with the book. One scene, in particular, stands out as slightly unrealistic: our protagonist's leave-taking. I seriously do not recall having this reaction. Perhaps with age and maturity, we perceive things differently, thus reacting in various ways, I really don't know... Part II: The Road of Trials, is easily a favorite section of mine. As the title suggests, it chronicles the genesis of Jack's epic journey. It's life-altering, as his adventures help form the man he is to become. This is precisely why I love the section so very much. \"..Another light perhaps eight blocks down changed to green before a high dingy many-windowed building that looked a mental hospital, and so was probably the high school..\" The words conveyed to describe the bleak beauty of Oatley are utterly amazing and awe inspiring ..as I believe is evident in the previous passage. The character of Wolf is very memorable (I haven't forgotten him since my first reading, in 1999.) He's beloved, and so masterfully crafted that you can't help the urge to run toward him with a warm embrace. In times of sorrow, joy, or imminent danger, your heart goes out to him. it breaks your heart, really. Well, it did mine, anyway. As the journey continues, the reader is treated with an attribute rarely given by the so-called \"latest and greatest\" writers of today. In Jack, for instance, we learn much about his personal character (as opposed to the superficial,) to the point that it almost feels like an invasion of his privacy. King & Straub delve deep, exposing cherished memories, childhood fears, and the like. Most interestingly, the mind-set of the characters. The juxtaposition between Jack and Richard Sloat still astonishes me. One thought plagued me, relentlessly, and that is, How is it possible for two individuals-who are polar opposite of one another- to be so incredibly close? It hardly seems plausible, even now, yet it's true. Brilliant work, King and Straub! I'd never experienced this before, but at a certain point, I had a genuine Eureka! moment, which commenced with the realization that this duo were clearly influenced by C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia and, to an extent, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. P.491: \"..The coats and suits are gone, the floor is gone, but it isn't crisp white snow underfoot; it's stinking black dirt which is apparently the birthing ground for these unpleasant black jumping insects; this place is by no stretch of the imagination Narnia...\" 492: \".. And later that day, he takes all of his storybooks--The Little Golden Books, the pop-up books, the I-Can-Read books, the Dr. Seuss books, the Green Fairy Book for Young Folks, and he puts them in a carton, and he puts the carton down in the basement, and he thinks: \"I would not care if an earthquake came now and opened a crack in the floor and swallowed up every one of those books. In fact, it would be such a relief that I would probably laugh all day and most of the weekend..\" \" By the fourth and final section, aptly entitled The Talisman, I absolutely loved every word. I though that it couldn't possibly get any better, but I was mistaken... by far. From the Blasted Lands to the very end of their adventures, and virtually everything in between, this one has it all. Excluding the spectacular conclusion, I really enjoyed and have much respect for the chapter centered around Richard's past, and-ultimately- how he deals with it. On a side note, Jack's mother, Lily Cavanaugh, felt very distant throughout most of the novel. I had the impression that she was, in a way, detached from reality. And aside from her debilitating illness, I barely felt anything for her at all. That is, until the end. This development impacted me greatly! If I had a critique to give, I'd comment on the novels' wordiness. And it can be a bit long-winded in places, but its innate visual enhancements make them almost necessary. Hardly a critique at all, eh? Up next, Black House. I haven't read it since the initial HC publication, circa 2001. I remember practically nothing of the text, so as you can probably imagine, I am very much looking forward to this one!"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "One of the things that I love the absolute best about Stephen King's books (most of them) is that they are immensely re-readable, and depending on where is in one's life, or how many of King's other books one has read, the experience could be completely different each time. I have loved this book for a long time. It's a quest, it's a great story with great characters, but more than that, it's almost like a prototype of where The Dark Tower series would eventually go... An alt universe mini microcosm of Roland's quest for the Tower. There's so much to love in this book - except Peter Straub's involvement anyway, which is something that I usually try to forget. It is no secret that I'm not a fan of Straub's writing. I've tried, and failed miserably, at reading two of his books now, and I've decided that his writing is just not for me. Whatever his involvement was in these books, Stephen King made it palatable to me. He blurred the lines and blended the edges so that it seems seamless and painless for me to read. Anyway. This read through I loved it just as much as the last time I read it, but I also felt like I had a better understanding of some of the characters. Jack has always been one of my favorite characters, but this time through, I felt much more empathy toward Richard. This poor kid has gotten the shit end of the stick from life. His father is a dick, he has no mother (took off? dead? Nobody knows. She's not even mentioned.), and his only protection from the insanity of the life his father imagines for him is to delude himself into complete, 10000000%, no exceptions Reality with a capital R. The poor kid doesn't even like fantasy books. Yet, he and Jack had very similar experiences. Both have fathers who could travel to the Territories, and both boys watched their fathers disappear and reappear in very different areas than where they left. The only difference is that while Jack's father left him and went to experience and learn from The Territories, Richard's father went to exploit it. And so their kids' individual experiences of the Territories they couldn't understand were miles apart in terms of experience, and it's all down to their fathers' ideas of what the Territories should be. He had fantasy related PTSD before he could even read. That's got to be traumatizing. I loved Richard's growth though. Even though he refuted and rejected every possibility of what was happening for 90% of his time in the story, the way that he eventually came to terms and acceptance was impressive. I don't know many 12 year olds who could create those kinds of life-changing coping mechanisms, and then break them down in a matter of days. So the fact that he started to forget what happened is either massively unfair to him, to work through everything for nothing, or incredibly just and compassionate. If you were to ask Richard, I think he'd choose the latter. I also felt slightly that Jack was a bit cruel and selfish this time through. His treatment of Wolf and Richard at times was thoughtless for their needs, and it really broke my heart at times. I get that in the greater scheme of the quest and its goals, sometimes one must do things that are cruel, and make hard decisions... But it was the little things, like Jack thinking that Wolf would enjoy a double-feature in a movie theater when he knows that loud noises scare him, and he's never even heard of a movie in his life. Can you imagine how terrifying that would be? Poor Wolf. It's just a small example of how twelve year olds just haven't developed their full sense of empathy yet. Speaking of Wolf... I really hated how he was read for the audio of this book. I loved, LOVED Frank Muller's reading for the first three Dark Tower books, but this one was just all wrong. Everything was so gruff and growly, and Wolf was even more so. It just had the complete wrong feel for me. I'm glad that I only listened to a little bit of the book on audio. Anyway - overall... love this book. Totally recommend it. It's awesome. Go read it. :D"}, {"userName": "Lou", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3699303-lou", "userReview": "Heartwarming journey of self discovery and triumph.

There were a lot of similarities. And don't these horror writers love their old hotels and fairgrounds as settings. King makes use of both in The Talisman to great effect. I enjoyed this book very much but it was a labour of love to read it. At times it became very wordy and occasionally even a little overdone. Too much gruesome stuff and the reader eventually becomes blas\u00e9. I liked the main character, Jack, particularly when he teamed up with Wolf and then with Richard. The humour in their dialogue helped to lighten the horror from time to time.

This book takes all the worst of humanity and shoves it bluntly in your face. Finally, I just couldn't stand the thought of picking the book up to be brutalized by Stephen King's and Peter Staub's writing again. So I didn't.

It's one that I've read numerous times, so I was thrilled when the sequel Black House was chosen for the June 2010 group read in the Stephen King group here on Goodreads, because it gave me an excuse to reread this one. Again. I love Jack. Love. He's so good and pure and honest and brave and willing to do what is needed to do the right thing. I love the way that he starts out scared and unsure and needing a hand-hold, and in the course of three months grows into a strong and confident and heroic force to be reckoned with. But the thing that I love the absolute most about Jack, is that he's still human and still vulnerable. He's willing to give everything up to save his friend - this friend who is the son of the man who has caused all of Jack's misery and suffering. He knows the value of friendship and loyalty and virtue, and he lets nothing sway him from that. I \u2665 Jack Sawyer. I'm gonna have a T-shirt made. ;)There's a lot of realistic darkness and grittiness in this book, but a lot of magic and light as well. Oatley and the Sunshine Home for Wayward Boys are two of the most awful places I've read about in a YA book (which I do consider this to be), but they could both, magic aside, really exist, which makes it even worse. Especially with the Sunshine Home, as my area just had a huge scandal with a Cash-For-Kids program, where a local judge was taking bribes to send kids to correctional facilities to pad their numbers for more state funding, etc. Pretty crappy stuff, but it happens every day. I love that feeling of realism, even though it's clearly fantasy. I sometimes wish that I had a version of the Territories that I could flip off to myself from time to time. I've always considered this book to be a Stephen King book, not a Stephen King collaboration with Peter Straub. I'd read lots of King, but nothing of Straub's before... until recently when I tried to read a short story collection of his. I say \"tried\" because I didn't care for it and didn't finish it. But I bring this up because this time, whether it's simply because I have been on GR talking to friends from the UK and have noticed some of their wording and phraseology, or because I read a couple of Straub's short stories, or a combination of both, I feel like I could see some of the contributions that Straub made here. Simple things like using \"outsize\" instead of \"oversized\", etc. I also felt that some of the more quirky-weird things were probably Straub's -- not that King has any shortage there, but it was just the feeling that I got, and one only has to read the first story in \"Magic Terror\" to see why. The Territories trees for one (A BOY! OUR BOY??), but there were a few things that I felt had the Straub stamp on them. Yet King's hand is clearly ALL OVER THIS, mainly in the characterizations, as usual. I still, to this day, marvel at his ability to make me know and understand a character in just a few lines. For instance, when Richard is describing Reuel Gardener (whose name is a mere typo away from \"cruel\"), he mentions that he \"Sometimes heard really peculiar noises coming from out of Reuel's room, and once saw a dead cat on the garbage thing out in back that didn't have any eyes or ears. When you saw him, you'd think he was the kind of person who might torture a cat.\" (Pg. 443) You can take this line or leave it as is, but as the human pet of two beautiful cats myself, I shudder to think of the kind of person who could torture a cat like that. My imagination gets going (unfortunately) and I think of the way it would be done, and the cruelty that would be needed, and I get sick to my stomach. All from a throwaway passage about a throwaway character. But that's what makes King my favorite. He makes it real, effortlessly.This book does require more than a bit of belief suspension. The main point that this sticks on for me is that Speedy mentions to Jack in the beginning that there are far fewer people in the Territories than there are in our world, so not everyone has a Twinner. Yet almost EVERYONE in the book has or had a Twinner - even the thugs from Richard's school. The odds of that are just too high, and so you really just have to accept it and move on. And then there's the case of Morgan's train, which exists dually in the Territories and America. If Jack boards the train in the Territories in the Outposts (corellating to the midwest), and exits the train in America in California, did the American version of the train start running its course all on its own? Just something to think about... And finally, here are some odd little tidbits I noticed. - The Black Hotel has a kind of consciousness or life, and uses it in a manner similar to the Overlook from The Shining (which was only written a few years before this was published). The two hotels are not alike in any other way, but I thought it was interesting. - George Hatfield, another reference to The Shining, crops up here as a student at Thayer School (where Richard attends), who is in the process of being expelled for cheating. You'll remember him as the stuttering debater who ended Jack Torrance's teaching career in Vermont from The Shining. - The Quonset hut next to the train tracks outside of the Blasted Lands is reminiscent of the Quonset hut in Thunderclap from Wolves of the Calla...- Time zones are mentioned backwards here (there's a mention of Morgan being woken up at 2am California time, which is midnight Springfield, IL time), which could indicate a link to the Dark Tower series, as directions shift... Either that or someone just got really confused. :PAnyway... I really love this story, and I think it will remain a favorite for years to come. :)"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "Alrighty, well, this is going to be a short and sweet review, because I've read this book 73 times and have already reviewed it twice on Goodreads previously, and I'm feeling rather review-lazy today.

Stephen King knows how to tell a story and this is another good example of his talent for world-building and plotting. Having read this, it is amazing to me that this story was not originally intended as part of the \"Dark Tower\" universe because the tie-ins are \"in your face\" for most of the story. In fact, as a huge fan of the Dark Tower series, one of the only reasons that I did not enjoy this story even more is because it wasn't expressly connected to that larger story and so read a little bit like Dark Tower \"Lite.\" That minor gripe aside, this is a great read and I look forward to reading the sequel, Black House, which I understand \"retroactively\" makes the connection of this story to the Dark Tower.

Jack Sawyer has had a life unlike most kids his age, and his wisdom, determination, and just all-around kick-a$$ness throughout the entire novel, show even a twelve year old boy shouldn't be underestimated. I think one of the things I liked best about The Talisman was Jack Sawyer. He's the type of character you can't help but love, not only because of the things I mentioned previously of his character, but, he's so strong, innocent, and I think the type of kid we all wanted to be at that age. He reminds me a lot of Jake from the Dark Tower series, but I find Jack to be so much stronger and I even grew to love his character. The journey itself was also really interesting on its own. Not every journey in a person's life is going to be easy. In fact, it may turn out to be even harder than originally thought. Jack's journey is full of hardship, pain, but the rewards he gained during and at the end of his journey, were worth it. I felt as though, sometimes, as I read, I was going through the same trials as Jack. Every time he suffered, I felt like I suffered, or at least my heart suffered along with him. Jack is such a REAL character, not forced, and written so well. Even though this was a collaboration between King and Straub, I felt this was such a really well-written novel: The writing was superb, but also I felt loose ends were tied, my questions were answered, and I felt as though I went along with Jack on his journey. I feel sometimes all of those things are hard to achieve in novel. But yet again, King (and Straub) shows why he is a master author. The descriptions of scenery, emotion, people, of everything, made me feel as I was apart of these pages myself. The only \"problem\" I had with this book was the character Wolf. At first, I found him to be annoying...extremely annoying. But, I loved Jack so much, and I wanted to see where this journey would take him, I decided to put up with Wolf. As I read on, I actually grew to like him. I don't think he brings the story down at all, because he endures a lot himself. All in all, The Talisman is so well worth the investment to read.

Usually a book isn't quite as magical on the second read, though with authors like King the rating normally stays the same as before.But here, I realize that I underestimated just what The Talisman did for me. More than once I thought that it felt like Tolkien. I was often reminded of The Dark Tower (which I had not yet read during my first visit to the Territories). A Mark Twain boy's adventure even came to mind, blending with the Looking-Glass element of flipping back and forth between the pollution infested tired modern world and one of magical wonder. Fans of Harry Potter should like this as well. Not because of any magical jumping candy frogs or a really awesome sounding name like \"Hermione\", but because this is where a young boy is set on the path to becoming a man.

From the very beginning of the story, I could not get into the plot or even any of the plot devices. It wasn\u2019t that the story was hard to believe, and I don\u2019t have a problem with fantasy, it\u2019s just that the execution and premise of the story was really hard to get in to. Overall, it felt like a patch-work quilt where a collection of short-story adventures were sewn together with 12-year old Jack Sawyer being the single thread. My main problem with the story could be summed up with the following points: **SPOILERS AHEAD**1. Jack\u2019s Mother: The premise of Jack\u2019s mom dying of cancer and letting him leave and travel the country seems a bit far-fetched. If Jack\u2019s mother was near-death and dying of cancer, why would she travel up to a beach house rather than seek medical treatment? I never really got this angle, yet most of the story hinged on Jack leaving his mother to find the Talisman to cure her.2. It seems convenient that it takes 90% of the book for Jack to reach the west coast, and on the way back he gets a car ride that takes a couple of pages. It reminds me of the Eagles from Lord of the Rings which begs the question: why does an adventure story take pages upon pages to tell the quest of a journey, yet the return home has a means that makes it convenient for the characters to reduce travel time by a fraction? Why wouldn't that have been your first option?!3. I didn\u2019t care for Wolf. Seems lazy to have a werewolf as a secondary character and simply name him \u201cWolf.\u201d4. Speaking of Wolf, King/Straub took lengths to describe Wolf\u2019s fear of driving in a car yet at the end of the tale his litter brother is a chauffeur. 5. I could\u2019ve done without the sexual references. When characters are described as having foreskin, erections, and jewelry for their genitals, I really don\u2019t understand how that adds to the story. If anything, I\u2019m distracted and disgusted.6. The main villains \u2013 Morgan Sloat/Morgan of Orris and Robert \"Sunlight\" Gardner/Osmond \u2013 were not as villainous as expected. They seemed very cookie-cutter and stereotypical. 7. Speedy Parker/Parkus was a bit of a confusing character. It was never well explained how he was able to pop-up in random places, yet Jack\u2019s got to travel on foot everywhere he goes. I guess Jack isn\u2019t so special after all. Maybe I missed something in the book, I but it was unclear to me how Speedy was able to show up in all the right places at all the random times.I feel like maybe I am being a bit harsh with \u201cThe Talisman\u201d but after reading The Dark Tower series I end up comparing all of Stephen King\u2019s work to the DT. His DT series was such an epic piece of work that it really set the bar for any of King\u2019s other fantasy/sci-fi stories.Pros: Not many\u2026maybe the sequel will be better.Cons: Too many\u2026the single most being that it\u2019s hard to believe a single, dying mother would let her 12-year old son disappear for an unknown amount of time to an unknown location.Bottom line: Not the best of King and maybe not the worst, but I probably wouldn\u2019t read this one a second time."}, {"userName": "Stepheny", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7091879-stepheny", "userReview": "Guess who finally finished the World's Longest Buddy Read?Me."}, {"userName": "Thomas Str\u00f6mquist", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32669562-thomas-str-mquist", "userReview": "[I know lots of people loved this ambiguous character, I can't help but see Jar Jar Binks with large flapping ears most of the time: \"Meesa Jar Jar!

I remember it being a pretty good adventure story about a young boy on a quest to save his mother, and I remember enjoying it, but I couldn't remember much about it. I'm in my 40s now, older and hopefully a bit wiser, and I happened to stumble upon a paperback copy of the book amongst my vast collection of tomes, so I decided to pick it up and zip through it. I figured, it's Stephen King AND Peter Straub, two really great writers of horror and dark fantasy, so at the very least it was going to be a good yarn. Let me just say that, upon reading the first paragraph, I was immediately hooked in a way that I doubt I was when I first read it (back in middle school? Over two decades ago? Really?). I was actually more than hooked, I was enthralled. Nay, transported, much like the protagonist is transported, to another world. The powerhouse writing team of King and Straub have acheived something wondrous here. Imagine if Tolkein's Middle-Earth and Lewis' Narnia had been discovered by two 20th-century college students. And what would happen if these two college kids, by stepping through that wardrobe door, introduced something horrible into those fantasy realms? What if they infected Narnia with 20th-century cynicism, and they brought drugs and guns and pettiness and hatred and disease? A fascinating premise, one which King/Straub explore in wonderful and disturbing detail. I guess I couldn't remember much of this book when I was a kid because much of it was a little over my 12-year-old head. I get it now. And it's awesome. \"The Talisman\" is more than just a good fantasy yarn. It's a coming-of-age story. It's an allegory about adolescence. It's a story of how jaded and fallen and perverted we have become as a society and a species and how we are destroying our planet and our youth and our hope for the future. It's a fantasy story that Tolkein or Lewis probably couldn't (or wouldn't) have told because it required the perspective of two writers who are used to staring into the dark and yanking the unpleasant (and slimy) things out of it."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "I've never read anything written solely by Peter Straub, so I didn't really know what to expect from a collaboration between him and Stephen King. Honestly, in the end, it just felt mostly like a Stephen King book, but maybe that's because I haven't read any Peter Straub. In terms of the writing on a basic level, The Talisman is a pretty easy read. The flow is pretty good and there aren't any stupidly show-offy words or anything like it. At times it does feel a bit like it could do with some editing, but overall, I liked it.I liked the plot quite a lot. The core principle is something anyone can relate to, really: someone close to Jack Sawyer is dying, and he has to find a cure. The way this plays out isn't so realistic, perhaps -- if one object could cure all ills, life would be so much simpler, after all! But that's fantasy for you. The Territories is a pretty average idea of \"the other world\", which reminds me of Stephen Lawhead's version in The Paradise War, except less Celtic and more... well, American. The worlds King and Straub build up are rich with detail, all the same. The idea of Twinners and the importance of single-selved beings within the story is interesting, and I enjoyed the Jack/Jason thing that spanned throughout. The characters are lovely. The bad guys are all pretty obvious and twisted, it's true, but the sympathetic characters -- particularly, for me, Wolf and Richard -- are amazing. My definition of amazing tends to be \"not perfect, maybe even kind of irritating at times, but somehow I love them so much anyway\". Which is the same for both Wolf and Richard. As for the main character, Jack -- well, he fits the bill, too. The only problem with him was that I could never quite picture a boy of his age acting in the way he does. I kept imagining him as older than he actually is -- fourteen, fifteen, instead of twelve. But that wasn't a huge problem for me.I really, really enjoyed this book, overall. I can see flaws in it, and in places it turned out to be a little too predictable for me, but all the same, all that aside, I loved it."}], "description": "On a brisk autumn day, a twelve-year-old boy stands on the shores of the gray Atlantic, near a silent amusement park and a fading ocean resort called the Alhambra.
