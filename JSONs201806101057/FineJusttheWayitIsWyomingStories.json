Gli indiani, i cowboy, i pionieri. L'America di frontiera, il West, e anche le trivelle in cerca del primo petrolio. I pickup. E una indimenticabile macchia di sudore sul cappello che ricordava le mura di Gerico. E quando qualcuno sta per incontrare un momento di serenit\u00e0 o spensieratezza, il destino piomba implacabile. Un mondo che sembra di conoscere bene, grazie alle varie rappresentazioni artistiche, o perch\u00e9 ci vivevamo anche noi in una vita precedente, o perch\u00e9 Proulx scrive le verit\u00e0 eterne. Un mondo che da queste pagine emerge nitido, tagliente, seducente, terribile. Proulx non usa mai una parola di troppo, e neppure una di meno. Peccato le due brevi divagazioni sul Diavolo, fuori registro rispetto al resto (una delle quali regala il titolo alla raccolta di racconti)."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "I love fiction which evokes particular cultures in a way that captures the essence of a particular place or region. Here in nine stories Proulx eloquently does that for the semi-desert plains of Wyoming, spanning timepoints from the 1880\u2019s to the current era, from a time of the open range and homesteading, to a time of farming growth wrought by the arrival of the railroads, to the current period of oil schemes and cowboys mostly confined to rodeos. Several traditional stories focus on people whose schemes and dreams for carving out a life there inevitably succumb to derailment due to unexpected shifts in weather, economic downturns, foolish choices, and fickle life partners. One tall tale depicts a lonely woman who, after losing a child, takes to treating various pets or farm animals as her baby, then when they die or disappear she makes a sagebrush bush the target of her affections. Over the decades, in a wry approach to magical realism on Proulx\u2019s part, this bush takes on a life of its own in resisting change. Another two stories move even further over the top in depicting the Devil updating his torments for the dead in one case and the living in another. This provides some imaginative comic relief to the darker tales of struggle.Throughout these tales I enjoyed her clear action oriented prose, revealing dialog, and breakouts into lyrical depictions of the beauties and harshness of the environment. If you haven\u2019t read Proulx, some of these aspects, as well as the integration of the comic and the tragic, shine through in the film versions of her novella \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d and novel \u201cThe Shipping News.\u201d Here are a couple of examples of how she harnesses language:The sky dropped over the undulating prairie like unrolled bolts of dirty wool, and even inside the car they could smell the coming snow.\u2018Didn\u2019t you say we were going to have trees?\u2019 Her voice was so light she seemed to have inhaled a ribbon of cloud and to float out her words on its gauzy remnants. But her face was pinched and yellow, and she kept her hands under her buffalo robe.

True, that was pretty much their philosophy. But never has it been so apparent to me all the suffering that lies under that grin up and bear it facade. And never have I read a more depressing story than \u201cTits-Up in a Ditch.\u201d I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever recover. To be born into such a family, then to meet a few people capable of expressing true thoughts and feelings, then to be yanked back home in grief, all that you loved wasted and ruined out of the same brute ignorance that killed your youth, and discover that you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life caring for the war-ravaged body of a man you didn\u2019t love in the first place? What makes the story worth the toll of anguish it takes on its readers is knowing that this really is life for many people, and no matter how much they claim it\u2019s fine, it is not. This dose of reality reminds me that I don\u2019t have it so bad right now. But things could get worse. It challenges my complacency.

Do I rate on the quality of writing, the quality of the stories, or how they made me feel?Proulx excels at writing about rural life\u2014in describing the environment, people and regional dialects whether on the shores of Newfoundland in The Shipping News, Texas and Oklahoma in That Old Ace in the Hole, or rural Wyoming of her Wyoming Tales. For example, in this collection describing the drought of a Wyoming summer in Them Old Cowboy Songs she writes: \"July was hot, the air vibrating, the land dry like a scraped sheep\u2019s hoof. The sun drew the color from everything and the Little Weed trickled through dull stones. In month even that trickle would be dried by the hot river rocks, the grass parched and preachers praying for rain.\"In the same story she describes some of the cowboys of the Karok ranch: \"Men raised from infancy around horses could identify salient differences with a glance, but some had a keener talent for understanding equine temperament the others. Sink Gatrell was one of the those, the polar opposite of Montana bronc-buster Wally Finch, who used a secret ghost cord and made unrideable outlaws of the horses he was breaking. Sink gave off an hard air of competence. On roundup the elegant Brit remittance man Morton Frewen had once noticed him handling a nervous cloud-watcher horse and remarked that the rider had \u201cdivine hands.\u201dFinally, Family Man gives a feel for Proulx command of dialect: \u201cOne time Joe knocked Harry out, kicked him into he Platte. He could of drowned, probably would of but Dave Arthur was riding along the river, seen this bundle of rags snarled up in the cottonwood sweeper\u2014it had fell in the river and caught up all sorts of river trash...Harry was about three-quarter dead, never was right after that, neither. But right enough to know his own brother had meant to kill him. How couldn\u2019t never tell if Harry was going to be around the next corner with a chunk of wood or a gun.\u201dIt\u2019s no surprise that this the awarding winning writer can write. Why then in this collection of essentially old west tales does she choose to include three throw away tales completely out of character with the rest of the collection, that read like jokes vs serious writing. Two feature the Devil planning updates to Hell:\u201cConstruction workers!\u201d the Devil shouted. \u201cTheir hard hats will melt, the scaffolds collapse unceasingly. Ice cream truck vendors? A hot coal in each scoop of vanilla.\u201dThe third, a carnivorous cactus.Really?And then there is the utter despair with which each of the real stories ends.Family Man\u2014The elderly Ray Forkenbrock laments his father allowing he and mother to live in poverty while fathering and supporting families with several other women across the region.Them Old Cowboy Songs\u2014Young couple homesteading on the Wyoming frontier is forced to separate so the husband can find work. The husband freezes to death trying to return to his wife while the wife dies in child birth.The Great Divide\u2014Proverty stricken family loses father to kick by horse.Testimony of the Donkey\u2014Hiker becomes trapped and dies of exposure on an abandoned trail.And the most miserable of the bunch, Tits Up in a Ditch\u2014Improvished woman marries slacker who abandons her while pregnant to join the military. She later joins leaving her son with her parents. Has her arm blown off in Iraq and returns home to find her son dead and her disfigured and vegetative husband dropped on her doorstep to care for.

I don't remember her novels as being this dark. (And I believe she has something being released in 2015. Don't know if it is a novel. I hope so.) This is the third book of Wyoming stories. Her use of language is astonishing. Her feel for the landscape and understanding of the people she writes about are remarkable. When I think of Mississippi I think immediately of Faulkner. When I think of Wyoming I think of Proulx. And even with the darkness of the subject matter there is a wry sardonic sense of humor in the work as well. She is one of those few American writers that if she brings out a new book I have to read it. I don't know why it took me so long to get to this one. Slipped under my radar somehow.

So, I was all set to get into this book. Though I really tried, I could not follow the stories. They weren't making any sense to me. I couldn't get the plot or meaning and the characters seemed forgettable.

With her blunt, unsparing prose, a fierce intellect and a coal black sense of humor, Proulx can paint a vivid and stark portrait of American life, and nowhere is this on better display than in her Wyoming Stories, where the hardscrabble existences of her characters go hand in hand with the bleak words used to describe them. Here\u2019s how she introduces one of her characters in \u201cThem Old Cowboy Songs\u201d: \u201cArchie had a face as smooth as a skinned aspen, his lips barely incised on the surface as though scratched in with a knife.\u201d There\u2019s a paragraph from \u201cThe Half-Skinned Steer\u201d in  Close Range , the first installment of the Wyoming series, which still gives me the chills years after I first read it.Proulx\u2019s descriptive power is, primarily, what keeps me coming back to the Wyoming stories, even though neither of the sequels has been able to match the power of  Close Range (which also has the distinction of birthing \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d the story the movie was based on). To tell the truth, each installment pales in comparison to the one that preceded it. Proulx has a fascination for fantasy elements that pop up in her stories that doesn\u2019t entirely suit her style (at least not when she\u2019s writing about the devil, who puts in a whopping two appearances in  Fine Just the Way it is ). \u201cThe Sagebrush Kid,\u201d about a man-eating, giant-size sage plant, captures something of a Twilight Zone vibe that makes it work, and still almost the entire middle section of this collection is taken up with the weakest form of Proulx\u2019s writing. Compare this to only one out-there story in  Bad Dirt , and hardly any in Close Range.The bookends of  Fine Just the Way it is  are where it truly shines, and sure enough those stories are the ones that play to the intention of the Wyoming stories the best: slice-of-life vignettes that capture the essence of the hard living in such a violent, unpredictable location and the tough breed of human that it takes to live there. \u201cFamily Man\u201d opens the collection by spotlighting Ray Forkenbrock, closing out his life in a retirement home and wondering just where the honor in his existence has gone, if there ever was any. Proulx closes it with \u201cTits-up in a Ditch\u201d (which just might be the best name of a short story ever, although the meaning behind the title makes you feel bad for the immature giggle it gives you when you first catch sight of it), about na\u00efve young Dakotah Lister, who enlists in the army and gets sent to Iraq after a failed marriage leaves her with no job prospects and no way to pay for the son her soon-to-be-ex husband left her with. While there are some winning moments in between, it is these stories that are the real winners in this collection. Aside from the fantasy element that bogs down at least three of the stories, \u201cDeep-Blood-Greasy-Bowl\u201d feels like a research project more than a story (indeed, Proulx pauses to explain that the impetus of the story was the discovery of an ancient fire-pit on her property and the research into Indian buffalo hunting that followed). All in all, this is an uneven collection for Proulx, a supremely talented writer who may have been looking to shake things up a touch in her third visit to the Wyoming territory.

Conoscevo l'autrice perch\u00e9 sapevo che da uno dei suoi racconti di Storie del Wyoming \u00e8 stato tratto il film I segreti di Brokeback Mountain e, siccome sono affezionata in particolar modo a questo film, ho voluto leggere qualcosa di sua creazione.Ho sempre amato questo posto \u00e8 una breve raccolta di racconti ambientati perlopi\u00f9 nel Wyoming, terra indomabile, selvaggia e abitata da persone semplici che conducono una vita abbastanza ordinaria. Le descrizioni del paesaggio sono la cosa che pi\u00f9 ho amato di questo libro - sar\u00e0 dovuto anche alla mia predilezione per la montagna in generale. Si tratta di grandi campi brulli, rocce, cieli colorati, arbusti tra i quali si muovono bisonti, donnole, cavalli e ogni altro animale libero e selvaggio. Essi, infatti, occupano un ruolo di rilievo in alcuni di questi racconti, perch\u00e9 sono legati alle persone da un rapporto di vita e morte. I protagonisti sono donne e uomini semplici, la cui unica ambizione \u00e8 quella di poter vivere una vita rispettabile, senza troppe pretese, ma felice. Essi si adoperano per \"costruire\" la tanto agognata felicit\u00e0, ma il destino bussa sempre alla porta delle loro povere case e crea scompiglio. Il loro modo di agire, il pi\u00f9 delle volte, provoca un sorriso nel lettore.C'\u00e8 un filo conduttore comune che lega quasi tutti i racconti anche se ambientati in decenni diversi.

Within six months after each years winner is announced, I read one of the recipient's books. Most times I am moved by the richness of the stories and the quality of writing. While indeed great, they do not stand out against her work. She composes in this rarified league.

For these characters are striving after the idealised American Dream or that idealised Dream has passed them by forever really. Life is tough, yet there is an acceptable, sometimes intolerable, resilience and persistence among these characters that, yes, life is a bitch and it is a daily struggle. This is the other side to America. The America we are not used to hearing in the positive propaganda peddled by politicians. Yet, these are very real loyal American citizens leading real lives in today's America. The recession and Iraq make their visits in themes. Many of the stories, while downbeat are emotionally touching and not lacking in black humour, not least the excellent \"Tits-Up In A Ditch\". Wyoming is tough and it's people tougher. As per all the writing of Annie Proulx, man's interactions with nature, and sometimes man's struggles with nature, are vividly described and vital to \"getting\" her writing style. There are also two stories of darkest humour about old Nick, the devil himself, just to mischievously sow a seed of doubt amongst us atheists and agnostics.

At the end of that journey I'd like say that I think I'd prefer if these two authors were actually one author. Munro has a tendency to describe the most minute variegates of emotion in a single social interaction. The way someone turns their head creates rippled of emotions. On the other side of that, Annie P will tell the story of a girl ignored and abused by her grandparents, yet just allude to the emotional interior of her character.I think I'd like more of a balance from both authors, hence the Frankenstein blend I'm proposing. I found Proulx's plots better, but I preferred some of the emotional depth Munro gives her characters. I genuinely love Proulx's novels, and I think in a larger narrative she allows more space for that internal exploration. Is anybody reading something that feels like good blend of these two?

I'm in love with her Wyoming nature descriptions, but at the same time, she seemed a little florid at times for her subject. Like Flannery O'Connor her outlook on human nature, and our ability to carve happiness or even sustenance out of our environments, is unremittingly bleak. In her first collection, I felt the poetry of true tragedy in her characters' misfortunes. However, for a lot of the stories here, the lack of mercy for the characters veered towards the misanthropic. Not, of course, that these hard lives and hard ends need to be sugarcoated, but the litany of mishaps befalling each character seemed to draw undue attention to themselves.Of my favorite stories in Fine Just the Way It Is, two were about young women dying alone in the wilderness.

Who says the short story is dead? In Proulx\u2019s formidable hands, the short story is thriving, a form that is by turns muscular and lithe, perfectly suited to portraying rough lives cut short that she makes so entrancing and heartbreaking. Proulx\u2019s third collection of Wyoming stories, Fine Just the Way it Is, includes several tales that are masterpieces on par with her best-known tale, \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d and one, \u201cTits-Up in a Ditch,\u201d that has to be in early contention for status as a classic of America\u2019s Iraq war period. Proulx\u2019s prose has never been better, infused with a specificity of landscape and emotion and marked by distinctive yet clear diction, such as in one story when a cowhand who was being unusually chatty and helpful realized it and \u201cgrouched up.\u201dStrictly speaking, not all of these nine stories are set in Wyoming\u2014two of them occur in Hell. But the reader can be hard pressed to tell the difference between these locales as Proulx skips capably through time, setting her characters up in forbidding pioneer landscapes or in circumstances in which the harsh economic conditions limit the characters to dangerous occupations. This narrative seems to be continuous from the state\u2019s founding to today, with the military or the oilrigs as its primary options for employment, a choice that faces Dakotah, the young female protagonist of \u201cTits-Up in a Ditch.\u201d It\u2019s telling that the two funniest stories in the collection are those set in Hell.Proulx has usually been known for her male protagonists, but many times in this collection it\u2019s the women who emerge as the strongest and most haunting characters. This is especially true in \u201cThem Old Cowboy Songs,\u201d a tragic love story of the sort Proulx does so well, set in 1885, when Archie and Rose McLaverty marry young. Archie, a cowpoke with a \u201csinging voice that once heard was never forgotten,\u201d was orphaned as a boy and left with no family on the Wyoming frontier following the death of the woman who took him in. Rose\u2019s father moves away with her bedridden mother shortly after the young couple is married. In her epigraph to the story, Proulx writes, \u201cThere is a belief that pioneers came into the country, homesteaded, lived tough, raised a shoeless brood and founded ranch dynasties. Some did. But many more had short runs and were quickly forgotten.\u201d And this couple, young and in love and without family to help them on the frontier, soon are erased.Rose and Archie enjoy a few months of happiness, during which Rose \u201cseemed unaware that she lived in a time when love killed women.\u201d Then Archie loses his job on a nearby ranch and leaves the pregnant Rose alone on their remote homestead while he seeks work. \u201cCowhands rode the circuit, moving from ranch to ranch, doing odd jobs in return for a place in the bunkhouse and three squares.\u201d Archie eventually lies so he can sign on as a cowhand with a boss who doesn\u2019t hire married men, the consequence of which is that he can\u2019t stay in contact with Rose. Proulx embodies the indifference of the other townspeople toward Rose in the character of Flora Dorgan, a former prostitute who becomes the wife of a politically ambitious stationmaster, dresses herself and her stepdaughter in finery from Denver, and lords her privilege over everyone. This community neglect sets up a vivid, harrowing scene in which Rose, alone in her cabin, goes into labor two months early. Battered, bleeding, and barely conscious after her ordeal, she determines to bury the stillborn baby outside, but after she crawls back to the cabin, Proulx writes with the chilling understatement that is her trademark, Rose \u201cheard the coyotes outside and knew what they were doing.\u201dProulx could have sprung from Rose\u2019s sad end to Archie\u2019s tearful realization of it, but she does something far cannier. Archie, too, meets his fate during his rough work, and there is no one to mourn or miss either of them. One friendly neighbor who comes across Rose\u2019s remains concludes that Rose \u201cwas raped and murdered and mutilated by Utes,\u201d but no one in the town seems to care. In this story, Proulx has written a testament to every pioneer who struggled and lost, and every frontier woman who died trying to give birth, whose lives passed unremarked.Between heartwrenching stories like this one, Proulx interleaves moments of levity, with two stories starring the Devil and Duane Fork, his \u201cdemon secretary,\u201d in which the Devil tries to spruce up hell with ever more torturous and nefarious attractions. (Hell offers \u201cstunning vistas of multithousands of refineries, ship-breaking yards, oil wells and methane gas pads stretching to the horizon.\") And in \u201cThe Sagebrush Kid,\u201d which must have been inspired by Annie Proulx\u2019s recent years of work traveling through and describing Wyoming\u2019s Red Desert (her Red Desert: History of a Place is due out in November from University of Texas Press), a barren couple nurtures a sagebrush that looks like a child, and the sagebrush endures for decades in the Red Desert to become perhaps the region\u2019s only man-eating plant.In \u201cDeep-Blood-Greasy-Bowl,\u201d Proulx builds on the anthropological discoveries found during the construction of her house to create a vivid, detail-rich account of a tribe\u2019s buffalo hunt in the centuries \u201cbefore the Indians had horses or bows and arrows.\u201d Even in those days, Wyoming was a perilous place to live. In \u201cTestimony of the Donkey,\u201d one of the three stories set in present-day Wyoming, Proulx introduces a couple who will be familiar to all who live in one of the outposts of the new West, who love the endless hiking opportunities that the landscape provides, but long for sustenance beyond iceberg lettuce. A quarrel sets up a dangerous solitary hike, and the outcome highlights the \u201coverwhelming indifference of nature\u201d that Werner Herzog spoke of in his documentary \u201cGrizzly Man.\u201dApart from \u201cThem Old Cowboy Songs,\u201d the real stunner of the collection is \u201cTits-Up In A Ditch,\u201d which introduces readers to Dakotah Lister. Life comes at her hard from the moment she\u2019s born to a teen mother who leaves her in the care of her unloving grandparents. Proulx writes of Dakota\u2019s grandmother, Bonita, \u201cRanch-raised and trained, she counted the grandchild as a difficulty that had to be met.\u201d Dakotah\u2019s grandfather Verl is impaired from his time as a bareback rodeo rider, and he and Bonita raise Dakotah grudgingly, without a bestowing her a single hug. Dakotah marries straight out of high school, finds she and her husband are ill-suited for each other and they decide to divorce, just before she discovers she\u2019s pregnant. Dakotah\u2019s husband enlists, and upon Bonita and Verl\u2019s urging, Dakotah does too, leaving her infant son behind with them while she heads to Iraq. The end of the story is devastating, as Dakotah returns home to a scene of loss, realizing that \u201cevery ranch she passed had lost a boy, lost them early and late\u2026\u201d \u201cTits-Up In A Ditch\u201d is so carefully crafted and filled with striking detail that you can\u2019t help but believe it, and that stories like this are occurring every day among families sending their sons and daughters to Iraq.Proulx is a great novelist, but she is such a master of the short story that I\u2019m rooting for her to continue in her current vein and produce even more collections of Wyoming stories. When they\u2019re this good, why stop at three?"}, {"userName": "Azzurra Usher", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58839407-azzurra-usher", "userReview": "Una rassegna di storie crude e selvagge, esattamente quanto pretendevo e mi aspettavo, con lo sfondo ipnotico del maestoso Wyoming. Ma il dolore, quello di cicatrici forti e pulsanti, di morti crudelissime o di vite spezzate in maniera ineluttabile mi ha, volta per volta e racconto dopo racconto, sorpresa e forse un po' incupito. Ho letto il libro indolente, forse proprio perch\u00e9 ogni storia (tranne quelle brevi ed ironiche che parlano del Diavolo) deve essere somatizzata lentamente. In alcuni casi le scene sono fortissime e le descrizioni che ne fa l'autrice cos\u00ec vivide da farmi sobbalzare. Alcuni episodi mi hanno riportato alla memoria amori struggenti narrati nelle sad ballads, o addirittura in alcune canzoni di Nick Cave. - Un padre di Famiglia Un uomo anziano fa i conti col passato oscuro della sua famiglia- Ho sempre amato questo posto Diavolo 1- Quelle vecchie canzoni di cowboy La struggente storia di Archie e Rose, e del pi\u00f9 freddo degli inverni.- Il bambino di Artemisia Alcune strane sparizioni nei pressi di una pianta molto amata.- Il Great Divide La storia di Helen e Hi e della loro famiglia, di un sofferto trasferimento e di un beffardo ricongiugimento. Tristissimo.- Grande-ciotola-unta-con-sangue Stagione di Caccia. - Lo scherzetto della PaludeDiavolo 2, dispetti. - Il Testamento dell'asino O anche, le conseguenze (terribili) dell'amore. Una separazione fatale, un orgoglio ferito e una foresta che non perdona la solitudine. - A gambe all'aria nel fosso La storia di una donna, Dakotah, di una vita che pare immolata al dolore e che non pu\u00f2 conoscere un bagliore di serenit\u00e0. Come ultimo racconto, \u00e8 abbastanza potente. 3.8 Triste e incisivo. Annie Proulx ci introduce in un mondo di provincia americano oscuro e ci narra realt\u00e0 sinistre e segreti tormentati, il tutto ambientato in una Natura altrettanto affascinante e crudele.

Other than that, it's a solid third volume in Proulx's Wyoming Stories series. A family history project in a nursing home uncovers painful old stories. An underage homesteader marries and covertly works on a ranch where no married men are allowed. A young woman takes a dangerous solo hike. A teenager tries to build a life off her grandparents' subsistence ranch.

Flowery descriptions of Wyoming's stark beauty grew somewhat tiresome. Proulx's jabs at the environmental evils of mining, farming, ranching, basically any endeavor providing humans with sustanance, were bad enough but 2 stories with Satan behind the destruction of planet earth were just silly environmental polemics.

The rest of the stories seemed to me to be efforts to put as much harshness, meanness, hopelessness, bleakness as possible into each story. Life is hard and life on the frontier according to Annie is terrible with no visible signs of support. Families with no jobs, no work, no crops and no money still seemed to survive. But there were no reasons to continue to live, work,educate, or strive except for the inertia of life.
