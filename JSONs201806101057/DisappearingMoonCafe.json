The story hops between past and present, slowly piecing together all the dirty family secrets (suicide, adultery, incest..). The novel is very plot-driven, and I found myself losing interest because the characters were very flat - like stepmothers in a fairy tale. The elements of historical fiction were interesting, and Sky Lee seems to want to drive home issues of racism for the reader. But without the depth of characters, the hardships of chinatown read more like a textbook (boring!). The strength of the novel is really in the way it unfolds the tensions and passions in mother-daughter relationships. The rivalry between each generation of women ties the fragmented tale together nicely, and gives a unique perspective on women's positions in Chinese-Canadian culture throughout history."}, {"userName": "Cecilia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5961119-cecilia", "userReview": "Weirdest book ever. I actually read the first half, but I scanned a significant amount of the second half. The family drama part was interesting, but the suicide, murder, and racial tension plots weren't. The family tree was ridiculously confusing and since there were so many characters, I didn't feel like I really got to know any of them, though Lee does an admirable job of character development with beautiful prose. The one good thing about it was the lyrical prose and literary elements. If you can get past being thrown around from one generation to another, and back again, and the boring historical parts (that really weren't as well integrated as they should have been), it's a decent read, though I personally didn't really enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Lbaker", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5182359-lbaker", "userReview": "At first I was having a hard time keeping names and characters straight, but after a while and after flipping to the useless family tree at the beginning I just didn't care anymore. The characters were inter-changable, female characters were weak when young and nasty when old, male characters were weak all through. The lovers were sad and the lives of these people unreal. I did not get attached to any characters deep enough to care if their life fell apart, if they killed themselves or just ruined their or their families lives, they were unreal, unlikable, and just sad. The Concubine's Children by Denise Chong is a much better book, and is non-fiction."}, {"userName": "Mark Lisac", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1554782-mark-lisac", "userReview": "If 2.5 stars had been a choice I would have given the book that rating, reflecting my ambivalence about it: I liked parts of it and wanted to like it more, but found reading it also produced much tedium and disappointment. Decided to lean toward 3 stars to recognize effort and ambition.It looked promising because of the descriptions of it as a classic and because of the prospect of learning something about a Chinese-Canadian point of view. It did deliver glimpses of that particular community and of how Canada can look to one writer from that background.It also delivered contradictions and dead ends. A powerful symbolic start involving a search for remains of dead Chinese labourers shrivels into a passing anecdote. Oppressive and driven mothers are swiftly explained in the end as the products/victims of a patriarchal society (not an unknown phenomenon but the connection is not well made). A real-life racist incident stemming from a Vancouver murder in the 1920s makes an appearance in the story, disappears and then is suddenly and rather awkwardly brought back toward the end.The biggest disappointment is the writing. What begins as an omniscient third-person voice blurs into a first-person narrator's voice and then occasionally blurs back again. The writing style itself often feels kitschy. It isn't clear whether that is Lee's own voice or the imagined voice of the character doing the narrating/imagining. Two short excerpts will serve as an acid test. If you like these you may like the novel, but if not \u2026 :\"There, she found a part of brand-new scissors \u2026 All these long years, she had totally forgotten about them \u2026 These she picked up with a rather deliberate gesture, then turned threateningly to her torturer. Mui Lan took fright and flight. She almost made it out of the bedroom, but Fong Mei dragged her back with the strength of ten madwomen.\"And: \"There I was in Chinatown, a lovely young female with a body that hungered beyond my control, surrounded by this restless ocean of male virility lapping at my fertile shores.\"This 2017 reissue of the 1991 original includes an academic afterward and the transcript of another academic's interview with the author. Both sections offer interesting views of how specialist academics can interpret the world in a highly formalized, carefully modulated way (E.g., Canada is split between an \"indigenous\" society and a \"settler society,\" as if every non-indigenous person springs from a class of homesteaders; and there's the standard embrace of puns like \"pain of glass\"). The academics and even the author also seem to hold an artificially constructed view of the novel, one quite separate from its direct reality as a story written for and encountered by a mass readership."}, {"userName": "Jenny Chan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12628883-jenny-chan", "userReview": "Disappearing Moon Cafe was interesting to me, especially as a second generation Chinese Canadian, in that it worked within an \"undertold\" history and sought to tie the connections and experiences of Chinese across generations. I actually appreciated the jumping between persons and times\u2014the non-linearity of time was important to building upon the meaning and plot of the book. And after finishing it, I wanted to pore over the pages, trying to find clues and connections towards the endings. I was disappointed though that the history wasn't better articulated or contextualized, because this story was an opportunity to tell that in a captivating way. And I agree with some of the critiques that the characters sometimes felt flat. I also worried that the characterizations of Indigeneity were even more one-dimensional and felt more justice could've been done to that history and Indigenous and mixed folks.

What fun.This was an interesting kind of book. Although...I can't say for sure if it was the good kind or the bad. This book was set in Vancouver and written in chunks...or, unchronologically. And this just made reading the book plain weird. Or, confusing.Kae, the narrator of the story...has a very messed up and complicated family history, and this novel follows her as she tells of her ancestors' troubles. Frankly, not all the stories were interesting, but I did like Fong Mei's (FM) parts quite a bit.So...let's see...if I could summarize the problems here...We have a girl, FM, specially brought over from China so that she could have a kid with this other guy (CF)...but it's been five years, and still no kid. So the mother (ML) of the guy (CF) decides FM is infertile and arranges for another woman (SA, who has had kids before) to secretly try to have kids with CF. But months have passed...and STILL NO KIDS. CF finally comes to the conclusion that HE is the one that can't have kids, so he tells SA to secretly have babies with someone else (W). Meanwhile, FM decides that she won't just stand by idly, and decides to have babies with a friend of hers (TA)...which happens to be a half-brother of her husband (CF). And if that isn't messed up enough for you, their kids know next to nothing of this...and they fall in love with each other. HAVE I SUCCEEDED IN MESSING IT UP ENOUGH YET?It's crazy, I know... And I had to read it. And answer more than a hundred questions on it. FUN.Aaaanyways....I liked the swearing...no, don't look at me weird. The swearing in this book came as a pleasant surprise to me, because just the other day, my mom taught me some swear words in Foochow...and they sounded eerily similar to the swear words spoken in this book. Awesome, right?Reading about the tragic history of this family was also fascinating because...I'm Chinese, too. My English teacher has made me read novels on Aboriginals, on Vietnamese, but this is the very first novel about CHINESE! Yay!And surprisingly, the order of how the stories didn't confuse me as much as I thought it would. But...what DID confuse me a little...was the narrator. I was almost always questioning who was narrating the story....*sigh*And another thing...there were a few parts where I found myself unimaginably bored with the events taking place...or I had no idea what I was supposed to be taking from the actions going on between the characters...the questions didn't help, either. Ah wells.BUT! I'm really looking forward to the 20 paged personal narrative I'm going to have to write! Yay!All in all...not my kind of book (obviously), but not bad...I enjoyed the Chinese aspects of it."}, {"userName": "Lesliemae", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1360749-lesliemae", "userReview": "January 2009I have finished reading this book for the second time and am contemplating it more this time in the manner of maps/genealogy/cartography - basically ways that people have solidified and legitimized their existence, place and by extension identity. However, maps hardly represent the true story behind their creation. I'm looking into some theory dealing with the legitimizing but also fictionalizing aspects of mapping out your existence.Book is more interesting from this standpoint.August 2008I'm not sure how I feel about this epic story of 3 generations of Chinese women living in Chinatown in Vancouver. I guess I found it interesting in that I always kind of wonder about other cultures.p. 254: Do you mean that individuals must gather their identity from all the generations that touch them - past and future, no matter how slightly? Do you mean that an individual is not an individual at all, but a series of individuals - some of whom come before her, some after her?Inscription (August 2008):Living authentically may be an impossible task when the whole of society is bent on creating the false reality of a career centric life as the most meaningful. Every person, then, is a slave to money. To wake up to humanity inside means forsaking a main stream existence and all of its superficial values. You must pursue the anti-American dream. You've got to somehow \"keep it real\".Being real in this way is not an easy thing to do as we live in a culture that often shows us images of physical and material perfection. As a result, we all want to look younger, thinner, wealthier, and more successful. We are rewarded externally when we succeed at this masquerade, but people who are real remind us that, internally, we suffer. Whenever we feel that who we are is not enough and that we need to be bigger, better, or more exciting, we send a message to ourselves that we are not enough. Meanwhile, people who are not trying to be something more than they are walk into a room and bring a feeling of ease, humor, and warmth with them. They acknowledge their wrinkles and laugh at their personal eccentricities without putting themselves down.The people around me on the street are not necessarily bad people, only more or less sucked into the deception."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Swapp", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4038247-jennifer-swapp", "userReview": "My preparation for my trip to Vancouver, BC led me to this book. It was a heart wrenching book, not allowing for much hope in the arena of human nature. I did learn through the process of reading the book a lot of the Chinese migration to the Gold Mountains- both CA and BC. I didn't know there was such a large pollution of Chinese in the vAncouver area. I was stunned by the seemingly cruel way in which the women would speak to their children, and daughter-in-law, yet it seemed familiar. It reminded me of The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mom, and her reference to the name-calling that can be characteristic in Chinese homes. I'm not sure if this is a cultural aspect, or if the combined trauma of relocation at a time of prejudice and suspicion of Chinese immigrants and being a woman in a society that seemingly undervalued women coalesced to create for meanness. It seems there is a lot of literature regarding the relationship among generations of chinese women, and the trauma that is carried down through the generations, often by virtue of the lack of power the women felt."}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4130185-lesley", "userReview": "This is a really great read. Fortunately, I think I got more out of it because of the class I'm currently taking. At first, I didn't understand why incest had to play a role. However, upon learning more about the History of Chinese immigration in Canada, it all made perfect sense. As there were few to no Chinese women around and there was no new immigrants coming, it was inevitable that the pool would shrink. I also learned about the history or Chinatowns and that hoped the story make more sense also.Apart from that, I really enjoyed the way the story was told and how the different characters were interwoven.
