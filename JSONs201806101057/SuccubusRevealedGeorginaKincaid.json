Nothing much except Georgina's personal woes propels this series' finale. The book starts on a fairly ridiculous note - Georgina for some unknown reason works as a Santa helper at a mall. Continues in the same ridiculous way when she and her gang of friends are forced by Jerome to participate in a bowling tournament with another demon's crew. Things start picking up when Georgina is suddenly transferred to a new location - Las Vegas. Only then does our succubus start questioning why the Hell is so involved in her business. And then spends entirely too much time on unveiling the transparent mystery surrounding her contract...If you have read previous 5 books in the series, you know exactly how it all will end. No surprises, no new revelations. All elephant-size clues given by the author prior come together to culminate in the ending 99% of us expected. Satisfying? Yes. An exciting reading experience? NO.The book is not entirely a waste though. It is a one long series' epilogue, a farewell to the characters of sorts. Melancholy and bitter sweet, with a few touching moments. All in all, this series is not a bad one (if you are willing to overlook the fact that the main characters are morally rotten and never truly atone for their indiscretions), but a couple books too long. Richelle Mead's mistake here is that she stretched her story way too thin, especially in the last two novels that are almost void of mystery and consist mainly of relationship melodrama.As for Georgina, I will let Jerome speak for me: \u201cYou know, I might miss some of your witticisms when you\u2019re gone, but one thing I won\u2019t miss? Your overwhelming sense of melodrama and despair. It\u2019s too much even for me.\u201d"}, {"userName": "\u2654 Leah.

It's okay, no spoilers :)This was a wonderfully, beautifully, perfect end to this series. It had everything that I've come to love from the Succubus series: a mystery, witty dialogue, my favourite characters and sex, of course. Things drew to a brilliant close that was dramatically fitting for a series of books that have kept me so thoroughly hooked throughout. Something huge is discovered that would be insane when told by some authors but is cataclysmically awesome when handled by Richelle Mead.Don't you just love it when you arrive at the final installment in a series and there's this great big pulling together of all events and happenings of the previous books? When everything ties together and it becomes apparent that small matters all counted towards the bigger picture and the author knew how it would all come together and explode into an extraordinary climax from the very start. Like, if you read my updates you will see where I mentioned the lengthy dreams in book 5. I thought it was a case of the author finding something to fill the time because her series was running out of juice - oh, apparently not.Lots of mysteries get solved and questions get answered, all remarkably told in Richelle Mead's quirky and addictive style. And if you felt that you were losing faith in some of the characters you'd previously loved at the end of the last book, then don't worry, Succubus Revealed restored all my old feelings for Georgie, Seth and their quirky mortal and immortal friends. Personally, I felt that this book could not have been better, it's my favourite of an extremely enjoyable series.And the conclusion is both happy and sad... bittersweet I think is most appropriate. I will miss these novels very much."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2016128-shannon", "userReview": "My four-star rating is more for the series in general, so take that as you will. Succubus Revealed is mostly a two-star book that contains a couple of heart-wrenching four-star scenes with five-star characters whom I've grown to love. I did have some problems with this book, and one of my biggest ones was all of the side trips that were seemingly tied to one another, but were knotted together so haphazardly. Some things got resolved, others didn't. Some side stories made sense and seemed meaningful, while others were throw-aways.Can someone explain to me why they all went bowling? ::scratches head::Even though we were hit over the head constantly with \"clue-by-fours,\" there were still some intricacies that I didn't see coming. You know how it's all going to end, but still ... but still. There are a couple of shockers in the end that I think even the most attentive will be surprised by.Georgina was probably the most likable in this book out of the whole series, and the supporting characters were all fantastic - more so than usual. Carter! Carter. He is such a great character. I want him to have a spin-off, I really do.I'm content with this one and its ending, although I know some people won't be. I always liked Georgina, I never hated Roman or Seth, and I enjoyed watching the story unfold even though I knew where she was taking things. I'm sad to see the series come to an end, but it's satisfying that she gave it a conclusive ending instead of stringing us along for umpteen books, (some would say the previous book was practically filler and unnecessary, but I digress ...)I have a hard time abandoning a series regardless of how I feel, but I think if you even remotely enjoyed the previous books and the characters, you owe it to yourself to see how Georgina's story ends. I can't say you'll be happy with the outcome when all is said and done, but you will be glad it's over."}, {"userName": "Annie (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489554-annie-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "There are two things that Richelle Mead does amazingly every time. The first is that she is able to end a series perfectly. Whether it be ending an epic Young Adult series or an Urban Fantasy one, Mead knows exactly how to satisfy her readers after bringing them on a rollercoaster ride.Succubus Revealed is the sixth and final book in the Georgina Kincaid series and while I\u2019m glad about what happens in this book, I\u2019m still sad to see it end as a fan. The book starts out fun and light-hearted, hitting the high notes with lots of jokes and silliness. But there is that usual angst that comes with Georgina. As they say in the book, Georgie can be a little melodramatic. But the woman has a reason to be!Right when her world seems to be perfect, she gets a notice of transfer from Hell. Wondering that the hell brought this on, Georgie recruits her friend, Roman aka The Nephilim to help her figure this out. But the real mystery is how Seth knew Georgina\u2019s real name from the fifth century...This answer and more is revealed in this book. How appropriate that Mead called it Succubus Revealed. Because, really, EVERYTHING comes together in the end.Which leads me to the second thing that Richelle Mead does extremely well - and that is plotting.It\u2019s amazing how she is able to match things up perfectly with all her events. You come to understand Jerome\u2019s don\u2019t-give-a-fuck attitude towards Georgie, you find out Carter\u2019s real purpose in Seattle, you learn why Seth\u2019s darling sister is sick. It all matches up and I love seeing an author who takes pride in making sure there is continuity in her work.For once, I can truly say that I figured this one out. I had my theories going into this book and I think Mead went the right way with this ending. Not only is the ending what every Georgina Kincaid fan wants for our Succubus girl, but it was very touching as well. I didn\u2019t expect to be so emotional over this book. Seth hasn\u2019t been my favourite person throughout this entire series, but you just know when two people are meant to be together and it\u2019s clear that Seth and Georgina are meant to be. This passage really proves this point:I tightened my arms around him and drew him toward the bed. \u201cI\u2019m still alive, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d he admitted, letting himself be drawn along. \u201cBut are you sure you don\u2019t want to just wait?\u201dHugh had said something after booking my flight. Everything changes when you\u2019re mortal. You don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring.\u201cI\u2019ve waited long enough,\u201d I told Seth, just before kissing him.And that was the moment I knew what it was like to have my soul back.But it isn\u2019t the love between Georgina and Seth that makes this book so good. It\u2019s also Roman\u2019s selfless act that blew my mind. After what he\u2019s done in the past, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect of him. But his actions in this book redeem him completely. I absolutely adore him and wished there was a way to read more about him. All in all, Succubus Revealed is the perfect ending to an amazing series. I\u2019m sure fans will be satisfied with Georgina\u2019s final book when they flip that last page.

They should fire you out of principle.\"\n\nUgh.This book just highlighted the reason why I try not to get too attached with a series. When it ends, it leaves a gaping hole in you that cannot be filled by anything else. Certainly not a spinoff series or an epilogue novella or dear gad no, an alternate POV. Because this exhilarating feeling, this high after going through a journey with much loved characters is a gift. A gift that every author should strive to give their readers, a once-in-a-story gift that cannot be re-filled and resurrected by revisiting these beloved characters in torturous permutations over and over to indulge people's vanities or for whatever excuse. Okay maybe a Carter spin-off won't be so bad.I've given up on the predictable nature of these books, midway through. Maybe I've even learned to love the near unassuming manner this story was told. You have to just take it as part of its charms together with the simplistic narrative to get to the depth of its emotional complexity and its implications. In that aspect it didn't disappoint. All the things I've guessed way, way back in book 2 turned out right and yet it still took my breath away.Everyone who knows my reading preference would know my short tolerance for cheese. But seeing as how much Seth and Georgina's characters had to go through to get here, that Notting Hill moment towards the end is perfectly forgivable. I'm also glad that this ended on the sixth book. Looking back, the series as a whole felt very solid, not airtight-locked in the logic department (Carter's definition of \"interfering\" is very hazy) but for a PNR-UF, six book series the structure was very good. You get the sense it was written with a clear end and path towards that end in sight. This may be debatable for someone who followed this series as the books were released but me, I found it very clean. Was it drawn out? Maybe. But I did enjoy the filler so I'm not one to complain.I've fawned so much about Seth and Georgina in the past reviews neglecting the amazing secondary characters in these books. I think I pretty much loved everyone, except the Vegas people in this book. Bastien was never a favorite and his scenes here certainly didn't improve my opinion of him. I love the scenes and banter between Georgina and her dysfunctional family but can't deny I look forward to seeing the Mortensen girls. Especially Kendall.

I still remember the excitement of reading Succubus Blues (Georgina Kincaid #1), the wit, the plot, everything was perfect. Succubus Revealed on the other hand, had none of its predecessor's charm and was slow to start. It didn't really pick up and when it came down to all the revelations, well there was no shock or suspense. I had literally predicted everything that would happen more or less due to the massive clue given to us in the previous book.My favourite part of it all though was Carter, I adore that guy and I am currently sending a psychic link to Richelle Mead with the message \"write a Carter story, come on!!

The End. Succubus Revealed is the last book in Richelle Mead's Georgina Kincaid series and I cannot begin to tell you how bittersweet reading this book felt. I wanted to hurry up and read it, yet slow down and savor the story. Ultimately I settled on \"screw it, full speed ahead!\" and read it in one seating.We find Georgina working as a Santa's elf at a high-end Mall, far away from her former ideal job at her beloved bookstore, which she had to leave after what happened with Seth and Maddie. Ugh Maddie. Blech, do. not. like! But that's another rant for another time. Georgie's been ordered by Hell to transfer her succubus services to Las Vegas, but when she goes out there to scope out the scene, things seem a little too intentionally perfect. With Seth Mortenson's sister-in-law still ill with cancer in Seattle, this transfer is yet one more hurdle in their attempt to be with each other. Sweet cheesus will Georgie and Seth ever be able to be together?! You'll have your answer by the end of Succubus Revealed and I get sentimentally teary-eyed all over again just remembering it.I did find some parts somewhat predictable, which made the beginning a little slow for me. The first half of the book was slow-moving, but by the middle, things start Happening with a capital H. Some readers probably have figured out several revelations that are hinted at in the last book, Succubus Shadows, but it is the raw emotions Ms. Mead is able to evoke that make this book so fantastic. I think Seth and Roman fans alike will be pleased with the outcome and with how things play out. The plot twists involving Jerome, Carter, and Roman separately are quite powerful. While I would have liked to have seen a few more things addressed, maybe a little more things flipped upside down in true Richelle Mead fashion, I was pleased with the way this ultimate love conquers all series was drawn to an end. The Georgina series will continue to be one of my favorites and I highly recommend it. They are very very sexy, highly emotional books, and I am glad Ms. Mead had this end in mind for Succubus Revealed.

Be warned particularly if you loved the book.This is the lowest I've given to any of the books in this series. I gave four to Succubus Shadows, so it should be obvious that I'm usually a fan of this series. As part of a literature course I've taken at university, we learned authors don't put anything unnecessary in their short stories. Everything in it has a role and meaning because the word count is limited. It's likely we don't extend this principle to longer books, but to me Succubus Revealed was full of parts I did not understand the purpose of. I know this is not a short story (maybe it should've been), but the first half of the book is full of random stuff which didn't even have entertainment value (what's up with the bowling?). It reads almost as if the author had written it in one sitting while making sure it had enough info to finish the book with a reasonable conclusion. Anyway it's a total garbage. The scariest thing was I did not care whatever happened to Georgina and Seth. I was thinking, \"Just get on with it, and tell me what happens in the end.\" See? That's not entertainment. The cheesy lines between Georgina and Seth were annoying, and their relationship felt superficial, if not fake. I got no real emotions from either of them because their feelings are so simple and you can describe every single emotion they had with one adjective. There was no depth to the characters. I also don't remember Georgina being so annoying. Has she been always so overdramatic and slow? Because she's so slow and clouded in her head, she doesn't do any work herself either. I don't want to reveal anything, but the only saving grace came from Kayla and Carter. I can't say much without giving hints at what happens, so let me just say they didn't feel fake. I could sense them as real (human or otherwise) beings with a less simplistic thinking process than any other main character. I think Georgina should've made time (or more like the author should've made her go) to talk to Kayla at the end of the story because I'm interested to hear what Kayla has to say. If that had happened, I would've given it three stars.Well, as far as the story goes, it picks up halfway through, and it has an ending, with questions answered. However, it was painful to read and care, and I would've been happy to get the summary of this book in bullet points.

They've had their ups and downs and everything seems to have worked itself out.Then, out of nowhere, she gets a message from hell - she's being transferred in a month from Seattle to Las Vegas. She's devastated, until she realizes she can bring Seth. But his sister-in-law is sick with cancer, and it's suddenly gotten worse; Seth must stay to help his brother and sister-in-law with their five young daughters. Georgina takes a weekend trip to Las Vegas to check in and make preparations for her arrival, and it's too good to be true: her boss is and old favorite, her new roommate is a very good friend, and he introduces her to another succubus who is a lot of fun and helps her land her dream job as a showgirl.Later, as she's telling her roommate, Roman, about all these things, he's deeply suspicious. Roman wants to know why hell wants her out of Seattle so quickly. As more and more secrets are uncovered, Georgina's future looks uncertain - for good or bad, no one knows.My thoughts:A fabulous ending to a fantastic series. I couldn't have asked for more. I had so many questions at the end of Succubus Shadows, and they were all answered in Succubus Revealed. Georgina's crew is like hell's version of Friends: \"No trouble at all. I get a discount at the mall.\" Jerome sighed and set down his fork. \"Are you still doing that Georgie? Don't I suffer enough without having to endure the humiliation ofa succubus who moonlights as a Christmas elf?\" \"You always said I should quit the bookstore and find something else to do,\" I reminded him. \"Yes, but that was because I thought you'd go on to do something respectable. Like become a stripper or the mayor's mistress.\" ~page 9, Succubus RevealedMs. Mead writes the quirkiest demons I've ever read. I mean, really, where else are you going to read about a bowling competition to prove demonic superiority?Seth was on my shit list for part of the series, but I'm firmly back in the Team Seth category. He's good for Georgina; he loves her more than anyone knew. Well, almost anyone...Roman was another character I had doubts about earlier in the series, but I must say that Roman was amazing. Everyone needs a friend like Roman; someone who's there for you despite the situation or the risks, someone who will fight for you and do everything in his power to ensure your happiness.And Carter, oh Carter. I think this is the only series where I like a secondary character more than the actual hero. Carter is an amazingly wonderful and complex character - his non-answers frustrated me throughout the series but really, why should that change in the last book, lol. (The last thing Carer says to Georgina on the very last page of the book brought tears to my eyes.)Throughout the entire series I've wanted a HEA for Georgina but I could not figure out for the life of me how she was going to get it. In her Succubus series, Ms. Mead has done a wonderful job weaving clues through multiple books, ending with a scene that left me holding my breath and closing one eye because I was afraid to look but had to keep reading. The epilogue left me extremely satisfied, although I may have needed a tissue or two.I can't really say whether or not you would enjoy this book if you haven't read the rest of the series - but I wouldn't advise it. This is book 6, and as such there is so much history between Georgina, Seth, and her demonic counterparts that you really should read the whole series.Oh, just one more thing: Hey Ms. Mead - how about a spinoff series or short story featuring Seth's little niece, Kayla, when she gets a bit older?"}, {"userName": "~Tina~", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2594672-tina", "userReview": "(4.5 stars)This series as been such a complete rush for me. I've never been one for Urban Fantasy reads, I dunno why really, it's just not my thing, but there are some exceptions. The Succubus books is definitely one of them and it's sad to see this finally come to an end, but I'm content with what happens to my favorite Succubus, Georgina Kincaid. Mead did a fantastic job with this book, with the entire series and I'm willing to let them go with a happy sigh....But, there was one thing that upset me and for those of you who've read this book know exactly who I'm talking about. I have faith that it's not the exact end for him though, but it was bittersweet none the less.I don't have much else to say about this book. I simply loved it. Period. It has an amazing cast, a plot that never stops and in the oddest way possible it was the perfect soul-mate story. Proving time and time again the power of true love.
