Well, it didn't disappoint  Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and then later, the involvement of the Union Army in the settling of the West, this historical fiction is absolutely  spellbinding.  The action in this story begins right away as Cathy is taken from her plantation by Philip Sheridan of the Union Army and recruited to work as a cook's assistant. Vowing to one day be reunited with her mother and younger sister, Cathy is outspoken, hard working, and the perfect historical fiction protagonist. She also finds herself constantly being mistaken as a man(due to her rather masculine features) and after the war is over, this does serve as a vehicle for Cathy to disguise herself and head out west with the Calvary. I think what really worked for me and  sustained my interest throughout  was how skeptical I felt when reading the synopsis of the story. Well, Sarah Bird certainly convinced me by providing many instances where \"discovery\" resulted in so many twists of fate. Add to the mix a really great cast of characters, some humour, romance, and a vivid portrait of 19th century America and it was truly a memorable story. One which will certainly have historical fiction fans intrigued.  Thanks to NetGalley for an advanced ebook in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Sharon Huether", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3534528-sharon-huether", "userReview": "An amazing story of a womans courage, determination and fortitude.

After the war is over she enlists in the Union Army disguised as a man with the Buffalo Soldiers.I\u2019ve always wondered how the Union Army was able to recruit/convince ex-slaves-right after the civil war- to become Buffalo Soldiers knowing what they were going to do to the Indians. It really has always baffled me. This story goes into that a little of that and explores the feelings of the Buffalo soldier\u2019s feelings on this. The Union Army was not kind to the soldiers and I believe used them horribly.As I was reading this story, I was dreading reading about what was going to happen once they get out west-already knowing its history and the author gives you a vivid picture of their struggles and Cathy\u2019s efforts to keep her disguise as a man.Daughter of a Daughter of a Queen is a top-notch historical fiction story, memorable characters, outstanding history details of its setting, conflict and I\u2019m truly looking forward to more stories by this author.I obtained a copy of this book from the publishers through NetGalley for an honest review.I have rated this book five stars.Stephanie M.

She began her life as a slave, but was endowed with a proud knowledge of her African ancestors. She experienced the Civil War as a Union Army cook. After the war she hid her gender and became a member of the Buffalo Soldiers, an all black regiment who worked in the West. That story in itself is fascinating, but the details are riveting; I\u2019ll not spoil them for you. There was much enlightening information: the challenges of blacks after they were freed; the treatment of the American Indians; life in the West; behavior toward women. I learned so much from this book. This is a powerful and important book, full of engrossing historical information and impossible to put down!

This is the sort of books that they should read in schools as recommended reading. Human, emotive, touching and very raw. I could see this being a movie very easily because it's that good (in the way that a movie would ruin it likely). From a white, foreign, perspective the American Civil War and the continuing racial tensions have always been so difficult to understand because I grew up in a country where slavery was made illegal hundreds of years ago in a multicultural school where racism was never even considered or seen. I realize that's a privileged thing to say, but this book just illustrated so much of the historical pain behind the current problems that it seems so relevant. I especially liked the beginning where she illustrates that the stereotype of the southern black ex-slave is so strong to make people assume she's a fake and the part where she comforts the dying black soldier. You can see the transition from a certain naivete into a much harder woman just between those two points. A very dynamic read with developed characters. Great history."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/712719-heather", "userReview": "Oh my, this book is engaging and wonderful. So true to what happened to the slaves after the civil war ended. The North did not truly care what happened to the slaves. Most of them did not care one bit for the Africans any more then the Southerns did. The Northerns were just following orders and refuse to let the South leave the Union. Once the civil war was over there was nothing for the slaves. They were just kicked off the only home they had ever known and made to fend for themselves.I don't judge Cathy's choices cause in all honestly if I was in the same situation I would probably do the same thing. I admire her for surviving the way she did.The characters are all well written and the story line is amazing. You need to read this book. The strength of Cathy is amazing the only downside to the book is the very end. It does not end they way you think it should or would.

It tells the tale of Cathy Williams, who was the only woman documented to have served in the U.S. Army with the Buffalo Soldiers. She hid her identity and served two years before she was found out. She was a real person and she really did this, but the novel is fiction based on her story. Still, it\u2019s a wonderfully fascinating tale of a very courageous and bold woman. Her grandmother was a queen in Africa, but she was kidnapped and ended up in slavery in the southern U.S. Her daughter and granddaughter (Cathy) were born into slavery. The story begins during the Civil War, when General Philip Sheridan selects Cathy to come along with his entourage and be his cook\u2019s helper. She is forced to leave all that\u2019s left of her family, her mother and little sister. She sees the war end and her people freed, but then they have to find something to do. She was a cook\u2019s helper, so she has skills, but she doesn\u2019t want to be a laundress or a cook, two of the very few jobs that were available to women at the time. She and her friend, Solomon, who was the cook she worked for and who now wants to marry her, decide to go into the Army. Without giving away any spoilers, Cathy ends up enlisting in the Army alone. She is sent west, supposedly to fight Indians. But, the cowardly commander of her post has other ideas for the soldiers. The story has a lot of very tense moments. She\u2019s a woman living in a very dangerous situation. She\u2019s alone and has few friends and can really trust no one. The work is very hard and the conditions are really bad. Weather is hot and there is no shelter at the fort at first, since it was burned down. She constantly has to struggle to keep her identity hidden. To complicate things, some of the other soldiers bully her all the time. But she has great marksmanship skills and gains their respect eventually, but it doesn\u2019t completely stop the bullying and harassment she has to endure for being \u201cdifferent.\u201d Even though the men don\u2019t know she\u2019s a woman, they sense that she is different somehow. Her situation is further complicated because she met the man who is now her Sergeant previously, when she was on the wagon being transported to General Sheridan\u2019s camp. He does not recognize her though. The tale is very complex and intricately woven. I was so absorbed in her story that I didn\u2019t want it to end. I even went on Google to see if there is more information out there about her life. She\u2019s a fascinating historical figure and one that I have never heard about before. It\u2019s sad that our history books don\u2019t tell the stories of people like Cathy Williams. She deserves a place in history. This book should be made into a movie so that her story can be shared more widely. The book was very well-written and I enjoyed the author\u2019s take on the story. We don\u2019t know all that much about Cathy Williams, but this book gives her interesting life a new audience and hopefully will lead to more research so we can learn more about her. I think this book would be appropriate for history classes since it presents a first-person look at the Civil War, the Buffalo Soldiers, and life on the frontier. It also shows how poorly the black people were treated by just about everyone they encountered in those days. They may have gained freedom, but they were still in a bad situation. The sort of insider\u2019s view that a reader gets in a book like this is invaluable for teaching these lessons. High school students should read this book because it will help them gain a new perspective that they can\u2019t get out of a dry, boring textbook. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34641535-vicki", "userReview": "This compelling,well-told tale tracks the life and struggles of the only know female Buffalo Soldier. Author Sarah Bird vividly, sometimes painfully, captures the inhumanity, racism, sexism and danger Black Americans faced during and after the Civil War, especially the precarious fates awaiting Black women.Told in first person narrative, Bird imagines the life of former slave Cathay Williams, a girl who is torn from her family to be a cook's helper for the Union Army during the Civil War. When the war ends, she faces bleak prospects as a Black woman and decides to flip her name to William Cathay to enlist in the U.S. Army as male Buffalo Soldier after the war. This is an often violent, sometimes heartbreaking story right to the end.As with all historical fiction, readers need to remember that this is, indeed, fiction. The author places Williams in the 9th Cavalry while the real William Cathay enlisted in the infantry. Other details are altered for the sake of the story. But what a story it is.

She makes the decision to join the Union Army disguised as a male, to become a Buffalo soldier as a means of survival, having witnessed what can happen to African American women. The narrative is enriched by the language, knowledge of army life (for African Americans in 1860's) and the social-political realities of the era; all well told by the author. The excellent writing swept me away into this hard world by the writer's vivid descriptions and the development of the relationships between Cathy and her mentor, her sister, and the lengths she went to disguise herself while in the Army. When she falls in love with a man the reader feels her heartache and the stakes that are in play for both characters. This isn't an 'easy' read but it's an important subject to know about and the author makes the experience compelling and satisfying. I can envision this book becoming a movie and if it is I hope actors can show the story, as well as the author, wrote.

Her story is one of horrible cruelty and the danger of being discovered, raped, and killed a constant. I enjoyed the book the most when she was a cook and on campaign in the Civil War because there was a lot going on and it was exciting. I think I expected more about the Buffalo Soldiers since they were in most of the military campaigns and 23 Buffalo Soldiers received the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars. Her time was mostly building barracks, cleaning latrines, cooking, and trying to figure out how to use the bathroom and bathe without being discovered.

Historical fiction, I have a love-hate thing for. There are stories that wouldn't be told without the fiction aspect because there just isn't enough concrete evidence to write a bit of non-fiction for. It varies too about just how much of the fiction is true. Given how little is actually known about this Private Williams, much of this has to be fiction. I dislike when that is the case because I want it to be real. I want to be able to talk about it as if it was all true and I can't.Where does that leave me? It leaves me reading a book that is inspired by a woman with a history that hasn't been well documented. Those whose interest has been raised can certainly try to look for more, but for those who want a feel of how it might have gone, have this story.The story is engaging and I found myself thinking about it even when I wasn't reading it (like when I was trying to finish a library book that was due). Overall, I felt the writing was strong.Potential spoiler ahead...The love story. I happen to believe that for her to have lasted as long as she did without being discovered, there probably was someone who helped protect her and it probably would've been a romantic hook-up.

I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on it.it but I could feel there was something wrong. I gradually came to realize that the problem lay in how the people of color were portrayed in the book. Not only were the voices problematic but they were written in cliche.You know what this reminded me of? Gone with the Wind. That is NOT a good thing. African-Americans were consistently shown to be mulish, ignorant and backwards. The lead character was supposed to draw strength from her heritage. Her mother stressed her being the child of a strong warrior woman from Africa, but the actual connection to her heritage was written in such a way as to be purely tenuous and superficial.One scene in particular was absolutely ridiculous. Cathy, as an enlisted Buffalo Soldier, has to hide her gender but her fellow soldiers are suspicious. As a trial she is forcefully put into a room with a prostitute, while her fellow soldiers listen at the door. What followed was a ridiculous farce. Cathy banged on the bed while encouraging an unfortunate, intoxicated sex-worker to pray loudly to \u201cHell Mary\u201d for forgiveness for her sins. The ensuing noise convinced the soldiers that Cathy MUST be a man and hella good at sex besides. This was scene belonged in a Mel Brook\u2019s comedy. It was demeaning, ludicrous and repellant.I won\u2019t even go into her depiction of First Nations people. They were props. Like the stand-in, life size cardboard figures you see in a movie theater.This is not historical fiction. It\u2019s just fiction. Loosely attaching your character to a real person\u2019s history does not lend credence to your story. I found the entire book odious. I\u2019m sorry I read it.
