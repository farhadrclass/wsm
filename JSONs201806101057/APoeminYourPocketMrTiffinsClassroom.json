Unfortunately though, poetry and perfection really don\u2019t work together no matter whether you are talking haikus, concrete poems or rhyming stanzas. A poet is going to be visiting their school and Elinor desperately wants to impress her with her poetry. But as the time goes by, the pressure builds and Elinor becomes less and less able to write poetry. When she finally does start writing, she\u2019s not happy with any of the poems she has written. Can the kind teacher Mr. Tiffin find a way to let Elinor know that it\u2019s OK to make mistakes? Maybe this is a job for a poet!This is a wonderful addition to an already strong series. McNamara \u201cperfectly\u201d captures the trap of perfectionism for students and the pressure that it builds in a person. Tying it to poetry was inspired, something that doesn\u2019t work with tension or pressure but instead relies on inspiration and creativity. Elementary students will see themselves in both Elinor and her classmates who are more relaxed about the entire thing. Watch for the poem that ties to How Many Seeds in a Pumpkin? for fans of the series. Karas\u2019 illustrations continue in his signature style that is playful and friendly. His drawings add to the accessibility of the entire book and the series as a whole. A winning addition to a popular series, this third book will delight during poetry units and may inspire a more relaxed approach to writing too.

Elinor is a student in Mr. Tiffin's class who is intent on writing the best poem ever! The night before \"Poem in Your Pocket\" day at her school where a real poet is going to be visiting, Elinor becomes so obsessed with writing the PERFECT poem that she doesn't even have one prepared to share with the rest of the school. The the poet asks her to share her poem, she beautifully shares the poem from her mind that she had not rehearsed just simply felt. Ways for Classroom Use:This piece of literature would be a wonderful read aloud for a k-3 class learning about poems. Different types of poetry- haikus, metaphors, and similes- are all mentioned with examples from students in the text. While the students are learning about the need for creativity and raw emotion when writing a poem, they are also informed of different forms of poetry. I think that it would also be fun to incorporate a \"Poem in Your Pocket\" day in my future classroom as well! This text has a great message as well.Why This is a WOW Book:A Poem in Your Pocket (Mr. Tiffin's Classroom Series) is a WOW book for me because of the beautiful and honest message that it sends. Poetry is a raw form of literature. Poetry is honest, sometimes happy and sometimes sad, but always honest. I loved watching the progression of Elinor's struggles and final triumph as she spoke a beautiful, thoughtful poem that can directly from her mind in front of the entire school.

She loves school and takes her assignments very seriously.Brief Book Summary: Students are having someone who writes poems come talk to them. They are talking about the poet while they are making rhymes. To prepare for the poet, the children are learning about literary elements to use in their poetry. At the end, the students share their poetry and new poetry skills that they have learned. Professional Recommendation/Review #1: Children's Literature - Carol WolfenbargerIn this story, a poet visited a school to share her love of poetry with the students, and her visit inspired \u201cPoem in Your Pocket Day.\u201d An over-achiever, Elinor, announces that she will wear jeans with six pockets on the day of the poet\u2019s visit and that she will have an original poem is each of the pockets, making six original poems in all. Elinor and her classmates will have the month before the visit to read poetry and find inspiration to write their own poems. Readers will see that Elinor puts herself under pressure to write the best poem, but she cannot seem to write the perfect poem. On the day of the poet\u2019s visit Elinor has to admit that she has no poem in the one pocket of the dress she\u2019s decided to wear. Emmy Crane, the fictional poet, recognizes Elinor\u2019s embarrassment. With gentle encouragement, Emmy helps Elinor assemble her ideas into a poem. The book concludes with Margaret McNamara\u2019s suggestions when trying to put one\u2019s own thoughts into a poem. Poem in Your Pocket will be a useful in classrooms to inspire students to write poetry. Reviewer: Carol Wolfenbarger; Ages 5 to 8.Professional Recommendation/Review #2: School Library Journal 12/01/2014Gr 1\u20133\u2014Elinor is a perfectionist. She loves school and takes her assignments very seriously. For Poetry Month, Mr. Tiffin teaches his class about different kinds of poetry, similes, and metaphors. Anticipating an upcoming author visit by a real poet, students are asked to write a poem and put it in their pocket. Elinor plans to wear her jeans with many pockets so she can have one in every pocket, but her obsession with perfection impedes her creativity. On the day of the visit, the child has not created anything that she considers good enough to share. When the guest asks her to read her poem, Elinor reveals that she \"has a poem in the pocket of her mind.\" When she recites it, her words flow beautifully. This is a great book to share during National Poetry Month. Brief explanations are given for the more common poetry forms and the idea of a \"Poem in Your Pocket Day\" is inspiring. Pair this book with the works of Shel Silverstein, Paul B. Janeczko, Jack Prelutsky, Douglas Florian, or Robert Louis Stevenson, among others, to make a persuasive unit on the delights of the genre. Colorful illustrations of a busy classroom filled with enthusiastic students and a determined child keep the subject light and humorous. This title shines a light on a subject worthy of discussion.\u2014Mary Hazelton, formerly at Warren & Waldoboro Elementary Schools, MEResponse to Two Professional Reviews: Both reviews state how this book will encourage and influence children to write poetry and be fond of poetry. This book is inspiring to young poets and will allow students to be enthusiastic about writing poetry. This book will motivate students. Evaluation of Literary Elements: There are similes and rhymes. For example, \u201cmath is like a knot\u201d. They are also introducing metaphors. Consideration of Instructional Application: After reading the story to children have them independently write down their initial thoughts on poetry. Do you think poems seem hard and scary? Do you think poetry seems fun? Have you ever read a poem? Have you ever written a poem?"}, {"userName": "Alex (not a dude) Baugh", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4449236-alex-not-a-dude-baugh", "userReview": "April is National Poetry Month and what better way to start the month than with a picture book about poetry. And Margaret McNamara's third book about Mr. Tiffin and his students is definitely up to the task.All through April, Mr. Tiffin's class is going to learn all about poems in preparation for poem in you pocket day and a author visit from a well known poet, Emmy Crane. But Elinor has spent all of March at the library studying poetry. so now she has all the answers when it comes things like similes, metaphors concrete poems, haiku, acoustic poems.But when Mr. Tiffin takes the class out for a walk to practice using their poet's eyes, the kids in Elinor's class all seem to be able to see the poetry around them except Elinor. And when brings brown bags with surprises in them for everyone and asks each student to write a poem about what's in their bag, Elinor just can't seem to get one written. Her poetry journal is blank.Over the weekend, Elinor writes poem after poem, but none are good enough as far as she is concerned. Finally, on Poem in Your Pocket Day, Elinor goes to school with an empty pocket. In assembly, Emmy Crane reads some to her own poetry to the children, and each child reads their poem to her. But when its Elinor's turn, she courageously goes up on the stage and confesses to Emmy that she has no poem, none were perfect enough for a poet like her. No poem is perfect, Emmy tells her, but can she help Elinor find her poet's eye?A Poem in Your Pocket is an ideal book for introducing young readers and writers about poetry, a subject that is so often overlooked in schools these days. It is a wonderful read aloud as well as a great teaching tool. McNamars's definitions of the different poetic terms used are simply defined making that aptly suited for young children just starting their poetic life. I loved the walk Mr. Tiffin took the kids on to discover the poetry in the things that they see everyday but probably don't think much about. Added to this wonderful book are Karas's gouache, acrylic and pencil sometimes full page, sometimes spot illustrations, adding to and enhancing the story. He really captures Elinor's frustration and despair, along with the eagerness with which the other kids in the class embraced poetry. I really liked that Mr. Tiffin's class was portrayed as very diverse. I thought this was going to be a story about a girl who just wasn't terribly poetic. Instead it was about how we all have a poet's eye and that there is no such thing as a perfect poem. Of course, the underlying message is about how the need to be or do something perfectly results in being completely unproductive because nothing measures up. And bravo for the portrayal of a caring teacher and poet who both gently showed Elinor what's important.A Poem in Your Pocket is a book not to be missed.This book is recommended for readers age 5+This book was borrowed from a friendRemember - Poem in Your Pocket Day is Thursday, April 30, 2015This review was originally posted on Randomly Reading"}, {"userName": "Margie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5281649-margie", "userReview": "When you reach into your pocket forgotten treasures may be discovered.
