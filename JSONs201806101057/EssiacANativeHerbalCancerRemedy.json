I love that she honoured her teachers by never seling the medicine and using it only to help those needing it. Also she never sold the remedy to pharmaceutical companies either. Read it - you'll love it too."}, {"userName": "P.J.

How does it work? Does it work? Is it effective? The author admits that it does not work in all cases. She calls it a \u201cremedy\u201d rather than a cure. This is herbal medicine and some of its herbs are toxic. Burdock root, for example, is \u201canti-bacterial and anti-fungal,\u201d which means it is toxic to living things. Of course, one could argue that all medicines are toxic. It is \u201can excellent immune system strengthener,\u201d which probably means it provokes or irritates the immune system to act. It mimics estrogen, which might be dangerous. On page 96 it says that Essiac tea \u201cenhances Natural Killer Cell activities.\u201d Again, this could be in reaction to the toxicity of the tea itself. Some of the testimonials come from Resperin Corporation, which has a vested interest to protect.On pages 95 and 96 the book attempts to explain how the therapy works, but it is speculative. The herbs are said to contain compounds, complex sugars, glycosides, herbal alkaloids, etc., that have anti-tumor properties. I\u2019ll have to leave it at that. The book goes beyond mere herbal therapy into body, mind, and spirit connections. Exercise, diet, visualization, meditation, stress reduction are all discussed. I like its emphasis on stress reduction. Dr. Jim Chan, one of the three authors, concludes about cancer that \u201cmanagement of stress and a healthy life style is the best cure.\u201d The directions for brewing this tea are confusing because they involve ounces, tablespoons, gallons, and cups. Plus \u201cliquid ounces\u201d and \u201cscale weight ounces\u201d and \u201cmeasuring cup ounces.\u201d It is hard to work with so many different units of measurement. Essiac tea therapy is very complicated biochemistry. This book is good as far as it goes, but leaves many questions unanswered."}, {"userName": "avery", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26823650-avery", "userReview": "Amazing Read!Very easy read!
