The plane Andee is piloting crashes somewhere in Alaska, and to make matters worst, there is a possible terrorist among the survivors. The story of them fighting for survival was intriguing and then the side plot with Andee's father added to the adventure.The reason for 3.5 stars is due to the romance side. Andee and Mac met for the first time at the airport and when the plane went down, there was some strive between them, mainly due to Mac's mistrust about everyone's innocence and paranoia about the terrorist. Then within 3 days they fall in love and love each other and and...not a fan of insta-love.Also, for some reason I missed Sarah's story and how she and Hank became a couple. Book 2 she still was wary about him, book 3 which was mentioned to be a few weeks after the wedding in the end of book 2, they were a couple. Also would have liked a story about Connor.The revelation of who the terrorist is was a bit surprising. There was a few suspects and Mac's paranoia about each survivor added to me not 100% knowing who the culprit was.All in all enjoyed the series, however it was more of an adventure series than suspense."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416312-ruth", "userReview": "Expect the Sunrise is the third book in Susan May Warren's romantic suspense Team Hope series, released by Tyndale. With this novel, SMW has crafted a superb suspense story that grabs your attention from the first page and refuses to let go. Mac is an FBI agent, consumed with guilt over his brother's death in a terrorist chase gone wrong and anger at the pilot that refused to land to help them. Unbeknownst to Mac, Andee (aka \"Emma\") is the pilot that was forced to make that difficult call. She is drowning in the guilt of past choices that have negatively defined her life and self-image. Mac and Andee meet at a crossroads in their lives. They each face a choice: to continue to let the turmoil cause by past decisions to dictate their futures, or to relinquish control of their lives and their pasts and strive to face each new day in the light of God's grace. In addition to spinning a powerful story of characters finding peace and coming to terms with their pasts, Warren's tale is also very timely. Mac's brother is killed by a terrorist attempting to blow up the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and disrupt the US supply of oil. It seems like a day doesn't go by that some question of oil prices and supply issues aren't being discussed in the news. Warren brings readers face-to-face with the threat of a TAPS disruption and its ramifications on the US oil supply, and drives home the sacrifices made by real individuals who put their lives on the line every day since they answered the call to protect their country. I have to say that SMW gets better and better with every novel. She has more than given Dee Henderson a run for the title of \"Queen of Romantic Suspense\" in the Christian fiction genre -- in many ways I believe SMW streaks past Dee in simply the quality of her writing. Susan writes absolutely beautiful romances, enthralling suspense stories, and weaves them together with just the right touch of faith and grace. She is an author to watch and trust me, once you read one of her books you'll be addicted for life!"}, {"userName": "Phylisha Stone", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32456286-phylisha-stone", "userReview": "A good Christian romantic suspense book with a plane crash in the middle of nowhere Alaska, a terrorist plot, FBI and other undercover agents. This is actually the third book in the Team Hope series, so I will be going back to read books one and two based on how good this was."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "I have read other books by this author and I really liked them. This however was a disappointment. I am being generous with the three stars. It is a sweet story which is the only thing it has going for it.I was so excited to read this because it was set in Alaska and that is where I was born and raised. She did her homework and got the Alaskan lingo right but she tried to use it all in the fist few pages. And the reader in the audio version should have done her homework and learned how to pronounce the names. That was bothersome.A lot of the conversation could have all happened in a cafe somewhere instead of being stranded in the Alaskan wilderness after a plane crash. There was no detail about Alaska or the weather or the challenges or anything. It was like the crash never happened since there was no depth in the details through out the story. In the beginning, in trying to figure out which one on the plane is the terrorist...ugghhhh....that was painful. Immediately you know it is the one that they say that it isn't. And when he thought it was the pilot...that was just insane. There was no thought process there. And it didn't fool anyone. Sure the one who dedicates her life to saving and serving others, yeah she is the one...I mean really. I get she was trying to create contention for the \"love pair\" but it was just so obvious. And then they are making out after she escapes from the terrorists by jumping into freezing waters ...really ... who does that? Wouldn't Mr. FBI agent want to know who she was running from, what was going on or even ask if she was alright...but no...they have to kiss and then kiss some more. Never mind there are people with guns around. UGHHHHH.I will stop here. I could go on and on about this. This could have been so much better. Overall...she ditched the story as a whole for the sake of the romance. It is always nice when both elements are present and accounted for."}, {"userName": "Tamara Tilley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1383724-tamara-tilley", "userReview": "EXPECT THE SUNRISE is the third book in the TEAM HOPE series by Susan May Warren. Each book follows the lives of search and rescue members that make up Team Hope. EXPECT THE SUNRISE takes place in the Alaskan wilderness after the plane piloted by Andee MacLoad, a mountain rescuer, crash lands during a storm. Sterling \u201cMac\u201d MacLeod, an FBI agent, is one of seven survivors and immediately suspects there is a saboteur on the flight, with the Alaskan Pipeline as its target. Andee and Mac clash when decisions have to be made regarding the safety of the passengers. With Andee\u2019s best friend injured, she decides to hike out on her own in search of help. Mac fears she is the saboteur and insists they stay together, not wanting her to get the opportunity to accomplish her plan for disaster. What results is an intriguing story as Andee and Mac struggle with trust, survival, and secrets that could shatter their growing interest in each other.I thoroughly enjoyed the TEAM HOPE series. With adventurous stories set in the great outdoors, Susan May Warren captivates her audience with deep characters, rich plots, and enough suspense to keep you guessing."}, {"userName": "JoAnn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21369961-joann", "userReview": "I've read all 3 books in the Team Hope series, and I have truly enjoyed each one. I think the story lines were very well thought out and written, and they kept me wanting to read to find out what happens.I gave it 3 stars because the one thing I had a very hard time with is that most of the book is a reflection instead of what is happening at the moment in the book. Something is happening in the present day, and then the character starts thinking about something that happened years ago, and the next few pages seem to be a reflection of what happened years ago, instead of what is happening in the present. I'm sure people like that style of writing, but it's not a favorite of mine. I'm constantly thinking, 'Fine that's what happened before, but what is happening now?' and I get frustrated when the reflection takes a lot of pages. I would rather stick with the present day and what is happening in the plot of the story.But other than that, it's a great book and a good series."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58099820-nicole", "userReview": "I read this book years ago in my late teens and decided to re-read it because I had forgotten much of it. Back then I only read suspence books. Now 10 years later I have branched off to several different genres. In recent years I have come to apreciate Watren's writting style. Her characters are flawed, but you root for them to find their way. I am glad I came back to this book and read the story again with a more mature outlook. This book reminded me that when we think the world is falling apart, we must remember that God sees the big picture. We don't understand why we have to endure heartache, but we can text knowing that even in the darkest night, when we are a child of God, we can expect the sunrise."}, {"userName": "Rachelle Sperling", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10712883-rachelle-sperling", "userReview": "I had a hard time with the first book in the series because I couldn't connect with the characters. Maybe it was the one being a spy, I couldn't get a feel for who she was. Then I read the second book in the series and liked it better. I could connect better with Team Hope and enjoyed the plot. Then I read this one and it got even better. I loved the reality of struggling through hard things that happen and learning about how to trust God in the midst of it.
