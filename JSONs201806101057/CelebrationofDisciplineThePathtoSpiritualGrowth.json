In my private readings I'd immersed myself in wider and deeper worlds, searching, searching.In 1984 I was doing some training in Estes Park and went to hear Amy Grant at the YMCA of the Rockies. I wanted to hear her do Angels Watching Over Me in person, and that done, I browsed the bookstore before heading back to my cabin.This book, recently published at the time, grabbed me so aggressively I nearly fell on the floor. It was the missing link I'd been searching for, the connection between Christian thought and spiritual practice. I stayed up all night reading it, and to this day consider it one of the most important books in my life. It set my life loose, on a journey of discovery that continues to this day.This is soul-rocking stuff, for those who are ready for it.Little did I realize at the time it would speak to others with the same power: Richard Foster's ideas have gone on to become a movement. My spirituality doesn't lend itself to industrial-strength support systems so I haven't done much to keep up with all he's doing. But from what I can tell the heart of his message has remained the same, and he has stayed true to the quiet voice that knocked me on the floor those many years ago.If you wonder how you can find the deeper layers of the teachings of the revolutionary Jesus, you could do worse than to spend some time with Foster."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5784721-bill", "userReview": "I have mixed feelings about Celebration of Discipline. On one hand, I struggled with Foster\u2019s subjective terminology and mystic approach. At times I found myself wondering exactly what he meant, and in turn wondering whether I would agree with him if I discovered exactly what he meant. Part of this is a difference theological emphasis, but I suspect it also comes down to a difference in personality. Some people like objective descriptions of neat and tidy concepts (like me), whereas others prefer more subjective, open ended, provocative discussion (like Richard Foster, perhaps). This was particularly evident when Foster turned to practical descriptions of spiritual Disciplines that went beyond what is clear from Scripture. I've come to prefer the term \u201cmeans of grace\u201d to refer to these kinds of practices, which keeps the focus on God\u2019s part, rather than Spiritual Disciplines, which puts the focus on my part. For these reasons, I can\u2019t whole-heartedly get on board with Foster\u2019s vision of the Christian life.Nonetheless, I am drawn to his very experiential way of following Jesus. I long for deeper meditation on Scripture, deeper times of prayer. I loved the chapter on study. I do appreciate silence as a way of connecting with God; I do seek to live a simple life. I would like to be more open to communal expressions of faith; I would like to express more unaffected joy. And so I was encouraged and motivated by this book. I won\u2019t be adopting the life of an evangelical mystic anytime soon, but there\u2019s plenty I can learn from Richard Foster."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1839360-laura", "userReview": "Everybody thinks of changing humanity and nobody thinks of changing himself.Leo TolstoyI first read this book in 1996 and loved it. I re-read it in 2005 and got even more out of it the second time. The book is inspiring and is a good reminder of the way I can have a more Christ-centered life through discipline.Foster deals first with the inward disciplines: meditation, prayer, fasting, study. Then, he moves on to the outward disciplines: simplicity, solitude, submission, and service. The corporate disciplines: confession, worship, guidance, and celebration (these last two didn't resonate with me as much, but were still worthwhile).What I love the most about the book is his reminder that the pursuit of a Christ-centered life is all about change and bringing ourselves closer to God. To pray is to change. To confess is to change. To worship is to change.The idea is that daily scripture study and prayer is not to check off a to-do list, but actually change my life and who I am. The disciplines themselves are worthless without change.I like the idea of incorporating meditation into my prayer time and allowing for more silence. I like the idea of emptying myself through meditation and then allowing myself to be filled with God's love. To let myself be open to God's will.The chapter on simplicity was very interesting and just what I needed to hear. (Foster has an entire book dedicated to the subject of simplicity that I recommend, Freedom of Simplicity - if you're interested in a book that doesn't have a Christian point of view I recommend Voluntary Simplicity by Duane Elgin). Foster does a good job of inspiring change and encouraging you to start where you are at now."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron", "userReview": "Classic twentieth-century guide to a deeper inner life and joy.

What better place to start than with Foster's classic. Certainly, a must read for any believer, but especially important for those of us who call ourselves \"leaders\" in the church. This book establishes the starting point for true leadership...learning to place ourselves in God's presence where he can begin to do the work of transformation in us. Foster's list of twelve disciplines, I've learned, is certainly not exhaustive, but they are an excellent place to start in the process of becoming firmly rooted in the Spirit's ability to transform us into the character of Christ."}, {"userName": "Johnny", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903066-johnny", "userReview": "Although influenced by Dallas Willard (prior to his publication of The Spirit of the Disciplines), Richard J. Foster uses a different taxonomy in Celebration of Discipline than Willard uses in his book (Disciplines of Abstinence (solitude, silence, fasting, frugality, chastity, secrecy, sacrifice) and Disciplines of Engagement (study, worship, celebration, service, prayer, fellowship, confession, submission) (p. 158)). Foster\u2019s division of spiritual disciplines is a trinity of Inward Individual (meditation, prayer, fasting, study), Outward Individual (simplicity, solitude, submission, service), and Corporate (confession, worship, guidance, celebration). Even a quick perusal of the lists should indicate that there are overlapping terms for maturing in discipleship.A lot of people from the Protestant tradition are immediately dissuaded from the idea of spiritual disciplines because they are so focused on the idea of grace. Grace, of course, is both the beginning and the sustaining of spiritual growth, but growth is growth toward something. Foster points out that the motivation toward establishing spiritual discipline is simply a \u201clonging for God\u201d (p. 2) and that, as with meditation, we learn to benefit from these disciplines by doing these disciplines (p. 26). The book quickly establishes that we cannot overcome sin and become closer to God by willpower alone (p. 5), but a means of receiving grace (p. 7).Fortunately, this is a very practical introduction to these disciplines that recognizes that one doesn\u2019t simply become an expert practitioner or spiritual giant overnight. Rather, Foster quotes the contemplative monk, Thomas Merton, as stating that we are all \u201cbeginners\u201d all of our lives (p. 2). Although my summary of this volume may seem somewhat superficial, Celebration of Discipline: The Path to Spiritual Growth is the kind of book that requires several readings and plenty of contemplation in order to get the most out of it. In fact, I rarely use a study guide when I\u2019m digesting a devotional book, but I greatly benefited from the published study guide for this one.Here are some of the ideas which were useful for me. In discussing meditation, Foster notes that the purpose of Eastern meditation is detachment from the world while Christian meditation is not merely trying to empty the evil, but fill ourselves with the good (p. 21). The book urges using both our memory and our imagination to meditate upon Scripture until it literally becomes God\u2019s living word specifically to us (p. 29). As in his work on prayer, Foster quotes Martin Luther as stating that he is \u201cso busy\u201d that he must spend hours in prayer each day (p. 34). \u201cPrayer is like any other work; we may not feel like working, but once we have been at it for a bit, we begin to feel like working.\u201d (p. 45)\u201cFasting is feasting,\u201d says Foster (p. 55) to introduce the idea that fasting sets one free from the tyranny of desire. He cautions readers about jumping right into a long fast, suggesting several practical ideas for moving gradually into the experience. He also emphasizes four steps in study: 1) repetition (p. 64), 2) concentration (p. 65), 3) comprehension (p. 66), and 4) reflection (p. 66). I was impressed with his warning under study that, \u201cAll too many people rush to the application process and bypass the interpretation stage.\u201d (p. 69)Upon reaching the outward disciplines of the individual, Foster warns that the discipline of simplicity is not simply ascetism (p. 84). Three keys to simplicity are: 1) treat all as a gift from God, 2) ask all to be cared for by God, and 3) make all available to others (p. 88). Practical activities with regard to simplicity are: 1) buy for usefulness, not status (p. 90), 2) reject anything which has a tendency to become addictive in you (p. 90), 3) habitually give things away (p. 91), 4) be skeptical of advertising (p. 92), 5) enjoy things without owning them (p. 93), 6) get close to the earth (p. 93), 7) avoid instant gratification (p. 93), 8) use simple, honest speech (p. 93), 9) reject anything that requires oppression of others (p. 94), and 10) shun anything that doesn\u2019t help you put the Kingdom of God first (p. 95).Foster quotes an old proverb on silence: \u201cAll those who open their mouths, close their eyes!\u201d (p. 98). Silence is difficult, but silence indicates trust (p. 100). He also indicates that there is something of a paradox with regard to silence, \u201cIf we are silent when we should speak, we are not living in the Discipline of silence. If we speak when we should be silent, we again miss the mark.\u201d (p. 99)Perhaps the most surprising discussion is to find the Discipline of solitude listed among the Outward Individual disciplines. The essence of the idea is that we have to experience solitude in order to prepare ourselves to be with people. Thomas Merton is quoted with regard to solitude as indicating that it helps him love his brothers (p. 108). Again, Foster is very practical, offering insight on celebrating \u201clittle solitudes\u201d on pages 105-6.With submission, Foster is quite frank about bad teaching on submission which leads to self-hatred (p. 110). The purpose of the Discipline of submission is to liberate us from the tyranny of our own wills (pp. 111, 113) not to psychologically flagellate ourselves. On pages 122-3, he lists seven acts of submission: 1) to God, 2) to Scripture, 3) to family, 4) to neighbors and those around us, 5) to the believing community, 6) to the broken and despised, and 7) to the world. Noting that some people think submission means to put yourself and family at harmful risk, Foster cautions that, \u201cRevolutionary subordination commands us to live in submission to human authority until it becomes destructive.\u201d (p. 124)I particularly needed to see Foster\u2019s discussion of \u201ctrue service\u201d as not being about \u201cresults\u201d or being a means of manipulation (pp. 128-9). He urges hiddenness (p. 130) and for believers not to feel contempt for small things (p. 136). But perhaps the most revolutionary teaching for me in this volume was on the ministry of forgiveness. Foster cites Jesus command to forgive (John 20:23) and points out how we miss opportunity to assure and bless our brothers and sisters by not practicing the act of verbal, specific forgiveness (p. 148).I didn\u2019t really gain much from the discussion of worship, but liked the phrasing which suggested that worship forms are the \u201cwineskin\u201d or vessels for us to receive the presence of God (p. 159). I also liked the phrase about meeting God in the kitchen in order to meet God at church (p. 162). Perhaps, the most helpful ideas were that worship begins by stilling creaturely activity (p. 166) and continues as praise brings emotion into worship (p. 168).The discussion on corporate guidance (not the same as in corporate organization) was interesting in that Foster observed how decisions in the early church were regularly agreed upon by using other spiritual disciplines: prayer, worship, fasting, etc. (p. 177). He cited a practice called \u201csounding the call\u201d in which one church has a regular time at the end of a service in which people share what they believe God wants them to do and members of the church volunteer to come up and pray, share, counsel them (p. 181). The last discussion was on celebration. His conclusion was that joy is the end result of building the disciplines (p. 193). Celebration, then, frees us of an inflated view of our self-importance and of our tendency toward a judgmental spirit (pp. 196-7). I don\u2019t know what I was expecting when I ordered this book, but it probably wasn\u2019t this. Celebration of Discipline is honest, practical, and humble. I think I was expecting something else. It isn\u2019t the most brilliant theological work that I\u2019ve read in recent days, but it is a devotional/theological work that I will use over and over again as I try to let God work through me."}, {"userName": "Brian Ming", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37845773-brian-ming", "userReview": "I just finished this gem. Although it's taken me some time to get through (due to such a busy schedule), I was disciplined enough to stick with it...See what I did there by celebrating my discipline. In all seriousness, I am very glad I read this book. In particular the sections on worship, on meditation, and especially on the celebration of joy are fabulous. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is seeking to go deeper with God. Surprisingly, even though our culture seems emphatic about the need for the spontaneous and passionate expression of our love affection towards God, there is beauty to be found in the discipline of regiment. It goes far beyond that; our God is a God of order and structure. Let me make this personal: In my relationship with God, I have tended to love him like a much loved relative I see often. What I mean by that is I am delighted to go a few days or weeks without much interaction in the relationship. My daily Bible can be erratic as well my prayer time. Then I end up feeling bad and, upon taking a visit to see my relative (as I continue with the analogy), I tell them, \"I'm sorry It's been a few days (or weeks) since we've really spent quality time...\" Thus goes my journey. But, in this book, I see the benefit of setting up systems of disciplined interaction. Oh, and by the way, let me throw in that one of the reasons I am distant from God is that, sometimes when I come to him, he says nothing--or it just seems dry and stale. What I learned from this book is, that is normal and, even in those time, He appreciated my perseverance to \"press through\" and remain disciplined! Not only really enjoyed the book, but learned a great deal of life-changing principles I will treasure moving forward in my relationship with God."}, {"userName": "Elisabeth Ensor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3046604-elisabeth-ensor", "userReview": "The best book of 2017 for me!!!!

Each chapter focuses on a different discipline of the Christian life, and Foster is quick to offer snippets of his own attempts (failures & successes) in practicing the disciplines. With each discipline he presents both the practical and radical methods of practice. For example, the fasting chapter begins with an argument on the prudence of fasting as a regular part of the Christian life, discusses the physical affects of fasting, addresses some of the practical concerns (what to eat before, after a fast, etc.) and casually ends the chapter with: \"Now is the time for all who hear the voice of Christ to obey it\" (p61).  It is this very aspect of Foster's book that rattles the stomach. You may find yourself nonchalantly reading through his pages, nodding your head, perhaps underlining here and there, your legs stretched across your couch on a lazy afternoon. Then, you will notice a rather burning sensation in your will, realizing with horror that it is pulling an about-face. Your cozy morning Bible snippet no longer fits the bill. You may unfortunately find yourself, as I did, among a group of people agreeing to experimentally practice these disciplines and see if Foster is not perhaps telling some truths. In fact, your church may become so enamored with the idea of intimacy with God that they decide to fast regularly as a body and seek that intimacy together using the disciplines to propel them a bit deeper into Spirit-churned waters. That, I'm afraid, is the very sort of result Foster has in mind. I should add that nowhere does Foster say the disciplines are actually NECESSARY to be a Christian, rather, he says over and over that you'd be sorely stunted to endure the Christian life without them. They need not be practiced perfectly, nor daily, but \"practice\" is key (and \"practice\" implies imperfection)."}, {"userName": "David Woods", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3587053-david-woods", "userReview": "Foster discusses 12 spiritual disciplines. He doesn't waste words. The chapters were succinct, and I found myself underlining often. Great tidbits and suggestions and logistical how-to's as well as discussing the scriptural bases for the disciplines and the fruit that can come as a result. Ultimately, the disciplines in themselves are nothing, but they are various ways to present ourselves before God so that he can bring about spiritual transformation in our lives. Grace is free, but we do have a role to play in our own spiritual transformation/sanctification/spiritual maturity :)  Our paster a couple weeks ago was discussing obedience, and in my best paraphrase he said there was not too much he could do today that would help him to grow in character and maturity, but over the course of years, a trajectory can change.  Spiritual disciplines change the trajectory of our lives and lead us along a different path. As Foster summarizes, \"..it involves a voluntarily accepted and consciously chosen course of action...which will set us before God in such a way that He can produce the needed change... There is a proper place for the will, but it is not in transforming the inner person. The will functions in the decision to place our lives before God so that He may work within us... And that decision is a continual one.\""}, {"userName": "Sameh Maher", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7646745-sameh-maher", "userReview":

Great, great book!"}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4014393-jason", "userReview": "To be clear I'm not your conventional Christian, so bear that in mind if you go any further, and please forgive any irreverence. I suppose many would say I'm not a Christian at all, but luckily all that is between me and God and not His other children. As with most things, I plan to take what I can use from this and leave the rest. Thankfully there is plenty I can use. I found it inspiring, plan to reread it, and will probably find other parts inspiring that didn't speak to me this time. I read this because it's what my Bible study group (where I stick out like a turd in a punchbowl) was doing this session. I go to learn, and grow, and all that happy crappy, and I discovered that I already do a lot of things that are suggested in this book, that some of the others in the group are seeing these kinds of things for the first time, and yet they're the ones with their lives together while I'm at sea and can't tell my ass from a hole in the ground sometimes. Oh well. I still stand by doing a lot of things suggested in this book, for these kinds of things have moved me in the right direction.There are 12 disciplines grouped into 3 categories: inner, outer, and corporate. I didn't find out until halfway through the study what these indicated. Inner disciplines are ones you do within yourself (meditation, prayer, fasting, study). The outer ones are the same, but others can see you doing them and perhaps the results (simplicity, solitude, submission, service... Foster loves his S's). Corporate disciplines involve interacting with others (confession, worship, guidance, celebration). A lot of these build on each other, and if you're swinging all of them, you're probably happy, joyous, and free (or celebrating, if you will).I didn't agree with everything, but opened my mind as much as it would go. Some things with simplicity and guidance were hard to swallow. In fact, I believe my feeling was \"fuck that bullshit.\" Much in simplicity was akin to Marxism which I'm completely against, but there's a caveat that made it more palatable. Giving of one's own free will instead of the state forcing you to do it. That makes all the difference in the world. One is freedom, the other is slavery.Guidance involved allowing others to make some decisions for you, and adhering to the will of a particular group who has prayed the answer for you... If I ever tell you what God's will is for you, then you need to tell me that I've lost my mind. I don't believe I can ever know God's will for anyone but myself. If you come to me with a problem, I can offer my thoughts which may or may not be divinely inspired, and then I need to let it go. I feel it's often God's will for me to say what I said, but whether or not the listener takes it to heart is another matter entirely.The only discipline I took major umbrage with was, surprisingly, prayer. The thoughts in there were so out of line with my own way of praying that I didn't even attend that session for fear that I would flip my shit completely; I'm sure that study was improved by my absence. My prayers are for God's will and the wherewithal to see it. Use me to speak Your words, do Your work here on Earth this day, etc. That's how I roll it out in the morning, I give a thankee sir in the evening, and throw out some feelers throughout the day, and it doesn't need to be any more complicated than that. If I'm praying for someone else it's for His will to be done there also, or I'm pissed off at the person and trying to get over it. The chapter in this book even went so far as to suggest that my prayer can change God's mind. Why? I figure He's got it under control even if I don't see it at the time. And though George Carlin was an atheist, he can explain my sentiments here more succinctly than I ever could.\n  \"What about the divine plan? Remember that? The divine plan. Long time ago God made a divine plan. Gave it a lot of thought. Decided it was a good plan. Put it into practice. And for billions and billions of years the divine plan has been doing just fine. Now you come along and pray for something. Well, suppose the thing you want isn't in God's divine plan. What do you want him to do? Change his plan? Just for you? Doesn't it seem a little arrogant? It's a divine plan. What's the use of being God if every run-down schmuck with a two dollar prayer book can come along and fuck up your plan?\"That's close enough for government work, I reckon. More importantly, though, is I know how my mind works. I suffer from expectations which are simply resentments under construction. If I pray for something to change, then I start to expect that it will. I can't help it; that's just what happens. If those expectations aren't met, I get resentful, and then I have to do a lot of work on myself I could've avoided if I'd just left the thing alone in the first place. If a rock I'm holding is drowning me I can let it go at any time, but it works better if I just don't grab a hold of it at all.And then he started talking about praying to remove faults... I could see it coming from a mile away, and sure enough it showed up: \"pray the gay away.\" Being one of God's favored fags I witness firsthand the ignorance behind this kind of tripe. I'm sexually attracted to men, there ain't a thing I can do about it, and I refuse to spend anymore time making myself miserable trying to change it. God and I've talked about it, He's cool with it, and that will just have to be good enough for sanctimonious straightwads who think they know better. If something changes, I'll address it when it comes around... This seems to have struck a nerve again. Wrap it up for us, Karl.\n  \"The Bible says two men ought not lay together, mmmm hmmm. But I don't reckon the Good Lord would send anybody like you to Hades.\"Enough of my bellyaching. What was good about this? Most everything else. There were some tall orders, but I can understand where he was coming from with all of them. Surprisingly my favorite discipline was fasting. I've done a couple 24-hour deals since we read that chapter, and have found the results beneficial. I confess I had an ulterior motive (weight loss), but did it as suggested anyway. I felt called to try it out, and obeyed. (Obedience is a major theme throughout, which is to be expected. It's a religious book after all). The idea is that every time you feel a hunger pang, you pray about it. Mine went like this: \"Here's another hunger pang, God. It's yours if you want it. If not, I reckon I'll hold onto it a while longer.\" Sometimes it went, sometimes not, but my focus was always diverted to something else. The idea behind it was to get to the \"pray without ceasing\" thing Paul is always going on about. I often wonder how insecure God must be that He needs my attention 24-7, but the answers to such questions are above my pay grade, and I just roll on regardless. Sound alarming to give up my will blindly? Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I don't see where any harm has come to me from doing these kinds of things, and the beauty of it is that if I don't like the results I can quit doing it at any time.Here's a quick run through on some of the others I got something from. Meditation is opening yourself to receive, and here's one place where Foster kind of contradicted himself. He says the posture you use isn't at all important, then talked about the posture he used, and immediately said why it should be done that way and how doing it some other ways might not work as well. Study is mostly paying attention to things around you to receive the Word.Confession involves, well, obviously confessing. Letting another (the right other, mind) know it all. One thing I liked was the notion that the person hearing the confession has the power to give Jesus' forgiveness afterward. There's scripture to back it up, but I'm too lazy to look it up right now; read the book for further details. That explains a few things involving confessions I've done and those I've heard. I didn't see it in the terms described above, but the results were the same. Celebration was pretty awesome. As I mentioned before all of these build one on the other, and celebration is at the end for a reason. If you're doing all these things then joy is a part of you. I remember joy. I'm inspired to try to find it again, but it will take work.Worship didn't do too much for me because it involves so much interaction with other people, but maybe I'm just not there yet. Several parts of service, submission, and solitude almost seemed interchangeable, and I'll need to reread them to get a better understanding. I thought I knew all about service since I try to see where I can be helpful to God or others throughout the day, but the book took it in a different direction, not to mention a rather demanding one. I thought I was good at that shit, but it turns out this young grasshopper has a lot to learn.There was some pooh-poohing of these disciplines as practiced in other religions and spiritual settings, but those were parts I decided to leave behind. I believe trying these things could be helpful for anyone.One last negative note, say sorry. Foster is better read than viewed. There's a video component to this book, and I'm so glad we did only the first one. He is annoying to watch, his speaking style is not above reproach, and I got so distracted by it that I couldn't hear the message. There's also a smugness about him that seems to eventually settle on a lot of people who deal long in the preaching profession, especially if they get airtime. I don't believe he's insincere at all, but it's better to read him that watch or listen to him. At least I found it so.I think anyone interested in trying to do the whole getting-with-God-to-live-a-better-life-for-Him thing could benefit from this book. It also works well for anyone trying to be more spiritual which is really the same thing just wearing a different suit of clothes as far as I'm concerned. But be careful as there are some tall orders in here. I can dig most of them even if I'd rather not, and I think I spelled out the exceptions. The cool thing, though, is that those exceptions for me might work just fine for you.

Foster breaks the disciplines into three categories: inward, outward, and corporate (or collective). While any talk about what to \"do\" for spiritual health can quickly devolve into legalism and shame, Foster emphasizes grace and the idea that God gave us these disciplines as blessings and access points, if you will, to God's presence. They are part of God's design, comparable, perhaps, to natural conditions and states of the world. I keep thinking about microscopes. Humans can't see viruses without a microscope. Using a microscope is not an ethical mandate or the way to perfect scientific knowledge, but a tool we have developed (taking into account the natural abilities of our eyes and the size disparity between humans and viruses) to see and understand viruses. Using a microscope is the best way we can \"access\" a virus visually. Similarly, the disciplines are, on Foster's view, the best ways we know (and have been given) to \"access\" or come into God's continued presence. It is important that Christians engage in them as tools appropriate to our nature and design, but they are not the key to the Christian idea of salvation. Reading about the inward disciplines I felt a little like the choir director nodding along to the sermon, which probably means that those spiritual disciplines come easiest to me and I am probably depending too much on my natural inclinations. I enjoy them, but I should also be more intentional about how I use and develop those strengths/disciplines. I was most challenged by the outward disciplines of submission and service (simplicity and solitude come rather naturally to me), and thinking about them and Foster's arguments is giving me a good framework for how I should act in my very complicated, sensitive, people-focused job. Foster's section on the corporate disciplines was my least favorite. I don't deny that there is a valuable place for confession, worship, guidance, and celebration, but I wasn't terribly thrilled with how Foster presented some of them or argued for how they should be employed. I have seen corporate efforts go so badly that perhaps I didn't feel as though he offered a solution that helps mitigate the worst of human nature well enough. Maybe I'm asking too much of him. Maybe I'm jaded, cynical, and bitter (probably, definitely, and sometimes). Or maybe these disciplines need to be considered more carefully. I don't agree with some of Foster's theological positions, but since this is not an apologetic work (in design or instantiation), those disagreements don't -- or shouldn't -- make an impact on the value of what he is doing with this book. I kept going back and forth between 3 and 4 stars and decided 4 stars was warranted. I am looking forward to putting some of the disciplines into practice this year (fasting and service, BLURGH) and will surely be returning to this book over the years to remind myself that intentional, engaged living is vital to a thriving spiritual life."}, {"userName": "Carla Corinne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20792405-carla-corinne", "userReview": "Took me a while to get through this, but it was a great, helpful book.

Foster spends a chapter celebrating twelve spiritual disciplines, which he divides up into the Inward (meditation, prayer, fasting, study), Outward (simplicity, solitude, submission, service), and Corporate (confession, worship, guidance, celebration) Disciplines. Each of these chapters is well-founded and borrows from a wide variety of Christian sources from across time and tradition.There is a good amount of flow from discipline to discipline, and in some ways I didn't like the categories that structured the book. It was clear that Foster deemed each of the disciplines as not a distinct, check-in-the-box kind of action that all good Christians ought to perform, but as a cog in the whole, healthy Christian life that is postured toward God in every respect. God and his grace are seen as saturating the new-created believer, and Foster often seems reluctant to give specific step-by-step sorts of instructions regarding the practice of any of the disciplines, but (thankfully) in many spots he does. While these instructions will be helpful for anyone diving into the life of discipline (which is really the Christian life) for the first time, Foster is cautious to not turn them into any sort of \"law\" which Christians are bound to. Rather, these disciplines are a joy for the believer to participate in, because they point to and lead to Jesus and the God who pursued them in the first place.My only major complaint with the book is that there was a lack of a sort of \"explicit gospel\" which would have helped ground the practices in the Christian narrative. I believe the gospel is present in the pages, but it is often difficult for the human heart to respond to implication without a clear narrative to orient itself around. However, I highly recommend the read, and I will be returning to the book frequently for reference as I explore the life of discipline further and make it a part of my rhythm."}, {"userName": "Zachary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/769001-zachary", "userReview": "I had forgotten how much of an impression this book had made on me in college, when I worked through it with a small group of friends. We read each chapter and then set out that week to put them into practice in a deliberate and specific way. It was pretty awesome and life-changing, actually. I didn't realize how much of an effect it had upon my personal theology until I just re-read it for a class.Overall, an awesome book. He gives a very balanced, non-legalistic approach to the disciplines. The aspect which I really love is these disciplines are a way to get one's faith out of cerebral acceptance, or even emotional commitment, and into everyday life. There is a reason this book is considered a classic, because it is a very accessible read and quite poignant along the way.This is a great read for lay people as well as clergy and academia.

Sadly I often come back to it because I have fallen away from the life giving habits and practices he outlines. I find I come back out of a sense of guilt, feeling I \"should\" be doing more. And yet here Foster, and Christ through him, meets me in gentleness and encouragement. In these words there is not judgement but hope, and in hope, life. My prayer is that the next time I come back to re-read these words it will be out of a sense of gratitude for the renewed life that walking in discipleship and the disciplines themselves provides."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/725130-elizabeth", "userReview": "This book is potentially life changing.

Foster\u2019s \"CELEBRATION OF DISCIPLINE: The Path to Spiritual Growth\". I have always liked reading and currently have a LONG list of books on my \u201cto read\u201d shelf. However, if this book had not been \"assigned reading\", I doubt I would have ever picked it up. How much I would have missed out! I am excited to say this little book has become one of my all-time favorites; rapidly moving its way up my \u201cTop Ten\u201d book list...before my eyes even graced the final chapters!What I love most about Foster\u2019s writing is how very specific and practical he gets. I have read various books, articles and essays and heard sermons and teachings on some of the same topics he covers. Typically, an author will tell you WHY you should be practicing a given discipline and they will surely use scripture to further back up their statement, but they often stop there...leaving you in this ethereal/philosophical/good-notion state, never getting past the idea and into the tangible, \"how-to\" phase. In CELEBRATION, Foster takes us very specifically through the often missed, yet much needed next step: application. When he presents a discipline he defines it, using scripture to strengthen the need for it; he also uses stories and quotes other writers to enhance our perspective of that discipline...and THEN he tells us exactly HOW to do it, often citing a number of possible ways!Ok, so now you want to know what the spiritual disciplines are, right? Maybe you already have a grasp on what some of them are and you would like to know which ones are covered here. Well, Foster writes about twelve disciplines, separating them into three categories:The Inward Disciplines1. Meditation2. Prayer3. Fasting4. StudyThe Outward Disciplines5. Simplicity6. Solitude7. Submission8. ServiceThe Corporate Disciplines9. Confession10. Worship11. Guidance12. CelebrationI would like to briefly discuss three of them, not because they are my \u201cfavorite\u201d ones, rather I felt I should mention ones which might get overlooked, either because a) we think we already know enough about them, b) they are viewed as \u201ctoo difficult\u201d or, c) they are not as \u201cexciting\u201d as some of the others. My goal is to whet your appetite just a little bit by making these three topics more accessible, hopefully causing you to think, \"If these three are good, the REST of this book must be even better!\"PRAYER\u201cTo pray is to change.\u201d (p. 33) Foster presents a clear case for the huge impact prayer makes in the life of a growing Christian. Prayer is powerful, it transforms us. As wonderful as this is to know, vital in fact, the thing that encouraged me even more was the assurance I gained after reading this chapter regarding the power my prayers have to change others! He gives some practical and even fun ideas of ways to pray for others with boldness: using our God-given imagination, \u201cflash\u201d prayers, faith-filled prayers, silent prayers, etc... I am very excited to begin incorporating each of these forms of praying into my daily life.FASTINGI have felt the desire to fast and have attempted to do so a number of times in my Christian walk (sometimes successfully, sometimes not), but I have never had a solid understanding of HOW to do it properly. I have heard teachings on the WHY of fasting (to enhances one\u2019s prayer life, for example) however, I have never heard a specific \u201cthis is how to do it\u201d before reading this book. Fortunately, rather than simply remaining theological while discussing this topic, Foster gets amazingly practical. He begins by destroying the misunderstandings regarding fasting, then uses scripture to show fasting is strongly recommended (if not commanded). He lists different types of fasting (partial, absolute, extended, group, regular, etc...) and then goes even more in depth in explaining the purposes of a fast and finally gets to the practical stage of the actual practice of fasting, detailing things like: a) what to eat on certain days of the fast (including, during the days just before AND just after the fast itself) and b) what the physical body and the mind will be going through on certain days of an \"extended\" fast. After reading this chapter I can\u2019t wait to try fasting again with a better understanding of what to do, as well as, a better grasp of what to look for when my body is trying to adjust to the fasting process.SIMPLICITYI was also impressed and motivated by the chapter on simplicity. How quickly and easily we humans can mess things up! God calls us to simple obedience and worship, yet we muck things up making our lives so busy and complex. We fill our days with activities and stuff God never intended for us to worry about. How much simpler could our lives be if we only sought God\u2019s approval and not the kudos of men! Once again, this chapter left me wanting to implement the things I learned. It made me want to go through my house, my calendar and my heart and do some spring cleaning!FINAL THOUGHTSWhen Foster presents a case for each of his listed disciplines, as I stated before, he gives very practical steps on how to apply each one. Yet, with a fresh air of humility; he does not come across with guilt or pressure, as some authors do as they try and convince us to actually DO the various disciplines. Rather, he writes in a way which seems to say, \u201cThis is what I recommend from what I and others have learned, but you are free to do as you wish.\u201d This simple, honest way of writing led me to want to incorporate each of the disciplines into my own life...and at the risk of sounding like one of those other authors, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone reading this book and not wanting to begin practicing these disciplines!\u201dI originally wrote most of this review as a book report when I was studying for my ordination. I titled my report, \u201cMy First Impression\u201d. My reason was simple: I plan on reading CELEBRATION OF DISCIPLINE again and again. I also plan on passing this book on to others, so they may be as blessed as I have been. May we all learn the truths shared in this book and begin incorporating the disciplines into our own lives. May we all gain a \u201cdeeper awareness of His presence\u201d and see Him as presently active in our lives. May we all walk down \"the path to spiritual growth\" according to His Spirit from this day forth. And may we all celebrate together as we see each other\u2019s lives transformed through the power of His grace!"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3600828-sara", "userReview": "Again a book from my past - the 80s - that I re-skimmed.

The text\u2019s goals of challenging superficial living and sharing practical ways to focus on living a life of active Christian faith are important and needed ones for the Christian community; and, overall, Foster does a great job of tackling these goals. Foster is clearly insightful and knowledgable. One specific thing I immediately appreciated most was his use of a variety of sources and citations to develop and support his points, which contributed to the book being a well-thought out and rounded source of admonition, not just out-of-context scriptures with over-simplified or unsupported interpretations\u2014which, sadly, many Christian books and sermons are. Throughout the book, I felt myself growing not just as a Christian, but as a person attempting to marry conviction with practicality and as a critical thinker considering how to interpret and apply aspects of faith.While the book\u2019s strengths far outweigh the shortcomings, it\u2019s important to note that I had some trouble with the structure and consistency of the book as a whole. It seemed to me that each chapter was set up differently, which was helpful in that it adapted the writing to the specific topic, but it also made understanding the goal of each chapter difficult; often, I wasn\u2019t quite sure how the parts added up, wondering about the direction of the individual chapters and about how the ideas throughout interacted with each other. Also, a few chapters, such as the one on fasting, focused so much on the practical that I found myself wondering about the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d questions because the \u201chow\u201d so greatly over-shadowed them.Still, this would probably be the first contemporary book I would recommend to anyone trying to grow in their faith, or even anyone simply wanting to learn more about what it means to live as a Christian. The book brilliantly balances simplicity and depth, making it worthwhile to intellectuals and mature believers while still being very accessible. It\u2019s a great one to serve as the center of a discussion group, or just as a personal read\u2014both enjoyable and edifying."}, {"userName": "Tim Chesterton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52476041-tim-chesterton", "userReview": "A very good introduction to the classical Christian disciplines. I first read this book not long after it came out in 1978, and it had a huge impact on me. I have not read it for many years, so it was good to revisit it.This book is an entry level treatment of the disciplines. Foster organizes them into three groups: (1) The Inward Disciplines (Meditation, Prayer, Fasting, and Study), (2) The Outward Disciplines (Simplicity, Solitude, Submission, and Service), and (3) The Corporate Disciplines (Confession, Worship, Guidance, and Celebration). The chapter on meditation was considerably expanded from the original 1978 edition with a much longer treatment of meditation on scripture.Richard Foster writes as a Quaker but he is well acquainted with a wide range of spiritual masters from across the Christian spectrum, from Roman Catholic and Orthodox, to Anglican, to Methodist and Quaker; he also has a warm charismatic streak which I found quite attractive, being a person who was much influenced by the charismatic renewal in the mid-1970s. Perhaps one of the most enjoyable aspects of the book is the way it introduces the reader to so many classical Christian writers (Francois Fenelon, Brother Lawrence, Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, John Woodman, George Fox, Evelyn Underhill, Meister Ekhart, to name just a few).This book repays regular rereading. Each time I have returned to it I have found that a different chapter has especially struck me, which Foster would say is evidence that Jesus our present teacher and guide (a phrase he uses frequently) is speaking quietly into the human heart. This time through the chapters on Service and Confession were the ones that spoke most clearly to me.This book on the classical Christian disciplines is itself a classic, as are Foster's other books. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Mark Oppenlander", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2138167-mark-oppenlander", "userReview": "Before I was even done with this book, I knew that I would need to read it again. I tried to pace myself, and I did read it just a chapter at a time so that it took me almost two weeks to complete this slender tome. However, there was still far too much to contemplate in this book for one reading to do it justice.Perhaps the problem is that the book feels so personal. Richard Foster is aiming to reintroduce the classic Spiritual Disciplines to modern believers. Foster walks his reader through the inward disciplines of meditation, prayer, fasting and study; the outward disciplines of simplicity, solitude, submission and service and the corporate disciplines of confession, worship, guidance and celebration.So why is this personal? Because Foster, like a good pastor, would have us integrate these concepts into our own lives, bringing us to greater knowledge of God and greater freedom in Jesus. And much as it can be sometimes with the teachings of Jesus, we find ourselves resisting. Our conscience is arrested.I found certain chapters easy. I found that I already accepted the described discipline as important, practiced elements of it in my own life and could see myself going deeper with it. Other chapters were very challenging and I balked every step of the way. So this is a book I will undoubtedly revisit at some point.

It is a great book for anyone who wants to get an overall view of the \"classic\" disciplines and how to practice them in daily life. Foster breaks the disciplines down into three categories. First, he discusses the inward disciplines of meditation, prayer, fasting, and study. Then he goes into the outward disciplines of simplicity, solitude, submission, and service. Finally, he delves into the corporate disciplines of confession, worship, guidance, and celebration.I'm currently ready to begin practicing these disciplines seriously in my life, and am glad to be able to read this book again, to refresh my memory, as well as motivate my spirit. I had forgotten so much of what was in this volume, and to read it again was very refreshing and inspirational. And, there is a veritable plethora of other resources mentioned in this book, from the Desert Fathers to modern day authors such as Dallas Willard.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is either simply curious about the disciplines or who is serious about beginning to practice them."}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1884715-abby", "userReview": "Foster's style and quality of writing leave much to be desired. It seems to me that, as he wrote, he thought very little of his reader. The tone is not engaging or endearing, and he speaks to a very narrow audience (namely: married, white, middle-aged or older men) The writing is easy to understand, but it is boring and poorly executed. He does have some valuable things to say, but the reader has to sift through many meaningless and wordy passages. He also insults his reader several times, albeit unintentionally. He insulted me once for being a teenager, once for being a woman, once because he misquoted scripture, and several times for bad grammar. I skimmed through most of it, with a negative opinion of it. However, when I got to the very last chapter, about Celebration, I actually cared about what he was saying, and I appreciated the chapter very much. It is possible that, since the disciplines are so varying, each person may have something valuable to glean from this book.I just can't quite understand why this book has been, and continues to be, so well-received."}], "description": "When Richard Foster began writing Celebration of Discipline more than 20 years ago, an older writer gave him a bit of advice: \"Be sure that every chapter forces the reader into the next chapter.\" Foster took the advice to heart; as a result, his book presents one of the most compelling and readable visions of Christian spirituality published in the past few decades. After beginning with a simple observation--\"Superficiality is the curse of our age.... The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent people, or gifted people, but for deep people\"--Foster's book moves to explain the disciplines people must cultivate in order to achieve spiritual depth. In succinct, urgent, and sometimes humorous chapters, Foster defines a broad range of classic spiritual disciplines in terms that are lucid without being too limiting and offers advice that's practical without being overly prescriptive. For instance, after describing meditation as a combination of \"intense intimacy and awful reverence,\" he settles into such down-to-earth topics as how to choose a place and a posture in which to meditate.  Perhaps most interesting and useful is Foster's chapter on the controversial Christian discipline of submission. According to Foster, submission does not demand self-hatred or loss of identity. Instead, it simply means growing secure in the conviction that \"our happiness is not dependent on getting what we want\" but on the fulfillment that naturally flows from love of one's neighbors. Such wise and encouraging suggestions have helped many readers to discard the idea that discipline is an onerous duty and to move toward a liberating and simpler idea of discipline--whose defining character, as Foster never forgets, is joy. --Michael Joseph Gross", "title": "Celebration of Discipline: The Path to Spiritual Growth", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "average": 4.18, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1382446549l/5312677.jpg", "reviews": 775, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/36065.Richard_J_Foster", "name": "Richard J.
