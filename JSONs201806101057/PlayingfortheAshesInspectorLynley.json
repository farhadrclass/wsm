Elizabeth George gets better by the book. A first class writer and story-teller, that keeps you in your seat, not wanting to put the book down. This one was about the murder of an England Cricketer, Kenneth Fleming, found dead a as result of an arson attack, in the cottage of his lover, who seems to have vanished. There are suspects abound for Lynley and Havers, plenty of motives for the death of Kenneth Fleming, who all in all was a likable guy, but thoroughly misguided. The story is told in two ways, one written like a personal diary by Olivia Whitelaw, a very unlikable character by all accounts, her mother taught Kenny at school and at the time of his death, was his mentor and was providing him with a home since the breakdown of his marriage. The investigation is anything but straightforward and when Lynley does think he has figured out the identity of the killer, he has to use some clever baiting and hope for someone to clear their conscience. I love how Ms. George keeps you guessing to the very end, always a pleasure for me. Lynley has also still not sorted out his relationship with Lady Helen, he is still waiting on an answer to his proposal of marriage and is now losing patience. Will they, won't they? Barbara Havers has moved to her new cottage in Chalk Farm and forms an unlikely friendship. I wish Barbara could find a little romance, she's had a hard life and is turning into a very likable and witty character. Love this series and the upside is, there are still lots to read. This one deserves a full 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283951-eve", "userReview": "Playing for the Ashes is the 7th book in the Inspector Lynley mystery series. Like all of her books, even a seemingly open and shut case is vastly complicated, as the motives for murder, and equally unhelpful suspects, slowly amass. \u201cThe Ashes\u201d historically refer to the prize that is awarded in a Test cricket series played between England and Australia, and is fitting for a title, as the victim in this case turns out to be Kenneth Fleming, a late rising star on England\u2019s team, murdered on the eve of the test matches. Reputable among his loved ones and colleagues, Lynley and Havers set out to flush out a cunning, remorseless killer. The characters are slowly fleshed out, and you have to be patient with all of them as they relate their side of the story. I think this is where George is an expert in her craft and style. You feel like you\u2019re working the case with the detectives; sometimes you even start to feel loyalties and prejudices toward certain characters. I found myself drawn to Fleming\u2019s estranged wife, Jenny Cooper, and her turbulent relationship with her son, Jimmy. They just made my heart ache, and I completely understood her situation. Don\u2019t even get me started on Lynley and Havers, possibly my favorite detective team ever. In this book, they really bridge the gap between colleague and possibly friend. By the end, it is never just a book about a murder, but it almost always leads to reflection on life and intimate relationships. George is one of my favorite mystery writers; I\u2019m pretty sure that this is the only reason why I didn\u2019t give up on this one. It also seems like as I get deeper and deeper into the series, the weight of her books increases! This probably slowed my reading down, as after the first few days of toting it around, I had to opt for leaving it at home. I would read about a chapter a day, and that\u2019s saying a lot, as her chapters tend to be quite long. Still, it\u2019s my opinion that this book didn\u2019t need to be over 600 pages; the open ended conclusion was a bit upsetting as well. As much as I love her, it\u2019s almost like every time I want to pick up the next book in the series, I have to mentally prepare myself for a long, long reading trek. Most of the time it\u2019s worth it; other times it\u2019s just meh. Here\u2019s to hoping the next one will hit a homer out of the park."}, {"userName": "aPriL does feral sometimes ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes", "userReview": "\u201c\u201cIn England the term \u201cthe Ashes\u201d signifies victory in test cricket (cricket played at the national level) against Australia.\u201d\u201dThe preceding quote is from the book. However, if you, gentle reader, are thinking, \u201cI bet actually the title of this mystery genre novel is a sly double entrende about a dead body\u201d you are right! The only thing this book has to do with game of cricket is that one of the characters is a star cricket player. But if you really are a fan of cricket and are expecting a game in these pages at some point, you will be very very disappointed in this book.Readers who are fans of hothouse mysteries - which is what I call mysteries that tend to have a lot of doomed romances, diva performances and extreme angst along with murders and mystery - will find a lot to like in \u201cPlaying for the Ashes\u201d. These hothouse plots do tend to lean to the chick-lit side of the scale, but they still are very entertaining for everyone, in my humble opinion. Both sexes are well represented as heroes or bad guys, the action is dark and deadly and briefly graphic, and it is difficult to quit reading at any point for the last 100 pages because the suspense of not knowing how it ends will drive the reader into missing work or staying up all night.This is the 7th book in the Lynley/Havers mystery series. There is a convoluted plot, a mystery, a murder, tons of characters who could have done the murder, and of course, Thomas Lynley and Barbara Havers, English CID police officers. Since you really should read this series in order (the personal lives of Lynley and Havers are actually at the forefront of the action in almost every one of these novels, as are the distraught self-immolating suspects), the emotional level might be reduced because a reader beginning with the newer books will, in my opinion, not receive the full blast of emo crazy Elizabeth George injects into each and every book in the series. Of course, if emo crazy annoys the crap out of you in the first place, you won\u2019t like this series anyway. In this novel I could not guess who the murderer was, so I was in suspense throughout. I was highly entertained by the operatic plot. Best of all, one of the protagonists was a disgusting person who I would swear was an antisocial personality if she had been a real person, or at least an incredibly immature selfish ninny at best, so I felt free to despise her to my heart\u2019s content, as well as feel superior in every way. What more can any neurotic shy damaged nerdy bookworm with no life such as myself need for temporary validation? I highly recommend this book.These books in the series so far explore realistically, despite the over-the-top self-destruction in each and every character\u2019s life in each book, the emotional devastation that making and living with bad choices brings. I do not find each single instance of coming undone in these novels hard to believe, but the author does not do nuances. ALL of her characters tend to be in their heads as if they were still hormonal high school teens all of the time. I think for most of us readers, we have a friend, relative or acquaintance who did something like a George character once or twice, or we ourselves had a bad time once or twice. George likes to give readers their money\u2019s worth by making sure EVERY character is screwing up really really bad.The character who provided me with so much positive and elevated self-regard was Olivia. Her narrative and life takes up half of the pages, so if she does not pique your interest the book won't be fun for you. Her part in the book was to Live Large as a young adult going on 4 years old. She chooses a life as a drug addict and a prostitute to destroy her parents, who really are very sweet, but for some reason Olivia can\u2019t seem to see them as regular people because they are wealthy and a bit conventional and they want to enjoy an expanded and worthy social life. Everything they do, especially her mother, Olivia misreads as hate, vengeance and abusive control. She can\u2019t seem to like or love them, no matter how benign or ordinary they live their lives or what their expectations are for their daughter. I think she simply has a horror of being controlled so strong that she can\u2019t accept any kind of critical suggestion, much less a parental directive, so that being told it\u2019s time for bed would have been enough to send Olivia into a room-breaking tantrum. Olivia also has a form of jealousy which is world-destroying, and a blinkered overly personalized view of why people expect her to follow directives and set goals. Olivia writes a diary in alternating chapters in 'Playing for the Ashes' about her life which shows how bent her viewpoint is, but I suspect some inexperienced or youthful readers may not see that she overreacts to the world, misreads simple criticism as dislike or hate, and is obviously too self-centered to understand her self-destruction is only important to her family but there is a big world out there that she could have chosen to enjoy on her own. Those of us who have known people like her will recognize the extreme diva mentality who think it\u2019s all about them, no matter what the situation. Thankfully, only a few children, and I\u2019ve known some, will go on to this kind of extreme self-degradation to punish a normal parent (it\u2019s always been a parent in my real experience). In real life, usually normal parents do not entirely blame themselves, but when they do, many have the maturity to recognize, parental guilt or not, that the self-destruction punishes the child more than the parent. Setting oneself on fire because you hated eating Brussels sprouts once a week, or doing homework, can be kinda wasteful of one\u2019s life. At some point, the recognition that living well is the best revenge one can have, if revenge is the point, but actually simply living well for oneself is nice, revenge or not. There was a 4 year old who used the technique of holding his breath to punish anyone who tried to make him do something or did not buy him a toy he wanted. Of course, any sane adult would understand: 1. if he did hold his breath long enough to pass out he would not die but he might bring relief to everyone by being quiet for awhile. 2. he would start breathing automatically again if he succeeded in holding his breath until he passed out. 3. he is an idiot child. Olivia was this kind of person. Boy, did I have fun dissing Olivia every time it was her turn to vent and practice the kind of self-destruction which is meant to rub other people noses in their guilt, but instead results in everyone wondering about that individual\u2019s maturity or sanity, or in my case, thinking, \u201ctoo stupid to live\u201d. The writing is almost literary, but everything is too spelled out for the reader to be actually a literary read. Like I mentioned, I didn\u2019t think it unreal, and I think George knows her emotionally impoverished families. Nobody is exactly polished or civilized, even when they are aristocrats. When I finished this novel, as I also did in finishing the previous books in the series, I felt satisfactorily sated with having lived within every character\u2019s inner trailer-trash.So much fun!"}, {"userName": "Kathy Davie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4222001-kathy-davie", "userReview": "Seventh in the Inspector Lynley mystery series set in modern-day London with Inspector Thomas Lynley and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers with this particular story set in Kent.My TakeExcellent as always. George is rather scary in some ways with how impossible it seems to solve the crime that occurs, and yet she lays it out for us in such a logical manner that it all makes sense in the end, even as she points the finger from one person to another after another.Most of the story is a buildup of the supporting characters. Jimmy, Kenneth's son, is a tearaway whom everyone is expecting to end up in jail. He is so angry with his father for leaving his family and promising the moon, which he never delivers, that he would happily kill his father.Olivia has been the typical wild child and the primary spoke of the wheel, as it's her viewpoint and evidence that is the \"attacking shot\". She's hated her mother, Miriam, for years for caring more for everyone else. It doesn't help that Miriam just has to manipulate everyone into doing what she thinks is best \u2014 Jeannie can testify to this. But at least Miriam is an equal opportunist. Jeannie has been put upon for years and that last encounter may have been the final straw.Peeking at some of other reviews for this particular story, yes, I'd agree that George weighted the story down with in-depth analyses of the other characters that weren't necessary such as Mollinson\u2026but, it was so very fascinating to read her fully-fleshed characters.The StoryThe unexpected discovery of Kenneth Fleming when he's supposed to be flying to Greece for a boating holiday with his son throws everyone, including the Kent constabulary for a loop.Worse, there are so many who would like to see him dead.The CharactersDetective Inspector Lynley plays the press and gets in hot water for it with his superiors at the Yard. Sergeant Barbara Havers is his partner and has made her first friend at Chalk Farm. It'll be interesting to watch this develop. Lady Helen Clyde is a friend of Lynley's.Scotland YardSir David is just itching to take Lynley down nor is he the only policeman Lynley is jerking around. Maidstone's Detective Inspector Isabelle Ardery is finding Lynley rather tyrannical in their so-called equal partnership. Detective Constable Winston Nkata.Kenneth Fleming is a superstar cricketeer, the center around whom everyone involved pivots. Jimmy Cooper is his about-to-be 16-year-old son. Jeannie Cooper is his wife. Georgina is his fianc\u00e9e. Guy Mollison is the captain of the English cricket team.Miriam Whitelaw, Kenneth's teacher, most fervent supporter, and eventual best friend owns Celandine Cottage. Olivia is her daughter.Living on a barge, Chris Faraday is an architect specializing in remodeling old homes. Amanda.Martin Snell is the milkman.The TitleThe title is a play on a particular cricket game, The Ashes, traditionally played between England and Australia. The fact that this particular cricketeer died from carbon monoxide in a house fire\u2026well, I'll leave it to you to judge as to how much of a play the title is."}, {"userName": "Toni Osborne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1970656-toni-osborne", "userReview": "Book 7 in the Inspector Lynley seriesThis is one edge of the seat gripping mystery offering several plots within its main plot, a great work of detective fiction, one of Ms George\u2019s best.The story opens when the body of England\u2019s leading batsman Kenneth Fleming is discovered in a burnt out country cottage, an apparent victim of arson. Inspector Lynley and his partner Barbara Havers are called in from Scotland Yard to help the local police.

Through her characters, the author explores in depth the hate-love relationship people have for each other and their reaction facing adversity. Olivia who provides much of the story in her own words is a rich and complex character.

The soap opera is more engrossing than usual, even though the first character introduced, Olivia, is so vile that I thought for a while that I wasn't going to enjoy the book at all. Her story is presented in first person, as she's writing an accounting of her life, and the early chapters are seriously off-putting.Because of the title (the term \"the Ashes\" signifies victory in test cricket against Australia) I was half hoping, half dreading that there would be a lot of information about that mysterious English sport, but there isn't much. The book has nothing to do with Australia, either. We do have a murder victim who's a famous batsman for England.I don't normally seek out contemporary mysteries. It was the British setting that attracted me to these (and the fact that I could borrow all of them from my mom) but the writing keeps me reading them. The melodrama is almost over-the-top, but I'm consistently drawn into the characters' lives, most especially that of Lynley and Havers.

(Olivia in particular, who is misanthropic and virulently self-destructive up until the last few pages.) As is her wont, sports and causes are invoked (cricket and anti-vivisectionism). She overwrites: \"Sodden cornflakes and ever-darkening banana slices marked the trajectory of the cereal bowl she'd upended.\" First, this is too many adjectives. Second, no one cares about the trajectory of some cornflakes and banana slices. It is a meaningless detail of the type that festoon her books. But occasionally she will semi-redeem herself by having Chief Superintendent Hillier call Lynley a \"glib little fanny rat.\" What a fanny rat is, exactly, I don't know. But I would like to. Naturally for me it conjures images of gerbils and Richard Gere, but maybe I am way off base."}, {"userName": "Lisa (Harmonybites)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2596042-lisa-harmonybites", "userReview": "I thought this one was an improvement over Missing Joseph, the last entry in the Lynley Mysteries and my least favorite of the novels to date. That one barely featured my favorite character in the partnership of Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers--here she's back in form. And it's not just her presence per se I missed, I think Lynley is a better, more interesting character with her to play off of as well. I remember one scene--the \"Kwai Tan\" bluff by Barbara where I smiled widely thinking this is a lot of why I love this character. And for once both the personal subplots with Havers and Lynley were hopeful and positive. I was particularly charmed by Havers developing a friendship with Hadiyyah--a charming little girl, seven going on eight, who is her neighbor.The title \"Playing for the Ashes\" is a cricket term, and this mystery involves the murder by arson of cricket star Kenneth Fleming who rose from working class roots to play for England. Three very different women loved him and have been loved by him. There's Miriam Whitelaw, his former teacher, old enough to be his mother, who he was living with at the time of his death. There's Jean Cooper, the wife he's been separated from for years who still hopes she can get back his love. And there's Gabrielle Patten, his lover and wife of the team sponsor. It's these women, and those connected with them--Miriam's daughter, Jean's son, Gabrielle's lovers and husband--who hold the key to his death. In a departure from George's usual style, the third person narrative is punctuated throughout with chapters in first person from the point of view of Olivia Whitelaw, the daughter of Miriam. Like one reviewer, I found this off-putting, especially since this begins the book and I found I greatly disliked Olivia. That never changed, even if I did find myself having sympathy for her by the end. I also noted this novel in the series overindulged in crude language. I'm no prude, and I don't usually even notice the use of obscenities, but in this case I felt a bit assaulted by their use. I also felt the Olivia chapters, and other scenes not involving the two detectives, were overlong and by and large an unnecessary drag on the narrative. The first Lynley mysteries, such as the first, A Great Deliverance were not much longer than 400 pages. This one was close to 700 pages. I worry George is succumbing to the problem you see in successful, and thus unedited, authors such as Tom Clancy and Stephen King, where their novels become bloated.

While Olivia is unlikable in many instances, her story is interesting and develops in ways I didn't expect. In addition to the central mystery of the whodunnit, the story is propelled along by the mystery of her past and how she connects to the crime. Also I realized after the sixth book, Missing Joseph, that I actively dislike Deborah. Since she is not in Playing for the Ashes, I enjoyed the book a lot more. At first in the series, I was interested in how Deborah was connected to Lynley and Simon, but once that was explained, I had a hard time understanding or sympathizing with her feelings about motherhood. Each time George delved into Deborah's personal drama in Missing Joseph, I was uncomfortably reminded that she is 24--so young and, despite being married, so immature. I still feel squicky about how her relationship with her \"brother-uncle\" Simon became a romantic relationship. Reminders of her continued immaturity do not dispel the squickiness, but only reinforce it. I'll take 10 books of Havers over another 10 pages about Deborah. I've gotten off topic, but that is a major part of why I prefer Playing for the Ashes over Missing Joseph (if only it had been called Missing Deborah). Feelings about Deborah aside, I like the balance between Havers' and Lynley's personal lives and the mysteries large and small in Playing for the Ashes."}, {"userName": "Hannie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16141759-hannie", "userReview": "Een interessant thriller van Elizabeth George, met wederom inspecteur Thomas Lynley en brigadier Barbara Havers in de hoofdrol.

De boeken van Elizabeth George hebben altijd een wat trage opbouw en het duurt vaak lang tot je bij de ontknoping bent. Dat is het wachten echter wel waard. Haar boeken draaien vaak meer om het mysterie dan om actie. Alle kanten van een zaak en alle mogelijke verdachten komen aan bod. Daardoor word je soms ook op het verkeerde been gezet.

Een minpuntje vond ik dat de hoofdstukken soms vrij lang zijn. Ik lees graag van hoofdstuk naar hoofdstuk. Als ik dan nog weinig tijd had om te lezen, begon ik niet altijd meer aan een nieuw hoofdstuk. Daardoor duurde het toch wat langer voor ik het boek uit had. Het verhaal leest wel redelijk vlot.

Although there are the main characters of Thomas Lynley (posh detective and reluctant Lord), frumpy but ballsey sidekick policewoman, best friend handicapped forensic scientist who is married to his butler's beautiful photographer daughter who once ran around with said posh detective, etc. the author used varied means to tell the story in each book. One book may be told from the main detective's point of view, the next from the sidekicks', the next may keep these characters in the background while the focus is on the more direct participants in the crime at hand.

Lynley risks being pulled from the case when he fails to get the solid results he needs during his investigation. He is forced to stray far from New Scotland Yard protocol and is warned by his superiors he is jeopardizing his career. But Lynley is after the truth no matter what the cost in this case which explores the various faces of love and the emotional, physical, ethical and moral nature of choice. The title of the novel refers to a term used in cricket, Britain\u2019s widely popular sport. Kenneth Fleming, a handsome star batsman, is found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in the upstairs bedroom of a partially burned cottage in Kent owned by his mentor and wealthy patron Mariam Whitelaw. At the time, the cottage was occupied by a beautiful woman named Gabriella Patten, who was separated from her husband Hugh Patten, the sponsor of Ken\u2019s cricket team and also Ken\u2019s lover. Fleming was in the middle of proceeding with a divorce from his wife Jean Cooper with whom he had three children. Jean loved Ken and wanted him back despite their four year separation.The initial investigation quickly concludes the fire was deliberately set and with such a popular, high profile national figure dead, New Scotland Yard is called in to help Greater Springham C.I.D. solve the crime. The media descend, are a constant presence during the case and become a large part of the story.Friends and family were shocked by the announcement of Ken\u2019s death as they all thought he had taken his eldest son, sullen sixteen year old Jimmy, on a long planned sailing holiday in Greece. They were to leave the night Ken died. Olivia Whitelaw, is Miriam\u2019s only child. The two have been estranged for over ten years and have neither seen nor spoken to one another, both intent on never forgiving the other for perceived injuries and sins. When readers meet her, Olivia lies on a barge on one of London\u2019s canals, completing a document she has been writing over several days. She suffers from A.L.S. and the disease is slowly and relentlessly stealing her physical mobility. Long ago Olivia had broken free of the constrictive bourgeoisie life she lived with her parents in Kensington and had opted instead for a life of sex and drugs. She was saved by Chris Faraday, a man devoted to animal rescue who was also impervious to her charms. He had made it clear there was no connection between the two of them even when she made it clear that that was the way she wanted it. She has lived with Chris on the barge with his various pets for several years now. Olivia never met Ken, but she heard about him constantly through her mother\u2019s conversations when she was still at home. She has followed their relationship in the gossip reported in the papers which over the years cast rumour and innuendo on the unlikely partnership of a batsman still in his thirties and the wealthy elderly lady who was in her sixties.It is not long into the case when there is a major breakthrough. But Lynley is not impressed by the confession which he knows is full of holes. While others are pleased at the break in the case, Lynley remains absolutely uncompromising in getting to the truth. When he finally believes he knows the guilty party, he realizes the killer has an airtight alibi and only one person can refute it. The resolution of the case reveals compromising truths that could affect several lives and Lynley must make a difficult decision about whether to follow the law or what he believes is the moral path. Once again the underlying theme of choices girds the storyline. Inspector Lynley is at a frustrating juncture in his personal life. For the second time he is proposing to Lady Helen Clyde who is still waffling about accepting his offer. She finally makes her decision which is a good thing. Her continual perseveration was becoming annoying not just to Lynley but to George\u2019s many readers!Sergeant Havers has moved into her new digs in Chalk Farm, breaking the chain that held her to her ailing and dead parents. She still hangs on to a measure of guilt about placing her mother and is also finding it difficult to meet her commitment to visit her at Hawthorne Lodge on a regular basis. Work drains her, she has neither the time nor the energy for social interaction at the end of the day and her mother who is often confused, sometimes does not recognize her. George gives each of her characters a unique voice and we hear events from each of their different points of view. Her skillful portrait of Olivia who is initially portrayed as a repulsive character but gradually over many pages becomes someone who garners our sympathy, once again demonstrates her talents as a competent writer. George gives her readers a good mystery, but she sometimes draws her stories out for too long and this is one of them. Apart from that criticism, this is a solid addition to the ongoing series."}, {"userName": "Stef Rozitis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31302654-stef-rozitis", "userReview": "I liked this one better than the last one of these I read. I was quite engaged in Olivia's story for most of the book. In the end I just got worn down by sheer volume, there was too much of everything- emotion hardship, more emotion, miscommunication loneliness etc making all together a melancholy mood but I wasn't really into it. 680 pages is almost always too many and it was too many for me here- there were too many different things going on.I am glad I liked Olivia because I really loathed most of the characters- Kenneth, Miriam, Garbriella. When it came to Jean and Jimmy I had an appalled sort for pity for them without wanting to spend much time with them and then there were scores and scores of support characters who were a little bit too well developed (I subscribe to the idea that you want to really engage with about three characters more than that becomes exhausting and/or confusing).The murder was well plotted and Olivia's story was well used within that without making it obvious too early who did it (well it became obvious too early, but not because of Olivia and by then I was a bit worn down by other aspects of the story too). Lynley and Havers are portrayed as polar opposites in a way that I think is supposed to make Lynley look really shiny and flatter him but to me he looks like a rich sexist (better censor out the word that comes to mind here). I continue to feel furious at the way Havers has no real role within the series apart from failing to be as privileged confident or powerful as Lynley. Initially I thought I would like that there was a female inspector in the book but she was just there for Lynley to be horrible to and tellingly wasn't even in on the end.I have no time whatsoever for Lady Helen. She is toxic femininity personified- useless, irrational, beautiful (of course) and sympathetic to the male gaze. Every time she appeared in the book I cringed at the things she said or that Lynley said about her. Inexplicble and wearying: I felt there was an attempt to explain the \"brilliant man attracted to ditzy female\" phenomenon without a sound understanding of gender and in particular how insecure masculinity is. Nevertheless Lynley musing (and Helen's demand) on why he loves her took in surprisingly archaic notions such as \"distraction\" (a reformulated and slightly dysfunctional version of home as the feminine sphere) and then settled on the fact that she was \"oh so sympathetic\" so that this useless gnat of a human mind at least had the virtue of focussing on him the supreme (narcissistic) male. Lynley is a curious character for a female to have written because his narcissism is so sympathetically presented.Of course Havers has no lovelife. In all things she must be opposite to and inferior to Lynley.I've been scathing- aspects of this one were good. I liked the positive portrayal of animal activism, I liked that an awful lot! I also really did like that Olivia was such an \"outlaw\" and was written in a way that stressed the importance (and problem) of agency. Even though the uneducated working class characters (such as Jean and Jimmy and horrible Uncle Derek) were portrayed in such stereotypical ways, there was still a degree of sympathy for their desires and needs in life, and especially for the way family mattered to them.I have read worse."}], "description": "\"The story begins with my father, actually, and the fact that I'm the one who's answerable for his death.\u00a0\u00a0It was not my first crime, as you will see, but it is the one my mother couldn't forgive.\"In her astonishing New York Times bestseller, acclaimed author Elizabeth George reveals the even darker truth behind this startling confession.
