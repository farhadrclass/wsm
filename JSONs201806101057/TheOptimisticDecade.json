A man in a turban and white tunic glided by on roller skates. A woman in a wheelchair held the leashes of two dogs that pulled her along the path, American flags waving from the back of her chair. There were bikinied women swaying back and forth on Rollerblades. Teenagers on lowriders eating cones of soft-serve while biking. Men biking while holding boom boxes. A girl like a statue on a skateboard, carrying a Coke can which held a single bird-of-paradise stalk . Rebecca explained at length why the supposed literary canon wasn\u2019t actually canonical. The world might end if she stopped talking, she would talk on and on for the preservation of the world, as all the world\u2019s peoples rolled by, oblivious to their salvation, just hours before the war started.\u201cPolitical activism and protest is near to my heart; I consider myself a Revolutionist. That\u2019s what this debut novel is: revolutionary in the political sense, an examination of youthful idealism versus the cold hard reality that things don\u2019t change for the good so easily. On a word-by-word, line-by-line basis, this is one of the most exquisite novels I\u2019ve read thus far this year. The English language is clay in this author\u2019s hands (see the quoted passage above). She successful conveys simple and complex emotions and ideas, never phoning it in or caving under the pressures of writing a freshman effort. This long and winding tale of a summer camp in the Colorado mountains has the gravitas and staying power of a literary veteran\u2019s work.And though this novel is very setting-specific \u2014 it takes place in summer 1990, just before the Gulf War \u2014 it is incredibly universal, and it is in that lies this author\u2019s greatest strength: her tale of young adults wanting to hold onto various meccas \u2014 both physical and metaphorical \u2014 is a mirror. In it I saw myself, and I\u2019m sure other readers will, too.Thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for the ARC.

It almost reminded me exactly of The Interestings, which I finished not too long ago and enjoyed quite a bit (I actually read that one feverishly, on a long 11 hour plane ride, and closed my Kindle with my eyes sore and my head aching from a book hangover). Anyway, spoiler alert, I did not like this book nearly as much as The Interestings. I'm not sure if it's because: 1) most of the book was set in rural Colorado, deliberately positioned in the middle of nowhere. Camping? Gross. 2) the characters felt very cold and I felt detached from the plot. I dislike the critique of characters being \"unlikeable\", but I really did find all the characters unlikeable and most importantly, I didn't care for any of them. The stakes felt low to me, because I just didn't have any investment in anybody. That being said, the last 20% of so of the book was the most interesting and well-thought out. I like what the author was trying to explore with the concept of a summer camp isolated from any political action or concern and this cult-like figure who rebels against society by isolating himself, acknowledging that though this is a privileged way to live, each individual's action matters and he's making a political statement by his lifestyle alone. And I appreciated Rebecca's formerly optimistic leftist parents Georgia and Ira (is it a coincidence that they share the same name with the couple of Yo La Tengo???) and their disillusionment with protest and activism. I think it makes for interesting discussion questions, especially in this Trump era: what's the point of getting involved and resisting if everything sucks and will probably continue to suck? Do we make a difference at all? Can we ever make a difference? How do you live your best life? Does this book have a conclusion? Sort of, because the last scene sort of made my heart jump with joy.

Below is my honest review, and all opinions are my own.I rate this book a 4 out 5 Stars.This was an artfully written coming of age story, and it was a fantastic way to kick off my Summer reading. Llamalo was essentially a hippie summer camp in Colorado. I loved the characters in this book, they each brought a uniqueness to the story, and were relatable, charismatic, and loveable. I found Caleb to be funny, and wise beyond his years, a good guy to be mentoring others. Out of all of them though, David was my favorite. He was just so sweet and reminiscent of people I knew when I was a young adult.I enjoyed the political undertones of this book, it wasn't in your face, and shoved down your thought. It was just simply what was going on in the outside world, and how it affected this group of people (well everyone actually). \"The Optimistic Decade\" travels through the Regan and Bush Sr. Era, it covers idealism, political activism, and the ideological\u00a0dreamers, who wanted to make changes. It was important than, and it's more important in the world we live in now. I really just enjoyed this book, it's unlike anything I typically read and I am so grateful it was sent to me by Algonquin.

Perhaps, it is best described as a story of idealism, which most of us have in our 20s, but which often erodes as we get older and get worn down by reality and practicality; but there is always another generation of idealists to take our place, to race our hopes, and, perhaps, to create another \"optimistic decade.\""}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64585245-ryan", "userReview": "I received this book through a Goodreads Giveaway, and I would like to thank the author and Algonquin Books for the free copy.

The story offers insights about ideological exhaustion and jadedness, difference in generations, and how people who want to change the world often find themselves in conflict with one another.

I know. You are looking at the early reviews of this book on this page, and most of them are overwhelmingly positive. And then here I come, the Naysayer, the Grump, the Whiny Whiner Who Whines. . . And I get it. From an objective standpoint, I can see what people liked about The Optimistic Decade. For one thing, it was well written, maybe even exceptionally so, considering this is an author\u2019s debut novel. The camp landscape descriptions were absolutely on point. And I even think that the writer accomplished the ambitious goal that she likely had in her mind, when she set out to write this novel. That goal was (I suspect) to establish (through the tale of one very unique summer camp\u2019s decade of history, a timeline that hopped, skipped and jumped, across three presidents, about 15 years -- from the mid 70\u2019s to the early 90\u2019s-- and four or five main characters) the notion that, regardless of our social standing and political views, all of us will inevitably go through a period in our lives when we are sublimely hopeful in our belief that we can \u201cmatter\u201d to this world. Unfortunately, that belief will, at some point in our existence, ultimately be, at least somewhat, shattered, thus causing us to re-evaluate our identity and place in society at large.Yet, all that being said . . . here\u2019s the thing: I personally, just didn\u2019t enjoy reading this book. I found it to be a chore. In fact, about 150 pages into reading The Optimistic Decade, I stopped the book completely, read an entire book that was actually longer than The Optimistic Decade, gave that book a five-star review on Goodreads, and reluctantly came back to finish this one. One of the reasons this novel didn\u2019t work for me, I think, was that I just wasn\u2019t interested, or, to be honest, all that knowledgeable, about the time-period in which it took place, at least from the solely political viewpoint from which it was situated . . . My own \u201coptimistic decade\u201d having taken place a couple decades later. Do I guiltily enjoy some 80\u2019s music, and the occasional John Hughes movie? Sure. Am I at all conversant in the Exxon Valdez crisis or the ins and outs of the Persian Gulf War? Not in the least. And I\u2019m not ashamed to admit that either.Beyond the political backdrop of the story, I found that I was unable to relate to any of the novel\u2019s main characters . . . three-dimensional and well-developed, though they might have been. The female protagonist\u2019s muckraking father? A selfish, egotistical, man-child, willing to put his own ego ahead of his family\u2019s happiness and the livelihood of the many people he employs. Donnie? An uneducated, Anti-Semitic asshole, who suffers from toxic masculinity and a crippling sense of entitlement.  Bored, lazy, na\u00efve hippie, born ten-years too late, David; and uptight, virginal, intellectual snob, activist Rebecca fare slightly better in the story. Each of these characters, on their own, may even have had the opportunity to evolve into much more likeable characters, were it not for the odious Caleb and the If It Existed in Real Life, It Would Probably Be The Subject of A Massive Class Action Lawsuit And Numerous Arrests Camp Llamalo.I think my biggest problem with The Optimistic Decade is that Caleb is initially treated as a \u201cvisionary,\u201d and later, even when his flaws are exposed, as a \u201cgenerally good guy.\u201d After all, Caleb founded and runs, Llamalo, a camp that the author and its inhabitants all seem to think is \u201clive-changing\u201d and \u201cawesome,\u201d but to me seems like \u201ca cult\u201d and \u201chas way too many similarities to a Charles Manson Family-type situation\u201d to be an at all healthy experience for any human being.Is Caleb revered by the campers and counselors at Llamalo as a godlike character? Yup! Is the camp situated in the middle of nowhere, and its inhabitants practically forbidden from contacting the outside world, or enjoying the comforts of modern technology, which would undoubtedly remind them of the truly effed up situation in which they are currently trapped? Uh-huh. Is minimum hygiene practiced, such that everyone on the campground showers maybe once a week, foregoes any kind of shaving, rarely changes clothing, and is regularly stinky and covered with dirt? You bet! Despite all this generalized nastiness among the camp population, does Lord Caleb regularly select/ almost force the \u201chottest\u201d girl in the camp to come to his yurt at night and sleep with him? Ab-so-friggin-lutely.I\u2019m sorry. But I feel like a major requirement for enjoying The Optimistic Decade was that I root for Caleb, and praise Llamalo for getting Rebecca laid, and causing her to question her dedication to political causes, and I just couldn\u2019t do it. As for the novel\u2019s ending, after all the build up regarding the challenge to Caleb\u2019s right to the land on which the camp was run, and the Big Secret that Rebecca\u2019s family was keeping from her all summer, it all (to me anyway) ramped up to a rather hastily added-on conclusion, which was then rushed into a tidy wrap-up, in an a-bit-too-pat epilogue type chapter.In short, while I commend The Optimistic Decade for its impressive writing style, ambitious theme, and well-developed, if seriously flawed, main characters, none of these attributes ultimately resulted in an enjoyable read for me, personally."}, {"userName": "Nancy Mijangos", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35012049-nancy-mijangos", "userReview": "Good novel about idealism, protests, and the success or futility of it all depending upon the person and his/her ability to weather disappointment in others and society in general."}, {"userName": "BJ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1041912-bj", "userReview": "So I had the opportunity through Netgalley to read this book before it is released today, May 1. I promised them a fair review, so here you go.The Optimistic Decade by Heather Abel is a book about an extended family of radical American liberals. (We assume the May 1 publication date to be a coincidence). The story centers around Llamalo, a summer camp located in Colorado in a true, honest-to-goodness-tarantula-walking wilderness. The idea is that the campers undergo a transformation when they live stripped of all the vestments of society and culture, something out of Desert Solitaire or Thoreau, both of which are heavily quoted.Perhaps this book\u2019s strongest feature is its powerful sense of place. Most of the book takes place at Llamalo and Abel truly excels at building the story around the camp and its routines. It reminded me a little bit of what Amor Towles did in A Gentleman in Moscow with the hotel. You know where people are sleeping (hint: outdoors), how they sleep, how their day goes, what projects they are working on, etc. You know when they eat, how they know its time to eat, where they have their gatherings etc.I went to summer camp and this was all very familiar and comforting to me. Mine was in a much tamer version of wilderness, but the freedom camp gives to young people to spend hours on some project and to go swimming in the river and not have their parents over their shoulder every second\u2013its a twinkle in the eye of life.The sense of place supports the book throughout, a comfortable and familiar host to what is right and what is wrong with the people who are interacting with it. And lastly, the wilderness is, in theory, immutable and unspoiled, and yet there\u2019s a metaphor here, because we understand that anything that has been touched by a human has been \u201cspoiled\u201d (or changed or impacted or altered) in some way.The plot develops very well. It certainly is not a fast-paced Dan Brown page-turner, which is fine with me. It is easy to read. At one point, about halfway through the book, I had no idea how we could only be half-way through, but Abel does a nice job mixing in new elements to keep the story moving along to a satisfying conclusion.The characters are excellent and come from a diverse set of ages and types, which is reflective of Abel\u2019s storytelling skill. You have the aging, doubting radical, his unwavering wife, a teenage boy and a teenage girl coming of age, along with the camp director and a semi-literate Native American (the protagonist). With one exception, I found all these characters to be well-drawn. In particular, the elegant description of Rebecca\u2019s physical sensations as she discovers her sexuality was very effective, along with David\u2019s struggles to fit into the wider world.The one place I felt the book could be stronger was the development of Donnie, the protagonist. His actions, which are extreme and the result of a long-held grudge, just never rang 100% true to me and I feel like some time inside his head during the development of the story might have created a stronger drama.The book\u2019s title refers to the idea that everyone in their life has a decade when everything is going great. When they think can change the world. When there are Newtonian physics in play, when you take an action and you get a reaction.Of course, if there\u2019s a decade where you have this feeling, the darker implication is that it is not something that can last forever. There are seasons to our lives, and not all of them are summer. Human fallibility is our gravity. It can be defied but it cannot be defeated.Rather than live in dirty, flawed world, the characters\u2013like Abbey and Thoreau\u2013have attempted to reset the board by going to a virgin wilderness, a blank slate free from the surly bonds of human life. But even there, you have an optimistic decade and then you have the other ones. Even mountains have seasons to their lives.If this makes the book sound hopeless and bleak, that\u2019s a mistake. In the end, we see the characters understanding that living in a flawed world and in our un-optimistic decades is the business of our lives. It\u2019s a paradox. The idea that there are seasons to life is itself timeless."}, {"userName": "Taylortbush", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6170368-taylortbush", "userReview": "I honestly don\u2019t even know where to begin with this book. It\u2019s god awful. I wanted so badly to like it just like I know this book wanted to be good, but it severely misses the mark.Everything about the book is just so trite. Characters are cookie-cutter, rationales and motivation are thin, she tells more than shows and everything is dialed up to the extreme. I get that Heather Abel wanted to write a book about idealism and specifically the adolescent ideal (even the most dim-witted person could gather this from the way Heather bashes the reader over the head with examples of this), but to do that effectively you still need to have some kind of nuance and non-idealism to your characters and world. I did like the book at some parts, but those were the parts where she got specific and wasn\u2019t dealing in the morass of tropeyness (describing the camp, the love story at parts, the 80\u2019s/90\u2019s politics). Generality is her big problem here. The third-person perspective and POV shifts really create a clinical distance from the story. The camp was supposedly great, because it was mentioned as being great every other page, but it was never really SHOWN as being great. You might argue that\u2019s part of showing the adolescent ideal (the shellacking of everything into more than what it is), but it doesn\u2019t quite translate to novel storytelling where things need to be more than just ideals. It makes things feel too nebulous and ungrounded. She\u2019s too distant from the world/heart of her novel; I never felt like she \u201cbecame\u201d her characters. Instead she writes them in a way that feels judgmental and condescending, which creates an impediment for the reader to really connect with her world. If you\u2019re going to write about kids and their mistakes you have to develop those mistakes as seeming like the right decisions. It\u2019s like an atheist writing about Catholicism. I think this could\u2019ve been avoided had she adopted the 1st person and either stuck to one perspective or switched perspectives through the channels of 1st person.This really could\u2019ve been a great book about the futility of activism and the hypocrisy of liberalism, but unfortunately Heather just doesn\u2019t possess the chops to write that kind of story. Instead she deals in broad strokes and generalities and rests on the familiar without really subverting too much. Right off the bat she bungles the inciting incident of the novel (Rebecca, a young liberal trying hard to prove her worth as an adult is completely against going to a childish summer camp, but she makes a strident 180 on the next page) and this flimsy plotting continues all throughout the book (at one point a jaded benefactor who refuses to fund said summer camp changes his mind in the blink of a paragraph). These aren\u2019t just little moments either these are the BIG pivotal moments that the novel hinges on and if it weren\u2019t for them the rest of the book wouldn\u2019t exist\u2014and Heather just squanders them all. I think for her next work she should stick to nonfiction. She\u2019s a great expository writer, but the essential tenets of a good novel\u2014plot progression, characterization, thematic weaving\u2014she just does not have a grasp on, nor the ability to subvert them. Being able to describe sagebrush does not a good novelist make.Cover is pretty awesome though!"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8852506-kim", "userReview": "The \u201cOptimistic Decade\u201d when so many thought they could effectuate change by writing and talking and discussing.

Rebecca, a social-conscious college student, has been shipped off to be a counselor instead of getting to work on her family's paper. David, a seventeen year old nobody, has been coming to Llamalo for years, and hopes to move there permanently when he turns eighteen. Caleb, leader of the camp, is trying to maintain order and make everyone feel the same way he does about Llamalo and what it stands for. Don and Donnie, father and son duo and original owners of the land, are struggling with what their ranch has become and how to do something about it. This books is told through the points of view of all these characters. It takes place throughout the Eighties (as flashbacks) and Nineties (as present day) through the Reagan and Bush eras. The flashbacks take the reader back to times like when David and Rebecca were kids, and when Caleb first discovered Llamalo, helping the reader to understand why things are they way they are at present in the story. The Optimistic Decade was very atmospheric and character driven. Not a lot happens, but in this book that works well. I felt transported right into Llamalo, with its hot sun, gorgeous views, and minimalist lifestyle. I really loved both Rebecca and David as characters, and getting to see them each grow individually, as well as build their relationship with one another. I also loved a lot of the minor characters, including Suze and Georgia.It covers a lot of challenging and thoughtful topics, including idealism, flawed leadership, and political activism. The characters in the story think a lot about whether or not their actions make a difference, and there are many eye opening moments for each of them. The writing was beautiful and the novel was well constructed. Overall I really enjoyed this novel, but I was left still wanting something more when it was all said and done.Overall Rating: 4 out of 5 starsThanks so much to Algonquin Books for sending me an advanced copy of this perfect summer read!"}, {"userName": "Colton", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18040491-colton", "userReview": "I don't know, this one just didn't gel for me. I rarely knew what was even happening in each scene, there were too many characters that were too ill-defined, and none of their motivations made sense. The plot sounded interesting, but the writing style really made it a slog. Do not read the summary and go into this thinking it's going to be about a 90's summer camp that slowly turns into a cult. This is a slow-moving character drama with no action and little drama. Despite a few moments of genuine introspection, The Optimistic Decade left me as dry as the desert."}, {"userName": "Bookish", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1149347-bookish", "userReview": "A young man grieving the loss of his father searches for direction in his life.

I'm sure there would have been all sorts of revelations, growth, transformation, epiphanies... the characters were flawed enough for change to happen! I just didn't have the patience. My inability to give a shit might be more about where my head is right now than the book, though.

I\u2019ve come to believe that small, but important steps can be as monumental as sweeping dreams of utopia. \u201cSuch typical Ira bullshit, creating a universal theory out of his own personal malaise.

Framed by the oil shale bust and the real estate boom, by protests against Reagan and against the Gulf War, The Optimistic Decade takes us into the lives of five unforgettable characters and is a sweeping novel about idealism, love, class, and a piece of land that changes everyone who lives on it. There is Caleb Silver, the beloved founder of the back-to-the-land camp Llamalo, who is determined to teach others to live simply. There are the ranchers, Don and his son, Donnie, who gave up their land to Caleb and who now want it back. There is Rebecca Silver, determined to become an activist like her father and undone by the spell of both Llamalo and new love; and there is David, a teenager who has turned Llamalo into his personal religion. Heather Abel\u2019s novel is a brilliant exploration of the bloom and fade of idealism and how it forever changes one\u2019s life.", "title": "The Optimistic Decade", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35489157-the-optimistic-decade", "average": 3.64, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1508066439l/35489157.jpg", "reviews": 39, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9856134.Heather_Abel", "name": "Heather Abel"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35489157-the-optimistic-decade", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38236653-the-optimistic-decade", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23565970-gut-instincts"]}
