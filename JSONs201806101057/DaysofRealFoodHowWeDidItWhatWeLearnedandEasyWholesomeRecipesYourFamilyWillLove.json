Obviously, the author feels that GMOs are bad, adn lists a bunch of fruits/vegetables that are 'at risk' or whatever for being modified. And I'm sitting there like, lady, ORANGES ARE GMOS.

Her and her husband live in Charlotte, which is one of the most expensive places to live in North Carolina, she's a stay at home mom who can afford a cushy lifestyle, and thus, thinks that everyone else should be able to do what she does.She once told a reader of her website to sell their car so they could afford clean eating. This person lived in the rural Midwest, where having a car to go anywhere was a necessity.These recipes are good - doable - if you have the time. But time is a thing that people like Lisa and \"Food Babe\", her partner in crime, don't realize most people don't have. The recipes in this book are not feasible for a lower middle class or impoverished family, or a single-family household.Mrs. Leake thinks she is doing some good, and while she might be, for the people who can afford it and have the time, it leaves the rest of us, the people who should \"sell their cars\", still resorting to eating convenience foods.Budget Bytes is a far better alternative, if you're poorer and want to eat healthy."}, {"userName": "Carissa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3434930-carissa", "userReview": "I have such mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, I agreed with the author's food philosophy. Processed foods are bad, bad, bad. I, like the author, read Pollan's book, In Defense of Food and agreed with it. Some of the advice the author gave was helpful and I was motivated to eat better.Buuuuuuuut, there was a lot in this book that I couldn't relate to. The author made such a sweeping and dramatic change in her diet and props to her. However, her reaction to In Defense of Food was so opposite to my own, that I had a hard time understanding this author. (I'm more of a slow, small changes person.) Even her 12 week challenge was too much for me. Rather than holding my hand through this whole foods life style change, I felt like she was pushing me off a food cliff. Also, at times, the author came off as a bit self-righteous. While I agreed with the author's beliefs about the virtues of organic foods and local, humanely treated meat, I found her eating habits completely unrealistic to my life. The entire time I read this book, I kept thinking, \"Too expensive. Too expensive! Too expensive!!!\" Sure enough, when the author gave her \"frugal\" budget for four people, I laughed. It was a whopping $50 A WEEK more than my budget for four people.I also felt like too much of this book was a review of Pollan's book. I wish the author would have brought more of her own ideas to the table. For instance, she could have focused more on application and given baby steps to those of us who aren't quite ready to so drastically change our eating habits. I would have loved a section about how to incorporate more veggies into one's diet.On the bright side, this book was beautiful, with gorgeous pictures of the author and her family and pictures of food, scattered throughout. Visually, it was stunning. I also loved that the author included quotes from her children. It was so cute and sweet. I had mixed reviews on the recipes. Her dinner recipes didn't quite gel with my family. We tried the eggplant Parmesan and the potato soup. The eggplant Parmesan was a little too simple for my family's tastes. The potato soup was good but didn't taste any different from potato soups that I've made in the past. What I really loved about the cookbook were the breakfast, lunch, and snack recipes. I'm always looking for lunch and snack time ideas in particular. We made the cinnamon apple chips and LOVED them. They were a very doable, healthy treat. We will definitely be making them again! The breakfast and lunch sections had lots of great-looking recipes. However, we only had time to make the black bean tostadas before I needed to return the book to the library. We loved the tostadas. I will definitely be adding them to our lunch rotation. They would also make a great quick dinner for our busy nights.Overall, this was a decent book (especially for people who don't have time to read In Defense of Food), with some good recipes. 3 Stars."}, {"userName": "Jamie Puleo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4753047-jamie-puleo", "userReview": "I've followed Lisa Leake on Facebook for some time which is why I wanted to check out this book. After reading, I can say that it was a worthwhile read, and the recipes are a great introduction to simple, clean eating. Her family has definitely gone to the most strict sense of clean eating, and that isn't for everyone, including me, but it definitely makes you think about what clean eating means and how even small changes such as reading labels can make a huge difference. It is amazing to see what is being put in our food even when it is being pushed as \"healthy.\"  A lot of the complaints about this book were how eating clean isn't cost effective and that Leake comes across as pretentious. Leake very clearly states that it won't work for every family, but she does give the tools for those who really do want to go \"all in.\" She also stresses that any change is better than no change. She is definitely opinionated about clean eating, but it's her passion. I'm not going to overhaul my family's eating habits, but I did take away some good information from the book and will make some positive changes. As far as complaints about cost, it's just an easy excuse to not like the book or Leake's lifestyle. Does it cost more? Sure. Cost of produce, meat, and other healthy foods always have cost more. This isn't her fault.  Overall, this was a worthwhile read with an interesting point of view. I'm not going to become a full convert, but I am taking away some great information and recipe ideas."}, {"userName": "Stacey Sapper", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21229562-stacey-sapper", "userReview": "The healthy eating sections in the beginning of the book are interesting.

The 2nd half is recipes.I follow the blog and agree with some of the other comments; Lisa can come off as pretentious because she is very passionate about her beliefs. There is nothing wrong with that, but it can rub some people the wrong way. She is also a stay-at-home mom with what appears to be a very comfortable financial situation -- something that allows her to do things that a lot of people won't be able to follow.Pros: --she has a lot of good, if common, information. --She has a LOT of kid-friendly recipes (which I don't have to worry about, but I know many people who are constantly trying to find food that their kids will eat). --EVERY recipe has a picture -- this is HUGE for me since i am not the best of cooks and the pictures help to know what I'm trying to accomplish.--The recipes that I have tried are very tasty and easy to follow.Cons: There is absolutely no nutrition information. Lisa addresses this in that she herself does not have a weight problem and just wants people to focus on the 'real' food. For someone who DOES have a weight-problem I find this to be a big draw-back of the cookbook. It is not promoted as a weight-loss book, but nutrition information is considered standard in today's world so I find this to be a disservice to the public by not including that information.Thanks to Brianne's review for putting me onto Budget Bytes website; I am now a follower. I like how that blog breaks down the cost of things and you can easily incorporate some of 100 Day's philosophy's into the recipes to come up with healthy yet budget-friendly recipes."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17759018-elizabeth", "userReview": "A couple years ago I started following 100 Days of Real Food on Facebook. It was an easy way to see lunch ideas and get some great recipes for our family. I visit their blog occasionally and have pulled some of our favorite recipes from their (the creamy wheat macaroni and cheese is a favorite of my husband's!).I was thrilled when I heard about their cookbook. And even more excited when they offered me a copy in order to review it! 100 Days of Real Food by Lisa Leake is more like a Bible for food and healthy eating. The recipes are divine, yet family friendly and easy to make. The pictures are gorgeous (you know I love a cookbook with photos!). The lunch box ideas are fantastic, and there are several pages of ideas. Perfect for any lunch, really, not just one away from home! But it's not just recipes. The first half of the book is about the Leake's own food journey and how to get started on your own road to real food. From \"What is Real Food?\" to \"Making Changes; Don't Overthink, Just Start!\" There are menu plans based on seasons, what to watch for in food labels, how to shop, snack ideas, and so much more. As a busy mom, with limited time in the kitchen, this is the book on how to change our diet while not having anyone rebel at mealtimes! I am thrilled to add this to my bookshelf and see myself using it time and time again. Perfect for all degrees of cooks, the recipes even list the difficulty from easy to advanced."}, {"userName": "Kelli", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146551-kelli", "userReview": "I am (admittedly) more than a little obsessed with food...or perhaps terrified by food would be more accurate. What I read on a weekly basis keeps me up at night, and I can't for the life of me understand how these additives and poisons are legally put into our food. There are many books about food that I'm not yet brave enough to read, though I am very well-versed in and try to abide by the whole/local/certain things organic lifestyle. This book is part cookbook, part back story and part tips, hints and techniques for variety and success. I love the idea of this book and found it to be an easy, enjoyable read. I'm not familiar with the blog but I applaud the author for what she has accomplished both in this MAJOR life change to real food and in her presentation of it in this book. She seems to truly want to help others move over to a lifestyle of eating whole foods and her offering is neither preachy nor judgmental. For me, the recipes were very basic but for anyone who is eating primarily processed, packaged foods, the recipes would be great. Regardless, I give this book high marks.

I really try to prepare whole foods for my kids, but this lady takes it to a level that I don't feel like committing myself to at this time in my life. For example, if it comes from the store, it has to be 5 ingredients or less, and the word whole and organic must be present. Now, I'm a label reader big time. I look for sugar content, artificial ingredients, fat, sodium, etc...Part of my degree is in nutrition, but I feel like there is a misconception of ingredients labeled as \"bad\" that really aren't that bad...maybe I haven't been truly converted yet. What I did love were the recipes, they are delicious, and I love the lunch section for kids lunch...I was all inspired to change my lunch prep ways, then realized that the food she puts in her small kids lunch won't work for high school and middle school.

I'll still use real sugar though...too bad it's got such a bad rep."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/797950-emily", "userReview": "I would say I identify with the \"real food\" philosophy of eating more than any other diet trend these days. I read In Defense of Food (like Leake did) and it completely changed my views just like it did hers (although I didn't change my life as drastically as she did). So I agree with a lot of the things she says in the book. I personally liked the ratio of content/recipes in the book, although some might be disappointed if they were looking for more of a cookbook, or more of a nonfiction read. I think it's about half and half (I read the ebook so I don't know for sure). Yes, there are 100 recipes, but keep in mind that many of them are not entree recipes; you couldn't go your whole life eating only recipes from this book. Also, she's not a journalist, scientist, or researcher, so she doesn't have her own research to back up her claims. If you want the research, read Pollan himself. I also recommend Just Food, which proves some of the common real-food points (such as those about GMOs) wrong, or at least much more complicated than real-food-ists believe they are. However, Leake's book is much more readable and a great introduction to the real-food way of life. A little ways through this book, I decided to check out Leake's blog and her original blog posts about her 100 Days of Real Food challenge. Whoa...I don't recommend this. If you think Leake is pretentious in this book, you really won't like her blog! She complains about how other people are so unwilling to make changes in their lives. Yeah, well, not everyone has the time, energy, and passion to devote to a major life change. She thinks that just because she is passionate about this issue, everyone else should be--and if they aren't, they either don't have the facts or they're lazy. The truth is, sometimes we know what the best way is to do things, but we simply don't have the passion to completely devote our lives to it the way Leake did. She spent hours upon hours preparing food for her family and researching restaurants to see what they would serve that her family could eat. She and her husband would send food back at restaurants multiple times and ask their servers 500 questions every time they went out. She put so much stress into her life over this challenge; she lost sleep over whether her daughter would eat candy backstage at her dance recital. Here's a story she shared on her blog that truly shocked me: She went to visit her parents (whose reluctance to go real-food she complains about frequently) with her kids. Her parents very kindly went out of their way to cook an entire real-food meal for her family, including locally raised meat. Leake took one bite of the pasta and questioned whether it was whole-wheat or not. Her parents assured her that it was. Leake proceeded to dig through their trash to find the pasta box, and sure enough--the box said \"whole wheat blend,\" which meant it wasn't 100% whole wheat. Gasp! So, Leake and her children would not eat another bite of the meal her parents had made for them, and Leake went into the kitchen to prepare a whole different meal for them. The level of insanity in this behavior is just unbelievable to me. It's great to be committed to something, but at what expense? I think Michael Pollan himself would find this story appalling. Okay, sorry, this is supposed to be a review of the BOOK, not the blog. I would still recommend the book because Leake has calmed down considerably since that first challenge, it appears. She says that she and her family make a lot more exceptions to the real-food rules now that their 100 Days challenge is over, and she also encourages readers to make just the changes that are reasonable for them. She still comes across a little pretentious, but I can certainly handle it better in the book than I could on her blog. (Also, I'm guessing her more recent blog posts are more similar to the book, and she probably has some great recipes on there. Just don't read her original 100 Days challenge posts.) I think I have to give the book 4 stars rather than 3 because it really did get me excited about eating real food more than I do. I checked the labels on some of the foods I buy and was really surprised. I want to start making more food from scratch and eating less refined sugar and flour, for sure. For someone like me who was already converted to the idea of eating real food, the book was great inspiration. There's one thing I think Lisa Leake really misses the boat on when it comes to real food (something that, if I remember correctly, is actually discussed quite a bit in In Defense of Food and French Kids Eat Everything, two books that Leake loves): food is not just about food. The cultures that have the best relationships with food are the ones that use food to bring people together, not force them apart. Making judgments about other people based on what they eat and acting superior to others because you eat more real food than you do are not helpful. Even simply adhering so strictly to a real-food diet that you convince other people that they could NEVER eat real food the way you do is actually taking our society a step backward rather than forward. Part of eating real food is learning to truly love food and having many more positive experiences with it than negative ones. I think it's important to be relaxed about food \"rules\" not just because it's hard to be strict, but also because you would otherwise lose out on wonderful opportunities to share and enjoy food with others who may not share your philosophy. I wish that Leake would have brought that point of view into her book."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17617176-katie", "userReview": "Really beautiful book with photos for every recipe.
