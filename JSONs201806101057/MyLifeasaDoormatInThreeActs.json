I know this sounds extremely dorky, but it's the true story and it's why I jioned this website, to tell people about the books they know nothing aboutand I know plenty about. So, anyway, I was looking in the library for a subject that I, at least, would enjoy. And of course that meant..........acting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I looked in the young adults section to find something about acting and that was at my age level, and just as I entered the isle, it jumped out at me. My Life as a Doormat(IN THREE ACTS)those three words just told me that was the book I was looking for. It also had that look to it as if it was about somebody who wanted to complain about their life through a character they thought fit the tale perfectly. That's exactly what I would have done for my first few books if I were an author. It improved my writing page by page listening to this women tell me her exceedingly embarrassing life. I started to write poems about things I had never experienced or felt in my life and people thought they couldn't have written it better, they also said one more thing, each and every one of them, how can you write so well and so much about something or someone you know so little about. I had finally put my creativity and writing passion to good use. I admire the author of this book so much I really sugest you read it. It's funny, it's sad, it's surprising, and just a tiny bit cliche, but that's , that's what made it for me,that's what gave me my ability to express myself in the only passionate, incredible, amazing, craziest way ever. Writing. My name name is Natalie Cidon and I write poems, but only because of this fantastic book."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/857881-sandy", "userReview": "The character was annoying and I wanted to throttle her. I liked the storyline but she was really just getting on my nerves. I mean how dumb can she be and let her boyfriend treat her that way. There were moments that I wanted to stop reading the book because she was really getting to me but then I realized that there are still girls that are just like her. Also I realize that was what the book was all about since the title is life as a doormat but she was just extreme. It's hard for me to rate this book because I liked the storyline and I liked Cinco but I really didn't like her so I will give it a 2 1/2."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3488910-kelly", "userReview": "I have to say I really liked this library find. I was more than frustrated with the main character at times, but I suppose that was the point.

This is just one of the reasons why her novels are so enjoyable. Her writing doesn't depend on graphic sex, violence or language to advance the story. As I get to know the characters better, I want to know more about what happens to them. In \"My Life as a Doormat\" Leah Townsend has a predictable life with a predictable (read boring) boyfriend and together their predictable relationship has no surprises. When Leah shows up at a conflict resolution group that she thinks her boyfriend signed them both up for, she is shocked to find out that he expected her to attend by herself. If you think being safe is the best you can hope for in life, join Leah to find out what can happen when you learn how to say no."}, {"userName": "Merwinna Stevens", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38664297-merwinna-stevens", "userReview": "A Book Worth Reading More Than OnceThis is a beautiful story full of life, romance and humor. It is a powerful story about relationships. The love and character of God is evident in some of the characters. It makes one look inward to examine where one lines up related to the love-walk.

Since then, her writing -- and her relationship with her ever-dependable boyfriend, Edward -- has gone downhill. She can't seem to recapture the \"magic\" that made her first play a success, and as far the relationship goes, well -- suddenly Leah finds herself wanting more out of life (she's just not sure exactly what \"more\" means -- and if \"more\" involves conflict, well forget about it). When Edward interprets her desire for change as an inability to cope with conflict, Leah finds herself enrolled in a conflict management class with Cinco Dublin, a man who's everything she's not...and to whom she finds herself increasingly attracted. Much like Tamara Leigh's Stealing Adda, Gutteridge provides her readers with a fascinating (and often humorous) glimpse into the life and career of a writer -- dealing with agents, writer's block, and self doubt -- and of course there's the inevitable romantic entanglement. There's even hilarious input from Jodie Bellarusa, the main character in Leah's work-in-progress. Leah's voice is fresh, funny, and oh-so-honest. In Leah, Gutteridge has crafted an incredibly hilarious, relatable, very real heroine. Leah's transformation from a pushover and a doormat to outspoken self-assurance is both incredibly entertaining and inspiring. This is the perfect summer read -- light and engrossing, with characters so real they'll stay with you long after you close the novel. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Kristin (Kritters Ramblings)", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3742733-kristin-kritters-ramblings", "userReview": "Ehhh it was ok. I hate to start a review like this, but I was left with a semi ok feeling. Nothing was super wrong with it. I guess my main area of concern was the main character - I found her to be super whiny and beyond believable. It took her way to long to discover that a changed needed to happen in her relationships and decision making.BUT I loved the premise of the story - the sibling of the prodigal son and learning how to cope with not being the star child in the family. At times I felt a few commonalities between me and Leah - we were both the children of the family that followed the rules to a T and rarely bucked the rules our parents laid down. The big lesson comes when the sibling becomes the child that is in the forefront. Although this hasn't happened in our family, J and I have taken turns needing our parents attention for good and bad reasons.Now after some negative comments, I would definitely pass this book along to the women in my life, but I would preface it that they should be read on the beach or huddled in during a quiet vacation. This isn't one of those \"smart\" reads."}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6034789-april", "userReview": "This was a pretty fun book, even though it was definitely light reading. I will admit, though, that I got annoyed (a lot!) by the protagonist, Leah, for being such a doormat! It was almost painful to read at times. But at the same time, I liked seeing her growth throughout the book, although admittedly the majority of her personal growth occurred in the last 40 pages or so.Honestly, Leah was likable, aside from her doormat-ness. Cinco was probably my favorite character, though, just because he is Leah's opposite. Edward was definitely my least favorite character (which is odd considering I didn't really care for Leah's parents that much); I can attest that although his character may have been exaggerated a little bit, there are guys like that out there (love -- and need -- routines, very science- and detail-oriented; almost Asperger-ish actually). I guess he was a bit of a stereotype though.If you're looking for a quick, light read, then I'd recommend this. Definitely not a masterpiece, but it's enjoyable, and there are some characters in the book that are likable."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7958059-amy", "userReview": "This was a great book! I really enjoyed it. Admittedly about halfway through I almost didn't finish it because the author did such a great job of making Leah feel uncomfortable in confrontational situations that it actually made me anxious! Seriously I kid you not, I almost couldn't finish. But I think that says old great deal about the authors talent and making the characters relatable and real. I really liked hearing about the family and the dynamics in that family as well as about the dynamics in the therapy group. Situations brought up in the plot for not only unique but also funny. This was a great book and it makes you want to go back and find other books by this author. I highly recommend this book but I would think that those who are non-confrontational should be aware that you might find yourself vicariously anxious when reading some of the scenes. I wouldn't let that turn you off though because if I can get through it so can you!"}, {"userName": "Kelci", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10907549-kelci", "userReview": "Beautiful. Inspiring. And hilarious! To find a book like this makes reading all those mediocre and sometimes down right boring books worth it. I was trying to think of a reason to give it one less star but it deserves every one of them. The characters leaped off the page, the writing was a joy to read, and the story was both thought provoking and laugh out loud funny. There wasn't a moment that I felt preached at, which for those of us who consume lots of Christian fiction know, is beyond rare. Whenever God is mentioned it's in a real, honest way, and runs smoothly with the story instead of feeling forced in like a splinter to make you cringe.A beautiful story, light yet engaging, with an amazing message with many unexpected twists and laughs. What a joy to read!"}, {"userName": "Yolie Gachelin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16623216-yolie-gachelin", "userReview": "You know you are an advent reader when you go to the library and pick out a book not because of the title, not because of the author, not because of the book cover, but because you just randomly went down that isle and picked up the book to read. That is what I did with this book. And the funny thing to me is that this book is like that. While reading this book, to me it didn't fall under any real gene. It didn't really have a beginning middle end. It did have a climax and a resolution. But the book was a book for someone to read. With no purpose no great desire, but just to read.

I can relate to that -- if there's a conflict, I'm sooo out of there -- and I really appreciated the character growth. On a side note, if you've ever done the personality study on whether you are a choloric/leader; meloncholy/perfect; phlematic/peaceful; ??/popular, this main character is definately a meloncholy perfect (Sunday School class just had a month long session on this, and this book fit into the study almost perfectly).

I couldn't get into it, when normally I'm hooked by Rene's books from the first line. The main character, Leah, drove me nuts - I couldn't stand her and how much of a doormat she was. There was no flow between chapters. At the end of a chapter something happens, but then it doesn't flow on to the next. You eventually find out what it was, but I always got the sense that I was missing something from the story. At least at the end of the book Leah stops being a doormat."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/703972-becky", "userReview": "A woman who works hard at maintaining harmony shouldn't have so many conflicts. Leah Townsend reminds me of myself in quite a few ways. I really enjoyed the characters in this story, although I wish there was more development of a couple of the male personalities.
