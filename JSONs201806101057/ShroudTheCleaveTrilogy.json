I recently read his The Untouchable about a British spy in the Cold War who is secretly gay.In this book we have an academic scholar, a specialist on Nietzsche. He\u2019s an old man, recently widowed. He\u2019s in ill health and he has secrets. This late in life, a young woman has discovered some? all? of his secrets and threatens to expose him. He agrees to fly from California to Turin to meet with her. He wonders: does it even matter at this point if his secrets are exposed? Supposedly he grew up in Belgium during WW II. There are hints of his family being carried away in trucks when he was a youth. Although we don\u2019t know at the time if this is his real background or his made-up one. You can\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t warn us: \u201cAll this I remembered, even though it never happened.\u201dHe\u2019s a misogynist and downright rude to waiters, hotel people and colleagues. He\u2019s rude to the young woman as well especially since she has seizures and he considers her crazy. Of course they have an affair and maybe even fall in love. He\u2019s a self-admitted fraud in terms of his academic expertise: \u201cI could discourse with convincing familiarity on texts I had not got round to reading, philosophies I had not yet studied, great men I had never met.\u201d Like Calvino and others, he rails against the pomposity of academic proceedings with phrases like honeyed bitterness; elegantly humorous conceits; sphere of precocities and trivial arcana. Other passages I liked: \u201cBody: that was a word she did not like, the sound of it, the bubbled b, the d\u2019s soft thud, the nasal, whining y.\u201d\u201cAmerica was emptiness. In my image of it the country had no people anywhere, only great, stark, silent buildings, and gleaming machinery, and endless, desolate spaces. Even the name seemed a nonce-word, or an unsolvable anagram, with too many vowels in it.\u201d \u201cHow would one detect the encroachment of senility, when what is being attacked is the very faculty of detection itself?\u201dOf his late wife: \u201cOnly in death has she begun to live fully, for me\u2026My life with her was a special way of being alone. It was like living on intimate terms with a creature from another species; she was to me as remote and inaccessible as some large, harmless herbivore.\u201dA lot of people are dying in this novel: he\u2019s old and ill and his colleagues and old flames are old. The title is a play on the Shroud that is kept in Turin, and Turin was also home for a while to Nietzsche. It a very dense work structured in page-long paragraphs without any dialog. A good read but I still prefer his The Sea and the Untouchable. photo of Turin from booking.com/city/itphoto of Shroud from dailymail.co.uk"}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "Banville keeps playing with words and intention. He teases and probes, mocks and beguiles, baffles and enlightens with his darkly pleasant wordplay. A pattern of recurrent symbols drenched with double entendres, the deliberate use of anagrams, of menacing coincidences, of literary connections. What is fiction and what is reality? Nietzsche affirms that \u201cthere exists neither \u201cspirit\u201d, nor reason, nor thinking, nor consciousness, nor soul, nor will, nor truth: all are fictions.\u201dWhat is hallucination and what is remembrance? Banville is of the opinion that\u201cwhat is remarkable is not that we remember, but that we forget\u201d.Banville shrouds his story in mystery and drags the reader through the nooks and crannies of his antihero\u2019s mind, the highly acclaimed literary critic Axel Vander who is also an irascible old man, recently widowed and haunted by the ghost of his docile wife, who bears the cross of a fraudulent identity and a diffused past in the Antwerp of WWII. Threatened by a letter from an enigmatic woman called Cassandra Cleave, an uncommon femme fatale, that reveals secrets that would disrupt Axel\u2019s staged life, he leaves the comfortable impersonality of Arcady, the rural paradise of California, to meet her in Turin. Once again, the Irish artist paints his characters using the sfumato technique, wrapping them in a sort of haze that blurs the contours of their figures. The unreliable narration shifts from Axel\u2019s first person narrative to Cass\u2019 third person without warning and in both cases, the more the characters explore their psyches, their pasts and their memories, the more undefined they become. Reflection and identity serve as settings where the \u201cnon-action\u201d gradually unfolds.This novel is part of a trilogy, and so it is no accident that the actor Alexander Cleave, protagonist of the sequel Ancient Light who is also Cassandra\u2019s father, and the writer Axel Vander, Alex and Axel, are both impostors who lie with eloquence and without the slightest shred of shame about their pasts. Their monologues, almost soliloquies with Shakespearean ascendancy, dissolve the distinctness of their features in the askew labyrinth of their consciences, leaving only an indistinct shade of their separate beings in the mirror of Banville\u2019s prose.It is not fortuitous either that the downfall of the nihilistic protagonist takes place in Turin, where the mad philosopher lost his last vestiges of sanity, or that Axel\u2019s first essay was about Shelley who drowned his poetry in the surly ocean in the Gulf of La Spezia. Every intellectual reference or choice of expression is intentional and contributes into creating a dazzling masquerade ball where the reader swirls and the characters dance to the rhythm of Banville\u2019s elastic, atemporal narration, making of fallacious simulation an artistic genre on its own.But Banville\u2019s genius doesn\u2019t stop there. The pregnant imagery and plot twists are not the most fundamental aspects of his novels. It is the superb portrayal of such a disturbing emotional landscape that reveals the true \u201cbeauty of the monster\u201d, of the irredeemable villain, Harlequin and Prince at once, that provides a voice for those who vacillate between life and death, light and shadow, fear and cynicism, and possesses the exceptional quality of awakening tenderness for the loathsome hero who is incapable of loving someone else, for he can only love himself in nauseating self-disgust.Nevertheless, once the dead have found their voice, not even the Holy Shroud of Turin can save them from being crucified in performance, they are beyond redemption because, as Macbeth envisioned, \u201clife\u2019s but a walking shadow, a poor placer that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more\u201d. So yes, maybe Nietzsche and Axel Vander were right and there is no God, but there will always be Shakespeare\u2026 and Banville."}, {"userName": "BlackOxford", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford", "userReview": "Proper NamesThe smoothest prose in the business. One does not so much read Banville as float luxuriously in his velvet sentences. And he shows himself in Shroud as a master at the slow reveal. It's like hearing Bolero or Nina Simone in Little Girl Blue, ever so gradually approaching a climax that you do and don't want to arrive. Every detail and slight reversal coming at just the right moment so the beat is never missed even as it becomes more forceful and impulsive. A story of the complex, long-term effects of survivor-guilt. A man tries to escape his identity and finds it in a woman who has no knowable identity at all, but is merely a collection of historical anecdotes.

This was one of the longlisted books that missed the cut. It is also the second part of a trilogy that includes Eclipse and Ancient Light, which are both books I have read, but too long ago to remember clearly.This one is a complex story full of allusions, and I suspect I missed many of them. Most of the book is narrated by \"Axel Vander\", an elderly widowed academic who was born in Belgium and has spent most of his life working in America. He travels to Turin, where he meets and falls in love with Cass Cleave, a much younger Irish woman who has been researching his life and work. His past is shrouded in secrecy - Axel Vander was actually the name of the narrator's dead friend, and he assumed it as part of his escape plan when his family were arrested by the Nazis. From time to time the focus shifts to Cass's perspective, and these sections are told in the third person.As always Banville's writing is fluent, but he does use a lot of obscure words (the most memorable of which is pococurantish), and his paragraphs can be very long, so it is a book that demands concentration, but it is ultimately quite a rewarding read and it does have plenty of lighter moments, even as it builds towards a tragic conclusion."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "Senility, the sickness of old age that most have yet to worry about, and yet those who do need to worry, avoid it like the plague it is. I can't relate to Axel Vander's age and celebrity, nor can I relate to his place of childhood, and yet I was lured by this exquisite story that seemingly drags along in lengthy paragraphs and conscious thought, with Proustian references to Swann's Way and memory. I don't even like Vander, still he manages to keep me intrigued; in fact at some point, I even find both he and his indomitable cane humorous. He is a man \"thrown together by a legion of selves,\" a man who has led a double life which started with his quest for survival.\nI desired to escape my own individuality, the hereness of my self, not the thereness of my world, the world of my lost, poor people\u2026I can scarcely remember what it was like to be the one that I once was\u2026I pause in uncertainty, losing my way in this welter of personal, impersonal, impersonating, pronouns.\nVander, a Holocaust orphan who is saved by a mysterious note, is linked to four women: Cassandra Cleave, his wife Magda, Lady Laura, and Kristina Kovacs. I liked the former less, the latter three I found intriguing. Cassandra Cleave is unhinged and unreachable and so in need of love and attention, that she is willing to cast her love to a man old enough to be her father--or, oddly enough, because she views him as her father. Cass is so intellectually inclined, she is one step away from being a scholar, if only she didn't have an ailing mind: \"she was one of those creatures who exist on a median plane between the inanimate and the super-animate, between clay and angels.\" Lady Laura is Vander's rich, former lover during his younger days, the woman much like Vander, and who is responsible for his stiff leg and one eye. Kristina Kovacs is the woman who Vander possibly loved; his one-night stand who was too much of his intellectual equal, and possibly because of this, never his significant other. I preferred Vander to Cleave not only because he is a Holocaust survivor who'd spent most of his life pretending that he wasn't Jewish, but because he is also a self-aware scoundrel. He uses everyone with whom he comes into contact; he is unapologetic and ruthless. Vander is the bad guy in your favorite thriller movie, the one whose actions you don't side with, yet become addicted to watching (think Denzel Washington in Training Day). \nThe past, my own past, the past of all the others, is still there, a secret chamber inside me, like one of those sealed rooms, behind a false wall, where a whole family might live in hiding for years. In the silence, in solitude, I close my eyes and hear them in there, the mouse-scuffles of the little ones, the grown-ups' murmurings, their sighs.\nBanville seems to have his niche: a blend of past and present intermingled with thought, themes embedded in memory, and elegant prose. Whenever I seek an author who can give me words uniquely wound in a lyrical waltz, I know I can look to Banville, especially when time constraints and convoluted work readings set my mind ablaze. His sentence structures are cooling streams for the mind, and even his titles are symbolic: the Shroud of the Crucifixion; the shroud who is Axel Vander. I only wish I'd read this before reading Ancient Light, so I could have had this backstory of Cass Cleave, this daughter of the infamous protagonist in Ancient Light."}, {"userName": "Violet wells", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196681-violet-wells", "userReview": "Often a writer will express with sculptured eloquence an idea or an impression one has had oneself but never clearly formulated. Twice, early on, Banville did the opposite. He took an idea and an impression I have and got it completely wrong! This is a descriptive passage of a night-time train journey across Europe - \u201cThe train kept stopping at deserted stations and would stand for long minutes, creaking and sighing in the night-deep, desolate silence.\u201d Desolate? No! I often get the Paris to Florence night train and the silence when the train stops at stations in the middle of the night is anything but desolate; it\u2019s like the silence that arrives after a fresh covering of snow when you have the illusive impression that all can be begun again from scratch. Then he compares hotels to hospitals. No! Hospitals are scary; hotels are exciting! This is a tough one. I really should have enjoyed this \u2013 it\u2019s set in Italy and it\u2019s written by a novelist who treats sentence writing as an artistic discipline in itself. And yet I was often bored by it and couldn\u2019t help feeling that he was striving so hard to be Nabokov that at times it read like fan fiction. It\u2019s a clever novel but it\u2019s also a bit crass \u2013 it was obvious from the start we were going to get a kind of Scrooge like redemption tale. Was the (Turin) shroud a clever stroke as a metaphor for an inward truth making an outward appearance or was that a bit crass too? Was it clever or was it crass to call the female keeper of Vander\u2019s secret Cassandra?  \u201cBanville's protagonist, and the narrator of most of the book, is Axel Vander, a European intellectual with an international reputation. Vander has achieved eminence by reading texts against their grain and rubbing people up the wrong way. He has spent his time 'trying to drum into those who would listen among the general mob of resistant sentimentalists surrounding me the simple lesson that there is no self.\u201dI especially struggled with the first half of this novel. The unrelenting melodramatic interior life of both characters was exhausting, as if they both continually ingested huge amounts of peyote to sustain their ongoing relationship with external life. Ideas of identity, selfhood play a big part in the novel\u2019s central charge but, like almost everything else in this novel, were often unfurled in exaggerated and blustering forms. Vander is possibly one of the most wilfully obnoxious characters in literature (and I suppose Banville deserves some credit for this achievement). Problem for me was that there was too much strain and panting in Banville\u2019s stylised prose and as a result rarely did Vander seem credible in his monstrous lack of generosity; rarely did Cassandra seem credible in her bottomless misery. Also it just went on too long. The first two hundred pages are essentially given over to creating Vander\u2019s character which involved a relentless fusillade of showing us just how obnoxious he is. Banville was clearly enjoying himself and probably got carried away.  The novel all hinges on Vander\u2019s wartime secret. Without giving away what the secret is I didn\u2019t really buy the supposedly massive import of this secret. Vander was a Jew in occupied Belgium. In the circumstances who\u2019s going to blame him for telling fibs to elude capture? I enjoyed the war section much more because the tension and tragedy of war was much better able to sustain the high melodrama of Banville\u2019s stylised prose. I also enjoyed the Shelley motif \u2013 the wide-eyed idealism of Shelley the polar opposite of Vander\u2019s caustic misanthropy. Ultimately Cassandra will align herself to Shelley. It\u2019s a dangerous game trying to write a Nabokovian novel. So often I was reminded while reading this how infinitely better were Pale Fire and Pnin. Quite possibly it would have been a much better novel had it been shorn of about 100 pages. I remember The Sea being a better novel though."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "[ whose identity he would later steal  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa", "userReview": "While I think I enjoyed this book more than the only other Banville I've read so far, Eclipse, and I recognize its merits, as I did with Eclipse, I still can't say I really like it (4 stars) as opposed to just liking it.

Much of the novel tells the story of their troubled love affair in Turin, ending with the events described in the final pages of Eclipse.

I read \"Ancient Light\" a while ago and although the characters' names from \"Shroud\" seemed somehow familiar, I thought that it was just my memory playing tricks on me. I was amazed to find out that Cass Cleave here is the daughter of the main character from \"Ancient Light\" and that Axel Vander is the Axel Vander from \"Ancient Light\". However, it does not matter much: the story there doesn't influence much the story here and although reading about Cass Cleave here is like understanding somehow the mystery of the Cass Cleave's story narrated there, reading this novel is experiencing a whole new world than the one created in \"Ancient Light\".The main character from this story seems to be a highly abominable person. He is certainly not a character that is popular among readers, but rather the opposite. He has however a sad history and his lies are somehow motivated by his history. His story is the story of one of the few Jews that are scarred by the Nazi, but manages to somehow escape and while struggling to survive, he commits the deeds of a common delinquent and he seems to be transformed in the very image of a monster, both his inner side and his outer side developing such an ugliness that he ends up terrifying people around him. However, like most people, he is just a refuge of innumerable and contradictory selves. He commits one of the most abominable sin: he steals from the person who helps him most to survive and he is physically scarred forever for this act and has to live with this print of the past on his body for the rest of his life. He doesn't do this out of lowness of character, but because he wants to fulfill a dream (or is it to escape and forget the awful fate of his people?): he wants to go to Arcady (America), which in his mind is the place where he would be able to be \"pure existence\", \"an affectless point moving through time, nihilism's silver bullet, penetrating clean through every obstacle, shooting holes in the flanks of every moth-eaten monument of so-called civilization.\" In other words, he wants to start over in a land where the history of his people doesn't hinder him to do so. Axel Vander is one of his friends, a person who, with the raise of the Nazi, starts to show him bit by bit his lowness of character. I don't think that taking his identity after his death is such an awful fact as the author sees here. From the list of his deeds, this would be the least negative one, in my opinion.We all are, Banville says, like a plane which is able to \"hold on to the engines\". We are the planes and our minds are the jet engines trying to speed away from them. We are however held together. Cass Cleave who has a mental disease is however barely held together. \"The slightest jolt might make her fly apart into a million pieces. Everything was like that, the particles all fused together and trying to pull asunder. One instant of imbalance...and it will all explode.\" The story here seems to be the same: made of stories fused together which at times seem to lack focus. And this makes me wonder: what do I appreciate most in a book, the story or the style? The story here has shortcomings and it seems unfocused. But the writing! The writing is a delight, every line cast a spell on me. I loved this book: its style is so lyrical, the words seem like woven with grace, with delicacy, with the talent of an artist. This is yet another confirmation of how great a writer Banville is! So, it seems I have my answer: the story might be common...the writing however conquers souls...or at least my soul.Banville should be better known and appraised at a worldwide scale: he is one of the best contemporary writers Europe has!"}, {"userName": "Nora Barnacle", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9162933-nora-barnacle", "userReview": "\u0160ta ti je ovo trebalo, mili moj Banvile?Da mi ve\u0107 dva puta nije pokazao da je stilski otmen, pametan i odmeren, popljuvala bi ga na pasja kola, crnje nego Makjuana onomad.

Vander is a real cad; boozer, womanizer and vain beyond belief but he has a secret. Yet under Banville\u2019s skillful words, my disgust for Vander turns as the tale unravels. But so are his characters, all who are flawed but so very interesting as well.All three books operate like separate stories but are very much intertwined. Having said this, once you read Eclipse, one needs to read Shroud and both books make more sense of Ancient Light, which I read first and is the last of the so-called trilogy.Sadly one can\u2019t say much without revealing too much about Shroud. Believe me, there is a pack-full story line here and the book is a page turner. Like Shroud, the words are evocative, mesmerizing and wondrous. A master storyteller that can\u2019t be missed.Weirdly, there is an eclipse in Shroud, an reference to ancient light in both Eclipse and Shroud, and the shroud is the famous Shroud of Turin.

He\u2019s not a well-known author, and unfortunately, I doubt that he\u2019ll ever be on the top of the bestseller list (unless as Benjamin Black), though he certainly deserves to be. His books are masterpieces of style; they are highly introspective, character driven stories of men who have attempted to build lives on the basis of fraud and deceit, only to see those lives eventually come tumbling down around them like the flimsiest house of cards. In The Untouchable, Banville introduced us to the art critic and Soviet agent, Anthony Blunt. In Eclipse, it was the embittered actor, Alex Cleave. In Shroud, it\u2019s Axel Vander, virtuoso of the lie, who takes center stage, for Banville lets us know almost immediately, Axel Vander is not really Axel Vander, although Vander, himself says he is at the beginning of his tale:My name is Axel Vander, on that much I insist. That much, if no more.We first encounter Axel Vander in his home in quaint Arcady, California (a very thinly disguised Berkeley). Vander\u2019s a Belgian born intellectual, a professor and internationally known literary scholar. But, as in all of Banville\u2019s works, nothing is at it really seems, and we soon find out that Vander has much he\u2019s been hiding. As Vander says:All my life I have lied. I lied to escape, I lied to be loved, I lied for placement and power; I lied to lie.It\u2019s quite clear that Banville, who likes to base his novels on the lives of historical persons, has based the character of Axel Vander on Paul de Man, a Belgian born Yale scholar and founder of deconstrutivism. Although de Man was revered when he died in 1983, in 1987 it was discovered that as a young man in Belgium, he\u2019d written several very anti-Semitic articles for the Flemish newspaper, Le Soir. Vander\u2019s dead wife, Magda, even shares her name with de Man\u2019s wife. Vander also seems to have been drawn, to a lesser degree, from French Marxist philosopher, Louis Althusser, a man who, like de Man, was revered as a cult figure, and a man who, like Vander, murdered his own wife.Although Vander seems proud of his lies, and proud that he\u2019s gotten away with them, this decidedly misanthropic, elderly widower doesn\u2019t like himself any more than he likes others. He\u2019ll chase people away from him with his walking stick, he\u2019s almost always drunk and he describes himself as a man with:that gnarled leg, that crazily skewed dead eye, and all that sagging flesh, the pot belly and the shrunken acorn below and its bag suspended by an attenuated string of yellowed skin like the head of garlic on its stalk.Axel Vander doesn\u2019t spare others, but to his credit, he doesn\u2019t spare himself, either.The day we meet Axel, he\u2019s just received a letter from a woman in Belgium, a researcher who's stumbled upon the truth of Axel\u2019s past quite by accident and now, for reasons unknown, is threatening to unmask him. Axel is determined not to put up with any such thing, especially not so late in his life, when he has but little life left. He arranges to meet his nemesis in Turin, that northern Italian city whose claim to fame is that it is the home of the once revered Shroud of Turin, a shroud that has been shown to be as fake as is Axel Vander, himself.Vander, a Nietzsche scholar, with \"a passionate and all-consuming belief in nothing\" plans on attending a seminar on Nietzsche at the university in Turin (the city where Nietzsche had his final breakdown), and he also plans on doing away with his would-be unmasker. When Vander, who could hardly be a less sympathetic character, arrives in Turin, however, his nemesis is not who and what he thought she would be. When Vander meets Cass Cleave, a fair, fragile, red-haired Irish beauty, rather than feeling the murderous rage he was prepared to feel he felt:\u2026as if I had come face-to-face on a forest path with a rare and high-strung creature of the wild that had paused a second in quivering curiosity and would in another second be gone with a crash of leaves. I knew the type. They always sat at the highest tier of the lecture hall, fixed on me hungrily, never speaking a word unbidden.Cass Cleave, it would seem, is certainly no match for Axel Vander. In addition to being frail and fragile, she suffers from Mandelbaum\u2019s Syndrome, a syndrome that causes her to have seizures and aural hallucinations despite the fact that she\u2019s tried several different kinds of medication, all with very allusive sounding names: Oread, Empusa, various Lemures and Lamia.Shockingly, Vander and Cass embark upon an affair, and Vander says:I loved her. I have allowed I hope a decent interval for the laughter, the jeers and the catcalls to subside.In fact, Vander and Cass spend three months in Turin, making love, visiting castles and cemeteries and trying, in vain, to view the notorious shroud. As this unlikely duo makes its way around Turin, we are told most of the story in the first person, from Axel\u2019s point of view, though at times, Banville switches to the third person and gives us Cass\u2019s thoughts as well. Cass, we learn, is a woman fighting demons of her own, but just what those demons are, other than the syndrome to which she\u2019s subject, is never made completely clear. Like Axel\u2019s identity Cass\u2019s demons, as well as her motives in contacting Axel Vander, are quite opaque and misty.Axel Vander seems to be searching for \"one last chance\" in the person of Cass Cleave. He seems to see her as his redemption, and for that reason, his desire for her knows no bounds.Cass doesn\u2019t have quite the same passion for Axel, though she does feel much for him. She does, however, have a passion for death and she wishes to be:Gone like that without a sound, like slipping out of a room and turning and quietly closing the door; in her mind she saw a hand, it was hers, slowly relinquish the polished knob and her miniature, curved reflection on it shrink to a dot of darkness and disappear.Vander and Cass are, of course, both headed for tragedy on a grand scale. That\u2019s not a spoiler; that\u2019s something that\u2019s obvious from page one.As in all of John Banville\u2019s books, ghosts and specters flit through Shroud. In particular, is a red-haired man who is always following Axel Vander. Whether this man is real or is simply a product of Vander\u2019s fevered imagination is never made known, but one thing that is clear is that he is based on the red-haired man who shadowed von Aschenbach through much of Thomas Mann\u2019s gorgeous novella, Death in Venice. And Vander and Cass eventually come to be seen as something of a King Lear and a Cordelia, though on a much less grand scale. Banville loves allusions and so do I, but Shroud, I think, may suffer from a few too many. The problem is, that while Banville\u2019s languidly exquisite prose is still very much in evidence, the story, itself simply can\u2019t support all the allusions Banville heaps upon it. And Axel Vander and Cass Cleave eventually come to be seen, not as Lear and Cordelia, but as Harlequin and Columbine.I think it goes without saying that Axel Vander is a very unsympathetic figure, but Cass Cleave, despite her many problems...perhaps because of her many problems\u2026is not a sympathetic figure, either. She\u2019s barely more than a shadow, a wisp of a human being. While it\u2019s difficult to understand what would entice her to enter into a sexual relationship with someone as unsavory as Vander, it\u2019s even more of a mystery how someone so frail and fragile could endure Vander\u2019s sexual predilections. It was also not believable to me that someone like Axel Vander, who had spent his entire adult life building and maintaining a lie, would see, in the very thinly drawn Cass Cleave, a chance for redemption. Indeed, it strains credibility to even think that Axel Vander would even consider redemption to be something he should seek. The book begins wonderfully and I could see that Banville was going to explore one of his favorite themes: the uncertainty of identity and the fragility of the self, but about halfway through the book, at the point where Axel and Cass begin their love affair, all verisimilitude, for me, at least, was lost. Axel Vander committed his crimes so he could come to the United States because there he says he would not be required to be or do anything. He could be pure existence, itself. And now he is risking throwing it all away.Cass Cleave just wasn\u2019t a strong enough character to cause this kind of change in anyone, although Vander says:I seized on her to be my authenticity\u2026.She was my last chance to be me.Okay, fine. But Axel Vander has spent the last sixty years obliterating \"me. I just couldn\u2019t buy his sudden turn around simply because Cass Cleave discovered his real identity. And that brings me to yet another problem with this book.Shroud is an extremely atmospheric book, drenched in death and decay. Some of the descriptions of rain-soaked Turin are gorgeous in the extreme and the book is almost worth reading for those descriptions alone. But, Banville has filled Shroud with mystery. He\u2019s set his readers up for a huge revelation that never comes. And what little does come is pretty inconsequential, in the grand scheme of things. Certainly nothing worthy of the demons both Vander and Cass are attempting to elude.I\u2019m not sorry I read Shroud. I did thoroughly enjoy it, more than some better written books, and I am an admitted \"Banville junkie.\" I want to read everything he writes, if not for the story, then simply for the gorgeous prose. Perhaps Edna O\u2019Brien, a fellow countryman of Banville\u2019s is the only author writing today who can string words together as beautifully as does Banville.Although gorgeously written in Banville\u2019s exquisitely voluptuous prose, and to the author\u2019s credit, eschewing all sentimentality, in the end, Shroud just doesn\u2019t pull it together. Still, I would recommend it, as long as the reader knows he won\u2019t be entirely satisfied in the end."}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "I have a hard time assigning stars to this review.

Even the gracious setting of Turin (thus, the most obvious reference in the title \"Shroud\") couldn't lift the oppressive cloud of lethargy and depression that permeated this novel.

Con una escritura hipn\u00f3tica y sofisticada, en 'Imposturas', nos ofrece una historia inteligente, ingeniosa, con momentos crudos y de desesperaci\u00f3n, en la que disecciona dos mentes, las de los dos protagonistas, Alex Vander y Cass Cleave. De manera muy habilidosa, Banville crea una nueva novela d\u00e1ndonos a conocer a Cass Cleave, la hija de Alex Cleave, el protagonista de su anterior novela, 'Eclipse'; pero esto no supone que se tenga que leer necesariamente una novela antes que otra, son de lectura totalmente independiente. Es como si las dos novelas hubiesen sido escritas al mismo tiempo, y cuyos argumentos tambi\u00e9n transcurriesen paralelamente, para desembocar en un mismo final.En 'Importuras' hay dos voces narrativas. Una es la de Alex Vander, un anciano fil\u00f3sofo de origen europeo afincando en California, cuyos libros lo han hecho c\u00e9lebre. Su mal genio y acritud son habituales en \u00e9l. Un buen d\u00eda recibe una carta de una desconocida. Dice que est\u00e1 en Amberes, ciudad natal del escritor, y asegura haber descubierto su verdadera indentidad. En la carta dice que quiere encontrarse con \u00e9l, y, aprovechando una conferencia que ha de impartir en Tur\u00edn, acepta. No cabe duda de que est\u00e1 preocupado; oculta secretos que no quiere que salgan a la luz. Vander espera encontrarse a alguien que desea vengarse de \u00e9l, pero le espera una sorpresa...La otra voz narrativa del libro es la de Cass Cleave, cuyo padre (que curiosamente tambi\u00e9n se llama Alex, al igual que Vander), ya conocimos en 'Eclipse', una joven que est\u00e1 de viaje por Europa recabando informaci\u00f3n para su tesina. Es una chica compleja e inteligente, pero con problemas mentales: oye voces en su cabeza que intenta no escuchar y sufre ataques de vez en cuando. Decir que mantiene una relaci\u00f3n dif\u00edcil con su padre, es quedarse corto. Y tambi\u00e9n es una ferviente lectora de los libros de Alex Vander...Como comentaba en la rese\u00f1a de 'Eclipse', que la cr\u00edtica adora a John Banville, compar\u00e1ndolo con Navokov, Beckett o Roth. Pienso que tienen, salvando las distancias, algo de raz\u00f3n, y el personaje de Vander tiene ciertas similitudes con el Humbert Humbert de 'Lolita', en las pasiones y en ese querer huir de s\u00ed mismos.'Imposturas' es una novela que te arrastra a los oscuros abismos del alma humana, en un viaje de dolor, desesperaci\u00f3n y humanidad.\"[...] soy un ser hecho completamente de poses.

Shroud features one of the most unpleasant protagonists I have ever encountered, Axel Vander. Ugh. During Part 1 of this three-part novel, I was propelled by Banville's gorgeous prose, but in Part 2, I realized that like Victor Maskell in The Untouchable, there is more to Axel than the face he shows the world. Cold, miserable, hateful. That's Axel in Part 1. But then we see the other Axel. All is revealed through his experiences just before and during World War II and through his relationship with Cass Cleave. She was another motivation for me to read this book; she features posthumously in Ancient Light -- as does Axel Vander -- and I wanted to know more about her; the effects of Mandelbaum's Syndrome, from which Cass suffers; and her relationship with Axel. We learn early on that Axel has assumed the identity of a friend in Antwerp, Belgium, during World War II. So, in Ancient Light Alexander Cleave, Cass's father, is starring in a biopic of the person known as Axel Vander. I always find myself flagging passages and new words in Banville's novels. I tried not to this time; I'm reading a library book and I just have to take out the flags before I return the book. But about halfway through, I gave up and started marking passages. Like this one from page 153: ...\"am I not, like everyone else, like you [Cass], like you especially, my protean dear, thrown together from a legion of selves?... This separate, hidden I is prey to affects and emotions that do not touch me at all, except insofar as I am the channel through which its reponses must necessarily be manifest.\" Axel is not really Axel Vander, but more importantly, he's someone other than the person he shows to anyone. Even Cass. I loved this book. Banville just writes so beautifully and his characters are endlessly fascinating and complex. I didn't need to read this book to enjoy Ancient Light and in fact, reading that book first probably contributed to my enjoyment of Shroud. Knowing what happens doesn't matter.

Poor Cass, she feels less like a believable character than a sort of wish-fulfillment fantasy, like the one Eco indulges in Baudolino.

It was quite critical saying that \u201ca couple of passages midway point take the narrative clean off its hinges...a lesion in the book\u2019s reality that never fully heals over.\u201d The reviewer cites the main problem being Banville\u2019s management of the points of view, particularly the merging of the two POVs in the middle of the novel. I noted the merging while reading it but found that it was (for me anyway) quite in keeping with the general tone of the book and with what I believe Banville was trying to achieve. This is not a spoiler and if anything will help future readers who are wondering what is happening around page 125 or so. As readers of the first book in the trilogy Eclipse will be aware, one of the two main characters Cass Cleave is mad. \u201cShe looked at her watch and sighed. A single, gloating voice began whispering in her head.\u201d Or this: \u201cThat was how it was with her, she was the plane and her mind was the jet engines trying to speed away from it. She was barely held together. The slightest jolt might make her fly apart into a million pieces.\u201dIt was quite a relief (in this book) to finally discover what Cass is suffering from and it\u2019s no surprise either that in many ways Axel Vander is mad too. As he says himself so eloquently - his life has been a series of poses. \u201cI lied to escape, I lied to be loved, I lied for placement and power; I lied to lie.\u201d The book is filled with references and allusions to real and imaginary characters. There are Nabokian references cited by the reviewer. (Note to self: Read Nabokov.) Allusions to Harlequin, Cordelia and the life of Paul de Man and of Nietzsche. I love the rendering of Vander\u2019s youth in Antwerp and the onslaught of Naziism. The scenes are believable and tense. Turin is very much present too. \u201cThey came out into a long, cobbled piazza. A bronze horseman strode motionless above them in the dark air, with a light from somewhere gleaming on his brow.\u201d When Vander arrives in London during WWII he meets the very wealthy Laura - a fascinating character who had me reeling with a decision she makes. With Vander being a writer Banville has to be on top of his game when depicting the thoughts of this difficult, cantankerous and very old man. I loved this observation: \u201cSome things, real things, seem to happen not in the world itself bit in the gap between actuality and the mind\u2019s apprehending; the eye registers the event but the understanding lags.\u201d Although much is gradually revealed by Vander to the reader we are still left wondering is the shroud still over our eyes? I was cursing Vander for a final tricky revelation at the same time praising his choice of just three simple words: TIME. NIGHT. WATER that finish one of the most important last scenes in the novel. I found that after swimming through page after page of brilliant adverbs, dazzling adjectives, clever verbs in abundance, when I came upon these three simple words that the effect on me as a reader was staggering!

This book is part of his favorite theme of exploring one's identity. Who are we truly? Although I didn't see it at first, \"Shroud\" is the perfect title for this book on many levels. I won't spoil it for you - you'll see it too. In \"Shroud\" Banville creates a monstrous protagonist, a train wreck of a man who is not who or what he seems, whose identity is lost even to himself. Yet, despite the deck that Banville stacks against Axel Vander, this reader was compelled to follow his unconscious quest to be revealed - and reviled - for who he truly is. He knowingly flies too close to the sun but does not exactly suffer Icarus' fate.Pick up a John Banville book today.

The story of a man who took the name of a beautiful Aryan friend to escape Nazi Europe, even though the dead, beautiful, wealthy friend wrote a few anti-Semitic newspaper articles. Then the changeling goes on to reach the heights of academia as a critical theorist in America. At 80+, he is threatened with exposure, of a Nazi past that is not his, of a name that doesn't belong to him, by a deranged young woman who may only want to get near to him. The question is posed, What is our true nature? Are we closest to our true selves when we self-create, which is to say lie? Are we closest when we steal the identity of the man we wish to be and make of the theft and our own will to transform something greater than what we were or what the desired man might have been? And the account we are reading--its integrity is unstable. Whe de Man character falls in with a young woman who threatens to expose his impolitic past, they become lovers, and at one point he tells her she can write his biography. She can even write it in the first-person, he says. A lovely trick, adding onto the identity theft in the narrative another that we might have no way of knowing for sure.Then the final third of the novel, which is not so much disastrous as it is puzzling. Because it begins packing up its uncertainties and disturbances at the moment when they should be proliferating out of control. Not to mention that Banville has the narrator fall in love, which may be a nod to Beckett's \"First Love,\" but which is all the same out of place, a betrayal of the character, and perhaps a misreading of Beckett. Rather than uncertainties and questions of identity, we are left with received certitudes, and these are of the usual WWII-Holocaust kind, the persistence of blood, the penalties of turning one's back on the tribe, etc. Killing off the girl while pregnant makes a certain \"literary\" parallelism sense, but Banville ought to be strong enough to resist easy symmetries for the more roilsome energies a story like this can unleash."}, {"userName": "Book Wormy", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32493366-book-wormy", "userReview": "Shroud John Banville\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Shroud is a story of unreliable narrators and hidden pasts. Axel Vander having survived the Nazis has made a life for himself as a famous author living in American, yet Axel is not who he claims to be and one day the letter he has been half expecting his whole life arrives. The letter is from a young woman Cass Cleave who (in true horror movie style) claims to know what he did...Cass uses her knowledge of his past to summon Axel to Turin a town where he has several old colleagues who have tried and failed for years to get him to visit.From the start we know that Axel is a grumpy old man with a history of being violent and aggressive and of course we know he has a secret, a secret someone else now knows. When we meet Cass all we know is that she is young and Irish that her father is a failed actor and that her childhood has not been happy as the narrative progresses we learn that Cass is suffering from a mental disorder that means she confuses reality and fantasy. The narrative switches between the two main characters as a general rule the Vander sections are first person and the Cass sections third person a style I think works as it shows the unreliability of both of them.I actually found myself quite enjoying the story even though who knows exactly what is never spelled out clearly something I normally find frustrating, as for the ending I found it to be touching in a strange way but entirely inevitable."}, {"userName": "Tom McDade", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/844462-tom-mcdade", "userReview": "A masterfully written novel. Duplicity, broken bodies and souls, not much happiness beyond this:\"I am not the first to have exclaimed upon the pleasures of life in wartime London. I do not mean the great, new, warm sense of communality everyone is supposed to have felt, the keeping up of peckers ('keep your chin up' in Britain) and home-fires burning and all the rest of that twaddle; no, what I am thinking of is the licence, voluptuous and languid, with just a whiff of brimstone to it, that was granted to us by the permanent likelihood of imminent, indiscriminate and violent death. Living there with Lady Laura and her money was like being on an ocean liner out of control and hopelessly adrift yet on board which all the indulgent decorums of a luxury cruise are punctiliously observed. What did It matter that up on the bridge the captain was drunk and down in the bilges the crew was frantically pumping? Despite the bombs and rumors of bombs, despite the austerities and the tiresome restrictions on everyday living, we flitted, my little lover and I, from bar to bar, from club to club, from party to party, heedless, and as happy as probably either of us was capable of being. The city was all plangent airs and melancholy graces.\""}], "description": "Axel Vander is an old man in ill health, recently widowed, a scholar renowned both for his unquestionable authority and the violence that often marks his conduct.
