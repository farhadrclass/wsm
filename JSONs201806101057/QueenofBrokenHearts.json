A perfect society!....Ha....Divorce women are starting out on a new journey and therapist Clare Ballenger has focused exclusively on helping these divorce women mend their broken hearts and land back on their feet stronger than ever. As we get to know Clare more intimately, we soon realized that she does not follow the same advice she gives to her clients. The last thing she wants is to fall in love again since suffering the loss and grief from when her own husband died in a tragic accident. There are numerous characters - yet easy to keep track of them all. Clare has two men interested in her: Rye who was her husband\u2019s close friend and Lex, a Yankee from Maine. Dory is Clare\u2019s best friend \u2014- but Clare can\u2019t stand her wealthy husband named Son. Haley is Clare\u2019s daughter - married to a jerk named AustinSo....mostly it\u2019s the women in this novel whom this story centers around. Between the writing - the dialogue- and the exaggeration ( in a good way)....there may be many relationship problems going on \u2014 but we definitely get that SOUTHERN BELLE COMMUNITY FEELING in this novel.A little long - some parts I liked more than others - I laughed out loud several times- I drifted off at times too- (too much chatter about \u2018doves\u2019 and their white wings), but for whatever reason - I mostly liked it -( nice garden-listening)...Lightness - sweetness - a little gripping (not \u2018too\u2019 much- haha: not too much)- and a happily ever after ending. \ud83d\ude423.5 rating"}, {"userName": "Vicky", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4896571-vicky", "userReview": "\"Queen of Broken Hearts\" by Cassandra King is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It is poignant, uplifting, tear-jerking and insightful. When I opened the book to the first page, my heart plummeted. First person point of view \u2013 not my favorite. And I'd just finished another review book in first person that I most definitely did not like. Not only was this one in first person, but present tense \u2013 a double whammy. To say I started reading with a negative attitude in place would be a truism. Then the story took over and I forgot about the point of view. While the present tense did occasionally intrude, the story was so well written that I couldn't count that against it. Like \"Steel Magnolias\" or \"Fried Green Tomatoes\", this is a story of the deep South, but it touches on themes that affect us all.The story is set in a small Alabama coastal town and centers around Clare, a therapist who's got her own problems. Clare, a widow, runs group sessions and retreats for women going through divorce. Her work is everything to her, even taking precedence over the two men who want her as more than just a friend. She can dish out advice, but when it comes to taking it herself, Clare has more than a few problems. Full of quirky characters, \"Queen of Broken Hearts\" will make you laugh and cry, cheer and boo, but most of all, it will make you keep reading to the very end. The story has a touch of romance and all the angst you can handle as you get a peek at the lives of the inhabitants of Fairhope. This one is definitely a keeper."}, {"userName": "Shelleyrae at Book'd Out", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1607230-shelleyrae-at-book-d-out", "userReview": "You need to read this in the garden with an iced tea or mint julep to sip on. The language is evocotive of Southern society and the environment and it flows with description and dialogue. The pace can feel a bit slow unless you have the time to enjoy it - its not a quick read. There is a huge cast of characters but interestingly it doesn't feel crowded as can often be the case. They are well developed and complex but the relationships between the characters and in general are really the heart of this book."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4725799-dana", "userReview": "Today I finished the LONG, 412 page novel by Cassandra King (who happens to be the wife of Pat Conroy, one of the most talented writers living today---If you have never read The Prince of Tides, it should be on your short list-----) called The Queen of Broken Hearts. The novel is set in Alabama and is filled with deeply drawn, flawed, but lovable, characters. The protagonist is a widow, in her late 40's or early 50s, whose husband died in the woods near their home, when the gun he was carrying went off. That is all we know until nearly the end. Was it suicide or an accident? There was no foul play. The couple had been madly in love but there were demons that, perhaps, needed tending. Claire is a therapist who counsels women going through divorce. She runs retreats for these women to help them mourn the loss of their marriages, and to find a way to move on. Claire's best friend, Dory, Dory's husband, Son, and two men who vie for Claire's heart play pivotal roles in the story, as does her mother in law, Catherine-Zoe, and her step daughter, Hailey, whose own marriage may not be all she thought.I loved the descriptions of the thick and plush Alabama countryside, with its unique odors of warm marshes in the deep south, odors which no one can quite imagine if they have not been there. I have, so I could easily relate to the descriptions. There is so much love and caring among these characters. I felt part of their community, felt their losses and joys for the time I spent reading the novel. The book could have been shorter, but I supposed King needed to make it lengthy to include all her detailed descriptions, dialogues and backstories. It was a good book, though not as great as the ratings might indicate."}, {"userName": "Russell Sanders", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1813997-russell-sanders", "userReview": "I approached Cassandra King\u2019s Queen of Broken Hearts with so much raw anticipation. I had just finished and loved King\u2019s The Sunday Wife. I was eager to get caught up her in lovely prose and finely wrought characters again. In that respect, Queen of Broken Hearts does not disappoint. The novel is the tale of Clare Ballenger, a celebrated psychoanalyst specializing in divorce. We see Clare as she navigates her own relationships following her husband\u2019s unexpected death. The book is full of insight into human interaction, dealing with grief, and the logistics of starting over. King has given us all a primer of life with this book. Using engaging characters, we take the journey willingly, eager to reach the outcome, knowing we will be enriched. But ultimately, I was not as enchanted with this novel as I was with The Sunday Wife. King chooses to tell the story in first person, present tense. This gives it an immediacy, an urgency. But darn it, there is so much backstory about each of her participants we, as readers, need to know, that she frequently lapses into past tense. And that\u2019s where it bogged down for me. Yes, I know that all that backstory was needed, that I could never have understood Clare and her story without it. But just when the plot gets flowing nicely, it is interrupted by explanation of what went before. And that was a story killer for me. For others, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t matter, so it certainly shouldn\u2019t be a reason to not pick up this admirable book. And I truly recommend it to anyone who has suffered a divorce. One other thing, I love King\u2019s irony in naming her protagonist Clare. For this woman who sees such clarity in others\u2019 predicaments sees very little in her own. But go with her on her journey and find out if that clarity ever shows up for this aptly named character."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/365038-cindy", "userReview": "I just got this book from my favorite thrift store for books.

She is not a particularly good writer, but she is a real man hater. In every book almost all of the male characters are real sh#ts! None of them are physically abusive to their wives, but they are verbally abusive and put their wives down in a nasty way every chance they get. Since she is married to Pat Conroy, my all-time favorite author, I can't figure out where why she has this hatred of men, particularly men who are in relationships. From what Pat has revealed about himself, he is probably no picnic, although he is a real charmer in person, but I can't believe he treats her like that!The main character in this book is a woman named Clare who has a PhD and a practice as a divorce counselor. She helps women feel better about getting a divorce, although she claims that she is not in favor of divorce. She met her best friend in college. Her friend married a man she had known all her life and always planned to marry and they seem to have a good life. After their two sons grow up and leave home, her husband has the audacity to want to spend more time with her. She wants to start a gardening business, which she does over his protests. Clare is outraged that the man wants to spend time with his wife and does her best to get her friend to divorce him. The friend kicks him out. After a few days, she takes him back and he takes her on a wonderful trip to Europe. All this time Clare is warning that she is making a terrible mistake and she should dump him. What's not to love about this guy?The entire book is foreshadowing, which is way overused. If you are going to tell a story, tell it! Clare's daughter (there's a secret here, which the author drags out for as long as possible) is married to a man who constantly puts her down, but Clare thinks that is just fine. Anyone but a dope would see that he has a girlfriend, which comes out when he leaves his wife and two small children. Good thing she is a divorce counselor and not a marriage counselor!Of course, her own love life is a mess. Her husband, the great love of her life, died several years previously. More tedious foreshadowing about what happened to him. She has two men interested in her, but can't get over her great love for her dead husband. Then we find out he was a hopeless alcoholic and had a lot of other problems. Maybe that is why she cannot stand to see her friend in a happy marriage.I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone!"}, {"userName": "Agatha Donkar", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/189840-agatha-donkar", "userReview": "Picked this one up because one of those what-to-read-next algorithms recommended King's The Same Sweet Girls to me and that one's always out at the library; I didn't know beforehand that King was married to Pat Conroy, who has his flaws as a writer but who I will also defend to the death, because I believe that he can turn a phrase like nobody's business. The first two lines of Prince of Tides still give me goosebumps after all these years.But this is not about Pat Conroy, this is about Cassandra King, and sadly: King is no Conroy. While this book had the same twisted narrative structure, relying heavily on past-tense flashbacks to flesh out character and motivation, and the same dark, morbid, ultimately hopeful plot conventions that Conroy often relies on, the fact of the matter is that Conroy can flat-out write and Cassandra King can't. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it a whole lot, even if I found the protagonist completely unsympathetic; it was a page-turner and I wanted to know how she was going to screw up her life and the lives around her next, so clearly King's doing a little bit of something right.But -- it's not even purple prose, because it's not that inventive. It was just a completely serviceable style of writing, and the plot and the supporting characters, at least, deserved better than that. Unfair to compare a writer to her husband, perhaps, but I can't help but do it -- Conroy's a master of the detail, a master of grounding a book so firmly in a sense of place that you can smell the salt marshes while you're reading his novel in Chicago, and I didn't get any of that with this book. I'll probably pick The Same Sweet Girls up if I ever manage to find it in at the library, but this was a disappointment. I wanted to love it, and I mostly found it boring and uninspired."}, {"userName": "Mary Jo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/637320-mary-jo", "userReview": "This book seemed above all to be about middle-aged lady wish fulfillment. The protagonist\u2019s life is perfect. Her counseling business is expanding and she\u2019s got at least 2 suitors, but you know immediately which one she\u2019ll end up with. The idyllic little Southern town where she lives is complete with \u201ccharacters\u201d and folksy, semi-mystical traditions. It all just seemed bland and happy. The only people in the book with real problems were her daughter and best friend, whose marriages were in big trouble, but for pretty banal reasons that didn\u2019t really interest me. The protagonist\u2019s anxiety and concern about their problems made her seem like a judgmental busybody, actually. The themes had to do with overcoming the past and choosing to be happy in the present despite past losses and pain, which despite their universality, weren\u2019t communicated to me in a way that made me care about them, perhaps because they weren\u2019t especially relevant or resonant in my short, relatively easy life. It seemed like the protagonist should have been able to just get over it already, to mourn her loss and move on, especially since she was a counselor telling others to do the same thing. I just could not believe that it was as hard as she pretended it was. I think that was what kept me from relating. The climax/solution was overly obvious: What, the ritual you created to help other women find closure would be useful for you too? Whoda thunk! My conclusion: this book was not written for me.It\u2019s ok if a book just was not written for me. I\u2019m not worse off for having read it. This book and I can go our separate ways, and I might even recommend it to a divorced woman of my parents\u2019 generation who enjoys easy, shallow, sentimental reads, like Nicolas Sparks or James Patterson.

It was disappointing though in certain aspects. I felt the storyline about Haley and her husband was cut short.

She was strong which I like. I really didn't understand her issues with herself. I understood the issues she had with losing Mack but that seemed normal. I didn't understand her regrets, her struggles. She really didn't have any that had to do with just her. The guilt she had about Mack was real, but what else was there?The setting was the gulf coast of Alabama. I picture old-time southern, coastal scenes. Money.

She and Pat Conroy are my two favorite authors. To me they are a \"super-couple\" (LOL). I first read this book four years ago, the summer after I filed for divorce \u2013 which was fitting since the main character, Clare, is a divorce counselor and her daughter, Haley, and best friend, Dory, both had serious marital problems. Clare also has unresolved issues of her own, as she is still trying to cope with the circumstances of her husband's death years after he passed away. The first time I read the book, I more related to Haley because she was kind of in the same situation I was at that time, almost word for word. Now, years later, I identify more with Clare because I understand her hesitation to get into another romantic relationship after the pain she suffered due to her deceased husband's poor decisions and ensuing actions.

She copes with her husband's hunting \"accident\", a friend's marital unrest and her daughter's dissolving relationship with her husband. My favorite characters are Zoe Catherine and Cooter. Zoe Catherine lives in the woods on her bird sanctuary and Cooter is her \"love\" interest/companion/friend. I enjoyed the quirkiness of Zoe and Cooter's relationship. The book does drag on in some parts however is an overall pretty good read."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1557472-amy", "userReview": "The book Queen of Broken Hearts is a book that is filled with compassion and it makes you think about what you can do to help your fellow community members.
