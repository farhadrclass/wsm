I had to know what happened next. I needed to find out what direction Natalie\u2019s journey would take. It could have went so many different directions. After finishing the story, I think that Corinne handled this delicate situation perfectly.\nNatalie\u2019s life has been a whirlwind of crazy. And it\u2019s taken even more unexpected turns as of late. I loved the way our leading lady handed things. I respected her and admired that she had so much strength in this hard spot. I saw so much growth in her character from the first book. \nAny spoilers for this story would be such an injustice to anyone who is wanting to read it, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m being so tight lipped about the actual story. It\u2019s one you\u2019ll want to go into without knowing how it\u2019s going to go. And if you haven\u2019t had the pleasure of reading Consolation yet, I most definitely don\u2019t want to spoil that either. \nConviction is a captivatingly beautiful story that gripped me from the very beginning. It has a fantastic heroine, a wonderful hero and the writing is superb. Once again, Corinne Michaels left me emotional in the best way. I laughed, I cried and I felt. I truly loved this story. The ending was perfect and I can\u2019t recommend The Consolation Duet enough!"}, {"userName": "Candi~Dirty Laundry Review", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16537005-candi-dirty-laundry-review", "userReview": "I\u2019d like to start by saying first, the beauty of Corinne\u2019s writing is something powerful. This book gutted me. Made me happy. Made me laugh. Yes. There are lots of those laugh out loud moments. You will cry. Happy and sad tears. The writing will strip you bare and truly make you feel every. God. Damn. Emotion. The feels, guys. You will feel it. Everywhere.Can I start by saying holy mother of EFFEN endings in book 1. I swear. I thought my heart was going to literally jump out of my chest. And I\u2019m so glad that book 2 picks up exactly from that moment. What I love about Natalie, is strength. She is by far one of my favorite heroines. I actually think she played a little bit of hero too. She\u2019s the kind of lady you want as a friend. She\u2019s loyal to the core. She stands by her choices and never wavers. She comes out even stronger in this book. She\u2019s grown a lot. Has dealt with more than anyone could ever imagine. And she is determined to not let anything or anyone stand in her way. Liam. Sweet, sexy, strong Liam. I love him. I\u2019m starting to think if I look up the word perfection, the definition will be Liam. Because yeah. He\u2019s just got it all. We get to see a more vulnerable side of him. Which just breaks my heart and made me fall more in love with him. The situation he\u2019s in, it\u2019s twisted and horrific. He has some weak moments, but it\u2019s Natalie this time helping him. And than we have Aaron. I was so conflicted with my emotions for this man. I loved him. I grieved for him. Then I wanted to kick him in the balls and hated him. Then I felt sorry for him. I still don\u2019t know how I feel. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t like him. And it\u2019s wrong if I do. But yeah. If that makes sense. He\u2019s a huge part of the story. I love how everything evolved. And how things turned out. But God. I felt so sorry for him. I hurt for him. See. This is what I mean. My emotions are still all over the place with him. Aaron is a good man. That made a very bad choice. We will leave it at that. I\u2019m trying to not give any of the story away. But I will say this, that ending. That couldn\u2019t of been a more perfect ending. I love the places everyone was in and where everyone should be. I don\u2019t think my heart could of stood another ending like book 1. If you have not read this book, or this series, you truly must. This is one of those books that will just make you feel everything. One you won\u2019t forgot. This series is military related. It will give you a whole new level of respect for military families. Their struggles, their loyalties, their heartaches. Their strength. Their selfless sacrifices. And to the military wives. You ladies. Are my heroes."}, {"userName": "Aestas Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5604583-aestas-book-blog", "userReview": "::: FULL DOUBLE REVIEW POSTED ::: SQUEEEE!!!!! What an\u00a0awesome book duet!! I read both books in this series back-to-back and absolutely loved them!! I was hooked from the first page of the prologue and couldn't put either book down even for a minute. These books were\u00a0\naddictive\n, thrilling, \nemotional\n, romantic, \nsexy\n, and everything I could want in a series!\u00a0I'll be honest, it was the blurb of the first book that made me want to read them...\nLiam wasn't supposed to be my happily ever after.He wasn't even on my radar.He was my husband's best friend\u00a0--\u00a0forbidden.\nBut my husband is dead and I'm alone. I ache for him and I reach for Liam.\nOne night with Liam changed everything. Now I have to decide if I truly love Liam or if he's just the consolation prize.\nSee?? C'mon. Admit it. That's intriguing!What you don't know from the blurb (but is revealed in the prologue) is that the heroine was pregnant when she got word that her husband was killed so this story isn't just about her and Liam, it's also about her daughter too. And let me tell you... watching Liam with this little baby girl was\u00a0heart-melting!!!I loved the way Liam came into their lives. There was nothing rushed about it. Initially he was just there to watch over them. He's been her husband's best friend and wanted to do for him what he would have done for any of his fallen brothers -- care for their loved ones. Their romance just... happened. It was very believable to me and I absolutely was rooting for them. He was open and honest with Natalie about everything\u00a0-- talked with her about things he could have hidden, helped her in every way he could, was just\u00a0there for her through everything, and also welcomed her daughter equally into his heart.\n\n\n      Lying on the couch is Liam with [my daughter] fast asleep on his chest. Her tiny hand is wrapped around his and they\u2019re both holding on to each other. His huge body shields her as his arm holds her tight. It breaks my heart and mends it at the same time. Two parts of me are pulled apart. The one side that\u2019s sad it\u2019s not her father. The other part is grateful it\u2019s Liam. Aarabelle shifts a little, and even in his sleep, he moves to\u00a0accommodate and protect her.\n    \n\nThe story was honestly just\u00a0\naddictive\n to an extreme. It's the kind of story where you start it and then suddenly realize that you're half way through and feel like you've barely stopped to breathe. It's well written, flows smoothly, and the story just draws\u00a0you right in and keeps you flipping pages!It's told in alternating POVs (but more of her POV than his). It was angsty, but not gut-wrenching, emotional but not the ugly-cry kind... it was just enough of everything to keep my heart racing the whole way through and make me unable to put it down until I got to the very end.Liam and Natalie had fantastic chemistry and their banter was pure awesomeness (I have so many highlighted sections in my book) and I just generally loved the way their relationship built and developed.They had a lot of things to work through though -- like for example how she was naturally wary of falling for another SEAL after already loosing her husband to this dangerous career. But regardless of the set backs, they fell strong and hard for each other and I totally\u00a0believed in their love.\n\n\n      It\u2019s difficult to love someone and know they might not come home, but the idea of not loving him is unimaginable. I was built for this life\u00a0\u2014 not every woman can be a\u00a0military wife, but even fewer can handle being a SEAL wife. You have to love deeper, stand stronger, but know that at any\u00a0moment bonds can break.\u00a0\n    \n\nThe ending of the first book was thoroughly gasp-worthy (even though I admittedly did guess that that would happen about half way through the book). Still, it had the intended effect and I immediately dove\u00a0into the next book without hesitation.Given the nature of the twist, the second book was naturally a little more... stressful?... than the first book, but no less addictive.\u00a0For those of you who maybe have worries, I'll just say: don't be scared. K? You guys know the kinds of things that bother me and I promise this series doesn't have any of that. So you're good. Just enjoy the ride!\n\n\n      This isn\u2019t my fight. It\u2019s hers.\n\n      I\u2019ll never be able to push her away. I\u2019ll wait forever if I have to, but I can\u2019t fight this battle.\n\n      She has to be the one to choose me.\n\n      If she loves me like she says, she knows where to find me.\n    \n\nI'm pretty sure I read the second book even faster than I read the first one -- that\u00a0one made me almost more desperate to be sure things all worked out the way I wanted them too. I can say though that I was really thrilled with it. And I loved the way the epilogue completed the story. It was just\u00a0beautiful!If you love badass Alpha male heroes and sexy romances that keep your heart racing, then this highly addictive series is a must-read!\u00a0These are definitely new favorites for me!Rating: 4.5 stars! Complete 2-book series. Contemporary Adult romance._______________________________________ For more of my reviews, book news and updates:\u2726 Main blog: Aestas Book Blog\u2726 Facebook Blog Page\u2726 Twitter \u2726 Subscribe by email"}, {"userName": "Sleepless Readmore", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29809756-sleepless-readmore", "userReview": "The worst distance betweentwo people is misunderstanding.5 All aboard Dreamboat .. time to make some Dreambabies STARSNatalie .. and Liam \u2665Nothing in this world comes easy,but if it's right, you fight for it.\nFight!Fight for me.Fight for us.So what, you're going to walk away?Just hand me over like I mean nothing?I need you, and I'm not letting you gowithout a fight. I lived for you and our daughter.As soon as that clock struck midnight and it was officially the 27th of May .. the anticipation just about killed me! I could NOT WAIT to get home and D-E-V-O-U-R this novel. It feels like I've been waiting CENTURIES not months. The only thing I wanted to do after reading \"The End\" was writing this review. I'm in awe .. speechless! Corinne Michaels never seizes to amaze me .. she captivates you from the prologue straight through to the epilogue. I was DREADING each page because it meant the story was coming to a conclusion. Corinne Michaels keeps on getting better (if that's even possible). Do I recommend?

I was like HOLYF*CK this is going to be a helluva novel. Aaron is ALIVE! He expects to come to his home, his child, and his WIFE. What he doesn't expect is to lose the two closest people to him (his wife and bestfriend .. to one another). One thing I loved about this story was Lee didn't go back and forth. She was certain she loved Liam and not due to the circumstances. She didn't lead on Aaron and was forthcoming with her feelings. I hope Aaron finds his happiness .. hopefully he gets a novel? As for Liam .. he truly found his match with Natalie. He's ideal #BookHusband and talk about #DILF ..

I read a few pages and started balling. I was in shock and honestly disbelief, amazed that just a few pages could completely break my heart.I became mildly obsessed with reading this book. After some serious begging, I was able to read Consolation early. Well, I should have known better, but Consolation only made me want more. Now I have read Conviction, the story is complete, but my heart, the feels, they're still here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always wonder if you really loved me or if I was just the consolation prize.\u201d\n\nWhen we last saw Natalie she was just as stunned as we were, yes, delivering the unexpected is Corinne\u2019s specialty. I was completely blown away and left gasping.There are so many directions Conviction could have gone and I am not sure I would have been too surprised with either direction. I have thought about this situation, rationalized all sides and in the end was left lost as to what direction would be best. Delivering a conclusion to a story like Consolation is difficult, but Corinne did it flawlessly.First, I loved the depth she gave her characters, I was able to empathize with them and feel things I never imagined feeling. Natalie was a character I could admire, she was selfless, but not weak. She was confident in herself and didn\u2019t waiver in her feelings. I loved seeing Natalie grow throughout the story, she is by far one of my favorite heroines.This story made me completely question and doubt myself. I felt crazy going back and forth, but I blame Corinne. Her story is intricate, included all angles and left me with tons of emotions. If you could read my messages while reading this you would think I am crazy. I was going back and forth, crying one moment, laughing another and swooning the next.As I said in the beginning, the story is complete, but my heart, the feels, they're still here. That\u2019s not because I was left wanting more, it\u2019s not because the story is incomplete, it\u2019s because these characters will always have a piece of my heart. I love them. They're real to me, I will never forget some of these moments in Consolation Duet, their heartache or seeing their growth. I cannot recommend this series enough, it is definitely one of my favorite reads of 2015.\nARC kindly provided in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "\u2665 Jx PinkLady Reviews \u2665 ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16496589-jx-pinklady-reviews", "userReview": "[Time isn\u2019t something I ever thought much about.It ebbs and flows, but it never changes.

I was smiling throughout because of the books cuteness..Lee is mental but I'm happy the book didn't go into the weird territory where you didn't know who will be a flake and what will happen... She held her ground because she had love and support and totally took control of her life :)\n\u201cLife is cruel.Love is a joke.And not even death is final.\u201d\nIts frightning how accurate this must be for the wives with husbands in the service... its touching this line..I\u2019m a blank canvas on the easel.

I mean like you loose your head if you can't take control of some aspects of your lifeI had only two problems with this book...1. She always left the kid with a sitter or like anyone and took off... its ridiculous. You wanted that baby soooooo bad, when you have her shouldn't you cherish every moment with her?'mission we lost Brian, Devon, and Fernando altered all of our lives.'And the second problem I had with this book was that, in the first book.. or even maybe even as a start to this book.. we should have gotten a background about HOW these group of people became friends, and how THAT mission, changed their lives which lead him to get so closed off.. It could have been shown as a nightmare Aaron was having; or even Mark, Aaron or Jackson speaking about it in their POV, In this duet series...because I seriously didn't know this book was connected to any previous book until I read the end :PI love it when a book involves all the side characters, and when they are amazing friends!All their friends were wonderful and understanding and always there!anddddd seriously...Could the last chapter get any cuter????? I mean... I cried.. It was overflowing with cuteness and quirkiness.. Thank you Corinne Michaels, for giving me an ARC, I seriously was tooo desperate to know how their story goes. x ~I swear to GOD, I'm going to die.I want/NEED this book like fucking right this minute.My heart and head, both are going crazy! 2 MONTHS?

First I owe Reanell Tisdale a huge thank you for not only recommending this author but for sending me a copy of Beloved; which ultimately hooked me. Part two of the Consolation Duet is tricky, it\u2019s all about the resolution that comes from the first part and the shocking ending of Consolation and so it would be a huge disservice to the readers out there to go into that resolution. If you have not read Consolation yet, fix that. Be wary of spoilers in reviews to Conviction \u2013 avoid them at all costs! I was dying for this book seconds after hitting the end in book one. After that ending, I knew I wouldn\u2019t survive the long (which ultimately wasn\u2019t long \u2013 a few months, but in book world that is like a lifetime!) wait. I was dying. I needed book two. This reader had questions and needed answers, but most of all I was scared to know. I was equal parts fearful and excited to start this read. I knew it was going to consume me and I also knew that I was going to be an utter mess while reading it. I was gutted within the first 10% of this book. My heart broke and then it broke again. The dual POV allowed me to get attacked by the feels at all sides \u2013 I was in tears and I didn\u2019t even make a dent in the story. At 15% I got the piece of book one that I wanted so badly and it confirmed everything I thought it would, but even that moment made everything more intense, more emotional. From this point to the halfway mark I was an utter mess. I was waiting for a huge moment that would twist my insides. The angst was delivered perfectly. I had to stay guarded, I had a heart I needed to protect but I couldn\u2019t help myself from having hope. This battle between my head and heart was all consuming and at this point, I was way past midnight and knew I hit the point of no return. There was no way I was going to be sleeping. Corinne Michaels\u2019 wrote an incredibly gripping love story that was not an easy read, nor was it a simple story of two people falling in love. We grieved alongside these characters, we were standing beside them with our fist held high in anger, and we wept with them. One thing I love about this series (and the prior) is that although we are getting military heroes; we are getting a look inside the lives of the women who love them. We are shown the strength they have while they hold their lives together at home while their hearts are halfway around the world. Often times we get the romances with the soldier who has returned home, we rarely see the side of the story for those who are still active duty. I love that this author is paying homage to the wives of those serving. Jackson might have made me weak in the knees, but Liam stole the breath from my lungs. I am excited for Mark\u2019s story in Defenseless and although Liam is going to be hard to top, there was something about the Mark we saw in this book that makes me think we are in for one helluva story. Now although this duet can be read as a standalone, I highly recommend that if you are going to read it \u2013 that you also read the Beloved Duet."}, {"userName": "Vrsha (PeekAtMyBookReview)", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18263404-vrsha-peekatmybookreview", "userReview": "NO RATING: DNF @25 %BEWARE: ANGRY REVIEW AHEAD!!!*I\u2019m firing at all the shoes and rotten tomatoes coming my way*To be honest\u2026I\u2019ll just ignore this book except the ending because it totally ruined the first one for me.

Can you possibly have more drama than this?! Okay, so I knew going into this book that shit had just hit the fan. The ending of the first book, Consolation, left me no choice other than to buy this book. In all honesty, I wasn't impressed with the first book and reluctantly bought this one because I had to know how things ended. I'm in the minority here, mind you. Many people loved this, just not me. The drama was unparalleled and preposterous, literally crammed into every.single.page. I could easily predict what would happen because if you pictured the worst possible scenario, then it would occur. The angst was high, understandably, and the character dynamics were eyebrow raising. I couldn't believe the developments that happened. Have you ever read a book that you couldn't put down but hated the fact you couldn't put it down? That was me with this book, and not in a guilty pleasure sort of way. I'm so glad I finished, so glad I turned the last page. Everything was so far fetched and ridiculous.

Like there are no words powerful enough to express yourself.I\u2019ll be honest having not read this author before I didn\u2019t know what to expect and I didn\u2019t think her words were going to effect as much as they have. Sitting here now writing this I feel like I\u2019ve just been on one of the most beautiful adventures of my life and everything around me didn\u2019t exist but these characters and the goosebumps covering my arms whenever I think about them are just a reminder that it was real to me.I pretty much experienced every emotion possible with this story from crying a few pages in to getting that butterfly feeling when you first meet the book boyfriend to feeling my heart shatter into a million pieces to being so shocked and pumped with adrenaline that I couldn\u2019t stop shaking. I\u2019m completely emotionally fucking drained.Liam and Natalie have a love that I\u2019ll never forget. Sometimes you read these romance books and wonder if 10 down the line would those couples still be together? With these two their love was so strong and so powerful, it would last an eternity.It wasn\u2019t an easy love but it was a love songs are written about.Consolation and Conviction are by far one of the most beautiful books ever written and one I will hold close to my heart for the rest of my life."}, {"userName": "Sharon \u221e\u2765 is an emotional book junkie \u2765\u221e ", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3275325-sharon-is-an-emotional-book-junkie", "userReview": "3.5 - 4 \u2605's At the end of the first book, Consolation, there was a big bombshell and now everything is in utter chaos. The only good thing is that Natalie knows exactly what she wants. My one big problem with this book, (and I can't believe I'm really saying this), is that there is just too much angst. That's right...too much, as in, over the top, cheesy and never ending. It was almost borderline ridiculous at times. But...I was happy with the way Natalie handled things. Thank goodness for having a female lead with a good head on her shoulders. Unfortunately, Natalie does have a whole other situation she has to deal with. However, with this being the last book...there has to be some resolutions and there are. I enjoyed how things turned out and it was very sweet and romantic. I also enjoyed getting to know all the other characters, especially the ones that will be having their own books. I think that CM set things up nicely and definitely got my interests up. \nThe Good Stuff:\nDual Pov's? Again, mostly Natalie's but a few chapters from Liam's POV. Steam Factor? (Scale 1 - 5) 3ish...not as much as the first book. Angst? (Scale 1 - 5) 5+++ Next book? This is the last for Natalie. Jackson already has two books out. Mark's book is Defenseless, and Quinn's is Indefinite. Both don't have release dates at the time of this review.\nFavorite quotes:\n\u2665 \"That was quite a way to welcome me to South Carolina.\"\u2665 \"It was all my super sperm.

The first being that it was beautifully written and left my heart soaring. Corinne, sure knows how to make a person suffer. From start to finish, I was feeling a wide range of emotions. If you\u2019re just tuning in, Consolation is the first book, and it ended with the mother of all BANGS!! Now with Conviction, we experience Lee, in a whole new light. She\u2019s strong beyond everything that is thrown at her and even in the moments of despair she pulled through. She didn\u2019t back down for nothing. That to me, is a true heroine. Sigh Dreamboat\u2026 Liam. Man, oh man, how much I love this man! He too grows as a character and we witness a vulnerable side of him. We experience in every way that personal side of him that makes us fall more in love with him.This book will take you on a journey of emotional turbulence; you feel emotions on every page. Saying goodbye to characters you become attached to is always hard but I\u2019m content with where they ended. The ending couldn\u2019t have been more perfect!!

I tried so hard to like it, I really did. But I just couldn\u2019t see in it what everyone else did. I think it was important for me to have connected to the characters in the first book, and since I didn\u2019t, I should have anticipated this. I was curious to see as to how the story will enfold after that cliff hanger, but it still didn\u2019t improve much for me. I\u2019ve yet to finish this book but I just don\u2019t think I can go on.Maybe it\u2019s just me, maybe it\u2019s not the book because everyone else seems to love it. I personally, could not stop criticising the heroine; her drama tactics and the lack of feels I experienced have just done it for me.I think Natalie and her confusing speech was one of the things which made me want to quit it. A few examples:\"Aaron chooses to let me go while Liam would've been at the car already.\" This is a lie seeing as Liam backed off to let her make amends with her husband. And just two minutes before he asked her not to leave. Dafuq Natalie? I'm not sneaking behind your back and doing God knows what while we were still married.

Corinne Michaels can bring the angst and tears like no other. She delivers passionately hot romance that is deep and gut-wrenching, and she NEVER makes the road to HEA easy! Such is the case with Natalie Gilcher and the men who love her.If you read book 1, you know she fell hard for her deceased hubby's bff and Seal partner Liam Dempsey. Hell, we all fell for him! While I loved the tragic love story that was, I was left shocked at the return from the dead, past cheating, forever love Aaron...Say WHAT???Yep, I do not know who was more devastated...me or the characters! Have no fear...I KNEW that no matter what, Liam would get his HEA. Why? you ask...well because he is simply amazing and he damn well deserved it!So while it seems as if a long tedious love triangle was about to ensue there was just one love story to tell...just one couple that were it...just one love that was forever...LIAM and NATALIE!\nyes, I know the husband was back, but he was just wrong. He cheated...nuff said! So I am moving on from him. The only drama here is just convincing Liam that he truly is loved and deserving. Natalie knows who and what she wants...\nPage after Page of Natalie finally getting herself back. She grows strong and she grows sassy! She knows what she wants and she will not let time or outside voices influence her. She knows there is a difference between \"love\" and \"cannot live without the mere thought of you love.\" Liam didn't just provide her comfort and support during a dark time in her life. He physically and emotionally claimed her heart. How could he ever doubt that? How could anyone?\nSo Happy to have the fabulously perfect conclusion!"}, {"userName": "MJ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14576940-mj", "userReview": "The anticipation for this book was overwhelming for me. I fell in love with Natalie's story in Consolation and craved the conclusion I know I would find in Conviction. To say I was overwhelmed by the beauty of this book is an understatement. Corinne Michaels has once again proven she is an incredible writer who delivers exactly what the readers desire.The author is so well versed in the military life that her ability to convey the absolute joy and horror Natalie faced at finding her presumed-dead husband, Aaron, alive felt completely viable. This could definitely happen in real life and I found myself completely consumed with how Natalie could possibly be able to reconcile her life now that she had fallen in love with Aaron's best friend Liam Dempsey. This book covers the agonizing journey she must now take in trying to come to the right decision that is both right for her heart and for her daughter. But it never felt overdone or redundant or superficial. It is a powerful story of one woman's fight to get the happy ending she both craves and deserves.What I loved the most was Natalie's drive. Never does she back down or run away like so many other heroines I've read before in her situation. This woman knows what she wants and is not afraid to make it happen. Not wanting to hurt either Aaron or Liam, we are witness to the compassion and sensibility Natalie encompasses in order to realize the dreams she so desperately doesn't want to give up. Watching her juggle a myriad of conflicting emotions, wanting to do right by everyone involved and not losing herself or her beloved daughter, Aara, in the process was quite the feat. To the Author's credit, this rollercoaster of heartbreak was handled with true grace. I loved the way the story progressed and the heroine's ability to handle such conflict when she didn't know at times where to turn.The secondary characters are the perfect compliment to this book. The love each of the guys have for Natalie, Liam and Aaron, warmed my heart. The loyalty that is on constant display was a joy to read. Reanell is the friend we all wish we had to lean on. And Mark stands out for me as the big brother we all want by our side when times get tough.I would be remiss if I didn't at least express my feelings about Liam. There aren't enough words for this man. This selfless, caring, compassion and sexy man who would move mountains and step aside if it would make Natalie happy. How he loves Aara as his own, how conflicted he is yet prays he'll get the life he never knew he wanted but is now desperate for. I will only say that my passion for him grew by leaps and bounds in this book and he is definitely a book boyfriend I won't soon forget.The author's writing has been taken to a higher level with this series. Her capacity to convey tender moments, passionate nights, all-consuming heartbreak and even lighthearted exchanges all in one story is not an easy task. But she wrote a beautiful tale that at times took my breath away. I didn't want it to end simply because I was enjoying it that much, despite all the pain.I will only say this: I strongly suggest you read Consolation first, then dive right into Conviction. This is a series that happily grabbed onto my heart and didn't let go until that very last page was read. And even now, I'm not quite sure I'm over this story. A reread is definitely in order!You will devour it just like I did. Don't say I didn't warn you because yeah, it's that good.

Love is a joke. And not even death is final.\u201d\n\nConviction is another great read from Corinne Michaels. After the ending of Consolation I was on high alert for a lot of emotion and a lot of angst and Corinne Michaels delivered on both counts. While this was not as emotional as Consolation, this book was more a journey, a journey for all three of them.The one thing I loved the most in this book was Natalie\u2019s CONVICTION, this woman knew what she wanted and didn\u2019t waver, she had her wobbles but right from the onset she knew who she wanted and she stuck to her guns. While the \u201cother man\u201d tried his best to get her to change her mind, Natalie was a force to be reckoned with and out of everybody in this book; it amazed me that she was the strong one. The men crumbled, Natalie remained strong and resilient, she was the cement, now she just needed her brick.\n\n\u201cYou have no idea how strong you are.\u201d\n\nThe fact that this was not the drawn out \u201cwill she, won\u2019t she\u201d book that most probably all of us anticipated was refreshing. After a while that to and fro, back and forth can be soul crushing and I was glad that this was not prevalent in this book. As I said above, this book is a journey, still a long one, there was a lot of soul searching to be done by all parties and this was captured brilliantly within these pages.\n\n\u201cHe knows that was the end of any chance he had. He just lost me. Completely.\u201d\n\nThe growth in Natalie\u2019s character was amazing, as I said above the change in her from Consolation was dramatic, in Consolation she was destroyed but we slowly saw Liam put her back together again, the emotional scars were still there, but she living and glad to be alive. In Conviction her strength was unparalleled, she was the driving force in this book, she called the shots, you couldn\u2019t help but stand back and admire her, after everything that she had been through, she was still standing and she was standing tall and proud.\n\n\u201cIgnorance is a beautiful place sometimes, but I don\u2019t plan to live there anymore.\u201d\n\nAs much as I would love to go into my thoughts and opinions of the men involved in this book, to do that would be a huge disservice to those that haven\u2019t read this book yet. Even the smallest of opinions would still be a spoiler so I am going to refrain. I think that after the end of Consolation we all had our favourite, I know I did. I wasn\u2019t at all disappointed, I totally understood and I loved the way that Corinne Michaels delivered this to us, the readers.This was one great love story, I have cried, I have grieved, I have loved, I have had those emotional lows and then some amazing emotional highs throughout this series, this is testament to Corinne\u2019s writing because she really delivered a well thought out, emotional, gripping read. I was totally invested in this story, I had been itching for Conviction\u2019s release and was so glad that we didn\u2019t have too long to wait, another plus side to this duet.\n\n\u201c\u2026because if this plays out poorly, it\u2019ll be my heart that never beats again.\u201d\n\nI am a sucker for military romances too and you can tell that the author has first hand experience of what it is like to be the one left behind. I love that we get to see this side of a soldier\u2019s life. We are always hyper aware of what or how a soldier thinks and it is refreshing to see the other side. I was trying to look for an appropriate quote but I found an even better one instead \n\u201cBehind every strong soldier, there is an even stronger woman who stands behind him, supports him, and loves him with all her heart.\u201d\n This is what this series shouts from the pages, these women are strong.\n\n\u201cMilitary wives aren\u2019t strong because they want to be. They have to be.\u201d\n\nAlthough Consolation and Conviction are a duet, I highly recommend if you haven\u2019t read the Beloved series yet that you read that too. Although this duet is Liam\u2019s, Jackson and the crew all appear throughout and I personally think that you would get a better understanding of the dynamic between these characters. I understand that Mark is up next and I cannot wait to see what Corinne has in store for us with him. He is quite the enigma and I am sure that we are going to be surprised when his surfaces are scratched.I have loved this series with a passion, true romances with a good ole dose of angst, with great underlying messages throughout.
