I thought it was boring and I didn't really care what happened to the main character. I was totally distracted by how the author called him \"the youth\" instead of his name and I had to have my brother-in-law explain to me what the point of it was since I just couldn't tell.

Henry Fleming a naive , restless farm boy not yet a man, from New York State, goes off to fight during the American Civil War. Against the tearful pleading of his widowed mother not to, Henry out of patriotism or boredom wants to join the Union Army. Many months pass of training and marching, before Fleming gets into action. Some of his friends, boys he grew up with are in the 304th regiment with him. Camp life is very harsh living , mostly in dirty tents, little food and nothing to do, unsanitary living conditions , the constant marching to different sites, the veterans call the newcomers \"Fresh Fish\". Wondering if he'll be brave or a coward in the conflict dominates his thoughts, finally the youth see's the ugly war. The charging , yelling mobs of rebels, from out of the woods brings fear to his very soul and Fleming caring little about glory, his friends or the regiment runs away , runs like the little boy he really is, only just wants to survive...Meeting many wounded soldiers in the back of the line. Some who will not live long, including his close friend who Fleming watches fall mortally down on the ground, they ask him uncomfortable questions, where was he hit ?...Leaving them as fast and unobtrusively as possible, wandering around aimlessly, Henry heads for a nearby forest trying to get away from the savage war. The sounds of brutal battle are muted by the trees only a short distance from the struggle, as if all the world , was a peaceful quiet place, a sanctuary for him to calm his nerves. But Henry can't get far from reality, a Union soldier propped up against a tree, stares with his dead eyes at the miserable deserter. An insect crawling over his ghastly face, Henry decides to get back to his regiment yet ironically is hit in the head, with a rifle butt by a vicious man fleeing in a blue uniform, Fleming was in the way, causing blood to flow freely...His desired ,\" Red Badge of Courage\". Arriving home helped by an unknown soldier, nobody had noticed his cowardliness they thought he was dead, bandage his \"war wound\". Next day another scrimmage, Fleming feels different , comradeship with his fellow soldiers close as brothers now, Henry never experienced such emotions before, even leads the charge, has he become a man?"}, {"userName": "matt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32467-matt", "userReview": "This book made my heart race and made me hear gunfire.I think Crane manages to create the perfect visceral novel.

There might be historical value in this novel, written by Stephen Crane who was born nearly five years after America\u2019s civil war ended, but there is little to enjoy. The novel does focus on the psyche of the protagonist \u2013 more so then on the war itself, but I found myself not caring. I didn\u2019t care for the characters nor did I care about the battles or the war. I told myself that I would give the novel a fair review only by reading it in its entirety, which led me to gloss over the last few chapters as to end the torture.I debated giving two stars as there was one scene that I noted as compelling \u2013 the scene where Henry Fleming watches Jim Conklin struggle to continue marching while Jim is dying of wounds from the battle. This was a moment where Henry experiences firsthand that war is hell. However, one powerful scene cannot resurrect this lifeless corpse of a book.

Perhaps not! At some point he actually runs, but his conscience torments him. A series of happenings (accidental- i think) push him back to track, and there he tries to prove his manhood.I find that the power of this war novel is not really in the story, but in how it is rendered. Crane's prose (though at some point overly descriptive) is to the large extend exquisite. So also his portrayals of the internal conflict of this youth.

Get on with it...this is boring...\"Overall, I'd have to say that the dialogue between the characters was a little too realistic and I found it difficult to switch between Crane's lovely prose and the uneducated, written dialect of the Union soldiers (or sojers, depending on who you ask). The last time I remember struggling so much with written dialogue was when I read Beloved by Toni Morrison, except in the case for that book, I was utterly enchanted by the characters and this time around...??? Not so much. So in all, it became an issue of not caring enough to WANT to understand what they were saying.Also, I hate battle scenes and fight scenes. I generally skim or skip fight scenes in almost all the books I've ever read (the one exception probably being Gabaldon's description of Culloden in Dragonfly in Amber) because I don't LIKE to picture gore. I'm not comfortable with violence, real or imagined because it gives me nightmares. I don't read or watch horror that involves excessive amounts of blood pouring out of bodies and pooling on the ground and/our punching people out and whenever my husband watches a war movie, I have to cover my eyes during the battle scenes.Unfortunately, 80% of this book WAS a battle scene or related to battle in some way, shape or form so I couldn't skim.

The Red Badge of Courage was written when Crane had never seen battle; it is the product of a young man\u2019s imagination (he was only in his early twenties), trying to vividly capture the experience of war. As a result, the story has elements of both realism and impressionism; it alternates in a space between dream and reality, seeming by turns prosaic and surreal.It is a decidedly well done piece of writing, though I can\u2019t see it evoking much feeling in modern readers. The prose is stylish and forceful; the dialogue is consistently good; the portrayal of the protagonist\u2019s emotional state is done with skill. Still, all told, it does feel a bit more like a writing exercise than a piece of literature. I can imagine the young Crane setting himself the challenge of mentally constructing a battle as vividly as possible, feverishly writing down his daydreams. For such a young man, the writing is done with considerable polish and verve; it\u2019s a shame he died so early.If you listen carefully, you can hear aspects of both Hemingway and Steinbeck presaged in this work. At the time, writing battles this way\u2014as a phantasmagoric sequence of images\u2014wasn\u2019t really done; and since its publication, the book has had a tremendous influence. I think one of the reasons a modern reader will feel numb to its charms is that this book had a huge influence on the modern war movie. As in so many cinematic battles, the political and strategic aspects are deemphasized completely, leaving only the soldier with his gun, his guts, and bullets whirring all around him.

The language is older more descriptive, and at times hard to figure out, but in the end I think it made me appreciate it more. I'm not going to pretend that I understood even half of what the author was trying to say, but It did affect me, and spoke to me personally at times. In my opinion he's a brilliant writer. It's a story of a very young and inexperienced soldier in the civil war named Henry. It tells of his inward struggles finding courage and making sense of this terrible thing called war. It is disturbing at times to read some of the horrors he describes, not because it's graphic, but just emotionally heart wrenching. I love this paragraph:\"As he gazed around him, the youth(Henry) felt a flash of astonishment at the blue pure sky and the sun-gleamings on the trees and fields. It was surprising that nature had gone tranquilly on with her golden processes in the midst of so much devilment.\"After reading this, I could really feel myself in his shoes. Here he is in this captivatingly beautiful place, listening to the stream running by and the birds singing, how can life go so peaceably on for nature, when something so horrible and ugly as war is raging at the same time.It was sad to read how insignificant he felt at times, his lieutenant called his regiment a bunch of slow \"mule-drivers\" and sent them off to charge the enemy stating that few would make their way back. How would that feel? Like being sent off as one of the unimportant masses to be slaughtered for the greater good. I can't imagine.

Contemporaneous memoirs, poems, and histories abound, but Ambrose Bierce\u2019s short stories and Stephen Crane\u2019s \u201cThe Red Badge of Courage\u201d are likely the most prominent examples of literary war narratives from that century. Both are remarkable for their combination of stylized lyricism and brutal, near-cynical unsentimentality. Bierce was a seasoned war veteran but Crane was only 24 when his novel was published to commercial and critical success in 1896. Ironically, Bierce was one of its few detractors.The title of \u201cRed Badge\u201d deceptively suggests conventional, portentous themes of honor and valor, which are reliably de rigueur in war fiction. Crane\u2019s performance both satisfies and subverts expectations: This is one of the most atypical and atmospheric war novels ever written.As the novel opens, young recruit Henry Fleming (referred to as \u201cThe Youth\u201d) waits for action in his encampment, the kind of purgatorial semi-permanent collection of tents captured in scores of Mathew Brady photographs. In this brief respite, Fleming reflects abstractly on the combat experience, and he\u2019s soon tested as his regiment moves into battle.What follows borders on prose poetry. Crane's narrative takes a densely rhetorical and descriptive turn, capturing a profound introspection as the novel transforms into an evocative, unbroken battle sequence in a nameless landscape. Like Shelby Foote\u2019s \u201cShiloh,\u201d which must owe at least a subconscious debt to Crane, Henry fights in a swirl of surreal chaos that provokes a torrent of inward reflection in dramatic synchronicity with Crane\u2019s seemingly continuous evocation of fog, smoke, and any other imaginable form of airborne detritus. The turmoil of battle ebbs and flows, with victory or defeat virtually unknowable in the bedlam of combat; when violence periodically subsides, there is little empirical agreement on what has occurred or whether the regiment has achieved success. Crane wisely keeps this dense, unremitting novel short. This is a controlled, mature performance from a writer who tragically died only four years after its publication. Based on this work and the great short story \u201cThe Open Boat,\u201d he might have produced an unqualified masterpiece. \u201cThe Red Badge of Courage\u201d remains a remarkable artifact."}, {"userName": "Kellyn Roth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52072956-kellyn-roth", "userReview": "Finished this book wishing the main character would just die.

The Red Badge of Courage is one of many books that address fear in the face of death. Henry, a brand new and young soldier in the Civil War, doesn't know how he will react to battle. When his regiment charges the enemy, Henry defects. He is ashamed, but through a variety of circumstances and enormous personal growth (we love this in our novels) becomes a hero among the soldiers of his regiment.This book made popular the term 'red badge of courage' as it applies to an injury received in battle. It is recommended for all new Marine recruits because it examines how first-time soldiers, most who have never shot a rifle at another man much less killed someone, would feel thrown into battle. The main character, Henry, likely reacts as many of us would and many did, so most readers relate to his series of events.Though published in 1895, this book remains an icon of American literature. It is a standard allusion in other writing (akin to 'waiting for Godot'). To be considered educated, adults must read this book to fully understand other writing they'll face. Not only the allusion to 'red badge of courage', but the need of warriors to appear brave in the face of battle, to claim courage as a means of bolstering their reputation and personal identity. We see it often in political figures. I can think of two (I'll leave them unnamed, but you know who I mean) whose prowess in battle is questionable though they claimed the mantle of hero. It's safe to say that mankind's roots remained entangled with our battles, our courage, and our ability to be damaged and survive. I guess relevancy to people dropped their rating. If we can't relate to mind-numbing fear and how we would move forward under its influence, I suppose it would be considered 'boring' or 'irrelevant'. To men, even if I may never face a circumstance where I must do the right thing even when every nerve in my body wants me to do something else, I think this book is important to read. How else would I understand the allusions to it in news articles and conversation?"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/933522-laura", "userReview": "I always seem to write reviews for books I love. That really is a tragedy, because books I hated should be acknowledged here too.This review is a warning to all. Especially the younger set that may still encounter this book in school. If you have a choice, do not read this book, sometimes they offer an array of books to chose from. I am still baffled at how this book was ever deemed a good choice for use in schools. It is the most boring and painful book I have ever read, to this day, and I read it back in 9th grade. It has left that much of an impression on me for how awful it is. It was my own fault. It was for a project and I liked to read and so I picked this book. The book is short, but that doesn't make it go by any faster. Essentially the story of a young soldier in the civil war, and that's the entire plot. I mean, there HAVE to be much more engaging and interesting books out there about the civil war that are relevent to a history course. Maybe the fact that I'm not a great fan of civil war history worked against me (so I've never sought out an alteranative book). One could even go so far as to say this book potentially ruined my relationship with American history in the 1800's. Though the torture of having to read Quaker sermons in college did not extinguished an interest in colonial America. Maybe those reinactment buffs out there think this book is the bomb. I don't know. Either way, I loathed this book when I had to read it, and if it's assigned as required reading in class for either of my children I will send a note requesting alternate material be used, as I think this book is a waste of brain power. (BTW, as a parent, you have a right to do that for any book, in case anyone ever needed to know that tidbit)Consider yourself warned."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "Another triumph of audio books, I finally managed to get through this one. I had to read it for school 40+ years ago & barely managed to skim enough to pass the test. As short as it is, I found it quite boring, even in audio format. Yet I find the book fascinating on several levels. That Crane could write this so well without ever having been a soldier is incredible. The chaos of battle & boredom of waiting comes through so clearly - just too clearly for far too long & too repetitively. I found myself drifting off more than once.This reader wasn't the best. I liked the overall narration a lot, but the actual soldier's speaking didn't impress me at all.

He seemed to have treated straight expressions, simple words, directness and the pared down style as undesirable. I could imagine, for example, Hemingway describing a prisoner with a non-fatal foot wound as one who was angry and who had told his captors to go to hell and to fuck off. Stephen Crane preferred to have it like this:\"One of the prisoners was nursing a superficial wound in the foot. He cuddled it, babywise, but he looked up from it often to curse with an astonishing utter abandon straight at the noses of his captors. He consigned them to red regions; he called upon the pestilential wrath of strange gods. And with it all he was singularly free from recognition of the finer points of the conduct of prisoners of war. It was as if a clumsy clod had trod upon his toe and he conceived it to be his privilege, his duty, to use deep, resentful oaths.\"The principal protagonist, Henry Fleming, he constantly called simply \"the youth.\" Perhaps so that the readers will not forget how young he is. In one battle his was the rallying cry for a brave, heedless charge of his regiment. It could have been done with one, short sentence like that, crisp and economical. But Stephen Crane would have none of that. He'd make big words come stumping the ground to match the drum-like beating of the reader's heart:\"The youth kept the bright colors to the front. He was waving his free arm in furious circles, the while shrieking mad calls and appeals, urging on those that did not need to be urged, for it seemed that the mob of blue men hurling themselves on the dangerous group of rifles were again grown suddenly wild with an enthusiasm of unselfishness. From the many firings starting toward them, it looked as if they would merely succeed in making a great sprinkling of corpses on the grass between their former position and the fence. But they were in a state of frenzy, perhaps because of forgotten vanities, and it made an exhibition of sublime recklessness. There was no obvious questioning, nor figurings, nor diagrams. There was, apparently, no considered loopholes. It appeared that the swift wings of their desires would have shattered against the iron gates of the impossible.\"He got away with this almost inimitable style and molded a coherent story which had been quite exciting when this was first published in 1894 as a serial, and in 1895 as a complete novel.But if you really want to see how good a storyteller Stephen Crane was, I highly recommend his \"The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky.\""}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "Since I'm heading into a WWI segment, I thought I might take the opportunity to backtrack and cover this other nominee for \"Best War Novel Ever.\" Only takes a few minutes anyway, right?The first half is pretty amazing. Crane deals with the concept of cowardice unflinchingly and with a ton of psychological insight. The way he describes exactly what's going on in his protagonist's head, minute by minute...this is pretty great stuff. (Amazingly, btw, Stephen Crane never saw a minute of combat.)I think it loses a little juice in the second half, which deals with bravery; I didn't feel like our hero's change of heart was explained terribly well. Still a pretty impressive book, though."}, {"userName": "BAM The Bibliomaniac ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6595648-bam-the-bibliomaniac", "userReview": "Catching up with the classics #22"}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/969028-andrew", "userReview": "The Red Badge of Courage was a very meaningful book for me.
