This is pretty standard Lifetime movie fare. The good wife lets herself go frumpy. Husband trades her in for a newer model. Journey of self discovery, interspersed with poignant childhood recollections, ensues. I just don't find this kind of thing compelling. The flashbacks were well written, however, and the tidbits of Gullah culture interspersed throughout kept it from being completely forgettable. I found myself wanting more of that, and less in the way of details about how the MC had been losing weight by smoking, chugging diet soda, and eating salads with no dressing.Also, the rest of the book was so riddled with hackneyed dialog, quips, sayings, and excessive exclamation marks, it wore me out. Nobody talks like that.Oh, and the author's attempt at magical realism toward the end made my eyes roll so far back in my head, I nearly lost my balance.

Franks is one of my favorite authors for catching a flavor of the area, and as she is a popular writer, I have about eleventy billion of her books on my BookCrossing shelf. Sullivan's Island is a one of our sea islands surrounding the Charleston peninsula. I live on one across the harbor from it (James Island). It is a beautiful beach, setting for Poe's The Gold Bug, and also the location of Fort Moultrie, which was important in our Revolutionary War. Dottie Frank was also a few years ahead of me in high school- we went to an all-girls boarding school called Ashley Hall. How's THAT for Southern?I do have to say, though, I get a little bored with books about a woman of a certain age returning home to come to terms with herself/her mother/her father/or some injustice, and being nurtured by the land and a solid, almost mystical black woman who has played a huge role in her life. Just sayin'."}, {"userName": "Maurean", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/855228-maurean", "userReview": "Well, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, I have committed myself to quite a bit of reading lately\u2026I don\u2019t usually do that, as I\u2019m one who prefers to just pick up and read whatever strikes my fancy at that particular moment in time. But, as a result of a round-robin I\u2019m involved with, I recently received some titles that I probably wouldn\u2019t have picked up if left to my own devices. \u201cSullivan\u2019s Island\u201d by Dorthea Benton Frank is one of those. While it was a New York Times Bestseller, the pastel artwork (while a beautiful cover!) and the cover blurbs from Pat Conroy and Bret Lott left me the impression that this would be some melodramatic, mushy women\u2019s fiction novels that I find tedious and tiring (no means to offend these authors or their loyal fans!). Now I know this is so clich\u00e9\u2019, but that old axiom that \u201cwe should never judge a book by its cover\u201d is true; this may well be one of the best books I\u2019ve read all year. Frank\u2019s sense of place is so detailed and descriptive, I could literally smell the salt air! (Okay\u2026so, I live at the beach, but still\u2026) Each and every character in this story became \u2018real\u2019 for me, and the story flows so well, it\u2019s hard to believe this is Frank\u2019s debut novel.Set in South Carolina\u2019s low country, the story follows Susan Hamilton Hayes on her life\u2019s journey, as she faces an uncertain future and comes to terms with an often-tremulous past. The chapters of the book alternate between 1963 (Susan\u2019s 13th year) and the present day (1999). When we meet Susan, she and her teenage daughter, Beth, are heading back to her family home, The Island Gamble, to spend some time with her sister and come to terms with the dissolution of her marriage and her estranged husbands infidelities. With the steadfast support of her sister Maggie, Susan wades through the events of her current situation with grace, humor and a steeled determination. I loved Susan\u2019s attitude, having found out that Karen - the New Age twenty-something that is Tom\u2019s (Susan\u2019s husband) mid-life crisis \u2013 was talking to Beth about their sex life, Susan left the following message on her machine:\u201cTiger Woman? This is Susan Hayes calling. Kindly confine the bells and whistles of your sex life with my husband to conversations with other adults. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to educate my daughter about the joys of illegal cohabitation. My daughter is a minor and does not need to hear about how her father and his concubine thrill each other. The minute descriptions of your repugnant gymnastics are of no interest to either one of us. If this message needs any clarification, you may call me. If this continues to be an issue, my lawyer will call you. You\u2019ll find concubine and repugnant in the dictionary \u2013 if you own one \u2013 which I seriously doubt.\u201d (pg. 225)Now THAT\u2019s funny. The other story Susan has to tell is one of her childhood, growing up a Geechee girl and the beauty and heartache that that entailed. As one of six children, brought up with an abusive father, a weak mother, a crazy grandmother and a wonderful, strong Gullah woman, Livvie, the reader is transported to 1963 in a tale of love, pain, heritage and home. The scenes the author paints are vivid:\u201cWe were our own parade. We cast long shadows on the soft, wet sand, bulked up by the towels thrown over our shoulders. Our footprints formed and irregular trail. An occasional sun worshipper would glance up from her paperback novel and remark on our passing to a friend in the beach chair next to her.\u201d (pg. 77)Sometimes infuriating:\u201c\u2026I could hear Timmy crying as the belt cracked across his back\u2026I passed the top of the steps and saw my mother sitting at the bottom, whimpering. She would do nothing about it. I looked at her and she looked away. She was terrified of Daddy when he was like this. I was too furious to be terrified.\u201d (pg. 204) Often times wickedly funny:\u201cReaching for his toothbrush, I looked at it and realized he\u2019d been brushing his teeth for someone else for a long time. I don\u2019t know what possessed me to do it but I dunked it in the toilet. That pleased me so much that I rubbed it around the inside rim.\u201d (pg. 8)And always completely honest and engaging: \u201cIt was unfair that trouble consumed you in landslides and understanding arrived with the miserly drip of a faucet.\u201d (pg. 252) I absolutely loved every word of this endearing, relentless tale; I cannot praise it enough."}, {"userName": "Shell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1005975-shell", "userReview": "I enjoyed reading about steamy and stormy Sullivan's Island off the coast of South Carolina, so different from our beautiful mountainous desert. My favorite character was Livvie, a descendant of African slaves, who lovingly worked for and cared for a dysfuntional Southern family. Here are some sentences from the book that suggest Livvie's sage and spiritual views:\"Her passion for righteousness was stronger than our frenzy.\"Livvie said, \"When folks around you do crazy things, it's the devil trying to distract you from your purpose.\"Livvie also said, \"When you let your mind dwell on trouble, you can't be doing what you needs to be doing,\" and \"...when trouble come knocking on your door, you turn your mind to the Lawd,\"\"Livvie, if you had a chance to do something really big, would you do it?\" \"Chile, I am doing something really big.

I was hooked from the very beginning, could not put this book down and I did not want it to end. Dorothea Benton Frank is a very gifted storyteller!! It's rare, for me at least, to read a book and resonate with characters, feel connected with the story and to feel with the characters so that I laugh, shed a tear or stop to ponder some bit of wisdom that was said. I highly recommend Sullivan's Island. While reading Sullivan's Island, I was reminded of what could be considered similar books: Wrapped in Rain by Charles Martin and in some ways, the YaYa Sisterhood books by Rebecca Wells.

This is Dorothea Benton Frank\u2019s first successful book and I can see why it launched her career. She writes from the heart and from what she knows, having grown up right where the story\u2019s set: South Carolina\u2019s low country, where this story follows Susan Hamilton Hayes on her life\u2019s journey, as she faces an uncertain future and comes to terms with an often-stirred up past. The chapters of the book alternate between 1963 (Susan\u2019s 13th year) and the present day (1999). When we meet Susan, she and her teenage daughter, Beth, are heading back to her family home, The Island Gamble on Sullivan\u2019s Island, to spend some time with her sister and come to terms with the dissolution of her marriage and her estranged husbands infidelities. With the steadfast support of her sister Maggie, Susan wades through the events of her current situation with grace, wit and a steeled determination. I loved Susan\u2019s attitude; how she handled her separation and how she reflects on it with wisdom and maturity.I simply adored the chapters recapturing the Hamilton kids\u2019 youth, one year in particular: 1963. The year, their help, Livvie came into their life. Livvie\u2019s a magnificent character, a tall, strong-willed and wise woman. Loved her every time she opened her mouth, whether it was to stand up to the kids\u2019 formidable, but abusive father, or to share her strong belief in goodness and in God. The Hamilton kids, Maggie, Susan, Henry and Timmy were resilient and good-natured, but also genuine children, who liked to play pranks. 1963 was even more significant as it was the year their Daddy died in a car crash. More than ever now, Susan believes that car crash was no accident.This is a wonderful read. I savoured each page, and I\u2019d surely recommend it to my friends. Personally, I can\u2019t wait to read more books by this author."}, {"userName": "Book Concierge", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge", "userReview": "From the jacket: Born and raised on idyllic Sullivan\u2019s Island, Susan Hayes navigated through her turbulent childhood with humor, spunk, and characteristic Southern sass. But years later, she is a conflicted woman with an unfaithful husband, a sometimes resentful teenage daughter, and a heart that aches with painful, poignant memories. And as Susan faces her uncertain future, she realizes that she must go back to her past. To the beachfront house where her sister welcomes her with open arms. My reactionsI know that Frank writes chick-lit, beach books, so I wasn\u2019t expecting great literature, and my expectations were met. The problem I had with the book comes from Frank\u2019s attempts to tell two stories: the contemporary (1999) story of Susan\u2019s failing marriage, and the 1963 story of Susan\u2019s childhood and the loss of her father. Neither story is sufficiently fleshed out to be satisfying, and I wish she had chosen one or the other to tell. Still, it\u2019s a fast read, and I liked the relationship between Susan and her sister, Maggie. I could have done without the seemingly forced Gullah dialect. And without the mirror that apparently allows one to communicate with the dead. On the other hand, there were a few scenes that were just priceless. I especially loved the scene where the housekeeper Livvie is drinking Coke from one of Susan\u2019s mother\u2019s best crystal goblets, crystal that NO ONE drinks from: \u201cMomma saved that crystal in case President Kennedy decided to come for dinner.\u201d I had to laugh aloud, thinking of my own mother\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d china.

I picked up Sullivan's Island at the YMCA lending library and I felt like I was reading the same book, or at least a variation on that book.Strong middle aged female gets dumped by her husband of many years for a sweet young thing. There's a lot of rehashing of the past, which is the only thing that made the book worth reading. The 1960's south always makes for good reading. I adored Livvie and the fact that Susan's family, or rather her mom and dad weren't bigots and actually built a special bathroom for her, rather than making her use an outhouse was great. (If you read The Help or saw the movie, this will make a lot more sense)Most of the book that takes place in the present, details Susan coming into her own, and coping with her divorce from Tom. And seriously, why does this woman give her cheating men cancer, and make them absolute twits too?There were several times when I was reading about Tom and his sweet young thang, Karen, that I wanted to fling the book at a wall.Not only that, I found myself wondering where in the hideeheck, the twins were during Christmas 1999, when all the Hamilton clan returned home.

Frank definitely understands the lay of the land in Charleston and what it's like to grow up in the Lowcountry - I could relate perfectly to this era and elements like having black housekeepers like Livvie who knew all the family secrets and were part of the family.

I love the reprints and new e-books, with the new high resolution attractive front covers, which are nice to display on your reading list instead of the old outdated covers. (Nice job with Sullivan\u2019s Island-Lowcountry Tales #1 and Plantation \u2013 Lowcountry Tales #2), as read them back to back.A native of the Carolinas and having worked in Charleston, SC years ago, always nice to catch up with the fun female strong protagonists and delightful southern humor. Susan Hayes, a middle-aged librarian from the Charleston area, faces death, divorce, mid-life crisis, daughter\u2019s terrible teen drama, plus many other dramas, as the novel moves back and forth between the early 60\u2019s and present. When Susan discovers her husband, Tom is cheating, she flees with Beth (daughter) to Maggie\u2019s house (her older sister) on Sullivan\u2019s Island. Of course, who would not love the ocean air and low country hospitality and food, to start a new life with support of her family?There are many family dysfunctions including child and spousal abuse, race related bigotry, alcoholism, cancer, adultery, religion, hurricanes, ghosts and murder, as they go back to their childhood memories. As in many of Frank\u2019s books, there is always a favorite loveable and wise housekeeper (Livvie) which you will hear more of in later books, who helps them along the way with life lessons. Highly recommend this series and look forward to The Hurricane Sisters, her latest book coming June 2014.Loved the many quotes: \u201cThe first indication of menopause is a broken thermostat.

Susan Hayes tells two stories \u2013 one in the present, as an adult who is dealing with a failed marriage and raising a teenaged daughter, and one in 1963, as a child who tries to protect herself and her siblings from a dysfunctional home life. While both \u2018Susans\u2019 are funny and likable, by far the more intriguing story is that of 13 year-old Susan. Although her childhood was one of abuse and tragedy, there was also a closeness with her siblings and a sense of perseverance that shapes the adult Susan. The descriptions of the local atmosphere and scenery are wonderful, and scenes from both the child and adult Susan\u2019s lives are laugh out loud funny, like when her kid brother becomes wedged in a ventilation shaft at an old Civil War-era fort, and her wry observation to her hairdresser that \u201cI suppose there is a big difference between professional care and cutting my bangs with the same scissors I use to cut cardboard, right?\u201d"}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7036143-lynn", "userReview": "As in so many audiobooks, the narrator makes or breaks the story, thus the two stars. Might have been three if I had read a print copy. It was irritating to me because the southern accent was inconsistent. I realize that sometimes they were mimicking Livey, but sometimes it was hard to tell who was talking. It was not necessary to have the narrator sound like she was leaving the sound booth when the characters said, \"Hello!\" or \"I'll be down in a minute.\"Moving between the two eras, 1963 and 1999, worked well to connect the events, but it made me wonder if there weren't any other significant times during this family's life. I think Susan and Beth were a bit unrealistic. Too funny what she did with Tom's cologne and toothbrush (no spoilers here) but then her acceptance of his friendship seemed too easy, that he got what he wanted. Beth was a perfect 14-year old, and it seemed necessary or Susan could not have handled it.
