First a tough, working-class, London mom loses her bomb-squad husband and four-year-old son when terrorists bomb a packed soccer stadium, suffering injuries herself in attempting to find them immediately after the event. The unnamed narrator has to decide whether life is worth living. Her grief, and PTSD is manifest in hallucinations. She sees her dead son with increasing frequency and clarity as the story progresses. Chris Cleave - from The TelegraphHer life is complicated. She sees a well-to-do, but very confused and conflicted journalist who is smitten with her, then later a high-ranking cop with whom she works. She suffers an identity crisis, allowing herself to be re-shaped by others, trying on personae in attempting to figure out who she is after the trauma.Second, Cleave wrote this novel in a six-week marathon after the 2004 Madrid bombings, but before the 2005 bombings in London. Part of what he presents is his vision of how the UK might respond if faced with a major terrorist attack. We can look back from 2011 to see what he might have missed and what he got right.  It\u2019s an ugly war and there\u2019s no honour in it. But we will win because we have to. It\u2019s a war we win by ditching our principles. By interning people who are high risk. By listening to private phone calls.  The narrator offers counterpoints with sympathy for the Muslims she knows, hard-working people like herself, a danger to no one. Third is Cleave\u2019s portrayal of class in Britain. The book is filled with the tension of working-class people in almost alien worlds alongside their own. Examples abound  Tessa comes with rather a lot of baggage. Breeding. Family money. The people who have it aren\u2019t like you and me. They\u2019ll be polite enough to you. But try to get too close and they\u2019ll put back the distance. Try to step inside their circle and they\u2019ll close ranks. Us and them are not the same species. Don\u2019t make the same mistake I made. Don\u2019t ever get involved with the upper classes.While Cleave shines a bright light on class differences, he takes pains not to idealize anyone. London, post attack, puts up barrage balloons around the city, familiar from World War II, useful for forcing incoming aircraft to higher altitudes, their steel cables a disincentive to low-level flight. The balloons in this story bear the images of people lost in what is called the May Day attack.  They hadn\u2019t chosen very nice people for the balloons round Hyde Park anyway. The faces were mostly fat blokes who looked like they could tuck the pints away. They were the sort of blokes who\u2019d call each other by nicknames like oi Baz and oi Todger, and you could imagine them pinching your bum at a New Year\u2019s Eve party. Saying How about it darling? It was funny seeing those dead fat blokes 500 feet up in the air saving us from kamikazes. It might have been the first decent thing they\u2019d done in their lives most of them.There is a shortage of punctuation in the novel. It enhances Cleave\u2019s characterization of his narrator as a less than well-educated person. He even notes it, with a nod and a wink, when she is looking at a job possibility with the police. You might need to type up incident reports from time to time. They read like SUSPECT WAS APPREHENDED AT 0630 WIELDING A SHARPENED SPOON. That stuff needs commas like Covent Garden needs a gardener. Anyway we\u2019re not writing literature here. We\u2019re trying to stop people bombing people.The story takes place over the course of a year, with book sections for each of the seasons, as the narrator comes through a full cycle of change to arrive where she does at the end. The format is of a sort of epistolary novel. The narrator does not actually write letters to Osama bin Laden, but speaks as if she were, addressing him throughout her tale, decrying his actions, particularly sharing her pain at the loss of her son.This is a very engaging story. I was hooked from the first, and read it quite fast. I truly felt for this wounded mother. How would I feel if my mate and one or all of my children had been taken away so harshly? There are times in the book when one would be well-advised to keep the Kleenex handy. And there are others when Cleave gives us reason to laugh out loud. I have one significant gripe with the book. I thought Cleave went way too far with his ending. It seemed forced to me. But that aside, the journey, which makes up the bulk here, is very well worth the time. =============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author\u2019s personal, Twitter and FB pages"}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "UGH!! This is horrible! Trying to read it is like banging your head against a concrete pillar. You should only do it for the feeling of relief when you finally decide to stop.

This entire \"Dear Osama\" story is written in that obsessive fashion. Annoying details repeated ad nauseum. Her husband and son were killed in a London terrorist attack, and she has to tell you again and again that her son was \"4 years and 3 months old.\" Like that...The East End slang totally lost me. Include a glossary, for pity's sake. I don't want to jump up and visit urban dictionary every time I read something like \"on the khazi.\" WTF? I now know that \"khazi\" is British slang for toilet.

The grammar and punctuation is appaling, but it is totally in context. She relates, to Osama, all of the events and all of her feelings from immediately before the atrocity to many months afterwards. There is a lot of humour interspersed throughout the tragedy. One of the funniest passages that I have read recently will not spoil your enjoyment of this book.It didn\u2019t smell posh in Harvey Nichols it smelled of all the different perfumes in the world very strong and mixed up together. It felt like having your throat scraped. I took my boy into John Lewis once and it smelled just like that in the perfume section. Yuk Mummy he said. It smells nice and nasty all at once. It smells of angels' feet.Hilarious!I can understand why some people do not like this style of writing and cannot get into the book at all. This is a book that you will either love or hate. It is either one star or five stars plus plus. I cannot tell what it will be like for you, but I would recommend that you give it a chance.

And indeed it is not. The entire thing is written by the unnamed protagonist in a letter to Osama bin-Laden after al-Qaeda bombed a stadium during a big match, taking the lives of her husband and son. She tries to make a go of life afterwards, but while she never explicitly asks the question, it's embedded in every word: how does one regain one's own sanity when the entire world has gone crazy?The first, and perhaps biggest, thing to note here is that, as it's written as a letter, the entire book is in the voice of the protagonist, who is not terribly well-educated and eschews the use of commas. Twenty-five pages into this book, I was sure I was going to offer it up as a sacrifice to the gods of reading by lighting it on fire and tossing it into a random trash can, but I got used to the narrative style pretty quickly after that. Once you've fallen into the rhythm of the prose, the story itself is gripping-- our narrator is trying to get on with her life, just as England is, and the two are often compared to one another between the lines as a measuring stick, making sure we've got the idea in the back of our heads that the end of the book is a given. (And Cleave doesn't fail us, though we don't get exactly what we think we're going to.)

It's officially over for us. You are a man on a mission, a guy who tries to pass himself off as clever but is merely gimmicky, a man who attempts pathos and ends up mawkish. BLARGH. Here, in no particular order, are the things I can't stand in novels, in general, and applied to this one, in specific:1. Letters that magically, somehow, have perfectly remembered dialogues and long plot driven descriptions that no one would ever write.It's not only lazy but impossible to believe. The whole time I am reading I am distracted by the 'oh wait, right, this is a terror victim's letter to Osama (yank those heart strings! Yank yank!) so I better slap in the name Osama where it is least relevant so as to remind you folks at home that that is my gimmick! Smooth, Cleave.Which brings me to:2. Yanking heart strings novels.This falls into the category alongside Books About Kids With Cancer and Other Bad Diseases, Books About the Holocaust, and Books About Orphans. It's cheap, just like having a really long letter as your format. So of course how could I not feel for a woman who lost her son and husband to a senseless bombing, right? Except when the author tries REALLY REALLY hard to get you to feel that by employing all kinds of tricks. Also she was REALLY not likable. Which brings me to:3. Remembering that you need your characters to be multi dimensional so you add in some random not so ok behavior so you can pat yourself on the back.Said character has attitude, and not in a charming way. She represents the working class in London and you can all feel offended by this representation. Her smart mouth was annoying and her love for her family felt as forced as the times she did not feel that love, all the more dwarfed by the Big Catastrophe which brings me to:4. Books that Ride on the Coat Tails of Actual Tragedies so as to Beef Up Their Lousy Rendition of Same.Hello, Cleave? 9/11 called. It wants its sanctity back. He basically rips off the smoke and chaos of a real act of terror and attempts to draw upon that in his stupid football game bombing, and not only does it feel cheap and wrong, but he then turns this event (based on an actual event) into something resembling satire (ok yeah THAT'S a great idea) as in, \"Oh we can't be having Muslims working, even the ones who aren't religious. Well we can have the cab drivers but not anyone who might fly a plane.\" It's hard to put it exactly but as I was reading the \"unraveling of London\" as based on NYC part, it kept feeling like the lady in The Help who really, really wanted you to see how wrong everyone else was by exaggerating everything. I am not saying Muslims didn't get a lot of unfair backlash but I am saying that truth needs to read as truth, not your agenda driven attempt at getting me to react to something.I read about as much of this as I could, and at that point it was not only offensive but actually ridiculous with characters who were over the top such that nothing could be taken seriously.

Unfortunately, Chris Cleave left me disappointed. Unfortunately, Incendiary seems more like an outlandish dark daydream than anything real. For instance, she throws up on Prince William. Really? Really. I understand what Cleave was trying to do here, but no part of it seemed real. The entire time I thought I was reading some middle schooler's attempt to be a dark and gruesome author. With the middle schooler you pat him on the back, at least he's trying. But Cleave? How can I help but no roll my eyes. It wasn't believable. And in an age where terrorism is so real, this all just felt like some poorly feigned disaster. Besides for the story feeling incredibly fake, I also had a problem with the story's structure. This woman is drafting a note to Osama Bin Laden, and surely has never used a punctuation mark other than a period in her life. While some stories can benefit from a character's unique linguistic style, this was just distracting. And couldn't help but make me think- lazy.Now the overall concept was nice. Terrorism, loss, survival. I liked that aspect. I also really liked the character's guilt for the affair she was having while her family was dying- I wish that could have been played out more.

She is highly strung and suffers OCD due to the pressures of her husband\u2019s job. Her remedy for nerves is extra marital sex, whenever and wherever she can find it, while hubby is away diffusing bombs at all hours of the night. She falls in with Jasper, an upper-class journalist who is engaged to Petra, a dead ringer for our narrator in looks, but a ruthlessly ambition journalist in her own right. While our narrator is engaged in hard core sex with Jasper in her living room one afternoon, the blaring TV reveals the blowing up of the nearby stadium where her husband and four-year year-old son are attending the much heralded Arsenal-Chelsea soccer match. The guilt and the loss of loved ones during her act of transgression will never leave her. Nor does it seem to leave other Londoners exposed to the explosion. Everyone starts behaving badly. Rich boys take to cocaine, rich girls go shopping, and poor girls just try to get on with it, although they start seeing their dead relatives everywhere.Our narrator, in her grieving and addled state, next takes up with a police superintendent who was her dead husband\u2019s boss, and finds out that the explosion was a known one to the authorities, but it was allowed to happen in order to avert a much larger act of terrorism in London; preventing the soccer match explosion would have prematurely sent the perpetrators into hiding. This discovery leads to many conflicted emotions in our narrator: a sense of betrayal by her country\u2019s politicians, a sense of revulsion towards her new lover, and a craving for revenge to release the little ghost of the four-year old boy who is now following her everywhere. Things come to a head when Petra acts in her own self-centred way, and the cocaine-riddled Jasper decides to take matters into his shaky hands.The book is full of irony: the narrator\u2019s sexual climax coming just as the stadium explodes; the husband planning to transfer out of the bomb squad only to go out the day before to a soccer match and be killed by a bomb; the narrator falling in love with the superintendent only to find out that he has \u201cknown\u201d all along; the narrator aspiring for Petra\u2019s social standing as much as Petra seeks to emulate the narrator in order to win Jasper\u2019s affections; a bomb scare leading to deaths caused by various factors other than the exploding of bombs themselves; the blatant fact that civilized London and its denizens are no more civilized than the desert-hiding Osama and his gang\u2014it only takes a bomb and the breakdown of social order to reveal the similarities between the two civilizations.The style is epistolary and conversational: the narrator is having a conversation with Osama throughout the narrative. She doesn\u2019t hate him for what he has done to her family, but sees a kinship with him through her loss. In fact, she would like to live with Osama. She is a representation of London: \u201ca city built on the wreckage of itself, too ignorant to know when it is finished.\u201d All that said, it is hard to ignore the stark madness that these acts of terrorism reduce civilized society to, and our raving lunatic of a narrator remains a good example of that."}, {"userName": "Sheila", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2039269-sheila", "userReview": "I loved Chris Cleave\u2019s Little Bee, so when my husband learned that I was meeting a friend in a bookstore, he told me I should look for Cleave\u2019s first book Indendiary and see if I\u2019d like that too. So I looked.Pages of compliments to the author at the start of a book do tend to have a bad effect on me. By the time I\u2019d found the first page of writing, my bookstore coffee was cold. I almost wrote the novel off as artsy and not my style but then I stopped and read again. And I was thoroughly hooked.The novel starts as a letter: \u201cDear Osama.\u201d But the correspondent\u2019s no great politician, no stop-at-nothing soldier or truth-telling journalist, not even priest or a cleric, but rather a very ordinary Londoner mourning her dead boy and telling her tale.And what a tale. Incendiary is haunting, mesmerizing even. Yet, despite its topic, it\u2019s also laugh-out-loud funny. When a neighbor in the high-class Wellington Estate tells the woman he thinks she\u2019s \u201cvery real,\u201d she responds that no-one\u2019s ever said that before, probably because they thought it so \u201cbleeding obvious.\u201d But all the characters in this novel are heart-breakingly real, even Mr. Rabbit whose constant presence haunts and holds it together.Of course, I\u2019m English. There are places and names that I know as I sink into my chair and into the tale. I\u2019m comfortable. I recognize this voice. But suddenly that quiet world falls spectacularly and totally apart. The author goes where others might justifiably fear to tread and creates something powerfully terrifying and horribly plausible.Betrayal is such a simple word. We use it in so many ways. But one betrayal does not equal another, and Chris Cleave\u2019s novel has a depth and honesty that leaves the reader crying, not just for the dead boy, but for all the hopes and dreams that die in everyday betrayals, and for a world that might well be all too real, but really can\u2019t be trusted.Incendiary is a masterpiece, just like Little Bee, and highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Ammara Abid", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20790913-ammara-abid", "userReview": "One-sitting read!Very unique plot!A woman talking with Osama bin Ladin before & after the death of her husband and son and blaming him for the London attack but the reality was something else.

You stave off your anxieties about the uncertainty of your life through mindless sex encounters. Eventually, you meet a neighbor \u2013 a journalist named Jasper \u2013 and, while your husband and son are at a soccer game, you invite him to your flat. At the exact same time you are in the throes of sexual abandon, there\u2019s a massive terrorist bomb attack at the London soccer stadium, vaporizing over one thousand people \u2013 your husband and son among them. How do you go on? How do you live with the remorse?Chris Cleave explores that question in an epistolary structure; the nameless woman writes a letter to Osama bin Laden in the aftermath of the attack. The epistolary form is used with caution as a framing device (Nicole Krauss\u2019s The Great House and Moshid Hamid\u2019s The Reluctant Fundamentalist come to mind), because it is not easy to pull off. The reader is a fly-on-the-wall and can choose to connect with the narrator \u2013 or not. And if truth be known, Mr. Cleave is not entirely successful in his narrative control as the conceit of writing to Osama begins to wear thin.What he is successful with is developing a fragile persona \u2013 an obsessive woman who is gradually unraveling as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder and who is quickly spiraling downward. The anonymity of the character makes her everywoman, trying to survive in a post-terrorist world. The woman writes, \u201cBefore you bombed my boy Osama I always through an explosion was such a quick thing but now I know better. The flash is over very fast but the fire catches hold inside you and the noise never stops\u2026I live in an inferno where you could shiver with cold Osama. This life is a deafening roar but listen. You could hear a pin drop.\u201dThe bombing and PSTD, though, is only the beginning. London is quickly transformed into a virtual occupied territory as the woman fights her own inward battles. She is drawn into a psychological maelstrom with Jasper and his fianc\u00e9e, Petra, an upper-class fashion journalist who happens to resemble her closely. Indeed, Petra and the narrator may very well represent two parts of London, which is described as \u201ca smiling liar his front teeth are very nice but you can smell his back teeth rotten and stinking.\u201d Each cannot exist without the other. And so they enter a danse-a-deux of symbiosis and betrayal. Eventually, the novel veers toward a stunning denouement and an over-the-top ending.It\u2019s extraordinary ambitious for a first-time novelist (this book was written before Chris Cleave\u2019s more well-known Little Bee) and sometimes the prose comes across as rather self-congratulatory or forced. Mr. Cleave\u2019s intention, it seems, is to portray a decadent Western society that struggles to break free of its class distinctions \u2013 without success, setting itself up as something to tear down. Yet at the core of the novel, there is an emotional void. The characters are not quite satirical, yet not quite real. And as a result of the epistolary form, we, as readers, are held at arm\u2019s length, not quite embracing them.This often disturbing, sometimes macabre novel has its own intriguing history. The morning after its initial launch party, in July 0f 2005, three suicide bombers detonated their devices in the London Underground. The book tour was shelves and the novel was temporarily withdrawn from sale by many UK retailers. Sometimes, truth is stranger than fiction. And in Chris Cleave\u2019s world, fiction is very strange indeed.

This book just blew me away literally. It was one of those books that you love to hate but the realism, the pathos, the fear is brought out on every single page. Perhaps this book had such an impact because I am a native New Yorker who lived and worked a mere fifteen miles away from ground zero. I remember the panic, the sorrow, the intense feeling of both grief and despair as if that event occurred yesterday.The author has revived that feeling of intense loss and the way a mind can operate after such a loss. He has made it real again, though he does change the location, he does not change the way humanity reacts to the taking of innocent lives. Eerily true to life this book was released on the same day of the London bombings. I see many have hated this book. I think it is a scary, scary book, one that smacks the reader right in the headlights with the realism that terrorism in all its forms makes us into the kind of humans we were never destined to be, it causes women to lose husbands and sons, men to lose mothers and wives, and children, poor children to lose their innocence.While to conclusion of the book is unnerving, the understanding that there might be one sliver of goodness in a terrorist's heart may be its most redeeming quality. Can we ever forget or forgive those who have wantonly killed innocents because of their cause? Can the Bin Ladens of the world ever be more than the most despised people by those whose lives they have taken away? Can a mother ever forget this loss of her child?

I would tell you all about it but I don't want to ruin anything for you.The whole book is written as a letter to Osama from a woman whose husband and son were killed in a huge London bombing in which over 1,000 people died. They call it May Day (read: 9/11). If you think this sounds really maudlin - it isn't. It is sad, funny, real, true, and breathtaking. This is not some sob-your-heart-out dime novel. It's a deep, brutal, personal look at human nature and tragedy.The woman is flawed. She's not some perfect grieving widow and mother. Everyone in the book is flawed - and therefore three-dimensional and real. My heart was bleeding not only for her but for all the messed-up, suffering characters in this book who are just trying to get through life day by day. This book hits you where it hurts. It grabs you and doesn't let go.It's worth mentioning that there was no disconnect for me re: a male writing from a female's perspective.

The admittedly imperfect mother narrating this work in her singular, working-class, comma-phobic London voice grabs you by the gut. I didn't come up for air while reading this book. A fictional but eerily realistic terror attack rips through London and the life of one small family. The surviving mother writes a year-long letter to Osama bin Laden, addressing her anger, her loss, and her reactions (rational, intoxicated, or otherwise) as she watches her city become a high-surveillance police state and she tries to deal with a bottomless crater in her heart. There is dark humor and a masterly use of cultural touchstones and daily details that really transport the reader to this average life. The smell of the flat, the shopping for treats for a child, a boy's handmade bedroom are vivid against the explosive backdrop of this tragedy were almost too vivid and too poignant and I found myself unable to actually keep reading if my kids were in the room playing. The description of the sleeping boy smelling of tigers and angels. One of the things I really appreciated about this book and felt was most eye-opening was how much time Cleave spent exploring the class divide, and how the winners continue to win, even in a terror attack. There was great tension between the reactions of those personally benefitting from the brave new world and those grieving the old one.Chris Cleave came to our branch library in Seattle for a talk I attended this spring and he talked about how he wanted his novels to be a jumping-off place for discussion about the hard questions in our lives today: freedom vs. security, retribution, and the value of a life. His first novel certainly accomplishes this. Because the book was released simultaneously with the London bombings, the work was too uncomfortably raw and the fiction was eclipsed by reality. Approaching the 10th anniversary of 9/11, I found this struck the right tone for me to really reflect, remember, and develop a new empathy for those who have lost loved ones to terrorism."}, {"userName": "Ken Deshaies", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2709439-ken-deshaies", "userReview": "\"Incendiary\" is one of the best books I've read - ever. I also read Cleave's \"Little Bee\", as engaging a book as you want to pick up. However, this is different, both in style and content. Told through the voice of a lower class woman in London who is writing a letter to Osama Bin Laden after her husband and son were killed (along with hundreds of others) in an al-Qaeda suicide bomb attack at a soccer match. At the very moment of the explosion, the woman is not only having sex on her living room sofa with a local reporter she'd only recently met, but was also watching the match on TV and saw the explosion happen. Her successes and failures at dealing with that tragedy are visceral and real. You are inside her head always, and can easily sympathize with her reactions to situations. Cleave's ability to speak as a woman is extraordinary and makes even the male reader understand her reactions. Of course, she not only has to deal with the death of her two family members, but also with severe living restrictions put in place by the British and London governments following the attack. Just as the specter of 9-11 in America changed how we live in many ways, terrorism in London has had a similar, but perhaps more drastic affect on life there. It's truly a remarkable book, and I strongly encourage you to get it today. You won't be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Ele Munjeli", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2694246-ele-munjeli", "userReview": "This book took so much balls to write: the main character is woman, writing about motherhood, and wifehood, yet it was written by a man. The protagonist is working class; but the author graduated from Oxford. Above all, it's an exploration of a hideous crime, and the personal losses consequent, though this event never happened. The strength of the book lies in its enormous imagination. London after May Day is achingly detailed, Orwellian, but authentic due to intimate observation with the absurd politics of modern anti-terrorism. I lagged to read it, thinking I wasn't ever really in the mood for the topic; but once I picked it up, I gobbled it down in a day. Courage is absurd, and admirable even when it lodges in desperation and madness. The book entertained me, in spite of the violent and panicked imagery, because it relied on the only weapons effective against fear: understanding, creative thought, and love."}, {"userName": "Bronwen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1928965-bronwen", "userReview": "A gripping story.

Written before the horrific events of 7/7, author Chris Cleave paints a dystopian picture of London as we know it in the aftermath of a horrific al-Qeada bombing where 1000 men, women, and children were blown to bits as they enjoyed a day out at an Arsenal match. The story is told through the eyes of an average working class East End woman who loses her husband and son in the attack. Incendiary is a profound story of unbearable loss, and the sensitive yet unsoppy portrayal of a woman who loses her son in such conditions is a magnificent achievement in itself. But what I found most engaging was how the character navigates her way through the remade London which emerges from the ashes of the attack. It's a bleak London where life carries on but only under a debilitating blanket of fear - and it's all the more bleak because it rings so very true.This book imagines how both the government and the public would respond to such a devastating attack. The scenario is one of lock-down, in which the government loses all trust in the public and people have no faith in one another. Some of the Orwellian government measures do seem a bit far-festched, particuarly internment of Muslims, but others like increased surveillance and curfews, are not just within the realm of possibility but have actually been implemented by this and the previous government.The most disturbing aspect is the treatment of people by one another. Yes, there is an element of stiff upper lip, but lips become so stiff that mouths aren't used to talk with others. Most people retreat into isolated lives carried out alone or with families in flats, experiencing the outside world only through television.There is an amazing scene near the end when, faced with the threat of another imminent attack, 'the panic' takes hold. It is a slow descent into utter chaos, where people not only ignore pleas for help from their fellow Londoners but have no qualms about pushing others out of the way to save themselves. It shows what happens when the slow-burning, pent-up fear of life under the threat of terrorism suddenly erupts, and it's not a pretty sight.Cleave is right: today's Brits are not the self-same people who, faced with a blitz of aerial bombardment in the second world war, kept calm and carried on. 70 years of convenience, of cheap fatty foods and evening spent relaxing on sofas in front of mindless television, have done much to diminish that. One factor is the early disintegration of genuine communities, where neighbours are only people who happen to live near one another as opposed to united people making their lives together in a shared space. Mid-20th century Britain was a tough, sturdy nation - that strength has melted away into fat, and it's a depressing thought how this new sort of nation would respond under similar threat.That's what makes Cleave's book such a fantastic read: it demonstrates a deep and intimate understanding of modern Britain, and shows how that character would respond under extreme circumstances.Beyond the bounds of the book, however, are glimmers of a less depressing interpretation. When a real terrorist attack hit London (coincidentally on the same day Incendiary was published), although government pushed ahead with its programme to dismantle civil liberties, the people themselves did not respond with the lock-down mentality Cleave portrays. And when London descended into riots last summer, the real crowds on the streets - the true majority in every sense of the meaning - were those who came out afterwards with brooms and bins, determined to clean up their streets and reclaim their communities. Cleave has put his finger on a very real strain of the British character, but it's not the only real strain, and there is reason to believe the dystopian London of distrust and fear he paints does not lurk beneath the surface after all.Let's just hope we never have to find out."}, {"userName": "Pat Herndon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7221046-pat-herndon", "userReview": "I listened to the audiobook. The audiobook performance was superb, with the perfect reader to perform the material. I am sure that her reading enhanced my perception of the book...but. But, this plot line had some strange flaws in what I would otherwise describe as an excellent story. I read Little Bee and thought that it was an amazing work. Then I read Gold and thought, Chris Cleave does not understand female friendship. I was very pleased that this book was moving at an excellent pace..great setting, compelling descriptions of raw emotion, and a superb sense of time and place. But, Cleave soon delved into the subject of female friendship and bonding. I felt as though Chris Cleave had gone bonkers again, pulling the plot with him. The relationship that the two female characters develop is absurd. The circumstances under which they first meet defies any logic based on the characters themselves. Their contrived friendship had to occur some way for the plot to advance as it did, but couldn't the author have come up with a more plausible reason for them to be acquainted? Except for that matter, which was huge and very distracting to me, the book was excellent.

With a promising beginning, I was immediately intrigued with the heroine of the story writing a letter to Osama Bin Laden blaming him for the deaths of her husband and son in a terrorist attack at a soccer match. However, as it went on, I became less and less thrilled with this woman who was cheating on her husband while he was being killed and then loses her grip on reality and life.

These are definitely not fluff books and unfortunately some readers give them bad reviews based on the heaviness of the subject matter which I feel is unfair. It's like downgrading a children's book for being too simplistic. Or maybe a war novel because it's got violence and death.

Not only is it an insightful statement on an individual's grief for her family and nation, but it is also a poignant statement on that nation's grief. In many ways, we can look at the narrator's descent into madness as understandable, given her extreme losses. England, however, is made out like a just-chastised dog, tail between the legs and sulking in the corner. How does the country react? By growing mean and incapable of trusting others.But enough about that...\"Incendiary\" forces the reader to face questions that all of us should face in a post-9/11 world (though many of us can't bear the thought of doing so). Where is the line between civil liberties and security? Where is the appropriate threshold whereupon secrecy becomes necessary? Does force or resilience most-effectively deter terrorists?Perhaps the book's greatest success is how it explores what happens to \"regular\" folks in the aftermath of national tragedies. Too often we read about how our politicians are affected, how the families of the NYC firefighters were affected. The  New York Times  lists Guliani's and Bush's accounts as \"best sellers\". As mentioned, homeland security is a daily reality for me and I am afforded the opportunity to talk with a number of people about their emotions and their ideas about how to fight terrorism. One would be surprised at how many people teeter on madness when they really let themselves  feel  terrorism.The book explores a number of relevant social issues without being \"preachy\". It dissects how class stratification has manifested itself in modern, western civilizations. It touches on ethics in law enforcement and intelligence gathering. It ends with a scathing statement as to how our media can steal what little sanity many have left.

Cleaves at his best when he is writing dialogue. I would absolutely love for him to write a play. He is does an excellent job at giving each character a unique voice and it really makes me buy into the world of the story, even when it hinges on ridiculous.Like in his second novel, Cleaves makes some bold observations on human nature.

While the idea of a woman writing to the terrorist who engineered the deaths of her husband and son is intriguing, I found the protagonist unrealistic given the intellectual and moral gravity that the plot entails. It is entirely possible to make a character such as an unfaithful wife seem sympathetic and interesting, but I think Cleave misses the mark in this regard. Like many other novels that begin with tragedies, we as readers are thrust into a situation that is immediately demanding of us; we are put in a place where we must and should feel for the characters, but since the loss comes so near the beginning we do not know the characters enough to be able to relate to them or care. Even in the pages following the terrorist attack, the protagonist fails to develop much depth. She and the other characters are one-dimensional types. Even the style of narration draws attention to this shallowness of character by placing in caps the kind of stereotype that character represents.I usually don't skip ahead to the last pages of books, but this time I did and now, knowing generally where the story ends, I do not see, nor do I want to see, how the protagonist of this work comes to her conclusion."}], "description": "When a massive suicide bomb explodes at a London soccer match a woman loses both her four-year-old son and her husband.
