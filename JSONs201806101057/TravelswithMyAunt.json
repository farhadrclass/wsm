It tells us the entertaining story of Henry Pulling our very conservative, socially compliant, dull and boring erstwhile bank manager of some years standing. Henry encounters the eponymous \u2018Aunt\u2019 \u2013 Augusta for the first time in 50 years and as the title suggests, almost involuntarily, embarks on said \u2018travels\u2019.So whilst at first glance \u2018Travels with my Aunt\u2019 is ostensibly not as profound nor in the same league as Greene\u2019s classics (Power and the Glory, Heart of the Matter, End of the Affair etc) \u2013 it is a very much a different kind of novel. But don\u2019t be fooled by this veneer of a seemingly light-hearted and superficial fun story \u2013 there meaning here too.Amusing and entertaining though this novel is (being one of Greene\u2019s so-called \u2018entertainments\u2019 rather than serious novels) \u2013 as it comes from the pen of Graham Greene, there is of course a serious nature and undertone to the story. There is much here about the dullness and self-imposed imprisonment of suburban domestic life \u2013 focussing on this aspect of an imprisoning effect, being happy yet bored, successful yet uninspired, an absence or suppression of any sense of adventure. What is painted here is very much a middle England, middle class, middle brow, middle management existence \u2013 certainly as the starting point and impetuous for our forthcoming adventure.As with all of Greene\u2019s work, \u2018Travels with my Aunt\u2019 is expertly executed from start to finish \u2013 Greene is very much a solid and reliable, as well as brilliant, writer. Both Aunt Augusta and Henry Pulling are so very well created and drawn and when it all comes down to it \u2013 don\u2019t we all secretly wish for our very own Aunt Augusta and a series of perplexing but exciting and life changing adventures to call our own? It that sense at least, it is not just Henry who is escaping here \u2013 it is the reader also who, as with the best of novels, is on a real journey of escapism and discovery here."}, {"userName": "umberto", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2580971-umberto", "userReview": "Since some years ago I\u2019ve tried to read this seemingly readable \u201cTravels With My Aunt\u201d but it\u2019s a pity I could read no more than 8-10 pages and left it on its stack, more than once. So last month I decided to read it hoping to enjoy this fiction like his six ones, I\u2019ve found his \u2018intoxicating entertainment\u2019 (GR synopsis) amazing and worth spending my time. Like I said somewhere, I started by reading its brief synopsis as an essential overview as well as the one from Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travels... for more detail.The story is about a middle-aged retired bank manager named Henry Pulling, he has just met Aunt Augusta for the first time in fifty years at his mother's funeral. His aunt, in her seventies, is a formidable character fond of Henry and action, she simply plans her itinerary abroad with a bit of adventure in mind, rather than mope and stay home; therefore, Henry has no choice but follows her plan by keeping going and solving problems from some unexpected plights or weird people along the way.Surprisingly, I found reading this reluctantly long-awaited book inimitably hilarious with wonderful dialogs, fantastic plot, unthinkable climax, etc. Moreover, each reasonably manageable length of each chapter is not too tedious for us as his admirers or newcomers. There are 20 chapters in Part One and only 8 in Part Two; we may call such a chapter as a numerical one because we see only Numbers 1 (4+pages), 2 (3+), 3 (8), \u2026. 20 (6+) and Numbers 1 (10+pages), 2 (4), 3 (11), \u2026 8 (8).Once in a while, I have sometime found some words used in the right context and wondered if this is one of the ways in which Greene has told us that he regards writing some of his novels as a sort of 'entertainment' that implies reading entertainment for us as well, for example:1. It was a sad occasion without Sir Alfred, who had been a very jovial man, laughing immoderately even at his own jokes. (p. 22)2. 'How was the mowing-machine by the way?' 'Very wet, but no irreparable damage.' (p. 24)3. 'I told Jo what the doctor said, and he mouthed a reply, I thought I made out, ''not good enough.'' (p. 56)4. 'Does he speak English or French?' 'It is not likely.' I felt hopelessly abroad. (p. 91)5. So I sat in the West Berlin Hotel shedding beery tears of self-pity and envying the men who danced with their arms round strangers' shoulders. (p. 124)If you notice something uniquely well-expressed in each item, you'd see the point and agree with me on the following: immoderately, irreparable, mouthed, hopelessly abroad, and beery. What do you think?Moreover, Greene has Wordsworth, a key character, speak his transcribed pidgin English which is of course literally amusing whenever we hear the typical dialog or we speak it mockingly. Try reading the extracts and you'd see why:'\u00ddour auntie, Mr Pullen. She allays safe with old Wordsworth. Ar no cost her nothing. But she got a fellah now -- he cost her plenty plenty. And he too old for her, Mr Pullen. Your auntie no chicken. She need a young fellah.''You aren't exactly young yourself, Wordsworth.''Ar no got ma big feet in no tomb, Mr Pullen, lak that one. Ar no trust that fellah. ...' (p. 208)'Who is this man she's with, Wordsworth?''I won spik his name. My tongue turn up if I spik his name. Oh, man, I bin faithful to your auntie long time now.'... (p. 208)'He was asking me about you. He saw us on shore.''What he look lak?'... (p. 209)Incidentally, touched by his mention of 'Thailand' in this book rather than 'Siam' as found in his memoir, I think first it's a kind of honor to see him write/type our country to the world to see and probably those people unfamiliar with or rarely heard of our country may find out in a reference or at Wikipedia, and second it's due to its first publication in 1969 so 'Thailand' has been widely heard and more accepted in telecommunications, journalism, business, etc. internationally. The mention in question is as follows:'You've been out here for six years?''No, but I was in Thailand before this.''Doing research?''Yeah. Sort of ...' ... (p. 204)Again, when I casually read this sentence, \"The great gates had been cleaned of rust and flung open; the chandeliers sparkled in the sala, lights were turned on in even the empty room, ...\" (p. 254) The word 'sala' (in italics) rang a bell and kept me wondering if it comes from a foreign or a Thai word ; so I tried Wiktionary and found two meanings: 1. From Spanish, from Germanic; ... A large hall or reception room.2. Borrowing from Thai \u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e32 (saa-la). An open pavilion in Thailand used as a meeting place or to shelter from the weather.[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sala] I have no further information on his 'sala' used in the sentence so it might have been from either one."}, {"userName": "Mariel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647547-mariel", "userReview": "Travels with My Aunt was my first Graham Greene (films don't count! Or do they?) . I didn't know which to choose because I didn't have internet access at the time of the big moment. The jacket said it was the only book that Greene ever wrote for the fun of it. Maybe he had fun. I sure as heck didn't. Maybe it was the times (publication date is 1969) ... An old woman who proclaims way too loudly that she's having a great time to make her cliche of a stiff upper lip Englishman nephew feel more befuddled than Hugh Grant at the height of his befuddled niche as the go-to guy for befuddled Englishmen in postcard English life films. Maybe I'm in a bad mood and this was funny in 1969. I thought that it was trying too hard to have fun. Henry didn't know how to have fun and Aunt Augusta is the aging bar slut who brags about what a crazy wild night she had fifteen years ago. I can't stand that type. Have fun while you are having it. No, I don't want to see photos of you getting drunk last week on your myspace or facebook. I was sooooo bored. I didn't care about anything that happened. Their travels were more boring than the most boring part of travels (the traveling part and not the getting somewhere part). There's a tacked on murder that came too late to be interesting. By that time I was desperate for the book to be over. Then he gets together with a flipping fifteen year old and they read religious passages from Browning. Why go through all of that just to creep me out? If he was dissatisfied with his life why not learn about women by hanging out with one who is not in her seventies and related to him? How come Aunt Augusta liked to talk about having fun so much? Talk, talk, talk. Could Greene have been having that much fun if he wanted to fit in so badly? All of those drugs and swinging parties? The Coleridge joke about the manservant Wordsworth was also painfully obvious. Okay, now that I've read Pnin by Nabokov that has a complimentary quote by Greene on the book jacket I feel guilty trashing this book. It's kinda sad to try desperately to have fun and not be in on the joke. That doesn't mean I don't find the memory of this book boring as waiting (I hate waiting). At least it makes the whole process seem like an exercise in fun and less than preachy Aunt Augusta and her high wheeling life.

It is a fictitious account of Henry Pulling a never-married bachelor in his fifties whose greatest adventure has been creating accounts for wealthy clients at his bank. He has now retired and enjoys quiet days cultivating his precious dahlias. Then his aunt arrives on the scene.It starts at the funeral of his mother. While Pulling is sitting there in the crematorium funeral parlor considering his mother's life and also his father's he hears a voice behind him say, \"I once attended a premature cremation.\"Thus is his introduction to his Aunt Augusta, his mother's sister.With no more introduction than that, Henry finds himself sucked into the drama of this aunt he has never before met. The second thing she informs him of (the first being the crematorium incident; as a child she accidentally pushed a button which set the coffin off, but luckily when the others arrived for the service, no one realized the body was no longer there) is that his mother was not his biological mother she was just the person who married his father (who was his biological father) and raised him as his own.The story then proceeds to bounce back between hilarity and absurdity.Aunt Augusta is quite a woman. Or a trollope, depending on your point of view. She has known quite a few men in her seventy odd years and is not slowing down any time soon. She is currently living with a man, Wordsworth, from an African country-quite shocking since this was published in 1970- and he's half her age. But before Wordsworth, she lived in Paris with a married man, and before that in Istanbul with a general Abdul and before that with an Italian Visconti and I almost forgot Currin, the priest of the Dog church back in a small English town.Pulling just wants to stay home with his dahlias but Aunt Augusta propels him across Europe because, it turns out, she is smuggling money and needs his help. He helps but not intentionally. Only later does he find out what she's carrying in all those heavy suitcases.Greene is a brilliant writer and very, very witty. But he also demonstrates how evil looks interesting in fiction when it is actually boring in real life.We find out that Aunt Augusta has all these lovers because she financially supplies them with her wealth. She's not stupid. She knows that is why they love her and when her money runs out, they leave her. She loves them all the more for that. She tells her nephew that she could not love a man who loved her back. Emotional need is too much of a claim on one's soul.It reminds me of the socially awkward kid at school who tries to buy friends with his lunch money. How is one exactly satisfied with that? The whole thing seems a sham.But that is not how Greene presents it. Aunt Augusta is the exciting one. Pulling is the boring one because he wants a normal secure life.Aunt Augusta breaks a lot of laws for the sake of her lovers and she finally ends up in Paraguay back with Visconti whom we're supposed to believe is the real love of her life. Well, as long as that smuggling business stays profitable.Another thing. The woman who raised Pulling is presented as a narrow-minded prig of a person and it turns out that SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! Aunt Augusta is not really is aunt, but rather his mother. This is never explicitly stated but we're to gather that from the clues strewn throughout the story.Excuse me, but I have to applaud the woman who raised Henry, not the woman who deserted him to traipse across the world buying criminally-minded men's love.But I suppose we're not really supposed to take any of it seriously. In which case it is nothing more than a well-written silly story."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1895570-jim", "userReview": "Somehow I thought this book was going to be a lighthearted romp. Funny it was, but in a sad, meditative way as Henry Pulling comes under the influence of his Aunt Augusta Bertram. I should have known better: Graham Greene is not the romping type. That takes a particular kind of character, one which does not look at life with the calm grey eyes of the author of The Heart of the Matter and The Burnt-Out Case.Travels With My Aunt is a delightful book -- one that could easily have gone off in several other directions. But it didn't: With his aunt, Henry has found a family to replace the one he lost; and, with her, he has found the attractive teenage daughter of a Paraguayan customs official.I like to remember the late Mr Pottifer's idea of immortality:I think the reason lay partly in his idea of immortality, but I think too it belonged to his war against the Inland Revenue. He was a great believer in delaying tactics. \"Never answer all their questions,\" he would say. \"Make them write again. And be ambiguous. You can always decide what you mean later according to circumstances. The bigger the file the bigger the work. Personnel frequently change. A newcomer has to start looking at the file from the beginning. Office space is limited. In the end it's easier for them to give in.\"The way that Greene plants the Pottifer story in the novel gives it a unique significance. Check it out when you read the book: I don't want to give the author's secret away. I have too much respect for him."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "[Interpol, smuggling, art theft and counterfeit are on display here!

Curran was more alive than I was. I was almost surprised to see that my image was visible in the glass.\"So says Henry Pulling, a retired English bank manager who has lived life so prudently, safely, carefully and boringly that he comes to realize that he has left no consequential living memory in anyone he's ever met. His favorite thing in all the world is tending to his dahlia flower garden and reading dusty volumes of Wordsworth and Sir Walter Scott. When his mother dies, Pulling is suddenly clued in to a lot of realities about who he really is and what his family was really up to, thanks to a long-absent ebulliant aunt, Augusta, who brings Henry up to speed on a good number of the facts of life that the naive naif nephew seems to have missed. Aunt Augusta herself has been long absent because she's been spending her life traveling Europe, living and loving and losing with brio, and becoming entangled in romances and petty criminality, some of which may be fancifully embellished in the retelling to Henry. She whisks Henry off on various travels, and during their course, dull Henry starts to regret the wasted opportunities of his life.Greene generally classed his books broadly into two categories: serious novels and what he coined \"entertainments.\" This one blends elements of both, weaving an eccentric whimsical tale with dark undertones into a typical Greene story of Anglos entwined in espionage, smuggling and foreign intrigue in Third World countries. One thing that's always interesting about Greene's novels is the timelessness of his political observations; nothing much changes even if the surface issues and names do. There's even a fictional shell corporation mentioned that sounds prophetically like Enron. As usual, Greene casts a bemused observational eye on the strange bedfellows borne of corruption and amorphous morality operating within systems, politics, ideologies. As usual, Catholicism (and other religions) enter the mix and come in for genteel digs.Though this book might be considered lightweight and trivial Greene to some degree, it accumulates in relevance as it proceeds, building a palpable gravitas. The book is very meticulous and slow; some might rebel in the face of its sometimes Jamesian precision of descriptive detail. The book plods a bit and seems to not have a plot, but there is one; it's just not rushed and is always hinted at with tiny clues along the way. The main point of the book, though, is about how people choose to live their lives, and it's that point of contrast that Greene explores in themes and variations. In some ways, it seems almost too simplistic to make the contrast with such obviously diametrically opposed characters; Pulling does seem too boring to be real. But as it proceeds his character takes on dimension, and the contrast between he and his Aunt provide much food for thought. Aunt Augusta, like Henry, is a literary construct, no doubt, but she's a fun one, speaking the Queen's English but letting shocking (to Henry) revelations pour from her seemingly proper old tongue.The humor and situations at the outset of the book seem fidgety and forced, one senses Greene trying to outdo Waugh and Wodehouse and failing, but eventually the charms emerge and there are a few genuine laughs and crazy situations and characters, such as the cremation urn used for drug smuggling and the CIA man who keeps a meticulous daily diary of his urine output.This novel's parts are better than the whole, and I have to admit that I found this to be my least favorite Greene book thus far (*2011 addendum: I would now say Loser Takes All is my least favorite GG). Yet, I think it's a better book than I'm giving it credit for; it covers a lot of ground and at the end is quite poetic. There's a major revelation in the last pages that was telegraphed long before and that's how I'd already suspected that that's where the book was going. The novel is a bit of an oddity and will not be everyone's cup of tea and it's definitely NOT the place to start to engage the work of Graham Greene, but readers familiar with his motifs and style will find it strong on observation, occasionally delightful and a worthwhile example of his eclectism."}, {"userName": "Lyn Elliott", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott", "userReview": "Read years ago and it still stands out as very, very funny.

The characters were great--this is an example of how if you can write great characters, a reader will stay loyal to your novel out of a pure desire to follow them for hundreds of pages. But the plot was sort of lacking (I skipped entire chapters out of impatience with the slowgoing plot and was able to move forward without being lost). And there were coincidences galore (one character pops up at the most convenient moments only to exit very conveniently as well...and people are coincidentally related to each other--and I won't reveal who/how). But still worth a read, though not Greene's best--this is an example of how brilliant prose and great characters can overcome shortcomings (like an overabundance of convenient coincidences).

It seems Aunt Augusta was something of the black sheep of the family, her distinctly racy and unconventional lifestyle making her unwelcome. But Henry finds himself drawn towards her, her frank stories of a life full of incident providing a contrast to his own rather dull and lonely existence as a retired bank manager in the respectable little community of Southwood. And soon Augusta entices Henry to join her on some of her journeys, first on the Orient Express to Istanbul and later to South America.This is a gentle little comedy without any of the profundity of Greene's major works but still with a certain amount of charm. Published in 1969, at a time when Greene was in his mid-60s, it does rather read like a tolerant older man's view of the 'permissive' society of the '60s, with its focus on 'free love' and incessant pot-smoking. However, through Aunt Augusta's stories, we are also taken on a light trip back through the century, though her storytelling technique makes it hard to pin down the truth of any event she is describing. From running a church for dogs in Brighton to her rather seedy career in France, from possibly having something to do with the Resistance to consorting with Nazi war criminals, Augusta's exuberant zest for life manages somehow to overcome Henry's normal repugnance for anything not quite respectable. The lesson he must learn from Augusta is the simple one that there is a difference between the tedium of merely existing and the joy of experiencing life.\nI went restlessly out and crossed the little garden where an American couple (from the St James or the Albany) were having tea. One of them was raising a little bag, like a drowned animal, from his cup at the end of a cord. At that distressing sight I felt very far away from England, and it was with a pang that I realized how much I was likely to miss Southwood and the dahlias in the company of Aunt Augusta.\nThe writing is, of course, excellent, especially the stories of their travels and the various places they pass through. It's not a travelogue, so there are no tourist brochure style descriptions \u2013 instead, it's a vague, impressionistic picture of the process of travelling and the places passed by as seen through Henry's untutored, and often uninterested, eye. The reader is more likely to be told about the availability of ham sandwiches than the great architecture of a given town. This changes a little when they head off to South America \u2013 in this section, we begin to get a much clearer picture both of the natural world and the strange and rather corrupt society Henry finds himself sucked into.\nWhen a train pulls into a great city I am reminded of the closing moments of an overture. All the rural and urban themes of our long journey were picked up again: a factory was followed by a meadow, a patch of autostrada by a country road, a gas-works by a modern church: the houses began to tread on each other's heels, advertisements for Fiat cars swarmed closer together, the conductor who had brought breakfast passed, working intensely down the corridor to rouse some important passenger, the last fields were squeezed out and at last there were only houses, houses, houses, and Milano, flashed the signs, Milano.\nThe humour runs at a consistently gentle level throughout, never becoming riotously funny, but never getting lost either. Unfortunately a good deal of the humour is centred on Aunt Augusta's younger lover, Wordsworth, a man from Sierra Leone, and to modern eyes his portrayal feels horribly stereotyped at best and somewhat racist at worst. In fact, given Greene's age and the time of writing, Wordsworth is actually rather affectionately portrayed \u2013 indeed, he's about the only likeable character, the only one with a true, warm and generous heart. But still, I found some of the dialect and his rather childish naivety made for pretty uncomfortable reading in places. Otherwise, however, the contrast between Henry's buttoned-up mentality and Augusta's free-wheeling acceptance of all life has to offer gives plenty of opportunity for Greene to quietly mock the society of the time.\nThe vicar was saying clearly, while the congregation buzzed ambiguously to disguise the fact that they had forgotten the words: \u201cWe acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness, which we, from time to time, have committed...\u201d I noticed that the detective-sergeant, perhaps from professional prudence, did not join in this plea of guilty. \u201cWe do earnestly repent, and are heartily sorry for these our misdoings...\u201d I had never before noticed how the prayer sounded like the words of an old lag addressing the Bench with a plea for mercy. The presence of Detective Sergeant Sparrow seemed to alter the whole tone of the service.\nThis would not be the book I would recommend to people wanting to sample Greene for the first time. Much better to try one of his more serious novels where the depth of the subject matter tends to withstand dating a little better. In truth, I think profundity suits his style better than humour. But, overall, I found this a pleasurable if rather light read \u2013 one where the journey is more enjoyable perhaps than the destination.www.fictionfanblog.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul", "userReview": "Henry Pulling is just a little bit dull.

Henery is starting to learn that he Aunt is not always the conventional type, and seems to have had many dodgy dealings and associations. They are soon deported back to the UK.Back in the UK, Henry returns to his dahlias, but it now doesn\u2019t have the same appeal. The police are asking more question about his aunt too, and one of her former associates, but she has vanished of the face of the earth. Until one day he receives a letter asking him to come to South America, so he sets off to join her once again. It was quite an enjoyable read. Green has managed to blend a mystery story with travel, a dash of thriller with a healthy dollop of classic British farce. The characters are not particularly deep, but you do see Henry develop from the staid, and serious bank manager to a free spirited man. It was very readable too; Green has a way of pacing the story so you don\u2019t get bored. It was a touch predictable, but entertaining nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Emanuel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12490304-emanuel", "userReview": "Este livro deveria ter um aviso na capa alertando o leitor para os perigos do seu sentido de humor.

I felt hopelessly abroad.\nThe book is unequally divided in two parts, the first taking up most of it. I will have to separate them in my review, for they inspired very different feelings.The Good Stuff (about Part 1)\n\"You must surrender yourself first to extravagance\"\n- it is well written, as you expect a classic work of literature to be;- it was funny, even outrageous and surprising at times, in a way I didn't expect a classic work of literature to be;- Aunt Augusta's character;- the message.\n\"A long life is not a question of years. A man without memories might reach the age of a hundred and feel that his life had been a very brief one.\"\"I was afraid of burglars and Indian thugs and snakes and fires and Jack the Ripper, when I should have been afraid of thirty years in a bank and a take-over bid and a premature retirement.\"\n\"Travels with my Aunt\" is a story of empowerment. It urges you shed boredom and just do stuff, go places. It inspires to question the sense of moral superiority which often comes with following the rules:\n\"Perhaps a sense of morality is the sad compensation we learn to enjoy, like a remission for good conduct\"\nI can't say I agree that is always the case, but it definitely is sometimes. We often choose to interpret our fear, laziness, inertia and perpetual boredom as moral superiority, loyalty and a will of iron, where there is none of that.Aunt Augusta's character in Part 1 can be summed up by these few lines:\n'I hope you don't plan anything illegal.''I have never planned anything illegal in my life', Aunt Augusta said. 'How could I plan anything of the kind when I have never read any of the laws and have no idea what they are?'\nAunt Augusta is a 75-y.o. lady and a spitfire. She is straightforward and honest, she loves life and she loves people. She is unashamed to state, that at her age, yes, she still falls in love and enjoys a sex life. I'm so used to seeing old people portrayed as either adorable-lost-featherhead knitting in the background, or as a cranky old fuck, or as a quintessence of faceless wisdom. Aunt Augusta is flesh and blood, and that was refreshing. Her honest, judgement-free view on other people around her was nice to read. She has her faults, for sure, but I agreed with Henry here:\n\"Loyalty to a person inevitably entails loyalty to all the imperfections of a human being, even to the chicanery and immorality from which my aunt was not entirely free.\"\nThe Bad Stuff (about Part 1)- it was slow at times, and I found myself zoning out;- Henry's character.Henry is best described here: \"As I went upstairs to bed I felt myself to be a ghost returning home, transparent as water.\" He's over 55, doesn't have any friends, lovers, interests, skills or a job or anything at all in his life. The man has never been in a relationship (romantic or just close kinship), has never been excited about ANYTHING! He studied, and after graduation his mom found him a clerking job, which he held for over 30 years, now he has retired, and that's it! All he does is gardening and reading a few of the same books back to back over and over. I can't imagine someone really having such an empty life, such a total lack of personality, ambition, will. This story is supposed to be about his journey to becoming a real person, of his empowerment, but in fact he just continues with the same thing:\"It was as though I had escaped from an open prison, had been snatched away, provided with a rope ladder and a waiting car, into my aunts world, the world of unexpected character and the unforeseen event\"Again, he just goes with the drift of things, the drift being Aunt Augusta, he makes no decisions of his own, just, as always, follows along and pretends that's what he wants.The Good Stuff (about Part 2)None found.The Bad Stuff (about Part 2) **Spoilery**The first part wasn't exactly perfect, but it was good, but it all went to shit in Part 2.Aunt Augusta disappointed me so badly, it was as if her whole strength was eliminated. She is head over heels in love with this guy - they've been together before, in their youth. The man is described as \"short and fat and bald\" - I appreciate the fact that he wasn't an 80-y.o. with a six pack. YES, being old and not beautiful does not render you unlovable. So, she loves him. But he so obviously doesn't love her back, uses her, etc. And he's done it before. Their relationship years ago ended on him robbing her blind! \"- So you gave him money the second time, Aunt Augusta?-Of course, what did you expect? He needed it.\"'You have forgotten glasses.' I watched Aunt Augusta with fascination. I have never seen her taking orders from anyone before.\"DAFAQ?! Aunt Augusta is supposed to be this devil-may-care strong woman, femme fatale even, but in Part 2 she just loses all self-respect and allows herself to become a doormat. Although, to be fair, if we recall the stories she told about her romantic history with other guys - she has been there before, too. Like, with that married guy she loved, then found out she was his second mistress, then he dumped her, and she begged him to continue fucking her once a week, being third in line. UGH.The author seems to romanticize females being doormats: \"Not many men have been so loved or have been forgiven so much.\" Um. Let's see. So they used to be together. He dumped her and robbed her of a fortune. She went on living, and then decades later she gets a letter from him, asking her to participate in illegal activity and giving him all the money she has. What does she do? Drops everything, travels half the world over to bring him everything in her teeth and virtually becomes his servant. WOW! And that is presented to us as an example of super-love, selflessness, kindness, forgiveness. Ahem. When someone robs you, then asks for more, and you give it - that's not forgiveness. The perpetrator didn't ask for forgiveness, doesn't think he did anything wrong at all, and you affirm that. UGHHHHH I was sooooooooooo riled by this whole storyline I was on the verge of screaming at my book.Aunt Augusta continues spewing evil bullshit:\"I've never wanted a man who needed me, Henry\"\"I need a man who is untouchable. Two touchables together, what a terrible life they always make of it, two people suffering, afraid to speak, afraid to act, afraid of hurting. Life can be bearable when it's only one who suffers. It's easy to put up with your own suffering, but not someone else's. I'm not afraid of making Mr Visconti suffer. I wouldn't know how. I have a wonderful feeling of freedom. I can say what I like and it will never get under that thick dago skin of his\"Okay, lady! Don't parade your emotional dependence on this guy as liberty. Oh, you're not afraid of offending him, because he doesn't care? Well, you can't make him happy either, for the same reason. Can't love a good guy, who loves you? That's your problem if you like pining after someone who doesn't give a fuck, but don't paint the rest of the world as a bunch of suffering people. Caring for one another is about HAPPINESS, not misery. It doesn't make one fearful or weak. You become stronger and you share that strength with the loved one.There were a few bullshitty details for which I don't understand the purpose in this book. Like the illiterate servant who perfectly forged a valuable painting and put his initials on it. Henry meeting O'Toole in Paraguay - who is a CIA agent and the father of Tooley - the girl they briefly met on a train in Europe. Like, how likely is that? I would have bought it if Tooley was sorta spying on them... But no. Supposedly, it was pure coincidence. And O'Toole believes they were friends - for no reason whatsoever.The predictable twist that Augusta is actually Henry's mom, not aunt. Totally saw it coming.By the end of the book there appeared bizarre poetry quotations on virtually every page. I didn't get them, their purpose there, it was just stupid.The worst was the conclusion to it all. Henry becomes the henchman of the guy Augusta \"loves\". Again, none of that is his decision, so the supposed emancipation is a total failure. As always, Henry just goes where others take him. So he smuggles drugs for that guy. That's presented as liberation. And he becomes engaged to a 14-year old girl, to marry her at the age of 16. He's close to 60 at that point! And the book takes place somewhere around 1960s, so it's not like it was normal at the time. DAFAQ?!Why do books about personal liberation have to create a conflict between law and freedom? The opposite of boredom is interest. You don't need to participate in an orgy to be an interesting person. You don't need to turn an aging bank clerk into a drug smuggler! Just give him a few hobbies, a friend, let him take responsibility for his own life, be an active participant in it, not a log being hurled downstream in a river.UGHHH"}, {"userName": "Philip", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1391890-philip", "userReview": "Henry Pulling is a recently retired bank manager. He was offered an arrangement after many years of devoted service when his bank was taken over by another. He is looking forward to spending more time with the dahlias that are his pride and joy, and also rubbing shoulders with his former customers in Southwood, an unremarkable London suburb that seems to be populated entirely by retired officers from the armed forces. He mentions Omo quite a lot and is vaguely embarrassed by the fact that he shares initials with a well known brand of sauce. And then he meets his long lost aunt, Agatha Bertram.Henry\u2019s mother has just died. His father died forty years before. He never really knew the father and his relationship with his mother was perennially tense. After the funeral, Agatha takes him on one side and calmly informs him that his father was something of a rogue and that his \u201cmother\u201d was really his step-mother, his true biological mother being one of his father\u2019s bits on the side. Henry Pulling finds himself attracted to his aunt, not because she is something of an eccentric, unpredictable old bird, but also because she retains, somewhere, the secret of his own origins. When she suggests they travel together, he eagerly accompanies, despite the fact that he has never been one for straying far from the nest.Graham Greene has Henry and Aunt Agatha travel as far afield as Brighton, Istanbul and South America. Together, via stories from Aunt Agatha\u2019s past, they relive the first half of the twentieth century, from late Victorian roots to 1960s drug culture, from fascism to dictators, from war to peace. Throughout, Henry Pulling comes across as a genial, predictable gent in his late fifties, whilst Aunt Agatha seems to be a confirmed member of Hell\u2019s Grannies. Europe \u2013 the world even \u2013 seems to be littered with her conquests, with hardly a country passing by without some faded memory of hers coming back to life.As it unfolds, Travels With My Aunt reveals itself as a true masterpiece of twentieth century fiction. The characters really do live through the century\u2019s history, but the events are never pressed onto the surface of their lives. On the contrary, they are entwined within the fabric of Aunt Agatha\u2019s being, a character whose complexity unfolds as the story progresses.Throughout Henry Pulling is a truly comic character. He seems out of his depth, na\u00efve, a product of an over-protected suburban existence, over-burdened with the assumptions of his upbringing. But he comes into his own and eventually it is no surprise when he describes his new life, which is almost as far removed from a suburban bank manager\u2019s office as it is possible to get. And, of course, the story\u2019s denouement, when it arrives, is also no surprise. And is not less because of that.There are many laughs along the way, not least as a result of Henry\u2019s being constantly taken aback by his aunt\u2019s bluntness and lust for life. Particularly memorable, however, were scenes where Henry put his personal foot in it. On Paraguay\u2019s national day, he carries a red scarf on his aunt\u2019s advice so he can show allegiance to the ruling party and the dictator. He just happens to be outside the military and political headquarters when he sneezes and uses the scarf as a hankie. A nearby soldier records the snotting into the national emblem as deeply insulting and irreverent, duly beats him up and slaps him in jail. Situation comedy at its best.Travels With My Aunt is quite simply a must read and must re-read book. Graham Greene\u2019s immense skill provides a simplicity of style and construction to communicate a complex plot alongside powerful characterisation, and all this accomplished with true but elegant economy. It is a beautifully crafted book, expertly written, full of surprises and humour, all set against a deadly serious plot: surely a masterpiece."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5894339-greg", "userReview": "Travels With My AuntAunt Augusta (Miss Bertram)Henry Pulling (Mr. Pullen)Wordsworth (Zachary)Sir Alfred KeeneMiss Barbara Keene (Sir Alfred's daughter)Detective-Sergeant John SparrowHattyJo (bookmaker, Henry's uncle)Angelica (Henry's mother)Mr. ViscontiMajor Charge (Henry's neighbour)Tooley.

When I told her it was Graham Greene's Travels with my Aunt she was ebullient, while our other friend said, \"I will never read another book by THAT man.\" The three of us had all read Journeys without Maps together. My fellow G. G. fan declared she must, just must read The Quiet American. I backed her up with acclaim for The Heart of the Matter, which I said was my favorite. When I started thinking though, I remembered The Third Man, and then Then End of the Affair. All are such very different books. A reader who writes Green off after one book is writing off several different writers. Unlike his contemporary, the other Green, Henry who was wildly original in his mode, but very consistent, Graham Greene has several modes. He acknowledged this when he said he wrote two kinds of books, \"entertainments\" and more serious literature. Travels falls, not squarely, but more so than not, in I the entertainment bracket. One characteristic which is obviously missing is guilt. Henry Pulling may have regrets, but they aren't for his misspent youth. Quite the otherwise. Attending his mother's funeral Pulling meets his Aunt Augusta for the first time. Augusta pulls Pulling into her rather dubious life. While he does not go kicking and screaming, there is a fair amount of hemming and hawing and worry about his dahlias. Since retiring as a bank manager, he has made weekly visits to his mother, dahlias and delivery dinners from Chicken the anchors of his world. Now he is in Istanbul, with his aunt, dealing with what? Smuggling? Nazi war criminals, Arab traders, Colonel Hakim, the head of the police. Returning to his mundane life turns out to not be the relief he expected. No one in Travels is a certain quantity, Henry Pulling included. Morals, mores, these are uncertain too. Is the misspent youth perhaps the one that was not misspent, but one of blindly following a path of conformity? This is the main theme of the book though the value of religion, the questionable role of the US and Britain in The Near East and South America, the nature of love and family are also explored. When I first heard of Travels, that would have been in the '70s, I imagined the aunt was likely to be a harmless eccentric, rather like the aunt in Towers of Trebizond. So wrong! With her collections of Venetian glass and pot smoking West African lover she seems so at first, but no. She isn't a lovable or admirable character, but still engaging and likable. While the characterization of Augusta and Henry are strong, other characters a bit too much of \"characters.\" Also, some of the plot elements rely heavily on coincidence. This is not something that bothers me over much, though there are times that it caused me to grimace. Travels does not have the weight of Heart of the Matter, however, it is not a throw away entertainment either. Like much of Greene's books, it is ultimately, despite Augusta's corrupt optimism, vaguely sad. It's just not clear why."}, {"userName": "Roberto", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15956368-roberto", "userReview": "Lezione con la ziaA volte accade qualcosa nella nostra vita che improvvisamente la divide in \"prima\" e \"dopo\".Per il protagonista di questo romanzo, Henry, gi\u00e0 pensionato \"nella mente\", che conduce una vita monotona e in solitudine e che si occupa solo delle sue dalie in giardino, l'evento che scuote la sua esistenza \u00e8 l'incontro con la vulcanica zia Augusta, settantacinquenne.La zia \u00e8 capace di grandi passioni, a differenza di Henry. \u00c8 acuta, spiritosa, anticonformista, libertina, generosa.

Aunt Augusta, on the other hand, is a rip-snorting high liver with a criminal past and (as it turns out) future with a joie de vivre Henry can only dream of. The main comedy emerges from the straight arrow tendencies of Henry clashing with the free-for-all proclivities of his aunt. We spend a little more time in England on this one (as far as I know Brighton Rock is Greene\u2019s only novel set entirely on the isle), but true to the title, we do get to France, Istanbul, Argentina, and, eventually Paraguay. Why Paraguay? Beats me.
