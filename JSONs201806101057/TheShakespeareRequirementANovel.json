Fitger, pompous and irascible as ever, finds himself elected chair of the English department, and he has no idea of the chaos and aggravation that awaits him.As if having to work on substandard equipment and in squalid conditions isn't bad enough, the Economics Department and its chair, Roland Gladwell, who convinced the university and corporate sponsors that his department needed state-of-the-art classrooms and technology, now has his eye on the English Department's remaining space. Fitger has to guard himself against angry wasps, faulty air conditioning, and a computer that might work\u2014if he could ever get the University's IT department to schedule an appointment. (And don't try to set up a meeting with him on P-Cal, the university-wide calendar system, as he refuses to use it.)But these problems are just the tip of the iceberg. He has to deal with a department in shambles, get his colleagues to adopt a new-agey Statement of Vision for the department (just ridiculous), and his attempts to get a 90-year-old Shakespearean scholar to retire backfire when the man convinces the press that Shakespeare isn't important to the English Department any longer. Plus, any requests he has have to be approved by the dean, who happens to be his ex-wife's lover. It's enough to make any man crumble.\nThe Shakespeare Requirement\n follows Fitger as he navigates university and department politics, tries to figure out exactly what his relationship is with his ex-wife, and wonders what secrets his assistant, Fran, is hiding. The book shifts narration among a number of characters\u2014Fitger, his ex-wife Janet; Philip, Fitger's boss and Janet's lover; Fran; Roland Gladwell; Professor Cassovan, the Shakespeare expert; and Angela, a sheltered student away from home for the first time.What I enjoyed so much about \nDear Committee Members\n (see my review) is that it was an epistolary novel\u2014the whole story was told through letters Fitger wrote to various people within and outside the university. His voice was tremendously memorable and at times hysterically funny, plus it reminded me of a committee chairman I was working with at the time.However, this book is told in the traditional narrative style, which didn't quite work for me. While most of the characters used the same pompous, high-brow language that Fitger did in the earlier book, the story didn't flow as well in this manner. I thought there were too many characters to follow, and after a while there were so many machinations to keep straight, so much politics to navigate, I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped.Stories of systemic dysfunction and office politics are often humorous, and some may find this funnier than I did. There's no doubt that Schumacher is a talented storyteller, and these characters are fascinating. I'd love her to write another epistolary novel someday\u2014it's a terrific change of pace!NetGalley and Doubleday Books provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

I think the most obvious is the format: this is not an epistolary novel like its predecessor, Dear Committee Members. I think that makes it less unique, and perhaps less memorable, because of the shift in subtext and character perspective. It does, however, I think, make this novel on the whole more humanistic (by that, I mean more reflective of real human people). I like it more than not, and would recommend it to readers who like Richard Russo's stuff (not just because of the easy academia comparison to Straight Man, but because of style)."}, {"userName": "Lorri Steinbacher", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1799746-lorri-steinbacher", "userReview": "The Shakespeare Requirement does what a comic novel should do. It skewers its subject-- academia--in all the right places. The atmosphere and personalities are exaggerated, but only enough to bring the ridiculous into relief. It's over the top, but just, and you relate. Fitger is an impossible character to like and yet through your exasperation with literally everything he does or tries to do you find yourself rooting for him. Fun. Made me remember how much I liked Dear Committee Members."}, {"userName": "Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11177654-jeanne", "userReview": "Although this moves very slowly the characters entrenched in how they see importance of what is pase in education rings true\u2014as does the politics. Just yesterday I read a university wants to do away with the English major. At a time a generation isn\u2019t being taught penmanship, spelling, or extended vocabulary we may end up with a society who uses emojis to communicate ideas."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1015287-molly", "userReview": "The Shakespeare Requirement is just as delightful a send-up of academic culture as Julie Schumacher's previous book, Dear Committee Members. Jason Fitger, reluctant chair of the English department, finds himself faced with a dilapidated building, a new and terrible online scheduling system, and a bizarrely adversarial Economics department that is working to push the English department off-campus altogether. The plot is a bit thin, but the characters are so endearing (apart from the Economics chair, Roland Gladwell, who is perhaps the academic equivalent of Steve Mnuchin) that it was pretty easy to overlook. Being an occasional English instructor and a librarian at a community college, I might be more the target audience for this book than other folks. Part of the plot's resolution hinges on some wordplay that should be obvious, but manages to remain cleverly disguised right up to the book's end. Very impressive.

Once more into the breach...Now is the fall of his discontent, as Jason Fitger, newly appointed chair of the English Department of Payne University, takes aim against a sea of troubles, personal and institutional. His ex-wife is sleeping with the dean who must approve whatever modest initiatives he undertakes. The fearsome department secretary Fran clearly runs the show (when not taking in rescue parrots and dogs) and holds plenty of secrets she's not sharing. The lavishly funded Econ Department keeps siphoning off English's meager resources and has taken aim at its remaining office space. And Fitger's attempt to get a mossbacked and antediluvian Shakespeare scholar to retire backfires spectacularly when the press concludes that the Bard is being kicked to the curricular curb. Lord, what fools these mortals be! Julie Schumacher proves the point and makes the most of it in this delicious romp ofsatire.", "title": "The Shakespeare Requirement: A Novel", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38885815-the-shakespeare-requirement", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1519858266l/38885815.jpg", "reviews": 7, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/92570.Julie_Schumacher", "name": "Julie Schumacher"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Humor", "Academic"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38885815-the-shakespeare-requirement", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36978055-the-shakespeare-requirement", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19288259-dear-committee-members", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3097734-black-box", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12858678-the-unbearable-book-club-for-unsinkable-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/790268.The_Book_of_One_Hundred_Truths", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/159651.The_Chain_Letter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
