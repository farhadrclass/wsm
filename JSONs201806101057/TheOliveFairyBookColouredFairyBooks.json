The sun may shine purple and zebras may be blue and green polka dots but however fantastical the imagined world may be the stories retain a faithfulness to the moral order of the actual universe. The characters in the metaphors are not just random figments of a fancy imagination but rather reflections of our own invisible world, the supernatural. The audio book version of \"The Olive Fairy Book\" is now complete and has been cataloged here: http://librivox.org/the-olive-fairy-b... Each short story is read by a different reader. I started this book as a project on LibriVox a few months ago. I was the Book Coordinator as well as the Dedicated Proof Listener. Many different LibriVox readers signed up to read one or more of the 29 fairy tales told in this book."}, {"userName": "Erin \u2615 *Proud Book Hoarder*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3048260-erin-proud-book-hoarder", "userReview": "As before with the Blue Book, many of these were long in length. I didn't recognize most of these, but my favorite new one is probably The Billy Goat and the King just because the characters amused me - the king with his giggles and the wife with her suspicious glares. Want a perfect life and happiness? Apparently that's achievable only by falling in love with a beautiful prince or princess - the moral of most of these stories.I may enjoy some of these more in print format since I listed to audio, and let's admit that audio and I are a bit out of sync."}, {"userName": "Shauna", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6394569-shauna", "userReview": "Sadly, this collection ran more in the way of The Billy Goat And The King, in which the happy ending comes in the form of a wise old goat teaching the King to better control his wife by threatening to beat the poor woman. I'm afraid neither women or men come out of the grand majority of these stories at all well.There are a scant few tales in The Olive Fairy Book that I truly enjoyed, but they earn those three stars."}, {"userName": "Lila", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4656570-lila", "userReview": "Andrew Lang's Colored Fairy Books are classics that I somehow missed as a child.

It's definitely my favorite of Andrew Lang's Fairy Books. I was lucky enough to get an illustrated version. The pictures are beautiful and the stories are entertaining.My favorite stories:- The Blue Parrot (my favorite one of all)- The Story of Little King Loc- Kupti and Imani- Dorani- The Story of Zoulvisia- The Snake Prince- The Boy Who Found Fear at Last- The Punishment of the Fairy Gangana- The Silent PrincessA few stories weren't to my liking (The Strange Adventures of Little Maia, Grasp All, Lose All, He Wins Who Waits) or flat-out confusing (Geirlug the King's Daughter comes to mind), but overall the stories were excellent. I like how non-European stories dominate the book - it's nice to see stories from other cultures. Definitely a recommendation for fairy tale lovers!"}, {"userName": "Mary Catelli", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21198579-mary-catelli", "userReview": "A mix of tales leaning toward India and the Middle East. \"The Green Knight\" gives us a new and different promise a dying queen should not extract from her husband. \"The Prince and Princess in the Forest\" and \"The Silent Princess\" are unusual tales.

These aren't the traditional \"disney\" fairy tales that have become so popular. Yes, many have happy endings, but these are traditional fairy tales that contain a point.

I love fairy tales.In this collection there were quite a bit that weren't familiar to me. Some of those were confusing to say the least."}, {"userName": "Kaion", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2670571-kaion", "userReview": "At this point in the series, Lang must have long run out of the more familiar stories and casted further abroad for this 11th(!) installment of the Fairy Book series. If the volume is somewhat lacking in first-rate tales as a result, it largely makes up for this in freshness. There's also a general cohesiveness to the collection that at times lacking in the Red Fairy Book\u2014 sure, there's the same number of literary fairy tales that have been abridged beyond intelligibility\u2014 but overall the writing has become more polished. With stories from Sudan, Armenia, Turkey and India, \nThe Olive Fairy Book\n certainly fulfills my wish for more \"cultural variety\" in the series. Anyway, to the highlights!:- Jackal or Tiger? (Indian, unattributed) is an odd little tale of marital dispute, in which the comic exaggeration of greed and selfishness juts up against the darker currents of familial breakdown and suggestions of murder and incest. This is the stuff of Greek tragedy, I'm saying, so it seems especially strange that the king gets a relatively happy ending. Water and blood seem to be the major motifs in the story \u2014 the bond of blood which he doesn't owe to his father (and half-sister) vs. the bond of water by which he is connected to the witch. So then, magic is only created through an alchemical reaction of both, a sacrifice given of both honor and blood. Who knows what this has to do with the jackal/tiger though.- Kupti and Imani (Punjabi, unattributed) is a charming take on the classic story of good sister/bad sister in which bad sister is lazy and unprincipled and good sister is hardworking and self-reliant (see \"Tam and Cam\"). Imani is altogether awesome and it's nice for once to have a romance with a long friendship/courting period. As it always is though, no one recognizes anyone else in drag. Also, you should seek medical advice from monkeys: \n\"It's a pity that we can't tell some man of a medicine so simple, and so save a good man's life. But men are so silly; they go and shut themselves up in stuffy houses in stuffy cities instead of living in nice airy trees, and so they miss knowing all the best things.\"\n- Major Campbell is credited with a number of amusing Punjabi folk stories, notably Diamond Cut Diamond, in which we learn the only way to defeat a con artist is a hire a better one. He also provides Dorani, an even more heartening variation of the \"Dancing Princesses\" story than the one I praised from The Red Fairy Book. As in that rendition, Dorani leaves the life of nightly escape of her own accord. Not because she has been bested; rather, having found her voice within the dream, she is ready to take it with her into reality.- Silence as an act of female self-determination/defiance (see The Piano, dir. Jane Campion) rears its head again in the Turkish The Silent Princess. Echoing something of 1001 Nights, the hero must spin a story every night that tempts the princess to speak, or lose his head in the failing. Notably he does so by engaging her intelligence, and even more importantly, each story ends with the exercise of female judgment. Ignac Kunos also provides The Boy Who Found Fear At Last, which true to the title, shares a similar premise to the Grimm's \"The Story of a Youth Who Went Forth To Learn What Fear Was\". Where the Grimm tale is a comically morbid affair that implies fearlessness is a kind of sociopathy, \"The Boy Who Found Fear At Last\" is even more haunting in its implication that it is our ties to society that provide the greatest (existential) horrors: \n\u2018The king! the king!\u2019 but as he listened to the cries, a vision, swifter than lightning, flashed across his brain. He saw himself seated on a throne, spending his life trying, and never succeeding, to make poor people rich; miserable people happy; bad people good; never doing anything he wished to do, not able even to marry the girl that he loved [...] a cold shiver, that he knew not the meaning of, ran through him.\u2018This is fear whom you have so long sought,\u2019 whispered a voice, which seemed to reach his ears alone. And the youth bowed his head as the vision once more flashed before his eyes, and he accepted his doom, and made ready to pass his life with fear beside him.\nAnd all that time Lang insisting the Fairy Books are for children. Ha!
