Whet my appetite it did, and it was great to learn a bit more about Joan Didion and hear some of what she has to say. But Sara Davidson, who inserted herself into the story as Joan's friend and fellow writer, came across as rather callow. What's more, writing about Joan Didion sets her up to have her writing compared to Didion's, and that's a face-off Sara Davidson could never hope to win, and doesn't--not by a long shot."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/251567-karen", "userReview": "There were only a handful (or even less) books that influenced me deeply after reading; The Year of Magical Thinking by Didion was one of them. This particular book she wrote right after her husband's death from heart attack. The grief and pain in the book were so raw and deep that I could feel my own heart being torn into pieces. I purchased her newest book, Blue Nights, on publication date, but decided to put it aside until I'm actually emotionally stable enough to devour another sad book from her. Most of the times, I feel too vulnerable to let her strong words play with my feelings.I read this book to prepare for my reading of Blue Nights. It's wonderfully written. The author knows Didion quite intimately, and has been friends with her for over 40 years. The Joan Didion one perceived from this book is as real as one could get. The author captured her physical, emotional, and spiritual changes through out the years in a wonderful way."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "Although this is a short read, it is extremely moving. Literary journalist Sara Davidson discusses her long friendship with author Joan Didion. She first met Didion in 1971, as a young reporter full of admiration, and found herself welcomed into the author\u2019s life and family. There are tales of dinner parties in LA and a disconcerting story about Davidson\u2019s problems with a young nanny, whom she had employed to look after her son. However, this is not really about Hollywood actors or the film industry, or even their writing. Really, this is a story of friendship and life \u2013 of love and grief. For Joan Didion suffered the loss of both her husband and her only child within a short period and the tragedy is something that she has explored in her writing, but, more than that, had to cope with. It has made me want to re-read the work of Joan Didion - both her novels and essays - if you are interested in this talented author, this is a good introduction to her life by someone who both admires her writing and her courage as a woman."}, {"userName": "Jan C", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1855321-jan-c", "userReview": "Interesting story of two friends. I thought it interesting that they had some of the same teachers at Berkley, but at different times.Joan is a very private woman so it took a friend to crack the center. Years ago, I read several of her books and then, of course, The Year of Magical Thinking. She has been criticized for working her way through things, like her husband's death, in a book which made it kind of public. She responds by saying that is how she works through everything, by writing about it."}, {"userName": "Joan Winnek", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2605869-joan-winnek", "userReview": "After I read the last two books by Joan Didion, this short work gave further insight into Joan Didion as a person and how she confronts loss and aging."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7933062-bill", "userReview": "Brief but informativeWorth the price for the story of Warren Beatty's failed pass at Joan. \"This would not be... feasible,\" she said.

I was just a bit too young to say I was a woman of the 60s, and when I read the preview of this book, I wanted to read it right away. Inspiring. Joan Didion lived a life on the lovely Paciific Coast, and though she was awarded handsomely with the friendships of Celebrities and Writers and other creative people, she had much sadness. She survived, and reading her story meant a lot to me, \"the belief that she would get through what she had to get through.\" (The same words used by my Mom, when my Dad passed away.)Joan wrote an essay, \"Self Respect.\" I did not read it, but I'll keep a copy ready for my Granddaughter, because the young girls today need all the guidance they can get. BTW, this book is published as an eBook, from the Byliners Series.

If you haven't read anything by Joan Didion, you probably wouldn't be interested. I've read two things by her, so it was intriguing. She has some great insights on writing (obviously, since she is an award-winning writer!). I actually thought about reading some of it to my freshmen. I don't think that Joan and I would ever be friends. Although I don't think she really is, she comes off as cold and self-interested--even before experiencing such tragedy. Davidson's writing is ok, yet at times it seemed to be a lot of: I asked her this and she said this... I am envious of the Dunne's home in Trancas!"}, {"userName": "Mary Sawyer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23361747-mary-sawyer", "userReview": "This was the first \"book\" I read on my new \"Paperwhite Kindle.\" It is a \"Kindle Short\" that was perfect in-bed reading for those 2-4 AM wakeups. I appreciated Davisdon's spare style and learning more about Joan Didion--a writer, woman, wife, and mother. This combination--writer, woman, wife, mother--hit the jackpot in terms of my reading passions.
