That said, this was quite possibly my favorite installment of Peter Grant's story yet. The characterization is interesting, there are developments in Peter's personal life, and the overall arc of the series takes a satisfying and solid step forward.I love the variety of characters and backgrounds, although this particular edition spends more time with the upper crust. Particularly for a mystery, one needs a wide enough cast for there to avoid obvious red herrings or red shirts. The broad number is appropriate for Peter balancing between his more magical life in the Folly, his personal life and his investigations. For the most part, I usually get the feeling that the diversity of characters is merely a representation of the city and not a checkbox; it is a part of who they are, but not the only important trait. DC Guleed, a female who wears a hijab, was introduced as a minor character in Whispers Under Ground, but is starting to play a significant role. Most of this seemed to be developed in the graphic novel Rivers of London: Body Work, #1, but for the most part one needn't have read it as she starts to come into her own as the logical and level counterpoint to Peter's leaps of logic and daredevil spirit. I particularly love her diplomatic skill on the phone:\"I heard Guleed pass this on and some grumbled swearing from Seawoll. 'Tell him to get his arse down here pronto,' he said. 'He wants you to come in,' said Guleed and gave me the address.\"Plotting remains pleasantly unpredictable for me. While the stories ostensibly have a main investigation, Peter leads a busy life. There are opportunities to learn more about magic and its practitioners, Peter's family, the ongoing investigation into Leslie, side investigations such as hunting down the Little Crocodiles, learning about the history of the Folly and so forth. Because of it, both the plots and the pacing often surprise me. I also enjoy that it is very much a 'police procedural.' Peter occasionally goes to a desk, he works a computer, he explains to the reader the structure of a murder investigation within the London police. He frequently has asides to explain the approach and legality of police actions: \"Guleed circled around the names and the timeline for twenty minutes, twenty minutes being about the amount of time it takes your average suspect--sorry, I mean witness--to forget the details of the lies they've just told you, before asking about the drugs.\"But at the end of the day, it's always the writing that hooks me. Aaronovitch does a lovely job of giving us a scene, or Peter's thoughts about how he is approaching something, but he rarely tells us how we are supposed to feel about it. That ability to show without telling seems particularly rare in UF. The suspect's eyes may \"glance at\" something, but they usually don't \"furtive\" anything. I don't precisely know how Peter feels about Inspector Seawoll, for instance, although my best guess is that it is a complex combination of respect, fear, and a tiny bit of appreciation. It's a technique I first recognized in Agatha Christie, where people are presented, implications perhaps drawn, but it's left to the reader to draw the conclusions, and they may be different. For instance: \"Lady Ty... asked the question again in a tone I recognized from my own mum. The one that says: Yes there's going to be trouble, but that is as nothing to the trouble you are going to be in if you continue to cross me.\"  I had a crystal clear visual/audio on that one, but mine is likely going to be different from yours. There's no \"icily,\" \"stonily\" or \"scathingly\" or any other of the hundred routine descriptives I feel pepper the average UF.Ben Aaronvitch's Peter Grant series has become one of the most satisfying urban fantasy detective novels in the field. Read it, and then listen to Kobna Holdbrook-Smith's audio version. You can thank me later.Speaking of thanks, I owe some to Orient, Caro, Milda and Mimi for allowing me to crash their buddy read. It extra fun to read with other people as enthusiastic as they are for Grant."}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "I did not realise when I chose this bewitching and beguiling book to read that it was the 6th in a established series. A lot of world building has been done by this stage. As a result, there was a lot I had to catch up on and make sense of, but I didn't care, I was just loving what I was reading. I slowly began to understand more and more. There is a great sense of location in its setting of London. Peter Grant, is a black police detective attached to the Folly, a unit set aside to look at crime in the magical underworld with his extraordinary boss, Nightingale. It all begins with Lady Ty, a major river god of the Thames, demanding that Peter keep her daughter, Olivia, out of an investigation where Christina Chorley appears to have died of a drug overdose in a exclusive flat in Mayfair. A request that Peter is not able to comply with.Peter is smart, in a relationship with Beverly Brook, who is a river god, is constantly developing experimental magical gadgets and weapons to aid crime fighting, which given the prowess of his magical opponents, come in useful. He is constantly working to improve and add to his spellmaking. He is partnered with DC Sahra Guleed, a force to be reckoned with herself. The case turns out to be significantly more complex and bigger than expected. There is the return of their foes, the Faceless Man and Lesley, the ex-cop who turned to the dark side. A number of parties want to get their hands on Jonathan Wild's Ledger, including a shady bunch of American operatives which Special Agent Kim Reynolds of the FBI warns Peter about. The Hanging Tree is the Tyburn gallows located where the Marble Arch is now. There are phenomenal magical battles, violence, a trail of destruction and demolition with Peter and DC Guleed fighting for their lives.This is a story with plenty of comic touches and humour. The world building is just fabulous, spellbinding and the writing is impressive. The characters are complex, diverse and superb and include spirits and ghosts. I became particularly fond of Sahra Guleed when she administered a well executed Glasgow kiss. I really did not want the book to end. It is a series that gets the reader hooked almost immediately. Loved it, and needless to say, will be reading others in the series. Brilliant novel that I cannot recommend highly enough. Thanks to Orion for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Carol.

Kobna's work on the London stage since 2003 would seem to be ideal preparation for the range of accents, voices and emotions used in the Peter Grant series. One official site lists a dizzying array of accent skills, along with fluency in English, Fanti and Ghanaian, (site: https://www.spotlight.com/interactive...) put to good use on the occasions Peter's mum makes an appearance.In this particular book, much of it takes place in the world of the 'posh' elite, giving us a chance to appreciate a range of upper-class/highly educated accents. Somehow, Kobna is able to give us the sassy tones of Bev, the clipped tone of Lady Ty controlling her temper, Nightingales' measured and articulate speech along with the working-class, foul-mouthed drawl of Inspector Seawoll and the swarmy, entendre-laden tones of Reynard the Fox and make me believe each character. That, to me, is flipping ah-maz-ing. For comparison, one of the first audiobooks I listened to was a female reader for Stephanie Plum book, and her voicing of the males in the books felt so false, so awkward, that I was thrown out of the story every time they spoke. Not so here. The only misstep to me is the brief appearance of American Kim Reynolds. Other Americans fair better. I'd also like to remember that one dangerous moment for Peter (oh, shush; there's many in every book) where Kobna drops his voice nearly to a whisper to read, sending chills up my spine. Just perfect.To my delight, there's an interview at the end between Aaronovitch, Holdbrook-Smith and one of the marketers from Gollancz that answers many wonderings. For instance, it seems Ben can't avoid Kobna's voice either, and sometimes when he writes he thinks of how the words will sound when read, particularly because Peter is prone to long chunks of distracted thought 'missing a full stop.' And, somewhat reassuringly, other listeners would agree with me that the only voice not done wonderfully is the American. Kobna's mock-outrage at the charge is endearing. In the interview, Ben mentions that he doesn't have a 'meta' plot all worked out for the series, that his philosophy is 'take care of the story and the meta will work itself out.' I think that explains a great deal about the immediate and meta plotting of the books, which might prove unsatisfying for those who look for an explicitly \"progressing\" arc rather than episodes in the adventures of life (Note: I too wish my own meta-life would make more progress, but my approach to my own life must be something like Ben's writing). At any rate, my take-away is that Kobna and the series are reassuringly linked. Thank the urban-fantasy audio gods. Or the river ones."}, {"userName": "Orient", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43587353-orient", "userReview": "My playdate with Peter Grant is over and I already miss our great time together <3 He\u2019s always a charmer in his way of dealing with difficulties :)Well, we all have our ways of dealing with difficulties \u2013 mine is to ask stupid questions.Mr. Aaronovitch once again charmed me with his fab skill combining detective genre, police work, mythology and wit with UF. The book is well paced as well as entertaining to read. Mr Aaronovichs combined humor with serious content in an endearing and gripping way that made me giggle almost all the time. There is easy-flowing and sometimes dark wit in the writing which suited me well as it\u2019s not my first date with Peter Grant and the ongoing tone of the series has the sharp hook and characters I root for. \"The Hanging Tree\" answered some questions that kept bugging me about Peter Grant\u2019s world (who's the big bad villain, what's his intentions, what happened to some of the characters from earlier book and ect.) and (to my joy) added some new questions and made me hungry to know more about the Rivers of London and the magical world around them. That means that Peter Grant is not going to stop charming me and won\u2019t end his adventure quickly <3 (Please Mr. Aaronovitch, make it 10 books at least!!! ;))Like elite brandy, the story together with the amazing writing skill of the writer, bloomed with good quality and it's definitely improving as the series continue. Magical London with enchanting Goddesses and charming mixed race characters is what I need to be totally sucked in :)I was so happy to have more of Guleed, the shiny new Peter\u2019s partner in dealing with magical crimes. She\u2019s definitely worth to be my favorite kickass heroine as nobody sneaks up on the Muslim ninja. I even find her more likable than Lesley. Maybe Guleed will have he permanent role in Peter Grant series <3 ...the first draft of Procedures Relating to Serious Falcon Incidents a.k.a. How to Deal with Weird Bollocks was currently sitting as a half-finished Word document on my hard drive back at the Folly.I called Nightingale, who said he was fifteen minutes away and asked him to authorise a little look.\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said immediately. \u2018But carefully, Peter.\u2019I told Guleed that it was standard procedure for a second officer to stay outside the immediate Zone of Potential Magical Effect (ZPME) in order to facilitate communications should my Airwave and personal phones be compromised. Guleed was rightly suspicious.\u2018Is that true?\u2019 she asked.Just as soon as I get back to the Folly and add it to the Word document, I thought.\u2018Just make sure nobody rushes in,\u2019 I said. \u2018Especially youI felt at home in the Folly once more. Also I got more of Mr. Witcher and it was great to watch him doing his magic in the battle field. Thought, I think, Molly still has to wait for her star-hour. I would eagerly wait for that! :)It was great to see the mouthy duo of Seawoll and Stephanopoulos having fun in more episodes :D\u2018No offence, Peter,\u2019 she said. \u2018But we were kind of relying on you to provide that information. Us just being normal run of the mill coppers none of who are versed in the mystic arts or currently shagging a supernatural creature.\u2019Olivia and Phoebe had been watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine on that TV when the attack started and had only avoided serious injury because they\u2019d both happened to be lying prone on the sofa.\u2018Saved by snogging,\u2019 had been Seawoll\u2019s verdict. \u2018Let that be a lesson to you.\u2019I like when the bad villain is not easily defeated and the one in this book (and the series too) is a long-term one. He has a great acolyte to help in making an even bigger mess. Their team is cruel, shrewd and witty \u2013 a dangerous and charming combination to make them a perfect rival for Peter and his friends :) There\u2019s a hint that one more terrible evil force from the earlier books is going to make a grand show in the future books! Can\u2019t wait to dive into another adventure with Peter Grant!This book was a really alluring and entertaining ride with my beloved characters from the earlier books and the new likable ones :)"}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "These books have steadily been getting better and better and better, or perhaps it's just me getting so far invested in the stories that I can't even tell the difference anymore.Either way, this says very great things about the books. :)I am invested as hell.Aaronovitch's UF writing is rather unique in that his mystery writing is unparalleled, the magic system is firmly grounded, explored, and interesting, and the MC in Peter is just a lovable nerd. Never mind that he's an apprentice wizard working for the London police force or a small subsidiary called the Folley, this is really just a fantastic police procedural full of unpredictable mysteries and grabbing reveals.This book, however, takes everything that has been building up in the previous five books and focuses yet again on the Faceless Man and poor Leslie. In my opinion, this was a squee-worthy move on the author's part. At least, I was practically slathering with all the great reveals and directions it took.Dealing with the rich and the issue of the other mystery was well enough and a nice departure, to be sure, but getting back into the grand arc story was simply delicious.And now I'm stuck in the unenviable position of pining away for book seven. Who knows how long it will take? Alas!Do I recommend this UF? HELL YES. It's one of the very best. :)"}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Now we are in the springtime of our discontent, when I must wait until JUNE!! for the next installment in this freakin\u2019 great series!Ben Aaronovitch has created one of the best urban / contemporary fantasy series of recent date, or HELL for that matter EVER, with his Peter Grant series. Grant is the protagonist, a police constable in the Metropolitan police force of London who, a few books back, saw a ghost and then was approached by a dapper Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Nightingale who introduced him to a very small section of the Met whose job it was to investigate and sort out crimes of the ... eh, um \u2026 magical sort.Grant soon learned that using the \u201cM\u201d word was generally frowned upon, that the existence of this branch of the service was known to the higher ups, mostly accepted, though grudgingly and with not a small tough of standoffishness and HEY PRESTO! Nightingale settled Peter in as his next apprentice \u2013 wizard.Or practitioner as they say in the Folly, the name of the HQ of this mysterious department.And so we come to Aaronovitch\u2019s brilliant sixth book in the series (though there are a few short stories and some graphic novels \u2013 of which I am ravenously reading). Published in 2016 we are now in the desperate wait for the next in the series, 2018\u2019s(!) Lies Sleeping.Up to now we\u2019ve seen plenty of the \u201cM\u201d word as Peter learns to make spells and to get better at his new craft. All the while he is also maintaining and getting better at being a proper copper in the old London sense. We\u2019ve learned of magical creatures, Fae, underworld characters of vague origin and, of course, the Rivers.Unlike some other urban fantasies with your garden variety vampires and werewolves, Aaronovitch has only given us hints of such folks, or when he does it\u2019s in a new style, with new rules, and only subtly hinted at. And unlike resurrecting the old Celtic and Norse (and Greek, Egyptian, Slavic, etc. etc.) pantheons, our writer describes Genius loci \u2013 or gods of the rivers. These are incarnations of the rivers themselves with godlike powers. We meet Father Thames, up near the source, and Mother Thames in the city and then all the tributaries as lesser gods and goddesses.And there is a recurring mysterious villain called the Faceless Man, whose nefarious machinations keep creeping up to endanger Peter and lure Nightingale into a magical duel.And it\u2019s FUN, FUN, FUN!The Hanging Tree finds Peter and the Met allies of the Folly investigating a possible overdose that involved one of the daughters of Tyburn, the most powerful of Mother Thames children. This search leads to more clues about the Faceless Man and more magic tomfooleries than you can shake a whomping willow at."}, {"userName": "Caro M.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7951847-caro-m", "userReview": "You guys are so awesome - you gave me more than 30 likes before I've even started reading the book!!! <3 :D"}, {"userName": "Caro M.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7951847-caro-m", "userReview": "So you've already heard that prince Harry is dating some black girl, huh?

I like how Aaronovitch is adding new characters into every next book and how they're always so well done and well described. Also, he never forgets about the old ones. There's one comeback that you might be surprised with... Not spoiling! I only wish there was more Molly in this story. Our Molly from the Folly definitely deserves more action than a mere baking session. Although I enjoy the idea that she's on Twitter. Who knows, maybe we can befriend her on facebook too? And our good old Nightingale - he's also got some new... friends. I only wish he was up for no good more often!!As always we get a lot of information on London and it's architecture and a little glimpse into the history of the city, which is just great.

The extremely cool aspect of this is that Peter Grant (the constable apprentice) is a policeman first and a wizard second, and modern day policing is at least as strange as any wizardry.This installment substantially moves the ongoing plot forward along with the groundwork being laid for an extension of the Folly's base and formalizing even more of their processes. The Faceless Man makes an appearance and we also get to see other magical traditions in this world play out. The Folly is working ever closer with traditional policing, and Peter continues to be a wonderful conduit in both directions.For long running urban fantasy series there's few things better than being able to say \"moves the plot forward\". There's a tendency to tread water while exploring niche interesting details of the overall world, cynically speaking to drag things out and sell more books. There's an element of both here. While the plot moves forward, the Faceless Man situation is not resolved here."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "[catch the Faceless Man or Lesley  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788446-hannah", "userReview": "I have a problem with urban fantasy; which is weird because I love fantasy. But the Dresden files got on my nerves real quick, I disliked the two Sandman Slim books I read and pretty much every other series I started, but I do love the Peter Grant books. I find them to be not only clever and well-plotted but also often hilarious. Peter is one of the best protagonists I have ever encountered and his voice is just perfectly suited for the stories told. He is capable without being over-powered, he is optimistic without being unrealistic, and most importantly he seems like a genuinely nice guy. But he isn't the only great character in the books; especially Guleed holds a special place in my heart and their interaction is just lovely. The Rivers are brilliant and all fully-fleshed out (and their family-dynamic is so realistic!). They are again at the centre of the mystery, as Lady Ty's daughter has been arrested for some drug related offense - and as Peter still ows Tyburn a favour, he needs to get involved. As usual this is only one of several storylines; as the Faceless Man is still unfound.I cannot believe the next book does not even have a release date yet. I was so happy when this book finally arrived (its release-date having been changed a few times) that I didn't even think about not reading it immediately. But now the wait begins anew.

That was also when I realized I was irrevocably addicted to Peter Grant.The Hanging Tree is book six of the series which returns to London and places the main story arc back on track, following the short respite we took to the countryside with our protagonist in Foxglove Summer. The story begins with a drug-related death at a house party in one of the most exclusive residential areas in the city. Normally, the case wouldn\u2019t have been within the purview of the Folly, which the Met\u2019s investigative unit for all things magical and paranormal, except for the fact that one of the party goers turned out to be the daughter of Lady Ty, goddess of the river Tyburn. Suddenly, Peter is in a bind since he owes Lady Ty a favor, and as such he has reluctantly agreed to do all he can to keep her teenage daughter Olivia out of investigation. But as it turns out, his promise might be a moot point. After all, what do you do when the young lady in question is actually brazenly admitting to be the one who gave the victim the drugs which might have led to the fatal overdose?Meanwhile, Peter and his boss Nightingale are also back on the trail of the Faceless Man, the main baddie of the series. Word on the street is that a rare book on magical properties has gotten everyone in the practitioner community in a tizzy trying to get their hands on it, including covert groups from abroad. Peter has reason to suspect that the Faceless Man has his fingers all over this one, but then there\u2019s a lot going on here, including the fatal house party, Lady Tyburn\u2019s daughter and the person she\u2019s protecting, the mysterious book, a foxy thief, and the American agents who have suddenly shown up in town. Now Peter\u2019s job is to find out how all of this is connected.The Hanging Tree might not be my favorite in the series, but it was still very much worth the wait. For one thing, we come closer than ever before to finding out all the answers and discovering the whole truth behind the Folly\u2019s greatest nemesis. In addition, a complicated figure from Peter\u2019s past also makes a return bearing surprises for our protagonist. If you\u2019ve been following along all this time, then this book is definitely not to be missed, especially in light of the significant revelations dropped on us in the latter half of the story.That said, I also thought it fell short of being one of the best Peter Grant books because it had a lot less of the dry, sardonic humor which has always been one of the key hallmarks of this series. While still very enjoyable, this might be the first one that didn\u2019t make me literally laugh out loud. There also wasn\u2019t enough of Nightingale. What I wouldn\u2019t give to see him kick some ass again in another epic wizarding duel, instead of just hearing everyone around him talk about it. He is like the Met\u2019s secret weapon that gets waved in front of our faces a lot, but we hardly ever get to see him in action.In terms of criticisms though, that was probably the extent of it, which made me very happy since I had such high expectations for this book. It wasn\u2019t always fast-paced, but as far as police procedurals go, it had just the right amount of mystery, suspense, and action. The story had so many moving parts that Aaronovitch was constantly juggling and keeping aloft, I can\u2019t say there was really much time for anything else. Still, we got to see a little more of Peter\u2019s relationship with Beverly, and I\u2019m also enjoying the larger role of Sahra Guleed, another police officer who is shaping up to be the perfect partner for Peter while the two of them are on the beat. They have a great working dynamic, almost like they are of one mind when they tackle everything from suspect interviews to Falcon raids, and I\u2019m really hoping this is the first step to Guleed becoming a series regular.The more urban fantasy I read, the easier it gets to spot if a sequel is \u201cfiller\u201d or an actual book where \u201cvery important things\u201d happen. The Hanging Tree, I\u2019m happy to report, definitely belongs in the latter category. Don\u2019t get me wrong because I loved the previous book which was a nice break from the hunt for the Faceless Man, but I\u2019m also pleased that this one brings us right back into thick of things and resolves some of the questions left by the shocking events at the end of Broken Homes. This book is what I would call a real game-changer. While it did end rather abruptly, it\u2019s clear that Peter and the gang will have to tread even more carefully going forward, and the next book should be very interesting indeed.

It's been years since I read a print book and I must admit I prefer the kindle. The anticipation and continued delay in publishing The Hanging Tree, book 6 in the Peter Grant series, was intense and has probably made me super sensitive and critical of some aspects of the story. My overall feeling while I was reading was, \"THIS is what I was waiting 2 years for???\".The series is known for its contemporary tone and geeky pop culture references. But I found them too repetitive and heavy-handed in the beginning. And there were some monologues from the hero PC Peter Grant that sounded nothing at all like his character and much more the author talking directly to the reader. I didn't find the mystery so engaging this time although I do love the police procedural stuff. It is very true to life and Peter is always sure to use correct policing techniques as well as magic. The story felt like one of those 'filler' type volumes that you often find as a series progresses. Not a lot happened but a few key pieces were moved around to set up stuff in the future.Ah Peter! You are such a black and white/Good vs Evil guy. This makes Lesley's defection so deliciously subversive and such a huge moral issue for you. It's fascinating watching you deal with this. Apart from that I really enjoyed it.

It feels like Aaronvitch is back on form (I didn't enjoy Foxglove Summer this much) and we're back to our familiar London setting. The story gets started quickly and doesn't let up at all- action all the way. Peter is such a down to earth protagonist and Guleed makes a fantastic sidekick. We see more of Leslie and the Faceless man. A truly modern magical romp through London.

We're back in London, and Peter Grant and friends are back in trouble. And it's the same kind of trouble that's been plaguing them since \nMoon Over Soho\n. But finally, we stop chasing after ghosts and faceless mysteries and come face to face with the man behind the mask. And there really is a face behind that mask. This reveal was indeed a surprise, but whether or not it does anything for the series' continuous arc will depend on how it plays out in later books.This book picks up a month or two following the events in \nFoxglove Summer\n, and the trouble all started when one of the Thames sisters called in a favor from Peter. What started out as a simple, straightforward investigation into whether a teenage girl's drug overdose was accidental or deliberate turned into a huge Falcon case, uncharacteristically complete with a huge revelation at the end. Not as big, imo, as the ending of \nBroken Homes\n, but it's relatively seismic as far as revelations go in this series.With that said, I must admit I'm mostly lukewarm toward this book in particular, and I've been mulling over it for a few months now, trying to figure out why that is. The writing isn't that different from previous books. \"So when a bunch of fucking kids waltz into the building, the DPG wants to know how. And I get woken up in the middle of the fucking night,\" said Seawoll. \"And told to find out on pain of getting a bollocking. Me?\" he said in outrage. \"Getting a bollocking? And just when I thought things couldn't descend further into the brown stuff--here you are.\"As a matter of fact, it's very much in line with previous books in terms of quality, plotting, pacing, humor, adventures and misadventures. Peter and the rest of the gang are developing and progressing at their usual pace--I very much enjoyed every scene with Seawoll and Stephanopoulos.\"So he's a French fairy tale,\" said Seawoll and turned to look, thank god, at Nightingale instead of me. \"Is he?\"\"That's a difficult question, Alexander,\" said Nightingale.\"I know it's a difficult question, Thomas,\" said Seawoll slowly. \"That's why I'm fucking asking it.\"Yes, but do you want to know the actual answer?\" said Nightingale. \"You've always proved reluctant in the past. Am I to understand that you've changed your attitude?\"\"You can fucking understand what you bloody like,\" said Seawoll. \"But in this case I do bloody want to know because I don't want to lose any more officers to things I don't fucking understand.\" He glanced at me and frowned. \"Two is too many.\"[...]Generally when you're interviewing somebody and they seem remarkably calm about one crime, it's because they're relieved you haven't found out about something else.Plus, there are plenty of humorous moments scattered throughout the book, and Peter is still his usual funny, likable self. So it's just like previous books.Bollocks, I thought, or testiculi or possibly testiculos if we were using the accusative.[...]\"What I'm saying here,\" Seawoll had said, \"is try to limit the amount of damage you do to none fucking whatsoever.\"I don't know where I got this reputation for property damage, I really don't--it's totally unfair.[...]\"I'm planning to blow up some phones for science.\"And yet...Something's missing. Something's not quite there anymore. And I don't know why.Maybe the timing wasn't quite right when I read it. Or maybe I'm just tired of chasing after faceless nemeses--both of 'em.I'm all for more Peter and more (mis)adventures in London. But more faceless mysteries and/or conspiracies? Nah, that's okay. I could read back to back stories of Peter running around London solving all sorts of mysterious happenings, and they may even be unrelated to each other and the series' arc, and that would be fine. Actually, I would love that. But more mysterious faceless happenings? Thanks, but no thanks.However, I am looking forward to the next installment and being back in London and back in trouble because, honestly despite the gripe, this series is still one of best urban fantasies out there, and every single book is a blast.Cross-posted at https://covers2covers.wordpress.com/2..."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14395716-mark", "userReview": "Really enjoyed reading this book.

The plot never seemed to quite come together, with a large cast of NPCs appearing and disappearing. To add to this a number of NPCs from previous books or short stories appeared without much or any reminder of their past appearances, which stopped me in my tracks repeatedly while I tried to remember details from years ago.Some of the side characters are starting to come a little more into the spotlight, which is pleasant. However I found the portrayal of Nightingale in this book slightly jarring; at some point he seems to have started to become rather more au fait with the modern world, which is realistic but also loses some elements of his charm and individuality.All in all this is a solid book that advances the metaplot, but I was expecting more."}, {"userName": "Denis Pedersen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685408-denis-pedersen", "userReview": "[ telling us the name of the Faceless Man, and what can we really do with that information?

It\u2019s bloody legacy has returned with a vengeance with the death of a girl at an exclusive party of one of the Mayfair mansions that are normally empty. The residents of the Folly don\u2019t normally bother with routine inquires about suspicious deaths, but it turns out that Lady Ty\u2019s daughter was at the party, and as Peter Grant owes her a favour he is called in to assist. Plunging straight into the world of the super-rich, with their enormous homes expensive cars, Grant is about to discover that at the point where privilege, blood and magic mix, he has a first class opportunity to make new enemies and it might have a serious impact on his life span.Aaronovitch is back with the next instalment in the highly entertaining and slick urban fantasy series, and very good it is too. He has upped the tension in this one too, and it is very fast paced, with twists and turns as you\u2019d expect. Characters from the earlier books are back as well, adding to the intrigue. I\u2019m glad they are back in London, as that is as much a part of the books as Grant, Nightingale and Molly. I almost gave five stars, as I though that this has been the best of the bunch so far; the characters are developing very well and the banter between Nightingale and Grant and the other officers is hilarious. Even though this had a really good plot, it felt like there was something being held back, that storylines were being drawn to set things up for the next in the series (please tell me that there are going to be more).

This is the 6th book in the \"Rivers of London\" series and I'd not read anything by this author before. The idea of combining a police story with some fantasy set in London appealed to me and I was intrigued as I started reading this book. I did find it took me a little while to get into the characters and the magical jargon to start with. The story as a whole revolves around Peter Grant, policeman and (magic) practitioner, and crime. Assorted river gods put in appearances as to some \"baddies\" who have featured in previous stories.I did find that it was not easy to get to grips with the magical aspects of the storyline, either relating to the actual magic or the practitioners. However coming into a series part way through that is not really surprising. Once I had got into it I found it very entertaining. The book is well paced for me. There is a very dry, flippant and frequently dark humour in the writing which suited me well. I'd be happy to recommend this series to anyone who likes the idea of it. However I would suggest starting with the first book maybe. I certainly aim to get and read the first one when I get the chance.
