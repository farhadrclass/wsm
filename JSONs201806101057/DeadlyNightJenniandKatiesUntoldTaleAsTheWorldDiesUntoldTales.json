The author also mentions that it is a sort of sequel to one of the stories from Untold Tales Volume 2 \"A Terrible Moment\". I re-read that tale before I read the new one. You don't need to but if you have it to hand or haven't read it before it's worth it to refresh your memory.I am so happy that this tale showed us badasses Jenny and Katie again, fighting hand in hand. It's what I always loved about them and what makes me miss them. I have re-read the series so many times which is not something I do a lot and I find something new to enjoy every time. This story encompassed everything I loved about them and their friendship and included some of my other favorite characters from the series. A fantastic and gripping novella.I realize Miss Frater has no plans for a sequel, and I am okay with that. The series ended fantastically and if I have to imagine in my own mind what became of Ashley Oaks then I'm okay with that too. But if the author finds any other untold tales rattling around in that brain of hers then I hope she one day decides to share them with us, perhaps one a year to help with the withdrawal!"}, {"userName": "Ron Turner", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1668426-ron-turner", "userReview": "Nothing fancy.

A zombie herd is on the outskirts of the town and the survivors huddle behind the cement walls encompassing their encampment in hopes the undead will pass them by. While Katie is on sentry duty, a child cries out in the night, spurring Jenni into action. Soon both women find themselves fighting against the ravenous undead in a seemingly futile attempt to save other survivors. Deadly Night is an original As The World Dies story that takes place between The First Days and Fighting to Survive.", "title": "Deadly Night: Jenni and Katie's Untold Tale\n      \n          (As The World Dies Untold Tales #4)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444726-deadly-night", "average": 4.2, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430998271l/23444726.jpg", "reviews": 16, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2310121.Rhiannon_Frater", "name": "Rhiannon Frater"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444726-deadly-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23432252-deadly-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9648068-the-first-days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6350211-fighting-to-survive", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6718719-siege", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12295280-as-the-world-dies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13581917-the-last-bastion-of-the-living"]}
