The story is set in Georgia and starts out with the murder of a respected college professor who is an expert on ancient Native American symbology. Before he dies, he sends off clues to a couple colleagues. The information is secret and accordingly the correspondence is coded so the contents is not obvious to someone other than recipient. One of the colleagues, Thomas Schultz an archeological expert, is kidnapped by the bad guys to decipher clues. The second colleague is Sean Wyatt. He works for an archeological outfit that travels around the world finding old artifacts. Sean is being interviewed by a journalist, Allyson Webster, about his adventures. She is also trying to get Sean to reveal some secrets. Allyson is not what she is presenting herself to be. Suddenly, Sean and Allyson are in a public gunfight barely escaping with their lives. The race is on in a scavenger hunt for clues by Thomas and the bad guys followed by Sean and Allyson hot on their trail. Following Sean and Allyson, is an Atlanta police detective investigating the trail dead people left in the wake of the chase.I thought the information surrounding the mystery as the most interesting part of the book. The characters I didn't think were all that interesting. I mean, they weren't badly written but on the other hand I didn't feel much of a connection either. I guess I felt a general lack of depth in the character department. Allyson's character I got the feeling the author didn't quite know what to do with her. She's there, partly, to create a romantic tension with Sean. This is so tepid it made me wonder why bother? The plot has lots of twists and turns but on the whole follows a fairly well-worn formula. There are stretches and jumps in places that had me going \"What?\" The story pace does move along at a good clip so as not to get bogged down.Overall, this is an entertaining and interesting reading endeavor. While it didn't knock my socks off, I like the idea. I'll be checking out other books by this author."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8104446-carol", "userReview": "Secret of the Stones by Ernest DempseySean Wyatt series Book #14.5 starsFrom The Book:Sean Wyatt's learns his best friend has been kidnapped while working on a secret project. Sean and his new acquaintance, Allyson Webster, embark on a mission to solve a series of ancient clues they he hopes will lead to whoever kidnapped his friend. The riddles lead them on a dangerous chase through the southeastern United States and to a four thousand year-old secret that is bigger than anything they could have ever imagined.My Thoughts:I liked this book so much more than I ever thought possible. It's filled from cover to cover with action, suspense, a murder and a history lesson....so what's not to like? Fiction and legend are mixed to develop a theory on the origins of Native Americans on the North American continent. The reader doesn't have to agree with the theory to be entertained by the content and the process that provided the theory. Betrayal sets the stage for the next book and I believe I will be on a search for it."}, {"userName": "Neeka", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6113515-neeka", "userReview": "This was an amazing read and I am glad that I found another series to follow - I took a chance and got this book for free through Kindle. If you like books that are filled with action, history, conspiracy, mystery, murder, and intrigue - I truly recommend this book. I found myself saying \"one more chapter \" and then of course not being able to put the book down. At times, when places are described it feels like I was reading a travel brochure - other than that I feel like this was an excellent book for a first time author. I will be sure to follow up on the other two books that Ernest Dempsey has written. Any fan of Clive Cussler will love this book - again a highly recommend fast-paced intriguing read filled with historical facts. Like most books in this genre - the historical facts do get to be a bit twisted to fit the story but the author does let you know at the end of the book. This book took a lot of research (or so it would seem) and I found myself rushing to google to see certain things the book mentioned. Take a chance with this book and check it out - you won't be sorry that you did."}, {"userName": "Marti", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38071785-marti", "userReview": "I very much enjoyed this book.

There's some typos periodically throughout the story, with some cheesy dialogue, and stuff that's a little confusing. Plus, the \"Four legendary Golden Chambers\" just doesn't really grab my imagination much. Still, it was a little intriguing. I hope the follow up Lost Chambers books improve upon it. Sorry, Ernest, I hate to put the critical parts first because I really like your writing. Your very sparing use of profanity (please keep it up), and your action-filled plot that is seasoned with enough historical research and imaginative twists that make this story a lot of fun to read.

Nothing relating to the author's writing style. I've just been busy, but I was enjoying the book, its premise and the characters he created. What made me put it aside and say, 'Nope, I'm done\" was simple. Part of the story includes a supposed agreement between the Mormon settlers moving west toward Utah and the Native American tribes in that area, specifically the Utes. Okay. I was fine with that premise. But at 2058, 40% of the way through the book on my Kindle, the author has Joe, a supposed expert on the history of the area, say this: \"Look at the history of all the white settlers that went west. There are literally hundreds of stories of Indian attacks on the wagon trains. Everyone knows about them. But there is not a single recorded incident of any tribe ever attacking a Mormon settler or a group of Mormons. Why do you think that is?\" Well, Joe (by way of Dempsey), I don't think that is. First of all, although there certainly were raids on the wagon trains by Native tribes, there were not that common (Perhaps the stories the author was thinking of may be the result of too much watching of western movies?) http://www.historybits.com/west-wagon...Second, there certainly were conflicts between Native American tribes and the Mormon Setters. Mr. Dempsey -- ever heard of the Black Hawk War? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liLXu... I was able to find multiple articles and videos which negate the statement Mr. Dempsey had his character make within 5 minutes by typing in an internet search. I would advise all you authors and hope-to-become authors to take note: if you are going to use history as a part of your novel, be sure you know the all the facts, from all sides of the story. So, that was it for me. Sorry, I can't recommend this book other than as a cautionary tale of how NOT to write a successful novel that relies on historical events."}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60951098-diana", "userReview": "Indiana Jones and Ben Franklin meet Jack Ryan and James Bondl\"The Secret of the Stones\" is Book 1 of Earnest Dempsey thriller trilogy \" The Lost Chambers\" . Dempsey's meticulous research and attention to details shows in this mystery concerning Early Native Americans origin the United States, the Advance culture of the Cherokee Nation and the archaeological search for a mythical lost Native treasure. Dempsey's hero Sean Wyatt, is an ex- agency agent who with his childhood friend, Thomas Shultz start the IIA , hunting for unique and very rare archaeology finds that often reshape the course of history. The Lost Chambers of gold Shultz suspects may be in Georgia is such a find. Shultz is kidnapped by villains looking for Native gold and Sean and a female journalist with a secret of her own, begin a rescue attempt. The story explores many state landmarks in Georgia and many a Native American myth is discussed along the way. As with Indiana Jones or Ben Franklin (Nicholas Cage in National Treasures) there are plenty of nail-biting encounters with bad men, while you are continuely wondering who you can trust in this adventure. Ernest Dempsey writes with the kind of talent you see in any Clive Cussler or Tom Clancy novel. He manages to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time! For any amatuer historian or would be archeologist, this book is well worth losing sleep over, as I assure you, might not put this book down until the mystery is solved. And if you are like me as soon as you finish you will be looking to start Book 2 of the trilogy! Well done ,Mr. Dempsey, well done!"}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3930591-claire", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As the first in a series, it introduces the main characters, and sets up the plotline which links them together. Sean and Tommy are old besties from way back and are quite likable and smart. They also seem to know anybody and everybody who might be able to help them out in their adventure. Besides the action, adventure and close calls, we have the setting of the lower Appalachian mountains of eastern Tennessee, Northern Georgia and far southwest Virginia. I enjoyed visualizing that wonderful area very much. The novel is full of old Cherokee tales, including a legend of a lost treasure. It also theorizes the possibility that North America really might have been settled from the Atlantic side .... mixed in with some Mormon theology. Of course much of this is conjecture and convenient plotting but it was still fun! The best part of the book for me was contained in the Cherokee Indian backstory: reading along, I suddenly discovered I was hip deep in my husband's ancestors!!! I love when a book is set in a place I have visited or lived, but this one followed right along with the family stories of the Cherokee ancestor from north Georgia. This was a really pleasant surprise, and I had great fun reading this part of the book to my husband and his siblings at a family gathering."}, {"userName": "Darsie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56373379-darsie", "userReview": "Fascinating and complex story. Part thriller and part historical and I love that so many of the cruicial elements are real.This is a fast paced story, so pay attention or you'll miss something vital! Sean is the main protagonist here and he provides most of the entertainment with his amusing remarks but Tommy's role is crucial in the developing story as it's his expertise pulling us all along in this urgent race to find an ancient secret, amid a slew of murders by his captors. But of course, there wouldn't be a story without Ulrich. An impressive bad guy; threatening, deadly, taciturn and imposing character throughout. I did wish for more background on all of the characters though. I felt like I had raced through this adventure with them but still barely knew them.Allyson was the most disappointing main character (actually all the women were clich\u00e9d and rather poorly developed). I kept expecting Allyson to play a more important part in the narrative. However, by the end of the story she had said very little, and although she had been a slight distraction to Sean in a moment or two, there really wasn't a great deal made of her appearance so she couldnt even be described as either eye candy or a \"love interest\". Honestly, I'm not sure why she was even there!Otherwise the storytelling was tight, the dialogue was good and the action was truly compelling.Four Stars"}, {"userName": "Mary Enck", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5389123-mary-enck", "userReview": "The Secret of the Stones (A Sean Wyatt Adventure Thriller) (The Lost Chambers Trilogy Book 1) (Kindle Edition)I received this novel as a gift and loved reading it. There is a lot of adventure going on here and it moves quick and in some surprising ways. I read a lot and I have noticed that the really good stories that are told, with that special something that keeps the energy going, seem to have a pacing that is difficult to put your finger on just how it is done. The Secret of The Stones is such a novel. I have not read the others in this series yet but based on the action in this one, I plan to do so.

Path strewn with corpses; riddles solved too easily by two separate teams of seekers; stray people joining the chase for no apparent reason.
