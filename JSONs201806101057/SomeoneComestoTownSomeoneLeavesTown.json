Depending on whether you throw it down in disgust or allow it to seduce you, you will love it or hate it but you cannot remain unmoved by this stunning tour de force unless you have the imagination of a pea. But then you would never have found this book.Raised in a dysfunctional family by a remote father and a mother who provides only comfort and clean clothes,reliliant A,the oldest of the brothers, is the least affected by his siblings rivalry and the most normal in appearance. A kind of reverse Moses figure, he cares for them all, even the one he kills, with their help. (This is not a spoiler, its referred to early on)When he comes down off the mountain, it is at first to assimilate with the world. An obbssesive compulsive, introverted, alienated yet well intentioned man, it's hardly a surprise that he falls in love with an angel who has not realized her potential, and gets swept up in a mad scheme to provide free internet access for all of Toronto.It's hard to write a cutting edge book because by the time the book circulates, its no longer cutting edge. Doctorow manages to pull this off.he is prescient enough and concise when he wants, otherwise he could out vsgue a politician.I enjoyed this book the most after I stopped trying so hard to figure it out and just enjoyed it. CD is fluid writer, reminiscent of Dick and Ballard with a bit of Coetze, Palaniak, and Chris Moore.Surely it will continue to perculate in me and maybe one day I will get it more thorougly.

The result felt incomplete since neither story was fully fleshed out, and they just didn't seem to go together. The WiFi plot seemed like it was just a platform for the author to get on his soapbox. A scene where the main character was lecturing about video rental stores keeping too much information on its customers was especially preachy. Rather than finding authentic ways to work his views into the narrative, the author just had his characters parrot his thoughts. It could have been charming, but just fell short as if it wasn't yet finished when it went to print."}, {"userName": "Fritz", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90165-fritz", "userReview": "This maddening book contains two major plot threads which happen to be, respectively, the least banal and most banal I have ever encountered:Least Banal: The protagonist's father was a mountain and his mother was a washing machine. He is trying to save his brothers, who may or may not have been eaten by another of his brothers, a zombie whom he himself killed years earlier. I wish stories like this were spread on every morning's breakfast toast.Most Banal: The context for the brother-hunt is the establishment of a metropolitan Wi-Fi mesh network for Toronto, which is (naturally) fraught with radio-frequency interference.All I can figure is that my perception of banality is a form of self-loathing directed against my own trade, software and systems engineering. I would absolutely wrap a mythological plotline around a recipe for chicken soup, for example, and not consider the soup recipe banal. I would totally do that. I would do that in a second.

We meet the central character, Alan, as he prepares to move into his new apartment by sanding the floors obsessively, then rocks up on his unknown neighbours' doorstep early in the morning with coffees for everyone, and insists they get out of bed to be sociable. This is the protagonist? How can we ever empathise with him?The story gets ever stranger as Alan's throwaway references to his father the mountain, his mother the washing machine and his nesting dolls of brothers prove to be literal, not symbolic. Who are these people, ancient gods of some kind? And how does Alan's dysfunctional and deeply odd family story relate to his quest to blanket an area of downtown Toronto with free wireless internet coverage? Well, it doesn't, really.The book shouldn't work, but somehow it does. My advice is to read it as a story and not try to invest it with any deep symbolic meaning. I found myself drawn to the strange and quite sad characters, and was completely absorbed during a three hour plane journey from Melbourne to Perth. It's not for everyone. There is quite a bit of graphic violence and some tub-thumping about freedom of communication. But never mind that.

I hated the first 40 or 50 pages which is something I can't just ignore. Those first pages seemed very male oriented and I felt like I couldn't relate to the story or characters at all, but once I got passed those first pages I became more engaged in the story, especially once the character of Kurt was introduced. Kurt was definitely my favorite character and he made the story actually enjoyable to me. I was okay with the other characters. They didn't really turn me away from the story but they weren't my favorite characters, though I did really like Kurt and Lyman. I found myself getting lost quite a bit in this story. there was a lot of jumping around and weird interspersed stories and I couldn't always follow where everyone was and what they were doing. It also took me a bit to get used to the name changing thing throughout this book. I think for me this was still an interesting read and I would probably pick up other books more similar to this in the future even if this particular book wasn't my favorite. I think for anyone thinking about reading this give it a try, but don't be ashamed about putting it aside or not completing the book if this style just isn't your thing, because I know for the first 40-50 pages I was seriously considering not finishing this book, which is not something I typically do."}, {"userName": "Ruby  Tombstone [With A Vengeance]", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5973086-ruby-tombstone-with-a-vengeance", "userReview": "There were some amazing beginnings in this book. Or some potentially amazing ideas. That is, they could have been amazing ideas, had Doctorow seen any of them through to completion. While that is almost the hallmark of Doctorow's novels, I found that the first three in particular were so scattered and poorly structured that the ideas themselves actually suffered. In this case there are also two main stories at play which really have very little to do with each other: the story of A and his bizarre family, and the story of an open wireless internet network. While the latter is interesting, it does nothing to advance or enhance the main story. If it were any other author, I would assume that the two were connected, and that I had somehow missed the point. In this novel you can also clearly see Doctorow experimenting with a few new literary devices from time to time, but without consistency. To add to the confusion, the protagonist is writing a story, so passages of this story also pepper the text. That said, I do love the surrealism of this book. In this sense it is completely different from any of his other novels. To give you a taste of what I'm getting at, the family of the protagonist consists of: Father (a mountain), Mother (a washing machine), Brother B---- (a fortune teller), Brother C---- (an island), Brother D---- (a corpse), Brothers E-F-G---- (a set of 3 Russian nesting dolls). All the brothers' names change throughout the story, retaining only their initial letter. So B----- is Bob, Billy, Bailey, Ben..... you get my point. I loved this part of the story. If Doctorow had concentrated on developing this, giving it structure and clear meaning, developing a consistent writing style - it could have been a GREAT novel. I think that's from whence my frustration stems - the sense of having missed out on something extraordinary.Don't get me wrong - this is a highly entertaining read. I would still recommend reading it. Just don't make it the first thing of Doctorow's you read. The most recent three novels are much better books."}, {"userName": "Guy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1085095-guy", "userReview": "Intriguing but ultimately unsuccessful mixture of magical realism and technopunk. Doctorow does not lack for creativity, but he does lack focus... and perhaps either a good editor or the willingness to listen to the one he has. There are numerous problems: the two strands of the story don't fit together well, the narrative jumps back and forth haphazardly (at times leaving the impression that whole sections have been inadvertently left out), the ending leaves too much unresolved (in sort of the opposite to deus ex machina, here the authorial decisions which would complete the story arcs are absent), the characters are insufficiently justified (and so appear at time to act almost randomly)... and so on. If, as a blurb from the Toronto Globe on the back claims, this is Doctorow's best work yet, then I wouldn't bother reading anything else he has written so far.

The story seems to just be the beginning and then comes to a climax of the side story while leaving the main completely in the dark.I enjoyed some of the characters, but found them to act at random and be dull in general. Relationships were unexplained and why two characters team up together is just impossible to work out.I also feel the book is too much of a political statement by the author. The more I read about the Wireless network the more I felt it was forced and the author was trying to write a propaganda piece rather then a good novel. As a geek I found the idea interesting but ultimately a silly waste of time, which while I understand is very much in character with the people involved, it didn't sit well with me on the whole.I would not advise people to read the book, while it has some solid ideas at it's foundation it didn't make the most of it's resources.

I tossed the novel when it began describing how our hero's brothers were birthed by his mother (around pages 35-40). It wasn't gross or anything like that.

He's also has some interesting ideas about writing. My particular favorite was the way he played with the names of his characters. That said, I did have some problems with the plot. I couldn't rap my mind around how Alan would get distracted from a family members murder, which could easily be followed by his own, by the idea of city-wide free internet. Just doesn't seem like a pressing issue. I also felt the ending was less than climatic or not fully resolved. City-wide internet included.

I've never read anying by Doctorow before, but I'd kept hearing how good he was. So when this audiobook became avaialable at my library, I snapped it up. I mean, how can you pass up a blurb about a dude who's father is a mountain, his mother is a washing machine, and three of his brothers are Russian nesting dolls...? You cannot.Well, this book has this weird duality with the two storylines that don't quite work out. I loved the parts about A's childhood and siblings, and their troubles (which is putting it mildly). But the other part about giving everyone free wireless internet was good, and almost as interesting...and yet it didn't seem to mesh well with the other part. But I liked it quirky characters and wanted to know what happened at the big ending scene, so I kept on.Then the big ending scene happened, and it just kind of.....fell apart, and went no where. Everyone walked away, it was really weird. I'm not even sure what all happened, and I will have to go back and listen to the last chapter again to make sure. What I do know is that the trip to the ending was well worth the read. Very interesting, and very different and singular from anything else I've read.If the two storylines had been better formulated and meshed together, and if the ending would have coalesced into something solid, and made one feel......this would have been a higher review. But since it didn't have those things, I'm going to have to give this novel 3.5 stars, and recommend it to people who don't mind the fizzle at the end.By the way, some Bronson Pinchot narrates this audiobook. I have no idea if it's the actor from the 80's sitcom or his weird redecorating show from a few years ago, or not, because this narrator doesn't sound like the actor at all."}, {"userName": "Patrick O'Neil", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1187959-patrick-o-neil", "userReview": "Title: Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town Author: Cory DoctrowFiction/Non-Fiction: FictionGenre: Science FictionDate Started Book: 7-15-2008Date Finished Book:7-23-2008Before Reading:What do I expect to gain from reading this?Knowledge of a new science fiction writer who is supposed to be good, entertainment.During/After Reading:Brief Overall Summary of the Book:Spoilers belowAllen's (or Al, or Albert, or any other name that starts with an \"A\") father was a mountain, and his mother was a washing machine. He has several brothers; Brian (or any \"B\" name) can tell the future, Craig (\"C\") is an island, Davey (\"D\") is a sociopath, and Edward, Franklin, George (\"E,\" \"F,\" \"G,\") are stacking dolls. He is the most \"normal\" of his family. He left at around age 19 or 20, to start a life in the city, and since then has run a series of successful shops -- antique, used bookstores, etc. Despite this, he has never felt that he quite fit in in the world.When Davey was a kid, Allen and his brothers murdered him. All of the brothers helped, because Davey was a monster, and had killed Allen's first girlfriend. After several years of happiness, Davey returned from the dead, a rotting monster. Now, after many years, EFG have come to Allen's new house, which he has restored in order to write a novel. They are scared, because George is gone, and if he is not inside of them, they can't eat. They think that Davey has taken and possibly killed him. Over the next few days Allen tries to help them, though E and F disappear too. During this time, one of the college-aged kids next door, Krisha, begins to taunt Allen, and implies that he knows where Allen's brothers are. Allen generally likes the kids who live next door; there is Natalie, a skinny little punk girl who gets along with Allen, Link, her brother, Krisha, who Allen does not like, and who does not like him, and Mimi, who allen is very attracted to, and who we discover has wings. Shortly after EFG have all gone missing, Allen is trying to find them, and he meets Kurt, a local cyber-punk. Kurt is attempting to set-up a mesh-network, which is a large-scale Wi-fi network. This network would give everyone in the city free internet connectivity. Kurt builds most of his equipment with old components he gets dumpster diving; in fact, he makes his living by dumpster diving and having the local street-kids sell what he finds on E-Bay. Davey continues to hunt and torment Allen, gradually taking away everything and everyone he loves. We discover that Kurt is Davey's \"Renfield,\" the character from Dracula who worships the vampire. Link is also drawn into Davey's plan, becoming a \"Renfield\" to Krishna. At the climax of the book, Davey attempts to burn down Kurt's home, but Allen saves him - only to realize that his own house is on fire. He rushes home, and with the help of Brian and Kurt, makes it in time to find Krisha beating Link with a hammer, and Davey there as well. Natalie shows up and attacks Krishna, taking the claw-end of the hammer to the head, just above her eye. This gives Allen time to attach Krishna, however, and Allen beats him handily. He tells Krishna that he picked the wrong man to Renfield for, as Allen is a monster as well -- he just doesn't look it. Krishna runs off, as Allen is attacked by Davey. Brian tries to egg Allen on, just as he did in the first murder (his part in the first murder was to tell Allen how his brother killed Allen's girlfriend, so that Allen would have the courage to kill him.) In this case, Brian tries to egg Allen on by telling him how Mimi, who Allen has fallen in love with, is burning to death right then in the house. Davey counters by telling Allen that Brian always egged him on, telling him where Allen and his girlfriend were, and what they were doing, teaching young Davey curse words, etc. Allen realizes that Brian was as bad as Davey all along. Just then Mimi crashes through the upstairs window, her wings (which she normally cut off) big enough to actually fly with. She grabs Allen and flies him to safety, leaving Allen and Davey to run away below. Mimi and Allen begin a new happy life on Craig, Allen's brother/island. Kurt survives the encounter, and goes on to realize his dream of networking the city. Natalie survives and takes over a video store where she has been working. They all live happily, but Davey and Brian are still at large when the book ends...Interesting things about the book's structure:The author makes use of a lot of jumping around in time and space; he usually does this without much preamble -- sometimes simply skipping backwards or forwards in time 20 years, with only a little whitespace between paragraphs. The trick here is that he also uses the whitespace when he is simply ending a \"chapter\" or \"section\" of the book, so you never know for a few sentences exactly where or when you are. Doctrow also uses a device where he writes a sentence, then in parentheses tells how the character is feeling. He then repeats the same sentence, then in parentheses expands on how the character is feeling. Kind of like this: I am hungry, (looking into the kitchen to see if there were any cookies on the counter.) I am hungry, (but the food that he ate most recently wasn't food at all, was it?) He sometimes repeated the sentence five or six times, and wrote several sentences in parentheses. Recurring images/themes/other things:The desire to be \"normal,\" and to fit in. What \"normal\" is. Losing your individuality in the face of becoming normal. How technology is changing the world. Free-speech, and using the internet to exercise that freedom.What I thought of the book:I really liked it. It was very strange, but Doctrow was able to take a bizarre concept like this, and make you actually care about the characters, and look forward to reading what will happen to them next. It was a really cool book."}, {"userName": "Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/170901-morgan", "userReview": "(Because Sean Cote is evil.)I loved the premise for the book, which was all the information I could get about it when Sean handed it to me in the midst of a barrage of props tasks for the day. I mean, who comes up with things like that? Amazing.It started off great. I love Alan's flashbacks, detailing his life as an outsider and what it was like living at home.But then all the technobabble entered the picture, all the stuff with the wireless access points that occupied a large proportion of the middle of the book. I thought Kurt's character was pretty cool, but I just couldn't figure out what was the point of the free wireless points. What did this have to do with a guy who didn't have a belly button? For the time, I tried to run with it, thinking that somehow Doctorow was going to pull it all back in and connect and it was going to be pretty cool and maybe a little mind-blowing.The payoff did not live up to my expectations.That's it? I thought. He spent all that valuable time detailing Kurt and Alan's journey setting up the wireless network and that's ALL IT HAS TO DO with the main storyline?It wasn't even really all that interesting, either. I mean, he could've gotten a pretty good character out of Kurt, and even Lyman, but the rest just seemed like Doctorow geeking out, maybe some personal manifesto on wireless networks or something, I don't know.I mean, I like rock'n'roll history, and I like incorporating it into my own writing, but seriously, I try not to be that tangential about it. At times it felt like Doctorow was writing two stories, this cool really different fantasy thing . . . and then a story about two guys who set up a wireless connection thing in their small Canadian town. And I don't know of many people who'd read the second story for its excitement value.And there was something about the ending that felt a little rushed. Some very interesting information came out, but that was it and then it was over. Very shotgun wedding of an ending. I really wanted a closer look at the Benny-Davey relationship, because it kinda came out of left field at the end, and it seemed pretty important but there wasn't much information to digest, so nothing really made sense.I also wanted to know a little more about Krishna, what it was about him that let him see Alan and Mimi for who they really were. I mean, there had to be something really interesting about Krishna that he could sense these things, because he had the potential to be a really interesting character, very sinister and unpredictable, and actually he was just kinda lame and negative.I think there were a lot of great things in this book, and that there was some incredible potential in it, but Doctorow just didn't put that potential to the best use.What I really did like, though, was that it's never explicitly explained what Alan is, what it is that makes him so different from humanity, his own little specialty among his brothers, but by the end you have a pretty good idea of what he might be and could have been.I also really liked when Mimi and Alan told each other stories, how they start three times and you catch a glimpse of what's happening while they tell the story. Really great.But the best part of this book is this:\"All secrets become deep. All secrets become dark. That's in the nature of secrets.\""}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036930-michael", "userReview": "Aldus's dad is a mountain and his mom is a washing-machine.

He meets his neighbors, a bunch of punks who think he's extremely strange. Because he is. He's very interested in one of the girls that lives there, and one night when he's out with her, he finds out she has wings which her boyfriend saws off for her so she can seem normal.All of this is well and good, and interesting. As you can probably tell from this overview, this is a story about not fitting in, but trying very hard to do so. As a metaphor, the whole thing is very interesting. This is magical realism, and I like it. What this book lacks is a compelling plot. There IS a plot, it's just not compelling. The dead brother has apparently come back, and is lurking around being creepy. And Alfie (the main character's name is different every time, but always begins with an A) meets an anarchist sort of dude who wants to create a wireless network that gives all of Toronto free wireless internet. This also functions as part of the metaphor. . . Abraham wants to be connected with all the \"normal\" people out there. . .but it just ain't interesting. Here we have an unusual, if not especially likeable, character, and he has a fascinating family, and struggles with issues that we all struggle with. But, every time he starts talking about the fucking internet, I get REALLY bored. And, every time Davie (the evil brother) does something creepy, I just wonder why ol' Dallas (his name also changes) is even in the book. At the end, I still don't know. Nor do I understand why I was supposed to give a fuck about wireless internet. Or the girl with the wings. Or Doyle. I might have harsher feelings about this book because it took months to finish; Joy and I read it out loud before bed whenever the mood struck us. So, this 300-pager seemed to drag on forever. But, it might be a sign about the compellingness of the plot that we weren't tempted to read it frequently at all. After finishing it, Joy shrugged, and I said, \"Well, that's that.\" We're very ready to move on to something else.

Alan has moved into a house in Toronto (coincidentally Doctorow's hometown) and meets a punk named Kurt trying to blanket Toronto in free WiFi. Alan strikes up a quick friendship with him and helps him try to achieve a network-ed Toronto while dealing with the layabouts who live next door.One of whom happens to have wings.At the same time, Alan is fending off assaults from his undead brother who is randomly kidnapping the Russian-nesting-doll brothers who have come to take shelter at his house.Have I mentioned that this book is weird?While a great many of the plot points seem to come out of nowhere or strain suspension of disbelief, this seems to be more a case of writing imitating life than sheer randomosity.Just like life, the book isn't just a drama, or a fantasy, or a romance, and Doctorow's writing reflects that. The comedic moments are written wittily, the erotic moments sexily, the pensive moments solemnly, and so on.In real life we don't always get closure. We don't always know why what happens happens. We frequently have no idea who the hell we're talking to, really.Doctorow seems to be trying to illustrate this universal truth with his plot...which features the child of a mountain and a washing machine, and a girl with wings. Go figure.The only thing that I really couldn't digest was the conclusion, which seemed a complete departure from Alan's character. I'd elaborate, but spoilers and the fact that my nitpick occurs over less than two pages dissuade me.In sum: This is a really surprisingly engrossing speculative fiction novel that would've been terrible and torturous if written by any but a select few authors.

While I liked it a little more than I did the last go round, I just am not into the story as much as I want to be. I understand what he is doing with the names (A,B,C,D) I'm just not being able to keep the ever-changing character names in my head as to what wacky and ridiculous character-type they link to. This is making it hard, as a reader, to be able to follow the plot when you are constantly trying to figure out who/what these characters are.March Assignment: Read to the scene break on p. 72I know that some members of the book club think this book is great, but I have to admit that I am hopelessly lost and keep forgetting who is a nesting doll and who/what Davie is. And now it's more characters with the same first letter of the name to make things even more confusing. Yeah, I'm just not a fan, even tho I really want to like it.April Assignment: Read to the scene break on p. 101For the love of all things holy, as if the perpetual name changing isn't enough, we have seemingly ranndom timeline shifts! I'm hopelessly loss and have resigned myself to slogging through until this book is blissfully voted off.Blissfully, this book was voted off in April!"}, {"userName": "Howard", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/944528-howard", "userReview": "Fine modern fantasy from up and coming sf writer and happening web editor at boingboing.net, with the potential to please both sf and mainstream readers.This chimera of a novel combines a plot with the geek appeal of a Neal Stephenson novel with a touching family story built out of absudist elements that might have come from Italo Calvino or Kurt Vonnegutt. We first meet Alan in Toronto, after he has made some money running a series of vaguely bohemian enterprises\u2014-bookstores; used clothing stores; etc.. He has painstakingly renovated a house in the student district to be the perfect setting for writing. He is distracted by his neighbors; primarily the sadistic punk Krishna, who is immediately hostile, and Krishna\u2019s girlfriend, Mimi, an attractive young woman who is revealed to have a set of wings, which Krishna regularly hacks off so that Mimi might pass among us. Both recognize Alan as something other than normal, and in the story\u2019s other thread, they\u2019re proven right. His mother was a washing machine, his father the mountain in which he grew up. Among his brothers are an island and three nesting doll-like creatures, all of whom help Alan murder their resentful and dangerous brother, David. Alan is further distracted when he meets Kurt, a techno-punk slowly installing wireless access points throughout the city to provide universal free internet, a scheme that immediately engages Alan, who becomes the co-mastermind. Crisis blossoms when, with Krishna as his Renfrew, decomposing brother David returns seeking revenge, first by murdering the brothers, and then targeting Mimi, now with Alan, and Kurt.Smart, clever, delightful stuff; it falls short of perfect\u2014-for some reason, alone in the book, the otherwise convincing Mimi tells her story in a distractingly written manner\u2014-but it still stands to be one of the better non-magic-and-dragon fantasies this year."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1594816-bruce", "userReview": "There were moments when I was thinking, 5 star book? But no... while this book was a very enjoyable read, something I was glad to read rather than having felt like I was just sort of killing time in a not unpleasant fashion, 3 star style, it has a couple of flaws.First, it is a novel of x,y,z, and internet connectivity. The IC is a hobbyhorse of the author, but does not actually contribute anything to the plot of this book, other than to give the protagonist an excuse for a friend. Second, weak ending. Only one real transformative bit there, with a non-protagonist, no one else really changes, many things are unresolved, it just sort of ends.Some good sex scenes. Some clever writing. Some interesting psychology. Some annoying writing quirks that may be code for some secret meaning I can't be bothered to figure out (protagonist and brothers names keep changing, they are identifiable by the first letter of the name, which also indicates birth order.).Definitely Fantasy, contemporary, not sci fi in any way shape or form.NOTE: to all my pals who sent or allowed goodreads to send me emails for so long begging me to join-- LAME! None of you are updating your content here. Spending too much time on facebook? The exception is Sebastian, who is pumping out ratings, all 5 stars, no reviews. I guess this is of some limited utility, but really at this point I think I am just putting this stuff up here for my own benefit. Not a bad idea, since I am now reading a lot of books from the library rather than buying them, and this provides me with a record, as long as it's up here anyway."}, {"userName": "Snail in Danger (Sid) Nicolaides", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/125150-snail-in-danger-sid-nicolaides", "userReview": "I first read this around the time that it was new. And even though it's only been seven years, the tech-related parts of it already feel kind of dated. Laptops are still a thing, but smartphones are so much more of a thing that it seems odd that the characters in this story are so incredulous about phones being used to do Internet stuff.I remember being blown away at the time that I read it. The city-wide wifi network built by homeless kids and a professional dumpster diver; the name-shifting characters, most of whom are the sons of a mountain and a washing machine; the girl who has wings and hates them.It's still interesting and impressive. Maybe more a 3.5, partly because it's a little weak at the end. But very Bordertown-ish, with the street kids and the incomprehensible fantastical beings. At the time I hadn't read the earlier Bordertown anthologies, though, so I didn't know what I was looking at. Technially I should probably compare this to \"Shannon's Law\" but the two works are so different in feel that I can't quite bring myself to do it."}, {"userName": "Ken", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10992684-ken", "userReview": "I started reading this book a couple of times, but just recently completed a successful run at it. I enjoy it - yet it wasn't quite a four-star read for me, though it was wonderfully inventive and unique.It's a fable-like story, and that's both a good thing and a bad thing. The characters are clever on the surface, but they remain archetypal - even the more \"ordinary\" ones feel less like people and more like sketches. This seems largely intentional - but still, it's distancing. Like Russian nesting dolls and washing machines, they have a hollowness which is functional but which I continued to find forcibly distancing. I couldn't get a feel for how anyone ticked or what they might want for themselves outside the scope of the story itself. Despite that, it was memorable and had its own distinct voice - it's good. Just not quite my jam, though I'd really like to hear what other people loved about it, just in case I'm missing something."}, {"userName": "LynAnne Smucker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1962008-lynanne-smucker", "userReview": "At first I really didn't like the main character, but as the book went on I realized that part of what I didn't like about him was that he was so controlling, but in a polite sort of creepy way. However, as the book progressed, and Alan's past story unfolds you begin to understand why he is who/what he is.

HOW CAN ANYONE PASS THAT UP??? OK...this is 2 stories, one is just weird and one is some techno wireless utopian blather. The 2 stories do not seem to have anything to do with each other, which seriously disrupts the flow of the story. So yeah....pops is a mountain. Literally a massive stone slab raised out of the earth.

Doctorow\u2019s writing pulls you in and I\u2019m a believer, but I haven\u2019t been able to convince my library patrons of his chops, due to his far out topics. A family of strange creatures goes to live in a new town. Some of the children live inside of each other, some are evil and all of them live in a cave, trying to pass for human, though the homo sapiens in the tale are the evil folk. The main character meets someone even further outside of normalcy; someone desperate to keep their vestigial wings a secret. As enemies surface who threaten their way of life, the plot picks up speed. The story however, is so difficult to encapsulate for potential readers, that I\u2019ve had no luck convincing anyone else to read it.

At times, especially near the start, I was all for giving up, which is something I hate doing. The book was a two star book up until we finally got to hear the story of Mimi, where things got way more interesting. Unfortunately, the book then switched back suddenly to talking about the whole free WiFi thing. It picked up again though, and I loved the ending. Overall, I wish Mimi's character had more presence in the first half of the novel. She was by far my favourite character. And the the whole name thing... I get what the point of it was, but it was more annoying than anything else.

I could try to explain it as Lovecraftian horror meets hacktivist manifesto via home improvement manual on top of a family saga with a love story or two thrown into the mix. It makes more sense to just give up.The thing is, Doctorow can really write. He writes characters that I don't like or identify with, yet I still had to know what happens to them. He describes revolting situations and makes you feel their homely attraction. And he can keep up the suspense so that I wasn't sure whether to expect a happy or a tragic ending until the last few pages.Not for everyone, but what is?"}], "description": "Alan is a middle-aged entrepeneur in contemporary Toronto, who has devoted himself to fixing up a house in a bohemian neighborhood. This naturally brings him in contact with the house full of students and layabouts next door, including a young woman who, in a moment of stress, reveals to him that she has wings--wings, moreover, which grow back after each attempt to cut them off.Alan understands. He himself has a secret or two. His father is a mountain; his mother is a washing machine; and among his brothers are a set of Russian nesting dolls.Now two of the three nesting dolls, Edward and Frederick, are on his doorstep--well on their way to starvation, because their innermost member, George, has vanished. It appears that yet another brother, Davey, who Alan and his other siblings killed years ago, may have returned...bent on revenge.Under such circumstances it seems only reasonable for Alan to involve himself with a visionary scheme to blanket Toronto with free wireless Internet connectivity, a conspiracy spearheaded by a brilliant technopunk who builds miracles of hardware from parts scavenged from the city's dumpsters. But Alan's past won't leave him alone--and Davey is only one of the powers gunning for him and all his friends.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.", "title": "Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9088841-someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town", "average": 3.51, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1315803468l/9088841.jpg", "reviews": 351, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12581.Cory_Doctorow", "name": "Cory Doctorow"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9088841-someone-comes-to-town-someone-leaves-town", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588.Someone_Comes_to_Town_Someone_Leaves_Town", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/838896.Someone_Comes_to_Town_Someone_Leaves_Town", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/954674.Little_Brother", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20575446-in-real-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29587.Down_and_Out_in_the_Magic_Kingdom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12917338-homeland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7241373-for-the-win"]}
