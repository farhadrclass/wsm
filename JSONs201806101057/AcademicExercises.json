The Renaissance-ish fantasy setting is rich and enjoyable, but the meat of the story is in the complex relationship between two renowned composers, as their fortunes shift. Definitely going to seek out more from this author. (Just ordered two more books!)' Loved just as much if not more, the second time around!***** A Rich, Full WeekAn adept is sent out by the Brotherhood to investigate and deal with a report of a village plagued by an undead. It's not an unusual assignment for one in his position, but it is his first time dealing with this specific kind of problem. Excellent characterization & thoughtfulness elevates this a good step above most tales with a 'vampire-hunter confronts monster' theme. ***** Amor Vincit OmniaRe-read; previously read in Strahan's 2011 'Year's Best' anthology, when I said, \"A very classic fantasy tale of power struggles amongst wizards. It's also very good; I loved the conclusion.\"The idea of the story is summed up in this quote, \"If a man exists who is immune to force, even if he's the most blameless anchorite living on top of a column in the middle of the desert, he is beyond government, beyond authority, and cannot be controlled; and that would be intolerable.\"The wizards in this story have all kinds of spells which can be used as terrible weapons - but they have never been able to discover a universal defense. They argue about whether such a thing is even possible, But now, an untrained, wild talent is rumored to have discovered the secret. And the wild talent is no peaceful hermit, but a mad killer. Brother Framea is sent to investigate. Along the way, as Parker loves to do, there's quite a lot of commentary of the subjects of ethics and corruptibility.On SiegesInformative essay on the history of siege warfare.**** Let Maps to OthersAnother re-read...\"Another excellent short story by Parker, which makes me pleased that I ordered two books from this author since reading \"A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong.\" This is similar in feel There are really two parts to this story - the first explores academic competition and one-upmanship, taken to a disturbing level. The second, following from the results of the first, probes literal exploration, and the consequences of obsession - with a heaping dose of irony.\"Three hundred years ago, an explorer returned from a newly-discovered land, Essecuivo, with tales of fabulous riches and favorable trade agreements. However, the coordinates of this place were kept secret - and lost. Fortunes were made and lost in speculative ventures and investments in future expeditions. Nothing ever came of them. Now, our narrator is a scholar, known as the foremost expert on Essecuivo (the little that's known of it). His career has been dedicated to it, his personal obsession with the topic has been lifelong. But he has a rival who hates him...**** A Room with a ViewA wizard-scholar who's, shall we say, not the most successful graduate that the Studium has churned out, is given an unenviable assignment: he has to check a large number of dogs for the unlikely signs of demonic possession, before the animals can legally be cleared for sale. Not only is this an onerous, tedious, and near-pointless task, he has to also train a junior student how to do the job, meaning he can't even slack off. But when this student he's supposed to be mentoring arrives, he's in for a surprise... not only is she a woman, but something seems strange about her...Cutting Edge TechnologyExtremely interesting and entertaining essay on the history of swordmaking and the techniques of swordfighting. **** IlluminatedOn assignment, instructed only to \"investigate,\" an arrogant, chauvinistic wizard and his junior assistant are looking into a remote, abandoned tower. It looks like this tower was inhabited, not terribly long ago, by a rogue wizard. From the evidence found in a difficult-to-decipher manuscript, it looks like this wizard, in a situation eerily mirroring that of the investigators', also had a talented but inexperienced female trainee. And his experiments with new spells may have been less than ethical.*****Purple and BlackAn epistolary novella consisting mainly of correspondence between two young school friends - one of whom has recently unexpectedly become emperor, and the other of whom has been appointed governor of a province by that emperor. While the letters concern matters of politics and affairs of state, the tone is the chatty, informal one one might expect from best friends, and also have to do with keeping up with mundane personal topics and keeping up with other members of their little school clique...And somehow, along the way, the story twists from an entertainingly gossipy glimpse into the politics of empire, into a musing on the nature of power and the fate of idealism. Excellently done.Rich Men\u2019s SkinsAn essay on the history of armor. A good companion to the previous essay on swordsmithing.**** The Sun and IA re-read.I really enjoy KJ Parker's style. This is a fun and irony-filled tale of a group of dissipated young men who decide to start a new religion as a way to jump-start their cash flow. However, when the scheme succeeds past their wildest dreams, the joke might end up being on them - or on the world at large.**** One Little Room an EverywhereOur protagonist is a graduate from the Studium (KJ Parker's school for wizards [or maybe scientists], which is a recurring feature in his fiction), but has barely scraped through graduation by the skin of his teeth. He's simply unable to master many of the expected skills, and is certainly not going to get a job placement. His advisor counsels him to go into another field - a non-magical one. The arts maybe, or accounting.Naturally, our narrator is disappointed. Were his years of study wasted? Nevertheless, he seems to take his advisor's advice, and goes into painting religious icons. But, he didn't actually graduate from the Studium without learning anything. He's got a \"cheat\" - a forbidden spell. As his fame and fortune grows, one would think he'd managed to grasp the best of both worlds. But there's always a catch, isn't there?**** Blue and GoldKJ Parker revisited the character of Saloninus, introduced here, in 'The Devil You Know,' which I read a few months ago. I understand why - it's a great character! (Imagine if Leonardo da Vinci had been an amoral conman and alchemist?) If you've read either one, some of the details here will be familiar to you.I did think that 'The Devil You Know' was slightly better, but this one was great too.KJ Parker's wry cynicism regarding human nature is on display in top form, in this story. The narrator tells you upfront that he's unreliable: a liar, a criminal, and not to be trusted. He also tells us that he discovered the secret of transmuting base metals to gold, and that he murdered his wife. Should we believe either of these things?Along the way, Saloninus' stories shift a bit - sometimes more than a bit - but they're always entertaining. I liked the commentary on how discovering the secret of how to create gold might not really be the best thing for its discoverer... along with many other gems."}, {"userName": "G33z3r", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7136749-g33z3r", "userReview": "[Carchedonius tossing the long-sought after ancient manuscript into the fire rather than have it proved his rival correct.

Parker is an author whose prose I\u2019ve always enjoyed; on the other hand, nobody else ever seems to have read any of their work, and that is, frankly, a crime. As such, today we\u2019re going to talk about Parker\u2019s short fiction anthology, \u2018Academic Exercises\u2019 \u2013 which doesn\u2019t require any knowledge of existing series to read through, and is, not to give the game away, really rather good.The text collects a variety of Parker\u2019s short fiction; some of it has been available before in the form of novella (e.g. \u2018Purple and Black\u2019, an epistolary tale of ambition, power and trust), and some of it has even been made available for free in the publisher\u2019s ongoing magazine (the marvellous \u2018Let Maps to Others\u2019, discussing the value and necessity of document authenticity, in a thick stew of revenge). There\u2019s also a set of work I hadn\u2019t seen before, which may well mean it\u2019s new \u2013 it\u2019s certainly new to me.So, what makes this anthology worth reading? Immediately, two things: first, the quality of Parker\u2019s prose. Each story is written in the first person, and each inner monologue is presented with their own voice \u2013 across all the different stories, the narrators are easily distinguishable from each other, which is quite an achievement. Tonally, the narrators are quite similar \u2013 there\u2019s a dry, grim, resigned wit that permeates Parker\u2019s work, and whilst it\u2019s rarely laugh-out-loud funny, it\u2019s often amusing.At the same time, the words themselves are a pleasure to read \u2013 well crafted, with excellent description of both worlds and ancillary characters. The latter are perhaps not as well drawn as the main characters \u2013 but that may be a factor of the first person narrative form.So, the first reason to read Parker\u2019s work is that the setting is well drawn, the characters feel like people, and the whole is both cohesive and a pleasure to read.What\u2019s the second reason?Parker unflinchingly approaches larger themes through their characters, and unrelentingly pursues all sorts of complex aspects of the human experience. The stories aren\u2019t afraid to talk about history, for example \u2013a bout what makes a thing authentic, and what makes people that way too. It doesn\u2019t shy away from philosophy, and several of the narratives explore the strands of thought around the question of whether the motivation for actions matters, or merely the result. Alongside these broader themes there are characters who are very clever indeed, and use that cleverness to drive their own actions \u2013 in many cases, dragging the reader after them kicking and screaming. By no means does \u201cintelligent\u201d equate with \u2018nice\u2019. Within these characters, the author throws in a lot fo the deeper human emotions \u2013 fear, loss, pride, revenge, and drills into their often catastrophic effect on the human condition. Each protagonist is convincingly portrayed, and the end result is that I, for one, couldn\u2019t stop turning pages.Parker is also a wonderful writer of the twist denouement; this is less obvious in their other work, but most, if not all of the short stories presented here have at least one sting in the tail. This is perhaps an issue, in the context of reading the entire collection back-to-back; I started looking for plot twists, even expecting them, rather than just letting them surprise me \u2013 but that\u2019s not a fault of the stories themselves, so much as an observance of a common theme in the author\u2019s work.There\u2019s a few non-fiction articles thrown in here for good measure, on the rise and development of weapons and armour \u2013 and these are written in the same accessible style, and quite entertaining. It would be nice to see the references used for these, but in context, they\u2019re still very interesting.At any rate, at the close of the book, I\u2019d say K.J. Parker is writing some of the smartest, sharpest, most well observed prose available in the genre today \u2013 and that this collection would serve as a good intro to their style and body of work, if you wanted to dip your toe in the water."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5624286-christine", "userReview": "not available to buy atmA Small Price to Pay for Birdsong available via http://subterraneanpress.comA Rich, Full Week available via http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/ in print + audio I really enjoyed the audio version of this. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665Amor Vincit Omnia available via http://subterraneanpress.comOn Sieges http://subterraneanpress.comLet Maps to Others via http://subterraneanpress.comCutting Edge Technology via http://subterraneanpress.comIlluminated via http://subterraneanpress.com \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665Rich Mens Skins via http://subterraneanpress.comThe Sun and I via http://subterraneanpress.comOne Little Room an Everywhere via http://www.nightshadebooks.com"}, {"userName": "Teresa Edgerton", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6677217-teresa-edgerton", "userReview": "This collection includes ten pieces of short fiction and three essays. I found the quality of the stories uneven: some were exceptional (\"Let Maps to Others,\"\"The Sun and I,\" and the remarkable \"A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong\"), others enjoyable enough but by themselves nothing special.Except \u2026 well, except that in this case the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The characters in these stories face moral and ethical dilemmas, challenges to their artistic and academic integrity, reap the unexpected consequences of good (and bad) intentions, betray, are betrayed ... so that, in combination, the stories add up to a brilliant exploration of all these themes and how each relates to the others.In the process, Parker introduces a varied cast: philosophers, alchemists, academics, and magicans; rogues, confidence men, and opportunists. There are no answers here, only ambiguities and bitter ironies. The convolutions of the longer stories (each with several twists before the end) can be hard to follow, but are ultimately worth the effort.If the rating system allowed, I'd give this book a 4 1/2."}, {"userName": "Metaphorosis", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7706283-metaphorosis", "userReview": "Metaphorosis Reviews3.5 starsI've noted before that K.J. Parker is a formulaic writer. He approaches each story with almost exactly the same blend of irony, fatalism, and humor. All his stories and novels have the same general feel. He gets away with it because it's an effective formula, and because there's just enough that's new to maintain our interest. He also introduces substantial and thorough background information.This collection contains the first non-fiction I've seen from Parker - detailed essays on siegecraft, armor, and weaponry. They echo the detail that comes through in his stories, and confirm that Parker has dug deeply into his topics; he's not just looking things up on Wikipedia.The stories work, in my view, better than the novels, because they provided more variability in setups and characters. The tone is consistent, but the scenery is more interesting. We also get some insight into the fairly vague magic system Parker has used in several pieces, and into the geography of Parker's vague shared world.It's a bit of a mystery to me why I keep coming back to Parker, considering the criticisms above, but the fact is that while he is following a formula, he's following it really well. I'd wish for a lot more variation in tone, but the rest of the stories and characters is compelling and well constructed. One problem in reviewing an anthology, unfortunately, is that the stories all run together. Because of the flat tone, no one story is particularly memorable. That said, my favorites were:  A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong - largely because it deals with music, which is a bit of a change for Parker. \n   Amor Vincit Omnia - because it digs a little deeper into the magic system the stories follow. \n   The Sun and I - the most fully developed characters of the set, and an interesting look at the backstory to some of the other pieces."}, {"userName": "Ananda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6762068-ananda", "userReview": "Amazing short fiction and nonfiction collection by one of my favorite fantasy writers. Unlike most short story collections this one isn't uneven at all; every story is engaging and challenging. The stories are mostly set in the vaguely shared Renaissance fantasy universe Parker has created, but without much reference to any specific events in other books, so everything stands alone nicely. As the title suggests, most of the main characters in these stories are scholars and academics, and the stories tell of how they use and abuse their learning.Strongly recommended."}, {"userName": "Liviu", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229019-liviu", "userReview": "omnibus collection of almost all short stories, novellas and short novels (including Purple Black and Blue Gold) from the author; brilliant stuff sure, the only drawback being no original stories for this anthology and as I read everything here as originally published in various venues, all of the book's content was familiar; still nice having them under one coversee also:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."}, {"userName": "Doug", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2377087-doug", "userReview": "Reading through this anthology by one of my favourite writers and I'll try to keep my thoughts on each story/essay up-to-date as I go. I've read a couple of the longer ones before, but I might reread them because, well...Parker. Duh. (Should note that most of these stories are available for free on Subterranean Press' website, for those interested. I think Purple and Black and Blue and Gold are the only ones not...)A Small Price to Pay for BirdsongThe first of two winners of the World Fantasy Award for best novella in this collection and it's easy to see why it a) Won and b) was chosen to open the anthology. It's a remarkable piece that really manages to boil down Parker's style; thematically well-rounded and thought-provoking, while remaining funny and philosophical. The narrator is, as always with Parker, both a fantastic character and a literary device. I think perhaps most interesting for me in this story was what seemed the obvious homage to another (in)famous short story, Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart. Though Parker remains unique throughout, of course. Really superb and completely deserving of its WFA. A Rich, Full WeekWeirdly, this was actually my first exposure to Parker. I read it originally a few years back in the Swords and Dark Magic anthology and it made a big impression. On rereading it\u2019s certainly not Parker\u2019s best (hard to imagine it could be!) but it\u2019s a very fun story that uses magic (something Parker almost never does or even alludes to) and even has zombies. Parker\u2019s zombies, that is. It\u2019s even a bit wacky, and again has a narrator who is very much central to the narrative, rather than a passive cypher. I\u2019d love to see more of Parker\u2019s magic in the future, even though there\u2019s no such thing\u2026 All in all a good breather after the intensity of A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong, and it also has a cracker of an ending.Amor Vincit OmniaPerhaps the most directly \u2018academic\u2019 story so far \u2013 despite Birdsong actually featuring an academic \u2013 Amor Vincit Omnia (\u2018Love Conquers All\u2019) is also one of the stranger Parker stories I\u2019ve read. There\u2019s less deception involved (at least between POV and reader) and instead Parker is more intent on showing off the pointless nature of academia. There\u2019s some action, humour and lots of latin-ish stuff in here. It\u2019s one of the more awkward Parker stories I\u2019ve read, but luckily it is placed brilliantly in this anthology. With the foundations of Parker\u2019s world\u2019s academia and \u2018magic\u2019 laid down in the previous two stories, this one resonates a lot more than it would reading it cold. On SiegesThis is the first of three essays in the collection, and it\u2019s a mighty fine (and typically Parker-esque) look into the basic history of military sieges. There was lots of stuff in here I\u2019d never really considered before, and some really nice little factoids. It\u2019s all tied together by Parker\u2019s very natural scholarly prose \u2013 not excluding her knack for irony. I would happily pay for more of Parker\u2019s non-fiction, and for all we know there may just be lots more out there. Let Maps to OthersThis may just be my favourite of Parker's novellas. The voice is easily as strong as that of the main character in Blue and Gold, but there is a lot more substance in the plot. It has all the Parker staples: snarky MC, holier-than-thou scholars, dark humour, a clever structure, a slow-building plot that gets more and more tangled in its own web and a really quite deep exploration of many things, like academia, exploration and economics. It's probably the best starting point for reading Parker (along with perhaps The Folding Knife and A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong) as it's quite substantial at around 75 pages and incredibly satisfying with an ending that really pays off. Brilliant stuff.A Room with a View A bit Parker-lite this one. The story is interesting enough - and it includes that oh-so-rare thing: Parker magic. In fact, this story acts almost as Parker's treatise on his magic system, introducing us to the concept of 'Rooms' that act as physical-mental conduits between reality and magic. Conceptually its interesting and well executed, and there's a nice twist in there, but ultimately this is just a bit 'lesser' when read against the likes of Let Maps to Others or Purple and Black. Cutting Edge TechnologyEssay no.2, and once again Parker knocks it out of the park! I would read a whole book of these. It's an authoritative look at the history of swords and their uses in different cultures (and indeed, their ultimate 'usefulness'). It's just as snarky as you'd expect from KJP, and genuinely made me think about some of the things I take for granted in reading a lot of fantasy fiction. IlluminatedInteresting story, if a bit confusing. Parker returns to the teacher/pupil dynamic of A Room with a View, with quite a similar pair of characters. The narration jumps around between them and a third party. There's a bit more on Parker's magic system here (sidenote: I'm curious if it will come up in a future novel, because it's really well conceived) and it's one of Parker's more sinister stories. Indeed, I'd go as far as to say it's almost straight-up horror. I wasn't convinced by this one, but it might reward rereading.Purple and BlackI've read this novella before in its previous Subterranean Press edition, and reviewed it on my blog. In short I thought it was outstanding and one of Parker's best. (Copied from http://wildersbookreview.com/2014/05/... ):Purple and Black is an epistolary novella that focuses on the war dispatches sent between an emperor and his general in the field. For each entry there is a short, official military dispatch written in purple ink; but next to it \u2013 written in black ink (duh) \u2013 are the less official personal dispatches between these two old friends. As ever, Parker\u2019s writing is top-notch and clever to the point of annoying for any other writer out there, and slowly reveals both the world, relationships and underlying conspiracies behind the dispatches. Superb stuff. Rich Men's Skins: A Social History of ArmourAnother great essay from Parker here that looks at the realities of creating, developing, using, and in some cases 'perfecting' armour throughout the centuries. I think there was maybe a little less of Parker's trademark snarky wit in this one, though it was certainly evident in the footnotes. Again, really informative and, essentially, and academic essay that reads like it's written by someone with a sense of humour and an eye for being entertaining - something most academics don't really aim for. The Sun and IWow wow wow, what a great story. This is right up there with A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong and Let Maps to Others  - an absolutely terrific novella, I'm surprised that it didn't garner Parker another WFA, or at the very least a nomination. This is KJP on organised religion and man alive he does not hold any punches. A group of con men decide to create God and through a series of coincidental and lucky (or are they...) events quickly rise to be the prominent 'religion' of the world: The Invincible Sun. Yes, this is essentially Parker's creation myth, The Invincible Sun being a deity that pops up in almost every story or novel he has written. Narrated by another unreliable character, this is truly superb writing that I highly recommend anyone interested in Parker gives a shot. One Little Room an EverywhereA shorter interlude between the longer form stories that sandwich it, One Little Room an Everywhere is an interesting one. Well placed in the anthology as it in many ways takes a lot of what Parker has worked towards in the previous stories. The studium, his magic system, the Invincible Sun, the relationship between art-capitalism-religion, it's all here in a tight story once again told by - what else? - an unreliable narrator. Hard to sum this one up, and certainly not a story I'd recommend starting with, here a former student of the Studium decides to use a secret and dangerous spell he's come across/stolen (bit of a grey area) to create the finest works of iconography ever known to man, and sell them to the pious for obscene amounts of money. Only it seems that everywhere one of his works is placed something horrible happens...Definitely one of the better shorter stories by Parker, though it is hard to get away from the fact that he seems to work at the peak of his powers on novellas in that sweet spot of around 15k-30k words. Blue and GoldI've reviewed this one previously, here: https://wildersbookreview.wordpress.c...Blue and Gold is essentially Parker taking the whole device of using an unreliable narrator and doing his absolute best to twist it and play with every possible trope. Saloninus, a character we seem to have heard of in previous stories as some sort of historical figure, is easily the most devious of Parker's creations, telling the reader almost immediately that he is a liar and a cheat. This is probably the most outright 'fun' of Parker's novellas and a good one to end the anthology on, if only because its final line is one of the most devious I have ever had the pleasure to read. Concluding thoughtsWell, I've dipped in and out of this anthology over the last year or so, reviewing each story as I did so. If it isn't clear on reading my thoughts above, I'm an enormous fan of K.J. Parker, and this anthology is exactly the reason why. It is a seminal collection of fiction by one of the best writers out there right now, in any genre. His essays in this collection are hilarious and informative. His short stories are each unique and particularly in this format it is easy to see the development of his 'world' as the anthology plays out. But where Parker truly shines is in his novellas. Two World Fantasy awards is hardly a fluke, and indeed I'd happily argue that The Sun and I, and possibly even Purple and Black were deserving of the same or similar accolades. It's not easy to get ahold of this collection in hard copy anymore, limited as it was to 1000 copies, but the eBook is still available, and most of the stories are easily found with a quick google search. Start with A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong or  Let Maps to Others and find out for yourself why K.J. Parker is one of the best writers of fiction out there today."}, {"userName": "Logan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28038482-logan", "userReview": "I don't know anything about KJ Parker but he can really spin a good story. The humor is decidedly dry, with a good amount of tongue-in-cheek observations. I really enjoyed it. This collection of stories centers around people in academic situations (research, experiments, teaching, etc), but most of them seemed to be set in an alternate history where there is a type of \"science\" that really is a form of magic. Perhaps an alternate Byzantine period. There was also a really interesting section on the history and development of armor, and the history and development of the sword, both of which I found fascinating (and I admit that I am one of those sword enthusiasts who owns one simply so he can cut a plastic jug full of water).Anyway, really a great collection of short stories.A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong. 4 starsAbout a young protege who is a genius at creating music, which his professor labors at.

My favorites were \"A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong,\" \"Let's Map to Others,\" and the three essays on the history, social politics, and technology of siege warfare, swords, and armor. This kind of fascination with detail and engineering is a big element of Parker's work, though it's also brilliantly written and constructed.

All the stories in this take place in the same world, but in different countries, all tied together with mention to the Studium - a university that studies everything from philosophy and history to alchemy and magic. The stories are all great, with realistic characters, and hints at the magic system of the Studium (just enough to give a flavour of how it works, not enough to make it predictable). There's also a few essays in here, which I thought I would end up skipping, but they were fantastic, well written and interesting, didn't feel like a lecture or a college-essay. There's hints of the interconnectedness of the stories as they progress, references to previous ones, although the lack of a map or timeline makes it a little hard to tell how they fit together exactly.

Parker. There's a range of topics featured in the book, dealing with various arts, religion, magic, war, and even some non-fiction work which covers siege warfare, swords and armour.Although classified as a fantasy, it's not the typical worlds with imaginative creatures and magic spells. Instead, the humans which are gifted in magic don't see themselves as wizards, but as philosophers, specialising in mental energies. They often use these powers to exorcise demons.Most of the stories deal with similar characters, ones with personal failures which lead them into immoral situations.The majority of stories were really enjoyable and the non-fiction work was fascinating."}, {"userName": "Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3565251-crystal", "userReview": "Parker is one of my favorite authors, so this short story collection was a pleasure. Parker's short stories are a distillation of unique style involving brilliant machinations, magic, and clever plot twists. The three nonfiction essays included about siege warfare, swords, and armor were a surprise for me, since I didn't know the author wrote nonfiction. They add some important details to the realism of sword and sorcery fantasy. The fiction essays mostly seem to take place in the same world with the same kind of magic system, so more about the world is revealed through different stories.

As others have stated, accurately, it is a collection of short stories and novellas which all take place in a similar world, but also mixed in are three well constructed and argued treatises on aspects of medieval warfare (sieges, sword and armour technology). Putting aside the non-fiction portions for the time being, the stories are all set in a reality which seems to be at a technology level approximating to somewhere between 1500-1750AD. The political structures sound like the sort of city states that could be managed in a horse based transport infrastructure, the academic structures (the Studium, a neoligism I really liked) sound like a medieval University which teaches theology alongside sciences. The last story, centred on the activities of a rogue alchemist really helped with this feeling, with lots of old time chemical names which I could decode or understand from my own modern chemistry training.The fantasy elements in some of the stories revolved around the adepts trained by the Studium, who were capable of feats of magic science involving being able to use different 'rooms' to transcend reality and travel between places instantaneously, or check dogs for demonic possesion. As always with collections of short stories, there was some variance in how well each story worked, but having them tied together in a single reality meant that those stories which weren't quite as good as others still managed to be a part of a larger whole, and therefore worth the effort.The non-fiction sections were short discussions of practical aspects of medieval warfare. The first time I hit one I expected it to be a feed into a story which played on the information that had been imparted, but there are no stories which feature any of siege, swords or armour. However, I found these three dispassionate discussions felt like enjoyable interludes breaking up the stories.All in all, a good set of stories, entertaining and interesting."}, {"userName": "Marcheto", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26288737-marcheto", "userReview": "4.5 stars\u201cAcademic Exercises\u201d compiles some of K. J. Paker\u2019s most popular short stories and novellas. If you\u2019re already a fan of K. J. Parker, as it was my case before reading this book, you\u2019ll probably know most of these pieces, but that\u2019s not a reason for not reading this collection, as most of the stories are so brilliant that you\u2019ll enjoy them as much as the first time. If you\u2019re new to this author, this is the perfect starting place as you\u2019ll find here most of his best, most awarded and representative short fiction.K. J. Parker\u2019s stories are a pleasure to read. They\u2019re intelligent, witty, funny, sometimes even hilarious, and deeper than what they may seem at first sight, as they abound in incisive remarks about plenty of crucial issues (power, politics, religion, art\u2026 among many others). My only drawback is that as most of the stories have a similar setting, tone, narrator\u2019s voice and style, so they may seem a bit too similar if read at a single sitting. They\u2019re definitely better enjoyed reading one at a time.I\u2019d also like to highlight the three historical essays about swords, sieges and armors, which are as enjoyable as any of the fiction pieces.This is without any doubt the best collection (and one of the best books of any genre) I\u2019ve read so far this year.

They're fun to read, and can certainly be impactful in much the same way as novels can, in a fraction of the reading time.

Also striking is \"Purple and Black,\" a correspondence between a reluctant provincial governor and an even more reluctant emperor, erstwhile school friends, and what happens when an insurgency overruns the province. \"A Small Price to Pay for Birdsong,\" a tale of a musical genius and murderer who escapes from prison and the less talented composer who unwillingly helps him, is also good.

Parker is a relatively recent discovery of mine, and she (?) is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. Known for her dry cynicism, understated humor, and intriguing explorations of morality, her stories are set in a historically informed world fleshed out with Parker\u2019s rich historical knowledge.Collected here in her first anthology, Academic Exercises, her short fiction has so far won two World Fantasy Awards for her novellas \u201cA Small Price to Pay for Birdsong\u201d and \u201cLet Maps to Others.\u201d Included in this anthology are also three non-fiction essays on historical subjects such as siege warfare, and the history of swords, and armor.K.J. Parker\u2019s short fiction differs from her longer works in that they frequently feature magical elements, something that her longer works largely stay away from. Although some elements from her longer works are referenced in her short work, the link between them is tenuous and contradictory, making you wonder just how much is actually shared between them. I won\u2019t comment on every story included in this collection and will instead offer a short description and appraisal of the ones that I found most interesting. Most of the stories included here can be found online at Subterranean Online, and at the end of this piece you will find the full table of contents, with links to where you can read them, when available.Opening up the collection, \u201cA Small Price to Pay for Birdsong,\u201d one of her award-winning novellas, explores an interesting moral dilemma: If you could claim a masterpiece as your own without anyone finding out about it, would you do it? In his last hours alive, a genius composer, who has been sentenced to death, is visited in his cell by his professor, who, while being an expert in musical theory, is unable to compose any good music. The student has an unfinished Concerto, one that could very well be one of his best yet, but he doesn\u2019t want to finish it and the professor is left with an unfinished masterpiece in his hands. The story develops in a remarkable way, but it ends rather abruptly in a way that I did not find very satisfying.How do you kill someone who can\u2019t be killed? In \u201cAmor Vincit Omnia,\u201d reports begin appearing of someone with the ability (the name given to the ability to perform magic) who has escaped unharmed from every attempt to have him killed. The Studium, the place where those with the ability study their craft, decides that these reports are worth investigating, since they all seem to point in the same direction: Someone has cracked the secret to Lorica, a theoretically possible, but almost impossible to perform, spell that imbues its wearer with an impenetrable defensive shield. It is the job of the main character then to confirm if Lorica has indeed been achieved, and if so, to kill this person. It\u2019s an intelligent and suspenseful story, and it has an entirely satisfying, and incredibly clever, ending that made me grin like a madman when it happened.\u201cOn Sieges\u201d is the first non-fiction essay in the collection, out of three, and the one I most enjoyed. Siege warfare has always been an interest of mine and Parker is able to make the subject come alive with her words. It begins with how war was an important incentive for early civilizations to begin building cities, and ends up exploring how siege warfare was conducted throughout the ages. I wonder if there is a non-fiction book on warfare somewhere in K.J. Parker\u2019s future. It would certainly be a worthwhile read.My favorite story of the lot, and apparently Parker\u2019s first novella, Purple and Black is told in a series of military dispatches between two friends, one the emperor and the other a governor tasked with securing the frontier. While you might think the structure constraints of telling a story through military dispatches would make impossible the telling of an interesting and compelling story, Parker is a seasoned enough writer to not only work around those constraints, but to thrive on them. As usual with her stories, several ethical issues are raised in a way that weaves them with the story at hand and its climax, namely the corrupting nature of power.Imagine yourself with a group of friends, out of money and in desperate need of it. Assume for the sake of it that being an ethical person isn\u2019t of much interest to you. What schemes would you arrange with them to get yourselves out of that predicament? How about creating a new religion? It\u2019s an absurd idea but Parker\u2019s story \u201cThe Sun and I\u201d is perhaps the most important story in this collection for long-time K.J. Parker readers because this newly invented religion is none other than The Invincible Sun, a religious system which has been featured in many of her longer works.I would be surprised if Academic Exercises doesn\u2019t end up winning some awards. The collection features some of the most intriguing short fiction out there, by one of the most original voices being published today, and, fortunately, there is no indication that K.J. Parker\u2019s output will be diminishing any time soon. Academic Exercises has that \u2018unputdownable\u2019 quality to it that made me want to read it even when I probably should have been doing something else, and its tiny faults don\u2019t detract anything from its ingenious whole. A worthwhile read, even for readers who are new to K.J. Parker\u2019s work."}], "description": "Academic Exercises is the first collection of shorter work by master novelist K.J. Parker, and it is a stunner. Weighing in at over 500 pages, this generous volume gathers together thirteen highly distinctive stories, essays, and novellas, including the recent World Fantasy Award-Winner, \u201cLet Maps to Others\u201d. The result is a significant publishing event, a book that belongs on the shelf of every serious reader of imaginative fiction.The collection opens with the World Fantasy Award-winning \u201cA Small Price to Pay for Birdsong\u201d, a story of music and murder set against a complex mentor/pupil relationship, and closes with the superb novella \u201cBlue & Gold\u201d, which features what may be the most beguiling opening lines in recent memory. In between, Parker has assembled a treasure house of narrative pleasures. In \u201cA Rich, Full Week\u201d, an itinerant \u201cwizard\u201d undergoes a transformative encounter with a member of the \u201crestless dead.\u201d \u201cPurple & Black\u201d, the longest story in the book, is an epistolary tale about a man who inherits the most hazardous position imaginable: Emperor. \u201cAmor Vincit Omnia\u201d recounts a confrontation with a mass murderer who may have mastered an impossible form of magic.Rounding out the volume \u2014 and enriching it enormously \u2014 are three fascinating and illuminating essays that bear direct relevance to Parker\u2019s unique brand of fiction: \u201cOn Sieges\u201d, \u201cCutting Edge Technology\u201d, and \u201cRich Men\u2019s Skins\u201d.Taken singly, each of these thirteen pieces is a lovingly crafted gem. Together, they constitute a major and enduring achievement.
