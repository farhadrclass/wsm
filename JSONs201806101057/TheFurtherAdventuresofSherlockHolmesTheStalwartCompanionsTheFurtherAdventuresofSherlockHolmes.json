Although the personality of the Holmes rendered in this short story doesn't have the depth I usually hope for in this wonderful pastiches (as there is little time in so few pages), he was still true to form nonetheless. T.R. is a character massive enough to fit the bill perfectly as Holmes temporary Watson before Watson.Overall, it was worth the read, as in my mind, almost all Holmes stories are."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8671235-monica", "userReview": "Not bad but certainly not remarkable by any account, this story replaces Watson with Teddy Roosevelt and has New York filling for London. A couplr of hours reading and then you are done with it ... forever.

Paul Jeffers. This book came from my library and is a hardback that I bought in 1981 for fifty cents at K-Mart. I read it that same year. It got stored away here and there over the years. At some point, my son Nick read it and loaned it to a friend. The book traveled to Wheaton, Illinois and then to Austin, Texas before it came back home. Since it had been about 37 years since I read it and since I was looking for a fast, easy read, I re-read it this past week. There is something to be said for the book that is just fun. Jeffers, who wrote several biographical works on Theodore Roosevelt, created this work where TR joins in with none other than Sherlock Holmes to solve a murder case in New York. Jeffers is not Conan Doyle, but he did a credible job of putting Holmes in a historical context with Roosevelt.Sheer fun. Okay, it does also teach a bit of history about politics in the 1870s, but mostly just fun."}, {"userName": "Richard Schwindt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27960447-richard-schwindt", "userReview": "I have often claimed in reviews that the Sherlock Holmes pastiche is the easiest to do. A little, fog, a companion, a death, some mood, a few clich\u00e9s (\u201cThe game\u2019s afoot!), and you are good to go. This is not to say they are bad but rather like haiku in testing the author\u2019s creativity with a pre-determined format. The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes series runs with this idea; producing a number of titles; some thoughtful and some ridiculous. Sherlock Holmes and the Stalwart Companions places Holmes in New York City in 1880 during an acting gig, with his penpal Theodore Roosevelt. This is a pretty good idea and well executed by the author. A historian, he has an excellent grasp of the times and the subjects. He also seems determined to use half the book citing sources that prove that Holmes was a real historical figure. I suspect this latter piece would appeal to a hard core history buff but not everyone. That said, light your pipe and explore the story. Good fun."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2299896-lindsay", "userReview": "Before the days of the internet, fanfiction was published in magazines and books (if the source works were now public domain). I discovered these published Holmes fanfics on the bargain table at Barnes and Noble and this one at least has proved to be enjoyable. Mainly because I imagined Benedict Cumberbatch and the late Robin Williams teaming up. There's nothing really exceptional about the story or characters--though perhaps a history fan from that age would appreciate some nuances. Still, it was a pleasant work to sit on the porch and unwind with. An easy (and short) book to pick up and put down at leisure (while juggling other books) without feeling like you missed something important in the plot."}, {"userName": "Garrett Hamblin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60666846-garrett-hamblin", "userReview": "I loved the premise that one of my favorite presidents teamed up with one of my favorite literary sleuths to solve a murder mystery in 1880's New York. It is seen through the eyes of a couple of amateur historians who come across a diary of Teddy Roosevelt's describing his adventure with Sherlock Holmes. Of course, I always enjoy the vintage Holmes deductive reasoning and powers of observation, but what I found more fascinating was the political perspective that Roosevelt interjects throughout the novel. It's a fun old fashion mystery!"}, {"userName": "Janan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7002473-janan", "userReview": "Really a very well-written Holmes pastiche. I do think that Roosevelt mirrored Watson in some ways as far as being Holmes' companion in crime solving, but it only made sense for him to be narrating the story and since this was before the famous duo worked together at Baker Street, I believe it was perfectly sensible. Excellent storyline, it kept me moving through the pages just like an original work."}, {"userName": "Jack Perreault", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12892337-jack-perreault", "userReview": "A fun read.

In parts. I commend the author for their ability to successfully mimic Conan Doyle's description of Holmes' unique faculties, but my main issue with this novel comes from the premise and flow. This Sherlock novel involves a story within a story. We join A journalist & his Sherlockian fanatic friend upon discovery of proof of the existence of Sherlock Holmes via his involvement with Theodore Roosevelt when they were both young and pre-fame.Although the idea does sound promising, I personally found that it took too long for the account of the Sherlock investigation to take part. It is my opinion that most people would have read this book another Sherlock case, not a report, the case followed by unnecessary notes. These notes explained how Teddy Roosevelt's account was indicative of Watson's writings and how, with the use of quotations from the canon, the writings matches and this was proof of Sherlock's character and therefore his existence. It was these sections of the book that really ruined the pacing for me, the beginning felt forced and too coincidental, the notes ending was too long and inessential. Readers of Sherlock works have learnt to pull thoughts together themselves, they will easily notice the similarities in the texts without it being utterly spelled out to them. I found the jump from the end of the case story to the beginning of the notes to be much too sudden, their appeared to be no actually end to Sherlock's case which makes the reader feel a little.. Well. Put out. All in all, not a great novel, too much framing, not enough story. I intend to read another of this series to see if it is just this installment that falls down flat."}, {"userName": "Calvin Daniels", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27352647-calvin-daniels", "userReview": "Having Teddy Roosevelt as narrator was fresh and makes this a Holmesian winner."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6931943-jonathan", "userReview": "The further adventures of Sherlock Holmes paperbacks have often entertained, however, the quality does vary considerably, from the clever to the mundane and pedestrian. Unfortunately The Stalwart Companions does not quite fit into the clever category, nor is it poor quality, but it does have certain failings. It is not a badly written book, in terms of mimicking Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s style of writing it certainly delivers. It is also very much more grounded in the real world than most Sherlock Holmes parodies, which usually involve the famous detective battling supernatural creatures, or more often than not solving the Jack the Ripper murders. The premise of the former U. S. President Theodore Roosevelt effectively taking the mantle of Dr. Watson in this story is an intriguing idea. However, it does feel like a missed opportunity. The central mystery is solved far too easily, Holmes just seems to run around different places talking to people and everything falls into place, there is no real problem solving needed. The fact that the narrative repeatedly refers to the case as one of the most extraordinary Holmes has ever undertaken, only serve to highlight its deficiencies. It is not extraordinary and is in fact a good idea that was never fully explored."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151188-joe", "userReview": "An excellent student donated numerous copies of novels from the \"The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" series, a collection of books by different writers which pay homage to Arthur Conan Doyle and recast Holmes and Watson in different unlikely fin-de-siecle adventures: Sherlock Holmes meets Tarzan, Sherlock Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper, Sherlock Holmes and the War of the Worlds, etc.This adventure imagines a team up between a young twenty-something Sherlock Holmes and a young Teddy Roosevelt. Meeting in NYC during an acting junket, Holmes and Roosevelt collaborate to unravel an assassination plot of President Hayes. The work, obviously written with both great affection to TR and Arthur Conan Doyle, pays worthy tribute to the legacy of both men and is entirely worth reading."}, {"userName": "Phoebe", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12427030-phoebe", "userReview": "An interesting take on the pastiche and a clever and much-appreciated way to circumvent the usual \"it doesn't read like Watson/Doyle\" complaint. Can't complain here since this isn't Watson writing! Beyond that, The Stalwart Companions is a nice yarn with an interesting development, a fascinating alternate view of Sherlock Holmes and a genuine care for the Sherlockian world. While it certainly leaves a bit to be desired in terms of the frame narrative, the story it wants to tell is solid and well-presented, with a kind of 'air' and mystery that keeps you reading till the end. It makes no attempt to pretend to be bombastic or ostentatious, something much appreciated."}, {"userName": "Marie Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12249541-marie-danielle", "userReview": "I really liked this book. I liked how it was told from the perspective of Roosevelt instead of Sherlock Holmes. It was very different, interesting book to read. It was a great way for me to start my year of reading.
