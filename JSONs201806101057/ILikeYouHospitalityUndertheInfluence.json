This book is not funny. I mean, there are funny things in it, but it's not joke book or a send-up of Martha Stewart or anything like that. Instead it's pretty straightforward guide to entertaining (the having-your-friends-over kind of entertaining, mostly, with a just little making-a-spectacle-of-yourself-to-amuse-others kind of entertaining thrown in here and there). As a guide to throwing parties, this is a pretty good book. It does an excellent job of reiterating what the point and the spirit of entertaining is all about, i.e., having your friends come over as guests and showing them all a good time, and has some practical advice about how to do it. I had my Lucky '07 New Years party right after reading this book, and some of the points she made were helpful in planning and execution (I either forgot to read or Amy forgot to write the part about not drinking too much, but I suppose that's really neither here nor there).As a person who likes throwing theme parties, I can't imagine actually using most of the ideas in here, since I'd rather come up with them on my own. In general, a lot of these food and decoration ideas were brilliant, but it'd be kind of weird to execute them yourself because people would show up at your Kentucky Derby/Orgy party and say, \"Oh, you you made Amy Sedaris's Spanish Fly Mint Juleps (that's just a dumb example, I can't remember her actual party themes), I love the crocheted horses-humping-each-other coasters, just like the ones in the book, how cute\" or whatever, and that would probably be embarrassing and not impressive like having come up with the idea on your own.Ultimately, this book just made me want to become friends with Amy Sedaris, so she'd invite me to her amazing parties. Since this is unlikely to happen, this book left me feeling a little left-out and cranky, but I guess that has more to do with me (and my friends who do not love crafts, baking, and devising ways to amuse me and introduce me to the most handsome and witty conversationalists they know) than with Amy Sedaris."}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "Sarcastic, quirky and kooky, I Like You - this jokey book on being the hostess with the mostess - is perhaps the only kind of hospitality book I could take serious. Half of this is domestic, home-maker, party-planner, cookbook material. In fact it surprised me how much of I Like You is straight up serious. Some of it's funny as hell, but then you suddenly get a recipe thrown into the mix. It's as scatterbrained as its author's onscreen performances. Hit and miss.Amy Sedaris is generally a funny lady, but her brother David got the writer gene. She's more of a performer. That's fine if you listen to the audiobook, that way you at least get half of her talent. If this was a VIDEObook then you'd be in Amy Sedaris' wheelhouse!"}, {"userName": "mike", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/142036-mike", "userReview": "I stuck this book on my Christmas list. Nobody bit.I looked on Amazon. They used to say \"popular in Cincinnati, OH and Montgomery, AL\" -- no such information for this book. But something tells me I scared off my family with this one, with the cover being so garish and wacky. This is similar to the reaction I got when I asked for the Buffy musical episode for Christmas some years ago -- everyone just wanted to know, what the heck?Weeks passed before I remembered to start putting in library requests for the books I didn't get (luckily they didn't revoke my library privileges in the big city when I went expat). For this one I ended up something like 20th in the queue... for 45 copies citywide. That's simply unfathomable. I cleared the queue in a couple of weeks and lugged the book home (lugging large things on the train is becoming a recurring theme).Her book is well-written and funny... it has a fair number of drug references... and it has recipes that look like they just might work, but one is a little reluctant to commit a lot of time to recipes from someone who proclaims herself to have both a primary and a backup dealer.The bookstores really don't know where to file this -- some file it under Humor, some under Cooking, some just give up and stick it on a table in the middle of the store. During the book tour, Sedaris was at her most animated when railing against those who want to call it humor -- she takes the recipe and entertaining bit very seriously, in an ironic sort of way, and she wants people to take her book seriously. It's as if she truly believed she was the Betty Crocker for the new millennium, a burnt-out roach in the ashtray and a medicine cabinet full of Valium (and marbles).The library stuffed the book into Dewey classification 793, which maps to \"Indoor recreation and amusements.\" If it were ever on a library shelf -- and it will be a while before it makes it to a shelf anywhere, as the hold queue is just as deep as it was when I entered it -- it would be wedged between books called \"The Guest From Hell\" and \"Parties for Kids.\" A little to the left, wedding books; a little to the right, more books on kids' parties. So at the library, at least, Sedaris won the battle. She's in the party-throwing section.Do I dare try any of the recipes? I'm certainly steering clear of the crafts, because most of them rely on pantyhose, and even in SF, there are some things a guy just can't buy.[http://www.belle-aurore.com/mike/more...]"}, {"userName": "Nathan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/368200-nathan", "userReview": "Genius.

My love for Amy Sedaris goes back a long time. Before she was all cute on \u201cElf\u201d or doing guests spots on my new fave T.V. show \u201cBroad City\u201d \nI loved her as Jeri Blank. Totally inappropriate, menopausal, high school student, Jeri Blank.\nI wasn\u2019t prepared to not love this book. I had to take some time and come to terms with what I was feeling.\nI mean, Amy Sedaris is \nhilarious\n. Even without a series of her own or roles in movies, she\u2019s always being invited on the late night talk shows. And you know why???? Because she does things like make treats that look like cat shit when she\u2019s on Fallon:\nor allows Coco to bash her upside the head:\nFor a solid 15 years of me being a fan, Amy has always been so uproariously funny \u2013 never taking herself seriously. Unfortunately her book kind of does. There are intro pages to the various types of dining occasions and some pages of random anecdotes and various craft projects that bring the ha-ha, but for the most part this is just a bad cookbook. A REALLY bad cookbook (and trust me when I say I don\u2019t need any more help being a bad cook *ba-dum ching*). It was all just . . . \nSo it is with heavy heart I write this review. Amy \u2013 please know I still love you (and your brother David).

I hated the book much more. I felt that most of her tips were obvious, useless, not as funny as she was trying to be, and overall just dumb. The pictures, although I'm sure there was some creative and artistic brilliance involved in making it just so, were offensively UGLY, making even the recipes I had thought I might like to try look disgusting.

Also for the record, I was a good way into it when I realized that this book is NOT really geared towards heterosexual men such as myself (it was her giving advice on \"vaginal cleansing\" aka douching before I made this realization! Yeah, I know I'm slow.) I'm very familiar with (books by) Amy's brother, David Sedaris, and am a big fan. So I think I was hoping to find something just as funny and witty. Sadly this book is neither. To be sure, there are a few funny moments and quirky/interesting advice scattered here and there, but I found much of information useless. For instance, most of the recipes are meat-based. So being a vegetarian, they had no appeal at all for me. A few that are vegetarian are full of butter and cheese, and not very interesting. And frankly I don't a know a single health-care provider (and I know A LOT) who advocates douching (as it often causes chemical irritation to the vaginal mucosa and potentially increases risk of infection). Perhaps Amy Sedaris should be advising women to be more comfortable with their natural vaginal scent instead of trying to get them to smell like gardenias or whatever!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30544284-sarah", "userReview": "Amy Sedaris's mind is always at work.

Unfortunately, I had originally thought that when I invited people into my house I was saying, \"Hello, sorry my house looks like bohemian children with outrageous hobbies live here.\" But, whatever. Amy Sedaris, whom you might recognize from roles in School of Rock, Bewitched, Elf, and Strangers With Candy, has given us a slew of ideas, recipes, and helpful hints for entertaining those people we invite into our home. This over-sized tome is chock full of recipes, from the hors d'oeuvres to the main course to dessert. Mixed in, of course, are witty comments from Ms. Sedaris herself, hilarious photos, and tips on keeping that party spirit alive.

If you, like Amy, have a rich uncle unexpectedly drop in needing a place to stay for the weekend, remove your earrings and insert a broom straw in the ear hole. When your Rich Uncle asks why you have broom straws in your ear, tell him that you are saving up for a pair of earrings. After he goes to bed, make sure to heat up rocks to place on the pillow to keep his head warm while he sleeps. It costs money to entertain so always have a flea market table in your house.
