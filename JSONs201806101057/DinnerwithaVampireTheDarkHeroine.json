Just a few of these would be bad enough on their own even if written competently, but instead we have them mushed together nonsensically into a big mess where the basic principles of writing such as \u2018plot\u2019, \u2018continuity\u2019, \u2018character development\u2019 and \u2018worldbuilding\u2019 have been completly abandoned.It\u2019s a genuinely terrible book, and one I wouldn\u2019t recommend to anybody (and would advise people who have ever been raped or in an abusive relationship to steer well clear of) but somehow I couldn\u2019t bring myself to actively hate or abandon it. It\u2019s so bad that I had to keep going, just to see how much worse it could get (the answer: lots) but too bad for me to hate it. Rather than resent having to read such poor writing, I can\u2019t help but feel rather sorry for the teenage author (I know I certainly wouldn\u2019t like my unpolished teenage writings published). This is, essentially, a first draft of a book that should never have got past the publisher\u2019s slush pile and as such it feels very harsh to judge it even by the most basic standards of what I expect in a published work.The reason why it did get past, of course, is obvious: \u201917-year old Abigail from Brixham, Devon is already an online sensation, whose writing has attracted over 16 million views on Wattpad. None of her fans have yet to discover the breathtaking end to the novel and there is a huge anticipation to read the finale.\u2019 There, right on the back of the advance aeview copy is the only reason this is being published: to cash in on a huge ready-built online audience by forcing them to buy a copy if they want to read the ending. Shame on you HarperCollins, shame on you. This is, presumably, also why the book doesn\u2019t read like it\u2019s had a proofreader, much less a competent editor \u2013 it has to be rushed off the press before the fickle online audience move on and abandon it - and as a result continuity and worldbuilding issues abound.As an ARC I\u2019m meant to ignore basic spelling mistakes and typos that won\u2019t get past publication (\u2018would of\u2019 instead of \u2018would have\u2019 was one particularly frustrating example but there were many more) what I can\u2019t forgive the editor though is allowing some of the dreadful, confused, and often contradictory writing to slip through. In only the third chapter we have this gem \u2018The sun was beginning to rise, and I glanced at my watch\u2019 followed in the very next paragraph by \u2018it \u2026 was approaching sunrise\u2019 - yeah, we already got that thanks. Basic, basic mistakes. Later being able to feed without killing forms a major part of Violet\u2019s decision to turn into a vampire, except\u2026well she should already know that because it's obvious right from the begining. Elsewhere we have bizarre phrasing \u2013 \u2018her skin draped in her coat\u2019 does not sound like a description of a living person, much less an appealing description of one. Has she been flayed? No. Then surely what\u2019s meant is that the coat was draped over her skin. And that\u2019s far from an isolated incident, there are innumerable sentences and phrases that just sound wrong. The sort of basic \u2018wait a sec\u2026did you really mean to say this?\u2019 stuff that should be so so easy to pick up on and correct but have just been left to lie because, y\u2019know, 16 million readers already hooked, right? No need to bother spending time to make it a quality product! Again, shame on you HarperCollins, shame on you.Not, however, that this book could ever have been made into a truly good book. The phrases could have been tightened, the basic mistakes corrected, but this was always going to be a horrible book due to the poor plot and dreadful characters. Credit where credit is due, I suppose, the author tries to steer clear of the \u2018vampires are sexy but not remotely scary\u2019 trope that\u2019s slipped into vampire fiction recently. These vampires murder and rape without the slightest compunction, instead they\u2019ve been thoroughly \u2018defanged\u2019 by forcing them to act like the stupidest, most immature, and most petty sort of teenagers imaginable. When you have a man supposedly in his hundred\u2019s threatening his older sister that he\u2019ll tell daddy when she lost her virginity well\u2026it\u2019s hardly dark and sinister and it\u2019s certainly not \u2018charismatic and sexy\u2019.And the author tries to have it both ways. Kaspar is dark and sinister, but he\u2019s also a gentle little puppy waiting for the right woman to turn him into a noble prince. Those other vampires may be cruel and vicious, but he\u2019s just misguided! And what better way to emphasise it than by using rape as cheap drama. Now Kaspar may have threatened to rape Violet, he may have sexually harassed her several times, but when another vampire violently assaults her he\u2019ll come rushing to her rescue. What a hero! Oh wait, no. he still kidnapped, assaulted, harassed, and threatened to rape her. In fact, even after they have (surprisingly explicit) consensual sex, his pillow talk consists of telling her how he plans to rape the daughters of his enemies. No matter what \u2018nasty\u2019 vampires in this book you're meant to compare him with, Kaspar will still never be \u2018charismatic, sexy\u2018 or even likable. I can fall for \u2018evil is sexy\u2019 in my fiction, what I can\u2019t fall for is a character written to sound exactly like the sort of bloke who would rape you and then feel sorry for himself when you didn\u2019t like it. That sort of petty evil is sadly all too common in the real word, it doesn\u2019t need romanticising in fiction.And then the whole \u2018rape as a tool to push two characters together romantically\u2019\u2026 oooh boy do I hate that trope. I don\u2019t object to rape in fiction; it\u2019s a real thing, it happens, frequently, and it needs to be discussed openly and not made taboo. The test though is in how an author deals with the after affects. What rape in fiction should never be is simply an easy excuse to scare a female romantic lead away from all men but the \u2018hero\u2019. And guess how it\u2019s handled here? Yep, exactly that way. Before the rape; she hates Kaspar and sees through all his shit. After the rape; he rescued her and now they\u2019re best friends and she totally wants in his pants. It\u2019s handled so badly and so insensitively (despite a few \u2018I felt dirty, I shouldn\u2019t be acting this way\u2019 protests from Violet that never ring quite true with everything else shown on the page) that only a few pages, and a few days, after almost dying from the attack she doesn\u2019t mind at all when Kaspar sneaks into her room while she\u2019s asleep, covers her mouth to stop her screaming, and then practically demands she consents to having him suck her blood. Better still as soon as he leaves his best friend comes in (the other side of the love triangle) and forces a kiss on her which she\u2019s totally ok with. It\u2019s just\u2026it boggles the mind really.I could go on about the bad things in this book forever but what, I think, they mostly stem from is being originally published serially online. Even if I didn\u2019t know the origin of this book I\u2019m fairly sure I could guess it just from reading. It doesn\u2019t read like a book, it reads like someone\u2019s simply hit the print button on an online fiction and then bound the pages together. Instead of natural, flowing, plot and character development this book is just a string of things happening for no particular rhyme or reason. No time for proper world building or character development, got to keep the audience coming back, can\u2019t let up the pace! This might be tolerable when reading one chapter a month, maybe even one a week, but read it all in one go, as one reads a novel, and you realise that the tone and characterisation are just all over the place and that actually, no, it\u2019s not ok for these things to be happening so soon after each other.Then there\u2019s the bits that seem obviously inspired by feedback comments from fans \u2018oh you\u2019re so Kaspery! \u2013 It\u2019s a word I made up\u2019, \u2018I can\u2019t die! I\u2019ve never been to Disneyland!\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s pronounced Sage-en, not Sagean\u2019 (this last one is particularly dumb because the character had only ever heard the word so, not knowing how it's spelt, would have no reason to be pronouncing it with an \u2018a\u2019 in the first place).Add to this the fact that the plot doesn\u2019t even make sense \u2013 the easiest and least dangerous thing to do would just be to give Violet back to her family, bind her to an agreement of secrecy and let her go on her way. That and there is no way Violet could possibly \u2018know\u2019 the big secret she guesses blindly, and even less way that the vampires shouldn't already have considered it - but guess what? Her wild guess is totally correct and the vampires are stunned! Then there\u2019s the sudden shift in genre near the end of the book as well; it\u2019s all \u2018clich\u00e9d vampire romance\u2019 yawn yawn yawn. But then WHAM! \u2018Actually there are several alternate universes and Violet is the heroine who has to save them all!\u2019. Except instead of \u2018wham\u2019 it\u2019s more of an \u2018oh shit, I forgot to do my worldbuilding earlier or set up this plot thread properly but this is totally what this book is actually about\u2019.And then Violet... Why should I care for this character? I can feel sorry for her situation, but the character herself is not written to be sympathetic in any way. She\u2019s lost her brother and that\u2019s meant to be a big plot point explaining how she ended up where she did; except he barely gets referenced three times and it\u2019s always \u2018it was really sad when he died, it affected me a lot\u2019 without ever actually seeing it affect her. Her ex-boyfriend cheated on her but that again gets about three references. Her little sister has cancer, but she\u2019s too busy drooling over Kaspar to think of her family more than about twice and then acts like a total bitch to them at the end. She slut shames all of the previous girls Kaspar has ever slept with, deciding they must be \u2018whores\u2018 (as far as I can tell none of them are sex workers and Charity, the girl particularly demonised by Violet, Kaspar and the autor, actually did fancy and want a relationship with Kaspar, it was him using her purely for sex). She pretty much slut shames her best friend (never mentioned again) in the first chapter, does the same to Kaspar\u2019s sister, and even thinks of Kaspar\u2019s exes \u2018whores\u2019 as she is shagging him. Why should I like her? She\u2019s a judgemental bitch and her Stockholm syndrome isn\u2019t written in anything like a believable enough way to prevent her from just looking like a complete idiot.

This was because she was first discovered on Wattpad, which is kinda like Fanfiction.net but for original fiction and has some fribbling social networking thing about it as well. On this site, she racked up thousands and thousands of viewers for the tale... then HarperCollins signed her up before the volume was finished and so all her followers had to go and buy it to see how it ended.This little tale doesn't exactly inspire confidence that it's any good, now, does it?Well, I therefore considered it a prime candidate for snarking at. And I'm glad I did. Because this novel bites. (Drum fill.)Executive SummaryMore reasons why fanfic-addled teenagers should not be allowed to write novels.A bit more detail, if you wouldn't mind, hm?Our heroine here is one Violet Lee, who is posh, seventeen, and the daughter of the Minister for Defence. She's out in London in Trafalgar Square late one night and she espies a sextet of vampires polishing off some other guys, nomming down on their blood, and dumping their body. But before she can raise the alarm, she's snatched off the street, chloroformed, and taken to the vampires super secret base, where she meets a bunch of other vampires. Naturally, they're all gorgeous fellas with their shirts hanging open and/or preternaturally gorgeous and perfect women.Is it just me, or should this novel's title be changed to \"Planet of the Mary Sues,\" n'est-ce pas?Anyhow. Once she's been explained the situation and how the vampires are all perfectly normal and harmless and approximately as dangerous as a souffl\u00e9 (they do eat people, yes, but only out of necessity, and they're predators, not murderers), she finds herself inducted into their underground society, in which they plot, plan, have extravagant masqued balls (to which she is invited), and generally being lusted after by bishie male vampires. Then, shock horror! One of the vampires tries to rape her, partially succeeds, and she has to be turned, well, half-turned, into a dhampir at least. Oh no! This is drastic! Now you probably reckon we're gonna get some brilliant personal horror and densely written, introspective character studying into he who fights with monsters, and so forth, now, don't you. Well... nope. Because that would be original and good, and this is neither. In case you haven't already noticed, it's The Vampire Lestat meets Mills & Boon on a bed of Twilight, and there seems to be bits lifted from classic World of Darkness as well, what with the vampires having kingdoms and princedoms and all plotting against each other, except without the fact that the vampires in cWOD are genuinely creepy and dangerous and can do unpleasant things to you for shiggles, and that one day the stars will align and their colossally powerful predecessors will come forth from beneath the earth and suchlike.What actually happens is she falls in love with one of them, specifically, Kaspar, who is the other viewpoint character. He manages to be even creepier than Edward Cullen. He was one of the folks who kidnapped her, and held her hostage in a super secret vampire base God knows where, and threatened to slay her entire family if she tried to escape, and this is because, he claims, he loves her?!I've thought of another new title for this book now: \"Stockholm Syndrome: The Novel.\"Anyhow. On to the writing. It sucks. In an attempt to cockwave about how erudite and sophisticate Ms Gibbs is, she opens it with a quote from William Blake. Unfortunately, and like many, nay, almost all, teenage writers, she cannot write a believable character. In fact, I am the venerable age of 27 and I am only just starting to be able to generate characters that are believable. This is because to make your characters act like people can believe they ought, you have to have life experiences. You have to get to know the reasons for which people act as they do. At 18, your experience of human interaction will be of necessity limited. I know mine was. My frame of reference when I was 18 was me, my mates Alexander, Craig, Spunky B (whose real name was Ben) and Lumpy Dave (whose real name was Adam - don't ask) who all played endless rounds of Magic the Gathering at lunchtimes, slaughtered each other at Unreal Tournament and Command & Conquer after school, and lied about how much crumpet we were slingin' our peckersnot up at the weekends. Hence, when I tried to write as a teenager, all my characters were, well, STANDARD NERDS! Even when at university, I still had limited frames of reference and experience on which to base believable characters because then it was STANDARD NERDS and university students. So my characters swung from caricature to caricature. So, the vampires of The Dark Heroine act like catty, spoilt teenagers towards each other and Violet. In fact, it might as well be set in a girls school in the south of England, such do they all come over as.And this is the first of many problems with The Dark Heroine. Abigail Gibbs wrote most of this as a teenaged Twilight fangirl and, especially on a site like Wattpad, her entire audience was probably Twihards as well. She therefore had nobody to tell her, lassie, take note, people do not act like this. For instance, why would you say that Violet, our protagonist, is \"feisty\" yet have her do absolutely nothing but bellyache about how she's a hostage (albeit a hostage of scrummy vampire men). The plot is also bereft of sense. Why would an immortal, ageless, undead being have any meeting of minds or fancy for a teenager who he doesn't know, especially when there's thousands of tasty vampire women for him to bone, all of whom probably bang like a shit house door when the plague's in town. And why would he not immediately turn loose someone whose family was important as hers was, especially considering that the whole vampire secrecy thing is enforced by secret treaties with human governments, and pay her off to forget about it? Sense is not made by this, and let's be honest. Who's gonna believe a spoilt Robert Pattinson-addled teenager who claims that there's a secret cabal of vampires in London and they're out to have a big fuck-off war with each other? They're just gonna tell her that her Vampire: The Masquerade LARPing group isn't real and ignore her.Then there's the whole excusing-an-abusive-manchild-and-kidnapper because he's hawt, which I've foamed about in previous writeups.Then there's the fact that in just 334 pages, there's 61 chapters. The chapters are therefore short and stumpy. Yet while this can be used to make your novel all fast paced, it's really not a good idea when your protagonist spends her days moping about being captured and things go on around her. It breaks up the narrative flow, especially as the chapters keep changing just as you're getting into something. If ever the book has ADHD. No doubt this is caused by the fact that the novel originated on social networking, and we all know what that does to one's attention span.Then there's the fact that the writing style is bland as a very bland thing. I don't think there are any actual sex scenes (I kinda skimmed the last half of the novel because it was completely failing to engage any interest) but if there are, I bet you anything they're of the \"insert tab A into slot B\" variety.Finally, I should mention that in the acknowledgements she refers to her 16 million readers on Wattpad as \"kaspary.\" Pass the sickbags.So that's about it really. If you were thinking that surely 16 million internet users can't be wrong, well... yes, yes they can, and here is the evidence. It's a lazily written sub-Twilight knockoff, flatly written, with no originality, and no believability. That the author netted a six-book deal with it boggles the mind, because I'd rather have teeth pulled than read this again.And just in case Abigail Gibbs is reading this (which I suspect she will eventually, as I'm gonna cross-post all my reviews of books on here onto Amazon), then yes, I could do better, and one day, should I feel the need to, I will. However I'm still stuck at 39,000 words in \"Hazelnut's Completely Indomitable Law Procedural\" right now, so expect \"Hazelnut's Utterly Bodacious Vampire Novel\" much later.In the meantime, I'm off to read some Sheridan Le Fanu.(originally written for Everything2.com.)"}, {"userName": "Fathima", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5799807-fathima", "userReview": "Soooo , up until the end I was all like ,  Omg !!!

La primera edici\u00f3n se public\u00f3 cuando Abigail Gibbs, su autora, contaba con tan solo 18 a\u00f1os y comenz\u00f3 gestarse incluso tres a\u00f1os antes, en la plataforma wattpad. Realmente no deja de asombrarme el talento de alguien tan joven, al crear un libro de este calibre, que te mantiene pendiente de sus p\u00e1ginas, a la espera de lo que suceder\u00e1 en el pr\u00f3ximo cap\u00edtulo.Que nunca amanezca es una historia de vampiros en que, por supuesto, hay una historia de amor en que se ve involucrada una joven humana. Hasta ah\u00ed, cualquiera podr\u00eda pensar que es una m\u00e1s entre tantas. Pero nada m\u00e1s lejos. Abigail desarrolla un universo muy original para su novela, en que incluye varias dimensiones, profec\u00edas e, incluso, algunos componentes pol\u00edticos, ya que su planteamiento es que los representantes de los gobiernos conocen la existencia de los vampiros y all\u00ed se mantiene un precario equilibrio entre juegos de poder.Por otra parte, la caracterizaci\u00f3n de sus vampiros es de lo m\u00e1s tradicional respecto de su naturaleza oscura; si bien son seres con un alto concepto del honor, no reniegan de su naturaleza depredadora (la mayor\u00eda son vampiros de nacimiento y no porque fueran convertidos). Las descripciones del entorno vamp\u00edrico est\u00e1n muy bien logradas.La historia de Kaspar y Violet se cuece a fuego muy lento y, a pesar de lo extenso del libro, no sobran p\u00e1ginas ya que todo lo que ocurre nos conduce y prepara para el desenlace. Tambi\u00e9n me llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n que no hay medias tintas al abordar la relaci\u00f3n y los encuentros \u00edntimos de la pareja.Si bien el libro tiene algunos fallos, principalmente relacionados con la caracterizaci\u00f3n de algunos personajes o en la continuidad que da a algunas l\u00edneas argumentales que abre y no cierra adecuadamente, tampoco es algo que moleste tanto y lo m\u00e1s seguro es que la autora pula su estilo en futuras obras, de las cuales estar\u00e9 muy pendiente."}, {"userName": "Nicki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8593868-nicki", "userReview": "This book is dreadful. It was written by a 15-year-old girl and it shows. Everybody in it behaves like a stroppy teenager, even the centuries old vampires, who should know better. It's all breathless teenage romance, darting from \"God, I hate him!\" to \"God, I love him\" and back again throughout the entire book. The heroine, Violet, is bland and boring, and a complete Mary Sue to boot. Kaspar, the vampire prince love interest, is thoroughly unpleasant. He's arrogant without being charismatic. He's apparently gorgeous, but entirely unattractive. He also oscillates between \"God, I hate her!\" and \"God, I love her!\". None of the characters in this book ever develop. They start off two-dimensional and remain that way. The readers are simply expected to accept plot points and vague explanations about why these two are destined to be together. Violet's abrupt change of heart about vampires is waved away as Stockholm Syndrome. She fails to take her chance to escape captivity because she doesn't want to see her ex-boyfriend. It's all pretty laughable really. The writing is atrocious, overblown and painfully laboured. There are spelling and grammar mistakes throughout. The editors and publishers should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves for this. The chapters are mainly told from Violet's perspective, but sometimes jump to Kaspar's point of view. This doesn't work at all. Neither do Violet's dreams, when the reader is suddenly thrown to a different narrator, with no warning. Throughout the novel, Kaspar calls Violet \"Girly\", which the author seems to want us to take as a term of endearment, but is actually irritatingly patronising. Which brings me to something else that really bothered me. Many of the characters repeatedly refer to Violet as a bitch, a slut or a whore. These are words that are only ever used for a female character. Kaspar, who is undoubtedly much more promiscuous than Violet, isn't referred to like this. I found it quite disturbing that a young female writer felt the need to resort to using sexist slurs like this so often.There are so many things wrong with this book, I'm amazed that it got published. Apparently, it was a internet hit, so it smacks greatly of a publisher trying to cash in after the Fifty Shades of Grey phenomenon.

How tragic.\u201d \n\nKaspar is the perfect example of the bad vampire lost in his inhumanity, resigned later on to a fate that has other plans for him, but is ultimately found in his darkness by the person he chose to treat with indifference and contempt. Little did he know.:)\n\n\u201cHe sighed, his hands tangling themselves in my already-knotted hair. \u201cViolet, don\u2019t ever leave me. Whatever happens; however things get, just don\u2019t go. Please.\u201d \n\nAnd finally the action. No. THE ACTION. That was really something to behold. You freakin never get bored! The mix of political games, deception, evil plots, fate and romance, all destined to make your head spin till you turn page after page, gulping down the amazingness of this story.*sigh*:D"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin", "userReview": "3.5 sexy and fun stars! I hauled this out of the bargain bin at a boxing day sale, so really it didn't owe me a lot. However, I was promised the sexiest read of the year and well it did gain some points there. The story..Violet Lee is just an ordinary 17 year old British girl hanging out in Trafalgar square until she witnesses six vampires annihilate 30 men. She is kidnapped and brought to the royal house. Violet is pretty pissed that she is now with a bunch of murderers and does what she can to drive the royal family crazy especially heir to the throne, Kaspar. Kaspar is a an absolute asshole and treats Violet like crap and of course this means that the two are totally going to hook up. Of course, Violet also has to deal with her father, secretary of defense minister being a little more involved in the vampire world than she thinks AND that she just might be the key to an ancient prophecy. My thoughts...I see all the one stars and I totally get where everyone is coming from, except that I do find the writing is good(not great, but good) and the plot had a lot of potential. There are some great secondary characters in this- Fabian, Layla, Cain, the King etc. Sure, I would like to sit young Violet down and explain why Kaspar is not the fellow on which a gal should build her future on,BUT despite that I couldn't stop reading and I freaking loved it. Cotton candy for my brain!"}, {"userName": "Naoms", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2152441-naoms", "userReview": "Originally Posted on: Confessions of an Opinionated Book Geek\"I have to be completely honest. I didn\u2019t finish this book and I honestly don\u2019t believe I can. I just can\u2019t. I have finished some not so great books in my life. I finished \u201cFifty Shades Freed,\u201d \u201cBeautiful Bastard\u201d and \u201cEve,\u201d just to see how they would end, but I just cannot continue. More than not being my style of book, it is just horrible.The first thing I noticed about this book is that the writing isn\u2019t very good. Ok, I will admit that most YA paranormal books are not Pulitzer winning, but this was immediately difficult for me to stomach. The dialogue is stilted, dry and just plain cheesy. The author tries to make Kasper into this dangerously powerful guy, but he just talks too much. Before I was fifty pages in, he\u2019d alluded to his royal status, made false clich\u00e9 vamp threats and used an abusive amount of force against Violet many, many times. Due to his nonstop bragging, I could not take him seriously. Powerful men don\u2019t have to yell \u201cI AM POWERFUL.\u201d A good writer should be able to show us power without the characters telling us.I read books like this and realize they are the reason why I am forced to abide stares and mockery when I admit to reading PNR, fantasy and YA. This book is receiving a lot of hype. The author is a teenager who was given a substantial book deal. The news will get out about this book. Just like with \u201cTwilight,\u201d people not familiar with the genre will pick this book up and assume this is what all the books are like. And once again the genre will get a bad rap.Violet, similar to Kasper, talks too much. She is arrogant, sarcastic and cannot shut up to save her life. The opening sequence consists of a bloody battle, a revelation of a new species and a kidnapping. Through it all Violet snaps at these violent beings, complains, throws out accusations and declares that she cannot run any longer, because she is dying. Yup, on many obituaries you read that a person died due to running too long. I am sure that the author made Violet outspoken to show that she is strong, etc, but I found her to be annoying and unrealistic. A realistic teenage girl would be in shock at all the carnage, she would be terrified, she would be stunned and then traumatized. A normal teenage girl would then find the will to survive and find a way to get out of there alive or at the very least try her best not to be noticed or gain the wrath of her kidnappers. Violet just runs around calling people mad men, ignoring rules and all around missing the incredibly dangerous situation she finds herself in.Besides the not so great writing, I just cannot abide this romance. I can\u2019t. There is a scene where Violet is coming through from being unconscious. We see this from Kasper\u2019s point of view, so we know that he knows she is regaining consciousness and he slaps her really hard! This is not a healthy love story. Violet obviously is suffering from Stockholm syndrome and I think that this abusive male love interest is getting really, really old. Especially in YA! Come on Young Adult authors, write teenage girls love interests that are worthy of them, that are respectful and kind! This guy Kaspar is one of the worst love interests I have ever read. Just a horrible person.I feel bad. I know this is a young writer and it\u2019s great that the next generation is writing, etc, but honestly, why did the publishers not make her revise, revise and revise! Why does it feel like a first draft? Why wasn\u2019t it fine-tuned and adjusted? I just can\u2019t believe how awful this was."}, {"userName": "Eleni Ouzouni", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24520173-eleni-ouzouni", "userReview":

There was a lot of hype surrounding the author, who is just eighteen and landed a six figure publishing deal. It is definitely a different take on vampire lore, but it wasn't enough to keep me interested. When I was 75% done with the book I actually thought about putting it away, but I figured I had come this far...What bothered me the most about this book was her writing style and lack of character development. It didn't flow at all; each time I picked up the book it took me a long time to get into it. Her characters were weak and a lot of them just felt superfluous.

My reason for this was that my first instinct was to write a purely negative review, but this seemed unfair so I chose a title that would force me to focus on the good parts as well as the bad. And so, on to the good. The author wrote this when she was a teenager, surely a feat worthy of commendation. It is not every teenager that can demonstrate the dedication to write an entire novel nor the ability to create a plot and characters, and for this, Gibbs deserves credit. I am sure there are many who will enjoy the novel, especially in the wake of the 'Twilight' phenomenon; it has many of the elements that people enjoy - the dangerous yet handsome and alluring vampires, the innocent girl who ends up drawn into the vampires' world, love, lust, sex, the supernatural and so forth. It is also quite believable insofar as the vampires are not all 'nice guys' - the author does not shy away from the fact that they are blood-drinkers and therefore, harm and kill humans whom they view as food. This attempt at showing the bloodthirsty nature and killer instinct of vampires is refreshing in its honesty. For all these reasons, I am certain that many will find much to like about this novel, especially teenagers. However, I am not one of them, which brings me on to the bad. This has to be the weak and unengaging plot. The book reads like a cross between 'Twilight' and '50 Shades of Grey' with a bit of Mills and Book thrown in. We have our 'Twilight' vampires (all dark, brooding and handsome of course) with our obligatory love triangle (Fabian instead of Jacob) and a hero who plays an instrument (guitar instead of piano), our random sex scenes (not as graphic as '50 Shades' but nonetheless an attempt at titivating the reader) and our constantly changing Mills and Boon-ish 'she hates him, she loves him, he hates her, he loves her' scattered throughout the novel. We also have a mirroring of what was probably the most annoying aspect of '50 Shades' - the inner voice; both protagonist and her love interest seem to have this inner voice and engage in conversations with their inner voice frequently. To her credit the author supplies an explanation for the existence of this inner voice, but the explanation was unbelievable (and I do realise the irony of considering anything believable when talking about a vampire book, but for the purposes of a review, this is not the place to discuss the credibility of vampires) and made it even worse. What we don't have is any realistic description of why our protagonist would like her vampire - she hates him and everything he stands for including his lust for blood, she frequently fears him, he has threatened to kill the family she loves dearly in horrific ways....and yet she loves him...apparently. It seems a rather strange basis for love in my opinion. I certainly could see nothing to like, love, or even vaguely be attracted to in Kasper, our lead vampire, and I found it implausible that Violet (our protagonist) would either. Even more implausible was Kasper's love for her; Kasper is apparently hundreds of years old, with all the wisdom and life experience that these years would have given him, and yet he finds a meeting of minds with a teenager? The word 'tenuous' springs to mind. Then again, perhaps Kasper is sufficiently immature to relate to his teenage love interest; certainly his dialogue seems to show rather childlike ways as shown by this gripping exchange between Violet and Kasper (page 186):Violet: They do.Kasper: Don't.Violet: Do.Kasper: Don't!Furthermore, the vampires too often seem like charicatures rather than genuine beings - they 'snarl' or 'spit out' almost everything they say - and I particularly laughed at the description of Charity (yes, that really is the name of one of the vampires). Charity is one of the 'lady' vampires in the novels and she is portrayed as having rather loose morals; she completely lives up to her 'chav-like' chariciture when she has an argument with Kasper - 'she shrieked in frustration, tearing at her hair extensions.' At least the novel offers the odd bit of humour I suppose!And finally on to the ugly...the grammar mistakes in this novel are apalling and so frequent that if I had not have (yes, 'have' not 'of' - more on that later in the review) been sent this as a review book and thus felt obliged to complete it, I would not have done so. I admit freely that I am rather pedantic about grammar, probably more so than I should be in this day and age, but these grammatical mistakes are the sort that no author, especially one apparently studying English at Oxford University should ever make. Here are just a few little gems for you:- 'you would of gone home' (instead of 'you would have gone home') Page 306 - 7.- 'what her and Fabian were up to' (instead of 'what she and Fabian were up to') Page 420.- 'people sat around me' (instead of 'the people who were sitting around me'. Page 420. - 'me and Kasper were' (instead of 'Kasper and I were'). Page 437.- 'how could she have sat down and wrote' (should be 'written'). Page 453- 'servants words' (should be 'servant's words'). Page 480There are many more but I grew tired of writing them down. The problem is that these are not innocous mistakes, or maybe the breaking of a few antiquated grammar rules - these are illustrations of very poor Englih grammar and not what one would expect from a novelist or from her publishers, who surely should have provided her with a decent proof-reader? For all the above reasons, while I am sure Abigail Gibbs will have a legion of teenage fans, I will not be looking out for any of her novels nor will I be recommending any of them to my acquaintances."}, {"userName": "kirstin \u273f", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5045321-kirstin", "userReview": "[Violet's birth and Kaspar's voice.

Erm how can I say this? You see how Twilight is internationally known as being the lowest form of literature there can be right now, along with 50 shades? This book was worse than Twilight. Yes, you read right. Twilight actually had LIKEABLE characters. Alice was quite enticing, was she not? This book contained no Alices, no Edmees, no character to make this terrible reading journey more readable. They were basically all annoying jerks.The big Love Interest, Kaspar, is a potential rapist and reaaaaaally scary. Everytime he touched the heroine, I wanted to recoil and her to call the police, kick him in the balls, anything. He kept forcing himself on her until she finally decided, god knows why, that the attraction was mutual and that she accepted his coming onto her. But honestly, this made me extremely uncomfortable as he did not exactly wait for her permission to bite her, touch her in inappropriate way, threatens to RAPE HER and yet he is supposed to be the swoon-worthy love interest.. Wtf?The other love interest, well, just another vampire that expressed interest towards the MC, Violet (because her eyes are purple, geddit? HAHA OH THE FUN YOU'LL HAVE READING THIS.), at first he was nice and kind and I thought : \"why does she have to end up with Kaspar instead of with Fabian? He's perfect\". Well, everything changed when she refused his love, he transformed into an abusive asshole. I also loved how the next day after Violet gets almost raped, he asks her to be with him. WHAT PERFECT TIMING. And note that Kaspar also starts touching her something like 2 days after and it's noooooooooooo problem at all. The main character, Violet, is a textbook Mary-Sue. She's beautiful and she has VIOLET EYES. HOW SPESHUL. And of course, in the first chapters, Kaspar teases her about her eye colour and she complains in her head with something among the lines of \"No, not the mockery like at school\". Ooooooooof course. If a pretty girl has violet eyes, she's going to get bullied because of them. I can see that happening LOL She has all the drama, she is a CHOSEN ONE and everyone falls in love with her : Kaspar, Fabian, the asshole who tried to rape her... And can I add that I'm sick and tired of the \"rape trope\" to make your heroines more desirable and arrange some nice comfort scenes with the love interest, YA-authors? Rape. is not. an acceptable trope. It leaves people broken and it certainly wasn't portrayed in this story (yes I am aware that the rape did not actually happen, but what happened to her was still extremely traumatizing.). She supposedly doesn't have any flaw besides being endearingly stubborn and Kaspar calls her many times \"feisty\" fondly. Can I just express my deep hatred for that condescending word? It's as if he said \"I love how you try to fight me, a real turn-on but now let's go to my flat, m'kay luv?\". NOT. A. COMPLIMENT. And her reactions were completely inappropriate, at moments : she sees Kaspar murder 30 people so she mutters \"jerk\". REALLY? THAT'S IT, VIOLET?Also all the other female characters were either ugly (Autumn), mean (Lyla, who went from nice doctoring girl to rageing bitch without no one knowing why and no apologies?!), old (the vampire ladies) or dead. Seriously. The book itself was unnecessary long, the plot stupid and the sex scene god-awful. I spent a nice time snorting to myself. In spite of this being published, I noticed a few grammar mistakes that annoyed me.Honestly this book does NOT deserve its publication. I would read it as passable fanfiction at best and I can't believe the publisher's nerve to make this rubbish into a trilogy."}, {"userName": "Barbara Elsborg", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050186-barbara-elsborg", "userReview": "I bought this book for a number of reasons - liked the cover (call me shallow), liked the blurb, liked the little round sticker thing telling me it was a sexy romance. Sadly, that was more or less all I liked about it. It was YA. WHY didn't it say that on the book? I wouldn't have bought it. I don't want to read a romance involving a 17 year old. I've seen comments that say this is something that will appeal to older readers but it didn't appeal to me.The plot had so many holes it was laughable at times. The spelling and grammar mistakes made me cringe. Where was the editing? The author is attending a top British university and the mistakes are bad ones. Draw and drawer muddled. Missing apostrophes etcThe dialogue tags are ones all professional writers are told to avoid. The repeats of words like smirked - are annoying.The characters are even more annoying. Why would she want Kaspar? He's horrible.Why would he want her? She's insufferable. She had the voice of an arrogant teenager floucing all over the place. He didn't sound like a century old vampire.I could go on and on, I won't.I did think some of the descriptions were well done. The ball, the dancing, the way she was passed from vamp to vamp was well written and chilling. I know the author was very young when she started this and I commend her for actually writing a novel but she has to be judged on adult terms when a big publisher puts her on the shelves. I'll be writing to complain to them that they mislead with not stating this book is YA - or at least telling the potential reader the heroine is 17 in the blurb.So I don't feel I'm the target audience and in that respect the review will seem harsh.

I had heard this was originally written on Wattpad when the author was 15 and was later picked up by a major publishing house in a six figure deal. That is enough to stir anyone's curiosity. Unfortunately, curiosity can also get you in trouble and that was the case for me.First off this isn\u2019t going to be a nice review. I had so many problems with this book that is was impossible for me to enjoy. To illustrate my point I am going to do something a little different for this review, I am going to review it using my Goodreads status updates so that you can see exactly what I was feeling as I progressed through this novel.1. Page 1 \"There are so many mixed reviews about this book I'm both nervous and excited to read it. I will keep my expectations low so I can either be pleasantly surprised or not disappointed.\"See look! I started this book off with some apprehension but was going to keep my expectations low so that I didn\u2019t get hurt.2. P 61 \"Is this book YA or NA? Its ok so far, a little wordy but I'm intrigued.\"I found out as I continued reading that I would probably class this book as New Adult because the protagonist is 18 and there is sexual content. Also the wordiness NEVER STOPS. It was like the publisher just took exactly what was on Wattpad and never edited it. The purpose of editing is to take out the parts that aren\u2019t needed or do not advance the story, unfortunately that never happens in this book and instead we are left with a wordy, disjointed and lengthy novel.3. P.331 \"Well this is taking a turn for the weird/disturbing. I actually think I hate all of the charterers in this book. No one has a redeeming quality. And now the girl with Stockholm syndrome is sleeping with the kidnapper who is a complete jackass, great.\"This is the heart of why I hated this book. None of the characters were likable. None of them had a redeeming quality. The heroine, Violet Lee, witnesses a vampire murder and then to keep her silent the vampires take her back to their mansion. While at the mansion she falls for Kaspar (Stockholm Syndrome much?). Kaspar treats women, vampire and human alike terribly and then for some reason these two absolutely terribly people fall for eachother. I think at one point there is also an edict from Kaspar\u2019s father that they can\u2019t touch. I mean things just got SO ridiculous and disjointed the story became painful to read. I also want to mention that this book has the honor of having the least sexy sex scene that I have ever read. There was no passion, no emotion it was completely blas\u00e9 and sort of grossed me out to be honest. With this scene you could really tell that someone young and inexperienced was writing it. 4. P.381 \"I'm debating whether to stop reading this but I feel like I've already made it this far...also random aside this whole Dark Heroine business feels like a completely different story that was just tacked on to the one I began. No foreshadowing or linking things up so they flow.\"Randomly during the last quarter of the book Gibbs stops focusing on the relationship/problems between Kaspar, Violet, and Kaspar\u2019s family and begins focusing on a Dark Heroine prophesy. It came completely out of left field and didn\u2019t link up to the story at all! If the story had focused on the Dark Heroine from the beginning it actually might have been an interesting story. Overall, I did eventually finish the story but it took months and it was the worst book I have read in recent memory. The story had good potential but was poorly executed and even more poorly edited. I think Gibbs has potential as an author with a little polish and a serious editor. Hopefully her next novel someone takes all this potential and turns it in to something worthwhile."}, {"userName": "All Things Urban Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732683-all-things-urban-fantasy", "userReview": "I should have known better. THE DARK HEROINE began as Twilight fan fiction in the mind of then fifteen year old Abigail Gibbs. Three years later, hot on the heels of another Twilight-fan-fiction-turned-huge-best-seller, Harper Voyager is publishing this sloppy, poorly written, and often upsetting mess.Violet witnesses a vampire attack, and the vampires decide to abduct the witness and keep her at their family estate until she dies or agrees to turn. The Cullens they are not. They intimidate, threaten, and assault Violet regularly. Kasper is basically a sexual predator with fangs. He tells Violet that he will have sex with her eventually whether she wants to or not. He has has loud, wall shaking sex every night in the room next to her. At one point he even breaks down her door and attacks her when she thwarts his \u201cdate\u201d plans one night, pins her to the bed\u2013in front of his \u2018date\u2019\u2013and threatens to \u2018use her instead\u2019:In a blur he launched himself across the room. He collided with my side to take me with him, and I was sent rolling across the bed, coming to a halt when my head hit the bedside cabinet. I let out a scream as he landed on top of me, pinning me to the bed. I winced through gritted teeth as the corner of the cabinet dug into my spine.\u201cGet off me, you horny git!\u201d I screeched, kicking and flailing, revolted at his closeness.\u201cWhy, am I making you uncomfortable? Maybe I will use you instead!\u201d he snarled, a tormenting smirk twisting his face. His eyes were devoid of any emotion\u2014he meant it. Straddling me with one leg either side of my stomach, he forced me deeper into the mattress, pinning my hands above my head. He began to pull my shirt up, and I heard squeals of protest from Charity, which merged with the protests of the mattress as I tried to fight free.The breaking point for me comes when Violet is brutally attacked, and sexually assaulted by another vicious and psychotic vampire. He says and does truly abhorrent things to her including detailing his plan for necrophilia. A scant second before he rapes her, she is rescued by Kasper. Days later, they have their first sexual encounter when Kasper attacks her in her sleep:He snarled, hastily clamping a hand down over my mouth. I attempted to bite at his fingers but found myself quickly subdued.\u201cPlay nicely now,\u201d he mocked, pressing himself closer. I caught sight of the deranged, lustful glint in his blood-red eyes. My eyes widened and I was hushed to silence, terrified.\u201cCome on, Girly, just a little drop of blood. I\u2019m so hungry. You\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201dI scowled and thrashed about as he lay draped across me, pressing his crotch hard into my stomach.It just got worse from there and I gave up."}, {"userName": "Ashneet", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15506821-ashneet", "userReview": "I absolutely adored this novel. I thought that the two protagonists were great. This novel is written in the POV of Violet Lee, which is our female protagonist and Kasper Varn who is our male protagonist. However there are considerably more chapters from Violets POV.Violet is a headstrong, kick ass and all in all an awesome character. But their were moments where I was screaming at her. Kasper Varn however is just SEXY! that's all I have to say on him. He is just amazing!I won't go into the plot as you guys can just read the description but I can say that I was not satisfied with the end. The ending left me with a lot of questions that I wanted the answers to. However now that I know that their will be a sequel titled 'Autumn Rose', I hope those questions are finally answered. Overall I recommend you read this book as its entertaining and can be pretty funny at times. Also it's set in England which I thought was a good change as most YA novels are set in America. Even though this novel is about vampires and there are a million other vampire novels out already, I found this to be quite a unique take on them. All in all I think if you enjoy reading about vampires then I think you will like this novel. Also don't be intimidated by the size. I finished this novel in two days. It's an easy read so you will just fly right through it."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40810725-sara", "userReview": "Ensinn\u00e4kin, todella arvostan kirjailijaa joka on niin nuorena l\u00e4htenyt toteuttamaan unelmaansa.

me from page one and kept me right until the end.Whilst on a night out Violet is witness to a horrific slaughter of a group of men. As the witness Violet is kidnapped by the murderers and taken to a lavish estate. On arrival Violet learns these men are not ordinary they are vampires. *squeal* It turns out this isn't as simple as it first seems. Violet is the daughter of a powerful man and there are more complications than anyone had hoped as everyone is thrown in to a whirlwind of vampire-human politics. Violet is a beautiful character, she has spunk and courage where others would have given up. She portrays herself as tough but she is troubled and vulnerable. She hates the situation she has been thrown into and hates the vampires even more. As time progresses she finds herself making friends with several vampires but still loathes Kasper who was the one who decided to kidnap her rather than kill her.Kasper is harsh and often cruel to Violet but he soon realises that isn't working. He is ultimately trying to get her to turn into a vampire and forcing her isn't going to work. No matter how hard either of them try they are drawn to each other. Kasper is exciting and dangerous but he has a really sweet side. The side that every girl wants in a guy. He is protective and attentive to her needs and Violet soon finds herself falling for him.It's hard to find the words to express how much I loved this book. I was really swept away by the story, I loved the Varnley estate and I felt I was experiencing everything as if I was right there with them. I laughed, I cried and didn't want it to end.

I'm bullying my fellow bloggers to read it and I keep talking about it.Thing is there are plenty of faults with the plot and writing in general, but it's just such a compelling, powerful and magical read, that I haven't noticed much of that while I was blazing through The Dark Heroine *grinning*First of all, it's a gritty, violent, sexy and pretty raw read. The main character, 17 year-old Violet is not a damsel in distress, she is a daughter of a powerful man who just happened to be in a wrong place in the wrong time. She sees a massacre of vampire hunters by a bunch of young arrogant vampires, who sweep her away to their manor in the countryside. The rule is: humans who know of their existence are killed or turned. However, when vamps find out who Violet's father is, either choice will bring both societies on a brink of war.So, snarky, stubborn and get even Violet stays in the manor as a hostage, gets embroiled in complicated vampire politics and develops hate/love/weird friendship relationships with a young, vicious vampire prince, Kaspar Varn. I did not move, still rubbing my chest. \u201cMy name is not \u2018Girly\u2019! It\u2019s Violet!\u201d  Like a shot he was just inches away from me, forcing me against the wall as his hand wrapped around my neck. A single finger was pressed against my vein, stroking it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the fucking Prince!\u201d he snarled, grip tightening. My eyes widened and I struggled under him but his grip just tightened. I closed my eyes, not wanting to see his face, so close to mine and reeking of blood. A single image flooded my mind behind myclosed eyes: the lifeless body of Claude Pierre, crumpled and bleeding on the stone flag. \u201cI could snap that pretty neck of yours in two with less effort than it would take for you to squeal,\u201d he whispered in my ear. \u201cSo I suggest that you do what we say, because you can\u2019t outrun us and the police won\u2019t stop us.\u201dKaspar *sigh*, he is a a dreamy, dreamy monster. He is a proper anti-hero, and by all means I should have hated him for being a jerk and all. He kills, he maims, he is being cruel and cold, and yet at the same time, there are certain reasons for his behaviour, and the more he connects with Violet the more they are both changing. She acquires some of his ruthlessness and he softens up.According to urban dictionary, kaspary is a level of awesomeness so high it kicks you in the ass and leaves you breathless and bewildered. So here you go, Abigail Gibbs created a new word for us to use :DThere is a complicated plot of vampire mannerisms and rituals, an ancient prophecy and even different dimensions, so I wouldn't call this book your average vampire YA. Oh, and the vampire balls are alien and magical!There is also plenty of violence and some sex involved, the latter shows how blatantly screwed modern teenager's views on women and how a girl should perceive herself. I don't blame Abigail for that because she writes what she knows, however it is sad that young girls feel that they deserve so little respect.The world Abigail Gibbs built is an ambitious one. It's also very flexible, so I wouldn't really know what to expect from the book two. It just reads like a twisted, dark fairy-tale. I only know that book #2 is on my autobuy list and that this 18 year old British author has a wonderful potential for growth, if she can write like that at her age.Very much recommended. I...uhm... even made a playlist for this book on YouTube. Embarrassing, I know..."}, {"userName": "Donna {Book Passion for Life}", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3024878-donna-book-passion-for-life", "userReview": "He sighed, his hands tangling themselves in my already-knotted hair. \u201cViolet, don\u2019t ever leave me. Whatever happens; however things get, just don\u2019t go. Please.\u201d4.5 stars The Dark Heroine is an absolutely fantastic debut novel by author Abigail Gibbs. I had no idea that this author was only 15-years-old when she wrote this novel, and wow, does she have a talent because this is one exciting page turner. Violet Lee is a seventeen-year-old who is trying to get over her failed relationship with her ex-boyfriend. While out clubbing one night, Violet witness\u2019s a horrific murder but it\u2019s no ordinary murder, the people killed were murdered by \u2013 vampires. Violet\u2019s world is turned upside from this discovery because a vampire called Kaspar, takes Violet as his prisoner and brings her home to his family. While there Violet finds herself trying to fight her attraction to Kaspar Varn \u2013 even though she despises everything he is. Not only that, but she starts suffering from weird dreams \u2013 one\u2019s she knows are real. But how can dreams be real? Soon she finds out her life is being played out by fate and Kaspar is just as much as a part of it as her. I loved this book, absolutely loved it and author Abigail Gibbs really managed to suck me all the way through. At night time, I had to force myself to go to bed because otherwise I would have stayed up all night reading and that is not good \u2013 especially when I have to work the next day. I fell in love with everything about this novel, the characters, the setting, the romance, the danger \u2013 everything. The Dark Heroine really does have a little bit of everything for everyone. It\u2019s full of suspense with exciting twists and turns, it\u2019s full of intense and engaging scenes and the story really does manage to capture your heart and make you fall in love with it. Violet really is a great protagonist. She\u2019s fun and feisty and even when she\u2019s in trouble or even when she's sad, she tries to stand up for herself. She even puts herself in Kasper\u2019s firing line by pulling a few pranks on him, now this may not seem bad, but if you\u2019ve read this book then you will know that Kasper is not one to mess around with. He\u2019s scary! I loved how she was willing to stand up to him because it made the story so much fun. Even though Kasper is scary and of course bad, there is a good side to him and that good side is really, really good. I loved sweet, loving, caring Kasper. I loved how he was with Violet even though there were so many problems in their way. I\u2019m dying to see what comes next for them because they have some tough times ahead. I really struggled between rating this book a 4.5 rating and a 5, but I finally settled on 4.5 because even though I loved it, I still felt there was more room at the end of the story, that the author could have took. I guess I just wanted more of Violet and Kasper\u2019s story because where it ended was a very important scene - I felt like there should of been a little bit more. Now I\u2019m not sure how much more details we\u2019ll get about Violet and Kasper because the next book; Autumn Rose is about another character but I\u2019m praying we will see something from Violet and Kasper. Overall, The Dark Heroine is a dark and dangerous tale \u2013 one that is highly enjoyable and loveable and I will be keeping an eye out for more work by this author."}], "description": "The sexiest romance you\u2019ll read this year\u2026One moment can change your life forever...For Violet Lee, a chance encounter on a darkened street draws her into a world beyond her wildest imaginings, a timeless place of vast elegance and immeasurable wealth \u2013 of beautiful mansions and lavish parties \u2013 where a decadent group of friends live for pleasure alone.
