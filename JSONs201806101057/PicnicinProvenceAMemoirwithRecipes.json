I made the recipes, absorbed the advice, laughed with her misadventures while watching the bikes travel through France.This book is more than just a memoir. It is a journey of self discovery, enjoying life , simplifying and finding the career that fits. This is also a cookbook, filled with tasty recipes, filled with fresh whole ingredients, seasonal and healthy. There are some very important life lessons learned, simple common sense no voodoo magic or doctor visits necessary. Honest, eyeopening and educational.When a city girl from New York, marries a frenchman and moves overseas her life is already altered to the extreme. While on a historical hunting adventure through France they stumble onto a town that will alter their lives in a massive way. They buy an old home, previously lived in by a French poet, her husband admires, they get pregnant, change career plans and directions, and she learns to function as local, slowly and sometimes painfully.Her moments with the French government, child care, child birth and attitude of raising children is eyeopening. They seem to have such a better grasp on the humanity of bringing children into the world and the woman's needs. The governmental laid back attitude is a hard adjustment for her, as it would be for any of us who are always rushed to finish, get ahead, to get their first.I found some of the lessons she learned useful in my own life. Her happiness in infectious! A slight adjustment in my attitude has made a nice change. I have one phrase stuck in my head that came from a man who commented when she broke the unwritten rule of eating while on the go \"Watch your kilos\" The diet/meal schedule was simple. I gave it a go for 3 weeks, my family loved the large lunches, the soups and fresh breads for dinner, the fresh fruit desserts and didn't miss snacking at all.I am going out to get her other book Lunch in Paris this week.Thank you Goodreads for offering this in your giveaway that I won. :D"}, {"userName": "Madeline Chamberlain", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30888566-madeline-chamberlain", "userReview": "More France, less emotion, please.I read this book for a summer vacation escape, not for an angsty foray into feelings of inadequate parenting."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1521829-chris", "userReview": "In 2011, it was just dumb luck that I came across Elizabeth Bard\u2019s first food memoir, Lunch in Paris, A Love Story with Recipes, while I was perusing the food memoir section at a bookstore. A story of living in Paris, meeting the man of your dreams, it was a truly fun story and one of the better food memoirs I\u2019ve read. So imagine my delight when I was in the same section of the same bookstore (the Northshire in Manchester, Vermont. It has the BEST food memoir selection I\u2019ve ever seen!) to find that Bard has continued writing and has moved to Provence!Picnic in Provence, a Memoir in Recipes is a true delight. Now married to Gwendal and in tow with tiny Alexandre, Bard retells the story of finding the small town of C\u00e9reste in the heart of Provence, where she and her family move into the home of poet Ren\u00e9 Charr. Now she\u2019s not a visitor, she is entrenched in day-to-day village life. And what I liked about this is Bard shows us life in another country as well as her vulnerable side; as a new mother, she writes about her questions and fears with her son when it appears he prefers his father to her. The back and forth of should she give up her U.S. citizenship to become a French citizen? (She does.) What it\u2019s like to be an American living in a country where there is a certain \u201cstyle,\u201d ie. French women don\u2019t get fat. One of my favorite chapters was when her friend, Courtney, visited. A woman who suffered from bulimia and binge-eating, Bard turns to look at her own eating habits and those of France vs. the U. S. \u201cA French diet is a balancing act. If you eat a little extra dessert at dinner, you have a bowl of soup or a plate of steamed vegetables the next day for lunch. I call it the quiet diet. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but mine.\u201d Throughout it all, Bard gives us mouth-watering recipes and food descriptions. \u201cThere\u2019s something a little greedy about roasted tomatoes. Slick with olive oil and mellowed with garlic, pulpy like a supermarket romance novel, they are my attempt at pleasure hoarding. I want to be able to peek into the freezer in December and know I can use this spark of sunshine to light up a winter pasta sauce or guarantee a sensational base for braised veal shank or white beans.\u201d (I\u2019ll be doing that this summer.) French cooking isn\u2019t about fancy cooking with sauces, most of it is simple, local, fresh food since you go to the market regularly throughout the week. White Beans with Tomatoes and Herbs, Zucchini Gratin, Lentil and Sausage Stew, Arugula Salad with Chicken, Fresh Figs, and Avocado, Mulled Wine Roasted Plums. (Is your mouth watering yet?) I won\u2019t spoil the ending for you like the book jacket did for me (grrr), but I have a feeling in the next few years I will find yet another chapter in Bard\u2019s food life on the shelf of a bookstore. If I\u2019m lucky enough."}, {"userName": "Roxanne Meek", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12242926-roxanne-meek", "userReview": "I absolutely adored this book.

I'd love a copy of the book for my own library."}, {"userName": "Chelsea Alexa (A Bookish Occasion)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46107999-chelsea-alexa-a-bookish-occasion", "userReview": "\"The plums gave way, exchanging their springiness for a comforting sag. The wine bubbled into a spiced burgundy syrup, thick and glossy. I served it with faisselle, a mild spoon-able cheese, though I sense that sour cream, Greek yogurt, or mascarpone wouldn't go amiss.\" I read Elizabeth Bard's first book Lunch in Paris: A Love Story, with Recipes probably over a year ago now, but I remember absolutely falling in love with the way in which she paints a scene with her words; I felt like I was walking down the Paris streets with Bard, a New York native, tasting the crisp, buttery and chewy croissants, and discovering my own self as she discovers hers. The same worldly fears and anxieties that follow me as I grow closer to the 'big 30' seem to plague Bard as well in her similar age, and so not only did I connect with her in her first book on a foodie level, but on a personal one as well. When we last saw Bard at the end of her previous book, she had finally settled in Paris with her French lover-turned-husband and was beginning to feel more comfortable in her expat skin. In this second memoir of hers, we are once again treated to an excellent collection of delicious French recipes that I cannot wait to try out (I've made a handful from her first book and let me just say, they are damn good!), as well as yet another intimate look into her personal journey as she now navigates her life not only as a new resident in a tiny village in Provence but as a new mother to their now toddler son.Bard has a way of really bringing the reader into the scene, as if they themselves were right there in the room with her. She is funny, self-deprecating, and easily able to point out her own flaws, adding a healthy dose of humour to many of her stories. Yet there is also depth and a quiet sensitivity that she brings as well, especially when writing about her relationship with her son. At first, the so-called natural mother-child bond does not come easily to Bard, and once their son leaves babyhood and enters toddler-hood she finds that she no longer knows her 'place' within the family unit and has a very difficult time believing in herself and her capabilities as a mother, shrugging off such parental 'duties' like story-time and playtime to her more naturally-suited husband. This is definitely both a difficult and sensitive topic and one that many mothers would not easily admit to, though I'm sure many do feel inadequate at least one time or another during motherhood, as becoming a parent truly is a life-altering event in one's life. This among many others is just one of the reasons why I so enjoyed reading these two books because Bard does not shy away from the 'hard stuff,' nor does she try to put a sunny spin on otherwise difficult moments for the sake of the reader or offending anyone. She is an open and heartfelt writer who obviously lives with her heart on her sleeve, and I appreciate her honesty about life's ups and downs all the more for it. Not to mention that I absolutely adored escaping into the French countryside and reading about all the funny idiosyncrasies about village life in Provence, from nosy yet aloof neighbours, to picking Saffron by the pound by hand and making your own cheese and milk (okay, obviously not everyone does that!), and of course imagining just exactly how amazing those lavender fields really smell like in real life! \"I stood across the street and watched the sun glinting off the giant bubbles as they wobbled into the air. Alexandre ran with his arms lifted to the sky, the sun shining through his blond hair. He won't remember this part of his childhood, but I will. His pants are too short; he's grown so much over the summer.\"I had a hard time rating this book, going back and forth between 3.5 and 4 out of 5 stars, simply because I found that the last 5 or so chapters did drag on and I began to lose interest - the latter part of the book focuses mostly on how Bard and her husband open their own ice cream shop, called Scaramouche, in their village of C\u00e9reste, and for me it just wasn't that compelling. The book is also quite lengthy at just shy of 400 pages, and unfortunately I found I really had to push through to the end even though I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of it. Despite this, I do still recommend it and will definitely read anything else Bard writes. If you enjoy decadent, French Cuisine-inspired recipes coupled with intelligent, humorous and thoughtful reflections on life as an expat (and life in general), then give this lovely memoir a go. Not only is it an easy, flowing kind of read that seems to mirror the romanticized, gently-paced life of the south of France, but it is also brimming with sensitive and touching moments that anchor the book in reality."}, {"userName": "Nathaly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21923894-nathaly", "userReview": "Iritoval ma cel\u00fd Piknik.

And that perhaps I had given her previous book too much credit. I realize now I should have had complete faith in my tastes earlier in the year, and that I would enjoy this book just as much as I did the first one.It's something about her writing style and the way the story often revolves around food that just makes this such a relaxing read. Because believe me, a relaxing read is something I need at this point in the year. I don't really know how else to describing her writing as anything but relaxing, it has a certain poetic tone to it but at the same time is more than readable.Once again I had points where I didn't agree with her words or tone on certain issues but as I said before, these points were far and few and didn't detract from the story in the slightest. But that's the only real flaw that comes to mind for me.That and some french passages left untranslated, which didn't so much as annoy me as it might for another purely because I saw of it as more of a learning opportunity, something to google quickly really."}, {"userName": "Jamie Barringer (Ravenmount)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5877880-jamie-barringer-ravenmount", "userReview": "I won a copy of this book free through Goodreads First Reads. I'll definitely have to pass this one on to my mom so she can read it and try the recipes, but not till I've copied down the recipes I want to make soon. This book is not just a memoir about food. The author, an American, talks about being a mother and about getting used to life in a small town in France, after living for years with her French husband in Paris. Along the way she shows some of what makes French lifestyles so alluring to many younger Americans I know, the low-stress, healthy foods and balance approach to life that differs quite a lot from the culture I and most people I know were raised in. Bard is not replacing her American background, though, just incorporating her past into her current life in France, so this is not an American-bashing book, and she has some interesting perspectives on American life along the way, too. My copy of this book was an uncorrected proof copy, so it had quite a few typos and sentences in need of editing, and there was no index or 'about the author' in my copy, just blank pages, which may come in handy for making recipe notes if I get my book back after Mom's read it."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13546898-carolyn", "userReview": "Picnic in Provence by Elizabeth Bard is a delightful, inspiring novel set mainly in Provence, France.

Ten years ago, New Yorker Elizabeth Bard followed a handsome Frenchman up a spiral staircase to a love nest in the heart of Paris. Now, with a baby on the way and the world's flakiest croissant around the corner, Elizabeth is sure she's found her \"forever place.\" But life has other plans. On a last romantic jaunt before the baby arrives, the couple take a trip to the tiny Provencal village of C\u00e9reste. A chance encounter leads them to the wartime home of a famous poet, a tale of a buried manuscript and a garden full of heirloom roses. Under the spell of the house and its unique history, in less time than it takes to flip a crepe, Elizabeth and Gwendal decide to move-lock, stock and Le Creuset-to the French countryside.When the couple and their newborn son arrive in Provence, they discover a land of blue skies, lavender fields and peaches that taste like sunshine. Seduced by the local ingredients, they begin a new adventure as culinary entrepreneurs, starting their own artisanal ice cream shop and experimenting with flavors like saffron, sheep's milk yogurt and fruity olive oil. Filled with enticing recipes for stuffed zucchini flowers, fig tart and honey & thyme ice cream, Picnic in Provence is the story of everything that happens after the happily ever after: an American learning the tricks of French motherhood, a family finding a new professional passion, and a cook's initiation into classic Provencal cuisine. With wit, humor and scoop of wild strawberry sorbet, Bard reminds us that life-in and out of the kitchen-is a rendez-vous with the unexpected.", "title": "Picnic in Provence: A Memoir with Recipes", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22875075-picnic-in-provence", "average": 3.82, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412067439l/22875075.jpg", "reviews": 231, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2910499.Elizabeth_Bard", "name": "Elizabeth Bard"}], "type": ["Autobiography", "Nonfiction", "Food and Drink", "Travel", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22875075-picnic-in-provence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25430252-picnic-in-provence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25643275-picnic-in-provence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6422680-lunch-in-paris", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31420726-dinner-chez-moi", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12422656-best-paris-stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
