For Lainey, her fascination and sensual pull to James is both heavenly and hellish as he scorches her mind and body one minute, then gives her the deep freeze the next. Past romances are coming back into Lainey\u2019s life, are they truly hoping for another chance or is there something else behind their unsolicited attentions? Is there a reason James can appear to be a little too close to another senior lawyer, while Lainey cannot even speak to men she has known? Is it driving her to deceive James to keep the peace? Is this any way to have a relationship? Is everything she has heard about James true? When they are apart, he wants her, when they are together he holds back any weakness, always needing control.Lainey is clearly a target on someone\u2019s \u201chit\u201d list, but why? Welcome back into the chaos that seems to rule Lainey and James every step of the way as doubt creeps into their on again, off again relationship. And again, Ava Hayworth brings erotic romance and suspense back together in BEGUILE HER as James and Lainey continue to bewitch, bother and bewilder each other from the bedroom to the boardroom with raw need and possessiveness while still holding back on heart to heart conversations in the name of personal defense.Ms. Hayworth isn\u2019t asking anyone to like her characters, they are both terribly flawed and one of them is certainly out of her depth. Is James playing with Lainey? Why would Lainey accept being under someone\u2019s thumb? We all express our emotions in different ways, for these two, it is through scorching hot intimacy and a game of control or be controlled. Although their relationship could be called inappropriate for the work place, Ms. Hayworth presents intriguing slices of lives we can only imagine, good or bad. Her writing is sensual and bold. Her plot is twisted and often dark and the angst level can rise at the drop of hat. The question is, will these two ever take the opportunity to just BE? Or will the world capsize their affair like a raft on the sea of doubt?This novella based series has more steam then the best soap opera as lust and love compete for first place.I received this copy from Ava Hayworth in exchange for my honest review.Series: Laws of Seduction - Book 2Publisher: Ava Hayworth (June 29, 2016)Publication Date: June 29, 2016Genre: Romantic erotica | SuspensePrint Length: 98 pagesAvailable from: AmazonFor Reviews & More: http://tometender.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": " Lissa Smith Reads'~Bookaholics Bookshelf Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5324453-lissa-smith-reads-bookaholics-bookshelf-reviews", "userReview": "2 Stars: Kindle Unlimited Read\u2026.PAUSE REVIEW.....RANT TIME.....First off... I was passed off when I finished because when I went Amazon and low and behold the last book in the 3 book series is NOT offered on kindle unlimited. Talk about a waste of my time. I wish now that I didn't start the series. This just freaking blows.REVIEW BACK IN PROGRESS.....In the beginning I was a little bit confused about what the check was going on. So much so that I went back and read the last chapter of book 1 again. I was right... there was a time line of events that was edited out but we were supposed to know what the hell was going on. Book 1 ended with a phone call from her brother. But that wasn't picked back up until later. BTW, this book also ends with a phone call from the brother.Makes you wonder, right???The leading man may or may not be playing the leading lady. However, someone has it out for the young lady but the million-dollar question is who??? Unfortunately, this reader will never know because book three is not on kindle unlimited and that is where my book money is appointed. I didn\u2019t like the book. However, the characters were borderline from unlikable to a few exceptions the plot was a bit poor. The writing was poor at worst and bad at best. I developed some interest in the book but not enough to sustain me. If part of a series, at least one thing peeked my interest to continue. Even though the plot was uninteresting, not original or unique in any way and contained an overload of pretense, the romance was a little better but the romance was still flawed. The male/female lead was possibly abusive, verbal/physical or both, boring, or had no to very little chemistry with love interest, etc. Everything was too easily predictable. \nOverall, ok maybe some redeeming value!"}, {"userName": "Dawn West", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57276966-dawn-west", "userReview": "Actual rating: 3.5**Disclaimer: I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for honest review.** I read all four novellas in this series, back to back, in a single day! So I will review the series as a whole, mostly because it feels like a single story to me, anyway.This series really does have it all! Naughty workplace love, steamy romance, mystery, backstabbing... It's definitely a roller coaster ride.Lainey is a new lawyer, ready to find her place in the world and eager to start working after school. She has applied to several firms in the city and is hopeful that her years of being studious will pay off. After attending a workshop, she happens to find herself sitting on a train, next to a delicious lawyer who makes her heart pound and defenses crumble.James is definitely not the committed type. Well, to anything other than his work, that is. He likes his women easy to catch and gone in the morning. After Lainey lets her guard down and spends an amazing night in James' arms, she wakes to find his bed cold and empty.Fast forward a few months and Lainey has finally snagged a job and ready to focus on her future and put her one-night-stand with James behind her. Unfortunately, fate has other plans and Lainey discovers that her new job has an extra perk: James. It's the perfect chance for them to rekindle their flame, right?Or something like that...James has done his best to ignore his thoughts of the delicious woman he regrets walking out on. And yet, here she shows up in firm, taunting him with her curves and making it incredibly hard to focus on keeping his wits about him.Soon, neither James nor Lainey can avoid their chemistry and a secret office romance ensues. And as always, secrecy leads to complications. Jealous coworkers, scheming artists, and overprotective brothers all cause problems for the already strained relationship between the couple.I found the plot of the story to be quite enjoyable. I love the forbidden-type romances, so of course the office romance is included in that theme. And I liked the way the author began the journey, letting the two come together without any pretenses of work or responsibility between them. Just two people who met on a train with intense chemistry between them.The life's complications did feel contrived, at times. It seemed that there were arrows flying at the couple from every angle. All characters were suspects and even the main couple were guilty of deceiving each other. It's a lot of strife and angst and felt like the couple was arguing in almost every chapter.Regardless, I did find myself rooting for James and Lainey to find happiness with each other, despite it all. The ending left me wanting, which explains my rating. There is a plot thread that isn't tied up in the concluding novella and an epilogue or another installment would be necessary to finish the story.This is also one of the times when I think a dual POV would have made the story more enjoyable. It was hard to gauge James' true feelings at times and a peek inside his head would have helped me to connect with him. Just an idea for the author to keep in mind for the future. More of the studly main squeeze is never a bad thing!In closing... A angsty romance with lots of steamy love scenes and mystery. A good read with a little extra, so 3.5 suns!Full review on blog: http://uptildawnbookblog.blogspot.com/2016/09/review-tour-laws-of-seduction-series-by.html"}, {"userName": "Viveka", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39991287-viveka", "userReview": "received this series as a part of brazenbookshelves advent calendar. Got as far as chapter five in book two and had to give it up (which I VERY rarely do). The writing was poor, all in present tense (even when it should have been past tense, like during flashbacks), which made it very difficult to understand. The entirety was from the leading lady's pov which didn't lend a lot of insight into the leading mans personality or feelings and at several spots it seemed like parts were missing and the characters were referring to things and scenes that were never described. The only reason that I'm giving this series a 2 is that it did have great potential, which makes me even sadder, I hate a good idea and plot go to waste!"}, {"userName": "Heather B", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58103373-heather-b", "userReview": "This is a captivating series by Ava Hayworth, full of intrigue, suspense, and romance.
