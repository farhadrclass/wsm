The first essay is just so completely different than the rest of the book in every way, McSweeney's really should have made it a standalone book. In fact, I'm just going to review it on its own as if that's how it had been, because I'm going to remember it that way anyhow. After that I'll do a gloss of the rest of the book, because that's what each section deserves.\"Tristes Tropiques.\"This slim little 95-page flit absolutely destroyed me. Destroyed. Me. I was so dazzled and ruined I couldn't see straight. I actually read this on a sunny wintertime beach vacation, because for some reason I was expecting Hilton to be a wry old sassy queen, dishing archly about the silly tawdriness of the world. I was not expecting this utterly gutting pathos, the yawning horror of dismay and despair in the face of mortality, the essential existential howl at the center of being alive. 1992 was the year my beloved K died from AIDS, and I spent 1990, 1991, and 1992 in a kind of couple daze. I was an I, an opera of feeling with a very small audience, a dream of love growing ever more expansive because it was impossible, especially in the gay bars I sometimes frequented, where AIDS loved everyone up the wrong way\u2014in any case night sweats were a part of the conversation people weren't having in those bars, in any case, taking your closest friend in because he was shunned by his family was part of the conversation people weren't having, still, there was this to contend with: that friend's shirt collars getting bigger; still, there was this to contend with: his coughing and wheezing in the little room off your bedroom because TB was catching, your friends didn't want you to get it; not to mention the grief in his eyes, you didn't want to catch that; those blue eyes filled with why? causing your heart to look away, a chid's question you couldn't answer: what happened to our plans, why was the future happening so fast?andI stayed at a friend's house, it was near the bay and, at night, not sleeping, I could hear the waves, it was as Virginia Woolf corny as that, they lapped up to the shore of Mrs. Vreeland's illness, one after another, becoming myself as the world inevitably becomes yourself as you lay there in love, and your love is dying.Love and loss and AIDS and death. Sickness and defiance and sexuality and sex. Family and intellect and twinning and grief and rage. Reading this is like being punched, repeatedly, by beauty and horror and fury and sorrow all at once. Devastating and brilliant and awful and true. The rest of the bookMeh. These essays are all smart, but they're very rangy and often bloated and generally not that gripping. There's lit theory about Capote and McCullers and Welty and O'Connor, racial theory about Malcolm X's mother and Hilton's brother, musical theory about Eminem and Michael Jackson. There's queerness and blackness and drag and Richard Pryor. But it's all diffuse and intellectualized and rendered at a deep remove\u2014nothing comes close to the trenchant pierce of Book 1.So the point is: buy White Girls immediately, and read \"Tristes Tropiques\" immediately, and cry and wail and rend your garments. And then maybe stick the book in your bathroom and dip into it once in a while when the mood strikes you, but don't expect too much of it."}, {"userName": "A", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/242165-a", "userReview": "Probably the most insufferably pretentious book I've ever read -- and this is coming from a big Wayne Koestenbaum fan.I love Hilton Als's writing in The New Yorker -- fascinating little queer reveries disguised as theater reviews -- and I love his public persona of a sort of curmudgeonly, erudite vamp. So I guess I'd like to meet the brilliant doctor who gave Als the full frontal lobotomy that caused him to pinch off this unreadable turd of a book. Or maybe I should blame the editor (are there editors at McSweeneys?) who let Als ramble on about graspingly obvious or uninteresting things while allowing him to only hint at his actually interesting thoughts on gender and race before drowning them in diarrhoetic torrents of abstruseness.Child, if you're going to wait 14 years to write a book, don't bother."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/591296-amanda", "userReview": "It feels cheap to use adjectives such as \"stunning,\" and \"remarkable\" to describe White Girls when Hilton Als does so much more with language in his work. The opening essay, \"Tristes Tropiques,\" pushes language past its tipping point and creates some new, dazzling purpose with it. Simply put, this isn't how language is supposed to work, and yet it does. Readers are first thrown into an autobiographical investigation concerning Als' relationships - from friends, lovers, family, and the like - but this is no mere existential query about people's affect on one another. Als' words generate a hazy, often dream-like interpretation of the self in contemporary times, one that draws upon looming questions of race, gender, and sexuality in the late 20th century. Others have compared his style to stream-of-consciousness, but Als does much more than that; he has tight control over his meaning and purpose, deftly weaving between his memories of the past and his larger critical interpretation of those moments. It's hard to accurately articulate exactly what he does, because it defies any easy categorization. Is it autobiography? Is it cultural criticism? It's both in some remarkable format that must be experienced to be believed. From this first essay, Als moves into a series of essays revolving around cultural criticism, each one a close reading in literature, film, or another cultural medium. It's been quite some time since a book of criticism grabbed me the way Als' does; in a somewhat over-used cliche, I simply could not put the book down."}, {"userName": "Joanna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2253702-joanna", "userReview": "I am just gonna have to accept that there is a certain kind of writing, a certain kind of way of making art and text, that just does not do it for me. At all. Because I don't consume media to become intimate with the creator of the media I'm consuming. I want to get into the actual media itself. I don't go, oh look at the creative person's intelligence, their emotions, their sensitivity and cleverness. I don't care. At all. I know this is at odds with the way some people, the tasteful people, prefer to consume media. For them, watching movies and TV and reading books is, on some level, enjoying the sweetness of a relationship, so the author, the auteur is important because that is the person they are having a relationship with. So they know writers' biographies! They decide to watch a director's movies without knowing what it's about beforehand! They have listened to a band's entire catalog, even the shit albums! I cannot understand this, beyond having a crush on someone's image, because come on, that is all that you are really doing, right? I notice these people also have the most difficulty with video games. ANYWAY. This book is for those people. This book is nothing but intimacy with Hilton Als! Must be like candy to them. I didn't really care though. I actually prefer discussions on race, gender, pop culture, etc. to state their purpose and ideas explicitly, like in academic writing. Or as themes in straight forward fiction."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54697-matt", "userReview": "I'd heard a lot about Als's book through the literary buzz generated from its publication in McSweeney's in autumn of last year. The Millions mentioned it as one of the year's best reads and the stacks of blurbs on the back were hyperventilating in their approbation. I'd read one of Als's essays before in Harper's, about gender and sexuality and it was stylistically interesting as much as it was philosophically compelling. A rare find, that. So I got it for Xmas from my no-doubt-befuddled parents and gave it a look.... Tristes Tropiques, the opening chapter, was very profound, complex and moving: a true cri de coeur as much as a structural and linguistic tour de force. Als puts his eloquent, digressive, confessional-yet-coolly-analytical style right up at you without pause or apology and the effect is almost overpowering in its uncompromising insight. It's personal, it's political, it's prosaic, it's pointed. Als doesn't merely blur the lines between genres and topics, messing with accepted categories of knowledge, he capably and brilliantly veers in and out of them. One minute he's talking about his ex-lover, the next it's a French novel, then it's his parents, his friend's clothes, painful memories of his youthful eczema, meeting Jean-Michel Basquiat at a party back in the day, a moment in a conversation, the look on a person's face when they watch a movie, and on and on... I don't mean to make this sound like Als is self-indulgent or sloppy. He isn't. It's more that Als has such an enviably sure grip on his prose style that he can tack gracefully from one topic to another, one emotion to another, one insight to the next, so that he can do that he wants to get the effect he desires: disorient the reader if he wants to shake them up or to turn a memory over for it to catch the light a certain way.  And, as with all good writers, the style is substance. The form is the function. They find a way to tell the old verities and the truths of the heart by making it new.  Als wants to tell you about Otherness, hidden memories, vibrant but tattered subcultures and the discontents of being queer, black, and ultra-sensitive and deeply intelligent amid the moronic inferno. If you don't mind his unique and challenging prose style (and you shouldn't!) there is a tremendous amount of bitter wisdom, aphoristic pith, heartbreaking loss, poetic reminiscence, caustic social criticism and erudite analysis available to you.  And then there's his literary criticism...  Als's take on Flannery O'Connor was a fine appraisal, taking her seriously and not mistaking the Georgian for the trees. His take on the controversial life of Louise Brooks \"whom no man will ever have\" is also great. Especially his detailed case study on the life and career trajectory of the brilliant, doomed Richard Pryor and of Louise Helen Norton, the tragically muted mother of Malcolm X: 'where's HER autobiography' is a very powerful and brilliant question. As is her status as an eponymous \"white girl.\" Which is sort of where the problems begin.  I wasn't persuaded by his take on Eminem's ersatz blackness. It's not that I'm an essentialist when it comes to racial matters, it's more that I'm not sure that poverty, geography, musical style, or cultural environment confer the same status or experience as someone of a different race. Eminem is a very talented guy, no question, but a, so to speak, 'white'/'black' guy? Nah, not buying it... I mean, there is a certain level of empathy, even solidarity, that Eminem might properly feel with members of other races due to being brought up in scandalously oppressive conditions, but the fact of his being white still means he's most likely able to go places and do things which other people who don't look like him cannot go and do and be. Not really. This isn't Eminem's fault, surely, but I think race can't just be delineated through a set of particular social signifiers- the world is too fucked up for it to be that simple. Or that complex.  Maybe this makes more sense: Als writes about Truman Capote's infamous, seductive, doe-eyed author photo on the back of Other Voices, Other Rooms signifying to the world \"I am a woman.\" And then he analyzes Capote's career in that light- competition with his more macho contemporary writers like Mailer and betraying the trust of the high society dames he'd assiduously courted by novelizing their very private lives, etc...Again, not really buying this line of thought. I mean, Capote might well have been TRYING to signify that he was a woman, or at least his own idea of one, or perhaps society's, but that doth not a female make. It would be reductive (not to say insulting to women everywhere) to suggest otherwise. Social signification only goes so far. Biology isn't destiny, but neither is semiotic performance. I might be misreading Als here, but he does seem to lean rather hard on the idea of race and gender as being products of social signifiers, performances, codes.  Als's appraisals of Gone With The Wind and the phenomenon of Michael Jackson were interesting but not as fleshed-out as I'd hoped they would be. Maybe he didn't feel like he needed to go further, but It seemed to me that both these essays were finishing just as they were getting started.  All in all, the book is very challenging, in the best way- consistently engaging, complex, heartfelt but bitterly ironic (a particularly tricky feat to pull off, on the page especially) while packing the pages with material. Als is erudite, lyrical, provocative and pissed-off. In a word, important. The fact that the book was worshipfully embraced by white critics everywhere isn't, I think, a statement on the depth of literary white guilt as much as a testament to the power and the skill which Als brings to every intricate, lyrical, castigating sentence."}, {"userName": "Chris Richards", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14102551-chris-richards", "userReview": "At times, this feels so good it should be illegal.

The first essay, on the Als's experience of \"twinning\" with a loved one is my favorite; though I was pretty stunned by essays on Eminem and Richard Pryor, as well as Michael Jackson...I was stunned by most of the book, I suppose. Some interesting similarities to Kate Zambreno's Heroines, in the kind of channeling it occasionally enacts. Definitely my favorite nonfiction read since Heroines, in any case."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6915253-steve", "userReview": "Extraordinary, genre-bending cultural criticism.

The more I slowed down, took a breath, and plunged into the next sentence, the more I could feel myself sinking into the vicarious experience of something a little more sophisticated than stream of consciousness - you know, those moments where you are very aware of your physical self, in the way in which you take up space, and how the loudness of your breath seems in direct contradiction of the smallness you feel? Maybe that's just me. There are continuities in that this is a book about race, gender, queerness, and how black men can be white women and how white men can be black men too and the ways these shifting identifies inform our modern Oedipal complex (because black/white men can be 'wuzbands' to their mothers, too). It's biography of pop culture figures that have been steeped in their own myth. It is a book about the arresting effect of a voice sounding from a room that has been obscured in plain sight. It is all of these things, sometimes at once, sometimes not. It is nebulous, trying to determine White Girls' I; and in moments where the join is as breathtaking as this, it doesn't even matter: \"For some time before we were known as an 'Oh, you two!' I felt SL was my corny and ancient 'other half.' Nearly from the first I wanted to 'grow into one' with him, as Aristophanes sort of has it in Plato's Symposium. We are not lovers. It's almost as if I dreamed him - my lovely twin, the same as me, only different.\"That said, this is not an accessible read, and at times it felt less like a walk through a dazzling snowscape than it did like sloughing through that hard, dirt and gravel mixed sludge that forms when the ice can't decide whether to melt or harden. That doesn't strike me as an unintentional effect. When I finished, I didn't feel as though I gave White Girls all that I could - and as such, I can only have an opinion that is uninformed. I felt that it was tender and sharp and abasing in turns, and also, at times, incomprehensible."}, {"userName": "Adam Schlesinger", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17679742-adam-schlesinger", "userReview": "This is the type of book that you'd probably really like if you were really into deconstructions of race/gender/sexuality/class but didn't want another \"standard\" deconstructions of those things. Instead of a \"here's the critical theory background we all have let's look at these people\" he bounces around subjects and attacks them from a bunch of different intellectual angles. So like, I get what Als is doing and why its appealing to highbrow cultural critics but it doesn't appeal to me. Part of the issue is that the work is so personal and so you spend a lot of time in Als' viewpoint, but the dude seems like he'd be zero fun to hang out with; in his writing he comes off totally self-serious. Like, the only time he'd express that he found something humorous is to give a wry grin at a clever turn of phrase or an unintentional irony, but he'd never like, actually laugh at a joke. Again, that's mostly me and my preference for essays. Another reason that is that i simply lack a lot of the background of the subjects he's writing on so a lot of it is lost on me--it's very pretentious in the sense that a lot of the essays are founded on the pretense that you've read stuff about these people already and are already part of the conversation. I'd probably like the book more if he wrote an essay on figures more relevant to my pop culture experience.So yeah, this book would probably be good for a person who likes the above-mentioned things, but it was a real slog for me."}, {"userName": "Downward", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16292193-downward", "userReview": "This essay collection is a piece-by-piece, often focused on celebrities, dense treatise on identity. Als deals with famous figures (Eminem, Michael Jackson, Malcolm X, Truman Capote, and most in-depthly, Richard Pryor) through the lens of gender, sexuality and race - most often using each lens to draw a further microscopic view on the other. His views are often contrary to popular opinion, or introduce new ways of looking at figures that have already been intensely scrutinized, and his voice exists in a pre-sensitive place: Als says what he wants. The title, an eye-catcher for sure, reflects on his ability (as a gay black man) to relate to white girls (it's a lot more complicated than that), and this in turn parallels a lot of the collections themes: Eminem as black; Truman Capote as a woman, etc. The star of this show is the two essays on Richard Pryor, however, one from the perspective of his sister.

I imagine that Hilton Als told his editor, \"Hey, I'm going to go make a thing,\" and then came back a year later or whatever with this manuscript and was like, \"Well, I made the thing.\" I really enjoyed it, but I'm not sure who I would recommend it to. Don't take it to the beach with you, that's for damn sure."}], "description": "White Girls, Hilton Als\u2019s first book since The Women fourteen years ago, finds one of The New Yorker's boldest cultural critics deftly weaving together his brilliant analyses of literature, art, and music with fearless insights on race, gender, and history. The result is an extraordinary, complex portrait of \"white girls,\" as Als dubs them\u2014an expansive but precise category that encompasses figures as diverse as Truman Capote and Louise Brooks, Malcolm X and Flannery O\u2019Connor. In pieces that hairpin between critique and meditation, fiction and nonfiction, high culture and low, the theoretical and the deeply personal, Als presents a stunning portrait of a writer by way of his subjects, and an invaluable guide to the culture of our time.", "title": "White Girls", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13239419.White_Girls", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344745901l/13239419.jpg", "reviews": 303, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/35929.Hilton_Als", "name": "Hilton Als"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Writing", "Race", "Glbt", "Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13239419-white-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19172774-white-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20893857-white-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1063677.The_Women", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/656119.The_Warhol_Look", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28707.White_Noise", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22261036-robert-gober", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/656118.Drawing_Us_In"]}
