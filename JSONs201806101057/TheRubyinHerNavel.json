We are at the court of King Roger II, a Norman, who rules an ethnically diverse realm in which he tries to balance the rights of Christian and Muslim and Jew. Only the Muslims, however, seem content with this arrangement, perhaps because they comprise King Roger's most trusted counselors. He mistrusts his own people, the Normans, and for good reason as events reveal. The Catholics have just lost the Second Crusade\u2014ignominiously and with terrible loss of life\u2014so they are hardly in a mood for pluralism. They seek closer alignment with the crown, greater control of its offices and pursestrings, and expulsion of all Muslims from Sicily. Thurstan Beauchamp, the narrator, works in the palace in the Diwan of Control. He is of Norman ancestry and a Christian. His supervisor, Yusuf Ibm Mansur, seeks to train him in the arts of intrigue, for the factions are constantly conspiring against each other and Thurston's face is an open book.Some time before the present action, Thurston's dreams of knighthood were quashed when his father inexplicably turned ascetic and gave all of his worldly goods to the monastery he then entered. Thurston was thus promptly disinherited, and is understandably unhappy that his birthright should have been traded away solely for the comfort of his father's eternal soul. Now he must work for a living. His post, under Yusuf's guidance, involves travel. On his first trip of the novel he runs into his first love, Lady Alicia, who was torn from him when he was 15 or so and sent off to marry a corpulent crusader in the Holy Land. Now, 20 years later, here she is, newly widowed, on horseback, riding with groom and lady-in-waiting through some provincial backwater to which Thurston had been dispatched on an errand. His love for her and his dreams of knighthood are subsequently rekindled. In time, she expresses her belief that is was Providence that brought them together again and she announces her intention to make him her husband.There is the larger political context which undergirds the intrigues at the palace. Most threateningly, King Conrad III of Germany and Emperor Manuel I Comnenus of Byzantium are allying as a means of dethroning Roger, whom they view as a usurper, and expelling all Muslims from Sicily. It is King Roger's hope to strike up a correpondence with Conrad in an effort to break his alliance with Byzantium. The writing is emotionally affecting and the deployment of suspense masterful. Unsworth's handling of the complex plot seems effortless. There are numerous plot twists and betrayals and other surprises that I am deliberately not discussing that will set your heart pounding and curl your hair. The title story of the ruby is just one of these. This is narrative of a very high order, and the tone is beautifully modulated throughout. I liked Unsworth's Booker-winning Sacred Hunger immensely, but The Ruby In Her Navel is the finer work. Comparisons are specious, but solely in terms of artistic achievement I put the book on a par with William Styron's Sophie's Choice. It is among the limited number of great novels that one will be privileged to read in this too brief life."}, {"userName": "Philip", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1391890-philip", "userReview": "A Ruby in Her Navel is yet another superb historical novel by Barry Unsworth. By his phenomenal standards, this book might at first appear somewhat one-paced, even one-dimensional, with its action set firmly in the place and time of its main character, Thurston Beauchamp, a young man in the service of King Roger of Sicily in the twelfth century. But if A Ruby in Her Navel might lack the immediacy and complexity of Stone Virgin, it approaches the beautifully portrayed picture of medieval life presented in Morality Play. Indeed, a group of travelling players also features in this novel, as in Morality Play, but this time it\u2019s a troupe of belly dancers from Anatolia, on tour in southern Italy. The ruby and navel of the title both belong to Nasrin, the youngest, most beautiful and most provocative member of the group. But having written that they were touring Italy, a country name that in our eyes is merely mundane and perhaps innocuous, I am reminded of one of the most enduring features of Barry Unsworth\u2019s book, which is its ability to re-draw one\u2019s understanding of who we were.It was Alison Weir who first did this for me, if you see what I mean. I read her biography of Eleanor of Aquitaine, the marriageable lady who became King Henry the Second of England\u2019s queen. Again, there\u2019s the name of a country\u2026 You see, at school we British school children learned a variety of history that filtered everything through a sieve of contemporary national requirements. I can remember being taught that during the medieval era, the English ruled most of France and largely held onto it until the Wars of the Roses (I was brought up in Yorkshire, another irrelevant aside). Possessions remained until Queen Mary finally gave up Calais with a cardiac etch. Alison Weir undid a school lifetime of history when she described the Angevin Empire, part of the pan-European expansion of the Franks. Based in Anjou, this empire comprised what we now call southern, western and northern France, plus all of England and Wales, and other bits at times (though never Scotland, hence that nation\u2019s long-lasting alliance with the rival empire based on the Ile de France). When interpreted this way, it wasn\u2019t English kings that ruled France, or vice-versa. It was an empire with its own lingua franca, langue d\u2019oc. The countries, and with them the geographical, ethnic and cultural assumptions upon which we falsely base our interpretation of the past, simply did not exist. Thus the paradigms upon which we base our understanding of English-ness or French-ness become both irrelevant and inapplicable. And thus the troupe of belly dancers in A Ruby in Her Navel weren\u2019t, therefore, in Italy. They were in the Kingdom of Sicily, a small but powerful and ambitious little Norman empire created out of the same Frankish expansion that spurned the enduring conquest of the Anglo-Saxons in 1066.In A Ruby in her Navel Barry Unsworth presents medieval Europe in a way that brings the historical issues into focus and gives them life. Lands were conquered and their Muslim leaders deposed. But the new rulers had to politic their way to continued incumbency, recognising the interests of land-hungry knights, only temporarily defeated Muslim predecessors with friends nearby, Jewish merchants who did pragmatic business with anyone and everyone. And even within these groups there were divisions. Amongst the Christians there were two competing blocks, the Germanic Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine remnants of Imperial Rome. And then there was the Pope with his own empire, interests and ability to raise an army. And then there were those who aspired to power from within and sought to depose a rival in their own house. The Crusades that primary school history presents has having something to do with religion thus become mere wars of conquest for booty.In A Ruby in Her Navel Barry Unsworth thus gives immediate, tangible life to the feudalism of the time. We really do understand the politics, the interests, the motivations of the era. But we are led to it by our experience of the characters\u2019 lives, not via instruction or polemic. And the message is more powerful for Thurston Beauchamp, because he aspires to the knighthood his father relinquished in favour of monasticism. Thurston is currently King Roger\u2019s entertainments manager and has to travel to Italy (I am doing it again!) to buy herons, caged prey for the King\u2019s peregrines. He does his deal, but meets the troupe of dancers and the resulting stirrings of the spirit provoke him to ship them back home to do the same for his master. He falls in love with Nasrin, one of the group. Meanwhile Alicia, Thurston\u2019s childhood sweetheart, suddenly reappears in his life. They were at school together until she was whisked away at a marriageable fourteen to be conjoined to a knight with a big sword and real estate in the Middle East, the Norman Outremer. Alicia\u2019s husband, it seems, has now snuffed it, and again Thurston\u2019s spirits rise when he realises that she is again available, again an unaccompanied, unclaimed, newly-vacated vessel.The belly dancers go down well at home, of course, and so Thurston\u2019s star is in the ascendant. He gets a new mission, commissioned by he knows not who and which causes accounting difficulties for the Muslim \u201chead of civil service\u201d to whom he reports.By now you have probably guessed that there is a plot. And it\u2019s a vast one, involving insiders, outsiders, a pope or two, Muslims, Germans, Jews, Byzantines and all the other interests competing their share of or their consolidation of feudal power. This really is top-down government, but the trick, once power is achieved, clearly is just to hold on. And sometimes you consolidate your home base by having a fiddle or two on foreign soil, a political strategy not unknown in our own times.Our Thurston analyses the plot, works it all out and then acts to influence the outcome. Along the way he grapples with his rising dilemma in relation to Nasrin and Alicia, and thus his life is eventually transformed. As in all ages, he follows his heart (by which, of course, I mean his brain). A Ruby in Her Navel thus reveals that, as ever with Barry Unsworth, it is a multi-layered, complex, surprising and yet deeply human tale."}, {"userName": "Milan/zzz", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1218717-milan-zzz", "userReview": "Oh I love this book so much! I was so thirsty for one good historical novel and Unsworth never disappointed me so far.This book is telling story about 12th century Sicily during the rule of Normans. Curiously I watched few days ago on History channel one series about this subject and it helped me to get wider perspective about what Unsworth wrote here.12th Century Sicily was perfect place of harmony between Muslims (Saracens) and Christians (both Catholic and Byzantine) under the rule of King Roger II of Sicily. Roger drew round him distinguished men of various races, such as the famous Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi. The king welcomed the learned, and he practiced toleration towards the several creeds, races and languages of his realm. He organized a multiracial, multinational kingdom in which Arabic, Byzantine, Lombard, Jewish, and Norman cultures produced a brilliant cosmopolitan state. As such he was probably the most able ruler in 12th-century Europe.This harmony is lovely metaphor of the present days views of multiculturalism and the reasons for its end 9 centuries ago are sadly the same ones why nowadays multiculturalism can\u2019t find fertile soil.We can see how some of the magnificent monuments that still exist have been built under the influence of all three religions which is undoubtedly the reason why are so beautiful. Also we can see glimpse of medieval politics: and there Serbs are entering on the stage (I was quite surprised). Indeed Unsworth is great historian, Serbs were preparing rebellion against Byzantines. The story goes that King Roger financially supported that rebellion to distract Manuel I Komnenos, Emperor of the Byzantine Empire to attack Sicily. Indeed Serbs haven\u2019t been presented in such a perfect light but then, who could be completely positive in 12th century, age of bribes, lies, intrigues...?Unsowrth beautifully paints emotion in Christian hearts after disaster of Second Crusade as well as perfectly clear picture how greedy, bloodthirsty crusaders were and how their reasons and actions were non-Christian. I\u2019m glad they lost it (I know this must sound silly) and I am Christian. On the other hand I always had huge respect toward Arab culture and their contribution to the science. After this novel, even more.You really have to ask yourself how on earth those men of church thought they are leading Christian life? All what they\u2019ve done was lies, bribes and murders. There is one fantastic scene when man of Church, near Pope is convincing one of the character to do something very non-Christian under the fresco that is showing King Constantine how he kneels before the Pope offering him Eastern Kingdom. What Unsworth didn\u2019t tell (and how could he considering that he would jump out of the entire book) and what I\u2019ve saw at that series on History channel is that the same fresco have been used as a proof that Catholic Christianity and the Pope have legal right to take Eastern Empire and few centuries later it has been proved that the fresco is a fake. Knowing that, the scene of convincing that character to do something (I\u2019m avoiding spoilers) under the same fresco has quite profound and obviously hidden meaning.And of course there is personal story of love, loyalty, betrayal, dreams, lust \u2026 oh you name it! But all this (no matter how previous sentence sounds) couldn\u2019t be more far from clich\u00e9.Beautiful novel! I\u2019m highly recommending it!"}, {"userName": "Knjigomanijak", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16730144-knjigomanijak", "userReview": "Ako volite povijesne knjige u kojima ima svega, dakle ljubavi, \u010dulnosti i romantike, ali i spletki i intriga, svakako pro\u010ditajte ovaj roman.

When Dickens wrote of Revolutionary Paris or Tolstoy of Napoleon's march on Moscow, they were writing about people who relatively close to them in time and customs; those events had shaped the lives of the readers, whose grandparents had lived through them. The task that a novelist like Barry Unsworth sets for himself in writing about the brief period when the Normans ruled medieval Southern Italy is in many ways much more difficult. Norman Sicily far remote even from those who are conversant with Italian history. The people who lived through it are much further removed from our consciousness than the Romans who preceded them by a millennium or the Renaissance artists and princes who followed them. It was a time when Sicily, which we now know as a poverty- and crime-sricken island off the toe of Italy, was a glittering court where Latins, Byzantine Greeks and Arabs traded and even governed together. Palermo was a cosmopolitan, polyglot mercantile city with a public building and artistic program. Unsworth does very well with this, particularly with the Muslim head of a government bureau. He also seeds the plot, less successfully, with the owner of the navel of the title, dancer of the Yazidi religion (here I pause to remember the plight of the Yazidis besieged by ISIL, and fervently hope that their travail ends soon). The plot of the novel sort of lumbers along with a kind of a mystery that enmeshes the hero, Thurstan Beaumont, but the principal character is not engaging enough to make it suspenseful. In the end, Unsworth is defeated by this problem: in a time and place so radically different from our time and place, how does one create a central character who is both accessible and credible? Unsworth leans -- overmuch, in my estimation -- toward the former. Thurstan thinks and sounds relatively modern, which is to say not very medieval. In action, he is a bit truer to his time, but that is a function of the situations and decisions that Unsworth sets out for him. And perhaps the problem -- given such a remote time and place -- is insoluble, that a relatively modern-sounding narrator is inevitable. After all, Unsworth could probably not have mimicked the formality of language and religious, political and romantic ideas that appear in writing from the period and written an appealing novel at all. The example that is most galling occurs when Thurstan's king travels to meet the French Louis VII, returning from the disastrous Second Crusade with his then-wife, the very famous Eleanor of Aquitaine. An informant reliably fills Thurstan in on the travails of the crumbling marriage; Unsworth's understanding of the sacrality of medieval kingship prevents any closer proximity to the royal couple. A treatment of Eleanor was likely farther than Unsworth felt he could go, and he is probably right. But it sticks with me as the kind of opportunity lost when opening the door to such a poorly-known yet fascinating period but leaving so much unexplored."}, {"userName": "Cynthia Haggard", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5186126-cynthia-haggard", "userReview": "Barry Unsworth\u2019s THE RUBY IN HER NAVEL is a gem of a novel, hidden behind the thicket of its unpromising beginning.Set in Sicily in the 1100s during the reign of Roger I of Sicily, we follow the story of a young man named (somewhat improbably in my opinion) Thurstan Beauchamp, who travels through the world as a purveyor of the King\u2019s pleasures and shows. Naturally, there is more to this innocent-seeming job than meets the eye. Of course, Thurstan is really a spy, intent on finding out about dissension against the King both within his court and outside it.I am not a fan of narrative summary, so writers who tend to use that method of telling their stories wear thin on me. And there were times in this novel, when it lagged. But the biggest problem (apart from the dreadful cover, and the misleading, unpoetic title) was the beginning. \u201cTo begin a story one must choose a time when the door swings wide, and this came for me on a day late in April 1149.\u201dWhat a wonderful first line.

On one of these errands, Thurstan meets his childhood sweetheart, whose husband has recently died. Thurstan believes that at last he will have everything he ever wanted, but there are dark times approaching for the kingdom of Sicily, and things are not as they appear.Every now and then I like to read an adult book. You know, just to prove I can. Oh, and I can. I just chose not to most of the time. My mother had given me this one. When I was almost done with it she informed me she didn't think it was that great. To which I said, \"Why are you giving me bad books to read? Don't you know my to-read list is a million books long?\" But at that point I was almost finished. And I guess I didn't hate it enough to give up part way through. Although, to be honest, there was some skimming.Despite the cover, this book is not racy. Like, at all. What was most interesting about the story was the time it was set in. Sicily was quite interesting during the Middle Ages. It had that period where many different religions were living fairly peacefully together under the king. Keep in mind that this was a time when the Crusades were going on, so that was a pretty big deal. Unfortunately, this period didn't last forever. This story is being told right at the time when everything was beginning to deteriorate, and there were emerging feelings of hatred toward the Arab population.Thurstan is a naive little twit who thought he was much cleverer than he actually was and for most of the book I just felt sorry for him, because it was pretty clear to me from fairly early on where things were going. I wanted to cry, \"You're being played for a fool! Obviously.\" But he didn't listen. Sigh. They never listen. So I was hardly at the edge of my seat as there wasn't much of a mystery. I did keep reading to see how everything would wrap up, and it got wrapped up awfully tidily.There's a side plot with some dancers that Thurstan finds and brings to court and his relationship with one of them. That's where the title comes from. It seemed an odd choice. Perhaps something that sounded kind of racy was wanted? Even though it wasn't?So it was fine. The romance wasn't all that romancy, the intrigue wasn't all that intriguing, and the mystery wasn't all that mysterious. So...yeah. It was fine. It was no Mistress of the Art of Death.

I wished he would commit suicide and the book would end.The hero didn't commit suicide, instead the author decided that after 300 pages of monotonous boredom he should stuff and squeeze in 70% of the story still untold.Even though the author only recently passed away, his language is that of the classics. After reading \"modern\" language for many years, it was nice to read in a language we all know very well, but never use.Still, the book is crippled and the hero is unlovable.

Like last year's Father of Locks, \"The Ruby in Her Navel\" transports one into a familiar but also exotic milieu that is exquisitely rendered. This time it is the multiethnic and multireligious Norman Kingdom of Sicily at its apogee in 1149 under King Roger II. The blurb below gives a flavor of the novel's subject:\"It is 1149, and all is not well in Norman Sicily. The Second Crusade's disastrous failure has turned opinion against Palermo's Muslims, but King Roger's magnanimity toward his multicultural populace keeps the land in harmony--or so it seems. Thurstan Beauchamp, a Norman Christian, works at the government office overseeing finances, accounting, and bribes. Still smarting at the loss of his inheritance, he jumps at the chance to reconnect with Alicia, his noble childhood sweetheart. But what of Nesrin, the Anatolian belly dancer who stirs his lust? The undercurrents of political and romantic intrigue prove too much for naive, idealistic Thurstan, whose chivalrous inner core begins to crack as he travels on missions for his king...\"FORMAT/CLASSIFICATION: \"The Ruby in Her Navel\" stands at about 400 pages divided into 30 numbered chapters and is narrated by Thurstan Beauchamp. \"The Ruby in Her Navel\" is an adventure novel of intrigue, introspection, conspiracies and love, all in a superbly rendered atmosphere of a long lost culture that is both familiar and exotic.OVERVIEW/ANALYSIS: Instead of a lengthy overview, the first page of the novel which hooked me on the story tells it better:\"When Nesrin the dancer became famous in the courts of Europe, many were the stories told about the ruby that glowed in her navel as she danced. Some said it had been stolen by a lover of hers - who had gone to the stake for it - from the crown of King Roger of Sicily, others that it had been a bribe from Conrad Hohenstaufen for her help in a plot to kill that same king. The plot had failed, they said, but she had kept the ruby and paid for it in a way that contented Conrad even more than the death of his enemy, vindictive as he was.As time passed the stories ranged further and grew wilder: the gem was a gift from the Caliph of Bagdad, it was sent her by secret courier from the Great Khan of the Mongols with promises of more wealth if she would only come and dance for him and share his bed. And of course there were those who said that Nesrin was a shameless woman and the ruby was the reward of her pledge with the Devil. The troubadour who accompanied her made songs about the ruby, some happy, some sad, and this confused people even more. Neither of these two ever told the truth of it, no matter who asked, whether prince or peasant. I am the only one who knows the whole story, I, Thurstan.Any human life lies in the future as well as the past, of however short duration that future may prove to be; they are hinged together like a door that swings, and that swinging is the present moment. To begin a story one must choose a time when the door swings wide, and this came for me on a day late in the April of 1149 when Yusuf Ibn Mansur asked me to remain with him at the end of what we called the majlis, the gathering of officials that was held twice-monthly in the royal palace of Palermo.He asked me quite openly, rather carelessly, as if it were an afterthought, something that might easily been overlooked. But it was rare indeed that Yusuf overlooked anything. What better way of disarming suspicion than to speak in the hearing of all? There was nothing strange about my remaining there, about our having things to say in private: he was the Lord of the Diwan of Control and I was his subordinate in the same chancery. But secrecy was ingrained in him; and he knew, as I knew - indeed it was one of the things he had striven to teach me in the years I had served under him - that secrecy is best served by an appearance of openness.The majlis itself has stayed in my memory because it was enlivened by a quarrel. I had only recently returned from Naples, where I had made an attempt to bribe the Count's jester, a dwarf named Leo, to return with me to Palermo as a gift to the King. He had refused, though much tempted, being afraid of the Count's wrath, of being followed and strangled. This mission I had undertaken in my capacity as Purveyor of Pleasures and Shows, my official title in the Diwan of Control, a resounding one, but in fact there were only myself and my clerk and bookkeeper Stefanos and the doorman. I did not speak of this failure at the majlis; it was my practice in any case to say as little as possible at these meetings.I was distrusted as a man who belonged nowhere. I worked for a Moslem lord, I was not a Norman of France, being born in Northern England of a Saxon mother and a landless Norman knight. My father brought us to Italy in the year of Our Lord 1128, when I was still a child. He hoped to find advancement under the Norman rule, and he did so. My mother died some years later, struggling to give me a brother. My father\u2026 But more of my father later.\"So if the excerpt above does not hook you on the story, why read the novel?While Thurstan's voice is absolutely compelling to the end, the story itself is quite interesting, full of twists of turns and with foreshadowing that is quite subtle since while it gives a hint of where the story goes, the path is not straightforward.The novel is immersive and it is hard to put down until the end with the last 100 pages being non-stop suspense. The secondary characters shine throughout: the most notable is Yusuf the Moslem lord who plucked the 17 year old Thurstan whose life has just spun out of control and away from his knighthood path that he seemed firmly set on from literally childhood, out of obscurity as a King's bodyguard. Despite cultural and religious differences, Yusuf is almost like a father to Thurstan and the relationship between the two is key to the novel.Dreams die hard though and the novel illustrates this brilliantly when rich and widowed - so more or less free to choose a new husband - Thurstan's teenage flame Alicia appears seemingly out of nowhere and the old longings of the hero are resurrected to conflict with his desire of succeeding Yusuf as Diwan leader when the later ascends in the court hierarchy as well as with his infatuation with the free spirited Nesrin of the cover...The title is a bit of a red herring and the first several lines quoted above embody this misdirection, but I leave to the reader to find out why. The novel has dastardly conspirators with nefarious plots, deadly assassins, rebels and loyalists and the action interweaves seamlessly in the rich tapestry of world building and medieval discourse.\"The Ruby in Her Navel\" (A+) is another novel that came out of nowhere for me; opened by chance I just got hooked from the first page and could not stop reading it until finished, so I definitely plan to try more by the author, including his most celebrated novel the 1992 Booker winning novel Sacred Hunger that moves the scene to the 18th century and the slave trade."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/890233-maureen", "userReview": "i really like the way barry unsworth writes historical fiction. his research never overwhelms his story, and threads into the ideas he explores through the backdrop of another time: in this novel, the beauty of the mosaic art, the blend of multiple indistinguishable stones coming together in a particular shape to create beauty, is as the diverse populace of sicily in the twelfth century: some identifying as muslim, christian, others as greek, norman, german all contribute to the culture, all people, and all vie for ascendancy under the crown. the novel follows the royal purveyor, thurstan who has lost his chance at knighthood, and flounders as he attempts to find some kind of future, juggling loyalties and he narrates the story as his past to reveal the secret of the ruby. i can't give the novel the four stars that i had originally hoped. eventually i found that the repeated and clunky foreshadowing got to me (please people, stop using multiple variations of \"had i only spoken then, it might all have been different\" -- i get it, you're telling the story in the future, and you want me to feel anxiety but you do this too much and all i want to do is punch the book in the face.) the pacing is a little off -- the book takes a while to unfold, and then there's a lovely mid-section, and then unsworth seems to feel an urgent need to wrap things up quickly -- the ending felt a little abrupt. this isn't a perfect novel, but it's quite enjoyable, and i will be reading more unsworth."}, {"userName": "James (JD) Dittes", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5693583-james-jd-dittes", "userReview": "With his brilliant novel, Songs of the Kings, Unsworth moved into one of my three favorite contemporary writers. He has an eye for period detail in his historical novels, but his strength is the subtle context that comments vividly on 21st-century events.For example, Songs of the Kings, when it appeared in 2003, used Odysseus to demonstrate the madness of kings, and the relative ease with which they use saga to lead individuals to their doom. Three months after its release, the Iraq War began.In The Ruby in her Navel, Unsworth brings to life a multi-cultural, multi-religious Sicily. It is one of the great European kingdoms, but there is trouble brewing. The utter failure of the 2nd Crusade has raised suspicions against Palermo's muslim population. Latin Lombards are moving in to challenge the Norman elite. The Byzantine Empire has Sicily in its sights, too.It makes for a lousy time for Thurstan Beauchamp to fall in love. Seeking advancement--a possible knighthood--for himself as well as his Saracen patron: his naievete about the church and the king is put to the test. When his loyalty to king isn't tested, his loyalty to two ladies is.For the last 250 pages, I just couldn't put this book down.

He'd have warranted better on the strength of his historical novels, which are meticulously researched, extremely evocative of their time and place, and have a lyrical prose style that stays with the reader after the novel is done. In this case, there's a fair degree of novelty even in Unsworth's chosen setting, taking us to the Norman Kingdom of Sicily in the 12th century, during the reign of King Roger II, the apex of the power of the House of Hauteville. This isn't a common setting for medieval historical fiction, and Unsworth milks every bit of interest he can out of this fascinating place, at the cultural juncture of western Europe, the Byzantine Empire, and the Islamic world.This novel was published in 2006, no doubt inspired by the burgeoning War on Terror, but its examination of sectarian conflict and the totalizing effect of ideology is every bit as pertinent a decade later, if not more so, given the recent rise of xenophobic nationalism and Islamophobia in much of western politics."}, {"userName": "Chahula", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3019948-chahula", "userReview": "A rare Could-Not-Finish.

Latin, Greek, Arab and Jew live together in precarious harmony in the city of Palermo. Due to the second crusade the opinion on the Muslims in Palermo has changed; they are seen more and more as a treat. The book is narrated by Thurstan Beauchamp, a Norman Christian who works for Yusuf, a Muslim Arab, in the palace\u2018s central finance office. The job includes the management of brides and blackmail and the gathering of secret information for the king. Thurstan, however also acts as the Purveyor of Pleasures and Shows. During one of his trips in Italy, Thurstan encounters a troupe of wandering dancers and musicians \u2013 among them the beautiful Nesrin \u2013 which he sends to Palermo to perform for the king. On this same journey Thurstan also encounters Alicia, the woman he loved as a youth and who has just returned from the holy land. Before he knows, Thurstan finds himself caught in a tangle of plots. This story at first is rather slow and confusing. After an hour however(I listened to the audio version) I was fully in the story and enjoying it. Despite loving history and reading, I\u2019m always a bit cautious when it comes to historical novels, especially when situated in the middle Ages. It mostly includes too much gruesome details of public executions or fights \u2013 but this certainly isn\u2019t the case in this fine novel. And the medieval setting can be a bit forced in some books, that this certainly isn\u2019t so with \u2018the Ruby in her Navel\u2019. In fact, as reader, you are transported back through time and yet, there is something very contemporary about this story and its plot. The themes are of course quite universal. It\u2019s a story about ambition, love, passion, mystery, betrayal and revenge, but also about racial, religious and political tensions that are still with us today. Definitely worth the effort as there are many twits and plots that keep you guessing till the end."}], "description": "Set in the Middle Ages during the brief yet glittering rule of the Norman kings, The Ruby in Her Navel is a tale in which the conflicts of the past portend the present. The novel opens in Palermo, in which Latin and Greek, Arab and Jew live together in precarious harmony. Thurstan Beauchamp, the Christian son of a Norman knight, works for Yusuf, a Muslim Arab, in the palace\u2019s central finance office, a job which includes the management of blackmail and bribes, and the gathering of secret information for the king. But the peace and prosperity of the kingdom is being threatened, internally as well as externally. Known for his loyalty but divided between the ideals of chivalry and the harsh political realities of his tumultuous times, Thurstan is dispatched to uncover the conspiracies brewing against his king. During his journeys, he encounters the woman he loved as a youth; and the renewed promise of her love, as well as the mysterious presence of an itinerant dancing girl, sends him on a spiritual odyssey that forces him to question the nature of his ambition and the folly of uncritical reverence for authority. With the exquisite prose and masterful narrative drive that have earned him widespread acclaim, Barry Unsworth transports the reader to a distant past filled with deception and mystery, and whose racial, tribal, and religious tensions are still with us today.", "title": "The Ruby in Her Navel", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4517.The_Ruby_in_Her_Navel", "average": 3.32, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1165444666l/4517.jpg", "reviews": 101, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3101.Barry_Unsworth", "name": "Barry Unsworth"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "Cultural", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4517.The_Ruby_in_Her_Navel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2106815.The_Ruby_In_Her_Navel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2106814.The_Ruby_In_Her_Navel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6434391-u-pupku-joj-rubin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2106816.The_Ruby_in_Her_Navel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10527573-a-dan-arina-do-ventre", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32381990-tane-nice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34626041-the-ruby-in-her-navel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8631010-the-ruby-in-her-navel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/239592.Sacred_Hunger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/883995.Morality_Play", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11076239-the-quality-of-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3952795-land-of-marvels", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114455.The_Songs_of_the_Kings"]}
