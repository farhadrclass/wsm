Alas, her short stories don\u2019t pack the same punch. True, some of them employ a similar combination of surreal plot and in-your-face ideology, but only four out of the 12 stories seemed to me strong enough to stand alone. These were \u201cLobster Dinner,\u201d surely inspired by David Foster Wallace\u2019s Consider the Lobster, in which crustaceans take revenge against their consumers; \u201cThe Dancing-Master,\u201d about a man who tries to introduce a nineteenth-century feral boy to culture only for wildness to come creeping back; \u201cI May Not Be the One You Want,\u201d in which Karen, writing a profile about a dairy farmer, avoids men\u2019s attempts to turn her into a sexual object; and \u201cFake Blood,\u201d another pseudo-horror story about a girl in a nurse costume who can\u2019t decide whether she\u2019s caught up in a murder mystery game or a real serial killer\u2019s trap.Of the rest, four or five \u2013 including vignettes from Karen\u2019s future life \u2013 are okay and a couple are pointless as well as seemingly endless (\u201cA Brief History of Weather\u201d and \u201cHylomorphosis\u201d). Students of feminist literature, especially fans of Angela Carter, may be willing to exchange satisfying storytelling for messages about women\u2019s bodies and anxiety about motherhood.Favorite passage:\nYou have beautiful eyes, he said all of a sudden.\nI hated compliments like that, compliments that carved out one particular part of your body and put it on a platter for viewing. It always took a while for me to reabsorb that body part afterward, to add it back to the whole. The best kind of compliment to give me was something vague, plausible. You\u2019re all right. Or, Don\u2019t worry, it gets better."}, {"userName": "Vincent Scarpa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5454934-vincent-scarpa", "userReview": "Interview forthcoming with Alexandra at Electric Literature, but for the time being: a fucking great collection by one of the most exciting voices in fiction.

I think Intimations is an inventive, unusual, eerie collection of \"stories,\" and probably deserves of a lot of praise for the technical aspects of the writing. But I can't say I enjoyed reading it or felt moved by it. I found myself searching the text for hidden meaning, lamenting not being a cooler, hipper, better reader.

If anything, Alexandra Kleeman has made her voice known. Whether by way of her absurdist debut novel or this collection of short stories, her POV is clear (if not a bit avant garde), even if her focus remains a bit slipshod. At its worst Intimations is muddled; there were several stories that barely stuck even moments after completing them. Yet at its best it's a revelation; \"You, Disappearing\" - the collection's final entry - best exemplifies this. It was an especially inspired take on loss that left me wanting more. Kleeman is an exciting and, well, different writer - one filled with promise and unpredictability, and one whom I'll continue to follow until my hope that one day she'll pull it all together and create something entirely extraordinary dries up."}, {"userName": "Samantha ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2060997-samantha", "userReview": "There are twelve short stories contained within Alexandra Kleeman's Intimations. There are three sections, which have four stories each. Of the twelve stories, I thought four within the whole work were great. A fifth I liked, and the rest I wasn't crazy about.Right off the bat, there are two stories I love: \"Fairy Tale\" and \"Lobster Dinner.\" These two are rich in symbolism and feature gorgeous, unsettling writing. They are surreal like nightmarish dreams. I wish the collection lived up to the promise of these first two stories. The next two stories in section I were not as good in my opinion. Then Section II was almost a total bust. There are three stories of realistic, contemporary fiction, all featuring a main character named Karen. At first I couldn't even tell if all the Karens are the same person (the stories do not appear chronologically: we go from single Karen in story one to married Karen in story two back to newly engaged Karen in story three). I don't think Kleeman excels in writing your standard realistic fiction. These three feel like a snooze. These stories are also all told in the third-person, and I think Kleeman is strongest when writing in the first-person, as she did in her debut novel You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine.But the final story in section II has Kleeman returning to form, delivering a dreamlike allegory called \"Intimation.\" The next story, which kicks off Section III, is \"Fake Blood,\" a nightmarish, humorous horror story that also features deeply intelligent symbolism. I did like the final story in the collection, \"You, Disappearing.\" Suffice it to say, I believe Kleeman is at her surreal best when she sticks to the style that suits her: absurdist sendups of life, especially modern sexual/romantic relationships. I wish the whole collection was told in this bizarre, whimsical style, with each story containing the caliber of storytelling that is present in my favorites. The rest of the stories range from unexciting to too disjointed and out there to make sense or have much impact. But even within the stories that I wasn't crazy about, there are great sentences. There are good ideas to be found. There is humor sprinkled throughout. Kleeman is a talented writer. And her prose is often beautifully, always thoughtfully, crafted. And even the Karen stories share themes with the ones that I love, themes such as motherhood, womanhood, and relationships. \"Fairy Tale,\" \"Lobster Dinner,\" \"Intimation,\" and \"Fake Blood\" are the stories that are the most like You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine. I hope in Kleeman's next work she continues with this unique type of literature that is all her own."}, {"userName": "Iris Bratton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47403956-iris-bratton", "userReview": "A unique reading experience that leaves you wanting more!I'm slowly starting to find Alexandra Kleeman as a new favorite author of mine the more she releases wonderful works. Her writing style is eerie yet beautiful and haunted me in a way that I never want to forget. Her stories are fantastical yet the themes seem so real. Kleeman provides intimations into life, death, and living. Although this is a short story collection, her stories read like poetry. They are so cryptic, I found myself wanting to read them over again to peel back the many layers within. Her imagery paints a vivid picture that is chilling yet gorgeous. Some stories were definitely more impacting than others. surprisingly the shorter ones had the most punch. Some of the longer ones were a little too simple or just plain strange. Fairy Tale, Intimations, and Rabbit Starvation were the most interesting to me. I have pages upon pages of notes about each one and I still feel like I haven't yet breached the surface of the meaning behind them. My only complaint is the inconsistency, especially when it pertains to quotations. Some stories have them and some don't. I understand that many of these were written at different times and omitting quotations may have been intentional for that particular story. But looking at the collection as a whole, it really bugged me.. Just choose one or the other, please. This collection is definitely not for everyone. Mainly because it's weird. There are somewhat graphic moments of violence, strange nightmares, and animal cruelty. If that's not what you enjoy reading then maybe perhaps find a different collection to read. If you enjoyed You Too Can Have A Body Like Mine, then you will most likely love this collection as I have come to love it. It's intricate and thought-provoking. I'll definitely be chewing on this one for a while."}, {"userName": "Marie-Therese", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1921165-marie-therese", "userReview": "Kleeman has a wonderful ability to turn a phrase, to craft an image, to describe a scene vividly but without excessive detail, but too many of the stories in this collection seem half-baked or baggy and shapeless. They're beautifully written but they lack punch. The best generally focus on the same themes of embodiment, hunger, and female identity that were so important in her excellent debut novel, You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine but she does occasionally branch out a bit here as in 'The Dancing Master', a rather formal, well-imagined vignette of quasi-historical fiction on the theme of the feral child and 'Hylomorphosis', a viscerally strange meditation on the nature of angels that manages to almost one-up the weirdness of late medieval theologians on the same subject.This is an interesting if not completely successful collection (I'm glad to have read it but realize others might find it slightly disappointing). Kleeman is a writer to watch out for in future-she's going places, and if she stumbles a bit on the journey, that doesn't make the destination less worthwhile."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31741337-alicia", "userReview": "These stories are so strange, so beautiful. Nothing makes sense and yet it's completely obvious how much it all does.

It's a collection of short stories, and the blurbs compare her to Pynchon and Delillo - which, maybe Pynchon, since he's so difficult to read. The stories are mostly nonsensical, like bad ideas in a early phase of being workshopped, and I chewed through them pretty quickly, more out of consternation than enjoyment. Bumped from one star to two for the last entry here, You, Disappearing - it's a story about a mysterious plague where all the things (including people) on Earth just start popping out of existence, it's the only thing here that even makes sense, much less has emotional resonance, but I enjoyed it.

So one of the reasons I persist with books I don\u2019t like is because, especially with newly published books, I want to stay current with what\u2019s out, develop opinions, think about the industry and the state of the art itself, and to keep informed and current. And sometimes I just want to know who I think is a trickster figure/con artist.This book is not like the awfullest book I have ever read, or even close. One or so of the stories is perfectly good, and throughout the writing is fine. But it\u2019s a book that basically keeps saying Look at Me, Look at Me, Look at Me\u2026\u2026LOOOK OVER THERE! ~~~POOF!~~~This book is audaciously boring and bland. It\u2019s trying so hard to be something and to be something I dunno\u2026.not like avant garde\u2026.but tricksy or something like that. But the result is that most of the stories are boring or don\u2019t amount to much, and the little playful ones are basically throwaway.The one story I thought was pretty good involved an awkward would-be hookup with a German film enthusiast. And like I said it was fine.But if your collection has lot of different stories and more than half are forgettable and one is decent\u2026that doesn\u2019t bode well. I think the stories here seem to have been run through the filter of other writers I also don\u2019t like that much\u2026or again, are fine, but are not my favorite, and the resulting mass is both less good than those writers, derivative, and annoying. And they\u2019re annoying in part because they take up marketplace space and people who I don\u2019t trust as promoters are promoting them. So anyway, those other writers are George Saunders (a little), Adam Johnson (a little more), and Lydia Davis (a lot more \u2014 but I actually like her work)."}, {"userName": "Mary DeMay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42931981-mary-demay", "userReview": "Intimations: Stories is dreamy women's lit. It is a surreal piece that is somehow completely relatable. I really enjoyed this strange set of stories. These stories are about being human and attempting to meet expectations set forth by family, friends, spouses, and society as a whole. My favorite story of the collection was \"Disappearing, You,\" about the 'disoappocalypse.\" The end-times consist of a gradual disappearance of things from existence, and the narrator must cope with her loneliness in a world where nothing is guaranteed. Kleeman has a knack for capturing the absurdity of what is ordinarily the mundane, rendering her readers breathless by a story's end. She is my favorite kind of writer, reminiscent of Shirley Jackson, Sylvia Plath, and Don DeLilo. She has a fresh, philosophical voice that is not pretentious at all.

The themes careen around and mix together - relationship failures, sickening food paranoia, trying to control the uncontrollable, and transformation- in interesting ways. The writing, in the more plot-based stories (\"Fairy Tale\", \"Choking Victim\", \"Fake Blood\", and \"You, Disappearing\" being my favorites) is both melancholy and funny, and always just off-kilter enough that the world takes on a sort of otherness that I think is useful in thinking about the weirdnesses of the real one. The more experimental stories tend to be kind of sickening. Both \"Lobster Dinner\" and \"Rabbit Starvation\" (and I guess, to a lesser degree even \" Hylomorphosis\") all describe frankly horrific, surreal patterns of eating and being eaten that are dazzling to read, if not incredibly pleasant. Overall, a great collection and, while I like Kleeman's full novel somewhat more, a solid second book."}], "description": "From the celebrated author of You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine,a thought-provoking, often unsettling story collection that consists, broadly, of narrative diagrams of the three main stages in a human life: birth, life, and death.Alexandra Kleeman\u2019s debut novel You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine earned her comparisons to Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, Ben Marcus, and Tom Perrotta. It was praised by the New York Times as \"a powerful allegory of our civilization\u2019s many maladies, artfully and elegantly articulated, by one of the young wise women of our generation.\"In her second book, a collection of twelve stories irresistibly seductive in their strangeness, she explores human life from beginning to end: the distress of birth into a world already formed; the brief and confusing period of \"living\" where we understand what is expected of us and struggle to do it; and the death-y period toward the end where we sense it is ending and will end only partially understood, at best.The title is taken from one of the stories (\"Intimation\"), but is also a play on Wordsworth's \"Intimations of Immortality\"\u2014only in this case it\u2019s not clear exactly what is being intimated, but it\u2019s nothing so gleaming and good as Immortality. The middle, \"Living\" section of the book, is fleshed out with a set of stories that borrow more from traditional realist fiction to illustrate the inner lives of the characters.At once familiar and mysterious, these stories have an eerie resonance as its characters find themselves in new and surprising situations. An unnamed woman enters a room with no exit and a ready-made life; the disappearance of people, objects, and memory creates an apocalypse; the art of dance is used to try to tame a feral child; the key to surviving a house-party lies in knowing the difference between fake and real blood.Elegant, surprising, wondrous, and haunting, Intimations is an utterly transporting collection from one of our most ingenious and brilliant young writers.", "title": "Intimations: Stories", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257667-intimations", "average": 3.57, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1457039195l/28257667.jpg", "reviews": 49, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9788932.Alexandra_Kleeman", "name": "Alexandra Kleeman"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257667-intimations", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29411922-intimations", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28259070-intimations", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33545292-intimations", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23461003-you-too-can-have-a-body-like-mine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29997478-choking-victim", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26132661-disappearing-dad-disorder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28926405-fake-blood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39171715-you-disappearing"]}
