It has a twist. Fun to read and imagine what kind of care a dogosaurus would require if you owned one. Every dog breed has their quirks so you really need to know how to handle those quirks and find the positive part of the breed and go with that.Written by Anna Staniszewski, illustrated by Kevin Hawkes and published by Henry Holt & Company.#mustlovedogs #dinosaurs #mustread #humor"}, {"userName": "Baby Bookworm", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58232346-baby-bookworm", "userReview": "This review was originally written for The Baby Bookworm. Visit us for new picture books reviews daily!Hello, friends! Today\u2019s review is Dogosaurus Rex, written by Anna Staniszewski and illustrated by Kevin Hawkes, a charming and sweet story of the special friendship between a boy and his\u2026 er\u2026 \u201cdog.\u201dToday\u2019s the day that Ben gets a dog of his very own! His mom brings him to the shelter, and while there are many wonderful dogs that need homes, none of them feel like the right fit. That is until Ben sees the biggest cage of all \u2013 and Sadie. Sadie is much bigger than the other dogs, with scalier skin and much pointier teeth, but Ben knows that she\u2019s the dog for him. He adopts her and brings her home, but having such a large \u201cdog\u201d proves to be difficult at first. Sadie eats everything in the house, she can drink up a whole pond in one sitting, her tricks tend to smash cars, and when she does her business, well\u2026 there\u2019s a lot of it. Ben\u2019s mom is concerned that they may not be able to keep Sadie, and everyone in town is beginning to turn against her. Ben will have to find a way to prove to everyone else what he already knows: that Sadie is the best dog in the world.This was adorable. I loved so many things about it: that Sadie was a girl dinosaur, that she was consistently and hilariously referred to as a dog, the wonderfully fun resolution, and especially that Ben never lost faith in his pet. It shows children that pets are a commitment, and that it\u2019s the responsibility of their owners to make sure they are trained and well-behaved. The illustrations are wonderful, filled with sweetness, excitement, and a dogosaurus so lovable it made us want one of our own. JJ adored this as well, especially when Sadie would roar instead of barking. This one is a delight for dino-lovers, and it\u2019s Baby Bookworm approved!Be sure to check out The Baby Bookworm for more reviews!"}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1222379-barbara", "userReview": "With illustrations created with sepia-toned pencil, watercolor, and acrylic washes, this picture book tells the story of the love between a boy and his dog. Of course, the title gives everything away since that dog is actually a dinosaur with whom Ben, the boy, fell in love when he visited the animal shelter. It's love at first sight, and even though Sadie is much larger than Ben's mother expected and has an odd bark, they take her home. Sadie causes all sorts of problems since even bathing her results in a drained lake when she drinks up all the water. And cleaning up after her once she has gone to the bathroom is a Herculean chore. Just when it looks as though Sadie's days in Ben's home may be numbered because of all the trouble she's causing, she proves her worth. This one might be fun to share with youngsters when they need a big laugh since it is clearly a whale of a tale, given to much exaggeration, imagination, and absurdity. Still, the notion of a dinosaur as a pet is fun to ponder."}, {"userName": "Cindy Mitchell *Kiss the Book*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19521241-cindy-mitchell-kiss-the-book", "userReview": "Staniszewski, Anna Dogosaurus Rex, illustrated by Kevin Hawkes. PICTURE BOOK. Henry Holt (Macmillan), 2017. $18. 9780805097061Ben is excited to adopt a dog. When his mom takes him to the shelter to find a dog, he comes home with a huge one that looks like a cross between a T-rex and a collie. At first, Ben\u2019s dog gets him into trouble because he\u2019s so big and smashes things and fetches mail trucks. But when a thief tries to get away, dogosaurus comes to the rescue!

My children worked really hard at playing together nicely today, and as a treat I rewarded them with this book. My son said he really liked the part where the boy built a doghouse for Sadie, and she was a dinosaur, not a dog! My daughter said she would give the book a hundred stars and she really liked the part where Sadie drank the entire lake. Overall, my kids loved the book, and I enjoyed how it teaches kids to look beyond appearances alone, and that love can be found when you look in the right places. Thanks for bringing this fun story to the world Anna.

The T-rex is unruly but sweet. Everyone around town is annoyed by some of its antics, but accept the T-rex when she helps catch a robber. It's Clifford but as a T-rex. I mean the only thing different about this pet is that she's huge. She doesn't do anything T-rexi except \"roar\". And the mom doesn't know what a dinosaur looks like? Hello, Jurassic Park. But I guess if your in a world where you can take a T-rex home and it acts like a huge ass dog then your world is pretty wonky. I think I might be reading to much into a book meant for 5 year olds.

Sadie doesn't quite fit in but Ben loves his \"best dog ever\" anyway. However, others are not as impressed with Sadie's greatness and want her to go away ... that is UNTIL she catches a thief. I think the lesson of this book is supposed to be that what makes someone different can be a strength, but it honestly came across as \"being different is bad unless your differences can be capitalized on\" or \"most people only care for you if you can do something for them\" neither of which are things I want to be teaching young minds."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134326-barbara", "userReview": "Ben and his mom go to the animal shelter to find the perfect pet and Ben finds the best one ever, a dinosaur!
