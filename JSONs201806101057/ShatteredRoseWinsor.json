So I was in the mood for some Christian romance and the previous books that I read on that genre were like really boring and preachy, but I can successfully say, that this book is nothing like that. Though it didn't really inform me much about the religion of Christianity, it did tell that the religion is simply about love and peace.There seems to be so much hate on religion and God lately and in many YA books. From the books I've read, the church is always evil and tries to force everyone to follow God and blah blah blah. Just because a certain group of people go out and do something bad using religion as an excuse does not mean all the people that follow that certain religion are evil and have to be looked down upon. This goes for all religions and beliefs. This book isn't really informative on teachings of Christianity, except for the obvious, which is believing in Jesus Christ and saving yourself for marriage. However, in the beginning of every chapter there was a prayer said, which I'm assuming Parker says (since he's the Christian guy.)\u201cLord, we all fall and make mistakes. I pray she turns to You during those moments and knows that You are her wonderful counselor and prince of peace\u2026\u201dThe best thing about this book is that it isn't being preachy about Christianity. It simply shows how God loves his creations and peace and love is always the way to go. It's trying to show that Christianity isn't a religion about hate. This book is much more than just religion. It's also about a girl struggling with her body and an eating disorder and a painfully annoying love triangle. le sigh. \"In the end, I had thrown up five times. Five times I had intentionally wrecked my body. Stuffing it to the point of capacity and then forcing myself to vomit.\"\"My eyes zeroed in on the scale. I shouldn\u2019t get on. It would only depress me. But I did anyway and saw I had gained a pound. My throat tightened, constricting my air flow. How is that possible? I just weighed two days ago! Tears sprang to my eyes. I knew temptation was coming, and panicked sweat slid down my face. I wanted to escape; I wanted to get this weight off of me. I wanted to disappear. I got on the scale again\u2014sure I had read it wrong the first time. I hadn\u2019t.\"\"I had sat down for two Thanksgiving dinners and was leaving hungrier than before either of them.

I recognize so many people in the pages of the book, so many real faces that are caught up in the destructive cycle Avery faces. In this way, the book becomes not only a great read that draws you in and makes you want to yell at the characters to make certain decisions, but it also becomes a beacon of hope to those desperately lost in a long dark tunnel that twists and turns and winds back around to where it started. The descriptions of Avery's thoughts and reasoning as she battles her eating disorder and obsessive relationship give us a raw look at the labyrinth she's running through. Every choice is a crossroads, and rooting for her to take the right path is unavoidable. She's the girl-next-door who needs someone to believe in her, someone to throw her a lifeline and introduce her to the One Person who can clear up her confusion by grabbing her hand and walking her out of the dark maze. But will she open up to that possibility or continue down the self-destructive path that seems so much easier to take?Anyone who works with girls or young women should read this book, not only to gain sensitivity to that girl everyone knows who just won't stop making bad choices, but also to be reminded of the difference simply reaching out and showing unconditional love can make in someone's life. I found this book enthralling, and I loved the author's style. I look forward to reading the second book in this series, which seems to spin off of one of the minor characters. Keep 'em coming, Mrs. Gray! You've gained a fan!PARENTAL RATING: I'd like to give this a strong PG-13, but I need to emphasize that the G does stand for guidance--you moms and aunts will want to read this one first. It's brutally honest about the reality of eating disorders and obsession, with some spicy details about how far sexual attraction can go. The author didn't cross any lines in terms of the details, but use your judgment about whether or not it's too much for your teen. **I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.(More complete review posted at hammocklibrarian.blogspot.com)"}, {"userName": "Kathy Locke", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20556125-kathy-locke", "userReview": "Couldn't put it down! Thought I'd read one chapter before bed and now it is 4:30am! I love the hope and struggle to find the hope! I loved the redemption of Christ and His unconditional love portrayed through Parker. I found myself encouraged and reminded of that unconditional love that I think most people struggle to grasp at some point in their life. What a realistic, beautiful portrayal of the perfectionistic performance mindset, the breakdown in meeting those performance standards and fidning the solution. I love the message of facing the fears of not being perfect and finding a love that is solid, stable, strong and true! Excellent story line!I rated this less than a 5 star only for a few grammar issues (missing words to complete the sentence) and some misspellings (Ex: siting for sitting). Otherwise top notch dialogue, plot, and character development! Can't read to read Issy's and Jake's stories; as well as reading Parker's perspective!"}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11909124-staci", "userReview": "This new adult novel is Tammy Gray's debut. In Shattered Rose, there are four main characters and they are all college students at Winsor. The vast majority of the novel focuses on Avery, her roommate Issy and Issy's cousin Jake. None of them are Christians and each is still finding their moral compass.What I liked most is when it was revealed who the voice was behind the prayers that started each chapter. The writing is good.Readers looking for squeaky clean novels may want to pass on this debut. Although filled with fallen characters, they each came across as realistic and in need of someone to shine the light of Jesus."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25650573-ashley", "userReview": "Honestly, this book really hit home for me. I was raised in a Christian home and suffered from an eating disorder. I've had many counselors and struggled a lot through my high school life fighting to be what everyone else saw as perfect. It took me too long to realize that I'm love for who I am. I'm how happily married to a man who loves me no matter what I weigh and I have a beautiful baby girl. This book is one of so few that shine into the darkness of eating disorders and the struggles girls go through to be seen as perfect. I really enjoyed this book :) great read!

And this book was over 400 pages long. It came in the mail today and I opened it and said to myself that I'd just read a few pages. Well I just finished and it was so good it is making my favorite fiction list. I started to get choked up a number of times when Avery thought about how much she hated herself and yet God sent someone into her life to show her His unconditional love for her. It was beautiful.The crazy relationship with Jake made sense too. In fact, he reminded me of my ex and in a frighteningly similar fashion. I couldn't tell you how many times I'd seen women go for the bad boys when the good guy was right in front of them. Avery's confusion was genuine and I remembered feeling the same way back when I was the same age and dealt with the same eating disorder, though I dealt with it differently and it wasn't as severe. The coolest thing of all was when I found my savior and that happened for me in a very similar fashion as it happened to Avery. That gave me goosebumps as I remembered my brokenness that day.Anyway, it was also a powerful love story and very realistic. I can't remember the last time I was so emotionally gripped by a story and when I cared about the characters so much that I ached for them. Avery's journey was so deep and so complex, but I loved reading it because it also rang so true.For anyone who has ever been plagued with self-loathing, felt unworthy, picked men who made their insecurities worse, and dealt with addictive behavior - this book is for you. It shows how faith in Jesus is the only true answer and does so in a compelling and honest fashion. I'm so glad I took the time to read this book - not that I could stop once I started it. I just wish it was autographed. Oh well."}, {"userName": "Jamie Rhodes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16446218-jamie-rhodes", "userReview": "Sometimes there are books whose words you just don't want to stop reading. I didn't want to do anything but keep reading to see where this book was going next. I was gripped by this book. This is a love triangle book (or to me it is). In one corner we have Avery. Avery is fighting self loathing issues. She has a problem with eating and purging. This is a central theme throughout the book. She keeps this a secret from everyone. In another corner we have Jake. Jake is your typical bad boy who has commitment issues due to past family problems. Jake is NOT my favorite character. The way that he treats Avery is actually unbearable to me. In the last corner of this triangle we have Parker. Parker is a pre-med student who is going to go into the armed forces. He is a Christian. He is sweet and loves Avery with everything that he has. Avery has a roommate, Issy. Issy and Jake are cousins so Jake s around all of the time. I think the friendship of Issy, Jake, and Avery is one that is not healthy. Avery can't seem to say no to these people. Issy and Jake seem to want to party and go out all of the time. Avery doesn't need that in her life. She ends up doing as lots of young college students do and being put on academic probation. Needless to say her life is spiraling out of control. Parker and Jake are like daylight and dark, chaos, and peace. I have to say that Avery got on my ever loving nerves. I know she has issues, but she had a best friend that tried to help her. So who will she choose? Will it be bad boy Jake who consumes her every thought or Parker who does everything that he can to help her see that she is worthy? No cliffhanger. We only get Avery's point of view. This has a Christian feel to it as each chapter begins with a prayer for Avery. There are issues in this book which include: drinking and pre-marital sex. The book doesn't have sex scenes, but it is implied. I would recommend this book to teenagers who may have some body issue trouble. I notice that there are more books in this series, but this one can be read as a stand alone."}, {"userName": "Salyna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10530894-salyna", "userReview": "This book was a very good read and I enjoyed it a lot. However, even though it is Christian and has a good ending it was a very emotional read. It also had a ton of adult content. I would not recommend this book to anybody under age 17, but that's my opinion. Some reasons I say this are because their is: sex before marriage, underage drinking, partying, and an eating disorder in the book. It used the word \"Hell\" in the book as a swear word a few times which might also bother some people. I'm not trying to make it so you don't want to read the book, because it was good, I'm putting this in here for warning that way you know what you are about to read if you decide to read it. This book doesn't sugar coat.When those things that I listed above took place in the book Avery never really felt guilty when she was doing it, but after she felt completely horrible and worthless. She would also feel like she didn't deserve anyone's love. Through the book she realizes that she may not be worth God's love, but that he is willing to give it freely anyway if she lets him.I'm not going to say anything about the guys, Jake and Parker, in the book because I do not want to give away which one she ends up with;)Shattered Rose is told in first person which I liked a lot, because when I read the 'I did's or the 'I felt's I really did feel like I was going through her struggles/feeling her every emotion which was very important for the story in this case. I needed to feel these emotions so I knew what it would feel like for these things to actually happen to me. That way if I am ever put in some of Avery's situations I will not be tempted because I know the consequences of what could happen. If that makes any sense.In my opinion this is a subtle Christian book. One that Christians and Non-Christians alike can appreciate.This book was a self-published book, I received it in trade for a written blog review.

It showed almost every emotion to us as a reader and it made us feel exactly what the character felt and just as a reader I know that's amazing that a writer can get it so right. I loved this story it had so many hidden and out there messages within in and well it made it so deep, I thought the length of it would bother me and it did because it wasn't long enough!Jake well what can I say, I liked him at first but as the book went on I realised how much I detested him not just because of what he did but how he acted towards all women like we were disposable it was annoying frustrating and kind of made me want to hurt him lol.Avery well she was naive, sweet at first and seemed almost like a child going to college, she made mistakes, felt heartbreak and even found love, true unconditional love and it was lovely to see her almost blossom in front of us through her journey I loved it.Parker was a proper cute sweet gentle boy with so much love for life and belief in people it was amazing to see in a character and like it was shown within the story he's a rarity and it was lovely to see the way he treated Avery and believed in her even when she had no belief in herself. He have her a strength that she didn't have before and that was charming.Overall I liked the book, the twists and turns, love hate and heartbreak is amazingly written about.

Jake was the roommates cousin and he had issues but was drawn to Avery, although he didn't want to be. He really controlled her emotions and then dropped her.

None of the main characters are hollowed creatures with no sense of substance. Each character starting from Avery to Issy are all facing different trials and temptations in life\u2014some hidden and some apparent. T.L. Gray presents the characters in a believable way, helping the readers to see that there are people in life who endure things that these characters did. T.L. portrays the unconditional love of God through one of the characters and it just shows how we as followers of God can love others without being judgmental and condemning. One lesson that T.L showed in her writing that really stood out to me is not to be unequally yoked with another. You and that person cannot move forward in a growing relationship if you two aren\u2019t pursuing the same thing (God).Shattered Rose is a heartfelt story that at times will make you laugh, highly angry at Avery and Jake sometimes, and cry around chapter 24.

This novel was way more than I expected. A coming of age story, with some real depth to it. Gray tackles some hard hitting issues, like eating disorders, the lies we believe, the choices we make, unhealthy relationships and more. However, this novel has a beautiful thread of love, hope, redemption and grace woven in. You don't see it at first, and honestly the beginning, while interesting wasn't as gripping as the rest of the novel. Still it was hard to put down, it was honest, fresh and felt all too real. There were times I wanted to shake some sense into our main character but in truth, although we may not struggle with her exact issues, we all have issues we struggle with and can relate. We can relate to our weakness and look to the hope of more; redemption. I do not want to give too much away...but I have to say that I love the way Parker and his love paint such a portrait of Christ... You can't help but to root for him. This novel finishes strong!
