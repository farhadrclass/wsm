In Mark Flemings story Eleanor is a siren and to anyone's knowledge is the last of her kind. Her talents are too good to be passed up and so Eleanor's power of persuasion in put to work. \"Sirens. Mysterious disappearances. Beautiful women taking lonely travellers into dark pools where they vanish without a trace. They beguile and tempt. They reach into your heart and find your secrets.\"Eleanor is used to inflitrate and lure secrets out of people. As the blurb states and the book details a bit further, Eleanor is the perfect killer. But the Siren only wants what most beings want. Instead she gets caught between all the bureaucracy and competitive agencies. It looks like Eleanor has tangled with the wrong person though. The author gets kudos for coming up with something original. The Siren is an ancient myth but she is transplanted in a modern world with modern issues. Someone like Eleanor could be quite a useful tool for a great many diabolical reasons. The character of Eleanor is a fascinating one. Her memories only last for a certain amount of time and she is used in one scenario after another. She is also a sad character that wants love and is only looked at for her irresistable looks and her ability to sway men and for what she can accomplish for both good and bad reasons. The adventures are tense and suspenseful but not cohesive. It was almost like we were reading a new story about Eleanor every few chapters and they often felt disconnected somehow. The writing is lush and it's obvious the author has talent , but sometimes things were hammered on a few too many times and the prose took a little adjusting to. It was a surprise to discover this book is a part of a trilogy. So, before you start this one be aware you will have to continue on with the next book to get the whole picture. This is an interesting read that mingles fantasy with adventure and suspense . The book has a dark tone and deep character development and is a stylish concept. For those looking for something unique and challenging for the brain instead of the same old, then I do recommend you give this one a try. This one gets 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Adrienne Woods", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7344695-adrienne-woods", "userReview": "I Love it when a story hooks me like this from the first page. Mark Flemming gave me a copy for my honest review and this has an interesting premise, well developed, and beautiful characters. His descriptions were wonderful and I got completely lost in the pages, just like a book should do.Eleanor,a Siren and the Main Character, is so strong, yet she has weakness to find love, and feeling trapped, like most humans do. It is a fictional character out of this world but one we can all relate to. The plot takes you on a roller coaster ride, the kind you really enjoy, and there were really emotional parts in this book, that I just can't put into words. Mark Flemming did an amazing job. It's one novel that I couldn't predict the end.I've been around the world myself and the way Mark is taking his readers around the world with The Call of The Siren, was done beautiful. I could see the Lake's of England, the beaches of Tailand and a place I really want to go, Rome. Mark definitely gave me an idea what I'm going to expect and I fell in love with his writing style, it's a beautiful crafted story, and one I recommend to everyone. You need to read the story. I promise you won't be disappointed.It's a novel I would recommend to all of my friends.Review will be on my blog the 22 November http://woodsadrienne.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Benjamin Gorman", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22915587-benjamin-gorman", "userReview": "This mixture of an espionage thriller and a contemporary fantasy story felt like something John LeCarre might have produced if he\u2019d been tasked with creating something similar to Twilight. Unlike that disappointing, over-hyped vampire story, Mark Fleming aims for something more LeCarre-esque when he sets his novel in a world of competing clandestine organizations, corrupt oligarchs, greedy NGOs, and cynical bureaucrats. This ratchets-up the stakes to a degree that is both exciting and believable. At the same time, he gives us a heroine who is just as mythological as any vampire, a siren, but also a woman who is complex, tortured, and powerful in a way that avoids Twilight\u2019s teenage girl\u2019s anti-feminist sexual experience/marriage/instant domesticity fantasy. In short, The Call of the Siren offers the escapist fun of Twilight without the icky sense that you\u2019re contributing to regressive sexual politics.The beach-read vacation is part of the romance.Beginning in England\u2019s Lake District (where one might expect to find a creature who likes to hide out in freshwater pools), The Call of the Siren whisks the reader off on a tour of London, rural France, the beaches of Thailand, the side streets of Rome, and back to England. I felt like I\u2019d enjoyed some good passport stamping, but I never felt dislocated or jet-lagged by the plot.The main character, Eleanor (who must go by a few aliases due to her profession), merges a well-conceived mythological character with a complex human\u2019s psychology. For example, while the mythology provides her with some Achilles heels (electricity, fast moving water, the ocean, a limited memory), she also has her own human weaknesses (a need to find love and a sense that she is trapped which is so strong it makes her nearly suicidal). Conversely, just as the mythology gives her strengths (near-invulnerability, super-strength, accelerated reflexes, the ability to turn into a liquid to escape), her humanity gives her strengths, too (compassion, charisma, and humor). One of her more interesting characteristics is a variation on the pathology of cutting; with her superhuman abilities, cutting wouldn\u2019t do her any good (i.e. harm), so she uses electricity in the same way a cutter uses bloodletting to deal with psychological pain. I found that both clever and insightful.I won\u2019t give away any of the plot, but there were twists that caught me off guard, a few of them genuinely heart-wrenching. The pacing at the beginning of the book (after the very exciting first few chapters) slows in a way that matches Eleanor\u2019s undercover persona, and there were times when that work of gaining trust moved a bit unhurriedly for my taste, but this allowed Fleming to hit the throttle at the end (spoiler: someone literally hits the throttle), zipping through the climax with satisfying speed.Though the book could probably benefit from a fine-tooth combing by a schoolmarm grammarian with an eye for the occasional missed comma, over-all it\u2019s very readable. Fleming lets his prose get a bit purple from time to time, but I was impressed by his ability to write about seduction without being graphic or tepid. That\u2019s a difficult needle to thread, and he manages to do it frequently in a story that hinges on Eleanor\u2019s ability to entice men to their untimely but enjoyable ends.I don\u2019t want to reveal if the story\u2019s ending is simply happy or complicated and end-of-Old Yeller-heartbreaking (hint: nothing about Eleanor\u2019s life is simple), but it\u2019s important that I make it clear that the ending is satisfying. There\u2019s a window open for a sequel, but the reader isn\u2019t left feeling short-changed. Still, if Eleanor were to trickle through that open window and ask me to follow her down to a nearby stagnant pool for a little dip in a Part II, I would certainly follow her."}, {"userName": "Paul Martin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19818912-paul-martin", "userReview": "It\u2019s a pity other reviewers have made clich\u00e9s of words such as chilling, thriller, and page-turner, for Mark Fleming\u2019s The Call of the Siren certainly deserves those epithets. It is a well paced, well written, novel with beautifully narrated settings that key your senses, and realistic action that will keep your E-reader running hot.The characters, including Eleanor the Siren, come alive with unique emotions and individual attributes that bring them to life on the pages. In Eleanor, Mr. Fleming has a storyline with limitless possibilities; for how can we know what a siren will do next?Negatively, I found only three things that disrupted my flight of fantasy: Mr. Fleming has been suckered into the myth that a twelve volt auto battery can produce a shock. I also had trouble visualizing how the heroine could \u2018melt\u2019 into the ground near the ocean and rematerialize, I presume, miles away in a pond. My last objection is definitely a personal preference. I didn\u2019t notice the novel was the first in a series and was greatly disappointed with the ending. At over 111,000 words I was expecting an end, a climax. There was a climax, but it was on me when I read \u201cEleanor will return:\u201dIn conclusion; if you read for the love of reading and enjoy following the exploits of a favorite character then you should consider Eleanor the siren for your next journey.**** 4 StarsDOYLE"}, {"userName": "Aaron Safronoff", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5710650-aaron-safronoff", "userReview": "The Call of the Siren is good story that gets lost in superfluous descriptions, and unnecessarily repeated character definitions.There are numerous tangential, often pseudo-poetic, descriptions of objects and events throughout the work. A disappointingly few serve to deepen the reader's understanding of the environment, or connect him or her more strongly to the plot or characters. But there's a ton of potential. The author clearly has all of the tools as a capable writer, and imaginative story-teller, but needs help to focus his talents. In other words, it feels like the feedback loop was broken, and the author was left guessing as to how much, when, and where to elaborate.Finally, a dark social commentary is expressed throughout the book about the nature of relationships. The Siren character breaks some conventions of course, but for the most part, no one--including the Siren--expresses interest in anything other than wealth or beauty."}], "description": "She is the Siren.
