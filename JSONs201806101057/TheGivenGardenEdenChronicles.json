There is evil in the sweetest dreams, selfishness in the purest of good deeds and in the end, only those who can meet their eyes in the mirror and like what's shining from within our eyes, can claim strength- whether that light be angelic, or a wicked gleam.I think I got there for me, I hope I touch others- and if not well, I pray that it's at least an interesting story ;)"}, {"userName": "Hanna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35261695-hanna", "userReview": "4.5 starsWhy on earth is everyone reading The Selection and not this? When I found \"The Given Garden\" on Amazon for free I did not expect much. I'd read so many dystopian books these last few years and only very few have been able to wow me. Mostly, they did not feel real. I had the feeling that most aspiring dystopia writers purchase the same set of building blocks, build something and present it as ground-breaking. Very seldom is there a feeling of uniqueness, of realness, to these books. You have been thinking the same thing? Then read \"The Given Garden\" if you want something real.Larkin is a Given, a third born child expected to serve her kingdom from her fifth to her twentyfirst birthday. Normally the Given children work as Blue Collars, but since Larking turns five the same year as the prince Kohen, the rules are slightly different for her. Kohen is asked to pick a few girls to be his companions for the years to come and Larkin surprisingly makes it by being her boyish, bold self. She and the prince get close through the years until their friendship and Larkin's future are endangered when the true purpose of her and the other girls being in the castle is revealed on their thirteenth birthday...So, why is this better than \"The Selection\"?1) Larkin. How awesome can a heroine be - Larkin certainly makes my top ten. She's just perfectly written. Human, interesting, funny and worth following. I was rooting for her the whole way through. America, you can pack your things and cry in private at home instead of on my bookshelf.2) The world building. This is finally an example where dystopian kingdoms works. I wouldn't have thought they ever would but I'm happy to have been mistaken. Very seldom have I read about a future this well-thought-of.3) There's actually a plot! And not just some plot, no, this story draws you in more and more the further it progresses. And there's no relief at the end of book 1. Only the urge to get a copy of The Forbidden Fruit.4) Basically everything else. The characters, the dialogue, the things that happen, you name it. This book should have had a much bigger budget than \"The Selection\". By far.So, where did the half star go?To quite some editing that I would do. Long stretches of the book where descriptions of the kingdoms, the customs, the history of the world,... I would much rather put them in an appendix. The exact climate in Rachiel isn't something I necessarily want to hear about. In some parts it showed too much just how much the author thought about this world of hers. Also some explanations came a bit late, like how the seasons now started and ended in different months (this is a very confusing and maybe not that necessary property anyway). Then there was the legend - or might I say historic account - about the creation of the world and how the constant battle of bad and good had come about which the book started with and which intersected it as well. Though it is a crucial part of the book it still seemed unpolished in places and confusing in terms of when in time we're supposed to find ourselves and all in all I would have simplified and shortened this part a lot. There were so many pages of legend and explanation that Larkin's story was paused for pages on end and quite some of the reading flow was lost. But read this anyway, if you want to do something wortwhile with your time. Best book I read in months."}, {"userName": "Emm Cole", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12110334-emm-cole", "userReview": "**I received an early copy of this story as a beta reader, in exchange for my feedback and honest review.**Larkin is only five when she is ripped from her mother and taken in by the royal Barachiels at the palace. She doesn't know why, other than the fact that she is third born in her family. Each family is only allowed two children in a post-apocalyptic world that's doing its best to rebuild. Poor Larkin has been given in a way, back to her country to fill a debt and play whatever role her country has in mind.At first it isn't so bad, because she's found a strong and unquestionable friendship with Prince Kohen. And even though she is given very limited control over her own future, she has the comforts and safety of the palace, and the luxuries most could only be envious over.But Larkin is too much of her own person to just accept things as they are. As she grows from a vulnerable and scared little girl, into a smart and independent young woman, she's beginning to see the game that's being played behind the scenes. Not only do I love the back and forth of Larkin's building relationship with Kohen and Kohl, but this is S.K. Munt's most visual and creative work to date. I've always had such a love for Greek mythology, and the amount of effort and detail put into the framework of the apocalypse, angels, and Satan is to be admired. I could see her in every scene, (yes Satan is a woman), and her role may just break your heart. It did mine. The Given Garden is vibrant and brave not just in its interpretation of creation and theology, but also in its characters and their intentions. The romantic entanglements are just messy enough to keep you guessing which Barachiel brother Larkin should really trust herself to swoon over. I have an early favorite, but nothing is certain chapter to chapter. I was certainly kept on my toes.It's far from a secret that I think S.K. Munt could tell a good story in her sleep, and I count myself quite lucky that I had the opportunity to beta read The Given Garden. Just try to read this without needing more of this original world immediately."}, {"userName": "Sassapphras", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4201770-sassapphras", "userReview": "[I abhor cheating, and I cannot love a hero who cheats on his heroine (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6589908-jen", "userReview": "The Given garden by S.K Munt is more than just a story. It has the ability to change your mood and evoke emotions you never knew you had. I was giggling like a school girl in love at one minute, pondering our very existence and questioning all I've been taught about our creation the next and then I would be taken over by this murderous rage! I wanted to track down the author and inflict pain on her whilst patting her lovingly at the same time. This world Munt has created is unique and so incredibly vivid. The biblical history is not at all boring but a gripping story in itself with its own equally loveable and despicable characters. I can't wait to see how the story of these original players influence the next book. Team Kohl all the way!"}, {"userName": "Cheryl Duval", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23380336-cheryl-duval", "userReview": "This story is beyond extraordinary. It's a remarkable, unique and fascinating fantasy that displays an unbelievable imagination on the part of the author. The detail is stunning and the beliefs of the characters are unusual and inconceivable. The religious doctrine and regulation in the world that was created by the author is strikingly thought out and immensely intriguing. The story has appealing characters and a gripping story. I am anxiously awaiting the next installment. I highly recommend The Given Garden. This is an excellent book."}, {"userName": "mara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19328776-mara", "userReview": "Actual rating 3.5, I really do wish Goodreads allowed us to give half stars I was so conflicted with this one. S.K Munt is without a doubt one of my favourite authors she always brings something completely new to the table, no two books of hers follow the same boring formula that has become common in adult books. I don't think I've ever read a dystopian novel quite like The Given Garden, it was well structured, extremely detailed and completely original. The characters were complex, and we didn't get a time leap of 11 years instead we watched these characters grow over time. Although I loved this book, the characters and the entire concept the only drawback for me was the huge amounts of information that was repeated throughout. I know this was done for us to understand this dystopian society and add to the world building, but I found myself zoning out at certain parts. I was far more invested in the actual characters Larkin, Khol and Karol their scenes and interactions with the other characters for me was more interesting than the creation story (which I understand is vital to the plot - although it could have been trimmed down)or the structure of society. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book its a solid start to the series, and I cant wait to see what's next for these characters."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14432741-valerie", "userReview": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 +1 Too good to put down. I stayed up all night reading this and going to buy the next book in the series IMMEDIATELY!I cried when my E-reader read \"100%\" completed. The Hell I was... I was so not done with finding out what happens in this world of beautifully created characters and the world in which they live. A world set in a time after the Final World War. A world with all our knowledge today and the wisdom in some cases not to use that knowledge. A world that regardless of the time, place and laws it\u2019s governed by\u2026 doesn\u2019t change the fact that as humans we are all ruled by something.S.K. Munt's version in the \"The Given Garden\" of Heaven and Hell, God and Satan and how everything revolves around a society that doesn't believe or practice in \"religion\" in this post-apocalyptic fiction is brilliantly pieced together like a tapestry with its details to depict a story through picture. Each thread is sewn and overlapped so well that you can't imagine (I can't) all the detail that went into creating this masterpiece. I wanted to add, just when it was getting good it ended, but the entire damn book was so good it would be lie. Luckily, I'm coming into a series that I don't have to wait for the next installment... because I would be devastated!Eagerly starting the next book in The Eden Chronicles...

When they turn 13, their world changes forever. This is a story of how strong a young girl has to be to fulfill her dreams of freedom. *********************************************************I just finished this book and man, I'm speechless. I laughed, I cried, I snapped at my children for disturbing me while I read. I could not put it down and when I had to drive my kids around for 2 hours today, I was bitter, \nBITTER\n I tell you! The caste system, the (what I would call) dystopian society...it was so deep, so heavy. It compeletely engrossed me for the 6 hours it took for me to read it.Munt's world-building is intricate. At times it can be a bit much but it's obvious that she spent a tremendous amount of time creating her caste and belief system, the post-apocalyptic world and the history behind it all. Each character is complex. There are so many heartbreaking and incredibly sweet scenes. And the cliffhanger...MUST HAVE BOOK TWO IMMEDIATELY."}, {"userName": "Amanda  Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53456859-amanda-morgan", "userReview": "FantasticThis book was absolutely amazing and I really didn't want to put it down.

The Given Garden is Book #1 in The Eden Chronicles, and is set six hundred years after Armageddon, where Utopia is the goal, but chaos is the result.
