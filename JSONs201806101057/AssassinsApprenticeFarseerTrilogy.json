The adventures of Fitz through three trilogies account for a big chunk of that reading.Robin Hobb can write a first person story with rare skill. She shows you a world though Fitz's eyes and makes it matter, makes it vital. Some elements of Hobb's fantasy are fairly old school, but written with a modern style and a literary skill that one almost never used to see in fantasy and is still hard to find in the genre.What Hobb does best, quite possibly better than every other fantasy writer, is build, develop, and breathe life into relationships. She writes great characters that you can believe in, but it's in interactions that they truly shine. The friendship between Fitz and the Fool is the heart of the two trilogies, and grows at a slow but steady pace through the books.The rigid social structure and its constraints generate a lot of frustration for Fitz (and by extension for the readers). This drives much of the tension and plot. Some readers may find it too frustrating and may long for Fitz to break free of it, to drive his message home etc... but for me it was perfectly pitched for maximum effect.I won't address the plot ... but it's good, and the mysterious attackers are chilling and intriguing. In short - go read this classic!Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes.."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "I read this again through audio so I can continue on with the series. The narrator was Paul Boehmer and I thought he did a great job \ud83d\ude04\nThese were the lessons in my assassin's primer. And more. Sleight of hand and the art of moving stealthily. Where to strike a man to render him unconscious. Where to strike a man so that he dies without crying out. Where to stab a man so that he dies without too much blood welling out. I learned it all rapidly and well, thriving under Chade's approval of my quick mind.\nIf your looking for a big ole bloody and everything goes book, this is not it. This is just a great story about a boy that was born to not knowing the love of a mother or father. But he still turned out to be a good person, even if he was an assassin. Fitz is a wonderful character even though he went through a lot as a child. He was brought to the royal guard at 6 years-old by his grandfather telling them he was done with him and it was time for Prince Chivalry to take care of his own son. As you can read on the blurb, Fitz wasn't born the proper way.But Fitz was allowed to stay with the stable master, Burrich, whom I loved very much. He was so kind to the horses, dogs, and hawks that belonged to the Prince and he was very kind to Fitz. Although, there is one part with someone named Nosy that I thought he didn't something bad to and it turns out he didn't so I forgive him. Those of you that have read the book know what I mean. Fitz has the ability to get inside an animals mind. I call it mind melding and they can see through each others eyes and communicate. They call this the Will in the book. But Fitz also learns how to use the Skill which is a form of telepathy <--- I think that's the word I'm looking for. Fitz father, Prince Chivalry never once met him. He left with his wife to go into exile because of the boy and he stepped down from being next in line to be the King. I didn't understand this part too good but that was how I saw it. At one point when Fitz is a little older, I think around 10, his other grandfather who was King Shrewd decided to start getting him trained as an assassin. Burrich was hoping that he would keep being ignored but that wasn't so. Prince Regal who was a jerk beyond jerkdom didn't like this at all. Prince Verity didn't seem to mind. He was always kind to Fitz. Prince Verity is another character that I grew to love because of his kindness to Fitz and their relationship later on in the book. I think this was a really good book to start out the trilogy. Robin Hobb brings us slowly into a world that she built for us to enjoy along the way. Yes, there are some bad people trying to do bad things but isn't there always? But that fact that I could read a fantasy book that wasn't all about - cut off their head, burn, burn, burn, rape this and rape that - was actually pretty nice =)There are some people that say this book is slow and that is why I said if your looking for some huge action book, this is not it. If your looking for a journey with some good people than you will enjoy it. I really hope I enjoy the next two books in the trilogy as much as this one!

It\u2019s not an overstatement to say that The Realm of the Elderlings is hands down my biggest gamble of all time in the history of book buying; I bought it without using my brain, after all. You may call me shallow, my interest in this series sparked due to the reason that the UK paperbacks cover are so damn pretty. This reason alone, of course, shouldn\u2019t be enough to justify spending tons of money on an author or series that you never tried yet; but it does, my friend. When Assassin\u2019s Apprentice came to my doorstep in the middle of my dilemma on my birthday last year (thank you, Haifa), my decision was made. Looking at how pretty the book in real life, I immediately bought all the available\u2014excluding Assassin\u2019s Fate\u2014UK paperbacks of the entire series for a whopping price of $200. This is the reason why I always say to both authors and book publishers that book covers do matter a LOT in capturing reader\u2019s attention; especially on books that readers haven\u2019t heard of or try yet.Obviously, I can\u2019t be sure yet if my ridiculous gamble will pay off or not until I reach the end. However, for now, I can say that this is a wonderful start to one of the biggest fantasy series of our time, and I hope it will remain that way until the end of the journey. Assassin\u2019s Apprentice is the first book in the Farseer Trilogy, the first series out of five that encompassed Robin Hobb\u2019s The Realm of the Elderlings series. There are plenty of opinion on how slow this trilogy is and you know what? I can\u2019t disagree with them. Not only because it\u2019s a foundational book, it\u2019s really a slow burn mostly due to how dense the pages and how scarce the dialogues are; readers just have to deal with spending most of their time within Fitz\u2019s head. I am a huge fan of slow-paced books but even with that fact, I still think this is, in fact, the slowest start to a series I\u2019ve ever read; sometimes even draggy. However, this doesn\u2019t change my opinion that as a foundational start, the book does its job wonderfully.Picture: Assassin\u2019s Apprentice by Dagmara MatuszakThe main character, FitzChivalry Farseer is a six years old bastard who\u2019s learning to be an Assassin while at the same time living a harsh life of being hated by practically everyone just because of his birthright. Hobb\u2019s characterizations are simply terrific. Although we see things only from Fitz perspective in 1st person POV, all the side character\u2019s personality were still well established; there are plenty of characters for readers to love and hate. Tons of people have said that all of Hobb\u2019s books\u2014including this one\u2014are super depressing and exhausting to read, I can't say for the other books yet but regarding the first book, I\u2019ll have to disagree with this notion. Yes, Fitz is living a harsh life for sure, but I found his struggle and perseverance in his adolescence here to be something I enjoyed reading. This is mostly due to the reason that Fitz has a strong affinity with animals, and the friendship between human and animals\u2014especially dogs\u2014are something I will never get enough of.\n\n\u201cMen cannot grieve as dogs do. But they grieve for many years.\u201d\n\nGreat characterizations aside, the two magic systems\u2014Skills and Wit\u2014are very simple in concept and yet it fits Fitz (see what I did there?) storyline and the world really well; I can't wait to read more of the usage of these two magic systems in the future installments. Hobb\u2019s world-building is also highly detailed and vibrant. Reading the book immersed me deeply if I was really there. After all that has been said and done, the main factor of the book that worked exceptionally well for me was Hobb\u2019s prose. It\u2019s simple, beautiful, and was just a pure delight for me to read. Hobb has a way of structuring her words and sentences into something profoundly memorable, and this is only the first book of her huge series too!\n\n\u201cAll events, no matter how earthshaking or bizarre, are diluted within moments of their occurrence by the continuance of the necessary routines of day-to-day living.\u201d\n\nOverall, Assassin\u2019s Apprentice is a great start to a series. The pacing can be better but considering that this is a foundational book to an overall gigantic series, let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m impressed and will continue immediately to the sequels, at the same time hoping the next books will get even better than this.Picture: Assassin's Apprentice by Marc SimonettiYou can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"}, {"userName": "Virginia Ronan \u2665 Herondale \u2665", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69106439-virginia-ronan-herondale", "userReview": "\u201dMost prisons are of our own making. A man makes his own freedom, too.\u201dSo this was my first Robin Hobb and I\u2019m positively surprised! =) I mean after reading all those raving reviews I already expected that \u201cAssassin\u2019s Apprentice\u201d would be a good book, I definitely wasn\u2019t prepared for the train of feels that occasionally hit me though. Well, truth be told, that\u2019s actually a bold understatement. For a book that started out so slowly there certainly were a lot of intense and awesome scenes that had me hooked almost right from the beginning and if you ask me, it\u2019s as good as impossible to read them without being swept away! Hobb has an undeniable talent for the fine arts of building up an interesting storyline and as far as I could tell she never even hesitated to use it! ;-PWhile you read the book you stumble over all those typical fantasy tropes (young boy, apprenticeship, relation to the royal family, hard life, etc.), yet the author still managed to make something intriguing and unique. It\u2019s like she used those fantasy tropes as a scaffold in order to build her own world and ideas around it. And tell you what? It worked! XDThis was such a wonderful read and the fact I already borrowed book two from the library should be enough to persuade you to give it a try! ;-)Since the title of the book is kinda self-explanatory (Assassin\u2019s Apprentice? I can\u2019t help but wonder what it\u2019s going to be about! *lol*) I won\u2019t talk about the plot and will dive right into the characters section instead! The characters:\nWARNING! This is the danger zone! *lol* I\u2019ll spoil in here and if you hate to be spoiled you better run in the other direction! ;-P Can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you, can you? XD\nFitzChivalry:\u201dI know he meant well. But I did not feel protected by him, but confined. He was the warden that ensured my isolation with fanatical fervour. Utter loneliness was planted in me then, and set its deep roots down into me.\u201d Aww Fitz! I love this Boy! (See what I did there?! XD) He\u2019s so sweet and funny and I can already see him becoming a sassy and clever protagonist in the future! Unfortunately he still has to learn a lot about life and the dangerous world he\u2019s living in so I mostly felt really sorry for him while reading this book. There were so many moments that broke my heart and there were times I was like: CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE THIS POOR BOY A BREAK?!! Plus some of the scenes were so damn amazing that they really stuck with me. For instance the \u201cSilver Knife Scene\u201d! Chade and King Shrewd wanted to test Fitz loyalty and they did it in a very cruel way. My poor Boy suffered so much but once the problem was resolved he didn\u2019t back down. No! He made his point by stealing a silver knife right in front of his King and driving it into the wood of Chade\u2019s shelf! *LOL* THAT WAS SO DAMN AWESOME!!!! The sass and defiance!!! Gosh I loved it so much! Plus can we acknowledge the wonderful atmosphere of the \u201cPoison Scene\u201d? It easily became one of my all-time favourite scenes and the twist was executed so well I could only gasp in disbelieve and awe! So cleverly done, Hobb! So cleverly done! *shakes head*Chade:\u201dI\u2019ll be teaching you the nasty, furtive, polite ways to kill people. You\u2019ll either develop a taste for it, or not. That isn\u2019t something I\u2019m in charge of. But I\u2019ll make sure you know how.\u201dHaha! Chade instantly became one of my favourites of this book! I mean he\u2019s the Royal Assassin and he\u2019s a wise and good man. He has principles, he knows his limits and he did his best to tap his full potential. It made me very sad he was so painfully aware of the fact that he was raising and educating the next generation and that his use was going to run out as soon as his replacement was ready. Yet he still knew that it wasn\u2019t Fitz fault and taught him everything he needed in order to do his job. I have a very deep respect for Chade and I really hope he\u2019ll live through the next two books. \u201dSometimes,\u201d grumbled Chade, \u201cit is better to be defiantly wrong than silent.\u201d\u201dYou\u2019re a bastard, Fitz. We\u2019re always a risk and vulnerability. We\u2019re always expendable. Except when we are an absolute necessity to their own security.\u201dBurrich:\u201dYou failed? No, Fitz. I fialed. I was too soft-hearted to beat it out of you at the first sign of it.\u201dGosh, I\u2019m still so torn when I think of Burrich. I mean in some way he\u2019s Fitz father figure and it\u2019s clear he only meant well, but boy the way he tried to raise him was so damn wrong sometimes. *sighs* I mean every parent makes mistakes; we\u2019re all human after all, but to punish Fitz so much? He and Nosy were everything Fitz had and that stubborn mule named Burrich just didn\u2019t realise how much Fitz needed and loved him. He was just a little boy that needed a safe place and it should have been Burrich who provided it. I mean he didn\u2019t even give him a chance to explain. He would have been dead without Fitz connection to Smithy, yet he refused to listen to him. ARGH!!! It makes me so angry. *lol* I know Anish has a different opinion about him, but I just can\u2019t forgive Burrich for what he did. *sighs deeply*\u201dHow you must have hated me.\u201d\u201cAnd feared you.\u201d\u201cAll those years? And you never learned better of me, never thought to yourself, \u2018He would not do such a thing\u2019?\u201dVerity:\u201dI must have dozed, for I woke to his hand on my hair. \u201cDo they tell you to watch over me so, boy, even when I sleep? What do they fear, then?\u201d\u201cNaught that I know, Verity. They tell me only to bring you food, and see as best I can that you eat it. No more than that.\u201dI absolutely adored and loved Verity! He\u2019s such an awesome character and he\u2019s always true to his name. I really liked his relationship with Fitz and I hope he\u2019ll feel a lot better in the next book. It hurt to see how much the Skill took from him and for a second near the end I really thought he wouldn\u2019t make it. =( Gosh that was suspenseful! *lol* I\u2019m just glad he\u2019s fine now and I\u2019m sure Princess Kettricken and him will make a wonderful couple. They are both on the more practical side of things and even though it\u2019s no marriage of love, I\u2019m sure Verity will win her heart. (Maybe she\u2019ll win his too? XD)Regal:\u201dRuthlessness creates its own rules. So my mother taught me. People are intimidated by a man who acts with no apparent regard for consequences. Behave as if you cannot be touched and no one will dare to touch you.\u201dI hate Regal! I hate him so much! Such an arrogant, snobby, superior feeling little piece of s***! He\u2019s a clever villain; I have to give him that but his obvious distaste for Fitz caused me to dislike him from the very start! I mean there are villains and then there are villains! Regal is one I just can\u2019t help but hate! XD How he and Galen treated Fitz was so cruel that I wanted to bang their heads together multiple times! And don\u2019t even get me started about the death of Nosy, if it wouldn\u2019t have been for Nosy Fitz would have died at the end. =((( Oh my, poor Nosy. That last paragraph killed me. He saved him, He dragged him out of the water and then he died, trying to give him strength\u2026 I can\u2019t even\u2026 *sobs violently*King Shrewd:\u201dA bastard, Regal, is a unique thing. Put a signet ring on his hand and send him forth, and you have created a diplomat no foreign ruler will dare to turn away. He may safely be sent where a prince of the blood may not be risked. Imagine the uses for one who is and yet is not of the royal bloodline. Hostage exchanges. Marital alliances. Quiet work. The diplomacy of the knife.\u201dI still don\u2019t know what to make out of King Shrewd. I mean at the moment he\u2019s obviously on Fitz\u2019s and Verity\u2019s side, but I have no idea which side he\u2019ll choose when we get a better grasp of the big picture. I have no doubt that he\u2019s an opportunist and he\u2019s certainly shrewd enough to use this to his advantage. Plus Regal and Verity are his sons. He might care for them both but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll support whoever wins their dangerous game in the end. So yeah, I\u2019m #TeamVerity and I really hope Regal won\u2019t get a second chance. ;-)The Fool:\u201dBecause your heart will be hammered against him, and your strength will be tempered in his fire.\u201dI loved the Fool! He\u2019s so mysterious and such an intriguing character. I really would have liked to find out more about him, but Hobb kept us in the dark and I\u2019m convinced she had her reasons to do so. I\u2019m pretty sure the Fool knows about everything that happens at court and I\u2019m also more than just certain that he\u2019s an advisor of King Shrewd. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that there\u2019s more to him though and that he might have even disobeyed some of the king\u2019s commands in order to help Fitz. Hobb, I want more of the Fool in the next book! XDThe Wit and The Skill:\u201dThe appetite for the Skill is one that devours a man, not one that nourishes him.\u201dBoy did it take long until we finally got a decent explanation what the Skill is about. *lol* I know Anish was getting impatient and so was I! Haha! Whilst it\u2019s true that the Skill is an intriguing ability, I\u2019m still fascinated with the Wit as well. I\u2019m convinced that those two go hand in hand and could work together and if I\u2019m correct it\u2019s really remarkable Fitz has an aptitude for both! =) The quote above made me think there might be a connection and since the Skill devours a man and the Wit seems to nourish it, Fitz could be a more than just powerful man! Just think about all the possibilities! ;-PAnd with this thought I\u2019m finally ending my rather long review. XD\u201cAssassin\u2019s Apprentice\u201d was an amazing and well-thought-out fantasy tale and I\u2019m already curious about the next book! =)Since this was a buddy read with The Sweet Manisha and The Amazing Anish I want to thank them both. I\u2019m sorry Manisha had to drop out of our buddy read at some point but I\u2019m still glad you guys were willing to read this book with me! Thank you for experiencing this with me and also thank you for your interesting thoughts and input! =) It definitely made this an even better read! ;-)"}, {"userName": "A.

The boy is despised for the simple fact that he exists. He is a royal bastard, and his dishonourable conception means that his father\u2019s name is forever sullied; that much so that he was forced to abdicate the throne; thus, half the royal Farseer court already hates Fitz because he is, supposedly, the reason why the popular Prince had to retire from court life. Poor, poor, Fitz, he was hated from the very beginning.  He was used rather than destroyed  I think King Shrewd truly lives up to his name sake because he has such an interesting way of dealing with unwanted potential claimants to his throne. Instead of simply murdering Fitz, and ridding himself of a potential threat, he binds the boy to himself with unwavering loyalty. He turns Fitz into an assassin; he gives him a home and protection in return for one day being the assassin of the Farseer court. Nobody else could give the unwanted boy such a deal. Shrewd is truly shrewd. I think this is a truly brilliant idea naming characters this way because the individuals eventually begin to embody their name\u2019s sake; it helps to demonstrate what a particular character is about and make them sound rather royal in the process. I love it. Not all characters are named this way, but for those that are it works really well. The character development in this novel alone is phenomenal. Fitz is forged into an assassin in just three hundred pages, though this is no easy task. His mentor, Chade, is kind and guiding, but he also expects a great deal out of his pupil. Fitz is forced into an unsuspecting test of loyalty, and in his childlike innocence he could quite easily have made the wrong decision. Most children would have, but he has a slight edge: he has Farseer blood. And he has also experienced the worse the court has to offer. Fitz has learnt to survive, and he has learnt to accept his mentor\u2019s advice almost without question. \u201cLearning is never wrong. Even learning how to kill isn't wrong. Or right. It's just a thing to learn, a thing I can teach you. That's all.\u201dBut, that doesn\u2019t mean Fitz has to like his work; it is something he must do. In this, Fitz never loses himself. He becomes an assassin, but he doesn\u2019t become a murderer. It\u2019s a thin line, I know. However, if the people being assassinated pose a threat to the peace of the Six Duchies, then surely the deed can be considered noble and just. To my mind, Fitz is truly heroic because of this. He is the perfect protagonist, and he is written wonderfully. None of this is easy for him though. The killing is hard, but learning his innate magic is even harder. His upbringing is a truly arduous time because of this; he is not only being trained as an assassin, but also to wield the ancient magic known as the skill. Two fantastic magic systems  Robin Hobb\u2019s magic systems are as dangerous as they are spectacular. Fitz\u2019 trainer in the skill (a powerful form of telepathic magic) is a tyrannical and sadistic man; he is one of those strong haters of the boy, and uses every opportunity to abuse and torture him. He is the exact opposite of the kindly Chade: he is simply brutal. The Skill master\u2019s hatred for Fitz is completely unreasonable and undoubtable. As the novel progresses the reasoning behind the cruelty becomes less and less obvious, until its odd origins are revealed. Fitz truly didn\u2019t have much chance picking up the basics of the skill form this so called master of the magic; he struggles for many years with it afterwards because of his treatment by the brute. \u201cVery little worth knowing is taught by fear.\u201dAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, for poor little Fitz to shoulder, he also has the Wit magic. This is even harder for him to understand because he is not fully aware that he has it. It is a rare form of power that allows him to communicate with animals. This communication can then form unto a lasting bond, if both user and beast mutually agree. They link minds in lasting friendship. His surrogate farther, Burrich, views the magic as a perversity and punishes the boy whenever he suspects he uses it; thus, Robin Hobb has given Fitz a lot to deal with. The result is a very confused boy who has too much of a burden. It\u2019s a miracle he actually manages to get out of bed in the morning with the amount of things craving his time and attention. At this point, I don\u2019t think I really need to say I love this book, but I\u2019ll do it anyway: I love this book! This is such a great opening to the series and whilst it is already complicated for Fitz, it\u2019s only going to get worse; this is merely the beginning of his life and his story. He has barely seen the Fool for what he is yet, which is much more than a jester. I can\u2019t wait to read the rest of the series again, and post my reviews. This is my favourite modern fantasy series. Nobody does this quite like Robin Hobb; she weaves such strong emotions into her characters.The Farseer Trilogy1.

I know this is a fantasy favorite among so many people I trust, but I never expected it to be as perfect as it was! Fitz and his journey was an absolute joy to read about, and I cannot wait to continue on with this world. Like, I need the next book now. This story is a slow burn, that's for sure, but learning about the main protagonist, Fitz, and his back story made the slow pace still really enjoyable. Fitz is a bastard of the king in waiting, Chivalry. When he is only six-years old, his grandfather on his mother's side takes him to his father. Obviously he is a blemish on the royal Farseer family's appearance, but his Uncle Verity orders that he be given to the King's stableman, Burrich*, instead. Fitz's father, however, felt so much shame with having a bastard; he goes into exile, giving up his right to the throne*Also, besides Fitz, Burrich was the MVP of this story. I love that man. His cameos kept warming my heart to no end. Yeah, Fitz's Uncle Verity is awesome. Unfortunately, his other uncle, Regal, is a major ass and likes to make Fitz's life extremely hard. See, Fitz has something that the book refers to as \"the Wit\", which basically means that Fitz is able to speak telepathically to animals. Also, for as much as people rave about this series, I was so surprised with Fitz's gift with animals! I had never heard anyone talk about it before, so it was such an amazing surprise and truly made this reading experience even better. Fitz's connection to animals really meant a lot to me. I'm a huge animal lover, and I've read a lot of fantasy in my days, and this was such a unique and meaningful concept, I was in awe with how perfectly Robin Hobb executed this element. Using Wit isn't the only magic in this book; we are also introduced to Skilling, which the royal family seems to do with ease. Like using Wit, Skilling is also done telepathically, but instead of animals it is between humans, but we soon learn that using this ability in mass quantities taxes a person very much.Anyways, once Fitz is a little older, his grandpa on his father's side, you know, the King, gets Fitz to become a \"King's Man\", which is basically an assassin. He is then given to a man named Chade to become *wait for it* an assassin's apprentice! Oh, and all the Six Duchies are being attacked by Red-Ship Raiders, who steal people and bring them back with no memory and as shells of their former selves. So, that's a pretty big problem that I'm sure will be addressed even more in the continuation of this series. I really don't have much to complain about, except that this story is a little slow. Yet, with that slow build, I felt so much empathy for Fitz and the poor hand he got dealt in life. This story truly was on the sadder side of stories, and I want nothing more than for Fitz to get a happy ending, filled with all the cute puppers in the world. This is for sure a story about love and loyalty, and where people should put their trust. Is the importance on blood truly so great? Does blood really connect us in an explained way that makes it more important than other qualities? How much trust can we put into people just because of their blood, while ignoring everything else that person holds inside of them?

This can lead to great nuanced detail supporting imaginative storytelling... but the flipside can be a creation that fails to translate that vision to the actual page, to the audience.Assassin's Apprentice illustrates this point fairly well. Robin Hobb has clearly lovingly created the world of the Six Duchies, and this love is echoed through the tale's device: born a bastard son to the king's heir, Fitz recalls growing up in the intense environment of court and his first mission as the king's assassin. It's not the most original premise, but Hobb revels in the details of the world's class divide and trade routes and political alliances. However, she forgets to tell us why we should *care* about any of this.I'm sure the whole thing is some epic prequel to Fitz's story of some sort, but I want to hear *that* story, not the backlog. It's not unpleasant but after the fifth exposition dialogue of political machinations in which I was given no stake, I didn't really see a reason to continue reading. The main character simply meandered around in a seemingly unending training montage with nary a purpose in sight. I don't mind a slow buildup, but the ideas here, while artfully portrayed, were still very much in a generic-court-fantasy mold... giving me no incentive to stick around (no payoff to collect).

This tale starts with our main character, Fitz (age 6), being brought to the Farseer\u2019s army outpost by his maternal grandfather and given to a soldier, who is told that he is King-in-Waiting Chivalry's bastard son. The soldier brings him to the commander of the outpost, Prince Verity, who orders that he be given into the care of Burrich, Chivalry's stablemaster and right-hand man. Before Burrich takes him to Buckkeep, the capital of the Six Duchies, his father abdicates from his position and retires to the Withywoods with his wife Patience so he never got the chance to meet him.Burrich is left with the task of raising him and being a stablemaster he teaches him how to take care of animals. During his time with animals he discovers he can bond telepathically with them and that is the form of magic called the Wit, an ancient magic which Burrich forbids him to practice. The Wit is very much similar to the Skill, a magic system practiced by the royal family, which gives them ability to share thoughts and strength. We follow the rest of story through a first person POV, so we pretty much see and feel the world and characters through the eyes and mind of our main protagonist thus creating a strong bond with him and that is something really important to me when reading; I need a character I can root for and Fitz is just that kind of character, not only did I root for him, he also managed to evoke a strong emotional empathy in me and that shows a great skill Hobb has in characterization.This is a slow paced book and I know that can be off putting for some readers who demand explosive action on every page because \u201cnothing is happening\u201d otherwise but in this case the pacing is suitable for the story because this is a character driven story with very strong emphasis on character development which was superbly done.The prose feels simple yet beautiful and often reminded me of Rothfuss\u2019s writing and if I had to guess I would say that Hobb influenced him very much.I was completely mesmerized with the magic of this book. It is a beautiful coming-of-age tale which captivated my mind and made me realize why is it deemed a true classic and a pure fantasy gem.With the first quest completed, I\u2019m ready for the next one and eager to find out what fate lies ahead for Fitz in the Royal Assassin."}, {"userName": "Loederkoningin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4878104-loederkoningin", "userReview": "With the exciting news of a brand new series about Fitz & the Fool, The Fool's Assassin, in mind, we are buddy reading this series in December and continue with the Tawny Man trilogy.

A few Hobb trilogies further along the way, this is where it all started. At first Assassin's Apprentice seems like your typical fantasy book. Yep, the unwanted orphan, seaside fortress, clandestine politics, a good dash of magic and adventure are all present. However, Hobb is something else. To say that these books are pretty intense is an understatement. I will just mention that while engrossed in the last chapters of the second book and then book three of this series, I actually started missing my train station. Twice. And had to wait for at least half an hour in the dark dreary February weather to catch a train the other way.

This book was one of the most joyful slow-burners that I've read. Think 'The Name of the Wind.' It's about our precious Fitz, a bastard, who has been brought up by someone who used to work closely with his father. It is narrated by Fitz himself and we follow his life closely from childhood till his young teenage years. The writing is quite simply, stunning. From page one I was hooked on it. It's enchanting, immersive and has a dream-like feel to it. Hobb really has a way with story-telling. It lingers and stays with you. The style of narrative was just great. At times, it did feel a bit too slow for my personal taste. This is not the book to read if you're looking for a story that is fast-paced. The plot moves on its own accord, but there's so much to it! It really delves into Fitz's character, as well as others, and one really forms an attachment to him in particular. Seriously, Fitz had better be protected at all costs! My heart broke for him so many times whilst reading it! One random thing (not too random, since animals are key to the story) is that this book made me wish I had a dog. And I am not an animal person at all, but the way Hobb wrote the relationships our main character, who I almost feel like is my son now, had with dogs in this story just made me want to tear up constantly. It was so damn beautiful! I cannot wait to see how this story progresses. I'm SO excited to find out more about the magic system (Wit and Skill. One allows you to form this incredible, unique bond with animals and the other is like telephathy! SO COOL!!!), the world, and the Forged people.

Can you maybe, I don\u2019t know, define what \u201cthis\u201d is, on account of the fact that empathetic internet is, as of yet, at least still a few years away?)\u201cThis\u201d is fully realized, well written and conceived, and faithful to some of the most tried and true fantasy tropes while simultaneously standing one very big one on its heads (namely, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m spoiling anything that\u2019s not in the title of the book here, that our main character, Fitz, is being trained to be an assassin, a line of work that is not generally considered sympatico vis-\u00e0-vis being a heroic paragon of virtue). As much as anything, this is a coming of age story, and it\u2019s paced accordingly. You know how, growing up, your life is marked by milestones (first sleepover, staying home alone the first time, first kiss, driver\u2019s license, first time you manage to kill a dracolich in a game of 2nd edition AD&D (an event that likely transpired long, long before your first kiss)) that break up an otherwise monotonous cycle of school, chores, hanging out with friends, exploring the wondrous things that can happen when you spend time alone with a bottle of Jurgens contemplating the shower scene in National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation, etc.? That\u2019s basically what reading The Assassin\u2019s Apprentice is like, but that\u2019s neither a critique nor an indicator that it\u2019s in any way boring. Monotony generally implies boringness, but I would argue that all of those repetitive activities you undertook growing up incrementally formed your character (or, at least, chafed your most sensitive parts, depending on how frequently you indulged in thoughts of an in-her-prime Beverly D\u2019Angelo). So it is for Fitz, and watching him undergo his journey\u2014slow and painful though it can occasionally be\u2014is a delight. Hobb builds her world methodically, brick by brick; she manages to deftly balance driving the story forward while highlighting the unique features of the world, and never once do you feel as though you\u2019re on world-building data dump overload. Her writing is a delight, and she conjures a feel reminiscent of some of the fantasy luminaries I enjoyed working my way through when I really started to get into reading fantasy late in high school (the two who come foremost to mind, in terms of making a tonal comparison, are David Eddings and Raymond Feist). Would I have liked a little bit more action here and there, a little more with the swords and the heroics and magic fireballs? Sure. But, that\u2019s true in real life as well. Who doesn\u2019t love fireballs? Nonetheless, I\u2019m more than sufficiently hooked to continue on, to see if Fitz can remain a sympathetic character as he moves from apprentice assassin to the master assassin, to explore more of this intriguing world, and to go dig out my old VHS copy of Vacation.(And, hey\u2014how can you not love a book that starts off with a man sleeping with animals in the first 10 pages? Just sleeping, people\u2014no funny business.

He is branded early on as the bastard of Prince Chivalry Farseer, eldest & deceased son of King Shrewd Farseer. And so begins the slow & steady descent of our main character into a life fraught with hardship after hardship.Which brings us around to one of my main struggles with this story. The first 80-85% of this book is a slow trudge through Fitz's childhood, exploring the many brutal ways in which he is ostracized by his peers, bullied by his superiors, & deprived of the connections he so desperately desires. Fitz's relentless misfortune definitely wore me out on an emotional level.It's not even that he's always suffering in some huge, dramatic way. Fitz's younger years are made up of a variety of large & small hurts that, combined, would threaten to topple even a confident adult. I found this aspect of the story to be quite believable, but exhausting. There are definitely a lot of recognizable fantasy archetypes present here: \u2718 Underdog/Bastard MC \u2718 Gruff Father Figure\u2718 Bratty Prince\u2718 Wise Old Master\u2718 Chosen OneBut I don't believe any one of them are written in a way that feels overdone. Each character is believable in their role & defined enough that they transcend their archetypal labels. I would've liked to know a bit more about the world outside of Buckkeep. I have a decent idea about what goes on there, but not a very clear picture of the Duchies outside of that one or the surrounding lands. I think perhaps the strict first person PoV is a bit damaging in this respect because we are limited to experiencing places as Fitz visits them, and because he is a child for a lot of the book he spends most of his time at Buckkeep. But seeing that Hobb has shown herself to be a thorough writer, I feel as though this aspect will likely remedy itself in the later installments of the series. The two forms of magic introduced to us do help make up a bit of ground in the world building department. The Wit & The Skill are both forms of mental connection, the former having to do with bonding to animals & the latter having to do with subtly influencing the actions of people.I have heard for years that Robin Hobb is a queen among Fantasy authors, and purely from this first experience with her writing style I can definitely see why she has earned that reputation. Her way with words is beautifully poised. It's the kind of writing that falls into place so effortlessly that it inspires you to try your own hand at it. I found myself plenty of times thinking \"Wow what a lovely way to phrase that!\"Speaking of writing, I think an important thing to know going into this series is that this first book is very foundational. It spends a lot of quality time developing Fitz through his adolescence, so much so that by the end you really do feel as though you've experienced years of his life. Because of this, the pace is absolutely slow. Slow to the point that I was actually feeling the drag, and I typically don't have issues with a sluggish pace. However, the climax of the book is certainly more exciting & justifies all the time spent getting there. I don't know if I'll ever reread this book, as it is more of a framework than anything else. It is methodically crafted & necessary, but to say I enjoyed it might give the wrong impression. I do respect it for what it is, and I believe it serves its purpose in setting the stage for events later to come."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30749549-samantha", "userReview": "Even better the second time around!"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "After reading maybe a few too many YA fantasies, it was a breath of fresh air to delve into the world of Fitz, the assassin's apprentice. It was complex and layered, the way I like my fantasies and, I suppose, my reading generally (other than the brain-candy romance cravings, which tend to attack me randomly and without prior warning). Fitz, the bastard son of the crown prince with a peasant woman, is taken from his mother as a six year old boy and dropped into the royal household. This novel follows Fitz from his childhood, rejected by many and ignored by almost all others, to about age fifteen, as he grows in magical powers both with \"the Wit,\" which allows him to share minds with animals, and \"the Skill,\" a telepathic power. He also gains some more sinister learning, as the king's assassin, Chade, teaches him the skills of dealing out death to those that the king thinks need to be out of the way - for good reasons or bad. And the kingdom is under attack, both from within and without, so Fitz's peculiar skills will become necessary.There are mysteries and oddities about this world that are revealed slowly, but didn't give me the feeling that the author was hiding the ball just to stretch out the suspense. It's a book that made my brain work a little to follow all of the threads and layers, rather than making me want to skim ahead just to get to the end.Minus a star for being a little slow in parts and leaving several loose threads at the end. It's the first in a series, so I'm sure those threads get wrapped up later, but for the most part I think this works reasonably well as a stand-alone novel. Overall I thought it was a really intriguing fantasy, with enough depth and detail to really suck me into this world.

I have seen that shape before, I think, but it was not ink then. A trickle of drying blood on the deck of a Red-Ship, and mine the hand that spilled it? Or was it a tendril of smoke rising black against a blue sky as I rode too late to warn a village of a Red-Ship raid? Or poison swirling and unfurling yellowly in a simple glass of water, poison I had handed someone, smiling all the while? The artless curl of a strand of woman's hair left upon my pillow? Or the trail a man's heels left in the sand as we dragged the bodies from the smoldering tower at Sealbay? The track of a tear down a mother's cheek as she clutched her Forged infant to her despite his angry cries? Like Red-Ships, the memories come without warning, without mercy.An angry old man arrives at the gates of Buckkeep, capital of the Kingdom of the Six Duchies, dragging his six-year old grandson along. Determined not to listen to his daughter\u2019s desperate cries from behind them, the old man delivers the child to a guardsman, and demands that his father take care of him from now on. And the child\u2019s father, he says to the perplexed guardsman, is Prince Chivalry Farseer, king-in-waiting and heir to the throne.The boy who comes to be known as Fitz becomes something of a liability for the Farseer royal family upon his untimely arrival at Buckkeep. Chivalry, a man whose honour is everything to him, abdicates his position in the line of succession and thus causes an uproar in the Six Duchies. And Fitz himself, doomed to the life of a bastard, must put his life in the hands of King Shrewd. And he must decide between being put to death for no other reason than being who he is, and being turned into a lethal weapon for the king to use. An assassin\u2026Robin Hobb\u2019s writing is one of the strengths of this novel. It is extraordinarily simple, and yet greatly satisfying. I also really enjoyed the book\u2019s narrative, written from the point of view of Fitz as an old man describing the events of his youth. That kind of retrospective, nostalgic writing style is deeply reminiscent of one of my all-time favourite authors, Bernard Cornwell. And even though Cornwell in my opinion does it a lot better, Robin Hobb is also quite certainly a master of this art.The setting is not particularly complex or innovative, but one could say that it, like so many other aspects of this novel, grows more and more interesting for each single chapter. The Kingdom of the Six Duchies is, like most other medieval fantasy settings, a feudal monarchy built by farmers and soldiers. Most of the story takes place in the capital city of Buckkeep, but some of the most interesting events occur in outlying villages or even in the bordering Mountain Kingdoms. The fact that Hobb reveals remarkably little of the other locations, cultures and nations of this world, also helps to make it seem more mysterious and fascinating.The characters are a bit more difficult to talk about. Aside from Fitz himself, almost every single character is completely generic and more or less one-dimensional. In Chivalry, Verity and Regal we have three different versions of royal princes all so often found in medieval fantasy, and their father King Shrewd is most definitely a rather typical monarch. Most of Fitz\u2019 teachers also fit the various stereotypes of fantasy. Despite all that, I should say that I really enjoyed reading about them. Within the confines of their roles, these characters were very well developed. Robin Hobb seems to have a way to make her readers care about what happens even to minor characters, not to mention the protagonist himself. And there are obviously also a few more interesting characters, like the Fool and the Lady Patience, who were the two characters of this book whom I enjoyed the most.Speaking of patience, that is absolutely something one needs to read this book. When it comes to the composition and the progression of the story, Robin Hobb so far reminds me a lot of Robert Jordan, in the way that both authors apparently write books where nothing at all seems to be happening, and then they bombard the reader with tons of excitement and drama in the last five to ten chapters. One needs to get almost halfway through this book before the plot finally starts moving forward. But when it finally does that, it\u2019s hardly even possible to put it down.In the end, Assassin\u2019s Apprentice was an enjoyable book to read. It is not among the best fantasy books I\u2019ve ever read, but it was great fun reading, and it piqued my curiosity enough that I certainly want to read the rest of the books set in the Realms of the Elderlings, and get to explore this wonderful world further."}, {"userName": "Bentley \u2605 Bookbastion.net", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7971097-bentley-bookbastion-net", "userReview": "See this review and more like it on www.bookbastion.net_____________I've had Robin Hobb on my list of authors I simply must read for a few years now, but haven't had the opportunity to get my hands on one of her books until this month. I'm actually kind of glad that I waited as long as I did, if I'm honest, because in a way I think finishing this book required a patience and maturity on my part that I probably would have lacked had I tried to accomplish reading it years ago when it first started calling to me.Originally published in 1996, this definitely has a different feel to fantasy that is being published right now. In a lot of ways, I feel like narratives today have a tendency to focus more heavily on the action. There's a strong desire to hook readers earlier and earlier with fantastic and wide-reaching movement in the plot right from the beginning. In comparison,\u00a0Assassin's Apprentice has a slower, more reserved beginning that I hadn't been expecting, and had to condition myself to appreciate. At times it bordered on too slow, but for what it all ends up lending to Fitz and the world, I think it's worth it.In some ways, this book ended up feeling like one long prologue to what I am positive will be an enormous fantasy adventure. There's definitely a slow-burn set up at work here, and while I admit feeling a little bit of boredom in the first third of the book, by 30% or so Hobb starts adding in new details that set the true plot in motion and ratchet up the tension. So if you're struggling at the start, I'd say hang in there because things definitely do pick up!\u00a0As for Fitz, I just love him. I think he's a wonderful character and lens for the reader to learn about the world through. Hobb makes an interesting choice to center the narrative around Fitz telling the reader a story about his childhood/teenage years. Because of this, the narrative voice feels quite casual and conversational in tone, which I came to appreciate a great deal. Especially as some of the relationships and details about the world are a bit difficult to understand without his explanations. The way Fitz grows and matures throughout the story is phenomenal.\u00a0In fantasy, there's a real pitfall that some authors fall into where they make their characters learn too much, too fast. By stretching the story out to cover the majority of Fitz's childhood years, his growth took on a more natural progression although at times it felt a little lacking in tension. This is of course entirely personal, but when I know that a character in the future is telling a story, it removes a sense of danger from events because obviously, we know the character survives.\u00a0I will be interested to see how Hobb handles that narrative structure in the future installments though, because in some ways I feel like she might set it aside as the reader catches up with present-day Fitz and his dealings.Hobb employs a really interesting choice here to name the royal characters in the world after their biggest traits. For example, king Shrewd is as shrewd a dude as you'd expect him to be. There are also characters such as Regal, Verity, Chivalry, and Patience. At first I thought it was kind of hokey, but it actually ended up growing on me quite quickly, and it sort of helps to so clearly paint these character's most defining attributes through their society's conventional naming system. It became easier to establish them in my mind than had they all been given other names, like Bob, Henry and Samantha.Despite my reservations near the beginning of the book, this ended up being a really strong start to a fantasy series and quite a pleasant surprise. As long as you go into it knowing that it's more a simmer and less and out-and-out explosion of fantasy mayhem straight from the start, I think you'll discover there's lots to appreciate here as well. I'm very keen on seeing where Fitz's journey takes him next.\u00a0\u00a0\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f = 4/5\u00a0assassins blades"}, {"userName": "Alex Farrand", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37663070-alex-farrand", "userReview": "Assassin's Apprentice lives up to its title.

It is about this young boy coming of age and finding out who he is.First off, I thought this book would be a little bit different. I think I took the \"Assassin\" part to heart, and forgot the \"Apprentice\". You don't just jump into your trade until you really master something. Also, it was very dense in the beginning. Robin was really building everything from the ground up. I recall almost falling asleep during some of the chapters. I could have stopped reading and that is why I am giving 4 stars. BUT there came a time where I lost track of time and felt like I started breezing through the chapters. The character development was amazing. You grow with this boy. You see him decide, learn, and development mentally and physically. You see him develop from a boy who was nobody without any confidence in himself into a man with confidence, strength, and determination. You feel his heartaches, his love, and determination to succeed. I wish he was stronger during the middle of the book, but I think he surpassed it at the end. Spot on character development. During the climatic scenes I started questioning the book. I figured there would be something crazy that happened, but I forgot one person that made me start questioning the corruption. Now I have another mystery that needs to be solved. There are tons of questions that are left unanswered, and I need to read more. What does Fitz do? Does he start thinking for himself or is he still a pawn in a bigger game? Will have to find out during the next part of the trilogy!"}, {"userName": "Kat  Hooper", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2177891-kat-hooper", "userReview": "I read THE FARSEER SAGA years ago and have since considered it one of my favorite fantasy epics. It\u2019s one (along with THE LORD OF THE RINGS and MEMORY, SORROW AND THORN) that I often suggest to new fantasy readers. But after more than a decade of reading deeper and further into fantasy literature, I\u2019ve often wondered how well this saga would now appeal to my more mature (I hope) palate. When Tantor Audio recently released THE FARSEER SAGA on audio, I was overjoyed and considered this to be my sign that it\u2019s time to re-visit the six duchies.When Assassin\u2019s Apprentice arrived in the mail, I yanked out the CD that was currently in my computer, tossed it aside (sorry, Ray Bradbury) and stuck in the first Assassin\u2019s Apprentice disc. My lips trembled as I mouthed the name of the narrator: Paul Boehmer\u2026 Never heard of him. Is he good enough to portray Fitz, one of my all-time favorite fantasy characters? And\u2026 my stomach twisted\u2026 will Fitz be the same boy I came to care so much for so many years ago?Within minutes I was reabsorbed into the world of FitzChivalry Farseer, that insecure, lonely boy who has so much potential but, due to his illegitimate birth and his peculiar abilities with animals, never gets what he deserves. Fitz was just as I remembered and Paul Boehmer portrayed him (and all the other characters) beautifully. (Except that at one point he incorrectly used the word \u201cprisoner\u201d instead of \u201cpoisoner.\u201d)Robin Hobb\u2019s prose was as nice as I remembered, too \u2014 straightforward and simple. It never calls attention to itself (and therefore away from the story). Her characters are engaging and nicely portrayed, though a couple of her villains are overdone. Her animal characters are especially notable and, though I\u2019m not a dog lover, I can\u2019t help but be emotionally connected to Fitz\u2019s canine companions. My second read also gave me a greater appreciation for Hobb\u2019s world-building as I encountered tidbits of information that are relevant to her later works (TAWNY MAN, LIVESHIP TRADERS, RAIN WILDS).My only disappointment is that I don\u2019t have the next book, Royal Assassin, in my hands yet. I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m so eager to torture myself again with this story because I know what\u2019s going to happen. Things don\u2019t always go well for Fitz. His story is heart-wrenching, and I know I\u2019ll be emotionally drained after I finish it. But I\u2019m going to love every minute of it.Read more Robin Hobb book reviews at Fantasy literature."}, {"userName": "James Lafayette  Tivendale", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10282461-james-lafayette-tivendale", "userReview": "DNF @ 30% - twice.

So many of you have been telling me to try these books aaaaand you were right - Robin Hobb is a great author.So really did enjoy this book in the end, but it was definitely a slow start. That was fine, though, because the world was so detailed and I loved the main character! Fitz is a truly wonderful narrator. This seems like one of the better high fantasy worlds I've found. And even though the story was slow-moving, it was never truly boring. More like... peaceful and pretty?

Am I going to like it? Will I give it a fair chance? Will others opinions cloud my judgement? I will admit, Robin Hobb wasn\u2019t on my list of top authors to read, but I found the complete Farseer trilogy at a resale book store and decided to pick them up. I hadn\u2019t read a lot of reviews before starting this book, and the ones I did were either great or DNF. This only fueled my apprehension, but I was in between book series and I had already bought them so I decided to give it a go. It didn\u2019t take long after staring Assassins Apprentice for all of those worries to melt away. Robin Hobb has woven a tale that has all the feels of a great classic fantasy.This is a coming of age story about our main character and story teller FitzChivalryFarseer, or as most refer to him as the bastard. Nobility in the land of the Six Duchies give their children a name that they hope befits their personality. Fitz is the bastard son one of these men. None other than the king-in-waiting Prince Chivalry. When Fitz is discovered Prince Chivalry gives up his position as king-in-waiting and moves to an estate in the country to live a life of solitude with his wife Lady Patience. Fitz is taken to Buckkeep by Chivalry\u2019s right hand man Burrich to live in the shadow of King Shrewd and the court.Since Fitz is a bastard he is not given a position in the court. Instead he is the keep\u2019s stable boy and Burrich is the stable master. He is seen as an outcast and treated as such by almost all those that know who he is. Fitz\u2019s life growing up at Buckkeep is remote and tortuous for a while. His only escape is going into Buckkeep town and playing with the kids there. They don\u2019t know who he is, so he feels a sense of freedom among them that he can\u2019t get back at the castle.The story gets more and more interesting as Fitz gets older. His relationships with Chade (Assassin), Lady Patience (His father\u2019s wife), and Galen (Skill master) were the most entertaining to me. There is also the Fool who pops up every so often to give Fitz some crazy or morbid warning. Also, Prince Verity, Chivalry\u2019s younger brother and now king-in-waiting, becomes closer with Fitz near the end of the book. With all of these influences Fitz is constantly struggling to figure out what he wants to become and what is expected of him. This made him an easy character to empathize with, and helped me enjoy the story even more.The last 15% of the book was probably my favorite. Events finally move away from Buckkeep and Fitz joins a royal caravan to the mountain city of Jhaampe. He has finally been given a mission by King Shrewd, but when he arrives the situation is not what he has been told. This was the most exciting sequence of events, because Fitz is finally on his own having to rely on his wit and training. There was only one thing I didn\u2019t agree with in the conclusion, but I won\u2019t ruin it. Hopefully, this will be taken care of in book 2.Overall, this was a solid and enjoyable read. This is no grimdark fantasy by any stretch of the term, but it does have a dark feel to it at times. The pacing is slower than most fantasy I have read, but it does gain momentum after a while. The payoff was definitely worth the effort put in. Robin Hobb has made yet another fan. I have already started book 2. 4 stars ****"}], "description": "Young Fitz is the bastard son of the noble Prince Chivalry, raised in the shadow of the royal court by his father's gruff stableman. He is treated like an outcast by all the royalty except the devious King Shrewd, who has him sectetly tutored in the arts of the assassin. For in Fitz's blood runs the magic Skill--and the darker knowledge of a child raised with the stable hounds and rejected by his family. As barbarous raiders ravage the coasts, Fitz is growing to manhood. Soon he will face his first dangerous, soul-shattering mission. And though some regard him as a threat to the throne, he may just be the key to the survival of the kingdom.", "title": "Assassin's Apprentice\n      \n          (Farseer Trilogy #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18626895-assassin-s-apprentice", "average": 4.15, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1476397035l/18626895.jpg", "reviews": 6983, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/25307.Robin_Hobb", "name": "Robin Hobb"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7430.Michael_Whelan", "name": "Michael Whelan"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/34748.John_Howe", "name": "John Howe"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18626895-assassin-s-apprentice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45107.Assassin_s_Apprentice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77197.Assassin_s_Apprentice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21956219-assassin-s-apprentice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/892317.Assassin_s_Apprentice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12479382-assassin-s-apprentice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25300963-assassin-s-apprentice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22012758-assassin-s-apprentice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26834413-assassin-s-apprentice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25300956-royal-assassin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33396914-assassin-s-quest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68488.Fool_s_Errand", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45108.Fool_s_Fate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45109.Golden_Fool"]}
