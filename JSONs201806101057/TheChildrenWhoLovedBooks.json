Here is a delightful story about a family that loves reading so much, that even though they don't have a TV or a car or even a house (they live in a small old fashioned trailer), they do have books, lots and lots of books, piled here, there and everywhere. But when the day comes that there are so many books they don't fit in the house anymore, the family realizes it is time to do something.The books had to go. But once they were gone, things change. The table wobbles, there's nothing for Angus to stand on to look out the window, then Mom and Dad and Angus and Lucy notice there is a lot more space between them and they are growing apart. Until...Lucy brings home a library book and the space between everyone grows smaller and smaller as they read the book.Carnavas says there are two themes in this book. First, the theme that we don't need a lot of material things to be happy. This is very true. The second theme is that books can bring people together and that make you happy. Think about reading to your Kiddos before bedtime. It is a close, somewhat intimate moment between you both. Maybe you talk for a minute about the story or maybe about the day, they may even open up and talk about something that is bothering them. Either way, if you were brought closer together by the daily bedtime story routine. And that can be just the beginning, thanks to books.And Carnavas reminds us, we don't have to buy and own books to be happy, we can just go to the library like Lucy and Angus and Mom and Dad end up doing.The boldly colored, whimsical illustrations, also done by Carnavas, are done in watercolor and ink, and are rather fun. Somewhere in almost all of the illustration there is the family's calico cat and roosters. The Children Who Loved Books is a wonderful, charming homage to books, reading, book lovers and libraries! And it is sure to become a favorite with all like-minded folks, young and old.The book is recommended for readers of all ages.This book was purchased for my personal libraryThis book was originally reviewed at Randomly Reading"}, {"userName": "Carrie Gelson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7296879-carrie-gelson", "userReview": "All homes need many books!

Lucy and Angus\u2019 family is poor without a TV or a car, but they find everything they really need in books. But there can be too much of a good thing as they find out when their little trailer home just won\u2019t hold any more. So they get rid of all of the books and clear out their tiny home. But things aren\u2019t the same. The books that had taken up so much space also made the space between the family members smaller. Then one day, a book falls out of Lucy\u2019s backpack and the magic of reading happens all over again.There is no move to hide that this book is purely about the joy of books in one\u2019s life and the positive impact that reading together can have on a family. Carnavas lets his message stand strong, which has positive and negative results. A more subtle approach would have been more satisfying, yet the bold message lets you use the book with younger children.Carnavas\u2019 illustrations are filled with stacks and piles of bright colored books. The family is clearly poor, but also clearly functional. The morning after they return to reading, the family is stacked on top of one another in a tiny couch. The quintessential image of a family coming closer together from reading.Warm and cheerful, this Australian import will have book lovers smiling. Appropriate for ages 3-5."}, {"userName": "Penny McGill", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7033258-penny-mcgill", "userReview": "Can't remember how we came across this delightful picture book. The title alone would have been a good reason to put it on hold but I don't think that was the cause... In any case the illustration style reminds me a bit of Quentin Blake - might be the shape of their nose and face - and it is bright and welcoming. This family doesn't even live in a house, they live in a caravan and it is a sweet spot with all the cute convenience of living in a small space.The title tells us that these kids love books and they are absolutely everywhere in their little caravan. The big excitement comes when the piles of books are removed and the family discovers that the space left behind leaves them bereft. Their father discovers a school library book in little Lucy's school bag and they cuddle around it. One library book leads to many more and the final pages of this wonderful book has Lucy guiding her family (along with their cat and pet chicken)to the local library branch.

(How can you ever have too many books, after all?) Once the books have been removed, there is too much space in their house--that is, until a book brings them all together again. Since their love for reading has been rekinded, they head to the library, demonstrating that you don't have to own books to enjoy reading. I like how the love of books is celebrated here through the text and colorful illustrations, and the reminder that plenty of books are available at the local library is a good one."}, {"userName": "Monika", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58463291-monika", "userReview": "Peter Carnavas to jeden z moich ulubionych tw\u00f3rc\u00f3w obrazkowych ksi\u0105\u017cek dla dzieci.
