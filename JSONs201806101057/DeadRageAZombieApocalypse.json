NO monetary compensation for this review or time has been provided. The opinions expressed in my reviews are my own.Nicholas Ryan has struck again with his enveloping novel, \"Dead Rage\". Similar to the writing styles of Max Brooks and Jeremy Robinson, his books engage you with such visual descriptions that you feel as if you're right there, alongside Steve Bannon, running for your life, smelling the decay of rotting flesh and feeling as if your world has descended straight into the bowels of Hell.\nQuote:\n\"Bannon opened the throttle on the big diesel engine, setting the long-liner for the next wave the way a rider gathers a horse before the jump. 'Mandrake' took the rise bravely, her timber frame shuddering as the snub of her bow cleaved through the swell like a blunt axe. A burst of white water detonated against the wheelhouse windows and went surging back along the open deck.\"And similar to Robert Kirkman, Nicholas Ryan spares no one, and you never know who is going to die, live or just be horribly betrayed by life in general. Mr Ryan puts his characters through hell, and back again. I felt as betrayed by him as some of his characters felt in the book. But in Zombie literature, no one SHOULD be safe. Or else it wouldn't be true post-apocalyptic fiction!Amongst the notes I made along the way, aside from the above quote, as an example of his vivid imagery, Nicholas Ryan creates characters that, for one of them, used only one word and already had me voting for him to die horribly. Lastly, I find it interesting that the undead in his novels have eyes that \"seethe with hatred\" - instead of the eyes being blank, dark, or hungry. I particularly loved that description and tone because it gives them an even darker tone, which I had thought impossible. That one word gave me chills... and I love Nicholas Ryan for that.Again, I was offered this in exchange for an honest review and this is my honest, unbiased opinion: Buy this book, and the two before it. They're well worth the read and will have you begging for daylight to come back."}, {"userName": "Literati Literature Lovers", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13992137-literati-literature-lovers", "userReview": "Once again as with all of his books Nicholas Ryan not only tells a story he draws you into it with his extraordinary attention to detail. From the sights, sounds and locations this story takes place you experience every word.Dead Rage begins with a slow and steady build that not only gave me the chance to visual the characters but also allowed me to gain a greater sense of their emotions and thought processes. Some characters I bonded with immediately and others left a sense of unease.As the story progresses so does the intensity and once it starts it never stops. Never knowing what was coming next, who to trust, the truth from lies only added to the storyline which moved with a rapid fire pace. The words erupt upon the pages and you feel each and every one of them pulsating through your entire body.The magnificent detail written into this story is done so with spot-on perfection. The terrifying and at times horrifying images are explosive. Adrenaline pumps through your body which only heightens and magnifies this extraordinary story of survival.Dead Rage was a thrill ride, a perfect mixture of terror, horror, dead, undead and expecting the unexpected. Heart-pounding and exhilarating I could not put this book down.Nicholas Ryan was the first zombie/horror author that I read. While reading his three exhilarating and thrilling books I found a love for all things dead, undead and the fierce determination of survival. Along with that he has opened my eyes to other authors who write within this genre. Max Brookes and D. J. Molles are two of those authors. While the genre is the same each author adds their own unique flavor to their stories. If you enjoy Nicholas Ryan\u2019s books I think you will enjoy Max Brooks and DJ Molles as well.Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book directly from the author.

Sorry about that.This is a wonderful continuation of A Zombie Apocalypse. This story just continues to captivate me, I really hope that we never actually do have a zombie Apocalypse, cause reading Nicholas Ryan's books terrify me. Nicholas has such a way with writing that it just pulls you in and makes you feel as if you are there observing everything in person.With this installment, we have Steven Bannon who comes home from his fishing job to find the world as he left it is not ever going to be the same again. There are ghouls and everyone he once knew in his small town are after him for his flesh/brains and what have you. Now that's a way to go! (NOT!)It seems that the government has been able to actually cut off the effected areas along that coast, in an attempt to contain the zombie virus. the problem, they still don't know what to do about it, other then contain it.So while the government is trying to find a cure or something to end this. Steve is only really concerned about what happened to and where is his wife.Now there's a mystery for you, she isn't at the apartment, her car is in the parking lot, she isn't found anywhere, so what has become of her?Well now, I am not going to tell you, you will have to read it for yourself. Be sure to hold tight, its a rough ride getting through this one.Love it, and cant' wait for more zombies.thanks Nicholas for allowing me to read this for you for a review."}, {"userName": "Stacie Morton", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22378817-stacie-morton", "userReview": "Wow!! Nicholas Ryan has done it again! I absolutely LOVED this book! Just like with his previous 2 zombie novels, Ground Zero and Die Trying, this one hooked me with the first sentence and took me on a fast roller coaster ride! The plot was fantastic and the characters were amazing and SO REAL! Nicholas Ryan is such a talented author, he has a way of writing that draws you right into the book, as if you were right there with the characters! This book was terrifying and so frighteningly real! Definitely not for the faint of heart! There were many plot twists so I never knew what would happen next and this story was definitely original, one of a kind! I feel that Nicholas Ryan is absolutely in the same class as other zombie authors such as Max Brooks, D.J. Molles, and D.A. Wearmouth! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves horror and/or zombie thrillers! Thanks again for a great thrill ride Nicholas Ryan, I can't wait to see what you have in store for us in future books!"}, {"userName": "John Podlaski", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3772926-john-podlaski", "userReview": "\"Dead Rage\" by Nicholas Ryan is the first book I've read from this author. It starts out slow - five crew members on a fishing trawler are heading back to their home harbor filled with tons of fish to sell. The seas are incredibly rough, crew members anxious and arguing over trivial things; Captain Steve Bannon tries to keep the piece while navigating through the heavy seas. All communications ceased a couple of days ago leaving everyone to surmise about the reasons and length of time before everything is restored. Something wasn't quite right! When they are able to see land, they find their entire town destroyed and in flames.The action picks up when the ship docks at the main pier, crew disembarking quickly to seek out family and loved ones. It is here that they encounter the first zombies - uncertain as to what happened to these people, the crew members learn quickly that these former living beings are extremely dangerous. They soon learn how to kill these creatures, but at the expense of losing two of their own mates.Capt. Bannon is intent on finding his wife and sets out toward home; Sully accompanies him and together they fight their way across town. These zombies are relentless in their pursuit - untiring, hungry, strong and fast - intently focused on capturing their elusive prey. Mr. Ryan has a gift in his ability to use words to flesh out clear and concise mental pictures for his readers, almost as if he had lived through this experience and is writing from first hand experience. Readers will encounter twists and turns throughout the story - at times leaving us with mouths agape. Dead Rage is a story of hope, betrayal and revenge - the ending will be satisfying to all! My only criticism of this story is the authors' overuse of both \"corruption\" and \"Incredulously\" - resulting in a slight hesitation on my part until I climbed over these obstacles.. I look forward to reading \"Ground Zero\" and \"Die Trying\" as other reviewers have praised them.John Podlaski, authorCherries - A Vietnam War Novel"}, {"userName": "Amanda Ivy  Valori", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32784746-amanda-ivy-valori", "userReview": "*I was given an ARC of this book and this review is my true and honest opinion*I never thought I would enjoy a zombie novel in my life until I opened Dead Rage. From the minute I started reading I knew the storyline was going to be spectacular and of course scary. Nicholas Ryan takes you through the life of the main character Steve Bannon, skipper of a fishing boat and worried husband searching for his wife in his hometown that has been infected with Zombies. Of course, there also has to be a sub-character that you just have to hate or just wished would be bitten by a zombie just to shut him up, and that was John Sully. The character flow and interaction throughout the book was consistent and worked perfectly. You were taken from one scene to the next smoothly, never questioning \"what just happened?\". The amount of details that was written, personally had me feeling as if I was living in the moment, as if I was Bannon himself. Dead Rage was and is real in the sense that you can see each and every zombie as if they were in front of you. All the gross, gory, horrible and scary details you could every imagine are in this book, and I must say had me looking over my shoulders. Don't get me wrong, this book is not your typical zombie novel because when you least expect it Mr. Ryan throws you a curve ball that has you in that state of Awe and Wow. I enjoyed every unpredictable twist and turn that was written, and it kept you wanting more. As a person never really into the Zombie/Horror genre but reading Dead Rage, Mr. Nicholas Ryan has completely turned me into the biggest fan this genre could have. If you like other zombie books like World War Z by Max Brooks or The Remaining series by D.J. Molles, then Dead Rage is a must read and has earned a 5star rating from me."}, {"userName": "Mark Allen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16248423-mark-allen", "userReview": "The zombie apocalypse genre is an (over)saturated marketplace and would likely survive just fine without Nicholas Ryan...but there is no denying the literary world of the walking dead is significantly improved by his talented presence. He is quickly--and deservedly--becoming one of the go-to guys for gory, gruesome zombie goodness.Sift through the \"shelves\" of e-book retailers and you'll encounter a veritable tsunami of zombie-themed titles, but what countless authors in this crowded genre fail to grasp is that zombies themselves are rarely interesting enough to hold readers' attention. Strange as it may sound, zombie stories should not be about zombies, but about human drama in the midst of a zombie outbreak. Nicholas Ryan understands this concept far better than most of his contemporaries. In \"Dead Rage,\" we are bombarded with savagely violent scenes of grisly zombie action, but the story is really about a man who will risk anything to rescue the woman he loves. It is this anchor of human emotion that transforms a solid zombie thriller into an excellent one, a formula that Mr. Ryan is rapidly mastering.But fear not, gore-fiends, this is scarcely a 3-tissue Harlequin Romance. Zombies are brutally blasted with breath-taking regularity, making this an extremely action-packed novel, and if you go berserk for blood, you'll find yourself whipped into a joyous rage here. (My personal favorite was the zombie-meets-boat-propeller sequence.)Bottom line, what you get with \"Dead Rage\" is a high-quality concoction of decay, emotion, gore, tension, action, thrills, conspiracy, twists ... and yes, zombies. Lots of 'em. You'll be hooked."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1342527-jill", "userReview": "What you will find in each book by Nicholas Ryan - suspense, gore, shocking turn of events, heart-pounding action, attention to detail, and a book that does not disappoint. He does all of what is listed and plenty more in Dead Rage.Ryan has the ability to bring you in from the very beginning. The sensory detail that Ryan creates to engage the reader from page one literally hooks you in, and you won't be able to put the book down. His ability to paint such a clear picture for the reader is brilliant and will terrify you at the same time.Characterization is a crucial component of how Nicholas Ryan produces a compelling book. Rather than tell the reader directly, Ryan often indirectly shows what a character is like through action, mannerism, thought, behavior, and way of speaking. His dialogue throughout Dead Rage was true to a fisherman's lifestyle. In addition, he creates good vs evil characters. Characters that you are rooting for and those that you despise. He creates complex characters that are alive and believable.Ryan challenged himself with Dead Rage and since I have read all of Ryan's books, I appreciate that as a reader. I don't want to read the same formulated book over and over. I look forward to the next action-packed novel that Nicholas Ryan creates. I know it will be a guaranteed great read!"}, {"userName": "Rae Bradford", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30888050-rae-bradford", "userReview": "Nicholas Ryan knows how to deliver the most frightening and horrific roller coaster ride with his amazing ability to pull the reader into his books with just his words. Dead Rage was the wildest, scariest, and most heart-pounding roller coaster I have been on in quite some time! Throughout the entire book I felt as if I was sitting in the front car with a zombie right beside me! From the very beginning of the book I found myself on the edge of my seat, gripping the pillows with one hand, and holding onto my tablet with the other. After reading the book and thinking about what I was going to say for my review, the one thing that kept sticking out to me was the way the story was written. Yes, this book is scary. Yes, the story has all the elements of a great zombie book\u2026 better yet a great zombie movie!! But what really amazes me about his writing is that even though he is extremely descriptive, his writing is very fluid and you find yourself moving through the story as if you were there living every moment described. When you first meet Bannon and his crew you will have this overwhelming feeling that things are never going to be the same! And they won\u2019t be! You will live what they lived, feel what they felt, and then question yourself if you will get out alive!

The terror and confusion of the unknown, the fear for the safety of those they held dear. It was heart-breaking.This was a fast, but well-paced read that saw the final two men fight for their lives to get out of the hell they found themselves in, only for them to be tossed into a darker more personal hell, where secrets and lies could no longer be contained.As I read this book I found myself glancing over my shoulder every now and then. There were some really eerie moments throughout this book \u2013 moments that kept me on the edge of my seat, as the tension built and all hope dwindled.

You want an 'on the edge' book, a book with raw Grit, scenes that will suck you in, writing that makes you feel the story is more real to life than anything? Dead Rage is the book for you! Jeremy Robinson and Nicholas Ryan are the ULTIMATE zombie/horror writers for me, Nicholas has me gripped for a white knuckle roller coaster ride from page one. His writing style is more descriptive with each scene, and brings the story more to life. With Bannon and the crew heading back from a fishing trip what they stumble upon changes everything, with the town and there families gone it leaves them fighting for there lives, with plots, twists and turns this book is worth each 5 star.

I am quite a wimp with the more descriptive scenes and may have had to skim a little bit over these lol But I really liked the story! It definitely has you on the edge, wondering what's going to happen next and then there's parts that you just don't expect either! This is so well written, really hooks you into the story, following Bannon as he takes on everything that's happened to his town, as well as a personal betrayal to deal with!

He's written a book so enthralling that I forget to be terrified despite his amazingly descriptive style. The key to enjoying a horror book for me is to almost forget the horror with the story and then, to suddenly be up to my eyeballs in ugly, scary nastiness. Nicholas Ryan has done just that with this story of a horrifying epidemic that hits on the east coast while local fisherman are miles out to sea. The story does so much more than just show you the horror. He takes you on a ride with more twists and turns then I ever expected.
