I was just in awe with this book! Also I love the character development. I just wish that Bob had a bigger part in the series.I just love Bob! The books so far seem to get better and better.The villains are varied and enjoyable, and pulled from fairy tales and legends. They include mean plant monsters, psycho fairies, pixies, unicorns and more.Harry Dresden, professional wizard, has practically become a recluse since he lost his girlfriend. A little less than a year ago, his girlfriend was bitten by a vampire. Although he retrieved her--incidentally setting off a war between the vampires and wizards--despite desperate attempts to help her that drive him into near psychosis, he can't restore her humanity. But when the sky starts raining toads and the White Council of Wizards comes to town, Harry is forced to snap out of his misery and self-loathing. The wizards aren't thrilled about the war Dresden set off, and decide that the best way to end it is to throw Dresden to the vampires, unless he solves the case brought to him by a terrifying new client: Mab, Queen of the Unseelie Fey. To stop himself from becoming a reconciliation gift to the vampires, Harry must solve the murder of the human champion of Summer and prove that Mab is innocent of the crime. With only a band of teenage werewolves, a pizza-loving fairy, and his friend, Lt. Karrin Murphy, to help him, Dresden must solve the crime before the fairies go to war with Chicago as ground zero. And of course, that's when things start getting complicated: an old flame pops up on his doorstep, begging him for help, a changeling girl has gone missing and Harry's guilted into taking the case, and there's a killer ghoul--not to mention a chlorofiend (plant monster)--out for Harry's blood. Harry is in for a wild, fantastic, and above all, entertaining ride."}, {"userName": "Philip", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30863291-philip", "userReview": "2.75ish stars.I hope no one's offended if I call this series a guilty pleasure. :) There's finally some semblance of a coherent plot and as a result this is the best book so far.

Harry Dresden is no doubt one of my favorite fictional characters. Witty and crazy will always be a perfect match.This novel was about faeries, and thrones. I really enjoyed how Butcher portrayed both. I've never read anything faerie related so I had no background knowledge of them. Based on the first three novels, Butcher is known for putting his own twists in the supernatural creatures. He makes them his own, and it works most of the time. I like his portrayal of the faeries, and it makes me want to read more of them. Main reason would be to know if he made his own shit up again, but also because he made them sound so damn interesting in the first place. This fourth installment in the series was face paced and consistent. I can't remember any slow points in the middle of the novel. The characters were great as usual, with an addition of a few new great ones. There were good and bad faeries, and both were great characters. I was not expecting to like faeries more than ghosts, but Butcher made them seem so cool. While the third novel was better overall, the creatures in this novel were a bit better.4.25/5 stars. While it was such a fast read because it was so enjoyable, I was still a bit disappointed with the ending. I didn't find it phenomenal, but honestly I haven't read a good ending written by Butcher based on the four novels I've read of his. But aside from the ending, there's nothing more I can complain about. This series keeps improving. If you haven't started reading this series yet, then you're missing out a lot."}, {"userName": "Heidi The Hippie Reader", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-hippie-reader", "userReview": "Harry Dresden, a wizard-for-hire, is in the thick of it.

But since you inadvertently started a war between The Red Court of Vampires and the Wizards there doesn\u2019t seem to be any way to get around being stuck in the middle.I think that Jim Butcher is getting better at writing this series. While I\u2019m still not a huge fan of Harry specifically I like most of the side characters enough that it doesn\u2019t matter. Plus He has a lot of great situations that I loved throughout:\u2732 - Meeting Ebenezer who is like a father to Harry. I liked him immediately.... \u201cYou\u2019re the last one I would expect to be telling me to get involved in Council politics.\u201d Ebenezar scowled at me. \u201cOh?\u201d \u201cYeah. In fact, the last time I checked, you told me the whole swill-spouting pack of lollygagging skunkwallows could transform one another into clams, for all you cared.\u201d\u2732 - Seeing Billy the LARPing Werewolf again and seeing how much his little pack has changed.\u2732 - Meeting Mab and all the other Fae Queens. I do love me some time if Faery and every part of meeting the Queens was fascinating.\u2732 - Clandestine meetings at the Super Walmart late at night where Murphy really got to shine. This is the Murphy/Harry combo I was waiting to see.\u201cBesides. You were lucky I was there. The way I count it, I\u2019m the one who put on the boots.\u201d A smile threatened my expression. \u201cYou did what?\u201d \u201cPut on the boots,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI put on the boots and kicked some monster ass. I dropped the ghoul, and I\u2019m the one who rammed a chain saw through the head of that plant monster thing. Crippled the ogre, too. What did you do? You threw a can of Sterno at him. That\u2019s barely an assist.\u201d\u2732 - Seems like Harry\u2019s old flame found him accidentally on purpose again. Man Harry has shit luck with women. Seriously he is awful with them.\u2732 - BOB!!!! Nuff said\u2732 - Lea, Harry\u2019s faery godmother. Well she was at least helpful this time around and less \u2018I will turn you into one of my hounds\u2019 \u2732 - CHANGLINGS \u2013 \u00bd Fae/ \u00bd Humans. I love the introduction of this into the story. \u2732 - and last but not least a big shout out to Toot. That fairy is hilarious and helpful. Plus he loves him some pizza so I\u2019m sure we would get along.While it is a great compilation of situations I think JB still has some plotting issues. Everything is a bit garbled at times and I actually would have liked the story a bit more if the bad guy ended up being someone else in the story. But these are so much fun and the humor is getting a lot better, along with all the additional characters. I\u2019m definitely seeing why this series has such a big following.

No, the series are still not going in my list of favorites, nor are they getting a 5 star rating (only time will tell), but my level of enjoyment jumped from -50 to +100. WHAT I LIKE NOW - The Narrator of the audiobook is probably one of the best ones I've ever heard! He fits Harry perfectly, and his voice variations and acting are superb! I could practically feel every emotion coming through his voice, truly amazing! Not sure why I wasn't a fan in the first two books.- Harry isn't horny all the time anymore! On top of it, he has become a very likable, compelling and 3-dimensional character! HUGE IMPROVEMENT!- Plot, pacing, writing style, world building - a hundred times better... in the first half. Second half kind of lost me.- HUMOR IS SO GOOD!WHAT I DON'T LIKE- Still not a huge fan of the whole crime genre in general. I just find police investigations, interviewing numerous suspects, etc. kind of boring, but the book DOES try to balance everything out and I managed to remember more than half of the characters...except for their names. Dammit, I need to start taking notes...- The book feels looooooooong and not in a good way. - Second half was...alright. Not bad, but I expected so much more based on how much I enjoyed the first half.A LOT of books are influenced and inspired by the Dresden Files and I am not surprised. That was the main reason why I kept giving the series a chance... That, and the cool-looking dude on the covers. I am super grateful to Jim Butcher for inspiring awesome authors across the world and for never complaining when other series copy elements from his. On the opposite, he was always very supportive and agreeable, which is super rare and speaks volumes for his character.CONCLUSION:If you didn't like Storm Front (aka. Book 1), but you are wondering what the whole hype is all about, then you might want to skip a few books. Based on personal experience, you won't miss much and you don't need the first three books in order to enjoy the sequels. ( I barely remember them).Happy reading!Click here for full resolution."}, {"userName": "TS Chan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan", "userReview": "3.75 stars.According to fans of the series, this is where the Dresden Files supposedly start to get better, and I won't disagree as this was quite an improvement from Grave Peril.The plot in the last book felt quite haphazard. Moreover, the character development of Harry, as intriguing as his backstory is concerned, annoyed me as he seemed to be able to ever 'dig deeper' into his power reserves from out of nowhere, powered by rage or something else which escaped my comprehension. In Summer Knight, we see Harry having to rely more on his friends and other interested parties to assist him in saving the world, which was no less than what exactly Harry had to do. With his adversaries being the super-powerful, omnipotent Faeries, there was absolutely zero chance of Harry being able to take them down based on his raw power alone. The worldbuilding piece around the intricacies and politics of the Fae courts was the highlight of this book for me. Without much knowledge about the Fae, except from watching True Blood and speed-reading a couple of Sookie Stackhouse novels, I was necessarily intrigued. Sufficed to say that the Fae are deeply mysterious, dangerously alluring, wholly otherworldly, and absolutely fascinating. Another interesting facet was that of the White Council, whose judgment Harry had to face after the precipitous events with the Red Court of the Vampires in the previous instalment. From this plotline, more interesting characters surfaced, namely Ebenezar and the Gatekeeper, whom I hoped will have more appearances in the future. As far as characters are concerned, Agent Karrin Murphy has improved in my estimation of her. The delicate balance of toughness and vulnerability emanating from her was handled very well and I can finally say that Harry is indeed lucky to have a friend like her. The same can be said of Billy the werewolf - a worthy and loyal sidekick to have by his side. Dresden Files does seem to keep improving and this is a great volume, but I'll still be hardpressed to call it amazing. Notwithstanding, sometimes one just needs a book that is a bit lighter and easier to digest with decent storytelling. This series has so far been able to fulfil that.This review can also be found at Booknest"}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Some Fairies, Puck, Oberon, Rob Anybody, Tinkerbell, Rumpelstiltskin, and Jareth gather in the Never Never to play Dungeons and Dragons and discuss Jim Butcher\u2019s 2002 Harry Dresden novel Summer Knight.Puck: Jareth, has anyone ever told you that you look like David Bowie?Jareth: I get that all the time, you have no idea.Puck: So what do you know about the fourth Dresden book, Summer Knight?Rob: We dinna know anythin'!Tinkerbell: tinkle!Rumpelstiltskin: I liked it actually, plenty of action, some explanations of the Fairy lands in Butcher\u2019s Dresden world building, very entertaining.Oberon: Indeed, the knave Butcher is no dunce with the pen.Tinkerbell: tinkle tinkle tinklePuck: Very interesting take on the series, Tink, so are you saying that Butcher\u2019s fourth excursion with Harry Dresden is a jump-the-shark play for better sales among the urban fantasy crowd or was this an ambitious harkening back to magical origins?

And I am still kind of in love with Harry that has those fabulous manly man qualities in him that makes him act like a man instead of creature that has been castrated by feminist quenching. There is just something when a man notices a good cleavage, needs his cold showers and has qualities to drive a woman crazy - in good as well as in bad.Harry reminds me of Anita Blake. Whereas Anita is always in trouble, getting almost killed and having sex with her guns, Harry is often in similar situations minus the guns. I love him being so miserable around all the women messing with his heart, and it kind of makes me want to hug and kiss him better while at it.Awww, the best kind of.Summer Knight has strong fantasy elements, the world building takes the front seat and leaves the typical kind of PD touch on the background. It is good development, but at the same time I do miss the spirit of the first installment. Summer and winter fighting, wizards playing the naughty game, vampires and other creatures silently being near the main plot. I enjoy the chemistry of Harry and Murphy, I dig the glimpses to Harry's past, especially when that past comes back to haunt him.Still quite a fan of this series, but would not recommend to readers who do not enjoy slow pace in their fantasy reads."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788446-hannah", "userReview": "That was so much fun! I wasn't convinced about this series before - it was nice enough to read but Dresden got on my nerves so bad with his white knighting and his deciding who gets to know what and who is capable of protecting themselves (hint: women aren't). But this time around I really enjoyed it, very much so. A lot of that enjoyment comes from James Marsters' absolutely brilliant performance that lend Dresden a humanity and humility that I didn't see before. The voice work fits the character brilliantly and I cannot imagine a better person to read this story (I love Buffy a lot, so that probably helped). I will definitely listen to the next books instead of reading them and I am so glad I discovered the audiobook.Still reeling from the events of the last book, Harry Dresden is at his absolute worst, a mess, when he gets sucked into a war between the two Fairy Courts. As usual, the odds are stacked against him, but this time around he actually accepts help and I appreciated this. I think that this was the best story yet, as Dresden is finally learning from the disasters he lived and is becoming a much better person to spend time with as a reader. I love the world Jim Butcher has created here with all the different kinds of creatures with different moralities (or none) and different cultures. It feels real and lived in and vast in a way that I really appreciate. Lately I have been enjoying Urban Fantasy more, as genre I struggled with in the past, and I am so pleased with this - because there are so many books in this series and I love being abl to spend a lot of time with characters I have grown fond of."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/621240-paul", "userReview": "Before I start gnawing on the book, let me first say that I enjoy Butcher's writing overall. He does good character, a romping pace, and makes me care about his protagonists. In fact, Butcher's a good enough writer that he enters the \"good enough to realize his mistakes, which makes it so frustrating when he misses them\" category. So...yes...he's quite good.But....This is definitely the lesser of the 1st four books. I'm muchly bothered by the severe escalation of the power scale in this book, as Harry is now immersed in an all-out war between faeries that threatens to change the very fabric of reality. This goes a LOOOOOONG way towards Dresden entering the class of the Not Very Special At All...which is something to be avoided.And Dresden's habit of being in way over his head got a little tedious, especially as the character kept actually talking about being in over his head too many times, and how it would eventually mean his end. Yes...it would. And when I'm on the 40th or 50th instance of \"Dresden only has a one-in-a-thousand chance of survival!\" I start to wonder about the man making those odds, and I also start to yawn. And when Dresden puts down Yet Another Foe Against Whom He Has No Chance, I start to get reeaaalll sleepy. Also......(spoiler alert!!)...........I have been trying very very hard to just enjoy these novels and look at them as fun gothic horror/adventure, and NOT somebody's idea of a kickass gaming night put down on paper, the kind of thing where someone acceded to the wishes of their gamer friends who kept saying, \"Dude! Our campaign mega-rocks! You should write a BOOK about it and make our sweeeeeeet characters FAMOUS!\" That became impossible to do at the end of this book, which ends with....(yikes)....Harry Dresden setting down to a table in an apartment, with a group of young werewolves, to eat pizza, drink soda, and....yes...have a role-playing gamer session. Yep...a wizard sits down with werewolves to have a roleplay session. Awesome. I feel like I'm sixteen again.

He is reeling from the fact that his girlfriend has left him, and she's been changed into a near-vampire by the Red Court of Vampires. He feels personally responsible, and is desperate for a way to help her. This despair has affected him to a deep level, and he's barely functioning, living in a pig-sty, and not even taking cases or taking care of himself. It was very hard to see him like that. And things don't get better for Harry. Because he's facing judgment by the White Council of wizards, who are out for his blood, and he has to prove that he's not a troublemaker or they're going to deliver him signed and sealed to the vampires, who won't sit him down for tea and sandwiches. They'll kill him, and make it hurt. His only way out is to prove his allegiance to the White Council by opening up routes into Faerie so they can get away from the vampires. In order to do that, he has to make nice with the Faeries. Luckily, or unluckily, the Winter Queen Mab shows up at his office, 'asking' his help to solve the case of who killed the Summer Knight, thus stealing away some of the Seelie's Court's power and upsetting the power balance between Seelie and Unseelie Courts. Trust me, that's not a good thing, and could very well lead to the end of the world. By asking Harry, that means he doesn't get to say no, since his faerie godmother sold his debt to her to Queen Mab. Complicated? Yes it is. But that's par for the course for Harry.Harry Dresden doesn't get it easy. He just gets it not as hard, sometimes at least. Life for him seems to go from one battle to the next. And he has plenty of battle-scars. But, he doesn't give up. He keeps on trucking. I couldn't love him more for that. Harry is at his snarkiest in this book. The man's mouth is a sharply-honed instrument, and he knows how to use it. And, he shows that he's definitely an alpha male, with his take charge, 'try to stop me' attitude, despite his endearingly self-deprecating manner. He might seem like a ne'er do well, but he's resourceful, strong-willed, and at heart, definitely a white knight.Summer Knight wasn't an easy read for me. The print in my book was way too small, and Mr. Butcher has a very descriptive, detail-oriented writing style. But, it was a fantastic read. Mr. Butcher takes faerie and concocts a delectable story around it. I've read quite a few faerie stories, and he still managed to bring some new images and concepts to the table. I love what he does with Faerie. And I loved the Faerie smackdown at the end of this story. I felt like I was right there, with a ringside seat on the action. I was cheering for Harry and his gang of werewolves and faerie changelings, and wincing as he takes his share of licks. And if you've ever read a Dresden novel, you know that Harry is always, always getting hurt. But, he just keeps on going. Gosh, I love this man!Mr. Butcher really took me on a nonstop ride. I was feeling all Harry's pain. I didn't enjoy seeing him suffering the way he does in this book, and I hope that he does find peace over Susan. Even still, with all his personal anguish, he manages to save the day, yet again, and give me more than a few laughs in the process. It was great to see tough as nails Karrin Murphy, the Chicago Police Detective that he consults on 'weird' cases with, fight at his side against an ogre, chlorofiend (plant monster), and ghoul assassin at the local Walmart.

There were scarlet-and blue-skinned ogres in faerie mail,brown skinned gnomes, sylphs crouched over a mound of bloody, stinking carrion, squabbling like vultures, troop of battered, lantern-jawed, burly humanoids with wide, batlike ears, goblins, clouds of pixies, bumble bees as big as park benches, spiders as big as footballs, faerie hounds to name but a few.

Weird, but good weird. It was weird revisiting the first three books, which I originally didn't like enough to continue the series, on audio for the first time. I knew that James Marsters was a huge part of the reason I ended up liking this series so much, but I don't think I realized just how much until starting this re-read. I liked the first three books more on re-read in large part because I'm invested in this world and these characters now, but it's also just super fun to listen to James Marsters read me stories. He brings Harry to life. Which is all just a lead up to me explaining that I'm reading the rest of this series on this re-read in hard copy, because I have OCD and each book has to be read each way at least one time. I did 1-3, 13, and 15 in hard copy the first time around, so they get the audio treatment this time, and vice versa. And I missed the audio SO BAD. I still liked this though, to be clear. In fact, I liked it about the same amount I did as when I read it in 2010.I still loved the introduction of the Faerie courts, and Harry's relationship with Toot-toot the fairy. I still liked the way this book inched closer towards expanding Harry's circle of people he trusts instead of making him continual loner man. I think I actually liked the stuff with the White Council better this time, now that I have a firmer grasp on what their whole deal is. I can't frickin' wait for Harry to calm the hell down about women, though. When does that happen again? I feel like it's not until halfway through the series, at least.Anyway, it's been two months since I read this, so more detailed thoughts have escaped me. Maybe I'll make up for it in the next one, since I didn't actually write a review for that one the first time through.Original Review, 11/1/2010: Never thought this would actually happen, but I'm giving more than three stars to a Dresden File book. I'm still not entirely sure if that extra enjoyment was garnered by the writing (which I still think is pretty awkward in places . . . Jim Butcher and I are obviously not in agreement about what constitutes \"cool\"), or the fabulously sexy narration of James Marsters. His voice really brought out the color and personality that I felt was missing from the first three books. It also helps that I find fairies infinitely more interesting than ghosts, werewolves, and over the top wizards involved with the Mafia. While still being overwhelming pathetic, Harry also managed not to annoy me at all this book, a lot of which has to do with Marsters, but also to the fact that he's actually letting people help him now and not being so much a stupid martyr anymore. I'm also not going conceal the fact that I very much appreciated the absence of Susan, the vampires, and aforementioned stupid Mafia. Anyway, I enjoyed this book enough that I'm in for the rest of the series, but it's gonna be audiobooks all the way."}, {"userName": "Roy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38117634-roy", "userReview": "I hadnt really like the previous 3 all that much but I was heavily convinced by a friend that I should. I'm glad I did. Great fun, the larger world is explored a little more, characters are fleshed out more. It seemed more together and it feels like Butcher is building towards something. Definitely going to continue with this series."}, {"userName": "Nicholas Karpuk", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1574263-nicholas-karpuk", "userReview": "To reiterate my criticism of the series as a whole: Harry Dresden is a stupid, narcissistic, nerd (nerdcissist?) who's first impulse when it comes to problem solving is to run into the villain's lair and shout \"Who's making all the bad magic!\" and then get surprised when people attempt to murder him.The cover art for all these books, and the casting choice for the television show give me the impression that Butcher views Dresden as a sort of wizardly Han Solo, a roguish figure marginalized by both the human and magical worlds.But anytime I imagine him, he ends up halfway between David Tennant and Rincewind from the Discworld books. He's all stick legs and potbelly, the physique you'd get from eating nothing but junk food and coke, but not enough of either. I'm actually shocked he doesn't eat Cup of Noodles.Here's the thing: Harry Dresden is a well-realized character, he's just a person whose head I don't want to be inside. I don't want to hear his lascivious objectification of every woman every time they enter a scene. It's either how hot are they are, or how more or less hot they are than normal. He's also stubborn the way many real world nerds are, to the point of self-destruction where you want to choke them. Also, in third person I wouldn't have to listen to his rationalizations about how he's so awesome even while being self-deprecating.What's odd is the writing style has improved around Dresden, but the growth of the character is much slower. He certainly says \"Hell's Bells\" with a reduced frequency, but he's about as immature as he was in the first book. The pacing and the action packed set pieces really hold the book together. I nearly stopped near the middle because I simply have no patience for magical political intrigue from writers who don't seem to have that strong a grasp on politics, especially made up fantasy politics. Unless you are Frank Herbert or George R.R. Martin kindly stow that crap whenever possible. So I find myself considering, somehow, reading another Dresden book, since it's an easy read and reasonably amusing despite Dresden himself. But seriously, when is this crap wizard going to grow the hell up?"}, {"userName": "Karla", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3024056-karla", "userReview": "4 Stars! This is urban fantasy, not romance, but I want to jump in the book, lay Harry flat out on his back, and have my way with him! What a yummy wizard! Another stand out installment in this series. A kick-ass plot, lots of laugh out loud moments, amazing world building, and the knowledge that there will be more, more, more! Loved Billy the Werewolf and his crew! Harry can't keep his eyes in his head when the female werewolves get naked...naughty wizard! James Marsters as narrator, makes this book come alive, one of the best audio voices out there. He nails it every time. His voice is a combination of rough, sultry, snarky, amusing, everything that embodies Harry Dresden's character. James Marsters you are music to my ears!"}, {"userName": "David Sven", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8802423-david-sven", "userReview": "Another solid entry in the Dresden Universe. James Marsters as audio narrator has really come into his own since the first book to the point where I can't imagine anyone else being the voice of Harry Dresden. His rendition of other characters and creatures has just improved out of sight as well.The pace of this book took a bit of a hit compared to his previous books, with a large chunk of the middle taken up with a lot of dialogue and world building. We learn a lot about the fairy courts. And I mean more than what we've learned about the vampire courts and white council in the previous three books combined. So far, in the previous few books, we got the world building on the fly without sacrificing pace or plot elements. That meant each book was light on world building, but cumulatively each subsequent book continued to build the lore and add details as we went. This book however, the pace takes a very noticeable pause. I have to admit, my attention was starting to wander for a bit there. Fortunately, in the last couple of hours Butcher really brings it home where all the action re heats up and it was worth it in the end. I felt the world building element was over heavy for this book on its own, but if combined with the books so far, then I have to say the Dresden Universe is really starting to fill out with some real depth developing. I'm trusting that in the context of the series as a whole this book has added some good material to contribute to the continuing story and world building/lore elements.Anyway, this story continues some nine months after the events of Grave Peril. The vampire Red Court as you can imagine is none to happy. Not only have they got contracts out on Harry but they have also gone to war with the White Council who are also none too happy with Harry. He's in a lot of trouble. In the meantime he has a murder to solve before all out cosmic war breaks out amongst the Fairy Summer and Winter Courts that threatens all sorts of nasties like an extended ice age or global outbreak of Ebola - things like that.So grab your sword cane and your blasting rod and prepare for Faerie-geddon. And don't forget Harry's warcry as you enter the fray -\"I don't believe in faeries!\"4 stars"}, {"userName": "Jody McGrath", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31857555-jody-mcgrath", "userReview": "Another great Dresden book but not as good as the rest.

I first read this book years ago and liked it then as well but I probably liked it a bit more this time around. This series is up to full speed by the time you get to this book and I just love Harry and the world he lives in. This book was fast paced and really exciting. I actually found myself wanting to listen to it for hours at a time which made it a really quick listen.Harry starts the book out in a bad place. Things didn't end well for him in the last book and he has spent months locked away trying to find a solution. Then everything gets really interesting. He realizes that he needs to get back in the world and earn a little money just as he receives a visit from Mab, a Fae Queen. The White Council is in town trying to pin the current war on Harry so he has plenty of things to keep him busy.I really liked seeing the growth of all of the characters. We have really got a chance to get to know most of the characters well by the time we make it to book four and they have been through a lot. And it shows. Harry wants to keep everyone safe and takes it personally if anyone experiences harm on his watch. Karin opens up to Harry a bit at the beginning of the story but it was really fun watching them fight together later in the story.I loved the narration! This is a book that I think listening to the audio version is a completely different experience. James Marsters is the perfect choice for this series and really makes Harry come to life. The delivery is perfectly paced with the occasional insertion of a well placed sigh. I really almost felt like I was a part of the story as I listened.I would recommend this book to others. This is the fourth book in the series and I do think that the series should be read in order since each installment builds on the previous books. I can't wait to start the next book as I work my way through this series for a second time.Initial ThoughtsI never seem to get tired of this series. James Marsters once again does a phenomenal job with the narration."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "I loved this book to, but then I loved all the Dresden books. Everyone and everything ends up at stake here and unlike so many books where \"the fate of the world hangs in the balance\" this one stays an absorbing page turner throughout. You can't help but feel for Harry, the poor schmuck usually manages to get the proverbial \"snot\" beat (yes I know it should be \"beaten out\" but we're going colloquial here) out of him, before the end of the book. Sometimes the amount of punishment he takes is (as Bertie Wooster might say) quite astounding.The Harry Dresden books are what first interested me in the actual genre of Urban Fantasy.These are great books...really.
