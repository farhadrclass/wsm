Ben and his two great loves. Neither is better than the other and neither is stronger than the other. Just different. Different, but equally perfect and fitting for Ben.__________________________________________This is a review for both Something Like Summer and Something Like Winter since I don't see a way to talk about one without the other.\n\u201cWhy couldn't people's insides match their outsides? The world would be such a wonderful place if the nicer someone was, the more beautiful they became.\u201d\nI really don\u2019t know where to begin with this review. Both books have left me with such high emotions that I\u2019m still sitting here quite speechless. I can tell you this, when I started I was expecting a cute little coming of age tale. Ha! Yeah right. What I got was beautiful, heartbreaking, wonderfully written story that left me a blubbering mess. One that is on my mind and will continue to be on my mind for days. In the beginning of both books we meet Ben, an out and proud teenager, and Tim, a boy who is still trying to figure himself out and how he fits in the world. When they meet they start up a secret relationship because Tim, having to worry about his social status, can\u2019t very much be seen with the local gay kid. Yeah, whatever Tim. The boys become closer and their relationship turns into a sexual one which then leads Ben to wanting exclusivity with Tim. Tim is still young and still scared. Scared of his own feelings, of his parents\u2019 feelings, hell, he\u2019s basically scared of the world. So he ran. In Something Like Summer we have the story told through Ben\u2019s POV. Ben had just been left by his first love and is in pieces. Pieces. With me right along with him. He is forced to move on and move on he does. He has a few boyfriends but he eventually finds love again with the ever-perfect, Jace. I loved Ben & Jace\u2019s story. Even though Ben never stopped loving Tim and he is still a very real presence in Ben\u2019s life, Ben & Jace\u2019s relationship felt just as real and was wonderful to witness. Jace was everything Ben needed and deserved after his massive heartbreak. Jace was understanding, forgiving, loving and just completely there for him. Like I said, perfect. In Something Like Winter the same story is told through Tim\u2019s POV, but it didn\u2019t feel as though I read the same story twice. They first 20% or so was Tim & Ben\u2019s relationship they had in high school and it was interesting to read what happened in Tim\u2019s eyes. Let\u2019s face it, it was going to take a lot to redeem some of Tim\u2019s actions. Yes, Tim was redeemed but no, his actions were not excused. Not only did Tim break Ben\u2019s heart but he tore his own into pieces by running. Right along with my heart. After he realizes his mistake, it\u2019s too late. Ben has found someone he loves and deserves, Jace. Tim thought his life was over after Ben and struggles to get it back. He floats through life; he finds some successful relationships and some very damaging relationships along the way. His story was the most heartbreaking for me, he was so broken and so lost. Nobody to really love him except his best friend, Eric, but I really can\u2019t go there right now. Still too many emotions running wild! But, eventually, he was able to put the pieces of his life back together. Not for Ben but because of Ben and the love they still had.Throughout the 10 year or so span of these books Ben & Tim touch each others lives, coming in and out for brief moments but they were never able to find the right moment to be together. Well, in the end they finally found their moment. And it was beautiful.Oh my, this was so emotionally intense I cried like a little baby in both SLS and SLW. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve cried like that while reading since Dobby died. You know what I mean. Yeah, that kind of cry. I was happy, sad, devastated, heartbroken, hopeful, just every emotion hit me, BAM! over and over again. Next up is Something Like Autumn where we get to read Jace\u2019s story. It\u2019s ready to go on the Kindle but I still need some time to mend my heart before picking this story back up."}, {"userName": "June Helmsley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8164744-june-helmsley", "userReview": "Holy Fucking Shit!That's what this book should be retitled, or maybe that can be the subtitle. I don't know, I'll get back to you on that. Either way, it needs a lot of exclamation points because Holy FuckSandwich does this book kick so much ass.When reading fiction, it bothers me when I don't care about the characters, or even worse, a goddamn contrived love triangle that bores me when it should interest me. Not here! I was so emotionally invested in these characters that I lost my shit when bad things happened to them. Seriously, I cried. Twice. And I never cry. When I told my roommate Amy Kennedy about that, she started accusing me of being human and having feelings and shit but after SHE read this book she was all kinds of touched by it too. So who's the human now, bitch?!!?Here's a gist: Ben is obsessed with Tim. Tim and Ben start a careful romance, but Tim's not out yet and he's kind of a jerk but you feel for him so it's sort of okay. The years go on and they go their seperate ways, and Ben meets up with this awesome guy named Jace and everything seems okay but then Holy Fuckdoodles Tim is back! Normally I despise love triangles but in this it feels so real! It kinda reminded me of the Luke and Noah and Reid thing on As the World Turns, which I never would have fucking watched but then I caught clips on YouTube and got addicted and stayed up one whole weekend watching it. I lost my shit with those guys and thanks to SLS I lost it again!What's nice about this book is that everything that happens to these characters feels believable, and you can empathize with them and the decisions they make. Also, no vampires, and these days, that's a plus.I know I'm rambling, but I think Amy mixed up my pills or put an extra shot of B12 in my smoothie this morning because I'm screaming at the screen as I type this!

THIS is why I'd never want to relive my teenage years.All that doubt, wondering, alienation---Ugh. Ben is a great narrator. At times, you want to cringe and others cheer, but like life, it has its ups and downs. To know something about yourself at a young age that makes you significantly different is an experience that isolates. Growth is different, changed and lonely. Ben's early teen years came with a harsh lesson. Not all epiphanies lead to happiness. But like a good sword, it gets stronger with each fold and hammer blow. Ben doesn't falter. His resilience is admirable and he's so far ahead of others in his personal growth that he has no confidant to share his hopes, dreams and desires--except for his best friend, Allison. Allison is the consummate friend who will support you, cheer you, and tell you when you're an idiot or fuck off when you've screwed up, but in the end they're there. I liked that there was a good give and take to their friendship and not everything had an easy solution. And let's face it, they have serious disagreements about Tim. Tim. We all had one of these at some point, the elusive, unreachable, ungettable get. Ben is goofy and awkward and squeezes his way into Tim's life--as barren as it is. Ben is the best thing that's ever happened to Tim and he can't accept it. Heart ripped out #1.Sucks, but first loves are like that. Reboot. What happens then is Ben's journey to find love. Real love. The kind that is proud, never hides, and surrounds you like a blanket--Jace. Talk about wonderful. Fucking love Jace so hard, and so does Ben. But, the past doesn't always stay in the past...Heart ripped out #2--bad choiceHeart ripped out #3--I don't want to talk about it. Took me three days to even think about writing this review because of it. Maybe I'm a masochist, but I liked this story. I liked that there was a slightly non traditional trajectory with some realism. At the end, part of me felt like we got to eat our cake and have it, too. It's just a bittersweet cake.

Haven't cried over a book in a while...now I need something funny to read...(A couple days later): After being unable to write more than the above for a review, being so overwhelmed, I've decided to make my reply my review :-)\"I wasn't expecting anything like this. From the description, the cover and the beginning I thought that this was just going to be a light YA read. Not at all. It was really compelling in the that it examines idealism of the past and the the resultant impact upon one's present when one can't let go, ideas of alienation and self-acceptance, of dependence and self-love, of maturity, evolution, compatibility and why, of inexorable attraction and its effects, of fear and freedom, and seeming fate. It was such a powerful read for me hereby.The last third of the book has a swifter pace than that which precedes it and some reviews I've read said that people found it to be rushed....I can see how. But I find it to be strong all in all.\"I would definitely read work by this author again...after a suitable interval though, with some light stuff in between.

A person can find happiness in different ways, but there is a right time and place for everything and every action has consequences. Life doesn't stop, it just continues around us and our choices shape the way our life continues, even if we would like it to go into another way. There are mistakes and regrets, but if we spend all our energy trying to re-capture a moment that is already gone, refusing to move on, we might get stuck without energy to admire the beauty of what may still lie ahead of us. While it may be understandable to wish we could edit our mistakes, we have to accept even the moments in life we feel went wrong and follow where our actions lead us.There are so many different ways this novel could have played out with different timing, different decisions (for example whether or not to forgive indiscretions, whether or not to admit truth, whether to let fear or love rule us, whether to use our heads or little heads). It felt like a real story with very interesting characters as they navigate their lives :) I can recommend it without reservations :)"}, {"userName": "Alvin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25537239-alvin", "userReview": "[Jace would die or something.

I picked up Something like Summer (twice actually not realizing my blunder) because I was drawn to the bright orange of the cover with that bit of blue that caught my eye every time. One Sunday, when I was stuck in bed I wanted a book to bring my spirits up so I started this. What happened was me being sucked into a book that I did not stop reading until I was done. Ben, what a strong character at such a young age. I wish that my children could have the sense of self that he does. I felt his \"not stalkerish\" crush on the new boy with the blue running shoes. I wanted him to be noticed, I wanted the new boy to SEE Ben and fall head over blue shoes for him instantly and I wanted this to be a story that would knock me on my butt. Did it ever!I love that this book spans a decade. There is beauty to a slow burn in romance that does it for me. Sure, insta love is also fantastic but this story wouldn't work that way. Ben and Tim, Tim and Ben. Good Lord. Let's just say I loved being in Ben's head and when he asks Tim to say something to him in Spanish I thought my heart would explode. I looked up the translation before Tim explains it and I melted. It was beyond beautiful and heart wrenching and stunning and, Le Sigh. There are at least a dozen or thirty moments that were like that for me. Tear my heart out why don't ya Jay Bell?!Now, I was not prepared for the road this story took but I love where it went. Seeing Ben grow and change and fight the instincts of a love sick teenager were gorgeous. Jay Bell certainly knows how to weave a story that sucks the reader and and it he did that with me. Let me just say that Tim was fantastic. I never once thought he was selfish, absent or mean when it came to Ben. When I found out that he was getting his own book I immediately went and one clicked that bad boy. I had to know what was going on in his head during this time. All this time. Ugh.Something Like Summer a roller coaster of a read with an intense climb into adoration followed by a swift down fall into love...for me that is.

When it came to this book, I was so excited to read it. From the blurb, I thought this would become a fast favourite of mine. The blurb wasn't really the best thing to go by, and that was what I did go by. Not the reviews, (I didn't read any before I read this) but the blurb.From the blurb, I got the impression that this would be about Ben and Tim. And that was true, to a certain extent. But in all honesty, I found it hard to like any of the three characters. I hate love triangles, and this was one of the biggest ones I have ever read. There are many reason I don't like them, and one of them is because of what happened in this book. Ultimately, one of the characters has to go away, and I didn't feel the way it happened in this book.The book spans a decade and while that would normally be a great thing, I found it to be kind of hard here. The author is a great writer, I am not faulting him at all. But the story was not for me, at all! I think a lot of my GR friends know about my taste and this happened to have a couple of my pet peeves. But I have my taste and it's my own fault for not reading actual reviews before reading this book.There were some things I liked... YA is a genre I love, so that boosted it. The beginning of the book wasn't bad at all. I didn't love it by any means, but at the same time, I didn't hate or dislike it. It was the best part of the book for me, which is different to other reviews. But I am a sucker for high school stories, and for a time, that is what this presented as. A high school story.Not the most emotional book in my opinion, but for someone who really loved the characters, it would have been. I am giving it three stars because of the writing and the beginning of the book. I can't give it less in my opinion, but I will say, if your taste is similar than mine, I wouldn't recommend this book."}, {"userName": "wesley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36179338-wesley", "userReview": "This is the first M/M YA book that I\u2019ve read and I cannot be grateful enough that I did read it because it has helped me come to terms with my sexuality. Being born in a country where both the state and the church have forged ideals of what should be the norm, being gay included, has forced people like me to hide deep in the closet. But after reading this early this year, the entire Something Like Series in fact, and hundreds of M/M books after that, I can at least say that I am now honest with myself. I am gay and it will not change. It\u2019s kind of funny how a series focused on ordinary lives of fictional people can have such a huge impact on your own. Somehow I can\u2019t help but be envious of Ben for having to live an honest life despite the pain and sorrow that went along with it. I can\u2019t help but wonder if there are real people out there like Ben and Tim who are living the life that they\u2019ve wanted\u2026 no, needed. And that is what this series is all about to me. It\u2019s HOPE. It\u2019s hope that there\u2019s someone out there perfect and waiting for me. It\u2019s hope that although not everyone can be happy with who you are, at least the people that actually mattered support and love you all the way. It\u2019s hope that despite the pain and hardships that are sure to come in trying to live a life of honestly, somehow it will all be worth it in the end. And although having to cling to this hope can be dangerous, I cannot let it go.

However, three things absolutely ruined it for me: 1) the sudden death of Jace, which seemed entirely too coincidental; it should have been foreshadowed at least a little bit; 2) Tim's douchebaggery increased exponentially as he got older; it was kind of understandable during the first part of the book (easily the best part), but convincing your ex that his current significant other cheated on him, just to get into his pants afterwards is NOT OKAY; and 3) Ben, too, grew more and more unlikeable; at first, he was just a cute little nerd, but then he became more and more annoying as the story continued. The random subplots about Allison's father was incredibly out of nowhere, as if they were tacked on at the last minute to add even more drama.

Also swearing.HOLY FUCK, was that frustrating. You know, I thought I'd hit off Pride Month with a cute, heart-wrenching gay romance. Well, think again. Instead of cute, I got creepy. Instead of heart-wrenching, I got head-banging on the table. Almost every second page I just had to pause to cool down. At some point I actually thought it would get better now. HA HA HA no. It just got worse. I thought this would be a cute romance. Instead Ben is fuCKING CREEPY, almost stalking Tim. He doesn't know ANYTHING about him, other than that he is hot , but still he walks past his house at least TWICE A DAY??? Also, Tim hangs out with the bullies from his school, so apparently he isn't the nicest guy, but still, when Ben accidentally causes him to sprain his ankle, he offers to nurse him for two weeks. He starts to skip school and neglect his family, to nurse a guy he doesn't know shit about, hoping it'll lead to sex, despite Tim repeatedly mentioning that he's straight. Let's be real, you only have to add the sentence \"until one day his obsession takes a dark turn\u2026\" and you have a premise for a FUCKING PSYCHO THRILLER. But of course Ben's dreams come true and the two of them actually start a relationship. Only problem, TIM HAS NO FUCKING PERSONALITY. Not only that Ben is a whining creep, but Tim is also uninteresting as fuck. Dear Jay Bell, how am I supposed to care about this relationship when I couldn't give less a shit about either the MC or the love interest? Honestly, we don't learn anything about Tim. Even know after finishing the book, the only thing unrelated to Ben that I know about Tim are that his parents are shitty af and that he paints. THAT'S IT. Throughout the book, Ben repeatedly is asked what he likes about Tim and his answer always is: 'There's more to him than his looks.' But he never really establishes what. Also, FUCKING CHEATING. Tim is in a relationship when he and Ben start to hook up. I don't care that Tim doesn't care about her, that doesn't make it okay. He is in a relationship, that's all that matters. But we'll get back to cheating later, because foreshadowing, BEN IS A CHEATING SHIT.Oh and this quote: \"Why are you even with her? You never have anything nice to say about her. She doesn't put out; she's not even the prettiest girl in school.\" smh I have a lot of problems with thisalso from reading US high school themed books and watching US high school themed movies one might believe that every single high school jock is an asshole - Idk about you but I have sporty friends and they're actually pretty niceNow, remember that I already don't like neither Tim, nor Ben, not to mention their weird ass relationship. Then this happened: Ben wrote a gay-themed poem for his school paper, which gets published. Without his consent though, the teacher changes it into a heterosexual poem. Ben is understandably furious. His reaction though is so stupid and unnecessary. He goes to the journalism room to confront his teacher, but finds it empty. For some reason Tim shows up and then encourages him to trash the whole room, including the dark room. Like, why???? I get that he is angry, I really do, but why the fuck does he have to resort to violence? The other students of the journalism course seem to be the only ones that are nice to him in school and now he goes and fucking destroys all their creations?? That's such a dick move. And he doesn't even feel bad about it? In the end he admits to doing it, but only to save Tim's ass and he even says, he doesn't feel bad about it, because it feels like they made some sort of romantic memory together, Bonny and Clyde style, WTF??? I'm already so done with these two assholesNow let's skip forward. Tim's and Ben's relationship doesn't work out and Ben moves on. He meets Jace and the two of them start a relationship. Now, Jace is a freaking SAINT. I'm not saying this on a positive note. It's frustrating. Look, Ben and Jace are together for quite some time and they are COMMITTED. But someday Tim shows up and Ben starts meeting up with him. He knows he still has feelings for him, but tells himself nothing will happen. BUT HE FUCKING KNOWS HE HAS FEELINGS FOR HIM LIKE IT'S SO RUDE TO JACE. He eventually tells him and Jace is like, well sucks but it's fine and they even all go out together. ??????? what. Of course, Ben and Tim end up making out BECAUSE CHEATING IS SUCH A FUCKING COOL THING TO DO and Jace finds out and you know what he does? NOTHING he's like well first love and all, it's hard to get over that, but Idc WHAT. Also remember how I said Ben was close to a stalker in the beginning? WELL APPARENTLY TIM LEARNED FROM HIM BECAUSE HE IS SO FUCKING CREEPY AND INNAPROPRIATE he just shows up to Jace and Ben's house, makes a lot of sexual jokes, even though Ben told him he is in a relationship and most of all HE MADE ONE OF HIS FELLOW STUDENTS TO GO TO THEIR HOUSE AND SLIP A NOTE THAT BASICALLY IS SUPPOSED TO BE PROVE THAT JACE IS CHEATING ON BEN ALL SO THAT THEY BREAK UP AND BEN GOES BACK TO TIM I'M NOT KIDDING AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT WORKS BEN AND JACE KIND OF BREAK UP AND BEN GOES BACK TO TIM well eventually Ben finds out that Tim was behind his note and I KID YOU NOT HE ENDS UP WITH JACE FUCKING AGAIN AND JACE IS JUST LIKE IDC I LOVE YOU LIKE HAVE A SPINE YOU IDIOT I hate all three of them at this point And know, the most stupid thing is yet to happenBen and Jace are happy again, they even marry and them JACE FUCKING DIES YESHE JUST FUCKING DIESAND THAT'S NOT EVEN IT TWO YEARS LATER BEN AND TIM GET BACK TOGETHER EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER FOR TWO FUCKING YEARSJUST LIKE THAT I'm so done with this shit I'm not even going to talk more detailed about the ending, it isn't worth my time The only thing that sooths my anger is when I imagine how Tim and Ben, after having their big moment, suddenly realize that they have nothing in common anymore and it's just fucking awkward and they just sit next to each other in silence because honestly I get that you will always have a special place for you first love, but like no one can tell me that after TWO YEARS OF NO CONTACT you can just get back together without even checking first if you even still like each other it's so stupid"}, {"userName": "DaisyGirl", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7028003-daisygirl", "userReview": "5.0 StarsWow. Just ... wow. I. Am. Beat. In Something Like Summer, Ben tells us of his first love (Tim), his second love (Jace), and his life in between. It was riveting. I enjoyed the characters and the overall storyline. I loved Ben's indomitable spirit and optimism. Tim was sexy as all get out but ... well, you know. (If you don't, read this book!) And, lastly, Jace ... *sigh* I love, Love, LOVE Jace. Period. This book wrung me out. I laughed, I cried, I threw my Kindle, I cried some more. In the end, I was blissfully languid. Out of it.

Unfortunately I didn\u2019t particularly like the main character in Ben but in many ways this is completely subjective. He happened to touch on a few personal pet peeves that are unlikely to bother other readers, although the issue of fidelity may be a problem for some. The writing though is very engaging, bringing you into Ben\u2019s journey with an absorbing intimacy. Although this isn\u2019t a fast paced read, it\u2019s a story I didn\u2019t want to end. Jay Bell\u2019s second novel is a contemporary tale of a boy looking for true love. Told in third person from Ben\u2019s perspective the reader follows the intrepid hero as he finds his first true love in high school. Tim Wyman is a new arrival from exotic Kansas and Ben is in lust at first sight. After Ben tackles Tim in a daring rollerblade accident culminating in a broken bone and enforced intimacy, the two begin a friendship with romantic undertones. Although Tim comes a long way to accepting his relationship with Ben, Ben\u2019s outgoing personality and refusal to hide his feelings end up being too much for the closeted jock. Over the next twelve years Tim comes in and out of Ben\u2019s life leaving confusion, longing, pain, need, love, and an everlasting connection. This is mostly a character driven story that is sometimes funny, sometimes heart breaking, sometimes infuriating. The main character of Ben is well developed and incredibly complicated. He\u2019s full of flaws and issues, an interesting mix of boldness and cowardice. I experienced a wide range of emotions from loving Ben to really disliking him to not quite believing in him but still wanting a happy ending. Ben is anything but cookie cutter and he engages readers while also potentially turning them off. He often makes mistakes and rarely wants to take responsibility for his created problems. In fact from beginning to end, Ben doesn\u2019t really change much from the slightly immature, act first think second bold teenager. In some ways Ben is the example many teens likely wish they could be. Totally comfortable with his sexuality, out of the closet at a young age, Ben adapts to the challenges thrown his way. He refuses to let his love put him in a closet or change who he is. Ben shows astonishing maturity during his first breakup with Tim, a maturity markedly lacking upon later meetings. The reasons are many and varied as the story tries hard to show that love is complex, messy, and never easy. Ben\u2019s love for Tim never, ever goes away and this is offset by a lengthy relationship Ben has with his partner Jace. The love triangle between Ben, Tim, and Jace \u2013 although sorry, no threesomes \u2013 is honest, genuine, and rather frustrating. This is where I started to really dislike Ben in many ways. He\u2019s human and ultimately flawed in many ways so it\u2019s not very surprising when Ben makes all the wrong choices. Ben\u2019s best friend Allison is often used as an outside voice of reason. Allison is incidentally a great character but used in very obvious manipulations. Allison only really exists later in the story to prompt Ben into actions and decisions. I really wish she hadn\u2019t been used as such an obvious prop and instead given more subtly as she is quite enjoyable in scenes. Yet even with Allison\u2019s influence Ben willingly and knowingly makes mistakes. Part of this should make him a likable and relatable character. Unfortunately I found Ben to be frustratingly immature. He continues to make mistakes and refuses to accept responsibility, preferring to run from the situation. In some ways he shows shocking maturity and self awareness. Yet at the same time he makes the most obvious and juvenile mistakes. This mixture creates a very complicated character but one that is not always likable. Not only that I couldn\u2019t quite understand why Jace is so understanding and loving about everything from lying to infidelity and even Ben\u2019s obvious cowardice. Supposedly love is the reason but this feels too easy. However I acknowledge that\u2019s my own personal pet peeve in stories and other readers may not have this same issue. While the infidelity is handled very well and with an honesty that is to be commended, Ben\u2019s own refusal to own up to his actions is what killed him for me as a hero not so much his confusion and the actual actions themselves. Although I don\u2019t think this is a huge spoiler I\u2019ll warn anyone to stop reading right now if you\u2019re worried. One of the major plot points of the story is that Tim and Ben end up together. I don\u2019t consider this a spoiler since the blurb explains the story is about the decade long relationship between Tim and Ben. So knowing this,I think the resolution between Ben and Jace is horribly manipulative. It\u2019s an obvious way of getting Jace out of the picture so Ben and Tim can continue their relationship with a clear conscience. While romantic I suppose, I think Jace as a character deserved better. Again personal taste and other readers may feel differently. Overall Something Like Summer is a beautifully written, engaging story that does an excellent job of depicting flawed men as they struggle through life. The honestly shown is very vivid from the confusion of love to trying to find a direction in life and working through the tough times in a relationship. This is an easy story to read although not an easy journey for any of the characters. It\u2019s a novel that is likely to resonate with readers. Although I had a few qualms I think these are highly personal and other readers may not have the same issues. The clean writing and editing is a delight to read and the showing tone helps create an even pace to the story. You simply won\u2019t want this story to end."}, {"userName": "Wade", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6085305-wade", "userReview": "I read this in 2012, and the review below is for the ebook I read.In 2016 I listened to the audio and then decided to re rate it to 5 stars. I think because this book made me yell at the characters for their choices. When I'm so emotional invested that I'm yelling at the characters, for me that's should be 5 stars.I think the difference is in audio. I LISTEN closer to the story when I'm listening than reading. When I read-only I read slow, and sometimes I skip things. I'm not a very good reader, but as a listener I pay close attention to every word. This is a great book. I own it in every format and I WILL buy the movie. Highly recommended. Note i need to listen to the other Something Like stories because I really am an audio girl!!From 2012: I am really excited for Jay. It is like \"living the dream\" for all those authors out there! Self-pub, to best of 2011, to \"going to be a movie\". Jay is an inspiration to perseverance and true talent. I look forward to reading his work. :)4.5 starsThis was really hard to rate. On the one hand I wanted to give it 5 stars because I really loved \"part one\". Ben and Tim's relationship was fun and believable and I think very well written. Then\"part two\"... I ended up liking Ben and Jace. I think they were good together and the relationship worked. Then mix the two. I was frustrated and angry and wanted to give the book 4 stars because of Ben's stupidity. But men are stupid sometimes. The men in my books do stupid things too. Can I hold that against Jay for writing truth as he sees it? No. Sometimes characters do stupid things. It happens. Even id I didn't like it. I think Ben made some poor choices and I felt bad for Jace. I think he deserved better at times. Then the inevitable happened... (of course we know something has to because the book is about Ben and TIM!) I didn't like this either. I felt it coming, so as far as predictability that is where the .5 stars went. We all know I like to be surprised. Over all, this was a great book. Actually a terrific example of how to write details. Jay was terrific at details. Plus, for having loads of sex it was all tasteful and was a good example of how to write sex without explicit detail. You don't need it! Jay did a perfect job there.I was expecting more emotion from myself, though. I hardly got years in my eyes at all. I did laugh, but maybe I was going on the hype built up around this one that I felt I missed something when I didn't roll on the floor and I didn't cry my eyes out. Hmmmm. Something to consider. I will re read, but more to learn how to write better. (for myself) Jay writes well.Thank you Jay for writing it. I look forward to the movie! And to reading more of your stuff."}, {"userName": "Sheri", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7300331-sheri", "userReview": "First love. Maddening love. Everlasting love. This is a story of first love. High school ignites sparks between Ben and Tim. Ben wanted Tim, stalked him and craved him like no other. Tim shocked Ben with returning the desire. Tim was ashamed of his feelings for Ben, he hid them and asked Ben to keep their relationship under lock and key. Ben was willing to do anything for Tim, his love for Tim burned brightly, so he complied. It didn\u2019t take long and Tim broke under the strain of his secrets. He was cowardly and weak and he deserted Ben, ran from him and the love he couldn\u2019t handle. (ok, it\u2019s no secret, I am not a fan of our friend Tim) Time passes and Ben moves on, but the smoldering passion and love Ben has for Tim never burns out. Ben.I found him completely maddening. He had potential, great potential. I saw it simmering underneath. However, I found myself frustrated, annoyed and irritated more than not. Surrounded by an amazing family and his incredible best friend, he had a rock solid support system. He never hid who he was, and always took responsibility for his actions, regardless of the repressions. Yet, he had no control of his emotions. He was a \u2018fly-by-seat-of-my-pants\u2019 act now, think later kind of guy. All logic went out the window with Ben, and it angered me when it affected Jace.TimTim, Tim Tim. *sigh* Essentially Jo Dee Messina sums up my feelings about Tim.\u201cMy give-a-damn\u2019s busted\u201d. Tim was a spoiled brat. A rich kid who\u2019s\u2019 parents bought his love. I am sorry for this, truly I am. He suffered a cold sterile childhood. BUT, it gives him no excuse to take, take, and take some more. Tim is a selfish, spineless jerk. Why Ben can\u2019t live without him is beyond me?Jace.Jace made this story bearable for me. He had me at hello. He was honest, loving, forgiving (oh my was he ever forgiving) and simply perfect. Frankly, I don\u2019t believe Ben deserved his unconditional love. It was NOT equally returned in my opinion. I felt as if it was a story of who loves who more...Ben loves Tim more.Jace loves Ben more.Tim, well Tim loves Tim more.(sorry, I told you, not a Tim fan)Overall, I found it challenging to enjoy. Part one dragged a bit and then part two and three flew by. I know it was critical to set up the importance of their teen romance; it just was not evenly weighed with their adult lives. The tragedy at the end broke my heart. Unfortunately, not enough of my heart was vested in the story for it to do more than anger me.*3 eye-rolling-teeth-clenching-come-on-really? stars*"}, {"userName": "Silk", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54101444-silk", "userReview": "Overall this is about Benjamin Bentley's life throughout the time span of over a decade. I won't get into too much detail 'cause I'd rather not give any spoilers. \"Love isn't meant to be hidden away. Life is too short for shame.\"His story starts out with Tim. His unrequited love which later on proceeded to become dysfunctional love. From the book's description and until I got through the first 100 pages, I genuinely expected this to be a \"high school sweetheart\" kind of story but, oh boy, I was terribly wrong.I've had such intense feelings and harsh thoughts throughout the whole book, from the first few pages to the last ones. Whether it was skepticism, sympathy, hope or expectancy. Everyone feels frighteningly confused at some point in their lives, although I suppose it varies. It can take quite some time to figure yourself out. And come to terms with your life whether it's on a social and general basis or more personal and deep. Ben's story is a perfect example of such development. He learns to handle himself and move on, be devoted and certain yet at times confused and devastated. Well of course, I've had my fair share of cringe thanks to him but that only adds to how real the story felt. \"That's right. Lean into those feelings and let them wash through you. As wretched as they might make us feel, they're a part of us, and we shouldn't ignore them. It only hurts worse if we do.\" I also want to mention Allison, Ben's best friend, because I absolutely adored her. She sincerely supported Ben and their friendship was admirable. The twist at the near-end of the book gave me a serious crying session.
