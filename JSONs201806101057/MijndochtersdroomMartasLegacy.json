It was WONDERFUL! I really enjoyed the first book, but loved this one even more! I was so inspired as I read about how the Lord pulled each of these ladies through the hard times and I cried more than once while reading this book. Not because it was sad (though I was) but because I really cared about the characters. And honestly, even the sad feelings were a healing, rejoicing kind of sad because of the beauty that God brought forth from the ashes in their lives. The title of this book couldn't have been more perfect. At first I thought the daughter who had the dream was Carolyn, but it ended up being Dawn. And what a powerful story she had. I loved how realistically her struggles with Jason were portrayed. I loved how I lived in her head and in her skin for so long. I literally escaped into her world. This author is so incredibly gifted. She does a fantastic job of bringing characters to life, and having her readers join their journeys and struggles in every life-transforming story she writes. This is the kind of fiction I aspire to write myself. Fiction that comes alive, that brings healing, that deals with real-life, painful issues, and that shows the heart of God and the redemption of Christ. What a beautiful story! I dare say that this book ranks at the top of my favorites list for this year. I've read many great books so far in 2010, but this one stirred my heart, challenged my thinking, and encouraged my spirit the most. Wonderful, wonderful book!"}, {"userName": "Marnie  Kr\u00fcger", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6108495-marnie-kr-ger", "userReview": "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.

Francine River\u2019s new book Her Daughter\u2019s Dream is just such a book. But not only does it challenge your own experiences, it helps you see the lives and relationships of those around you in a new light. Mother-daughter relationships seem to be naturally fraught with possible misunderstandings and hurts\u2026 this book actually lends hope that not only are things not always as they seem, but that there is hope for bridges built and understanding blooming. This isn\u2019t a book you can read quickly before jumping on to the next book on your shelf. It is rather one that you have to slow down and leaf back through to think over situations, and one that will likely stay with you long after you unwillingly close the back cover. The characters are so real (based on the author\u2019s own family) that you feel an honest emotional attachment and literally cry with joy, and heartbreak, as the book progresses. Francine Rivers doesn\u2019t tell a story as much as draw you into a world.This is a book to own, not borrow\u2026 but you will feel compelled to lend it! It is, absolutely, WONDERFUL.Thank you to Tynedale for allowing me to preview and review this book!!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2105748-elizabeth", "userReview": "This book picks up where HER MOTHER'S HOPE left off, and continues the family saga into present times. I won't try to relate the plot, but since the chronology of this book was similar to my own life, I could identify with the characters who were impacted by the Vietnam War and the social revolution that took place around that time in history.I will repeat the following from my review of HER MOTHER'S HOPE because it applies to both books:The story has many parallels with the author's own family, and she successfully weaves fascinating, if disturbing, historical facts about the desperately hard life of immigrants (women in particular), especially those on the frontier. As the generations unfold, current events, in the form of wars and social upheaval, impact the characters in ways that many were actually impacted at the time.I had understood that Francine Rivers was a Christian writer, so I was a bit apprehensive about how this would be handled in the book...so often Christian principles and morals are shoe-horned into a story just to make a point. I was impressed that not only did Rivers avoid this pitfall of many Christian fiction writers, she managed to portray characters facing real-life challenges and tests to their faith in a way that seemed real and powerful, without feeling contrived. I found myself being aggravated at one character or another for being so obtuse as to not realize the pain they were causing those they loved, but sadly, this too was probably more real than I'd care to admit. We often hurt those we love most of all. Still, I wanted to knock some heads together.At the heart of it all, though, the plot resolves the worst of these conflicts through forgiveness, courage to admit mistakes, and the healing power of love -- God's love and our love or each other."}, {"userName": "Ritu", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3566685-ritu", "userReview": "This second book following 'Her mother's hope' continues to trace the relationship between mothers and daughters over the generations. I found the book very interesting when I pondered about the friction and hidden messages and nuances that passed between mom, daughter and grand-daughter. Marta's daughter Hildie...Hildie's daughter Caroline....Caroline's daughter May Flower Dawn. The book dwells on how each of these women behaved with her daughter in the best way she thought to do trying not to repeat the mistakes her mother had done. In that process, the mother ended up making new errors of judgement and ended up alienating herself from her daughter. It took Marta her entire lifetime to realize how the misunderstandings could have occured and Dawn's warmth and love to bring the women back together. This book heals relationships and makes one realize how little incidents that may have occured a long time ago, can remain embedded in one's mind and scar, hurt one for their entire life.A great book to read!"}, {"userName": "Jen H.", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4736685-jen-h", "userReview": "I love all of Francine Rivers books and I love them because of the theme that runs through each one of them: God redeems. He takes broken people from broken places and heals them. He makes all things new. This book (and the one preceding it) was a little different kind of book for Francine. This book grew out of her desire to understand the relationships between the women in her own life. She did a good job of accurately portraying the complexity inherent in human relationships and in particular, in the relationships between women. Francine's writing style is interesting to me. She doesn't really go into a lot of detail nor does she use a lot of flowery words and phrases. She simply tells a good story. It's the story itself that keeps you reading. Not the complexity of the plot. Not the \"beautiful writing.\" Just the story. Her books remind me, in a sense, of the children's books we go back to over and over again both as children and as adults. I think people return time and again to Francine Rivers books because we like the stories she weaves. And I'm thankful she's an excellent story weaver."}, {"userName": "kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1429622-kathleen", "userReview": "I liked Her Mother's Hope so much more than this sad story. Dawn develops a closer bond with her grandmother, Hildemara, than with her mother, just as Carolyn did with her Oma, Marta, causing more rifts between generations of mothers and daughters.

Beginning where the first book left off, the reader joins Hildemara as she is struck by tuberculosis and forced to ask Marta to help with her children. She fights her warring feelings for her mother, thankful for her help but jealous of Marta's closeness to her children. I had thought that Marta was a hard-hearted mother and expected Hildemara to be different. After all, she was a nurse and loved to serve others. However, she is more senselessly cruel to her daughter Carolyn than Marta had ever been to her.I realize that we are supposed to pick up on the repeated mistakes weaving their way through the generations, but the lack of affection that Hildemara showed Carolyn just didn't make any sense. We are supposed to understand that she doesn't allow herself too close due to her disease, but that is no excuse for the complete lack of parental supervision that leads Carolyn to disaster. One of the things that bothered me about this series is that the reader is never shown major events. Taking place over the course of the 20th century, this story (including both books) includes characters who fight in World War II & Vietnam, attend Woodstock, and participate in the cleanup after the World Trade Center attack. The reader gets only vague references to these events and the story never moves to the point of view of the characters involved, unless it is something they mention later. We miss out on world history in favor of once again seeing Hildie do dishes. As with the first book, this second installment has each character making major life decisions without discussing them with anyone, family secrets, and people's inability to say 'I love you' as ongoing themes. Once again, I was astounded at how many pages were taken up with inane topics like high school dating in the 1980s. Let me get this straight, we get a letter about the results of Vietnam, but 100 pages on teenage courtship? The ending was a predictable and unsatisfying happily ever after, though I can't say what ending would have made it worth the 1,000+ pages I've now read between these two books. Rivers gets the family dynamics perfectly, but a little more was needed than that to make this a good novel."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1727656-sarah", "userReview": "I enjoyed this, although not as much as Her Mother's Hope. At times I just felt too annoyed and frustrated by all the conflict that could just be so simply resolved if these women just opened up and said what they were feeling instead of bottling it all up and letting it fester! The women in my family are very much the sort to tell each other immediately and bluntly if they have a problem with something, so I couldn't relate to all the secrecy and repression and found it exasperating, even though in theory I understood why they were all like that.I also felt a bit confused at times because of the four... no, FIVE generations of women involved, especially near the end where it often switched between Dawn and Carolyn's viewpoints and Carolyn would be talking about 'Mom' (meaning Hildemara) and Dawn would be talking about 'Mom' (meaning Carolyn) and I wished everyone could've just used first names. An omniscient narrator viewpoint would've helped.I found Dawn's life quite convincing and thought her relationship with Jason and her parents, her thoughts and her relationship with God were all very realistically portrayed. But the bits about Carolyn's 'wild' phase in the sixties experimenting with drink and drugs etc felt rather vague and cliched -- maybe F.Rivers was just toning it down for her Christian audience? Anyway, it didn't seem genuine to me."}, {"userName": "Rissa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41794459-rissa", "userReview": "Beautifully written and an intriguing storyline that kept me reading. Little bits of information slowly coming out. It was great. The writing is spectacular and from the very first chapter i was invested in Carolyn and her future. I now want to read everything by Francine Rivers. Carolyns mother was sick so instead of the mother daughter relationship she wanted she became close with her grandmother. Carolyn loved her grandmother but once her mother got better Carolyns mother was jealous of their relationship. From then on Carolyn and her morther relationship is strained. As carolyn grows up her family is torn apart further and all she has is her brother Charlie. her older brother Charlie decided he wants to serve in the war and Carolyn wants nothing more then to keep him with her because without him she was alone. But once Charlie leaves and Carolyn leaves for college life is not as bad as it once was. Carolyn makes a friend, shes not the best of influences on Carolyn but she is a good friend a friend that carolyn needed. Theoughout carolyns early years she belived in God and went to church with her grandmother but as carolyns mother pushed grandmother away she also unintentionally pushed God out of Carolyns life. Without Carolyns grandma she was lost and confused and alone for a long while but she made a friend and things started looking up but reconnected with her grandmother or not why would she believe in someone that put they through so much misery. Carolyn has struggles with faith, as i think most do. Whe something bad happens, why does it happen? It can be avoided and fixes without problem for God so why does he hurt his followers so. \u201cIf he loved us he wouldnt have wars and famines. People wouldnt die of diseasr or be born with deformities or mentally retarded. I don\u2019t believe in God anymore\u201d. I agreee with you g Carolyn, why on earth should we believe in soemthing that does all that?!The after a death in the family everything gets worse for Carolyn. With her faith, family, relationships and morals. And thats all within the first 100 pages. Highly recommend this beautiful novel!The book went through 3-4 generations and getting to see each of them grow up and how their lives changed throughout their life was really unique and beautiful.

This book covers the lives of Marta\u2019s daughter and granddaughters. The characters seemed so real to me and the hurts they inflicted upon each other so damaging that, again, I found this book difficult to read yet impossible to put down. Spanning from the 1950s to present day, this book tells the story of Hildemara\u2019s battle with tuberculosis. Because of her illness, her daughter Carolyn forms a special bond with Grandmother Marta. When Hildemara returns to work and Marta leaves, Carolyn is neglected and tries several destructive paths before returning home to her mother. We see the past repeated as Carolyn\u2019s daughter Dawn forms a strong bond, not with her mother, but with Grandmother Hildemara. Finally, as Dawn struggles to avoid the examples of those who have gone before her, she finds a way to bridge the gap between the women in her family. After so long a time coming, redemption of the family history is sweet!I can\u2019t say enough about Francine Rivers\u2019s ability to sweep me away into a story, particularly this story of four generations of women. Her Daughter\u2019s Dream reminded me of a biblical saga, where folks make surprising decisions and choices that somehow are completely within their characters. In this volume, I could better relate to the inner conflicts the characters faced, and I rejoiced to see softer sides of Marta and Hildemara. Upon finishing this story, I was left thinking, How do we ever find peace in our family relationships when we are so quick to judge, control, and manipulate each other? As this book shows, the answer can only be found in Christ. And sometimes, even when we find the answer, it is too late to regain the many wasted years. \nThank God this world is just a stepping stone to eternity. Believers can rest assured that no matter how they\u2019ve treated their loved ones, in Heaven all tears shall be wiped away, and we all shall each receive a fresh start.\nI reviewed Her Daughter\u2019s Dream as part of the Tyndale Summer Reading Program."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1790079-melanie", "userReview": "Her Daughter\u2019s Dream is part two in Marta\u2019s Legacy by Francine Rivers. To fully understand and soak in the story you need to start with part one, Her Mother\u2019s Hope.Part two picks up where one left off in the early 1950\u2019s. Hilde is suffering for a second time with TB and is in a hospital room quarantined from her family. Her husband Trip calls Oma Marta to come and help them so that Hilde can come home to recover and care for the children. Hilde is surprised that she does. Marta and Carolyn form a close bond while Hilde is recuperating, and the relationship between Hilde and her daughter never grows to be the close bond that she desires. Years later Carolyn goes to college and soon after her brother Charlie goes to Vietnam. Carolyn drops out of college to protest the war, experiments with the drugs and alcohol of the hippy era. Still close with Marta, but never having felt loved by Carolyn. She turns from the God she once held dear after her brother is killed in the war. Carolyn comes home after all her options are exhausted, pregnant with May Flower Dawn. The cycle continues as Carolyn rebuilds her life while Hilde cares for Dawn. The relationship between Grandmother and Granddaughter overtakes the one of mother and daughter. This saga is rich in historical data and loaded with well rounded, unique characters. A heavy read about the generational sin of pride and secret keeping. Of not reaching out to the ones you love to make sure that they know you love them. I had hoped that this second part of the story would bring some redemption as the first one left me feeling sad and not at all satisfied.

Rivers continues to weave a story that links you to the characters but also teaches you lessons about your everyday life. Every family has the traits they pass from each generation to the next, sometimes unknowingly and sometimes we choose to pretend to not see what is happening. Rivers tackles these things head on, showing that through generations families can remain disconnected but it does not have to stay that way. Relying on Jesus, we need to let go of our pride and conquer those things head on. The things that tear a family a part do not need to be passed down but repaired, with Jesus there is no reason to let the hurts and pains of one generation to continue on to the next.

I liked this second book less because there were just too many depressing events in Carolyn's life. Surely no one person has experienced that many tragedies: parental neglect, sexual molestation and rape as a child, drug/alcohol abuse, death of a sibling, being homeless and hungry, condemned by a self-righteous preacher when she was trying to turn her life around, and finally the death of her daughter to cancer. I began to dread reading the book for fear of what terrible event might come next. For example, I could hardly read about little Christopher swimming in the pool because I was afraid that he would accidently drown while Dawn was watching him. I liked the resolution and the way it occurred, but I don't understand why Dawn had to die. I would have preferred all five generations reconciled and present at the end."}, {"userName": "Angela R.

This is a very personal story for Francine Rivers. She says, \u201cI wanted to explore what caused the rift between my grandma and my mom during the last years of my grandmother's life. Was it a simple misunderstanding or something deeper that had grown over the years? Many of the events of this story were inspired by my family history that I researched and events I read about in my mother\u2019s journals or experienced in my own life. You may have guessed that Carolyn is my alter ego\u2026but only some of my life is interwoven through hers\u2026\u201d Her Daughters Dream covers a time span starting at 1951 and is brought to 2010. The author describes events in the history of the world, how this family and others responded to Kennedy\u2019s assassination, the Vietnam War, Woodstock, Hippies/Free Love, September 11th and others.The first part of this story is told through Hildemara Rose\u2019s point of view. She\u2019s very sick and needs to ask the help of a person who\u2019s hurt her deeply - her mother, Oma Marta. Francine Rivers quickly changes to Carolyn\u2019s point of view, Hildemara\u2019s daughter, for the majority of the book. Carolyn is a very studious child and is eager to please her parents. Her brother, Charlie,is the polar opposite of her. Carolyn\u2019s life is forever changed by the relationship developed between Oma Marta and Hildemara, when Hildie was sick.Carolyn does all the right things in school and learns how to blend in. But, things changed in high school with Charlie now attending the same school. He becomes protective of her and Carolyn has to learn new rules and how to melt into this new crowd.1968 hits and Carolyn is at Berkley University gathering signatures to help protest the war in Vietnam. Carolyn\u2019s world was changing quickly. Nothing made sense. She didn\u2019t fit in anywhere. She didn\u2019t know what to believe anymore. Where was God in all this war and killing?\u201cGod? They\u2019d all been saying God didn\u2019t care or God was dead. When had faith ever been enough?\u201d Not in Carolyn\u2019s life anyway. Carolyn\u2019s parents, Hildemara Rose and Trip\u2019s world wasn\u2019t the same either- they were both in pursuit of the American dream. They gave their best to the job, there was little time left for family and friends.Then one day Carolyn hears from Jesus and he\u2019s told her what to do, \u201cShe just didn\u2019t think she could do it.\u201dHer grandma Oma said, \u201cNothing is easy Carolyn. Life isn\u2019t easy. We do the best we can with what God gives us.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019ve made a complete mess of everything Oma.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about what you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s about what you\u2019re going to do now...You lived through it. You\u2019re a survivor. The past doesn\u2019t have any power over you anymore\u2026it only has the power you give it.\u201dFrancine Rivers does an incredible job of allowing the reader to get in the skin of each of her characters. I was quickly drawn into their situation and could feel their pain. It was amazing to see the events of our world affect one family and the people around them.  My heart broke for the women in this story and how misunderstandings and the fear of confrontation caused them to be in so much pain when in each others presence. Francine Rivers\u2019 story helped me look at my family and how we weathered events in history and how it shaped and molded us as a family unit and as a country. It showed me that God has plans for us even in the middle of the storm; He wants us to cling to Him and have faith.I loved Carolyn\u2019s favorite prayer, \u201cGod grant me the serenity to accept the things I can\u2019t change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Thy will, not mine, be done.\u201d This is easier prayed than done, but so true.A Daughters Dream is an tremendously moving story of a families struggle to overcome misunderstandings of the past, trust God to help them forgive one another and heal the hurts and have faith to carry them through. Francine Rivers is a master wordsmith bringing God, faith and family together in such an incredibly moving way. This story is personal for Francine and she describes how the characters and the story parallel her personal life and struggles. Get your tissues ready as you read, I found my self weeping at the end for the sadness and joy of one family where God made a tremendous difference.

The very premise of the lack of necessary communication between mother and daughter, the resulting repressed feelings, the lashing out in harmful ways and the overall denial that there is anything essential to confront, became overly redundant for me. In fact, Oma (Marta) reiterated this process herself when she wrote in her journal to the extent that in the effort of one generation to raise the next generation by doing the opposite of what was done before in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes, they end up doing exactly that anyway. For women of four generations, their belief and faith in Christ is what has sustained them through difficult struggles during their lives, yet, each mother is oblivious to notice the emotional pain she is inflicting on her daughter. When this attitude is repeated chapter after chapter, my frustration continually increased and I became more and more apathetic to these principle characters. Additionally, the last quarter of the book seemed to drag on; I sensed the impending need for resolution, but the time it took to get there was almost arduous.On the other hand, the story did illustrate the challenges that some parishioners experience after making grievous mistakes and no longer feel welcome and accepted among their congregation. It equally presented what long-term emotional affects a traumatic childhood episode can continually trigger throughout adulthood until those feelings are properly addressed and resolved. The novel also shed light into what the lifestyle of a war-protesting, alcohol binging, drug addicting, free loving, Haight-Ashbury communal living for a small group of college drop-outs of the 1960s was like, or at least what glimpses of that lifestyle could be later recalled. This help place other things that I had previously read into a more clear perspective and provided some food for thought."}, {"userName": "Gracee ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730201-gracee", "userReview": "Typically, I avoid, like the plague, stories about mother/daughter conflict and eventual redemption.

Gooey sappy, tied up in a bow mother/daughter-huggy-kissy-we'll-exchange-recipe stories MAKE ME CRINGE! That is NOT this story!In this sequel to Marta's Legacy, we find out what happens when people jump to conclusions, keep secrets, and second guess others regarding things that are said, and things that are left unsaid.  Sometimes it's too late to say \"I love you\"..and you simply have to persevere. Francine Rivers uses such common mistakes we all make as parents to weave a dysfunctional family, and how God's love can un-weave it.. how our downfalls and crisis can be used to strengthen our love for God, and for others. Even though we can run away from Him, he will never take us somewhere that he has not promised to love, and shelter us as well. I think this is a wonderful two part series that deals with very real emotional, physical, and spiritual issues, that, even if the reader has not gone through, you have known someone that is or has. Have hankies ready. I found myself crying, not necessarily for the characters and situations, but more for the obvious head-smack of \"GOD LOVES YOU!!\""}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5164907-lisa", "userReview": "The first book had me hooked enough to finish reading Marta's Legacy. Once again, I was interested in the storyline and the characters kept me reading. The writing makes it an easy read and keeps you wanting to find out what happens. Unfortunately, all of the characters in the book seem very stubborn and tight-lipped, at least when it comes to mother-daughter communications. The story focuses on mother-daughter relationships, but the message seems to be more that only mother-grandaughter relationships are successful. I was so upset reading about these women who go decades without talking to each other about the things that really matter. As mothers, they seem to have little to no self-reflection on their parenting techniques. Marta never made peace with her daughter, which was very sad and frustrating to me. The first book ends with her wanting to make things right, but she never followed through on that. Yes, as Hildie is approaching 90 years old, she finally learned that her mother loved her. In my opinion, that is way too late. While the book attempted to wrap things up quite neatly with the arrival of Faith, I found that I was just very sad at how these women wasted their lives by building walls and not even trying to tear them down."}, {"userName": "Casey", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3194216-casey", "userReview": "It took four generations for the hurts and anger and bickering between a family of four women to come to an end. \"Her Daughter's Dream\" continues the story begun in book one, Her Mother's Hope and they should be read one right after the other. Which is what I did. There are so many character struggles in this book. So much heartache, so much learning to be done and through it all I did find myself a bit indifferent. But there were many moments though the book that tugged at my emotions. Both joyful and sad, this books takes the reader through the ringer. Dawn was definately my favorite character. She didn't bow to the mistakes her previous generations had made, though she definately made plenty of her own, but she wanted to change and yearned to change. It made all the difference. But the ending is why I gave the book 3 stars. I don't want to give it away, but I didn't like how it was tied up. I was heartbroken in the end and though it was tied up neatly and I wasn't \"upset\", I was very disappointed in the ending. However, this review is just my opinion and I know many other readers have loved the book."}, {"userName": "Georgia Herod", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2334447-georgia-herod", "userReview": "This is the sequel to Her Mother\u2019s Hope. Carolyn Arundel is Hildmara\u2019s daughter and granddaughter of Marta (Hildie\u2019s mother). Tensions continue to mount between mothers and daughters. Carolyn disappears in the San Francisco hippie scene, but then returns home with her daughter born out of wedlock. May Flower Dawn develops a closer bond with grandmother (just as her mother had done), yet she becomes a bridge between the generations. Rivers captures the complexity of the mother-daughter relationship and how the threads of intense love, misunderstandings, hurts, losses, forgiveness, and sacrifice are interwoven from generation to generation. Often painful, but powerful, to read because Rivers deals with life as it is\u2014hard! These two books caused me to think much about my own relationship with my mother and with my daughter. How is it that we try so hard to do mothering right, but so often it doesn\u2019t have that effect?
