THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING! This is one I happened to pick up as it was sent to my library from the book selector gods (may they ever be so kind). The artwork caught my eye and I decided to take a better look. Best decision I\u2019ve made in a long time.This is a nonfiction book where the author wrote about a black female leader in history and then illustrated a picture of them. I loved reading about all the trailblazing women in this book, some I had never even heard of until I read about them in here. I\u2019m also in love with the author\u2019s illustrations, I immediately went and stalked her on etsy to see what she had for sale.If you have a child in your life, boy or girl, I highly suggest you purchase this book or check it out from the library for them. It\u2019s a book that young readers need to read and experience.Follow me on \u2665 Facebook \u2665 Blog \u2665 Instagram \u2665 Twitter \u2665"}, {"userName": "MissFabularian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2060082-missfabularian", "userReview": "Love, love, love this book!

The book held both of my daughters' interest for about 50% of the time.We then moved on to Chelsea Clinton's brainchild She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World and, though the illustrations were not the stunners of the previous book, they were lovely. However, I was once again left scratching my head over the 13 women who were chosen, (why, why must so many of them be so obscure?), and my 7-year-old had no interest in any of the stories, and my 9-year-old was interested for about 20% of the read.This week we moved on to Little Leaders: Bold Women in Black History written and illustrated by Vashti Harrison, and, even though the actual women chosen for this collection made a lot of sense, or more sense than the previous two collections, the \u201cblurbs\u201d felt like they were provided by Wikipedia, and the artwork seemed unoriginal, monotonous, and computer generated in appearance. The author writes that she designed them [the leaders] to be interchangeable \"because I want you, the reader, to see yourself in any one of them, and to feel their strength and possibility in you,\u201d and that's an interesting concept, but both of my daughters yawned openly on the book and all but fell asleep on its pages.Here's my biggest beef with all three of the books: WHO is the target audience? Are we trying to get Mom to buy copies to share with her daughters? If so, then tailor the women's blurbs to inspire the interest of children. Are we hoping that Mom will buy into the premise of buying them for her daughters, but then secretly enjoy them as part of her own library? If so, then spice up these dull stories!I have had the rare pleasure of spending part of an evening with Maya Angelou, and I can tell you, it was like having a conversation with a mountain that had just sprouted eyes. My bones vibrated just from sitting across from her. This book reduces her to a page that might as well have said blah, blah, blah.I have also had the pleasure of studying Zora Neale Hurston, who grew up not far from my university in Florida, and I found her to be one of the most fascinating humans who ever lived. The woman was an absolute enigma! And, again, the text reads blah, blah, blah.I have reluctantly given all three of these books 4 stars, because I believe in girl power and I like books that promote learning, but if this girl power trend in children's books continues, the authors and illustrators are going to need to work a little harder to earn my stars."}, {"userName": "paula", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1543634-paula", "userReview": "I have been a librarian serving kids for only 13 years (\u201conly\u201d because librarianship is a long-legged profession, and I have many colleagues my age who are celebrating 20 or 25 years already). So I can tell you that it was not that long ago that a little African American girl looking for someone who looked like her in the biography section had to settle for Harriet Tubman or Madam C.J. Walker. That is almost literally true.In recent years this situation has improved markedly. We have series biographies, picture book biographies, and standalone biographies of Mae Jemison, Shirley Chisholm, Rosa Parks, Nina Simone, Mahalia Jackson, Oprah Winfrey, Bessie Coleman, Edna Lewis, Josephine Baker, and more and more and more.And now this book, packed with short, snappy bios of admirable black women that are sure to inspire further research, debuts at #3 on the New York Times bestseller list.Pay tribute to the black women voters of Alabama by buying this book for the young person on your list this holiday.

I found it interesting that the project started with these illustrations being created for social media during Black History Month. It was nice that some of the women were ones that many students would have heard about, but others were more obscure. The summaries include just enough information to be read as a bedtime story or to a school class, and will pique readers' interest in finding out more information about these women of achievement. I enjoyed this a lot, and have only two minor quibbles-- the downcast eyes on the illustrations don't really say \"bold\" to me, and the bibliography is lacking. A list of sources consulted would have helped when readers wanted more information."}, {"userName": "Bree Hill", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26896300-bree-hill", "userReview": "This was such a joy. I listened to the audiobook but I\u2019ve seen the artwork online which is PHENOMENAL so I really want to get my hands on the physical book.I think what I liked the most about this book is how the author ties each woman\u2019s journey and story back to \u201cthrough adversity\u201d or whatever was standing her way, she still was able to accomplish whatever she did. And I think young women, grown women..women of all ages races backgrounds need to be reminded that.

The next thing, was the title and how it very much ties into my goal when it comes to teaching my future children about equality for all, as well as feminism (which I suppose can also be categorized under \u201cequality for all\u201d\u2026although I meant that one more for equality for all races? I\u2019m not sure if there is specific terminology that I should be using, but if you know, please share it with me in the comments!)I will want to teach my children about compassion and strength, and I believe that all other children should be taught about these things as well. This book, therefore, I believe should be found in every household, kindergarten, school library, and public library. While it not only teaches readers about standing up for what\u2019s right, and introducing them to a number of bold black women (out of which, I was only familiar with 4, before picking up this book), it is also well-written, and very nicely illustrated. I really like the style that was used to depict each woman, and how it stayed the same throughout. And I also found that I really enjoyed the colours, as well as how the text and images were laid out!This book looked beautiful sitting beneath my Christmas tree, and I think that all of the little humans in the world who celebrate Christmas could benefit from finding such a book beneath their tree, or in their stocking! It is my belief that this book is very important, and that we definitely need more books like this. Little humans, and grown humans alike, could stand to learn something from this book. I will be donating my copy to my local library, in the hopes that little humans can borrow and read it from there this holiday season, and for as long as the library chooses to keep it on their shelves thereafter."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1697920-stephanie", "userReview": "I can't think of a better book to read on Martin Luther King Jr. Day - an extremely accessible book full of stories of black women making history - in sometimes quiet but always impactful ways.Harrison's adorable and iconic illustrations for each black woman in history accompany a short, reader-friendly biography of each woman and her accomplishments. Young readers to old readers can enjoy these stories of amazing women and the illustrations that make them seem real and human.I especially love that each illustration starts as a \"template\" with the famous woman's defining features created on top. It purposely creates the sensation that the drawing could be anyone, even the reader. Harrison is both respectful of all reading levels and brave about adding harder truths about some of these women. She deftly describes their history and important life events (while sometimes painful) in highly empathetic and human ways. She also makes it clear that many of these trailblazers directly influenced other important woman later in the book. It's clear the legacy that seeing and acknowledging people of all backgrounds can have on the lives of people in any age.Absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone!"}, {"userName": "Quinn Rollins", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6677104-quinn-rollins", "userReview": "I've read many similar books, and I sometimes shy away from something so specific (targeting a narrow group of people instead of broader), but this is too outstanding to let pass by. Little Leaders: Bold Women in Black History is a collection of 40 one-page biographies of amazing African American women. Author/artist Vashti Harrison pulls from every walk of life--literature, politics, pop culture, athletics, science--to give children a chance to see a hero they can relate to. I was most exited to see Nichelle Nichols I think -- Lt. Uhura from the original Star Trek series. Having her in a book alongside Phyllis Wheatley and Angela Davis and Ruby Bridges -- I love it. The text tells readers about their personal lives, but focus on their accomplishments and why they deserve to be not just remembered, but celebrated.

The \"little leaders\" are adorable looking yet their clothing, their facial expressions, their postures, the objects they hold and interact with, and their environments were both realistic and symbolic. Sometimes before I read the one page biographical essay I'd ask \"What do you think this person did based on what you see?\" and my audience almost always guessed correctly we learned as we read. The text is lively to read and with the help of an adult, a third or fourth grader could read it herself. While entertaining, Harrison has not shied away from historical facts that address racism, sexism, economic hardish, and other important issues that even children should learn about. Yet at no time did we feel sad for long because each of the 40 women in this book was victorious in living her life fully and courageously, often in the service of others. At the end before a brief list of website, books, and recordings we can find to learn more, there is another brief list of 12 other \"little leaders\" we can learn more about.
