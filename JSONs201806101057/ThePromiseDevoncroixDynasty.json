For those who haven't seen my review of that book, it means that that I got drawn in immediately, then skimmed for a bit, then got a bit um, complacent, and then once again WHAM! the book began to fire on all eight cylinders and kept me captive right until the end.Then, of course, because my kindle happened to be charged up, as soon as I finished the last page I looked up the third book on Amazon. Renegade, it's called, and to the detriment of my book budget I clicked \"Buy\" and paid almost $7 bucks for it.Aaaannndd I also picked up the other two books that she's written, The Alchemist and The Awakening. Excellent storytelling - even if you don't particularly like werewolves."}, {"userName": "Galla", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4445010-galla", "userReview": "As Nicholas Devoncroix succeeds his father Alexander as pack leader, he faces a decision about the werewolves' \"human policy\" that could radically change the future of the pack. Interwoven with his story is the history of the older brother and adopted sister he never knew, Matise and Brianna Devoncroix, whose story is told through a volume of Matise's journals. It's an interesting tale, but I never developed much affection for the primary characters. There's a haughty remoteness to Matise's narrative that makes him seem distant, and while I felt sympathetic for Brianna at times--her inability to call upon the Passion and change into werewolf form is emotionally traumatizing for her--I still didn't especially like her. Hannah could have been a strong character, but after a few pages devoted to her back story, she really functions more as a framing device than a character in her own right. Nicholas himself seems remarkably unwise for the leader of a species that touts its members as so intellectually and socially superior to humans (honestly, Nicholas, how hard is it to keep your promise to your father and read Matise's book before you go making major political and social decisions?)I continue to wonder about some practical issues, too, like the fact that many werewolves are prominent members of human social and financial circles, followed by the press, tracked in the tabloids--and yet, the issue of the werewolves' longevity never seems to come up. If werewolves regularly live to the age of 150, humans would have started asking questions long ago. No matter what the werewolves think, we humans aren't that stupid or unobservant.I understand there's a third book planned for the series called The Covenant, but it has been long delayed. If it does end up being finished, I'll be curious to see where things go from the end of The Promise, but I'll be crossing my fingers in the hopes that I'll find the kind of compelling character arcs that made The Passion such an emotionally affecting read--and which were absent here."}, {"userName": "LMM", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1533889-lmm", "userReview": "A solid continuation of The Passion & I really recommend to anyone who has a thing for werewolves, loves the saga of The Witching Hour or The Vampire Chronicles. The prose really has that vibe without becoming redundant, purple or overly indulgent. I enjoyed both novels & felt they flowed really well from one to the other. I just refrain from giving this installment a full 5 stars for two main reasons; one I didn't find it as lushly written as the 1st novel. That book pretty much had me at \"hello\" so it took me a little longer to get as thoroughly involved, however once I did, I was transported & completely engrossed.The 2nd reason is that the narrative switches on & off from the present to the past. It completely makes sense why that is, it's just that it was a bit jarring for me because as I mentioned, I would become completely wrapped up in the story, so when I was pulled out of it for a brief interruption, I wasn't as interested in the present scenario or as connected to the two central characters in it. I was much more enraptured in hearing the history of Matise & Brianna Devoncroix.Whereas The Passion was essentially told as one long narrative which unfolded as proper storytelling & I felt it worked much better on the whole. Boyd broke out of it a bit here & I think it just slightly marred the wonderful spell she cast with The Passion.That said, I found the two novels a perfect break from the status quo formula outline which most paranormal authors adhere to & really, once you read a few series you can often write where they're going yourself. This was just really well done & a shift in perspective, IMO."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742058-diane", "userReview": "A wonderful follow up to the first book 'The Passion'.This book 'The Promise' is about the next generation of the Devoncroix family those born at the beginging of the 20th Century and how they live and come to terms with the legacy they have inherited from the parents. Donna Boyd again shows the dangers of her world when humans and werewolves mix too closely together but also how both are so appealing to one another. She also offers more of the werewolves own history and how they became masters of this world. Alas at times I really wanted to be able to reach into this world and slap Matise and Brianna for their arrogance towards humans, this also caused me at times to not want to continue reading, but I did as the story was so appealingly exotic and intensely sensuous. I just hope there will be more books in this series, cause altogether I want more!"}, {"userName": "\u2646 BookAddict  \u2712 La Crimson Femme", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3089655-bookaddict-la-crimson-femme", "userReview": "I read this book when it first came out.

I'm always excited to start on a new book. There is always the rush and excitement you have right at the beginning and if it is really good you keep throughout reading the entire book. But I don't think you should read a book only to be overwhelmed with all of the sadness and death only to find there is only a couple of parts where the characters are actually happy in it. Then you don't even have a happy ending. Needless to say this book completely depressed me and I will not be reading it again."}, {"userName": "Juliette", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1274820-juliette", "userReview": "I found this book a little more entertaining than the first book in the series. If you're thinking about reading this series, you may want to consider reading this one first. The main story seems to happen here while the first book is an off shoot.I am a werewolf fan, so my opinion is definitely weighed in favor of this book. Where the first book is a love story between a human and a werewolf, this book is about the love child of that affair. The pain she goes through trying to find her place in the world as not human, not werewolf and the werewolf who loved her."}, {"userName": "Allen Garvin", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/912305-allen-garvin", "userReview": "Reasonably interesting werewolf novel--in this, werewolves are the secret elites who are responsible for almost all civilization of humanity, the hidden overlords who direct the governments of the world. These werewolves are intelligent, proud (or arrogant), beautiful, bound by tradition, somewhat amoral. It's a well-told story, with sharply drawn characters, but it doesn't have the heart, or, so to speak, the Passion, of Boyd's previous book."}, {"userName": "D", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3046362-d", "userReview": "Fantastic sequel to The Passion, a story of the interactions of humans and werewolves. The Promise is the story of Brianna, the half human/half werewolf child of Tessa and Alexander's exiled brother (I forgot his name at the moment), and Matise, her adopted brother. Family lines get a little tricky, but I find that I cannot put these books down once I start. The complicated story told is always heartbreakingly beautiful. I think these are by far the best adult werewolf books I've read."}, {"userName": "Cassie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/200876-cassie", "userReview": "This is actually book 2 in a series; I didn't know that when I read it, and to be honest, I don't think it took away from the story not know what happened in The Passion. Definitely much deeper - more serious - than books I usually enjoy, but I did enjoy this one. I listened to the Book on CD and the reader was fantastic!

But it was the telling of them, in the end, that brought her to ruin.\"From the journals of Matise DevoncroixHannah Braselton North has abandoned civilization to spend her life in the Alaskan wilderness. And now she holds in her hands the supposed \"memoirs\" of one Matise Devoncroix. It is a story of strange desires and forbidden love--the tale of a magnificent hidden race and a tortured, doomed relationship. And it is somehow connected to the critically injured male wolf Hannah pulled from the same airplane wreckage in which she discovered the diary.But the deeper she delves into Devoncroix's story--and the stronger her recovering \"patient\" becomes--the more the sad, reclusive scientist realizes that what she is reading is no mere fiction. The world's true rulers have been revealed to her: fierce, strong, beautiful, and sensual creatures who have long dominated civilization in secret. The burned and bloody wolf she has taken into her small cabin is one of them: a living relation of the tragic Matise, Nicholas Devoncroix. And as his broken body mends, his awesome powers of attraction strengthen as well--as do his memories and his rage...and his lust for vengeance.", "title": "The Promise\n      \n          (Devoncroix Dynasty #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77838.The_Promise", "average": 3.93, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388560246l/77838.jpg", "reviews": 29, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/44103.Donna_Boyd", "name": "Donna Boyd"}], "type": ["Shapeshifters", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77838.The_Promise", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148026.The_Passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/259127.The_Alchemist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1163116.The_Awakening", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12992088-renegade", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/178445.NCLEX_RN_Review_Manual_with_STUDYware_CD_ROM", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
