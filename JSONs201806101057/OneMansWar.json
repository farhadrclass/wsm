But it really IS one man's war: the narrator is so solipsistic that no one else seems real, save as a collection of characturers (red neck, Brooklyn accent, pretty nurse). And he's no deep thinker: one man takes it one day at a time. Which, to be fair, is how most private soldier survived."}, {"userName": "Tom Bromley", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39045628-tom-bromley", "userReview": "I received a free copy of this book from Goodreads. It is a novel detailing one man's account of his war experience during WW II. It is a gripping and honest book about the hell these men experienced while fighting and the anguish of war. I found the book fascinating and informative."}, {"userName": "Sue ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/690922-sue", "userReview": "War is Hell and this book brings World War II to the reader with all of the grit and fear that goes with such a horrific experience. The main character Bob Kafak, is on the front lines. He can't see the big picture, he has to endure the day to day shelling and rain and mud and cold and at times boredom. He is often close to the German lines and is involved in a lot of fighting from the beaches of Anzio to the south of France. He chooses not to be promoted to a higher rank because he sees so many of the officers get killed. So while the higher ups are controlling the moves of the armies, the reader is getting a day by day look at what actually goes on with an individual soldier whose goal is to stay alive despite all that is going on.This is not my normal genre of book but I definitely enjoyed the novel. I thought that the main character was very well created and very real. He was definitely a good representation of a soldier of the time. I was also very interested in the parts of the story that took place in France. My father was in WWII and was in southern France and like the author's father, never talked about the war until very late in his life.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a gritty real story about WWII from the soldiers' point of view. But it can also be enjoyed by a reader who wants to read a real coming of age story about a young man who gets drafted and learns what's important in life during his time at war. (Thanks to the author for providing a copy of this book for a fair and honest review.)"}, {"userName": "Roger Neilson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5910965-roger-neilson", "userReview": "You could, I imagine, transpose this to any period and any army. It gives a vivid example of how chaotic and brutal war can be in all its forms - and how far removed from most human experience it is. Helpful that the end has a short summary of what 'really' was happening."}, {"userName": "Eva", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25685960-eva", "userReview": "Bob Kafak\u2019s time as a frontline soldier is realistically portrayed in P.

It does not glorify war as we see in Hollywood films; this is just an account by an ordinary soldier during WWII.

It makes visceral the fear, the filth, and the cold that were his constant companions. Kafak is a reluctant hero who intentionally pisses off the brass to avoid promotion because he has seen too many of his commanding officers get blown to pieces and he doesn\u2019t want to be next. He fights from the beaches of Anzio in Italy and battles up through the South of France toward Germany, facing one terrible heart-pounding encounter after another. Seen through Kafak\u2019s thick-lensed army-issued glasses, the wider implications of the war remain blurry while he focuses on the simple, urgent needs of survival: keep your head down, keep your feet dry, gain the next six feet of ground, and concentrate on what tomorrow will bring.", "title": "One Man's War", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27177966-one-man-s-war", "average": 4.14, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1449532325l/27177966.jpg", "reviews": 9, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14959232.P_M_Kippert", "name": "P.M.
