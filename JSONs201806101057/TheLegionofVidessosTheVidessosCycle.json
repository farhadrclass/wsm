I usually read to relax before bedtime and I was late to bed many nights while enjoying this story."}, {"userName": "Leelan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/513481-leelan", "userReview": "Way too long since I read this series.

A lot of the basic politics and challenges that the main protagonist (Marcus Scaurus, a Roman commander caught with his legion in another world) faces are very similar in flavor to the previous book. In some sense, Marcus spends this book spinning his wheels in one way or another, either chasing down allies who turned into bad guys (by rebelling againt the Emperor of Videssos, this world's equivalent of Rome), or sitting in an office job (as penance for letting prisoners escape) - the reasons are different, but he spent a lot of the previous book doing the same things. Still, the story does go someplace, as the wife of his child betrays him (helping those prisoners escape) and this alters his relationship with the Emperor and the Emperor's sister, who Marcus has been greatly attracted to even when paired with the woman who eventually betrayed him.Other main characters from the Roman contingent get to go do very different things - a group travels to distant lands looking for allies, and ends up getting split, and the characters face different sorts of adversity. In many ways, these events provides a lot more interesting tale than what's going on for Marcus. Overall, this felt a lot like an extended setup for what is supposed to be more interesting events in the next and final book in the series.... likely mostly necessary, and maybe a lot of the plodding will turn out to be relevant, but the book sort of dragged in places, especially when watching Marcus get dragged through the mud (at times quite literally...)"}, {"userName": "Ippino", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19884369-ippino", "userReview": "Come allungare il \"brodo\"... alla cattedra, il Sig. Turtledove.Ho fatto molta fatica a terminare di leggere questo terzo volume del Ciclo di Videssos, in parte per la noiosit\u00e0 delle vicende narrate, ed in parte perch\u00e8 mancano i bei dialoghi ed i fitti rapporti interpersonali, finora i pilastri di questa saga.Cinquecento pagine di una scialba guerriglia della legione contro i Namdaleni, unita al prolisso vagabondare senza meta di Viridovix e Gorgidas, per finire con Marcus che si fa beffare da completo inetto.Non \u00e8 completamente da dimenticare, per\u00f2 sarebbe ora che \"i buoni\" cominciassero a prendere a bastonate gli Yezda, invece che farlo tra di loro.L'unico obiettivo raggiunto \u00e8 stato quello di farmi odiare definitivamente il popolo dei Namdaleni, che passano dagli uomini fieri e pieni di dignit\u00e0 descritti nel primo volume, ad un branco di zingari privi di qualsiasi codice morale, pronti a cambiare bandiera con la rapidit\u00e0 di un battito d'ali."}, {"userName": "Michael Bracken", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8538497-michael-bracken", "userReview": "Loved this series and the idea of a lost Roman unit transported through dimensions. There was a lot of politics to go through but it was an excellent story with plenty of detail for the imagination. I hope that future books build off this series, possibly on the children of the emperor and the Romans. I was a little sad the writer did not sort out what happened to certain family members at the end but again I hope that's a possible tie in for another series to build off of this one to progress the videssos timeline."}, {"userName": "Nathan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7319371-nathan", "userReview": "The band of Earthlings transported to Videssos has split up. Some are heading north to persuade the Mongols. Sorry. The Arshaum, to join the side of the Empire. The others are off west to squash more rebellion. Time passes.And the book passes, too. A bit of a filler, this one. Clearly being used to lay the groundwork for the fourth and final volume. Not without its moments, but it is effectively part one of a two parter. See you after book four.Rated MA for frequent violence, supernatural themes, sex scenes and adult content and a scene of horror. 3/5"}, {"userName": "Timothy Boyd", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22819383-timothy-boyd", "userReview": "If you like the \"displaced person in another world\" stories then this is the series for you. Now we get an entire legion of roman soldiers, oh and one crazed Celt, on another world. Throw in that magic works there and you have a fantastic story and some awesome characters. Turtledove is one of my top 5 favorite writers. My highest recommendation."}, {"userName": "Francesco Grandis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35071876-francesco-grandis", "userReview": "Dal primo libro della serie \u00e8 una lenta discesa.

He had been largely responsible for ousting the Pretender and putting Thorish Gavras on the throne. That, of course, made him a hero.Rome or Videssos, however, Fortune was a fickle goddess.Now he and the legion were returning in triumph to Videssos the city after defeating a well-entrenched army of rebel mercenaries. But Marcus, betrayed by the one closest to him, was returning to be seized, dragged before the Emperor, and questioned under truth-drug like a traitor.Of the court, only Alypia Gavra stuck by him -- but consorting with the Emperor's niece was dangerous. It could lead to exile -- or death!Yet Alypia was attractive. And Marcus was lonely . . .", "title": "The Legion of Videssos\n      \n          (The Videssos Cycle #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101549.The_Legion_of_Videssos", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1403177050l/101549.jpg", "reviews": 15, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/29479.Harry_Turtledove", "name": "Harry Turtledove"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Historical", "Fiction", "Science Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101549.The_Legion_of_Videssos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10280590-la-legione-di-videssos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6159931-the-legion-of-videssos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101599.The_Guns_of_the_South", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101527.In_the_Balance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/842939.How_Few_Remain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101570.Tilting_the_Balance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101528.Striking_the_Balance"]}
