I've been dying to read more books with him in them for a while now, but with all the fae craziness it has been a long time since he and the other vampires have featured in a book.*squeals*STEFAN!I just love the way Briggs does vampires.For the most part, they're pretty awful creatures with very few redeemable qualities. And the few that aren't evil seem to be fighting against their nature to stay that way. Other than Stefan, whom she's still pretty wary of, Mercy despises and distrusts the entire species. But due to an interesting turn of events towards the end, you can see her start to rethink her long-held beliefs.Somewhat, anyway.Regardless, I'm 100% sure she's not going to be sporting a Team Edward t-shirt anytime soon. Because, hello? Adam...!So the gist of the story is that Mercy takes a European vacation (against her will), stirs up some scary ghosts for an alpha wolf, reanimates a legendary golem, ends up in an undead crack house, and uncovers the vampire version of a mad scientist!Ish.So, I know what you're thinking. What was Adam and the rest of the gang up to while Mercy was doing all this?!Well, they were having a sleepover with the scariest vampire in Europe, beating the hell out of backstabbers with expensive china plates, and trying to rescue a Coyote - all while trying to avoid an all-out war for dominance within the supernatural community.It was FANTASTIC!Ooh! Ooh! And there is a twist at the end that had me flipping back through the entire book to see how the hell I could have missed it!My biggest complaint? It was too damn short!Highly recommended for fans of urban fantasy."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Oh Mercy!

New Mercy Thompson book, on sale as of March 2017! Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature: It\u2019s pirating night in the werewolf house, and Mercy, a coyote skinwalker married to Adam, the handsome Alpha of the Columbia Basin werewolf pack, quickly gets killed out of the werewolf pack\u2019s computer-based pirate LARP game. She heads to the kitchen to make a double-quadruple batch of chocolate chip cookies for the pack (her habit of baking treats after being exiting the game having more than a little to do with why someone always kills her off early in these games). Only, there are no eggs in the house, even though she\u2019d had four dozen in the fridge two days ago. Werewolves are a hungry bunch. So Mercy makes a quick run to the local convenience store. Her last memory is getting hit by the airbags in her SUV.When Mercy wakes up, she\u2019s imprisoned and alone in a strange, metallic-sheeted room, covered with her own blood but otherwise uninjured, if weak and nauseous. More alarmingly, her psychic \u201cmate bond\u201d with Adam, through which she can always sense his presence, is completely missing.Silence had fallen between us, not the electric, expectant kind. This silence was the emptiness that falls in the dead of night in the middle of a Montana winter when the world is encased in snow and icy cold, a silence that engulfed my soul and left me alone.Two vampires, strangers to Mercy who look like Italian gangsters, enter the room and greet her. One radiates power and the other \u2026 nothing at all. But she thinks she knows which one is in charge, and it\u2019s extremely bad news. He had her kidnapped because he was told, by someone being deceptive, that she was the most dangerous person in the Tri-Cities. Now he\u2019s beginning to realize that she isn\u2019t as valuable a hostage as he had hoped. Clearly escape is a good plan, the sooner the better, except that Mercy suspects that the vampire in charge wants her to try to escape, so his crazed werewolf guard can \u2015 oops! \u2015 kill her.Meanwhile, Adam is gathering an impressive rescue team. He, Marsilia and Stefan (two of the most powerful vampires in their alliance), the witch Elizaveta, and a few other friends are trying to figure out where Mercy is and how they can get her back \u2026 without causing a deadly interspecies war between vampires and werewolves. In a very real sense, Mercy is more dangerous than she or her captors think.A major change of scenery and particularly intricate plotting are distinguishing points in Silence Fallen (2017), the tenth book in Patricia Briggs\u2019 MERCY THOMPSON urban fantasy series. The different setting is a breath of fresh air, and Briggs takes advantage of the rich culture, including a guest role by the famous Golem of Prague. Briggs weaves the Golem into the twisty plot of Silence Fallen, along with Iacopo (Jacob) Bonarata, the vampire known as the Master of Milan. He\u2019s been mentioned in several prior books in this series, and it\u2019s great fun (if you can call meeting a Renaissance prince vampire fun) to finally meet him and see both his flaws and his mastermind level of manipulation and plotting. Briggs does her own complex plotting in Silence Fallen, with various layers that are gradually revealed and then tie together in a very satisfactory way in the end, with a few surprises along the way.Mercy\u2019s narration and Adam\u2019s point of view alternate in Silence Fallen, as they try to find their way back to each other and deal with separate but interrelated dangers. The timeline isn\u2019t entirely linear as it jumps between Mercy\u2019s and Adam\u2019s points of view, sometimes backtracking a day or more. It\u2019s a bit disorienting, and I\u2019m not entirely sure it really helped me that Briggs (in a foreword note) and Mercy both mention the time shifts, since it pulled me out of the story. But that\u2019s a minor issue, and one of my few dissatisfactions with this story.Silence Fallen is a strong addition to a great urban fantasy series, but the books do need to read in order. For fans of the genre, it\u2019s well worth your time.Initial reaction: I can't believe I downloaded this from NetGalley, decided to read just the first chapter (because there are too many other books I'm supposed to be reading and reviewing) ... and finished it (sometime after midnight) the same night.

Yes, I said book TEN. I\u2019ve been reading these books for well over a decade and I still get that crazy excited feeling when I know a new Mercy and Adam book is coming out! If there is one thing about Mercy you should know, it\u2019s that trouble always seems to find her. She can\u2019t help it. Thankfully, she\u2019s tough, resourceful, and has an amazing mate. This book starts out with Mercy being kidnapped by one of the most powerful vampires and taken to Europe. Mercy being Mercy finds a way out of it, but then she gets into another pickle\u2026 meanwhile, Adam and an interesting crew comes to her rescue. \u2028Adam, Marsilla, Stephan, Elizabetta and a few others are having their own adventure of sorts while Mercy is doing her own thing. I loved how we got to be in Adam\u2019s head so much in this story. It went back and forth between him and Mercy throughout the book. This book, like all the others left me wondering how Mercy was going to come out completely unscathed. There was a lot that could go wrong, and many moments left me holding my breath and biting off my fingernails. This book had a few twists and turns that managed to surprise me. It was full of action, suspense, and was well written and captivating. I listened to the audiobook, and like always, the narrator did a fantastic job. She is Mercy to me. This series is one of my favorites, and this book did not disappoint! I just hope the next one comes out sooner rather than later, I know sometimes the wait is 2-3 years.

She escapes her captors and ends up in the gothic city of Prague, where she has no clue if the people and supernatural creatures she comes across are friend or foe. As time goes by Mercy discovers there is more than one creature that has her in their sits, it\u2019s just a matter of whether or not she can find a safe place to go.  \u201cI looked like a victim. I was done, really done with being a victim.\u201d  I love this series, it never ever fails to deliver a thrilling story and a smile to my face. Patricia Briggs writes hands down one of the best urban fantasy series ever. I love getting lost in the Tricities realm, the characters feel like friends and family as you read along. This is book ten and the series is still going strong, connecting the previous happenings of the books before while creating a new and unique story.I was majorly geeking out when reading this book. Why? I studied abroad for a year in the city of Prague, and the majority of this book was based there! And it was all accurate! I felt as if I was walking the streets of that city again and it made me miss it. Briggs very obviously either knows the city well herself, or did some awesome research. Plus the addition of the Prague Golem to the plot? Genius! And amazingly well done.Anyways, I gave it 4.5 instead of 5 because honestly, Adams bits were kinda boring to me with all the political stuff. But otherwise I LOVED this book. And that twist at the end? I never saw it coming, even though thinking back there were some clues. I just missed them.This is a series you need to be reading, and if you already are, read this book immediately!  \u201cWhere is the glory if there is no one left to tell the story?\u201d   ARC provided by publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review Follow me on \u2665 Facebook \u2665 Blog \u2665 Instagram \u2665 Twitter \u2665"}, {"userName": "Niki Hawkes - The Obsessive Bookseller", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13396599-niki-hawkes---the-obsessive-bookseller", "userReview": "[4.5 stars] Anything written by Patricia Briggs these days is pure gold. I always try to savor them (the year-long wait between books is brutal!), but always seem to find myself devouring pages like there\u2019s no tomorrow! The Mercy Thompson series is the sort of guaranteed good read that leaves me no doubt I\u2019m going to love every moment. Silence Fallen was another awesome book in a long line of killer novels.Without giving anything important away, I think it\u2019s safe to reveal that Silence Fallen takes place primarily in another country. It was a much-appreciated change of scenery. Briggs provided an immersive experience rich in history and vibrant and description. It was a lot of fun getting to explore new environments (notice I haven\u2019t mentioned where? The discovery is part of the fun! You\u2019ll have to read it to find out). My only hold up is that I thought historical facts could\u2019ve been integrated a little bit smoother. Briggs utilized the character\u2019s personal knowledge of the place a little too often to be believable. Seriously, are you really going to be able to recall tiny details about a place you learned about in passing years ago in college? I didn\u2019t totally buy it, but that\u2019s probably because I can\u2019t remember what I did yesterday. :) Regardless of delivery, the description was incredibly well researched and made me feel like I was there. It was a new adventure filled with fun discoveries and interesting villains. Silence Fallen also offered multiple POVs, something I LOVED because I just can\u2019t get enough of Adam Hauptman. His perspective adds so much richness to the story and I\u2019m hoping it won\u2019t be the last time he gets a moment in the spotlight.Overall, Silence Fallen was packed with an awesome mix of supernatural, humor, romance, and action, topping itself off with one wallop of a surprise at the end that will knock you out of your armchair. If you haven\u2019t given this series a try, you\u2019re totally missing out!I\u2019d like to thank Berkley Publishing Group, Patricia Briggs, and NetGalley for the chance to read and review an early copy of Silence Fallen.Via The Obsessive Bookseller at www.nikihawkes.com"}, {"userName": "Yodamom", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905141-yodamom", "userReview": "Non spoiler, all feels reviewI need to make some chocolate chip cookies.Separated but never separate.

Her allies are still in place, but all their power and might has been nullified by the Atlantic Ocean. Thompson is forced to do what she does best. Survive. I loved this book because even though I always look forward to reconnecting with the Tri-Cities cast, it was Patricia Briggs' strong heroine that first drew me to this series, and continues to call to me with each new installment. There were still a lot of chapters told from Hauptman's point of view, and a couple from a few other characters' as well. So, even though this novel was mostly about our favourite VW mechanic, there was a hearty dose of Adam, Honey, Stefan, Elizaveta, and Marsilia in addition to newcomers from the European seethes and the Vltava pack not to mention a guest appearance from Matt Smith\u2014not the Doctor, but you should pay special attention to him all the same!I liked how interconnected all the different plot threads were. Initially, the players seemed to be working independently of each other however, as the author built towards the finish line that\u2019s when Briggs\u2019 mad skills at her craft manifested. The pacing felt off in the early chapters, so it\u2019s important to judge this title for all its parts because every word has meaning, and if you find yourself as blindsided by the curveball as I was, I suspect that that ending will incite many a re-read.This volume had one last thing going for it, and that was the way it expounded upon Mercy\u2019s Coyote lineage, and her aptitude with the dead. Ghosts have been constant companions of the heroine but, she\u2019s mostly ignored them until now. I also loved how forces like Charles and Wulfe attested to the fact that Thompson is the most dangerous person in the Tri-Cities. Fans already know this however, it took Lenka\u2019s run-in with a bus, and eluding the Lord of the Night to sway Iacopo.SILENCE FALLEN was motherhumping rad!"}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11855472-steven", "userReview": "Patricia Briggs has proven time and again that she can write UF in a very special way.

It's chock full of supernatural politics, danger and adventure, new characters, development of older characters, and FUN.I think my biggest gripe is the \"twist.\" I actually had considered the possibility, but then the internal thoughts of multiple characters made that impossible, and some things were so out of character that I discounted it soon after, only to find out I had been right in my off the wall theory. Makes me wonder a few things and almost cost the review a half star for the silliness of the whole thing. But in the end, I decided it wasn't a big enough deal to deduct anything, and the book had been a blast.Thanks to Briggs for writing another fantastic entry.

What do they want and how will she get away? As usual Mercy survives by her wits, thinking things through quickly and using hard won experience to her advantage. Mercy is away from Adam and her Pack for most of the book, but before you go panicking, let me reassure you Adam is still very much a part of the story and we get his POV more than we have in any other books in the past. I loved it! Got to \u201csee\u201d just how much Mercy means to Adam, and how living with his wolf is more of a struggle than I knew. It was interesting to get a bit of Marsilia, Stefan and Wulfe\u2019s history, why they came to America. It was interesting to see Marsilia in a little different light, and not as awful as she usually is. Patricia Briggs has crafted one of my all-time favorite female characters in Mercy. Her intelligence shines with every problem she encounters. Mercy ponders things through like body language, repercussions of action, and what she says, weighing possible outcomes, doing this pretty quickly! Silence Fallen is another amazing installment in the Mercy Thompson series! I was almost glad I was sick this weekend because it gave me an excuse to sit home and read this straight through. It took me longer to finish than an average book, because I didn\u2019t want to miss anything! There were a few twists, and one surprise I did not see coming.

Buddy read with Sarah and Erica.I admit, I was a little worried when I saw that Mercy's bond to Adam, and the Pack, was going to be\u00a0broken. Again. The blurb makes it sound much more familiar than the reality of the circumstances are. I was thankful for that, because I might have been a bit frustrated had I been compelled to deal with the broken bond again. Honestly, for me, Mercy and Adam are so tightly wound that I\u00a0\nknow\n there is nothing that can break them apart. And that's just the way I like it.Fair warning: Mercy and Adam spend the majority of this book apart and out of contact. It's not as bad as you might fear though, because we get ALTERNATING POVs. That's right. You read correctly. Nearly every chapter switches back and forth between Adam and Mercy. It's an interesting storytelling tactic, not least of which because the timeline isn't linear. Patricia Briggs jumps around a bit in the timeline, and as the Author's Note at the start says - pay attention to Mercy's notes at the beginning of each chapter. The flow of the story worked very well for me, but if you don't pay attention it might get a bit confusing.\nThis wasn't the first time chocolate got me into trouble.\nI've read this book twice now, the first time I could hardly process my feelings, so I had to re-read the entire series and then start again with fresh eyes. I'm not sure I'm beyond the fangirling still, to be honest. I loved this book. I know that some people think that dragging out the relationship drama is the way to keep things tense and the story fresh, but I get so tired of that. Part of what I enjoy so much in this series is that the relationship is\u00a0\nnever\n the source of the drama. There are always outside factors that are driving the plot. It makes things so much more interesting.\nI'm a mechanic, I fix things that are broken. I turn into a thirty-five-pound coyote. I have powerful friends. But when it comes right down to it, my real superpower is chaos.\nMercy continues to be one of the most subtle kick-ass characters that I read. She truly believes that she's weaker than most everyone around her, and that is kind of true. I mean, she isn't as strong or invulnerable as the vampires or werewolves. She doesn't have as obvious of magic as the fae. But what she does have is an indomitable will. She survives. No matter what.Better than that, though, is the fact that she does it without hiding or cowering from what she believes to be right. As Honey said about her previously, once Mercy has your back, she has your back. She will never give up, and she will do everything in her power to help you out. Despite the consequences to herself. Maybe that's not as kick-ass as some other characters (whom I love as much), but you can't deny that Mercy gets things done.\n\"I only get weirder the longer you know me,\" I told him, quoting one of the T-shirts I'd gotten for my last birthday.\nA large part of what makes this series so great is the characters. They're incredibly complex. The werewolves aren't just strong and turn into wolves. They are more prone to violence, and have to work hard to keep control of their tendencies in that direction. The vampires aren't just sexual blood-drinkers, they're dead and they kill people to survive. It's hard to justify it, even within the world, even knowing some of them are much better than others. The fae aren't simply powerful fairies. They're the stuff of nightmares that our fairy-tales tried to warn us about.And even still, with such generalizations, there are individual differences. Some characters, in all factions, are supremely intelligent and able to move the world like it's their own personal chessboard. Some are manipulative as hell. Some care, but pretend they don't. The machinations that each character is sometimes hiding makes them all fascinating. There are layers and layers to these characters, and often I don't see them all until the end.All these different characters, jockeying for position and power, playing a game that is larger than may even be understandable, make the world a fraught place - full of danger and intrigues around every corner.\n[He] thought of himself as a peaceful man. But he couldn't deny that there was beauty in violence, a battle between two well-trained warriors.\nWe've spent the entirety of our time with Mercy (and Anna and Charles) in the United States, which makes sense. But I found it really cool to visit Europe here. Especially Prague, which is a city that tugs at my heart. Though I've never been, I can say that the book set the feel for Prague, and Europe in general, making me feel and imagine that I could be there with Mercy. I appreciate the atmosphere that it built.I was on the edge of my seat both times reading this book. The plot is full of tension. Even when things were relatively calm, Adam and Mercy were still separated; outside forces were continuing to subtly guide events; and I was always wondering when the other shoe was going to drop.\nWater is wet and vampires are treacherous.\nI am struggling with how much to say about anything that happens here. There are a couple of things that I don't even want to allude to. Forgive me for being a bit light on details about the specifics of the plot. I will say that\u00a0Silence Fallen is an excellent addition to the Mercy Thompson world, and I can't wait to see what happens next.Review also available at The Book Eaters"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3344685-sarah", "userReview": "1st Read - November 20162nd Read - February 20173rd Read - March 2018Full ReviewWhen Mercy is abducted and whisked abroad by an enemy she finds herself completely alone in a strange country with none of her usual allies on hand to turn to. We've all seen Mercy get herself out of difficult situations in the past but finding her way home from Europe with no money, no passport and no assistance might just be one mess she can't handle. Of course Adam immediately mounts a rescue mission but he's up against powerful enemies and Mercy is a long way away so it's vital that she holds on long enough for him to reach her.I was lucky enough to get an advanced copy of Silence Fallen and I devoured it as soon as it arrived on my kindle. I loved it so much that I had to go away and reread the entire series (both Mercy's books and the Alpha & Omega ones!) so I could read it again at the correct point in the timeline. This is one of the few series that really does get better and better with every book and I love it more each time I reread it. I'll admit I was a bit disappointed when I found out that Mercy and Adam would be separated for much of the story but when I realised that we'd be getting a very large chunk of the book in Adam's POV it more than made up for my worries.Mercy may be the star of this series but her relationship with Adam is integral and I loved the chance to spend more time in his head to see exactly how he was dealing with things. They both have very important roles to play in this book, Mercy manages to escape but has to try and stay out of their enemy's clutches while Adam is forced to take a more passive role as a negotiator to try and make sure their enemy knows he's messed with the wrong pack of werewolves. I thoroughly enjoyed both of their storylines and I loved the way Patricia Briggs played around with the timeline so cleverly. The story unfolds in a nonlinear fashion so it jumps around a little and you need to pay attention but it really helped to add extra tension.I've never considered Mercy to be a helpless character and she proves her resilience again here, she may not be as strong as the vampires and werewolves physically but she's smart and cunning and she knows how to use that to her advantage. People constantly underestimate her and that's always their undoing but I love watching her worm her way out of impossible situations. Adam is out of his mind with worry when Mercy is taken, especially because he knows how badly she was injured and he isn't there to protect her or make sure she's safe. He will call in any favour he has to to get to her but he trusts her to keep herself safe in the meantime. I love that Adam is the one person who knows exactly what Mercy is capable of, that never stops him worrying about her or wanting to protect her but he also respects her need to be independent and stand on her own two feet.I don't want to give anything else away about the plot but I loved the change of setting and really enjoyed getting to meet a whole bunch of new characters both friends and foe. I've found the pack politics has been getting a little annoying in the more recent books (although thankfully that seems to have been solved in Fire Touched) so it was nice to take a step away from home and avoid some of the pack members who have been causing trouble lately. Of course Adam isn't alone when he mounts is rescue mission so you'll see a few familiar faces which is always nice. I was actually surprised about how much I ended up liking a character I've loved to hate in previous books. The story had me totally hooked from beginning to end and I didn't want to put it down even the second time I read it. If there is one thing I would change it would be to have a longer section at the end after Mercy and Adam been reunited - not because the story needed it but because I'm greedy and I adore spending time with them as a couple! This is one of my favourite urban fantasy series, it's a comfort read that I revisit at least once a year and again I've been left itching to get my hands on the next instalment.Source: Received from publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review___________________________First read mini review - November 2016It's far too early to write a full review of this book (it's not published until March next year) but this is a fabulous instalment to the series and I can't wait to reread it closer to the release date. It's actually inspired me to do a complete series reread, I just love Mercy & Adam but this whole world is fantastic and there are so many amazing side characters. This and the Kate Daniels series are my two favourites and the only ones I regularly reread all the way through.A few things you can look forward to:- Taking a trip to Europe when Mercy is kidnapped- Getting to meet a new European wolf pack- Mercy kicking butt- Adam practising diplomacy- Goblins- A meddling Coyote_______________I have it, I have it, I HAVE IT!!! Thank you Ace and Netgalley, on a particularly shitty day getting approved for this was a tiny (but much appreciated!) ray of sunshine :o) Sorry to all the other books I'm supposed to be reading but I'm starting this tomorrow. I'd start it now but some shitty election results kept me up most of the night and I can hardly keep my eyes open now."}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "[Do you think Adam knew who Matt Smith was?

My initial thoughts when reading the synopsis months ago was eek, are we finally getting more Stefan?While I'm team Adam all the way for Mercy romantic wise, I think it's a shame the author hasn't explored more of the closeness of Stefan and Mercy, especially since he's a favorite, fascinating character for me. There's a lot more that could be done there, and instead we get books where he's completely missing, or the most where he gets a few lines and then vanishes again for the rest of the story. Since this involved vampires, I thought it was an inevitable conclusion we'd get more Stefan. I was right....and wrong.\tThe winning feature of this sequel is the storyline. A lot happens in random stages but not where they are solving one big mystery or villain like usual. It's actually so layered it's better than most. The story doesn't stay with Mercy being kidnapped, but breaks free into all sorts of other things - the local Alpha, another vampire group that has hidden dangers that tangle with morality and secrets, weird Golam things. Mercy learns a lot more about herself and her ghost power (finally, that's been overused to see and acknowledge them before). There's some resolution and stuff with Bran that's awesome. While Mercy is separated from Adam during pretty much the entire book, their bond is head on strong and you don't feel like they are that absent from each other. Briggs takes turns in both of their heads, which isn't something she started doing until recently.\tCharacter-wise we get lots of Adam, who was top notch. His line when sees Mercy at the end for the first time melted my heart. He's tough and plays politics well with the vampires. Definitely top form for the alpha. We get some new people, as well as truly intriguing and tricky villains. We have to leave behind the familiar though, which means saying goodbye to almost all the pack, Jesse and Aiden. We also don't get to see familiar fae pop up, but we do get some time - finally - with the vampire seethe again. I always found Marsilia annoying but in this book she's actually more than tolerable. She's not smug but she's reasonable. Dare I say likeable to a degree? The vampire politics got on my nerves before in previous books, but this time they work splendidly. Stefan is around but mainly in the background, although he is definitely not a vanishing character. Sadly he only has a brief (less than one page) with Mercy again since I swear the author is determined to keep them apart because she's not sure what to do with them or something. The half page scene was awesome though.\t\t\t\t\tEven if we shrug off the familiarity we know and love from the series, Briggs shows she is still strongly married to the series with fresh twists, inventive characters who still seem fresh and original, and this series hasn't grown tired at all. In fact more is developing for Mercy herself, and I'm already jonesing for the next book.Oh, and there is an ending twist/surprise that brings a smile and laugh. Trust me, it's great.\tReviewed after receiving an ARC off Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Carole (Carole's Random Life in Books)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5892196-carole-carole-s-random-life-in-books", "userReview": "This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life in Books.This book! Oh how I loved this book. This is such an amazing series that seems to be getting better and better with each book. I started reading this book the moment I had it downloaded on my ereader and finished it less than 24 hours later. I just couldn't put it down. I had to know that things would work out for Mercy, Adam, and the whole gang. This is the kind of book that I just love to read.This is the tenth book in the Mercy Thompson series which I do recommend reading in order. The relationships between the characters have grown and developed over the course of the series and readers really need that knowledge to get the most out of this book. The series is absolutely amazing so you really don't want to miss any of it anyway.This story is a little different than what I have come to expect from this series. Different in a good way though. Much of this book occurs away from home and I have to admit that this worried me. Have no fear. The awesomeness of this series is still there it just happens in a different location. The key characters from the series all do play a part in this book even though it occurs far from home. I actually think that the change in setting was a plus in this book since it added a new and unknown element. Another difference that I was thrilled to see in this book is that part of the story is told from Adam's point of view. I was incredibly excited to get to read some of this story from Adam's perspective. We have had the opportunity to see so much of Adam over the course of the series and I found it really nice to finally get to spend some time in his head. This story really only would work well with another point of view and I am really glad that it came from Adam.This book starts off with a bang. Actually, it starts off with cookies and then quickly gets exciting when Mercy is kidnapped and taken halfway around the world to Prague. Mercy is thought to be very powerful by her kidnappers and she must figure out how to outsmart them in order to save herself. The kidnappers have a head start but Adam isn't too far behind and he is willing to do what it takes to save his mate. There are some pretty awesome vampires, werewolves, and ghosts among other things. There were a few surprises along the way and at least one twist that totally floored me.I would highly recommend this book to others. This is a book that I will definitely be reading again. Probably quite a few times. This is a truly great series that is dear to my heart. I can't wait to read more books about Mercy, Adam, and the gang as soon as I can get my hands on them.I received an advance reader edition of this book from Berkley Publishing Group via NetGalley.Initial ThoughtsThis was sooo good! A little different than other books in this series but a very fun ride. I loved that we get a lot of the story from Adam's perspective in addition to Mercy. This one was hard to put down.So excited to get my hands on an ARC of this book! Thank you NetGalley!"}, {"userName": "Marta Cox", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14378267-marta-cox", "userReview": "Ok I admit it I got this arc and gave in! I know it's not actually released until March 2017 but my impatience knew no bounds. So it's really not fair of me to go into too much depth but I will just get a few thoughts down whilst it's fresh in my mind.This series has grown in strength and whereas initially we saw Mercy fighting pretty much on her own with just one or two allies to rely on she is now married to alpha werewolf Adam . That hasn't always been plain sailing and being part of a pack isn't always easy. What with spoilt ex's and hostile wolves butting in Mercy has earned her position and quite rightly now feels the love that she deserves. Slight problem though as Mercy is still hurt by the Marrocks recent decision to set Adams pack free but what with Mercy offering help to all in the Tri cities area it's not exactly a surprise when trouble in the shape of foreign vampires decides to come knocking ( well technically it's shunting! ) at the packs door. With Mercy missing and obviously hurt Adam has to rally a force to rescue her but in a world where politics and treachery seems to trump all just how much clout will Adam have? Although regular readers will know that Mercy is frequently underestimated and quite capable of bringing chaos wherever she goes!I loved the way this was set out with a timeline that wiggles just right. The author keeps her readers on our collective toes and throws so much into this book. Yes Mercy is closely related to Coyote with inherent magic that marks her out as being anything but ordinary although as I read this I found myself questioning certain things . No I didn't quite get it all neatly worked out before the big reveal as the author clearly enjoys playing tricks herself ! Ms Briggs you are a wicked woman but boy can you write!This is my voluntary and honest opinion of an advance reader copy"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5375148-beth", "userReview": "Mercy is caught up in a vampire political power play that leaves her running for her life on an entirely different continent. Denied her biggest advantage, her friends and family, Mercy relies on her wits to traverse the vampires and the werewolves of Prague. Sometimes the lesser of two evils isn\u2019t always that best choice and some old ghosts are better left alone.This installment, Silence Fallen of Mercy Thompson inspired a re-read of the entire series.I know I am totally jumping the gun, but I couldn't wait to read more of Mercy and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. With each book, Briggs drags us deeper into the heart of Mercy's world and there is no slowing down for this series. Silence Fallen brings me back to the beginning when Mercy was facing everything mostly on her own. Just like then she is left stand by herself, but now we see the obvious character development and it is amazing. Mercy seeks alliances as soon as she gets the opportunity, and these alliances open an entire world that I would love to get to know even more...the European werewolves. Maybe another spin off.

With ten books in a series, it\u2019s hard to keep a series going and feeling fresh over the years but I think Patricia Briggs has done an excellent one with this series and in particular, this book.SILENCE FALLEN establishes the bond between the pack right before Mercy is kidnapped. This brings Stefan back into the picture and now Adam must work with the vampire in order to get Mercy back. In terms of writing, this book is slightly different than what Briggs usually does. For once, we get more of Adam and his POV as Briggs obviously has to go back and forth between both the pack and Mercy\u2019s POV to keep the story flowing.I loved this! I thought it brought so much fun to the series and in terms of the suspense, I think it had to be right up with there some of my other favorites from this series. You\u2019re just dying to get Mercy out of the hands of her kidnappers and this story actually reminded me a lot of another book in the series. I won\u2019t name it here in case you haven\u2019t read it but fans of the series would know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.SILENCE FALLEN is simply amazing.

With this latest installment told in multiple point of views of both Mercy, Adam and a certain Mr. Smith, Ms. Briggs really shook things up and breathed fresh life into a series that was already full of it. I think this might very well be a new favorite for me. I adored the different point of views and the dynamic of the characters and while I wish Mercy and Adam would have been together more because I adore them working as a team and as a couple, it was kind of fun to see them still working together but far apart from one another. Plus, hello, Europe people! As Mercy travels all over, it was fun to see the different packs and covens and how they worked in other countries. And even better we still get all the favorite characters from past books and even meet a few new ones that I truly hope we will be seeing more of in future installments.

Tensions are particularly strong in this novel as Mercy's mate, and the Alpha of her pack, Adam Hauptman has declared his territory a safe haven for all, including humans, and that his pack will fight to protect them. This action, leads to the pack's excommunication from The Marok--the head werewolf of all packs and Mercy's foster father.\u00a0In classic Mercy Thompson fashion the action starts from the very beginning of the story with Mercy being kidnapped by one of the most powerful European Vampires and Marsilia's old flame.\u00a0This of course sets off a whole chain of events both from the sly Mercy, who though slight in shifter size as a coyote, has a remarkable ability to fend for herself, and from Adam and his pack as well as all their supernatural allies. Witches, vamps, goblins, and more all come to Adam's aid to retrieve Mercy and bring her back home.\u00a0Just what is the motivation for this kidnapping and what the European vampire wants is not easy to discern though and along the way Mercy, in typical fashion, manages to get herself in further trouble. Can Adam and his allies save her? \u00a0Is Mercy truly helpless? And who are the real puppet masters at work and what does it mean for the werewolves and vamps and the whole host of other supernatural beings?\u00a0I enjoyed not only the phenomenal UF story and continued development of the already complex world of Mercy Thompson but also the underlying romance. Even after all these books it's so clear just how all encompassing and important Mercy is to Adam. And how much love and admiration is shared by each for the other. Having their mate bonds disturbed and silenced nearly makes him mad. And yet there is trust there and conviction that the other can fend for him or herself.\u00a0I can't wait to see what further magical delights Patricia Briggs continues to weave into this series that has become one of my all time favorite UF/PNR series!\u00a0Source: Review copy provided for review purposes."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37460315-karen", "userReview": "This book had had some pros and cons for me going into it.
