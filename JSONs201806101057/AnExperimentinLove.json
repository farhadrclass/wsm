She excels, in all her books, at the portrayal of not-so-likable people, and keeping the reader interested in them even as they're repelled. She said recently, when asked what advice she'd give to aspiring writers: \"Drop the charm. Eat meat, drink blood.\" She means it."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "I was so enchanted by Wolf Hall that I resolved to read Hilary Mantel's other novels. I had not heard of her before Wolf Hall won the Booker Prize and I don't think she was very well-known in the United States previously, but is highly respected in England. She has published ten novels, An Experiment in Love being her seventh. It is a sad, sad tale, very English and it reminded me of Anne Enright's The Gathering. Somehow, Mantel's writing just drags you into the hearts of her characters and keeps you there feeling all their sufferings, fleeting joys, hopes and confusions, as they move through their lives. It is actually excruciating but that is often just what I want in a novel. Carmel McBain comes from working class Irish-Catholic parents who settled in one of those mill towns in the Liverpool area (where the Beatles came from.) By the time their only child was born, the town was dying. Both parents worked and scrimped but Carmel's mother, in her own emtionally stunted way, pushed her daughter to aspire for more. This is a coming-of-age story of Carmel as she leaves her Catholic girlhood, goes to college in the 60s, learns about and lives through sex, love and birth control while she studies and starves on her scholarship grant. It is a familiar plot, this trajectory of a sheltered young woman moving into fuller life in the big wide treacherous world of late 20th century life.  The telling of the tale is what got me. From Shirley Jackson's Hangsaman to Prep by Curtis Sittenfeld, we get these stories that are almost the female side of the Holden Caufield thing. And the female experience is more fraught with emotional danger just because we are the second sex."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1170599-dan", "userReview": "This was a fine novel for me. The writing and the story telling are so bright and fast-moving I didn't want to put it down. The tale follows Carmel from her girlhood through a demanding Catholic school for 11-18-years olds, and into her college times in London. There is plenty of flavoring in this this Irish-Catholic background, and in the sense of poverty of pocket book and ideas of some of the characters, in the class issues and and in the sense of the times and places that are vastly different. Different from anything I remember in the same and even earlier time periods, an isolation. There is flavoring also in the wit of the narrator and the personalities of the young women as they come together in a group at the beginning of their college time. (I personally loved the narrator's law school references to cases like Hadley v. Baxendale, which all American contract students must know.) But all that's the flavoring, not the meat, even if the its necessary to the meat.What is the meat? I'm not telling. But I will say that Mantel can draw your eye to details that provide interest and support the plot and which you might mistake for the main point--like a magician who draws your eye away from the real action. Even the title might be ambiugous when you've finished the book.I wanted to read more and more, but I'm left to my own resources, and I find myself thinking about the book, even wanting to re-read it, ever since I finished the book last night. The last pages will prompt some thinking and I'll not spoil them. I'm not even going to describe in general terms the direction of the plot. Read it."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "This review could be 20 paragraphs long, that's how personal a connection this novel had for me in reaction. More than just enjoyable, at least 1/2 was outright LOL, literally. The descriptive mastery! Not an easy read, as there are 4 comparative context metaphors or some kind of nuance allusion or allegory to a paragraph, but what an effect! Also despite being in another country, the absolutely identical cultural context issues to the time we experienced are just incredible. Like the paper folded contraptions, for example, we played games with that she calls \"quackers\". We did the same on another continent. We folded them and worked them like beaks too, used them to tell our fortunes, like a Magic 8 Ball, some of you may remember. There was a fad for them that lingered for 2 or 3 years, just about as long as the hula hoop. Boys made them too. Hilary Mantel, IMHO, is the best Boomer generation female writer in that art of putting people into their core cultural context almost instantly. She is a genius. Not just with words, but within the memory of all 5 senses that she can relate per sentence. As she details within this book, when she is writing about herself that her past memory feels of fluffed fur more than any visual picture reel as in a movie. It's coming from all directions. Like the wool smell of wet uniforms, the chalk dust mixed with baloney sandwich meat smell. So many more here. And remembering the real shock when the 3 outfits you owned were all mini's and within a 1/2 year the mini's were out and you looked like a cartoon character if you tried to wear one within a room of 50 other girls in Midi's who also held \"5-6-9 Shop\" credit cards that you certainly didn't. Our \"Sophy's\" had another name. We used to call them \"the Canadians\" so that no one knew who were talking about. We didn't live in a welfare state though as Carmel does in this novel. So no school lunches, you ate what you carried in with you too, even if you were there for 15 hours straight. We had no gym and our exercise was getting there. (2 buses and a mile walk both before and after the boarding each way). In winter, we left in the dark and got home in the dark. Blizzards, still not allowed to wear pants either. I still know how to ride on the bottom step of the back door of a CTA bus. It was my \"place\". We were all skinny, but not as skinny as Carmel in this novel. That is where we differ the most. My family didn't own a car. The 17 year old \"Sophy's\" in my time drove their own. The same class and economic issues, precisely. And the contraceptive stories were nearly identical with this novel, but you needed to find your own doctor. None supplied. Regardless, we had a nun in Sophomore Year who illustrated sexual coitus in great detail on a blackboard so that no one could plead ignorance. Hilary would laugh. Many then and now still take the Sue (in the book) route, it seems, regardless. Hilary Mantel's description of what love is when she first hears Lynette's voice is one of the best I have ever come across. And it didn't take 3 tomes to get there either. Her fellowship between women quotient is just out of the stratosphere. Top tier writer- absolutely gifted and practiced.Here's to all of us, all we good Catholic girls everywhere who learned to love our Katrinas. And God too."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929592-jon", "userReview": "The writing in this short book captured and held me, even though the plot had little intrinsic interest for me. It's the experience of a working-class Catholic girl from the north of England being pushed into academic success by her ambitious mother in the late 1960s to 1970. It's a somber and sad first-person story, even though the narrator has reached, by the time of the writing, some form of happiness, integrity, and maturity. There are flashes everywhere of early feminism, social satire, Catholic religiosity, and political commentary. It's clear early on that the narrator's mysterious and lumpish friend Karina, who has unpleasantly shadowed her life since she was a little girl, is going to do something hostile and violent; but when the act finally comes, it is still a surprise, as are the narrator's responses to it. I have not seen anyone try to explain the significance of the book's title, which is tantalizingly ambiguous. There is very little of what is usually thought of as love in the novel, but much about loyalty and obligation in spite of mutual dislike, suspicion, and even hatred. A fascinating book. I enjoyed Wolf Hall, and I have Mantel's long novel set during the French revolution on my shelf. I plan to tackle it soon."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna", "userReview": "\u2018An Experiment in Love\u2019 is a novel that I expected to connect with more than in fact I did. It follows a girl called Carmel as she gets into a selective high school, has to have a whole fancy uniform that seems incredibly expensive, does well at school, goes off to university, and negotiates the novel freedom of living with a group of other young women for the first time. Although the narrative is set in the 1970s, I had all the aforementioned experiences myself in the 90s and 00s. Carmel is an interesting character and I liked that her friendships and emnities with women were the focus rather than her boyfriend. (He lurked stolidly in the background.) On the other hand, said relationships remained somehow mysterious and Carmel\u2019s first person narrative never quite hooked me. I found the treatment of her eating disorder odd and the tempo of events uneven. This wasn\u2019t any fault in the writing, which was beautiful, but perhaps had something to do with the memoir-ish structure. The narrative darts back and forth between school and university days, with no apparent rhyme or reason. This makes for a meditative rather than plot-driven novel.Now and again there was a magnificently acute paragraph, though. This one in particular:When men decided that women could be educated - this is what I think - they educated them on the male plan; they put them into schools with mottoes and school songs and muddy team games, they made them wear collars and ties. It was a way to concede the right to learning, yet remain safe; the products of the system would always be inferior to the original model. Women were forced to imitate men, and bound not to succeed at it.As I re-read that passage, I noticed that Carmel refers to women as \u2018they\u2019 not \u2018we\u2019. Perhaps that is what limited my engagement with this novel - her sense of detachment. Thus I was interested but not moved, when I expected both. Hilary Mantel is an incredible writer, though, so I am holding her to much higher standards than most. At the end of the edition I read is an interview in which she says that A Place of Greater Safety was the first novel she wrote, back in the 1970s. That\u2019s incredible! It\u2019s one of my all time favourite books and she wrote it while in her 20s, never having written a novel before. What talent."}, {"userName": "Sandra Lawson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2271837-sandra-lawson", "userReview": "An Experiment in Love is Carmel's story of her childhood somewhere near Manchester. She is educated at Catholic schools, earns a scholarship as a passport out of her working class background, and fetches up at university in London. Here she makes new friends from different classes and parts of the country, but fails to sever her ties with her school friends, who have joined her at the same hall of residence.Carmel reflects back on her life, prompted by a newspaper article about a friend and former co-student, but it is only when we approach the novel's end that we realise how her story, and her friend's profession, are linked, and can understand what has prompted Carmel's reminiscences.This is a coming of age biographical novel, told against a background of the 1960s and early 1970s, of girls leaving home for the first time and trying to live independently in London. We are vaguely aware of the wave of feminism that underpins the era, although these girls are having to work it out for themselves. As someone who was born in the same year as Hilary Mantel, I was also touched by the memories that are so relevant to the 1960s, especially the ritual of buying the first school uniform, and encountering school teachers who are quick to lash out with a ruler.T S Eliot famously stated that his past was part of his present, and this is acutely true of Carmel and her tale. She may have risen above her working class background, but she can never leave her former self behind."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1139860-kat", "userReview": "This book is often compared to Muriel Spark's The Girls of Slender Means, including by the characters in the book itself!!! But, while there are structural and thematic similarities: a narrator form \"the now\" recalls her younger self living in a residence hall for young women, a tragedy that takes the life of one of said women, etc., I find Mantel's book to be much better. It is less fragmented in its points of view (Carmel is the sole narrator), Carmel has a back story that is much more developed and poignant (heart-breaking really). There is a very interesting three way friendship/frenemship? between Carmel, her childhood friend Karina (an uncouth child of immigrants from an unspecified European country) and her high-school friend Julia(nne) (a sophisticated doctor's daughter). Carmel's descent into anorexia is not easily explained, the relationships between the various girls are complex. The \"now\" point of view, though very limited, hints that these young women were shaped by the events from the past (Julia, previously Julianne, is now a psychologist? doctor? treating anorexia, Carmel has married, but there is no mention of children). A well-written, complicated novel, IMHO superior to THe Girls of Slender Means."}, {"userName": "Sub_zero", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7645532-sub-zero", "userReview": "Hilary Mantel imprime en Experimento de amor su particular sello a las novelas de iniciaci\u00f3n.

I wondered why retread ground that Margaret Drabble and Lynne Reid Banks had already covered, of 1960s girls (although Mantel references Edna O'Brien and Muriel Spark) at or leaving university, emerging into a half-changed world? But Drabble and Reid Banks were nice middle class girls \u2013 Mantel's stand-in, Carmel, is doubly deprived as a working class woman.Mantel builds her world(s) magnificently with her usual dense, but never turgid prose: the pinched, grim, claustrophobic, small town, and the faux liberation of London, where Carmel lives in a pinched, grim, claustrophobic, small hall of residence for girls, where you can't negotiate over the price of the heating, cleaning, or food.There are some brilliant details, the girls who hand-wash their boyfriend's shirts and hang them out to dry in the communal bathrooms, to prove that they are not only clever and pretty, but can look after their men, the hand-stitched clothes worn by the young Carmel that show the aspiration that every babyboomer's parent wants for her child \u2013 to have a better life, so that she\u2019s not trapped in a marriage to a man she doesn\u2019t love, cleaning houses and never having enough.The lack that Carmel is subject to \u2013 of food, praise, affection \u2013 is something that she struggles against by taking even less, stopping eating, working too hard. Having less makes Carmel, in her eyes, more holy: she has already explained how the world teaches women to deprive themselves, from the mother who gives her husband the choice food and keeps the fatty meat for herself, to the school that teaches the women to be \u201cfoolish volunteers\u201d, to always be thinking of others: \u201cWomen, who \u2013 seeing an extra burden offered \u2013 would always step forward and suggest: Try me.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39443-christy", "userReview": "Following girls through their growth from middle school into high school and then into college.

Definitely a feminism air to the story, religious undertones since Carmel goes to a religious school and then ends up losing all belief in God.It was an interesting enough read, but the author left a lot unsaid which had to be inferred even in the ending and I had trouble with that.

We read about the entry of women into the workforce and how high ranking women often wear drab colors and suits in order to blend in and not threaten men by reminding them of their femininity (a rough paraphrase). This way of dressing also gives women freedom as they are free to embody characteristics and a style of dress originally denied to them. It was an interesting idea, one that I was familiar with but I never thought about the psychological reasons women wore \"power suits\", etc and I think Mantel hits the nail on the head with the above quote even though she's speaking about school girls. It's an example of Mantel's exemplary writing style and the well illustrated points about 60s English society that she weaves into her novel.While I found the writing to be elegant I wasn't engaged reading this novel. For the most part I was fairly bored, largely due to the detachment I felt from all the characters. It's a sad novel with messed up characters which I don't normally object to but I wish more of a motive had been given for the cruelty of Carmel's mother, the passivity of her father and Karina's hatred of everyone. Furthermore I perked up when Carmel mentioned dreams of being the first female prime minister, and then she abandons these dreams and I couldn't figure out why. Was it because she simply accepted that women couldn't reach that far in life during her time? Ultimately this bleak novel with haunting characters and language was well written albeit unable to hold my attention.Final quote: \"If you knew at twenty what you know at thirty-five, what a marvellous life you could have; on the other hand, you might find that you couldn't be bothered to have any life at all\" (75)."}, {"userName": "spherical.cat", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41995359-spherical-cat", "userReview": "Hilary Mantel's portrayal of the highly-charged interactions among young women contains traces of Tudor politics: powerplay, backstabbing and a very thin line between friends and enemies. The novel charts the coming-of-age of Carmel McBain, who many years later is sifting through her memory. Carmel leaves a working-class home, a convent education, and a domineering mother for college, just as England enters the Thatcher era. Accompanying her is Karina, a longtime schoolmate who has been selected as a 'friend' by their mothers. The term 'frenemy' has never been more apt. In a hostel that resembles a draughty hospital, Carmel and Karina grapple with poverty, stress, 'girl-politics' and boyfriends. All these are sharply observed and unsparingly written. The supporting cast include vivacious Julia, angelic rich girl Lynette and various other classmates desperate to shed innocence. They pin their hopes on education to help them live life on their own terms, but realize that women's lib still has frustratingly long way to go, echoing Mantel's own experiences in her memoir 'Giving Up The Ghost.' Each character (even a minor one) is convincing, their fears and conversations almost disturbingly real. Anorexia is a major theme. Carmel gets thinner, Karina fatter, their relationship more brittle. Slowly, the memories move to the tragedy. Mantel's prose glitters with detail, it is full of lovely similes and imagery. There is something poignant about the descriptions, Carmel's memories and experiences are recognizable, in fact too much so. It is also very funny in places. However, throughout the book the main effect is some sense of foreboding.

Increasingly Karina is described as being greedy, as having \"lard-soaked fingers\". Friends all seem to dislike Karina, and no-one notices that Carmel is starving herself to near- death. Julianne, however, is thriving, doing everything right. It is a slow read, interesting and deceptive- who really has the emotional problems here? Carmel's mother was determined that she succeed, and she gets to university, but at what cost to her mental well- being? Add to this the description of live at the university for the girls, the poor food, the boyfriends being smuggled in, the abortions, and finally, tragedy.Hilary Mantel's book is slow going but worth it./ A meticulous insight into friendship and family."}, {"userName": "Fiona", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1208258-fiona", "userReview": "\"You're only young once, they say, but doesn't it go on for a long time? More years than you can bear.\"What was it like, being a female student in 1970? Carmel, Karina and Julia are all at university in London together. They live in a Halls of Residence. None of them are very nice people. But I loved this book, loved the descriptions of the small Lancashire town they come from, of London, of hunger, of poverty, of convent education. It reminded me of The Bell Jar.In chapter seven, Mantel writes about the education of women at that time. How they were educated to become second-rate versions of men, how confusing it was, how instead of becoming educated women, they became a third, middle sex, \"without the powers of men or the duties of women.\""}, {"userName": "Neanderthal", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20167255-neanderthal", "userReview": "Lynnett said to me, 'How very short your hair is! But it shows off your beautiful eyes.'  I could see that Julianne had also fallen in love. I think women carry this faculty into later life: the faculty for love, I mean. Men will never understand it till they stop confusing love with sex, which will be never. Even today, there are ten or twenty women I love: for a turn of phrase or wrist, for a bruised-looking ankle where the veins have blossomed out, for a squeeze of the hand or for a voice on the end of the phone. I would no more go to bed with any of them than I would drown myself; and drowning is my most feared form of death. Perhaps I love too easily; I can say Lynnette has left a mark on my heart.

This is set predominately in 1960s London at a girls college. It's wonderful and complicated and nuanced and slow (like \"Wolf Hall,\" \"An Experiment in Love\" took me more time to read than its pages fully accounted for). It's a coming of age novel, but not a trite one. There are very dark angles that Mantel utilizes but never fully shines her light on. Which leaves the reader wondering \"Was that fucked up? Or REALLY fucked up?\" and feeling like they too are looking back from the safety of middle age, puzzling out the events that shaped them."}, {"userName": "Katherine Hebert", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8224774-katherine-hebert", "userReview": "Spot-on writing about young women in college in the 60s, away from home for the first time , pushed by parents who scrimped and saved so they could go to school and land a better life---somewhere between marriage and being the prime minister of England. Young women who have to figure out on their own how to live with birth control, sexual freedom, pregnancy, religion, anorexia, the inability to connect with parents, friendships, hatred, violence, and financial issues including starvation when the scholarship money runs out. Smart narrative that flips back and forth between past and present; amazingly complex characterization."}], "description": "Hilary Mantel's seventh novel examines the pressures on women during the 1960s to excel--but not be too successful--in England's complex hierarchy of class and status. Pushed by a domineering mother, Carmel McBain climbs her way through the pecking order and ends up at London University as an acquiescent and undernourished teenager, achieving the status so desired by her mother, but too weak to make use of it or pose a threat to anyone. Though this is Carmel's story, it reflects on a generation of girls desiring the power of men, but fearful of abandoning what is expected and proper.", "title": "An Experiment in Love", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101926.An_Experiment_in_Love", "average": 3.64, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312023506l/101926.jpg", "reviews": 192, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/58851.Hilary_Mantel", "name": "Hilary Mantel"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "European Literature", "Literary Fiction", "Young Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101926.An_Experiment_in_Love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/626622.An_Experiment_in_Love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2233850.An_Experiment_In_Love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1161248.An_Experiment_in_Love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28108967-experimento-de-amor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29599963-experimento-de-amor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2873998-an-experiment-in-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6101138-wolf-hall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13507212-bring-up-the-bodies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101921.A_Place_of_Greater_Safety", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20563988-the-assassination-of-margaret-thatcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101923.Beyond_Black"]}
