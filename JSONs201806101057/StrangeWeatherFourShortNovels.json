Only the rational counterargument was a pile of shit, and I knew it. I just didn\u2019t want to know it.\nJoe Hill has taken a break between epic horror novels to put together a collection of four novellas under the title Strange Weather. The title seems an afterthought, frankly. Only one of the stories actually incorporates weather that is certifiably strange. But, no matter. Don\u2019t go looking for story one to relate to story two to story three to story four. There are some links, but they are minimal. Read each tale on its own. The stories were written here and there, between this and that, over several years. Joe Hill - from his site\n Maturity is not something that happens all at once. It is not a border between two countries where once you cross the invisible line, you are on the new soul of adulthood, speaking the foreign tongue of grown-ups. It is more like a distant broadcast, and you are driving toward it, and sometimes you can barely make it out through the hiss of static while other times the reception momentarily clears and you can pick up the signal with perfect clarity.\nSnapshot focuses on loss of memory, but not in the usual way. A thuggish agent, The Phoenician, stalks a town, uses a Polaroid-like camera to extract recollections. An eleven-year-old boy is charged with taking him on, which will feel familiar to those of you who have read NOS4A2, a good-soul everykid being confronted with adult challenges. It is a chilling story, tucking a bildungsroman into a nightmare experience, while taking on the very real horror of dementia. If we are our memories, then what are we when those memories are gone?\nLoaded is the oldest story in the book. I\u2019ve had that one in my head ever since the massacre of twenty children in Newtown, Connecticut. - from the AfterwordLoaded, takes on the very real-life horror of gun violence and death by cop, even death by mall cop, focusing on the bad things that can happen when one mixes fear, paranoia, bigotry, and greed, with ready access to ordnance. Randall Kelloway is a mall guard, a wannabe cop who keeps getting rejected from the police force for the very good reason that he is psychologically unfit. He is also in deep poo in his home life, having earned an Order of Protection for dangerous behavior with his ex and child. He is inordinately fond of guns, and imagines himself using them to heroic purpose. When a violent situation unfolds at the mall, guns blaze. When Randy emerges from the smoke he is seen as the white knight he always imagined himself to be. Aisha is a reporter, who suspects that the mall shooting may not have gone down quite the way Randall said, and digs relentlessly to find out the truth. Hill uses an encroaching brush fire (common in the real Florida in which this is set) to add to the constant ramp-up of tension. Although it can feel didactic at times, Loaded may be the most effective horror story of the collection, as it is the one we are likeliest to encounter in real life. Hill relies on flawed, corrupted humanity instead of the supernatural to jangle your nerves, and succeeds in hitting his target.\nYou knew what was real not by its qualities but by its imperfections\nAloft is the most Twilight Zone-like of the collection. Aubrey Griffin is trying to impress a young lady, a band-mate, Harriet. Their friend, June, had passed recently and they, with others, are honoring June by doing things on her bucket list. Sadly, Aubrey is scared out of his wits by the impending parachute jump, and is about to bail. But the plane loses power, mysteriously. Probably something to do with the UFO-like cloud formation they had spotted a short time earlier. Aubrey has to bail for real. But before his chute can open, he makes a relatively soft landing on something that is not exactly solid ground. This is not your typical UFO, being a mile or so long, having a malleable surface and the very non-UFO-like capacity to make one\u2019s wishes real. Which is where we get into the content portion of our program. What if you could have whatever you wanted, physically? Of course, there is that pesky element of core beneath the surface, and coming to grips with what one wants, and what one can and cannot have. A thoughtful piece, although not particularly scary. At the end, there is a mention of New Hampshire, where Hill lives, making one wonder how much of Joe was in Aubrey.\n I think Rain arose from a desire to spoof myself and my own sprawling end-of-the-world novel, The Fireman. I\u2019m a big believer in making fun of yourself before anyone else can.\nRain is a shorter example of the sort of post-apocalyptic sci-fi romp Hill has done so well in the longer form. But the rain that falls is a hard, and it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard, and it\u2019s a hard rain indeed. No squishy oobleck for Hill, nosiree. His rain arrives in crystalline needles, ones that penetrate instead of melting. Twenty-something Honeysuckle Speck regularly babysits for nine-year-old Templeton Blake, a kid with some medical issues. He likes to call himself Little Dracula and Honeysuckle loves him. Good thing he is a mostly at-home kid, as vast numbers of those caught outside when the first hard rain arrives fail to make it back inside. The story follows Honeysuckle as she tries to get from Boulder to Denver to get news to the father of a dear friend, enduring some of the horrors one might expect in a road trip story, and some you might not.There are characters to engage with in every tale. The pre-teen in Snapshot is a classic Hill/King kid who must test his mettle against the hostilely weird. Readers who have not always been members of the ins all their lives will relate. Aisha gives us someone worth rooting for in Loaded. Aubrey, in Aloft, offers a pretty relatable example of unrequited attraction, and Honeysuckle, in Rain, checks all the boxes for a post-apocalyptic heroine, without the Disney songs. If you are looking for the sort of large-scale epic horror story that Hill has produced with The Fireman and NOS4A2, you will be disappointed. If, however, you go into Strange Weather expecting material more like his short story work, as in 20th Century Ghosts, you should be pleased. Hill will take you from Ice 9 to Cloud 9, from fear to wonder, giving you some good nightmare material and a few sparks to spur a bit of introspection. The forecast is for good reading ahead.

The only reason this wasn't a 5 star read for me was due to the fact that the first story (SNAPSHOT) underwhelmed me quite a bit. It didn't seem to fit with the other three, but that could just be a case of personal taste and opinion. Other than that, these stories contained a slow building sense of dread and disturbance that felt gritty and unsettling; of course, this is what we look for in a Joe Hill production so that was welcomed and expected! While I enjoyed all three remaining stories, I felt LOADED disturbed me the greatest as it hit home with all the mass shootings we've seen in recent times. That said, I do believe my favorite story, based purely on enjoyment, was RAIN. I'm not sure what the final arrangement of all four stories will be in the finished copies, but with the way they are set now, it seemed that they started mildly and grew slowly in suspense and unsettling nature until we reach the end. I really liked how that felt and hope the publisher decides to keep everything as is. Final verdict? Joe Hill has done it again and I highly recommend this to folks who enjoy a little extra thinking with their disturbing content. This is intellectual horror at its best. ****************************YAAASSSS!!!

However, none is less than riveting reading, provoke thought and entertain. In Snapshot, a young boy faces his nightmares, the menace of dementia, and the challenge that is the tattooed Phoenician, a thug with a polaroid camera, a camera which snaps and erases memories. Loaded is a story with the capacity to emotionally tear you apart. Its focus is guns and gun violence as it explores the scenarios that lie behind the use of guns by cops. A reporter suspects all is not as it should be in a mall shooting and its apparent hero. Aloft moves us into more supernatural territory, as Aubrey Griffin's fear of parachuting has to be surmounted as circumstances change drastically. He finds himself landing on a weird cloud in the sky. Rain is a shift to a dystopian post-apocalyptic time with a terrifying and killer rain that penetrates skin and has devastating effects. Honeysuckle Speck undertakes a horrifying road trip from Boulder to Denver. A collection of odd stories that grip and capture the imagination.

I find it difficult to understand how a man who tried so hard to hide the fact that he was Stephen King\u2019s son so that he could earn his own success would then turn around and try so hard to emulate his father\u2019s career after the cat was out of the bag. Because, like THE FIREMAN before it, this collection of novellas has Stephen King written all over it. Three of the four novellas might as well have been King short stories lengthened well past their expiration date. But enough of how Joe Hill has drifted into cruise control on his way over Inheritance Highway and onto the reviews.SNAPSHOT \u2013 This first novella overstays its welcome by about thirty pages. The first half of the story is okay. Boring and predictable, sure, but it\u2019s at least readable. The second half is\u2026 well, sports fans, I don\u2019t know what the fuck it is. It was hard to stay awake while reading those last thirty pages, that\u2019s for sure. Hill gets lost in sentimentality and forgets to entertain us. We\u2019re left with a bloated Stephen King short story on par with \u201cChattery Teeth\u201d and \u201cThe Monkey\u201d. Imagine those stories but at twice the length and you\u2019re left with the swollen colon that is SNAPSHOT, a story that serves no other purpose but to suppose an everyday item has supernatural powers. Great for a tale of twenty or thirty pages, but not ninety. The supernatural powers aren\u2019t all that surprising, nor is the ending, but the main issue is that the idea simply does not excuse the length. One star.LOADED \u2013 Ever wanted to read about someone who\u2019s anti-gun debate themselves for 140 pages? Yeah, me neither. I think we need gun reform. I feel that gun violence has gotten well and truly out of control. There is, I feel, no need for automatic weapons whatsoever. If you cannot defend your home with a handgun or shotgun because your aim is bad and you believe being able to shoot faster makes you safer, you shouldn\u2019t own a gun to begin with. I myself own a gun because I'm in an interracial relationship, my kids two children are mixed, and we live in the rebel-flag-fetish that is the American South, and our lives have been threatened more than once by hillbilly ammosexuals like the ones in this book. That being said, I don\u2019t want someone preaching to my choir for what amounts to about 40,000 words. Beyond the rhetoric and politics, there\u2019s issues with the very foundation of the story. The plausibility of the camera problem in this book is just plain dumb. The coincidence bothers me. Had the recording been destroyed on purpose, cool beans. But for all this to be left to fate\u2026 I gotta call bullshit. Everything comes out in the wash and is explained, but not to my liking. The ending of the story, however, took an Easter-basket-sized sack of testicles to write, so I applaud Hill for that. Other than that, this novella is simply okay. Three stars (mostly for the ending).ALOFT \u2013 Now THIS is what I\u2019m talking about. ALOFT is what the fuck I signed up for when I became a Joe Hill fan. Not his insistence on emulating his father and recreating his legacy. Not the stripped-down, flavorless writing. Not his politics. I signed up for this man\u2019s gorgeous fucking imagination, the same imagination that gave us stories like \u201cPop Art\u201d and \u201cYou Will Hear the Locust Sing\u201d (even though the latter is nothing more than a modern retelling of Kafka\u2019s THE METAMORPHOSIS), and novels like Horns and NOS4A2 (or NOS4R2 for those of you in the UK). Joe Hill has an even better imagination than his old man. At the very least, his imagination is more fun than King\u2019s. King has written some doozies in his time, but he\u2019s never written anything like ALOFT. I don\u2019t even want to talk about what this story is about. Just know that I loved every word, sentence, paragraph, page, and chapter of this novella. More of this, please and thank you! Five stars.And finally\u2026\u2026sigh\u2026RAIN \u2013 Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me this was a joke? The experience of this novella would have been much better had I known this was Joe Hill making fun of himself. But, no, it\u2019s not until you read the afterword that Hill explains that RAIN is his attempt at parodying himself. Who the fuck told him this was a good idea? I\u2019ve written some bad books and terrible short stories, I\u2019ve even ripped them apart publicly, but I\u2019d never write an entire novella making fun of myself. The problem here is that I took the story seriously because I imagined that\u2019s what it was; serious fiction about the end of the world. Parts of this final novella have big heart, but then the last few chapters come along and turn an anti-Trump campaign about crystal nails falling from the sky into a fucking SNL sketch. What. The actual. Fuck. Ya wanna know what I think? I think Hill didn\u2019t know how to end this book, so he penciled the goofiest shit he could think of and then wrote in the afterword that it was all for shits and giggles. He couldn\u2019t think of an ending, so we\u2019re left with an author mocking himself for writing THE FIREMAN. What an asshole. This closing novella might just put me off Joe Hill for a while. Two stars.In summation: I\u2019m going to stop buying the ebook versions of his stuff. I\u2019ve been buying a hardcover, audiobook, ebook, and the eventual paperback of everything Hill\u2019s written, like I do with King, but no more. After the shit-parade that was THE FIREMAN and now the gem-speckled-garbage-float that is STRANGE WEATHER, I\u2019m done over-supporting this dude. Hill hasn\u2019t earned the respect I have for his father, so he\u2019s going on restriction until he does better. I'm still rooting for you, man, but I need you to do better, please.

Rather than dwell on monsters and ghosts, the most terrifying aspect of Strange Weather was simply the horror of the human psyche, and how far people will go to inflict pain upon others. I'll be breaking this up by story, as I typically do with novella reviews. I've combined the content warnings and will add them all at the end of the review, for efficiency's sake. I'm placing these in order of how they are positioned in the ARC, but the final copy may differ.\n\nSNAPSHOT - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606The idea that these days had been taken from her struck me as vile. It was a swallow of curdled milk. It was indecent.\n\nSnapshot, the first of four novellas, tells a man's boyhood memories of the strange man with the polaroid, and the bizarre things that each photo took along with it. I found this to be my least favorite story in the book, though it was still awfully horrifying to think of a camera that could take away more than just a photo. I found myself undeniably on edge from start to finish, and found it to be an unsettling, unique entrance to the collection.\n\nLOADED - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605All it took to turn a CD into a knife or a tape gun into a .45 was a little imagination, a little panic, and a lot of prejudice.\n\nI have no words for how stunned I was when I realized what a blatantly political direction Joe was taking this story in. Loaded is a perspective-changing story that follows in the wake of mass shootings, and tells of police brutality, racism, gun fanaticism, and hate. The villains in this story are so over the top that you find yourself desperately wanting not to believe in them, despite the fact that, as a citizen of the southern states, I can certainly assure you that I have heard many of these arguments from acquaintances in my own life. (Note: I'm not interjecting politics into this, and will leave my thoughts on gun ownership out of this, but we've all met at least one person who took things too far, and that's what's happening in this story.)Loaded absolutely destroyed me. I have never in my life cried through a horror story, yet I could hardly regain composure in one moment before the next event had me sobbing again. The hatred in the villain's heart left me hollow. This was the most horrifying story I have ever read, yet not a moment of it felt like fiction, particularly in the wake of the shootings we've seen over the last few years.\n\nALOFT - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Everything gets very surreal when you're falling from twelve thousand feet.\n\nFirst of all, if you have a fear of heights, this story may not be one you want to take lightly. I don't even have acrophobia, and I still found my stomach turning at many of this story's descriptive moments. When Aubrey's skydiving experience goes wrong, he finds himself in a very interesting set of circumstances, and... well, I'll let you go into this one blind, but trust me, you're in for a really unique (and bizarre) ride.\n\nRAIN - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605When the rain fell, most everyone was caught outside in it. You wonder, maybe, why so many people died in that initial downpour.\n\nIn Rain, we watch the beginning of an apocalypse through the eyes of a young woman named Honeysuckle. As a rain of crystalline needles kills Honeysuckle's girlfriend and nearly all of her neighbors, she sets off on a journey to inform her father-in-law of his daughter's passing, only to be hunted by members of a local religious cult. As she tries to navigate the empty streets of Denver and avoid being slashed to bits by the next storm, she finds herself in a spiral of terrorism conspiracies.Like Loaded, this story hit way too close to home for comfort, though not on nearly as intense of a level. Joe let his politics shine through once more with a few catty remarks about a president who's a little too twitter-happy, and I found myself laughing despite the nature of the tale. Of course, you're never left smiling for long when it comes to a Joe Hill book, but I found this to be a fantastic rounding-out of the collection.All in all, Strange Weather averaged out to a 4.75 rating, which I obviously will \nhappily\n round up to 5 stars for my favorite horror author. Now, I'm only sad that I have to wait for his next release!Content warnings: fat-phobia, ableism, homophobia, racism, police brutality, gun fanaticism, sexism, spousal abuse, child death, extreme violence, religious fanaticism/occultism.All quotes are taken from an ARC and may have been changed for the final publication.

It consists of four short novels, (Joe Hill dislikes the term novella), and I enjoyed them all! Snapshot  is a story about memory and a camera that steals them. Set in the 80's with a teenage boy as the protagonist, this story packed some powerful imagery along with a bit of nostalgia for good measure.  Loaded  is a tale about guns. Joe Hill says it's not political, but I think that both pro gun and anti gun proponents will bring their own views to the party. I tried to keep my politics out of it and enjoy it for the fast paced horror story that it was. Oh yeah, and the ending was KILLER.  Aloft  was the story of a man on a cloud. It wasn't cloud 9, in fact, it wasn't a cloud at all, really. What imagination and creativity this story showed! I can't seem to put my finger on why this tale appealed to me so much, but the fact remains that it did. It reminded me somewhat of Hill's short story  Pop Art , in that the tale doesn't break its back trying to provide explanations or reasons why...it just IS. And what it IS, is fantastic. (Junicorn!) Rain  was my favorite story in the book. The protagonist, Honeysuckle Speck, was one of the most interesting characters I've ever met. She is so much more than what you first suspect and I would love to read more about her in the future. It's hard to say what one would do if the sky suddenly began raining sharp crystal nails. I would love to think that I would act with the same bravery and smarts as Honeysuckle did, but I suspect I don't have the strength. Hill says in the Afterword that this book was sort of his anti-Fireman story, but one thing they both have in common is strong female characters and I like that. I like it a lot. I received a digital review copy of this book from Edelweiss, but I also received my own (signed) copy, (whoohoo!),courtesy of Joe Hill at a book festival. This gave me a chance to check out the VERY cool illustrations, before and after each story, and also the little icons at the top of each page. They give the book a unique look and feel.I've come to love and admire Hill's work over the last few years and I think he has developed a strong voice, independent of, but respectful, of his father's.  Strange Weather  was worth every minute of my time and I'm sure I'll be devoting more time by reading it again in the future.Highly recommended!You can get your copy here: Strange Weather: Four Short Novels*Thank you to Edelweiss and to the publisher, (who I unabashedly emailed for the e-ARC of this awesome book), in exchange for my honest review.

Joe Hill seriously has a deal with the devil, because he can do no wrong.Four beautiful and haunting novellas, each dealing in their own way with \"strange weather\": a rain of crystal needles, flashes of 'lightning' that are missing their thunder, suspiciously shaped clouds, and raging fire tornadoes. Each story stands alone beautifully, but together they make a great collection. Let's take this story by story, shall we?\nSnapshot\n 4/5\nShe gripped my wrist. Her body was still stout and big-bosomed, but her hand was as bony and clawlike as a fairy-tale crone\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t let him take a picture of you. Don\u2019t let him start taking things away.\u201d\nThis is probably the only thing I've read by Hill that gave me strong Stephen King vibes. A young boy with an affinity for tinkering accidentally crosses a menacing stranger with a Polaroid Solarid camera that does a little more than take pictures. I really didn't find the Phoenician that scary, but the camera was a very cool concept. Shelly's plight was sad and beautifully told.It does go on a little long though. The story felt like it wanted to end, then kept going for another 15 or 20 pages. Which is probably another reason I was getting King vibes.\nLoaded\n 4.5/5\nEveryone knew the drill, had seen it all on TV. Get down, be ready to run if the shooter comes in sight.\nA perfect storm of PTSD, revenge, racism, and violence leads to a shooting at a mall. A security guard becomes a hero in the aftermath, but reporter Aisha Lanternglass knows something is off. Both of their pasts heavily influenced by gun violence, their stories intersect and unravel in horrific fashion.This one hit me hard. I have personally cowered in a classroom during a lockdown, trying desperately to call my mother, while SWAT team members dressed in black swarmed the sidewalks outside. Thankfully no one was killed that day, but I remember every detail, clear as day. It was terrifying and surreal, and this story brought back some uncomfortable memories.It was a captivating story for sure. And that ending! It pissed me off SO much, but the good kind of pissed off. It's provocative and challenging, and will stick with you.\nAloft\n 5/5\nFear thickens time, turns it slow and viscous. One second of deeply felt terror lasts longer than ten regular seconds.\nAloft is probably my favorite of the four. To honor a friend's memory, Aubrey and several friends go skydiving. Despite his fear of heights, Aubrey is determined to tough it out. He doesn't want to look weak in front of his longstanding crush, Harriet. But when he and his jump instructor leap from the plane, they never hit the ground.Suddenly Aubrey is stranded on a cloud that isn't a cloud. He has no food or water, but whatever else he might need, the cloud provides. Other than letting him go, that is. And there's something the cloud doesn't want him to know.It's imaginative, odd, and introspective. We get to go deep in Aubrey's head, much like the cloud does. It's a fascinating story. And the ending was perfect. Joe Hill does great endings.\nRain\n 4/5\n\u201cClimate change, my ass! This isn\u2019t climate change!\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what else you\u2019d call it. It used to rain water. Now it\u2019s raining blades of silver and gold. That is a change of climate.\u201d Teasdale rubbed a thumb against his chin, then said, \u201cGhosts is next.\u201d\u201cYou think it\u2019s going to rain ghosts?\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ll have ghosts instead of fog.\"\nThis is an apocalyptic story featuring a rain of crystal nails (synthetically engineered fulgurite, to be exact.) Honeysuckle looses her girlfriend in the first violent shower of needles and everything keeps falling apart from there.It's maybe the most traditional horror in the collection. World falling apart, bodies everywhere, dead lover, utter chaos; nothing that hasn't been done before, but it's done well. And man, there was a heck of a twist that I didn't see coming!So, Strange Weather knocks it out of the park with four great novellas. Joe Hill has yet to disappoint me. Like, HOW DOES HE WRITE SO GOOD?Every bit of this was a delight to read, and I'm thrilled to say that one of my most anticipated reads of 2017 did not disappoint.---------------------PRE-REVIEW:It's fall and new Joe Hill novellas are here and I am reading them.

Everything the author wants to do with the story, the setting, the characters has to be done in an efficient & concise manner--there aren't any words wasted; everything counts.Not all stories have to be novel length--some stories want to be told quickly and urgently.I think it's good for everyone to go into these stories blind, so I'm not going to go into details at all on the plots of each one. I'll just say that the last two stories were my favorite. I loved the main character, Aubrey in Aloft so much. He felt like someone I would know and be friends with--there were some moments that made me laugh out loud too. Which is great because I saw Joe Hill on The Fireman Tour and the man is hilarious-so I love when that sense of humor comes out in his writing.And the last story, Rain was scary. We've seen all the natural disasters we could ever see, except this one. Loaded had this one scene in that made me happy because for the longest time, I thought Joe Hill was going to take after his father and just plain suck at sex scenes, but I think there's hope for Hill, yet.Lastly, our front runner out of the gate, Snapshot, the first story with some great feels. Punches you in the gut a little.I loved it. Great protagonist too.Anyhoodles,Not going to say too much because this is a way in advance review. Everyone needs to buy this! Joe Hill fans will LOVE IT!!"}, {"userName": "Zoeytron", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron", "userReview": "[Some mothers have a skewed notion of how to protect their kids.

For those interested in a brief synopsis of each story... keep reading. If not, skip ahead! The first story, Snapshot, is about a young boy's encounter with a villain who robs his victim's memories by taking Polaroids of them. The second, Loaded, tells the story of a mall security guard who is believed to have stopped a mass shooting, but his story quickly unravels... Aloft, the third story, is a unique tale about a skydiver who lands on a very strange cloud in the sky. Finally, the last story, Rain, tells of an apocalypse wherein literal nails fall from the sky as rain. Pretty interesting collection of stories!I do enjoy a short story or a short novel... as Joe Hill himself says, it's all killer, no filler. However, I wish that could be said for these stories. I loved being back with Joe Hill, but ultimately felt like some of these stories just dragged on a little bit?The first story, Snapshot, was one of my favourites. A really strong opener for the collection. It was the perfect length with the perfect message. Emotionally charged too!As for Loaded... I have mixed feelings. It started really strongly, I was loving it... but it just kept going on and on. And the main protagonist was just a really hateful person. Then the ending straight-up pissed me off. I do however appreciate what Hill is trying to say with this story with regards to gun violence in America.The third story, Aloft, was so unique and original! A really enchanting and intriguing idea from Hill. But again, really felt like I lost some interest in the middle.The final story, Rain, was a terrifying concept. Nails literally fall from the sky as rain... destroying everything in its path. I was revelling in his descriptions of the post-apocalyptic world. Hill even admits in the afterword that it's a spoof of his own work - I do love when an author can poke fun at themselves.Overall, I did really enjoy this collection, I love Hill's style of writing and pop culture references. He also can write a sex scene so much better than his father! But I did feel like some stories perhaps could have been trimmed slightly. Although, I wonder if this is because I read this collection on my kindle, and I'm really not a fan of reading on my kindle. Maybe I would have enjoyed some of the stories slightly more if I was reading a physical copy. I'd give this collection 4 stars out of 5! Some really fresh ideas in here. I'm happy to have new Joe Hill!"}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "$3.99 on kindle US.

None of the stories are similar and range from horror to science fiction. He showcases his creative mind and also his political thoughts/viewpoints.The book begins with Snapshot. This is set in the 80's and has a teenage boy as the protagonist. The \"Phoenician\" takes Polaroid pictures and in doing so his camera erases memories. I actually thought I would like this one the best as it felt more like a horror book/novel/story. It was slow to start for me. I kept putting the book down and then came back to it. Things do take off in this story and when I thought it would be over, it wasn't.Loaded is about a security guard stops a mass shooting and becomes a hero but is the spotlight too much? Will he unravel? What connection does a mass shooting have to a ten year old and her cousin? Spanning twenty years this story/novel felt political. Gun control - pro/against. People are passionate about this issue and it felt like Hill was making a point.Aloft is where a man parachutes to impress a woman and in memory of his friend but instead of landing on earth he lands on what appears to be a UFO. Dare, I say that this felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone. From the beginning things felt like something was not going to go right. Aubrey is scared and things go downhill from there. This becomes a type of relationship where one being is happy with the arrangement and the other is not. Rain is about nails falling from the sky instead of water droplets. Honeysuckle watches as her girlfriend dies and sets off to inform her girlfriends's father only to be hunted by a religious cult. Yep, this one is political as well - A President making threats on Twitter, Cults, Terrorists, Russians, etc. One plus, Honeysuckle is a strong female character.As I said, I thought I would like snapshot the most. It turned out I enjoyed Aloft the most and also Rain. Loaded was my least favorite. I enjoyed the concept of 4 novels in one book, but honestly, I prefer a longer novel overall."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Well, it took me nearly the entire 21 day checkout period to finish this audio collection, but I did it and I think listening was the right way for me to go. That\u2019s not a comment I make lightly either since my drive time is so short and my attention span much like someone most are familiar with . . . . \nI\u2019ve repeated ad nauseum that short stories aren\u2019t my bag, but the novella on the other hand??? Those could be my bread and butter. Joe Hill gives a great explanation for why the novella works so well in his afterward. You get the benefit of a fully fleshed out story, but nary a paragraph can be wasted if you want to keep the reader invested. The bonus (for me at least) in a collection of novellas is the fair to middling selections are easily dismissed and soon-to-be forgotten while the good ones will stay with you, quite possibly for a lifetime. Hill\u2019s father\u2019s The Body and Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption being a couple of perfect examples.So without further ado let's talk about the first selection in Strange Weather called \u201cSnapshot:\u201d This was my first experience listening to an audiobook performed by . . . . . \nAnd now I never want anyone else to ever read to me again. Ever. I fell in love with Wil Wheaton when I was just a little kid and he made me wish I was a boy coming of age in 1960 . . . . \nHe\u2019s held a special place in my memories ever since. Fitting that \u201cSnapshot\u201d happens to be one about memory. 5 Stars for Wheaton\u2019s performance, but 3 for the story itself which I thought would have been much more powerful if it had concluded at the end of Part 1 of the audio and the \u201cPhoenician\u201d and his \u201cSolarid\u201d camera being an imagined boogeyman conjured by the mind of a woman suffering from dementia rather than him actually being one. Props to Joe Hill for the Stand By Me soundtrack shout-out, however. That will be the selection that plays me through my workday today for sure. I automatically assumed \u201cLoaded\u201d would be a miss for me since I prefer to keep my fiction and political opinions as separated as possible, but dagnabbit . . . . \nI\u2019m still not interested in discussing gun rights EVER on social media, but talk about a story that kept me hooked from start to finish. Every star. (I do have to say the narrator chose a pretty weak delivery for the main female voice and that sucks because she wasn\u2019t some Mary Sue.)Which leads us to \u201cAloft\u201d \u2013 a story about a guy who nearly shits his pants before jumping out of an airplane and ends up actually shitting his pants at some point after landing on a cloud . . . .\nSorry. I just can\u2019t. 1 Star. Last but most certainly not least is \u201cRain.\u201d Narrated by Red, I had pretty high expectations for this one due to the choice of reader alone . . . . .\n(Does anyone else tune in just to see what she\u2019s reading??? That one she\u2019s reading right there is a good\u2019un.)Anyway, again I\u2019m happy to report this did not disappoint. The narration was great, Honeysuckle was great, and what can I say about the story itself????\n4 Stars.I\u2019m giving 3.5 Stars to the collection in its entirety.

My favorite story was the first one by a long shot. The Polaroid man was such a cool concept for a villain. I wish I could've learned more about his history and about the metal that made his camera, especially at the end when the melted metal spoke. It almost sounded like the voice of Sauron in my head. Like the one ring was melted down and turned into a camera. The second story was disturbing but was also incredibly well written and politically charged. The stories in order of favorite to least favorite goes 1,2,4,3. I just couldn't get into Aloft. It had some vivid imagery and great backstory but I just couldnt get into it. It was the only story that had a moment where I was bored. Snapshot, Loaded, and Rain were non-stop action and thrills. Loaded had the best characters of the three. Snapshot was the most original with the most potential and the coolest villain concept.Rain had its ups and downs but I was never bored."}, {"userName": "Paul O'Neill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17331573-paul-o-neill", "userReview": "A fantastic collection of novellas from Joe Hill, all with their own unique feel and a loose link to weather of some sort. This collection shows off Hill\u2019s ability to write such believable characters (for the most part) and intriguing / non-typical plots Here is my ranking of each story:1. Loaded - Hill\u2019s story about the \u2018hard on\u2019 america has with guns is the best thing I\u2019ve read all year. Such an amazing story, well told with all the tragedy you\u2019d expect. 2. Aloft - Teenager gets stuck on a cloud...not really much else to say as a synopsis. This is definately the most whimsical of the four stories but I felt it was very imaginative. 3. Snapshot - Tough to describe this one without spoiling it all but it\u2019s the scariest story in the bunch set during the polaroid era. Very sinister. 4. Rain - The only one of the four stories that I didn\u2019t enjoy much. It had its ups and downs but I couldn\u2019t get onboard with it for some reason. Razor sharp rain falls from the sky, kills everyone. What makes this one interesting is that when Hill wrote it first time around it featured a time when a female president was in power with a much \u2018happier\u2019 ending. I don\u2019t think Hill likes Trump much. Joe Hill is fast becoming one of my favourite authors and this showcases some of his best writing yet. Kellaway would smash the world to see George danceYou knew what was real not by its qualities but by its imperfections.It was reassuring to know our national leaders were using all the resources at their disposal to help the desperate: social media and Jesus."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15865336-jan", "userReview": "By far the best set of short stories I've read in a long time. I didn't want them to end!Actually, these are more novellas than shorties, which makes a big difference when it comes to allowing for more character development and plot depth. Not that Hill needs any help in this department, as he is the king of creating memorable characters that will stick with you IMO. (The Fireman comes to mind) Once again Hill creates visual worlds where anything can happen: from a camera that steals your memories to a sky that rains needles instead of rain drops.The title 'Strange Weather' is very appropriate, as mother nature makes an appearance in each of the 4 stories and helps to create an atmospheric tension that literally crackles. Pun intended...Loaded is by far the most 'punch you in the face' read, but my absolute favorite was Rain, which was both heartbreaking and funny (sarcastically) all in one.If you haven't read anything by Hill yet, this is a good way to find out what you have been missing!Highly recommend!"}, {"userName": "Panagiotis", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL":

Even the one about Rain. Or maybe I should say, the Rain novella was more than solid: it was hard as diamond. :)In all cases, the characters shine. There are tons of fat comments, 80's memorabilia, and POLAROIDS in \"Snapshot\". The concept behind it was pure horror and quite interesting, but I was on the fence about the wrap-up. I appreciate the whole thing, the human element, and the character growth, but the oomph was kinda drowned out by it.\"Loaded\" was probably my least favorite, but it had its gun-loving charms. It was more a police thriller than anything else, going round and round the danger until his world falls apart for good. Heroes and Villains, indeed.\"Aloft\" was pretty brilliant from the imagination viewpoint and I rather rocked to the whole fear and astonishment and discovery angle. :) This is my second favorite story in the collection.But it was \"Rain\" that just stole the whole damn show. Terrorism and global warning and easily the best complicated and delightful characterization I've seen out of Joe Hill, yet. That's including the Locke and Key series. I loved just about everything in this one, from the horror to the crazy to the wicked. :) That rain is nuts! I love it most. :)It probably doesn't matter if you're a fan of Joe Hill or not if you're looking to this for a good read. Chances are, you might just fall in love with the author just from this. :) It's well worth it and super enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Michael Hicks", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6409681-michael-hicks", "userReview": "Strange Weather, the latest offering from Joe Hill, is four books in one! Collected here are four novellas, united by the theme of weather (sometimes strongly, other times more subtly), with the stories running the gamut of apocalyptic rain to raging wildfires.Hill hits the ground running with Snapshot, an eerie little coming-of-age tale revolving around a supernatural Polaroid camera. I was worried at first that this would be Hill riffing again on his father, Stephen King, who wrote his own supernatural camera story way back when with The Sun Dog, but Hill gets off a good one here and does his own thing. The result is pretty fantastic, with some solid meditations on aging and the fear of our own personal futures. There's a great deal of emotional resonance to this one, and Hill pulled pretty hard on my heartstrings. Not quite a tear-jerker, but it got pretty dang close.Loaded is unapologetically political, and frankly I don't think it would work any other way. This story tackles America's favorite obsession, our one true golden idol - guns, guns, guns! Sensitive readers who decry having politics in their fiction will be clutching their pearls in white-knuckled fists hard enough to make diamonds when they lay their eyes on this one! This here story is a ripped from the headlines of Everywhere, USA horror revolving around racism and gun violence. I have no problem with political stories, and I agree with the majority of what Hill has to say here. What bugged me, though, is that it took a really, really, really long time for this novella to start going places. At first it felt more like a series of short stories united by a common element, as Hill introduces a number of characters over the course of several chapters (one who disappears for a good long while) before showing us how it all comes together. I was a bit frustrated, initially, but once the various threads started coming together, I found this to be a pretty decent work overall, and I now find myself wanting to see Hill play around a bit more in the crime genre.Aloft has some cool character development and relationships, and although the situation Aubrey finds himself in during a parachute jump gone awry is certainly interesting, I just wasn't able to suspend my disbelief deeply enough for this one to gel with me. Even at novella length, it seemed to carry on longer than needed, or at least longer than my interest could stay vested, and I found myself itching to get off this ride way too soon.By the time I was about half-way through Aloft, I was ready to chalk up this book as a loss. What had started out strong was quickly devolving, and I'd gone from a really strong opening, to an OK crime story, to finally just wanting to be done with this thing. And then I hit upon Rain, the final story in this sequence, and holy crap. Hill admits to spoofing himself and his doorstopper of a book, The Fireman, with Rain, and while I enjoyed the former title quite a lot, this one is better. It's shorter, leaner, and our central character goes places. It's nicely apocalyptic and strange, and Hill gets in a few solid pot-shots at Donald Trump (which are both highly appreciated and slightly amusing, but also too f'ing accurate...). So yeah, I dug the heck out of this one.Although the middle portion of the book fatigued me, Strange Weather is ultimately redeemed by its strong opening and an even better finish. If either Snapshot or Rain had been released as solo stories, each would have been an easy five star for me. Taken a whole, though, this is a pretty solid three-star collection for me and I'll be happily adding my signed pre-order to the shelves alongside Hill's other works once it arrives in October.

I was pleasantly surprised with the variety, in this anthology, as each of the four stories contained inside had an entirely different genre, focus and style, which spoke volumes of the prowess of this author.'Snapshot, 1988' had a pure 80's horror vibe, which made this a mildly disturbing yet entirely fun story of a young boy stumbling across a camera that takes far more from this in frame than just their picture... This had the most traditional horror feel to it and provided many instances of withheld breathe and quickly turned pages. 3.5/5 stars.'Loaded' was my favourite in this collection. My original rating was four stars but I have since decided to round it up to the full five, as days after reading it I still can't stop thinking of the horrors of this tale. The focus is on a mall shooting and Hill as woven multiple narratives and perspectives to give a humbling and horrific portrayal of gun crime, racism, and prevalent (and wholly inaccurate) stereotypes. This scathing societal insight was powerful and wrought with high emotion. 5/5 stars'Aloft' is the story of a young man parachuting with a group of friends in memory of one lost from their group. As he descends to earth his journey is far shorter than he imagined and with some surprising consequences. This was the most bizarre tale with a unique focus that had me puzzling over where this story was going to take the reader. Whilst not the ending I had anticipated and with the slightly open-ended nature leaving me furrow-browed, this was my least favourite but still an entertaining read. 3/5 stars'Rain' proposed the possibility of our usual liquid rain being replaced with razor-sharp needles that could fell the population in mere minutes, if shelter were not available. Whether climate change or terrorism is behind this startling new phenomena, the dystopian world that is quickly created in its wake probes at the feeble structures that hold civilisation together, and how quickly it could all crumble. 4.5/5 starsI received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

This is a fantastic collection of 4 novellas from an author that is quickly becoming one of my favorites. Hill's writing is quirky, unflinching, and always surprising. I've found that especially with his shorter pieces, there is a fantastical element of whimsical strangeness that sometimes ends on a happy note, and other times leaves you reeling. And that's one of the things I love so much about Hill. Every story is a surprise, a concept you don't see coming, and an outcome that you can never quite predict.The four novellas in this collection are:Snapshot - 5 StarsLoaded - 3 StarsAloft - 5 StarsRain - 5 StarsHere's the deal. I'm going to try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, since the book hasn't even been released yet. Three of the stories in this collection are fantastic and exactly what I have come to expect from Hill. One of them, however, was a bit of a disappointment for me. It isn't poorly written, as a matter of fact, it's a page turner. However, and this is also a small beef that I have with Sleeping Beauties, I felt that Loaded was a little too \"riled up Hill needs to vent\" and not enough \"reader, come with me and get lost in a horror story\". Horror is my favorite form of escape. And while Loaded is truly terrifying, in that the events of the story closely mirror the current situation in America, I feel like it was written more as a rant by Hill concerning gun control, and less a story that's meant to entertain. It's no secret that Hill and his father, Stephen King, are very politically outspoken, and that has started to deeply affect their writing. Perhaps King has always injected his politics into his fiction, and for some reason I have just never noticed it as much. Truthfully, I read most of King's novels in my teens and early 20's, and it may not have been something that I picked up on. Certainly King and Hill have become more outspoken with the current election of our new Cheeto In Chief, and while I find their acerbic comments hilarious on twitter, I'm looking for horror to escape from our current political mess, and not shove it into my face.That being said, this is another brilliant collection from Joe Hill. I highly recommend Strange Weather, and even thought the book hasn't even been released yet, I'm already looking forward to his next release."}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "Snapshot is the first story and it\u2019s narrated by Will Wheaton who does a most excellent job.Set in the 80\u2019s, Strange Weather is the story of a 13 year old boy and his run in with a man he calls \u201cThe Phoenician\u201d. The Phoenician is the villain of the tale. He\u2019s ugly, vaguely imposing and possesses a camera that steals memories. It\u2019s also a story about aging, and about caring for those who once cared for you. It has some misty eyed moments and just a wee bit of eeriness. It lags pretty badly towards the end though and left me feeling gloomy. Loaded is narrated by Stephen Lang who is deadly serious for a deadly serious story.This dark tale is about guns, hate, prejudice, revenge and the media. I\u2019m going to admit that there are many days that I have to turn off the news because I can\u2019t take in any more of the unending ugliness occurring in the US right now (as I write this there has just been another senseless school shooting that is barely getting any media coverage). This is a story I never would have chosen to spend my free time reading had I known more before going in. I read to escape this true life horror. This story introduces a group of mostly loathsome people who come together in a climax of bloodshed at a shopping mall, taking out a few innocents along the way. In the aftermath, it turns into a story of the stupidity of hero worship and the suspicious reporter who smells something fishy. Though well written, it wasn\u2019t my favorite and I would never read it again.Aloft is narrated by Dennis Boutsikaris and just like the previous two narrators, he nails it. Things go awry for a young man with an extreme fear of heights when he attempts to skydive to fulfill a wish made to a deceased friend and he ends up stranded on a cloud. This story is super imaginative but it also wasn\u2019t my favorite. Something about Aubrey just grated on my last nerve. I don\u2019t know if it was his fearfulness and gaseous emissions in the beginning, his never-ending pining away for a girl who was so not into him or just his personality. At any rate, it was a struggle and it shouldn\u2019t have been. I found his thoughts boring and all we get are his thoughts. Sorry, I\u2019m a jerk. I know this. If you\u2019re going to throw anything my way, make sure it\u2019s a horror book. Rain is the final story and, if you ask me, the best in the collection. It is read by Kate Mulgrew who is one of my most favorite of all the narrators in all of the lands. So many people seem to loath this story and find it ridiculous (and yeah maybe it is that) but I thought it was heartbreaking and sarcastically funny and Honeysuckle was a character I loved spending time with (unlike that Aubrey fellow) which is probably why I enjoyed it so much. She\u2019s tough and resilient as a spiky rain falls from the sky and reigns terrors on those caught up in it.I have to say, with the exception of Rain, I found this collection a wee bit unsatisfying."}, {"userName": "Lata", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata", "userReview": "[though wondered what was the purpose behind creating the main character's girlfriend if the author killed the woman almost immediately after she appears on the page (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jos\u00e9", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35062854-jos", "userReview": "Pod\u00e9s encontrar esta y otras rese\u00f1as en mi blog.\nStrange Weather es la primera colecci\u00f3n de novelas cortas de Joe Hill. El autor escribi\u00f3 estas historias en diferentes etapas de su carrera y decidi\u00f3 publicarlas todas juntas en un solo volumen. Si bien son novelas independientes y autoconclusivas, todas tienen algo en com\u00fan: fen\u00f3menos clim\u00e1ticos extra\u00f1os que inciden en la trama. A pesar de que est\u00e1n catalogadas como novelas de terror, las historias de Strange Weather tienen cierto contenido fant\u00e1stico y sobrenatural (con la \u00fanica excepci\u00f3n de Loaded). Cada novela es presentada con ilustraciones de diferentes artistas; entre ellos se destaca Gabriel Rodriguez, un artista que colabor\u00f3 con Joe Hill en la maravillosa serie de novelas gr\u00e1ficas de Locke & Key.A continuaci\u00f3n hago una breve rese\u00f1a de cada novela corta con su respectiva calificaci\u00f3n. Como siempre, estas rese\u00f1as no tienen spoilers:Snapshot (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)La primera novela de esta colecci\u00f3n es narrada por un hombre que recuerda un hecho siniestro de su adolescencia: su encuentro con \"el Hombre de la Polaroid\". El narrador se encuentra con una anciana que lo cuidaba cuando era ni\u00f1o y nota que la pobre parece tener demencia senil. Sin embargo, durante un breve lapso de lucidez, la anciana le advierte al joven que se cuide del hombre de la Polaroid y que no deje que empiece a robarle sus recuerdos. Se trata de una historia narrada \"a lo King\", con un personaje que relata su infancia y la vida en un peque\u00f1o pueblo, pero que adem\u00e1s introduce lo sobrenatural y lo siniestro en la vida cotidiana. En mi opini\u00f3n la genialidad de esta novela no est\u00e1 en la premisa (estoy seguro de haber le\u00eddo algo parecido antes), sino en la forma en la que Joe Hill le da vida a los personajes. Adoro las historias en las que uno siente que el narrador est\u00e1 contando una an\u00e9cdota real y Snapshot entra en esa categor\u00eda. Loaded (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605)La segunda novela est\u00e1 escrita en un formato distinto: los cap\u00edtulos son diferentes horas de los d\u00edas en los que transcurre la acci\u00f3n. Al principio, este cambio en el formato hizo que me resultara dif\u00edcil de seguir la trama porque se nos presentan diferentes personajes que al parecer no tienen nada que ver uno con el otro. Por un lado tenemos a una reportera afroamericana cuyo primo fue asesinado por la polic\u00eda cuando era adolescente; luego tenemos a un encargado de una joyer\u00eda que enga\u00f1a a su mujer con una joven empleada y por \u00faltimo nos encontramos con un ex militar propenso a la violencia que trabaja como guardia de seguridad en un centro comercial. La raz\u00f3n por la cual esta me parece la mejor historia de esta colecci\u00f3n es porque no recurre a elementos paranormales para horrorizar al lector; es una novela que trata temas de actualidad como la brutalidad polic\u00edaca, el racismo y la violencia dom\u00e9stica. En mi opini\u00f3n esta es la historia en la cual Joe Hill se luce por la forma en que va conectando las tramas de los diferentes personajes hasta llegar a un final inesperado; la forma en la que va incrementando la tensi\u00f3n es magistral y deja al lector sin palabras.Aloft (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606)La tercera novela rompe con el tono siniestro de las dos anteriores al ofrecer una historia de superaci\u00f3n personal... quiz\u00e1s por esta raz\u00f3n me parece la m\u00e1s floja de la colecci\u00f3n. Aloft es protagonizada por Aubrey, un joven muy inseguro que est\u00e1 a punto de lanzarse por primera vez en paraca\u00eddas y, para decirlo de forma clara, est\u00e1 cagado de miedo porque teme a las alturas. La raz\u00f3n por la cual se va a lanzar en paraca\u00eddas es que una de sus mejores amigas falleci\u00f3 y todos prometieron lanzarse en paraca\u00eddas en su honor. Sin embargo, Aubrey en realidad est\u00e1 en el avi\u00f3n para impresionar a la joven de la cual est\u00e1 perdidamente enamorado. El salto en paraca\u00eddas termina siendo un desastre debido a la presencia de una misteriosa nube con forma de OVNI que provoca una falla en los motores del avi\u00f3n. Aubrey se lanza sin pensarlo y tanto \u00e9l c\u00f3mo su instructor aterrizan sobre la nube. La nube parece ser un organismo vivo que materializa todos los deseos de Aubrey, solo que el joven sabe que lo que est\u00e1 viendo no es real y tendr\u00e1 que buscar la forma de volver a tierra. Como mencion\u00e9 en el primer p\u00e1rrafo de esta breve rese\u00f1a, el tono de esta novela es completamente diferente al de las dos anteriores. Los cap\u00edtulos saltan entre el presente de Aubrey y su pasado, lo cual proporciona al lector una mejor comprensi\u00f3n del personaje y las razones de sus inseguridades. Es una historia acerca de enfrentar los miedos y luchar por una mejor vida, aunque esto suponga dejar atr\u00e1s a los seres queridos. No me pareci\u00f3 una mala novela, pero me dio la sensaci\u00f3n de que est\u00e1 fuera de lugar en la colecci\u00f3n y por momentos Aubrey resulta un poco llor\u00f3n de m\u00e1s. Rain (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606)Joe Hill finaliza esta gran colecci\u00f3n con una historia sobre el fin del mundo. Rain es protagonizada por una joven lesbiana llamada Honeysuckle que contempla c\u00f3mo una horrenda lluvia de rel\u00e1mpagos cristalizados asesina a todos sus vecinos. A medida que la historia avanza, conocemos las razones detr\u00e1s de este extra\u00f1o fen\u00f3meno clim\u00e1tico y c\u00f3mo la sociedad comienza a desmoronarse. Esta es otra historia bastante brutal y aterradora por la forma en que el autor transmite la desesperaci\u00f3n de la protagonista. Honeysuckle observa con impotencia c\u00f3mo todo su mundo queda destruido por un fen\u00f3meno inexplicable y sin sentido. La \u00fanica raz\u00f3n por la cual no es la mejor historia de la colecci\u00f3n es porque Loaded es demasiado buena y porque se vuelve un poco predecible. Sin embargo, es una novela de r\u00e1pida lectura y con un final excelente que no deja ning\u00fan cabo suelto, cosa que no suele ocurrir en la mayor\u00eda de las historias sobre el fin del mundo. En definitiva, Strange Weather es una excelente colecci\u00f3n de novelas cortas que mezclan el terror sobrenatural con la vida cotidiana. Joe Hill se luce en cada historia al plantear diferentes estilos narrativos e ideas muy interesantes. Es un autor que no me voy a cansar de recomendar a todo el mundo."}, {"userName": "Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72102510-crystal", "userReview": "and the last storyRain: A warped look at human nature under extraordinary circumstances story 1, 5 starsstory 2, 4 stars story 3, 2 starsstory 4, 5 starsI guess you could say all the stories were really human nature related, and nature-nature relatedWhat will a person do when their entire world and all they believe, even the weather, is shook?Many different perspectives from various scenarios."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna", "userReview": "The light was silver and gray, and so was the mood. The temperature hovered a little below lonesome.I\u2019ll face whatever blows in on the wind. It may come to blow gales of pure sadness instead of air and leave us all taking shelter from grief. Maybe time itself will crest and drop instead of temperature.There is some beautiful writing scattered in this book which contains four novellas of around 100 pages each that are very loosely connected by unnatural phenomena to do with the weather. But these novellas are also connected by something less than beautiful, which I\u2019ll get to later on. For now, here\u2019s a rundown of the stories and my impressions of them. First up was \u201cSnapshot,\u201d a creepy coming of age story with the most depth of all the novellas in this collection. It was written in a style I\u2019ll call \u201cStephen King lite,\u201d which isn\u2019t a criticism or even surprising, considering the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. As a matter of fact, I\u2019d love to do a blind taste test sometime between Hill and his dad\u2019s work to see if I could tell the difference between them. In this story, I couldn\u2019t. Michael Figlione, 13, has discovered an evil man has invaded his town armed with a camera that captures more than the moment. And worst of all, the man\u2019s latest subject is someone dear to Michael who may soon be lost to him if he doesn\u2019t act now. This story was a mostly satisfying one with Michael, a loner without friends who\u2019s overweight and bullied, going on a mission that will require him to find inner strength he has never called upon before. In doing so, he must find a way to accelerate the process of maturing to battle against evil and to do the right thing. This is easier said than done. Maturity is not something that happens all at once. It is not a border between two countries where once you cross the invisible line, you are on the new soil of adulthood, speaking the foreign tongue of grownups. It is more like a distant broadcast, and you are driving toward it, and sometimes you can barely make it out through the hiss of static while other times the reception momentarily clears and you can pick up the signal with perfect clarity.Four stars for the story\u2019s depth and emotional tug, and for it having the best writing of the collection. It\u2019s missing an extra star for an elongated ending that I thought would never end. It pretty much ruined what could have been a much more climactic ending to the story. Also, I was hoping the creep out factor would have been higher, considering the subject matter and considering I read this for Halloween. The second story was \u201cLoaded,\u201d which was the worst story in the collection. It was about a security guard at a shopping mall with a troubled past and more trouble on the way as he tries to stop a shooter and only adds to the problem at hand. This story was a cheap one, glorifying the use of firearms and violence, and ending on an ironic note that was another cheap shot, making a joke out of something all too real and all too serious in today\u2019s world\u2014massacres in public places. For shame, Mr. Hill. And definitely not a funny ending. Not one bit. One star. The third story was \u201cAloft,\u201d my second favorite for its sheer inventiveness. A man goes skydiving for the first time, against his will, and lands in trouble when landing not on the ground, but on a cloud that\u2019s no ordinary cloud. This story was both whimsical and terrifying, though not frightening by far, unless you happened to be that unfortunate man. 3.5 Stars. The last story was \u201cRain,\u201d which featured another cloud that brought something far worse than acid rain. Another high body count in this story, but less gratuitous violence than in \u201cLoaded\u201d and with an interesting post apocalyptic bend to it with shimmers of hope. 3 Stars. So basically, if you\u2019re looking for something frightening, such as what Hill writes in his full length novels, you might find this book lacking unless you adjust your expectations from the start. For me, this was a hit and miss collection, one that was interesting and inventive at times, but nothing I would have been sorry to miss out on if I hadn\u2019t read it. And now, concerning the less than beautiful thing I mentioned earlier\u2014there was a trend in this book I found disturbing. Not one, not two, not three, but four out of the four stories in this collection featured characters disparaged for being overweight. I\u2019m well aware this happens in real life, and it happening in \u201cSnapshot\u201d was actually a legitimate part of that story with the MC being overweight and there being an exploration of his feelings and there being more to his character than his waist size. But in the three stories that followed, the overweight characters were mostly minor ones who were defined as being fat and little else other than any number of negative traits to go with it. And there was no reason for doing this that I could see. Those characters could just as well have been defined as being skinny or pasty-faced or slouchy or bedraggled or nerdy in appearance\u2014anything but \u201cfat\u201d again. Why the author chose to repeat this trait again and again in a negative way, or perhaps just ran out of adjectives to be disdainful toward certain characters, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m calling him on it to bring awareness of what he\u2019s doing. As shown by the quotes at the beginning, Hill can certainly write something beautiful and more worthy of his talent. I can only hope so next time."}], "description": "A collection of four chilling novels, ingeniously wrought gems of terror from the brilliantly imaginative, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Fireman, Joe Hill.\"One of America\u2019s finest horror writers\" (Time magazine), Joe Hill has been hailed among legendary talents such as Peter Straub, Neil Gaiman, and Jonathan Lethem.
