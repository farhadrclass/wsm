As those who know me and my predilection for mysteries set in either historical or modern Chicago will surmise, I read this because the bulk of the \u201cdeductin\u2019\u201d takes place at the 1893 Columbian Exposition (aka Chicago World\u2019s Fair, aka White City). The conceit of this series is that a cowboy sleuth and admirer of Sherlock Holmes has had and, in the course of the narration, is having his investigations chronicles in dime novel form by his brother. In this adventure, several publishers have gotten together after the disappearance of an allegedly historical Mr. Holmes and the expose that one Nick Carter was merely a fictional character. The purpose of this amalgamation of garrulous and publicity-conscious detectives, straight from the pages of their dime novels and pulp magazines, is to determine the appropriate successor to the sobriquet \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Sleuth\u201d as formerly appended to the presumed late Mr. Holmes. The plan is to plant a golden egg somewhere within the fairgrounds and force the would-be detectives to deduce its location via some riddles and puns. As one detective protests that solving riddles is not a true test of one\u2019s ability to investigate, there naturally occurs (or perhaps, more accurately, unnaturally) an opportunity to prosecute a real investigation.Unfortunately, one William Pinkerton (head of the famous agency and successor to the famous Allan Pinkerton who founded the detective agency) proves unwilling to be upstaged by those he deems as amateurs at best and frauds at worst. So, Pinkerton uses his connections with Chicago\u2019s Finest to keep the protagonists and their associates off the case. Of course, most mysteries offer the trope of detectives being warned off the case, so that\u2019s nothing new. It wouldn\u2019t be a spoiler to say that our \u201cHolmes on the Range\u201d stays on the case. Of course, even as the clich\u00e9 of \u201ccherchez la femme\u201d applies to many mysteries, the clue for World\u2019s Greatest Sleuth would have to be \u201ccherchez la motif.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until the two brothers (and their colleagues) began to understand the potential for larceny within the contest that they were able to zero in on the suspected murderer. Until then, the reader is regaled with humor at the expense of the rural cowboys, misdirection, an amazing assortment of real and false beards, and a rather humiliating discovery by the narrator that comes across with considerable amusement.Personally, I didn\u2019t feel that the author offered sufficient groundwork for his final revelation. I don\u2019t think there were unfair clues, I just didn\u2019t feel there were enough pointers. Even when we\u2019re fooled by the perpetrators, most of us like to be able to think back over the story and remember the groundwork that we might have overlooked in our hurry to chase a \u201cred herring\u201d or when we were distracted by some more immediate threat to the main characters. In this case, nothing particularly comes to mind. As a result, I can say that I\u2019m glad I read this book, but I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to read another in this series."}, {"userName": "Spuddie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/348527-spuddie", "userReview": "Another excellent entry in this series featuring the Amlingmeyer brothers, Big Red (Otto) and Old Red (Gustav) as they are off to Chicago to the World's Fair of 1893 to participate in a contest to determine (you guessed it!) the World's Greatest Sleuth. This is not something they volunteered for--Otto's publisher enrolled them to get publicity for his series of books and Old Red, still recovering from an incident that left him blinded for weeks, is NOT happy.Arriving at the last minute, they aren't sure exactly how the contest works, and they find themselves up against some awfully strange characters, the only friendly face being their old friend Diana Corvus. Both the brothers are hoping to impress her, but it's not exactly turning out that way...and when the man who was writing the contest clues ends up dead--smothered in a Mammoth Cheese--there are actually two contests going on...the sanctioned one, and the unofficial one to find who killed him. Hilarious and full of wry humor as well as some wonderful information and detail about the Chicago World's Fair, this was a great story and a well-plotted mystery with a bad guy that I didn't figure out nearly til the end.

The main characters tend to run together into my mind into one big blur, until I can't keep straight which main sleuth goes with what series. And, I sometimes even find myself reading an entire chapter of a series before realizing, hey, I've read THIS book before. Sometimes I actually have read the book, and sometimes the book is just more or less the same as another few dozen I've read before. Hockensmith, however, really has managed to take a totally original view of the traditional mystery, and create some deep, interesting characters in a fast paced read with some laugh out loud moments. I love this series, and I hope he writes more. This particular installment isn't particularly deep and meaty, and the plot might wear thin in areas, but because of the sheer originality, the entertaining writing, and the characters I've come to enjoy, I read straight through to the end in a single afternoon. I hope he writes a dozen more."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2134607-debbie", "userReview": "Currently the last in this amusing series, but hopefully not forever! In this entry it is nice to see Old Red loosen up a bit and begin to get some credit. Underlying the mystery plot and the humor, what really makes this series worthwhile is the true affection between the brothers and the frustration and poignancy of the Amlingmeyers being thwarted by their lack of polish, the assumption that they must be backwards cowboys who don't know anything, and the belief that, in the case of Old Red, an inability to read must mean that he is stupid."}, {"userName": "Tim Hicks", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111076-tim-hicks", "userReview": "[ a certain Norwegian explorer (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Roger", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5672633-roger", "userReview": "Ugh. Where to begin? The Amlingmeyer brothers (they are cowboys) are great admirers of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, so they have that going for them. And in the first book in this series, Holmes on the Range, they prove themselves adept enough operators. With the second book things went straight to hell, and nor are we out of it. World's Greatest Sleuth! (the fifth book) is set during the 1893 World's Fair, and reads like an atrocious episode of The Beverly Hillbillies. Whatever charms the first book had to offer are diminished at this point to non-existence. Hopefully that is what has happened to this series as well. \"Deducifying\" is not a word. Cornpone probably isn't either, but that colloquialism is still an accurate description. There is a scene here that should have been the zenith of the series-it is telegraphed almost from the beginning. Instead it is the nadir. Any measure of poignancy one might have felt has been pummeled out of the reader but what has gone before.

I threw in an extra star because it was easy to read and the mystery was well-plotted. Otherwise, it was disappointing. Old Red is one of the dullest characters I\u2019ve ever read about, his tedious banality only emphasized by how annoying his younger brother (the narrator) is. In my opinion, a mystery is only as good as the ones trying to solve it, and the Amlingmeyer brothers leave much to be desired. The humor/dialogue was lame, and holy moly, the story was sooo melodramatic, especially at the end. And apparently, Old Red is supposed to be the \u2018Sherlock Holmes\u2019 of the \u2018range\u2019, which (ha!) was the funniest part of the whole book!

Sherlock Holmes was never as much fun as Old Red and Big Red when it comes to \"deducifyin\"!The combination of the wild-West cowboy brothers - who are known as the \"Holmes on the Range\" - and who are fish-out-of-water in the setting of the 1893 White City of the Chicago World's Fair, with a cast of other colourful characters, all of whom start out participating in a publicity stunt scavenger hunt to solve clues and find hidden eggs, quickly turns into a competition to solve the murder of the puzzle-master, who ends up dead, face-down and suffocated in the world's biggest cheese [from Canada, just for local colour!] is just one big hilarious adventure.The writer's style [which is presented as being written by one of the crime-solving Reds - who, as luck would have it, happens to be a mystery writer a-la-Dr. Watson and is chronicling this adventure for his next book] is a bit unusual, but so much fun, and is full of clever and sarcastic asides with snarks at the other sleuths, the contest organizers, and even his own brother and himself as well as telling the story. I laughed out loud all through the book.The characters are all extremely well-written, with unique and interesting voices and personalities and they all add even more entertainment to the story. I liked them all and felt they rounded out our cast of misfits very well, adding to the mystery and the possible suspects, who were also the sleuths.I should note that I did not realize when I started this book that it is #5 in a series. Although I did not feel like I was lost at all in reading this installment out of order - the author does a great job of giving enough detail and history about the Reds to allow you to enjoy the story even without knowing the previous history of Big Red and Old Red, there were small references to what must be their earlier crime-solving experiences and there are obviously some connections with one of the other characters in this book from the past. So while it was absolutely possible to enjoy this book without reading the earlier ones, if I'd known this was #5, I probably would have started with the first book - Holmes on the Range - first. And now that I know how wonderful these characters are, I will DEFINTELY be going back to the first book and reading the others.As far as the mystery goes, I'm not good to offer an opinion on how challenging the mystery was, and whether the murder presented sufficient challenge for those who like to try to figure out whodunnit before the killer is revealed. It seemed well-conceived to me, but I don't even try to out-detect the detectives, so I don't know. I do know this was a great read!This was such a funny, clever unusual and highly entertaining sort of murder mystery - I loved every page of it! I can't wait to go on more deducifyin' adventures with the Amlingmeyer brothers. Highly recommended for readers of murder mysteries, and those who enjoy the turn-of-the-century period in the U.S. or cowboys.

World\u2019s Greatest Sleuth! finds Sherlock Holmes disciple Gustav (\u201cSome folks get religion. Gustav got Sherlock Holmes.\u201d) and Watson-esque brother Otto summoned to Chicago to participate in a mystery solving competition at the 1893 Columbian Exposition (aka Chicago World\u2019s Fair).Upon arrival, the brothers find themselves up against famous crime solvers from around the world, including frenemies Col. Crowe and Diana Corvus (On the Wrong Track and The Black Dove). The competitors are challenged with solving a set of clues each day, with the winner of the most daily competitions at the end of the contest being crowned the \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Sleuth.\u201dThings take a serious turn, however, when the competition\u2019s organizer is found dead on the second day of the competition..face down in a giant vat of cheese (The Mammoth Cheese From Canada \u2013 Weight 22,000 Pounds). Though the local police seem inclined to write it off as an accidental death, Gustav and Otto think there\u2019s more to it than meets the eye and, as Holmes would say, the game is afoot to find the killer.The Chicago World\u2019s Fair is a unique setting \u2013 and a marvelous one for a murder mystery \u2013 but is one with which many readers many not be familiar. Have no fear. Author Steve Hockensmith does a fantastic job making the Fair and its famed \u201cWhite City\u201d come to life, and his wonderfully vivid descriptions make the reader feel as if he were actually there at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair along with Otto and Gustav. Hockensmith is also very adept at blending setting and story with just the right amount of humor, all of which makes following the adventures of the Amlingmeyer brothers pretty much irresistible.If you like mysteries (especially of the Sherlock Holmes variety), westerns, or homicide with a side of humor then you need to pick up a copy of World\u2019s Greatest Sleuth! and get to deducifyin\u2019 and detectin\u2019 along with Otto and Gustav, two of the most colorful and engaging amateur sleuths you\u2019ll ever encounter."}, {"userName": "Summer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46848979-summer", "userReview": "[ either resent how they themselves have been portrayed in the books, or bring up private things they know about the brothers now, or are trying to change the brothers in order to make the books more marketable  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Cathy Cole", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5086649-cathy-cole", "userReview": "I've been holding on to the World's Greatest Sleuth like it's gold. This is a volume from one of my \"Reliables\"-- a mystery series so good that I keep myself from reading through it as fast as I can go. I didn't want to read it and be forced to admit that the series was at an end. But I recently learned from the author that there will be new Holmes on the Range mysteries coming in the future, and this allowed me to enjoy watching the Amlingmeyer brothers in action once more. Hockensmith gives us a good look at the World's Columbian Exposition through the eyes of Big Red and his curmudgeon of a brother. Through them, we see the \"White City\" in all its majesty and absurdity-- and usually at a gallop (or at least a fast run). There are lots of laughs at the Amlingmeyers' expense, but they're used to it, and when readers pause to inhale so they can laugh again, they just might notice that Hockensmith has written a first-rate mystery, too. That World's Greatest Sleuth competition is an interesting one with the death of its biggest detractor (a bred-to-the-bone Sherlockian purist) at its heart. Something tells me that the author has probably had more than one encounter with those pesky Sherlockian purists since he began writing this series.If you're not too much of a purist and can accept the presence of an illiterate cowboy as an Old West Sherlock Holmes, you are going to love this book (and the series). Hockensmith has a smooth writing style that knows how to tell a strong tale, make readers laugh, and give them a true feel for the wild, wild West-- all at the same time.

Luckily, I've found that the characters and the setting entrance me as much as the mystery.In this installment, we have our two intrepid sleuths heading to the 1893 Chicago Exposition to compete to be named World's Greatest Sleuth in the wake of Sherlock Holmes death. Once there, they discover that the game is simply solving riddles to find an egg hidden on the fairgrounds every day. That is, until the game's organizer is found dead when the real mystery begins.Diana Crow (Corvus) rejoins us from On The Wrong Track - she and the Colonel are also competing in the competition.This book is once again a hilarious tale of deducifying narrated by someone who seems to truly understand the characters.

In four previous novels, they have had to work very hard through some very bad luck in order to stay alive while attempting to solve a mystery.

This being the second book I've read in the Holmes on the Range series, and the fifth in the series, I was prepared for what to expect from the book. It certainly met expectations: a light-hearted rendering of a murder mystery with the taciturn Old Red and self-effacing Big Red, references to Sherlock Holmes (in various ways) and actual historical figures of the day. The plot provided a unique angle and the setting a more unusual one for a \"western Holmesian mystery.\" (My description, not the author's or publisher's.)It is entertaining and a quick read, and given its setting rated 4 stars from me.

The mystery and sub-plots are interesting, and the solution was unexpected.The context of the previous books and the easy disdain the brothers encounter made the climax (and the much hoped-for cameo appearance at the very end) emotionally touching.

This is written to be humorous, and I do enjoy the Brothers badinage but I couldn't get wholly behind this entry in the series.I do strongly recommend starting w/ the first in the series to fully enjoy the books."}, {"userName": "Mark Baker", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4545420-mark-baker", "userReview": "Cowboys Old Red and Big Red are summoned to the World's Fair in Chicago to compete in a competition to discover who is the best detective in the world now that Sherlock Holmes has vanished.

I always enjoy spending time around these brothers in the 1890's, and this book was no exception. The story is strong as are the characters. Another fun read.Read my full review at Carstairs Considers."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12049103-ann", "userReview": "In 1893 the Amlingmeyer brothers, Gustav \"Old Red\" and Otto \"Big Red\", travel to the Chicago Exposition in order to participate in a detecting contest, lead by internationally renowned detective William Pinkerton to determine who the world's greatest sleuth. The contest turns weird when someone shoves the contest organizer, Armstrong Curtis, into a vat of cheese. This book moves right along in a quirky, disjointed manner. The brothers are very funny and homey and the other characters are diverse and strange. The setting is great and the book is enjoyable throughout.

Too good maybe. Please don't tell me that this is the last book in the series.In this book the Amlingmeyer brothers travel to Chicago to compete in the \"World's Greatest Sleuth\" contest.

That being said, this was pretty good. Hockensmith\u2019s confidence is definitely beginning to show. He has begun playing around with adding more and more humor to these novels. Big Red Amblingmeyer is the perfect foil as sidekick and \"author\" of this series. This novel takes place at the Chicago\u2019s worlds fair in 1893 and boy did the author do his homework. Our intrepid detectives discover juicy fruit gum, ferris wheels and hula dancers all of which were firsts at the fair.
