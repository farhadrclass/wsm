This book was obviously written by a man from page one.Seriously though, the world around you is ending, and the main character is thinking of where he is getting his next piece of tail. Which I can actually see in the case of men, but women really? I don't think three days into the apocalypse we're gonna be feeling frisky. Realistically, I don't see a week into the apocalypse, looking at some chick I barely know, and saying \"Hey wanna come bang the guy I barely know with me?\". They alpha male quality of this book completely drove me crazy! That being said, as crazy as it drove me, it was also ridiculously entertaining. I did enjoy reading it, even as I was imagining punching most of the female characters in their overactive vag. Jay was an interesting character. He used his head in most situation, both the north and the south one. I look forward to any sequels!"}, {"userName": "Stephanie Lunsford", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14783992-stephanie-lunsford", "userReview": "So okay this book is pretty amazing actually! I didn't know how I would feel about a zombie book w/a lead male character that is a chauvinistic pig but turns out that well he is pretty amazing guy after all! He is Jay, father of 3 beautiful children that was a Marine Sniper & loves his country & his friends & family! I love the fact that Jay sees the people of his colony as his family & will die to protect the women & children. you can see the love through his writing when the men would die to save their wives & kids! okay so the 3 main female characters are pretty awesome themselves- you have Cara is his lil Mexican fireball of a woman she is the one that took charge of the \"sisters\" *aka girlfriends* & took control in situations where the kids were in harms way! there are lots of sad parts in the book though! =-(Corp. Corey Rider- AKA LSS & she is the tech specialist that is shy & reserved also a Marine ... well her thing apparently is she likes to be dominated in the bedroom lol & had never been w/a man before the \"Commander\" & then there is Jean- model/teacher that has 2 children that she loves dearly & she's a great shot w/a gun too! She is Jay's neighbors' daughter. oh & WOW the ending of the book! GEEZ! all I will say! it's sad, happy, & wanting to throw the tablet against the wall! omg"}, {"userName": "David P Forsyth", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7201946-david-p-forsyth", "userReview": "Blood, Brains and Bullets is an engaging hybrid of apocalyptic and erotic fiction. Not for the faint of heart, or those easily offended by graphic sexual content, this story packs more than your typical punch. In a world overrun with zombies, the majority of survivors are women and children. This places our protagonist, a single father and former USMC sniper, in the somewhat enviable position of stud and guardian for those who seek his protection. The hero appears to be a bit larger than life (in more than one way!). However, that seems to be the intent of the story. If you like your heroes to be slightly superhuman, sexist, and horny as hell, I think you will enjoy this book."}, {"userName": "Colin Buckland", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18528125-colin-buckland", "userReview": "I got this book after reading a review by another author, David P Forsyth, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It starts off as your run of the mill zompoc story, ex USMC guy, Jay, saving people left right and centre, then suddenly bang, quite literally, we find it's not just a big gun he's packing.This is a man who knows how to keep a lady happy, which he does time and again, but whilst he has a tender side he's also a leader of men and someone you do not want to get on the wrong side of, especially if there is a threat to his or anyone else's children or his ever growing family of refugees, be you man or zombie be assured you will die. The action when it happens is fast, furious and bloody and as I previously mentioned not always against the walking dead, oh and throw in the mysterious Shadow Government who maybe responsible for the zombie outbreak and everything's laid out for an exciting story. The finish leaves it wide open for a follow on, or two perhaps? I know one thing though, if there are any more books, I for one will be reading them."}, {"userName": "Chad Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7400145-chad-johnson", "userReview": "This book is the beginning of a great new series in the world of zombies.

Throughout the story we\u2019ll be following Jay, an ex-marine turned prepper and chauvinistic pig that is apparently also God\u2019s gift to women. Yes while all zombies include violence this one is going to need an extra warning label from it\u2019s sexual charged atmosphere. We\u2019ll get to that last part in a minute though over and over again. I\u2019m actually kind of surprised it wasn\u2019t named \u2018Blood, Brains, and Boobs\u2019! The story begins with Jay having an average day around town when things start going wrong.The zombie apocalypse starts to occur and Jay is actually one of the few people prepared for the world to end. He\u2019s got plans for keeping his family and friends safe and these plans have long term implications. His first step is to of course secure his children (he has 3). He doesn\u2019t want to live alone though and isn\u2019t the type of person to ignore others so goes on a mission to save neighbors and friends. Right after that though is to save a couple highly attractive women he knows about.Speaking of attractive women there are four female leads though we\u2019ll only focus on the three who survive: Cara \u2013 the hot little Mexican firecracker, Corey Rider \u2013 the ex-lesbian tech specialist who hides her looks turned submissive lover, and Jean \u2013 the neighbor\u2019s daughter. Yes, it\u2019s the end of the world so sharing is caring and he get\u2019s shared between the lot of them quite often. As he slowly saves more and more people it starts turning into his own little Utopia. His own grounds are not enough to sustain them all so they start to spread throughout the town. Securing houses, killing off undead, and generally making things a better world. All good things must come to an end though and we have a few big problems on the horizon.You know, problems aside from being surrounded by swarms of the undead.There\u2019s a slightly insane religious group involved in the mix, a group of survivors who want Jay\u2019s resources as their own, and the people who are actually behind the outbreak which have taken over what is left of the military and the world. Give the military some credit though as pockets of them are resisting the people who have brought the world to it\u2019s knees and end up joining Jay\u2019s group (again with him in charge) in order to save the world.The book leaves off with a lot of questions and it would be remiss to leave out that there are some editing and grammatical issues. Even with those it\u2019s such an easy and fun read you\u2019ll be able to skip past them pretty quickly. What you won\u2019t be skipping past is the multitude of sex scenes with Jay and his women as they seem to crop up every 5 pages. Jay is clearly a better man than I as that much sex would wear a man down alone let alone fighting zombies, running that large of a group of people, taking care of your kids, oh and trying to eat and sleep as well.It\u2019s a fun read that you won\u2019t be disappointed in and I highly suggest picking it up!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21488230-rebecca", "userReview": "I honestly thought reading the lowdown on this book that it was going to be great. I was sadly mistaken.Don't get me wrong, this had an amazing amount of potential but was executed poorly.I love a good zombie book and also erotica. But at the same time, I like it realistic.A few days after the zombies started taking over, not only has Jay made a compound for survivors but has a harem of ladies?...These women have just lost everything a day to a week ago and they are just jumping at the opportunity to jump into bed with a man who is waaaaayyyyyy to cocky but also with other women? Not realistic at all.The story started out ok but got worse and worse. I honestly was appalled at the way Jay treated women. Slapping asses of girls he didn't know, yahooing about how his cock is 8 inches. I mean really? All he while he has 3 kids to care for? Pretty sure they'd be having nightmares about what they had witnessed and wanting to sleep with 'daddy'. But no, he's too busy getting his dick wet.Why oh why Jay was such a wanker is beyond me. My view is he should be wanking instead of rooting. Imagine a few books time when all these women are giving birth and the kids grow up. They'd all be complete horn bags too busy getting busy instead of watching out for zombies. Maybe they find a way to tie up a zombie and fuck it's non existent brain out? Sounds like something the author would write.This review may seem harsh but this is how I feel. Don't get me wrong, I love a good dicking as much as the next lady but I can guarantee that after watching my partner die so I could survive or knowing my whole family was eaten alive, I would not be horny at all. Depressed and suicidal, probably but not horny.This is much more a book aimed at men than women which is a shame. Perhaps the author could do another but tone down the male chauvinistic pig ness and make it a more realistic book? I would definitely read and love it too."}, {"userName": "Reader's Hollow", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37382559-reader-s-hollow", "userReview": "When it comes to horror, this book has it in spades. There's gore, blood, gun-power and zombies. I like to learn something new with horror as it's my favorite genre and this book had a few tid-bits that had me Googling and researching on my own. Needless to say, the author hit a few nails on the head when it came to this genre.I often adhere to main characters. I like to know their quirks, their thoughts and their flaws. I can usually like them. For Jay, I...well, he has a pretty big flaw that was hard to see past. It wasn't that he wasn't developed and it wasn't that he was contradicting. It was because he was a middle-aged leacher who stood on a pedestal. He took a group of survivors and led them to safety. He protects children anyway he can and helped create a community devoted to long-term survival.The writing was good. Sean Liebling didn't waste a single word. I'd consider this popcorn fiction or maybe even venture to say that it is erotica for men. The other characters were well developed but the antagonist wasn't present as much as I'd hoped. Yeah, yeah, there's zombies but I mean beyond the zombies. Sometimes the antagonist is briefly given a few paragraphs or is shifted to a different, unassociated character. This is where I felt the story strayed. The primary focus it seemed, to me, was Jay attracting his harem of big breasted, beautiful women. Therefore I'm quite certain I'm not the target audience, haha. I would recommend this to a heterosexual man as there's plenty of blood, action and boobage."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3638128-mary", "userReview": "I liked the book a lot. It is a none traditional book and the author wasn't afraid to push boundaries. He put sex in his book, yes I said sex. This book is one of the most believable zombie stories out there and was well researched. After reading both his book and his website. I found that his book is very possible. That there would be a shortage of men and the men that were left would like pair up with more than one woman. It's happened before in history.The main character Jay, has his own taste in woman. He like large breasted very well shaped woman... But don't we all have our own likes in a mate or in this book mates. Jay is a take charge type (Alpha), but he surrounded by highly capable people that are willing and able to help him in the new roll, that he partly takes on himself and also forced on him by circumstance. He is not afraid to make the hard decisions. To some he may seem overly cocky and immature, circumstances in this story forces him to grow up. And as I read I saw him do this. Yes there are editing issues here and there, but the book is going through a professional editor and new addition should be ready very soon. I commend Sean on admitting there were flaws in the book and is take all necessary steps to make the book better. Sean Liebling does answer all e-mail and comment and I have found him to be very smart, funny and very approachable.So would I recommend this book, yes I would."}, {"userName": "Russell Wilcox", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8550758-russell-wilcox", "userReview": "I am still not sure how much I liked the book. I am also not sure if I will pick up the 2nd book in the series. That is how conflicted I am, and why I rated it a 3. While I read it, I didn't really like it but I just had a hard time putting it down. Most of the problems I had with the book was the main character was barely likable and seamed more action hero than I want in my zombie apocalypse books. At the same time, I loved the focus and detail on the community management part of the story, and what it would take it to survive. He also did a wonderful job of keeping me on my toes. Still, as smart as the zombies are in this world I totally expected more of them by the end of the book. As I said earlier, I am not sure if I will pick up the next book. But if I do, it will be because of the community aspect of the book, and the desire to know what happens next to everyone."}, {"userName": "Arthur", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6559117-arthur", "userReview": "If S M Stirling collaborated with Brooks on a Zombie novel they would have a tough time matching this excellent story. I am not a critic of zombie tales as they are a secret passion and even if I was there would not be anything here to criticize.Most often the common complaint about these books are poor editing and Sean has availed himself of the excellent services of stellar editor.So far 2 books in the series and both take you for a ride in a world infected by vicious predator species climbing and evolving its way up the food chain.If you love zombies you shouldn't miss the chance to get this point of view written by Sean Liebling."}, {"userName": "Norma", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4498326-norma", "userReview": "Blood, Brains and BulletsThis was a great book, I pick it because I hope there's good people out there.I also believe it could happen.
