But it still stings like she died yesterday. Dare Nellie start thinking about boys again? Caleb Yoder in particular. But then there's the matter of this new faith, threatening to tear apart so many families and friends. And what about the things surrounding Suzy's death? Were the rumors true? Was she really that...worldly?This book. It was amazing. The mystery about Suzy kept me guessing. I never knew till the end what exactly went on in her life. The argument going on about the 2 religions gave a bit of suspense and a thrill. I got excited along with all the others about the new faith. But part of me wanted them to stay with the old ways, even though I don't agree with everything they did. And the romance. Oh! Caleb is so sweet! Why, oh why can't everyone just agree? Nellie Mae and Caleb are perfect for each other. Why must their families' faith keep them apart?This book left me excited and eager to start the second in the series, The Forbidden."}, {"userName": "Bev", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1755943-bev", "userReview": "Wonderbaar gut!

Should I devote so much of my reading time (six books in so many months isn't too much) to something that could be called trivial?Yes.Let me explain: I became a Christian my freshman year of college, just graduated in December, and am marrying the man who led me to the Lord in June. I haven't been taught to honor and love keeping a home nor have I had much Christian fellowship since coming to Christ.In The Parting--and the other Beverly Lewis books I've read--I find inspiration toward the domestic life that God started calling me to and gratitude for my relationship with Him that I struggled for so long to find. Kind of like the Amish characters in her novels who struggle between the Old Ways and a \"foreign gospel\" that offers assurance of salvation.I can hardly wait to read the next book in the series, eager to see how church matters turn out--not to mention things between Nellie and Caleb!"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/887026-michelle", "userReview": "This was really fun to read. I loved the peek into Amish life during the 1960's. They had some very interesting dating customs!I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series, but there is one major aspect of the books that I wish I could change. They are very focused on the Protestant doctrine of being \"saved by grace\" and how a sect of the Amish broke off and started living according to that. The author makes it an either-or dilemma: either you work your way to salvation or Jesus just gives it to you. It's hard for me to relate to the protagonist when she \"awakes\" to this new idea of \"free salvation.\" It's a personal problem, I know. I just would enjoy the books more if they were written for an LDS audience, I guess (resurrection is a free gift, for salvation we must live the gospel).Anyway. As long as I remind myself of what is really true and just read the book with the idea that Nellie is at least coming to a greater appreciation of our Savior, I really like reading it. :)"}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1401819-dianne", "userReview": "I am not a Christian and for this reason I normally stay way from Christian themed novels. For some reason I have gotten caught up in the Amish book craze and this one being free made it all the more palatable to me. I really love how these authors make learning about the Christian religion AND the Amish heritage and customs, very easy and pleasant.This book made none of this pleasant -I understand that this was a historically significant time amongst the Old Order Amish -but this author didn't simply steer us into the direction she wanted us to go, she preached me vehemently into a corner. The romance took a backseat to the conversion and splintering of this particular group.I wanted knowledge and romance with a dose of religion - what I did get is someone trying to convert me.Plus the fact that this book was written to not have an ending -with any of the plot lines -but to simply get you to buy the next book in this trilogy (and an expensive next two books I might add), was another disappointment and mark against this book for me."}, {"userName": "Rhayna Kramer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8237860-rhayna-kramer", "userReview": "A very intriguing, yet surprising outlook on Old Order Amish way of living in which content places it in a more unfavorable light; however, considering that the schisms took place in the 1960's, it should figure that not only \"Englischers\" were undergoing a revolution, but the Amish were experiencing religious and technological revolution.

(Lewis did actually find evidence of two such splits and based the series off of those). The hair that broke the camel's back (for lack of a better metaphor) was a real and true revival... many Old Order Amishmen searching out the Scripture for themselves and their families.The main character... Nellie Fisher... has to deal with many things in order to marry her sweetheart Caleb Yoder. Among them are her younger sister's death a hundred days before the beginning of the story, rumors of Suzy's wild Rumpsprighe, Suzy's revelation (through her diary), Nellie's father's conversion, the beginning of the schism and the pressures of Caleb's father... stay Old Order and away from the Fisher family or be denied the family land (something promised almost as a birthright).The main issues Lewis deals with in this book (and likely further in the forthcoming books of the series) are things that I have always wanted to get my head around when dealing with the Amish. I almost could not put this book down. (I had to at one point in order to go to work :D) I eagerly anticipate the publishing of the subsequent books in the series."}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16793358-deborah", "userReview": "Nellie Mae Fisher falls in love with Caleb Yoder at a tumultuous time in her Amish community. Her family is in the midst of dealing with the death of a child, and her community is at an impasse with the details of the Ordnung. Nellie tries to balance all the details of her life, but it seems like she is not meant to have everything.Will the church be able to settle their differences, or will a split be neccesary to placate all parties? Will Caleb's father accept them as a couple, or will something bigger keep them apart? Will her sister's death remain a mystery? Nellie wants to do what is right by God and the church, but is stubbornly holding on to Old Ways truly what God wants of her?I wasn't sure this series had enough to catch my interest, but boy, was I wrong! Somehow the idea of there being trouble in an Amish community in the 60's over the Ordnung rules and ordinances gives us a whole new look into this fascinating world. The plot kept taking new twists and turns, and I turned the page into something I never saw coming more than once.The family is torn apart when a daughter and sibling dies, and the questions that surround the mystery of her death incite the curiosity of this Old Order Amish household. Lewis has done it again with this first installment to The Courtship of Nellie Fisher series, and it is worth the read. It is based on actual events from a time and place where the redeeming grace of God was given freely to even the most stubborn of hearts."}, {"userName": "Tracie Sampson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2921320-tracie-sampson", "userReview": "I'm hooked on these Amish books. Maybe because I've always lived near the Amish and I've been intrigued by both the air of mystery around them and also by the allure of a simple lifestyle. I did not realize until I read this that the Old Order Amish controlled the Bible reading and beliefs of the members or that there had been an Amish revival. I enjoy reading about the old fashioned romances and the strong faith of the characters in Beverly Lewis' books. With that being said, I can overlook the fact that I really DISLIKE Lewis as a writer. Her stories are great but her writing leaves a lot to be desired. She usually forshadows so much with repetitive \"self reflecting\" questions (\"Did she ever find peace?\" \"Had she been as reckless as the rumors suggested?\"\"Did she hold a secret that would be revealed?\" - you get the drift) that you KNOW what is going to happen. Ask it once, fine, but Lewis has her characters reflecting on the same questions over and over. I want to scream \"YESSSSSS! NOW STOP ASKING!\" I always feel that her books could either A) have more depth and better developed characters or B) Be much shorter. It's like taking the long way home.

You see, I could care less about what happens to Nellie and her beau, Caleb, who are both overwhelmingly selfish, and I could care less about whether or not Nellie\u2019s parents, Rueben and Barbara, manage to spread the Gospel to their Old Order Amish community. The only people I care about are Rosanna and her husband -- who are unable to have children and are allowed to adopt Rosanna\u2019s cousin\u2019s twins, a rare occasion for the Amish -- but their story is essentially wrapped up by the end of The Parting.An easy read, The Parting is very formulaic -- boy and girl fall in love, but the introduction of the idea of being \u201csaved\u201d by Jesus threatens to tear both them and the Amish community apart. The story moves very slowly, although it did shed a lot of light on Amish dating customs. The Parting also is very heavily, overwhelmingly Christian, a feeling I didn\u2019t get with the other books of hers I\u2019ve read.

This story is about what happens within one family in the 60's when the Penn. Amish community went through a major transformation. I find a lot of their practices cult-like and controlling. It is hard to understand why perople would choose to obey so blindly. This book points out how they are only allowed to read certain sections of the Bible. The remainder of them are forbidden and if discovered are grounds for shunning. This particular time in their history left many families divided between spouses, parents and children, and siblings. Although, Lewis doesn't get too involved in the more political side of things, you can imagine the gravity of the situation when the young girl, Nellie, has to put her life and her feelings on hold so that her love can somehow find a way for his father to accept her.

Honestly, these are often the kind of books I look down my librarian nose at, but people often ask about them, so I thought I would pick one up. A few days of being sick, and this was almost just what I needed. This book tells of a schism that took place in the 60s in Pennsylvania between the Old Order and a new group. Caught in this parting, fictitious characters have their love tested by family differences and the rigid structure of the church. This book wasn\u2019t as terrible as I might have first thought.

I got my first Beverly Lewis book in the late 80's when it seemed the only place you could find her books was at an Amish inn in Middlebury, Indiana.Lewis' stories always involve the tension between Old Order Amish and the world outside, and this one is no different. However, what is different is how far Lewis goes into the theology and Scripture surrounding this tension. While ostensibly a romance about a young girl and the love of her life; the story is backdropped by an actual split in the Amish community that took place in 1966. The divisions drove hard into the community, and the relationship between the young girl and her suitor get swept up in the events, threatening to interfere with their planned future together."}, {"userName": "AlixJamie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3862413-alixjamie", "userReview": "Ahh, the beginning of a new series. I'm all ready to dig in and race through these books. Unfortunately, I can't. What is wrong with these people? Why don't they act normally? Why do they constantly puzzle over problems that I had figured out in chapter one? Why can't Beverly Lewis keep some plot twists a secret so that they can surprise you during the length of the book? Why does this thing have to be so...preachy? I barely made it through some of Reuben's mullings over God. Good Christian fiction doesn't have to preach to you for you to learn something.
