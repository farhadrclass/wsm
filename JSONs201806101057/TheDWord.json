Even though they have a young son together, Jordan hasn\u2019t been happy, and knows she wants more. But a year after she files for divorce, Jordan isn\u2019t so sure she made the right choice. Even more frustrating- her career. Jordan makes a living as a spiritual counselor, and relies on her feelings and dreams to help others see their future. But she can\u2019t see hers, and wonders if it\u2019s too late to get Kevin back. Kevin seems to have moved on easily from the divorce, while Jordan can\u2019t put clothes on his side of the closet yet. Can she win him back?Elle Ryan knew something felt off when she agreed to marry Chase. But it took just weeks before the wedding before Elle got the strength to call it off- hurting her boyfriend and his sister, who happens to be her best friend. Elle never thought she could meet a great guy at the dog park, but when she runs into Kevin Daniels and his dog Georgie, the sparks fly immediately. Though Elle comes with her own baggage, so does Kevin- his ex-wife Jordan and five year old son Max. Elle can clearly see Jordan wants Kevin back, and will try to do anything to get Elle out of his life. Can Elle win the battle?The D Word, co-authored by Liz Fenton and Lisa Steinke (the ladies behind the fabulous blog chicklitisnotdead.com) bring chick lit readers a story full of love and heartache, with twists in the story and enough light-hearted situations to make you smile even when you are reading about a not so happy topic. The story is told from both Jordan and Elle\u2019s point of view, and it\u2019s always interesting to get inside two character\u2019s minds and see how they think- and what they think of each other. I loved that Jordan was jealous of Elle for her red hair and fresh face, and Elle was jealous of Jordan for being blonde and sophisticated. Spot-on for how woman usually think! I was curious throughout the way about how all the characters would end up, because there was no clear path. And I could easily side with both Jordan and Elle, so that made me invested in both characters. The only think I didn\u2019t like was all the flashbacks. Those would yank me out of the story, and some I thought were really unnecessary. But other than that, a lot of fun to read and I think chick lit fans should put this on their to-read list!"}, {"userName": "Meredith Schorr", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4303919-meredith-schorr", "userReview": "This book had me hooked from page 1. First I ordered the free sample on my Kindle but after 30 pages, I had to keep going. The characters were just so real and I literally felt Jordan's pain as she watched Kevin falling for another woman right when she decided that divorcing might have been the biggest mistake of her life. I was rooting for a different ending and when it became clear a little past the half-way mark who would end up with who, I admit to not being as excited to pick it up but I got over it. The main characters were so damn relatable that it was easy to want them both to get a happy ending even if it wasn't the happy ending I would have preferred. My only critique of this book is that I didn't think it was necessary to add additional POVs besides Elle and Jordan and thought it was a bit of a distraction. I also felt like the tense changed between past and present but that might have been because much of the book was told in flashbacks.In a nutshell, I highly recommend this book. Great book to read pool-side, which I did!"}, {"userName": "Alison Fees", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5724313-alison-fees", "userReview": "I was very impressed with \"The D Word\". The authors were truly able to catch all the great emotion of the characters and make you feel what they feel. Divorce can be a tough issue to tackle but the authors did a wonderful job. I loved that I was able to see each point of the situation from the ex wife and the new girlfriend. It is tough to be on either side as the ladies soon discovered. I couldn't put this book down!"}, {"userName": "Marie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3460102-marie", "userReview": "Actually, I'd give this book almost 4 stars! Surprisingly entertaining - well written little chica book. Yes, it's about divorce - - and what happens to all involved before, during and after said D. Beautiful relationships, especially Kevin (love him) and Elle (a spitfire redhead). I was thoroughly entertained and needed a break from 'heavy' novels, biopics, etc."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/254596-mary", "userReview": "You can read my review here"}, {"userName": "Wall-to-wall books - wendy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2281076-wall-to-wall-books---wendy", "userReview": "I loved this book! I liked their other book - \"I'll Have Who She's Having\" but I liked this one even better!I could connect with it right away, having had a divorce myself. I loved the Main Character - Jordan. I could really relate to her. She was selfish, and mean at times but I still loved her personality. I mean how many of us have not been a brat a few times?Elle, the other female I could not relate to so much. I liked her just couldn't relate as much.I don't know if either of the writers have been divorced (I don't think they have.) but they certainly did their research because it seemed very real to me!I also LOVED that they threw in the little twist of the paranormal with Jordan being a \"Psychic\" being able to predict other people\u2019s futures. This made the book all the better for me, so much more fun!These are a few of my favorite lines - \"Trying to explain complicated adult issues to someone who thinks SpongeBob should run for President is exhausting. Kids think in Black and white, and this has been a year of gray.\"And this one I can totally relate to - \"I guess I never realized how much of my identity was tied up in being Kevin's wife and Max's mother.\"Those of us who are married with kids know how true that is.And last - \"I've been married for ten years, and I've always said that staying happy in your marriage is one of the hardest jobs you'll ever have. And once you start thinking the grass is greener, like my sister did, its impossible to recover.\"There are so many great quotes in this book, I could go on forever. But then you'd have no reason to read the book. Just do yourself a favor and get this book.Thank you, thank you Liz and Lisa, again, for putting out another great book! You have made a fan in me!"}, {"userName": "Susan (The Book Bag)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1516073-susan-the-book-bag", "userReview": "This is a great book. The subject could be rather depressing; a divorce, a break-up right before a wedding, and all of the characters trying to put the pieces of their lives back together. But it is very well written with humor and wisdom scattered throughout the book.The story is told using the point-of-view of both Jordan and Elle, the ex-wife and the new girlfriend. You get an understanding of what it is like to be on both sides of what can be a messy situation. You also get a little of the guy's points-of-view, which gives the reader the perspective of divorce and break-ups from all sides.One strong point that I think the authors try to make is that communication is the key to making relationships work, even if it means that the relationship has to end. When Jordan and Elle started communicating with those in their lives, issues were resolved and life could go on, they could get past the messy stuff.This is the first book that I have read by Liz and Lisa. I have followed their blog for a while now and it is a great one. These 2 gals seem to have such a great relationship and they sound like they would be tons of fun to be around. I will definitely read any other books that they write!"}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110328-melissa", "userReview": "http://chicklitcentraltheblog.blogspo..."}, {"userName": "Colleen Turner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3339335-colleen-turner", "userReview": "I first reviewed this book for the blog luxuryreading.comIn The D Word, two women decide to take matters into their own hands and do what they initially think will make them happy. Jordan, a spiritual counselor (do NOT call her a psychic!) who has unfortunately been unable to see down the path of her own marriage, is no longer happy and asks her husband, Kevin, for a divorce without the benefits of trying counseling. As the day comes to finally sign the divorce papers, she realizes that Kevin seems to be moving on while she is stuck behind. She starts wondering if she has made a big mistake, for herself and for their son, Max.Elle, a writer who archives for her readers the torment that is the singles scene, leaves her fianc\u00e9 only weeks before their wedding when she cannot shake the feeling that it just isn\u2019t meant to be. This decision doesn\u2019t only sever Elle from Chase but from his sister, Taylor, who has been her best friend since college. It also sets his crazy mother on her tail, accusing her of making a huge mistake and irrevocably breaking Chase\u2019s heart. Elle begins to wonder: did I make a mistake not marrying Chase and giving our relationship a chance?Elle and Jordan are soon thrown together when Elle and Kevin begin dating. Jordan becomes determined to put her family back together now that Kevin is outside her reach. She sets her sights on destroying Kevin and Elle\u2019s relationship, something that is tenuous as it is since Elle has always been scared of love and ready to run before someone else leaves her first. She begins to care deeply not only for Kevin but for Max and worries that she is going beyond the point of no return. When Jordan continues to stoop to new lows to win Kevin back and ultimately uses her spiritual gifts to dig up dirt on Elle and Chase\u2019s unresolved issues, it seems there is no way either woman will end up happy with the choices they are trying to make. Now that they both know life is not always greener on the other side, will they ever be able to be happy again and not destroy others in the process?The D Word is an exceptionally fun and gleaming example of what makes a great chick lit novel. It could be that I am the same age as the heroines in the book and that I am also somewhat of a reality television connoisseur, but I absolutely loved the numerous pop culture references. My only complaint is that Jordan was so unlikeable for the majority of the story. I understand this was necessary to show the full growth of her character, but I spent the bulk of the time hoping she eventually paid for her manipulations and selfishness. While I ended up with lukewarm feelings for her I would have enjoyed her storyline more if she didn\u2019t act so laissez faire about the harm she was doing to others.As a total package, The D Word will not disappoint lovers of chick lit and women\u2019s literature. So grab your bottle of Pinot, sit out in the sun and enjoy."}, {"userName": "Diana Baur", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1781918-diana-baur", "userReview": "A nice, fast moving novel about divorce as seen from the perspectives of two women - one in love with a man, and the other his ex-wife, who is having a tough time letting him go completely.

But instead, they find themselves vying for a relationship with the same divorced man.As a spiritual counselor, newly single mother Jordan Daniels makes her living predicting other people\u2019s futures. If only she could foresee her own. A year after filing for divorce from her husband, Kevin, he seems to be the one moving on effortlessly, while Jordan still can\u2019t bring herself to fill his old underwear drawer. But it\u2019s not until Jordan\u2019s polar opposite, Elle steals Kevin\u2019s heart, that Jordan becomes convinced she\u2019ll be replaced both as a wife and a mother to her five-year-old son, Max.When Elle met Kevin, the last thing she wanted was another relationship. Especially not with a man with baggage-she already had enough of her own. She left her fianc\u00e9, Chase right before their wedding to avoid the imminent D word, something she\u2019s convinced runs in her family like a disease. But a year later, she\u2019s no closer to becoming less skeptical about marriage.
