Shakespeare After eighteen years in the NYPD, Detective Sergeant Denny Malone has good cause for unease. The de facto king of Manhattan North has seen considerable upheaval in his kingdom. He may be, effectively, the head of this select unit, charged with going after gangs, drugs, and guns. \u201cDa Force\u201d may have unusually free rein to do as they see fit to accomplish their goals. But a turf war between competing providers of recreational pharmaceuticals is growing increasingly kinetic, with one of the combatants looking to purchase a considerable supply of death-dealing hardware. Not OK. The captain is pressing for a high-publicity bust. There is also the perennial political dance one must perform to keep the brass at One Police Plaza and the political suits from interfering with business as usual. Of course, what passes for business as usual might not look all that good splashed across the front pages of the local tabloids. Don Winslow - image from Milanonera.com Bribery may be the grease that keeps the wheels of civilization turning, but it leaves a lot of cops with very dirty hands. Denny is no saint, and no Serpico. He may mean well for the community he is charged with protecting, but his methods often lack the soft gleam of legality. We first meet him as he arrives in federal lockup. The novel then goes back to show how he got there. Slippery slope stuff. See the greased wheels above.  The street stays with you. It sinks into your pores and then your blood. And into your soul? Malone asks himself. You gonna blame that on the street too? Some of it, yeah. You\u2019ve been breathing corruption since you put on the shield, Malone thinks. Like you breathed in death that day in September. Corruption isn\u2019t just in the city\u2019s air, it\u2019s in its DNA, yours too.  Yeah, blame it on the city, blame it on New York. Blame it on the Job, It\u2019s too easy, it stops you from asking yourself the hard question. How did you get here? Like anyplace else. A step at a time.\nLines are crossed here with the frequency of runners reaching the end of the NYC marathon. Early on, Denny and his crew take out a major distributor, whack the principal, and skim off a significant portion of the captured product, a bit of an extra retirement fund. Some people are a tad upset by this. It\u2019s not exactly much of a secret, though, and there are those who would like to see Denny being saluted by the entire force in Dress Blues and white gloves while someone plays Taps. One of the great powers of this novel is the perspective offered on diverse forms of human behavior. Is Denny a brute for roughing up a guy who beat up a kid? Definitely outside the law, but are his actions effective? Denny really does care about the people in his kingdom. He cuts slack when possible, and brutalizes when it is called for. But the law seems a lot more of a recommendation than an absolute. Winslow offers a close up look at a dark element of police culture. How does being on the take work? Who gets what? How is money distributed? Who is it ok to accept bribes from? What is allowed that would otherwise be justiceable? And why do the cops here consider it ok? He offers as well a moving look at the human relationships that make up police life, the code of honor, the power of partnership, the requirement that all members of the team partake of the ill-gotten, if only as a means of self-protection, the wives who turn a blind eye to where that extra cash may have originated, and what their breadwinner may be up to when the crew parties hard, up to a point anyway. The interaction between the police and people in their area is rich with real affection, as well as the expected cynicism. Some of these scenes are stunningly moving, tissue worthy.How about the relationship between cops and the local criminal element? You might be reminded of those cartoons in which Bugs Bunny and Wile E. Coyote punch a time clock, go at it, then clock out at the end of the day, friends. The cops and criminals often seem cut from the same cloth, although the baddest of the bad guys are certainly much worse than the worst of the cops. And the bullets really kill. Winslow does not spare the one-percent, either, in his look at layers of amorality. Don Winslow is a seasoned writer at the pinnacle of his craft.\nMalone drives past the Wahi diner and the mural of a raven on 155th. Past the church of the Intercession, but it\u2019s too late for Intercession, past Trinity Cemetery and the Apollo Pharmacy, the Big Brother Barber shop, Hamilton Fruits and Vegetables and all the small gods of place, the personal shrines, the markers of his life on these streets that he loves like a husband loves a cheating wife, a father loves a wayward son.\nThere are wonderful nuggets of law enforcement intel in here. Like the notion of testilying. Or what is considered proper attire for a day on the stand. How about special celebratory nights for a crew? The upside of EMTs not taking a Hippocratic oath. Rules for note-taking on the job. How 9/11 saved the mob. Planning your crimes so they cross as many precinct boundaries as possible, increasing the likelihood that a paperwork snafu will botch a prosecution. On tribes within the force.Winslow has a Damon Runyon-esque ear for character names. My favorites were a CI named Nasty Ass, and another the cops call Oh No, Henry, and a linguist\u2019s appreciation for the local patois. Or maybe that would be another well-known teller of tales. (I think Dickens is one of the progenitors of noir fiction, writing as he did about the criminal underclass.) He peppers the novel with delicious small side-stories. Tales told in a bar by guys who have been spinning yarns for a lifetime. They give us occasional breathers from the breakneck pace. He takes on topics that will resonate, from Blue on Black violence, and the resulting reactions, to how the jails are functioning as de facto mental hospitals and detox centers. From a consideration of God and the Church (Denny is not a fan) to the impact of the job on people\u2019s lives. Denny recalls his father.  He was a cop on these streets, coming home in the morning after a graveyard shift with murder in his eyes, death in his nose and an icicle in his heart that never melted and eventually killed him. From how cops cope with the daily horrors to how the crime numbers are cooked to support whatever preconceived outcome was desired. On the Iron Pipeline, the route on which legal guns from Texas, Arizona, Alabama and the Carolinas become illegal guns in NYC. The politics of police tactics and voting. The hatred and respect the cops have for the best defense lawyers. Their relationship with reporters.  You trust a reporter like you trust a dog. You got a bone in your hand, you\u2019re feeding him, you\u2019re good. Your hand\u2019s empty, don\u2019t turn your back. You either feed the media or it eats you.Denny may be dirty, but you will be dashing along with him and hoping for the best. Maybe this whole situation can be fixed. He is a rich, multi-faceted character, and you will most definitely care what happens to him. Think Popeye (Gene Hackman) of The French Connection, or Lieutenant Matt Wozniak (Ray Liotta) on the wonderful TV show Shades of Blue.You might want to secure your seat belt and make sure that your Kevlar is all where it is supposed to be. This is a non-stop, rock\u2019em, sock\u2019em high-speed chase of a novel, a dizzying dash through an underworld of cops, criminals, and those caught in the middle, screeching stops, and doubling backs, hard lefts, harder rights, and Saturn V level acceleration. Once you catch your breath after finishing the final pages I expect you\u2019ll find yourself realizing just what a treat it has been. The Force is not just a great cop book, it is a great book, period, a Shakespearean tragedy of high ideals brought low, with one of the great cop characters of all time. The Force is an instant classic.

(This was a time when there wasn't such a glut of books featuring unlikely PIs.) Through the years I've read pretty much everything he has written, and I kept hoping there would be a book that would finally catapult him to the level of fame his talent so deserves.Simply put, his latest book, \nThe Force\n, is nothing short of a masterpiece, and it appears to be the book which might finally make Winslow a household name. While the story of corruption in the ranks of the NYPD may be a familiar one, in Winslow's hands, it is raw and gripping, one of those books you can't stop reading, and it feels incredibly current. It is definitely one which will make one hell of a movie. (And it already has been optioned, so it will be one to watch!)The Manhattan North Special Task Force, otherwise known as \"Da Force\" (as if said with a New York accent), is the NYPD's most elite unit. Created to crack down on the influx of violence, gangs, guns, and drugs infiltrating the city, particularly in the Harlem area, the detectives who serve on Da Force are among the toughest, smartest, most bad-ass cops the city has to offer. At the helm of this unit is Detective Sergeant Denny Malone, who relishes his power and all he can accomplish with it. And boy, does he love his job.\"All Da Force detectives are kings, but Malone\u2014with no disrespect intended to our Lord and Savior\u2014is the King of Kings. Manhattan North is the Kingdom of Malone. Like with any king, his subjects love him and fear him, revere him and loathe him, praise him and revile him. He has his loyalists and rivals, his sycophants and critics, his jesters and advisers, but he has no real friends. Except his partners.\"Malone and his partners have given every inch of themselves to the city. They've put themselves at serious risk of injury and death (and have the scars to show for it), and have witnessed the utter horrors that people inflict on one another, whether due to the influence of drugs and alcohol, for revenge or retribution, if they perceive someone is threatening their business interests, or simply out of boredom or cruelty. It's a job that wears you down, but Malone and his partners and his fellow officers love it anyway.\"The cops feel for the vics and hate the perps, but they can't feel too much or they can't do their jobs and they can't hate too much or they'll become the perps. So they develop a shell, a \"we hate everybody\" attitude force field around themselves that everyone can feel from ten feet away. You gotta have it, Malone knows, or this job kills you, physically or psychologically. Or both.\"The thing is, police work is a lot about \"what have you done for me lately,\" so no matter what heroic deeds Da Force does, there's always pressure from higher up to keep crime stats down, keep guns and drugs away, keep people from being murdered. Ultimately, to succeed, you can't be 100 percent idealistic, nor can you be 100 percent innocent. And through their years in the NYPD, Malone and his partners haven't done everything by the book. There may have been times when evidence or weapons were planted, when money changed hands to make things go away, where lawful procedures were skirted or avoided. If the end result is what is desired, what's the problem?When Da Force makes the biggest heroin bust in the city, they're hailed as hero cops. Yet Malone and his partners actually steal some of the drugs and some of the money before turning everything else in. They're entitled. But this sends them down their slipperiest slope yet, and when Malone catches the eye of the feds for a fairly routine (but still illegal) thing, he finds himself caught in a trap, and has to decide whether to save himself or betray his fellow officers, something he vowed he'd never do.\nThe Force\n is magnificently told\u2014it's a big novel with a big vision and a fairly large cast of characters, yet the cops at its center fully grab your attention. Malone is far from perfect and he'll admit that to anyone. He knows that somewhere along the line he and his comrades stepped out of line, but once you get used to the privilege and the perks and the money and the prestige, can you go back and admit your mistakes? This is a man so in love with the job and what they can achieve, he can't think of doing anything else in the world.Elements of the plot are definitely familiar, but woven together with Winslow's amazing storytelling, it is completely riveting, and I read nearly the entire book on a cross-country flight. Perhaps because of all the references to \nSerpico\n I kept seeing a young Al Pacino as Malone, but the characters and the images are so vivid, I watched the book play out in my head as I was reading it. I cannot wait to see this adapted into a movie, because in addition to the violence and bravado and corruption there are moments of true tenderness and emotion and vulnerability.As you might expect, there is a lot of violence in this book, and in a book which takes place in a culture greatly affected by racism, there is strong language and racial and cultural epithets used throughout. None of it felt gratuitous to me, but I know some may find that triggering or troublesome.Ever since I learned Winslow would be writing this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Now that I have, I am so excited about the response it has received from critics and readers across the country. He is definitely a writer worth reading, and whether you start with this book or one of his others, you're sure to find an excellent, exceptionally written story.

He is telling his story from a cell, but how did this king of the streets, at the top of his game, descend so low?When I first started reading this I thought or I hoped this wouldn't be a cliched viewpoint of every had cop story we hear about. The writing though was addictive, and I kept telling myself that this was the top pick in book page. The more I read the more I felt that rather than a cliched this was in your face realism, a realism I found so intense that my leg was jiggling up and down as I was reading. Do I agree with what they did? No, but these men are confronted daily with threats to their lives, drug, guns, gangs, the mob, cartels and expected to clean this up. Pressured from above, their Captain, the commissioner, the mayor, pressured by crime statistics, results wanted but the powers that be don't want to know how it is done as long as the numbers decreased. Nothing clear cut, morals are blurred, lines are blurred. Denny's character? He is not all one thing either, as complex as many of us are, kind and cruel, crooked and honest. It is easy to sit on my couch and disapprove of much here that I have read, but I have a feeling that in many large cities this happens often. This book has already been optioned as a film, and if done well it should prove to be an impactful one.This has also been compared to Mystic River and since I was blown away when I read that one and was blown away by the end of this, I find that a very apt comparison.

He\u2019s also one of the best cops the NYPD has who runs an elite unit nicknamed Da Force that takes on the worst cases involving gang and drug crimes, and he rules his Manhattan North turf along with the partners he loves like brothers. The thing is that Malone is also as crooked as a dog\u2019s back leg because he beats suspects, rips off drug dealers, routinely perjures himself, and takes kickbacks from defense attorneys for referrals. He also has a steady side gig as a bag man running cash between the mob and city officials as well as cutting deals with judges and prosecutors to throw out cases. However, Malone finds himself jammed up by the Feds and is soon wrapped up a situation where all his options are bad and everything he does is a betrayal of someone he cares for.If you\u2019ve watched The Shield this might sound a little familiar. There\u2019s also a lot of the same kind of behind-the-scenes exploration into all the ways that the system is broken which is what The Wire spent a lot of time exploring. This is Don Winslow exploring a lot of that same territory.I love The Shield. I love The Wire. I love Don Winslow\u2019s writing.So why didn\u2019t I love this?I think it\u2019s a matter of tone and character which are tied tightly together by the nature of Winslow\u2019s style. As he\u2019s in done in several other books Winslow uses a conversational stream-of-consciousness flow as narration. We\u2019re getting the story from Malone\u2019s point of view, but it\u2019s as if it\u2019s being told to us by a very good buddy of his who knew what he was thinking and feeling every step of the way as well as giving us the lowdown on the local history so that we understand the context of why everything is happening.Winslow is a master of this, but it went a little wrong for me this time. The other books where he used it such as Savages and Dawn Patrol were set in Southern California and had this laid back voice to them. Like some half-stoned surfer was telling you the tale over a Corona at some beachside bar. Since The Force is set in New York it now feels like we\u2019re being told the story in some grimy tavern over a shot and a beer, and the guy telling it is a streetwise cop with a go-fuck-yourself-if-you-don\u2019t-like-it attitude. And that\u2019s as it should be.However, the problem becomes that Malone is a NYPD cop who wants everyone to know that his balls are bigger than anybody else. When he gets into tight spots where those balls are being squeezed his reactions are always to push back hard, and since he\u2019s as much a criminal as anyone he ever arrested all of this starts to come out as blustery rationalizations. So it\u2019s a whole lot of the things a dirty cop is going throw out as reasons why it\u2019s all bullshit.. \u201cI\u2019m out there on the street risking my life like a real cop! The real crooks here are the politicians and the judges and the lawyers and the real estate swindlers. They\u2019re the ones who are really corrupt!\u201dAgain, that\u2019s as it should be, and it\u2019s a natural reaction for this type of character. In the context of the story it\u2019s also true. The issue becomes that it just goes on and on. And then on some more. Since it\u2019s told in such a bombastic in-your-face fashion it gets annoying. Winslow commits so hard to making Malone the biggest swinging dick in the room who refuses to admit defeat as well as responsibility for what he\u2019s done for so long that I actively started to root against him after a while.That\u2019s not to say that I\u2019m playing the old \u201cBut he\u2019s not a likeable character!\u201d card. He isn\u2019t really, but he\u2019s not supposed to be. Vic Mackey wasn\u2019t \u2018likeable\u2019 in The Shield, but the show managed the tricky balance of alternately making him the hero and an appalling villain at times. However, at the end of the show\u2019s run the story also had a definite moral judgement about him that was the culmination of the story. I think part of why this suffered in my opinion is that Winslow tries to play the same game by showing the good sides of Malone as a cop and person, but although he does lay a final verdict of a kind on Malone it feels half-hearted and weak.This is because Winslow continues to make excuses for Malone until the end by carrying on with the storylines regarding the outside corruption so it seems like he tried to split the difference and make Malone both the bad guy and the victim. Which I can see to a certain extent. It is ridiculous to nail a cop to the wall for taking a free cup of coffee while a politician can collect huge campaign donations from business people he can help, and that's all perfectly legal. However, what Malone did goes way beyond taking a cup of coffee, and he was happy to go along with the corruption while it helped make him one of the most connected cops in the city so him crying and beating his chest about it when he gets his hand caught in the cookie jar just came across as self-serving garbage to me after a while.I realize that a lot of my friends on here have read and loved this book, and I can see why. Winslow is a great crime writer and this is a helluva tale about a dirty cop with all kinds of action and shady deals in a corrupt city. There\u2019s a lot to like, and maybe if I\u2019d never seen an excellent morality tale about one dirty cop with The Shield or a grim portrayal of how corruption and bureaucracy can consume a city like The Wire I would have liked this more. As it is, I couldn\u2019t help but thinking that I\u2019ve heard this story a couple of times before, and I liked those versions better.It\u2019s certainly not a bad book, but it will be well down my Winslow rankings."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol", "userReview": "You tell me.

At the heart of the story is Detective Sergeant Denny Malone of the N.Y.P.D, a deeply flawed character in a corrupt and brutally flawed system.Malone runs a small elite task force charged with chasing down drug dealers, gun runners, gang members and other such scum. He thinks of himself as the \"King of Manhattan North,\" and to Malone's way of thinking, the ends almost always justify the means. He and his team often act outside of the law in order to \"police\" the city, and for the most part, their superiors and the Powers That Be turn a blind eye. In a city riven by race and class, the P.D.'s brass want good statistics and the citizens just want the criminals kept away from their doorsteps. How that happens is not much of a concern to any of them.Denny Malone comes from a long line of policemen, and all he ever wanted was to be a good cop. But from almost the moment he left the Academy, Malone allowed himself to be slowly corrupted until now, he's not any better than and not much different from the thugs he's supposed to be chasing. He and his team administer justice as they see fit, and along the way they rip off cash and drugs, making themselves a fortune in the process. They live like princes, but the day of reckoning is surely coming and when it does, Denny Malone will be sorely tested.Malone is one of the most compelling figures in crime fiction to come along in years, and Winslow's indictment of the police force, the prosecutors, the lawyers and the politicians who run New York City is searing. This is one of the most depressing stories you'll ever read, and one of the most beautifully written. It's like watching a train wreck unfolding in slow motion. You can't take your eyes off it, and once you pick up this book you cannot put it down until you've reluctantly read the final page.

Overall, 'The Force' is not as good as his Cartel series (The Power of the Dog, The Cartel), but in my opinion better than Savages. Winslow doesn't pull many punches when dealing with drug dealers, dirty cops, dirty politicos, etc. He really does deserve some major props from jumping right into the Black Lives Matter, Blue-on-Black dynamics. The novel's characters are arranged in such a way that the issues of Ferguson, NYC, Baltimore, LA, etc., are inescapable from the novel's narrative. You can't really tell a story about NYC cops and corruption and NOT step into issues of race. Winslow doesn't flinch. Which is hard to do. Often with the PoPo and the military their is this varnish of heroism that covers-up a lot of individual bad behavior. Some of my best friends are cops and grunts (or former cops and grunts) and they are just as dickish and racist as the rest of the population. Some of the smartest, hardest working folks I know are cops, but the blue uniform also sometimes wraps around some of the most insecure and stupid idiots as well.Winslow is a helluva story teller and a decent, nice guy. I met him a couple weeks ago at a lecture and book signing and his reputation for being kind to his fans was evident. The publicity grind (books signings, lecturs, readings, etc) that all writers do more or less appears to be mostly grind, but Winslow was cheerful, funny, kind, patient, and carries a natural gift for engaging people and a real curiosity about humanity. In his work it is obvious that he is seeking first a good story, but he is also very interested in people. He doesn't give a shit if it cop or criminal, he likes finding the bends, the cracks, and the dark corners.I did get to ask him a questions: \"Which contemporary writers intimidate you? Make you feel like hanging it up? Question why you even write because they are THAT good?\"Winslow's answer:1. Dennis Lehane2. Richard Russo3.

I\u2019ve switched cities and I\u2019ve switched jobs and now I ride the train to work in the morning and the train back home at night. It\u2019s a far cry from my former life, when it was a ten-minute trip, door-to-door, to get to my old office. Nine minutes if I hit the lights just so.I read on the train, and that requires a certain kind of book. It can\u2019t be a throwaway title, a so-called \u201cbeach read\u201d or \u201cguilty pleasure,\u201d because that won\u2019t hold my attention, and if it\u2019s not holding my attention, then I\u2019m intensely focused on the fact that I\u2019m on a noisy, rattling train. On the other hand, it can\u2019t be super-complicated or dense, since there are constant interruptions. In other words, I need a book that is both exceptionally captivating but also one that I can start and stop with ease. Don Winslow\u2019s The Force turned out to be the perfect choice for my inaugural Metro Link book-club-of-one. In fact, as soon as I finished, I began to miss it. The Force is a blistering, fast-paced, foul-mouthed, tour-de-violence that follows the rise and fall of corrupt New York super-cop Dennis Malone. On the first page, you are told that Malone is in jail. Winslow then flashes back to show you how he got there. To show you how a good officer started engaging in drug rips, graft, beat-downs, and murder, rationalizing the descent at every point along the way. The basic ingredients of The Force are pretty recognizable. I mean, \u201ccorrupt cop\u201d is almost its own genre. This will feel incredibly familiar to anyone who has watched The Shield or American Gangster or Training Day (Denzel Washington\u2019s Alonzo Harris feels like a model for Malone). Moreover, Winslow\u2019s combination of propulsive plot, local knowledge, grasp of vernacular and idiom, and sprinkling of social commentary follows in the footsteps of such masters as Richard Price and David Simon.This is not a criticism by any means. I think it\u2019s great when a writer of talent decides to use that skill in a genre piece. It would be going too far to say that Winslow redefines the life-on-the-streets novel. Certainly, though, he delivers a stunning epic of cops and drug dealers and cops who are drug dealers. Winslow\u2019s change to the usual playbook is in his writing style. The Force is 479 pages long, but it reads at about half that length. The reason is that most of the story is told in single sentence paragraphs. Short, vivid bursts of hardened prose. It\u2019s hard to explain why this works so well, but it does. From the beginning, Winslow creates a staccato rhythm that draws you in and holds you in the story. It\u2019s the kind of book that, after you put it down, you look forward to picking back up. Unlike The Power of the Dog, Winslow\u2019s sprawling saga of the international drug trade, The Force remains claustrophobically attached to Malone, so that you only know as much as he knows. This is important, because there is a lot going on. The layers of corruption through which Malone passes sets up a series of crosses, double-crosses, and triple-crosses that leave him (and you) guessing the loyalties of the other players. And there are a lot of other players: cops, Feds, street-slingers, mobsters, drug kingpins, and civilians caught in the crossfire. According to Winslow, The Force is the product of years of intense research. Much of that comes through in obvious ways, such as dialogue that captures specific speech patterns, slang, and terms of art. It also comes through in Winslow\u2019s evocation of New York City, often giving you a street-by-street tour. Through Malone he seems to channel a rough fondness for the place: Malone comes off the bridge near Fort Wadsworth, where the New York marathon starts, gets off on Hylan and drives down through Donegan Hills, past Last Chance Pond, and then takes a left onto Hamden Avenue. The old neighborhood. Nothing special about it, just your basic East Shore block of nice single-family homes, mostly Irish or Italian, a lot of cops and firefighters. A good place to raise kids. The truth is he just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.The incredible freakin\u2019 boredom. Couldn\u2019t stand coming back from busts, the stakeouts, the roofs, the alleys, the chases to what, Hylan Plaza, Pathmark, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Gamestop. He\u2019d come home from a tour jacked up from speed, adrenaline, fear, anger, sadness, rage, and then go to someone\u2019s cookie-cutter house to play Mexican Train or Monopoly or nickel poker. And they were nice people and he\u2019d feel guilty about sitting there sipping their wine coolers and making small talk when what he really wanted was to be back on the street in hot, smelly, noisy, dangerous, fun, interesting, stimulating, infuriating Harlem with the real people and the families and the hustlers, the slingers, the whores.The poets, the artists, the dreamers.Winslow has written extensively about the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d so it is not surprising that drugs are the engine driving the crime in The Force. Specifically, heroin, which as Malone points out, only became an \u201cepidemic\u201d once white people started dying. Whites started to get opium-based pills from their physicians \u2013 oxycodone, Vicodin, that shit. But it was expensive and doctors were reluctant to prescribe too much for exactly the fear of addiction. So the white folks went to the open market and the pills became a street drug. It was all very nice and civilized until the Sinaloa Cartel down in Mexico made a corporate decision that it could undersell the big American pharmaceutical companies by raising production of its heroin, thereby reducing the price. As an incentive, they also increased its potency.The addicted white Americans found that Mexican \u201ccinnamon\u201d heroin was cheaper and stronger than the pills and started shooting it into their veins\u2026The verisimilitude of The Force is part of what makes it so fascinating. You know you are reading fiction, but many parts of it, especially the background context, feels like truth, and in many instances, is truth. He grounds things well enough that I barely minded the preposterousness of some of his set-pieces and narrative twists. Still, there is a warning here. Winslow makes a lot of claims with regards to corruption, racketeering, and systemic rot. The farther you get into The Force, the higher that corruption seems to go. In a way, Winslow\u2019s writing becomes slyly insinuating. Does he know something the rest of us don\u2019t? I started to wonder. And if he does, why doesn\u2019t he just come out and say it? I\u2019ll admit to a bit of frustration on this score, though that is always the price to pay when you mix facts with fiction. Perhaps more troubling is Winslow\u2019s overall view of law enforcement. Throughout The Force, most of the cops you are introduced to are on the take. Whether it is small gifts or big payouts, everybody is getting something. Winslow, through Malone, consistently rationalizes this with the defense that \u201ceveryone is doing it.\u201d It\u2019d be easy to pass this off as a characterization, except that Winslow goes to great lengths, outside the actual narrative, to dedicate his story to police officers, and to recount the time he spent with them while researching. Obviously, the drug wars being fought on America\u2019s city streets are ethically ambiguous. But you can tell an ethically ambiguous tale while maintaining some sort of moral clarity. David Simon does this incredibly well in Homicide and The Corner. Here, though, I was a bit puzzled by Winslow\u2019s conclusion: Cops are crooked but it\u2019s okay because they\u2019re cops. That doesn\u2019t detract from The Force by any means. It\u2019s just something I pondered while waiting for the train to arrive. Besides, it\u2019s really a testament to how good The Force actually is. You can read it as a hardboiled thriller, with shootouts, tough talking, and labyrinthine plot-turns. You can read it as a character study tracing the downfall of a once-good man. Or you can read it as a tragedy of failed policies and a failed system that has captured a lot of good people and turned them into villainous versions of themselves."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "Dirty Cops Instant Classic of Shakespearean ProportionsRevised/Complete Review--8/6/17He who \"fights monsters,\" Nietzsche warned, \"should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster.\" As the novel opens, NYPD Detective Sergeant Denny Malone is being held in a federal lockup, accused of being a \"dirty cop\" into whom the abyss now gazes.Malone is the de facto leader of NYPD's most elite crime-fighting unit, the Manhattan North Special Task Force, whose mission is to rid Washington Heights and the more gentrified Harlem of drugs and guns. Dubbed \"king of Manhattan North,\" Malone wears the crown proudly. Somewhere on the path from his beginning as a young beat cop from Staten Island--son of a hero Irish cop--Malone lost perspective, became greedy, self-serving, and forgot what it means to be a guardian of his community.The novel brings readers up to Malone's current incarceration by flashbacks into his career, routine, snitches, the brotherhood of partners and his moral fall from grace. Though one might complain that the background is overlong, I found it fascinating. Winslow spent years researching the NYPD culture and interviewing street cops, veteran detectives and high-ranking police bureaucrats for this novel which he has suffused with tales he gathered from the home and street lives of New York's finest. He dedicated the book to law enforcement employees murdered in the line of duty over the time he was writing The Force.\" The list covers nearly three pages.Winslow describes the \"love-hate relationship\" between cops and the community: \n\"The cops feel for the vic's and hate the perps, but they can't feel too much or they can't do their jobs and they can't hate too much or they'll become the perps. So they develop a shell, a we-hate-everybody attitude forcefield around themselves that everyone can feel from ten feet away. You gotta have it, Malone knows, or this job kills you, physically or psychologically or both.\"\nMalone developed an interesting take on the New York Times' declaration of a heroin epidemic: \"it's only an epidemic, of course, because now white people are dying.\" He goes on to explain how whites started getting hooked on opioids prescribed by their physicians who stopped prescribing for fear of this very addiction. So white folks went to the open market and opioids became a high-priced street drug. Meanwhile, the Mexican Sinoloa Cartel made an executive decision to undercut American pharmaceutical companies by increasing production, thus lowering prices, of an easier-made form of heroin more potent than opioids. Addicted white Americans, finding this black-tar heroin cheaper and stronger than lortab, norco, vicodin, oxycontin and the like, began shooting up, overdosing and many times dying. \"Malone literally saw it happening. He and his team busted more bridge-and-tunnel junkies, suburban housewives and upper Eastside madonnas than they could count.\"Winslow provides a closer look at the dark culture of the NYPD such as the hatred and respect cops have for top criminal defense attorneys, the practice of \"testilying\" for the \"greater good,\" how jails function as de facto hospitals and detox centers, and cops' relationship with reporters: \"You trust a reporter like you trust a dog. You got a bone in your hand, you're feeding him, you're good. Your hand is empty, don't turn your back. You either feed the media or it eats you.\" As to \"suits who love their numbers,\" Malone calls them a \"new management breed of cops\" like \"the sabermetrics baseball people [who] believe the numbers say it all, and when the numbers don't say what they want them to, they massage them like Koreans on Eighth Avenue until they get a happy ending.\"In Detective Sergeant Denny Malone, Don Winslow has created a multi-faceted anti-hero you will care about as a \"father loves a wayward son,\" and who, toward the denouement, you might find yourself pulling for as the noble savage in a system permeated by corruption and duplicity. This sweeping Shakespearean tragedy of character and moral order tracks the downward spiral of a talented and decorated police detective who goes bad \"step by step.\" It's a tale played out down the dark alleys of Manhattan North, among warring clans ruled by corrupt kings, fighting over turf, fortunes and modern-day artillery, as all of New York City is torqued into a racial tinderbox while awaiting a grand jury's ruling on a white cop killing an unarmed black kid. If you've not heard of Don Winslow, you will soon. He writes highly suspenseful and realistic crime-fiction, so timely they are nearly prescient. Winslow is the best-selling author of \"The Cartel,\" a 2015 epic about narco warfare in Mexico. Last September--nine months prior to the June 19 publication of The Force--20th Century Fox gave him a seven-figure deal for the film rights--a film Ridley Scott will produce and may direct. Fox and Scott already have \"The Cartel\" in pre-production. Winslow builds up friction by showing how Malone crossed the line incrementally over the years: shaking down criminals, accepting favors, taking cuts, administering vigilante justice on his own and as favors, and acting as go-between for criminal defense attorneys and venal ADAs. What put him in the incinerator though was the biggest heroin bust in the city's history, which would have been twice as large had he and his partners not taken half the cash and product; this and the fact that Malone executed the drug kingpin as a vendetta for his gang's murdering a snitch's wife and kids.Malone is painfully aware he is corrupt. He is wracked with guilt over leaving his wife and three kids in Staten Island, while feeling like how he's the worst thing in the world for his beautiful black girlfriend, given her addiction to heroin. And yet, he simply cannot stop; it's not just his greed, but his arrogance: \"You need the money, the cash flow,\" he tells himself, \"but it's more than that, admit it. You love the game. The thrill, the taking off the bad guys, even the danger, the idea that you might get caught.\u201d To cope with the stress of the job and his internal moral turmoil, Malone partakes of dexedrine, booze, hash and veneries. The feds have him and his only way out is informing on those higher up the chain. Malone also faces betraying his partners, something he swore he'd never do, that is until the feds told him if he didn't they would put his wife in jail, take away his house and leave his kids without parents or a home.The pressure on Malone ignites as he finds himself attacked from all sides: his by-the-book captain, internal affairs, federal investigators, the U.S. Attorney, the Harlem gangs, his partners who suspect he might be betraying them, the mob for which he does favors, other cops who think he is a rat, the police commissioner, and a mayor's office afraid he knows too much, not to mention Malone's own personal demons.Ultimately, the novel is an indictment of a bedlam system rife with corruption, graft and favors for the penthouse set, giving color to the phrase, \"the fish always stinks from the head downwards.\"In the lead-up to the oddly satisfying, cinematic denouement, Winslow ratchets up the racial tension as Malone faces a defining choice that could touch off \"the fire this time\": whether he is still a real cop who will act as protector of the residents of Manhattan North or a former cop who chooses to avoid penance for his crimes because he's made a deal with the powers-that-be to help hide a high crime.Winslow takes the reader into a concrete world of gangs and guns, the darkness of NYPD culture, and a racially combustible city set to incinerate. Told to the rhythmic beat of the NYC cop vernacular, this epic boils with vicious battles, blood-soaked hands holding dying cops, and double-crosses by rat bastards to brew up an atmosphere in which, as in Macbeth's Scotland, \"foul is fair and fair is foul.\"Corruptio optimi pessima (Corruption of the best becomes the worst)"}, {"userName": "Panagiotis", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2017",

A book where you simultaneously want to see what the hell happens on the next page but also want to slow down your reading because you don't want it to end. A book that on one hand is crazily entertaining but also makes you hit Google and read articles to learn more about its timely issues.\n\nHell isn't having no choice. It's having to make a choice between horrific things.\n\nAt the risk of this sounding like hyperbole, Don Winslow takes a crooked cop story that's a combination of The Shield and The Wire (yes, it's just as amazing as that sounds), and crafts: 1) One of the best books I've read this year2) What might have to be considered the Best Cop Novel, perhaps ever.3) The best Richard Price novel Richard Price never wrote.This is the third book by Don Winslow that I've given 5 stars to. The guy really does have a talent for slinging stories that are both heavily engaging with a lasting effect and also very researched and informative. A great storyteller that should have the same success as the most popular authors. One of the things that really impressed me was how awesome Winslow's attention to detail is and how EVERY SINGLE THING matters by the end. Everything character, every idea, even every setting connects in important ways and it always excites me to see an author so dedicated to making that happen. \n\nYou tell yourself what you gotta tell yourself to do what you gotta do. And sometimes you even fuckin' believe it.\n\nThe story of Manhattan Task Force Detective Denny Malone is the epic tragedy of a crooked city cop at the top of his game slowly losing his grip on his kingdom. Throughout the novel, it's mesmerizing to witness him struggle to keep control and to get his head out from under the slowly rising waters of corruption, lies, dirty deeds and violence created by both he and the system he's a part of. \n\nAll cats are gray in the dark.\n\nTrust me, this will be seen as one of THE books of the year."}, {"userName": "Roxane", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151637-roxane", "userReview": "I love Don Winslow's writing (The Cartel is a favorite) but this book missed the mark. The overall story, of police corruption, from the POV of a corrupt cop, is compelling but the writing just didn't work for me. There were all kinds of style tics and flourishes that kept pulling me out of the story. The use of the N word so much, got under my skin though I understand the context within which it was used and that it was being used for authenticity's sake. Oh there was this thing with rap lyrics that just made me cringe. I cringe even remembering it. The pacing felt off. The first part was so slow and then at the end everything felt rushed. The overall ending was super readable and had me turning the pages faster and faster. The action was well written and one character, Claudette, I found was beautifully written. The author clearly did a ton of research and at times it felt like he was just showing how much research he did. Like we get it. You know a lot about cops but let's get back to the story please!

A group that takes bribes and payouts, steals what should have been confiscated from busts, runs prostitutes, uses uppers and downers to get through the day, and more. This group also takes pride in their work, considers each other to be closer than blood, trusts each other with their lives, and truly wants good to triumph over evil.The problem is, the distinction between good and evil becomes increasingly murky - step by step. It's the insidious fall from grace of Denny Malone, the King of Manhattan North, and the leader of The Force, that fascinated me more than anything. He could have been anything - a lawyer, a politician, a teacher, a cabinet maker, whatever. His profession didn't matter to me so much. It's the step-by-step fall into the muck that this book is about. It's ending up where you never thought you ever would, as if you sleepwalked into a nightmare world. \"How did I get here?\" One little compromise and one little lie and one little secret, and then another. And then they get bigger. And they pile up and up and up and suddenly you're on top, but trapped by this new false world you've built, and there's no where to go but down.Of course, it IS all about being a cop, and how much of the system is rotten and unfair and almost unfixable. It's about race and poverty and how even a junkie can have a heart and have something to teach a king.Though it may not win any prestigious literary awards, Don Winslow is at the top of his game here, building tension and conflict as well as depth.

It was an exciting trip through the Big Apple with New York City's finest. It came fully enriched with profane police lingo and gangbanger street slang. Languages unto themselves. Action-packed scenes followed this character-driven storyline through the streets and alleyways of upper Manhattan. This superbly-written storyline did not fail to deliver a stunning, dramatic ending.Detective Sergeant Denny Malone was kingpin of the Manhattan North Special Task Force. NYPD's most respected, elite unit. They were responsible for reducing violent crimes and drugs in their precinct. No matter what it took, who they rolled over, they got the job done. It could be said, they were the CIA of the NYPD Blue. After eighteen years on the force, Denny had seen it all. Most despicable though were all the politicians, lawyers, police brass and drug dealers getting rich from all the dirty money. Big-time corruption was everywhere. It seemed everybody had their hands in it. Everybody except Denny. Except his crew. They were the ones that took the risks. They were the ones that went through the doors. Down the stairwells. Why shouldn't they be sharing in the cream? They were the most deserving of getting their just slice of the pie. Real money. Not just complimentary coffee and a donut.Watching everyone get rich from funds that went under the table had finally gotten to him. Not getting any younger, he was approaching his twenty and would like to have a comfortable nest egg put away before leaving the force. His salary alone would not make it happen. His two closest teammates, Russo and Montague were on the same page. Their opportunity to make the big bucks was either now or never. Not when they retired from the force. Too late. All that was needed was one big score to set them all up. They knew if caught, they risked their job, their pension and even jail time. And jail is the last place they'd want to be. Could they pull it off? Put it all on the line? Only one way to find out."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24770184-sandy", "userReview": "I\u2019m late to the party with this one & there are already a ton of reviews to help you decide whether or not to add it to your TBR pile. I doubt I have anything new to add so I\u2019ll just toss out a few thoughts.First of all, this came with an incredible amount of buzz\u2026always dangerous. But I picked it up after hearing it compared to Ken Bruen, an author I\u2019ve long admired.I\u2019ll be honest\u2026by the time I reached about 150 pages it was firmly in 3 star territory. Denny Malone is the MC & we spend a massive amount of time in his head. Every character & location is seen through his personal lens & it\u2019s a somewhat distorted view. As he tours his \u201ckingdom\u201d we get a full history lesson on every colleague, criminal, building & intersection that comes to mind as he reminisces about his impressive career. I confess I found this part a tough slog as it\u2019s all Denny all the time & I can\u2019t say I particularly enjoyed his company.The story picked up at about the 200 page mark as the plot finally kicked in & things got interesting. Other characters began to get more air time & they\u2019re a compelling crew from all walks. Very few of them come off well & Machiavelli himself wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. The level of corruption on all sides is breathtaking & there\u2019s no question of it ending well, just who will be left standing. Winslow\u2019s knowledge of the history of New York\u2019s crime, cops, politicians & scandals is encyclopedic. I can\u2019t begin to imagine the hours of research & the whole thing reads like a dark, violent love letter to the city.Perhaps that is where the comparisons to Bruen came from. His books are also bleak, gritty cop tales. But that\u2019s where any similarity ends. His MC Jack Taylor is far from angelic but is honest with himself about who he is, unlike Malone who shies away from examining himself (and his motives) too closely. Instead he convinces himself he\u2019s a man of the people & doing everything for the sake of the city he loves. Make no mistake\u2026Denny is all about Denny. Taylor\u2019s philosophical musings are full of self deprecating black humour & combined with Bruen\u2019s elegiac prose, the result is a character you become invested in. For me, that makes all the difference. So while I can stand back & admire this book as a whole, ultimately I just couldn\u2019t muster enough interest in Denny\u2019s fate & it was other characters that kept me reading.Renewed pace & intricate plotting in the second half bumped it up to 4 stars. But as usual, it\u2019s all about personal taste & there are many glowing reviews on here that may give you a better idea of what to expect."}, {"userName": "Ammar", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3569723-ammar", "userReview": "Amazing novel... reads like a corrupted police movie.. packed with action, guilt, blood, a sea of guns and drugs.. the dens and clubs of the underworld.. the deep pockets of corrupted politicians, city hall, Feds, other cops, Cartels, drug lords.

The NYPD is the biggest gang on the streets and it\u2019s a turf war. But like in Scorsese\u2019s film, the Feds are the biggest gang of all.Winslow describes a New York police department task force team, assigned a section of North Manhattan, who patrols for guns, drugs, and every sort of crime. The leader of the task force team, Dennis Malone, is an old school Irish cop whose line has blurred \u2013 by becoming the toughest man on the streets to protect and serve, he\u2019s also become the same kind of criminal he\u2019s sworn to bring to justice.But it\u2019s complicated. This is not just a dirty cop story, about a young idealistic police officer who crossed a line early and then kept going deeper and deeper into the dark side. Malone is still a cop and wants to do the right thing \u2013 wants to serve and protect and keep the neighborhoods safe and bring criminals to justice. He wants to be a good father and to be the kind of cop that his father was and much of his inner turmoil is about the conflict between doing what is right while also doing it legally.At one point he says something like \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll fight fair when everyone else does.\u201d In other words, following the procedure and observing constitutional and civil rights runs contrary to practicing the actual methods of bringing justice. Malone has tapped into a primitive, street justice where a beating \u2013 or even an execution \u2013 serves the greater good more than what is sanctioned by law.Winslow also explores the ideas of corruption in the context of public service and of double standards that exist and what levels of corruption are tolerated and even accepted. Malone observes that what is OK for the rich and famous, the politically well-connected and mainstays of society is seen as abhorrent when committed by cops, the blue-collar workers of our criminal justice system, on the streets and in the trenches. Where is the line drawn? A free cup of coffee and a sandwich? A favor? When does this become a bribe or graft?Winslow pulls no punches here, Malone has crossed a line \u2013 he is a dirty cop. He is the Nietzschean gazer into the abyss, he is Conrad\u2019s Kurtz. But Winslow\u2019s Hollow Man still feels and loves and regrets and is torn asunder by the conflicting powers of the most fundamental ideas about what is right and wrong.Winslow\u2019s narrative style is a fast paced and frenetic stream of consciousness dialogue and internal monologue wherein we analyze the motivations behind Malone\u2019s actions and he shares with the reader a character study of a tortured soul. Malone is drawn not so much as an anti-hero but rather as a tragic hero \u2013 we know where his path leads but we cannot look away as he confronts his demons and walks resolutely towards an absolution that may not be recognized by society but one that is ultimately even more personal and real.

Don Winslow used to write tight little murder mysteries that were super cool to read and full of pop culture references, he now masters the huge, sprawling, multi-layered, ambitious, expansive, intricately-plotted behemoths that seem so real it's almost like you are reading a case file or listening to actual cops tell their stories. This is not a good guys vs. bad guys kind of book and don't go into this if you are expecting warm fuzzies or anything like that, but you will get a seemingly real web of people and institutions trying to hold things together the best way they know how, and seeing as how everyone is human, mistakes will be made.

Malone and company \u201chold the line\u201d separating the drugs and violence of the gangs from the \u201cgood people\u201d of Manhattan - a task easier said than done. As Da Force often trudges through the mud, they\u2019re bound to get dirty so when Malone gets caught by the Feds during one of his unsavory dealings, the resulting damage threatens to destroy Da Force and the fragile peace between the NYPD and the citizens of New York.Denny Malone is a deeply flawed character. He\u2019s a hero cop, but as dirty as they come. He\u2019s a family man, but he tossed his wife and kids aside for The Force. He puts on a strong front, but is conflicted and damaged to his core. The night and day of his personality is what makes him so compelling. One minute you\u2019re sympathizing with the guy, the next you think he\u2019s full of shit.Malone\u2019s compatriots - the band of brothers that make up The Force - are also corrupt, yet just as noble. One of the core questions of the novel is: do the ends justify the means? One of the better quotes (and there are many), \u201cHow do you cross the line? One step at a time\u201d rings true for not only \u201cDa Force\u201d but also their enemies. Malone\u2019s tales of walking in on gruesome crime scenes where there are no lines, where children have been murdered in the trenches of a never ending drug war juxtapose against cops gunning down unarmed criminals, swiping drugs from crime scenes and taking payoffs from wise guys. Everyone is dirty and no one wants to take a bath.Although the entire book provided me with an excellent experience, Winslow\u2019s writing in the final one hundred pages alone is some of the finest work I\u2019ve ever read in crime fiction. I\u2019m not talking about stylish prose, although his writing hits hard in short bursts like a machine gun, I\u2019m talking about a level of sustained tension that kept the story at a boiling point. I know this is some heavy praise, but the way in which this story unfolds is downright captivating.The Force is easily the best novel I\u2019ve read in 2017 and I struggle to think it\u2019s going to be topped this year. With The Force, Don Winslow has produced a tightly researched, expertly crafted novel that gripped me from start to finish."}, {"userName": "Renee (itsbooktalk.com)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3128281-renee-itsbooktalk-com", "userReview": "You can find all my reviews at www.itsbooktalk.comIs it possible that July has brought me my top read of 2017? It's very likely unless something else truly phenomenal comes along between now and Dec 31 to knock this blockbuster off it's perch on the tippy top of my top reads shelf. There's definitely a reason this was published in June because this is the perfect summer read to take to the beach, pool or patio. A crime thriller is the perfect summer read you may be asking? Oh yes, just ask Time, Amazon, The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, Newsday, Miami-Herald and more since they all named\u00a0The Force\u00a0a must read this summer. Just don't forget to slather on your sunscreen because once you start reading this addicting saga of a police thriller you'll forget everything else!The blurb above tells you all you need to know about Sgt. Denny Malone, \"King\" of The Manhattan North Special Task Force. He'll be the first to also tell you (repeatedly so) that he's a hero cop. \u00a0You see, Denny narrates the story, first in the prologue where he tells us he's in a federal jail cell and then throughout the rest of the novel (he details what led to him being in federal jail) as we get an inside, front row, in your face perspective of Denny's often harsh, racist observations and illegal actions along with his searing rationalizations of why he's turned dirty. There are\u00a0no narrative\u00a0tricks\u00a0or multiple points of view in the telling of this story. Winslow grabs you immediately with acute observations, single line sentences, short paragraphs and dialogue that snaps, crackles and pops so fast your head will spin and your eyes will barely be able to keep up. THIS is how you tell a story and that's what makes this book so utterly fantastic! Let me pause here and say the writing is by no means always perfect. There were times I was caught off guard by weird grammatical sentence structures but guess what...I didn't care...not at all because the storytelling that Winslow weaves is can't-put-it-down-brilliant.\u00a0I feel like I may have moved into gushing territory so let me try to sum up the gist of the story with one word....corruption. EVERYONE in this book is corrupt in one way or another and let me tell you...the police, the ADA's, the mayor, the defense lawyers, the criminals, the junkies, the wives, the church, even Internal Affairs...all dirty. \u00a0Boy does this make for some fascinating, suspense filled reading as you're never quite sure who's going to turn on who at any given point. You know from the prologue that things go wrong for Denny at some point but there's a whole lot of double crossing, killing, lying and cheating to get him there. \u00a0I should add a side note here: if you're offended by \u00a0graphic violence and language this isn't the book for you. I wanted to share some of the writing style with you and it took me awhile to find sections without the \"f\" word. Here's a great example of Denny and his thinking as he's meeting with a prosecutor to prep for his testimony in the trial of a violent drug dealer....\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'Just tell the truth and get the conviction\" Hinman said.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Which?\" Malone asked.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean?\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I mean\", Malone said, \"I can tell the truth or I can get the conviction. Which do you\u00a0want?\"\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\"Both,\" Hitman said.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\"You can't have both.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Because if he told the truth, they'd lose the case because Malone had no warrant and no probable cause to enter the apartment ...the dealer would walk. Because the real truth that they both know is that without cops \"testilying,\" the DA's office would hardly get any convictions at all. This doesn't bother Malone.Truth, justice and the American way.\u00a0The American way is, truth and justice maybe say hello in the hallway, send each other a Christmas card, but that's about the extent of their relationship.Accurate? We'll never know but Don Winslow spent years researching this book, interviewing hundreds of cops, rookies and veterans alike, so this kind of makes you say hmmm doesn't it? There's so much that's relevant and timely in this sprawling novel that you'll find yourself often shaking your head but there's one thing you won't be able to do and that's stop reading. Winslow expertly managed to keep me in the dark about how this cinematic thriller\u00a0would turn out and right up until the final few paragraphs I thought it might end the way I hoped. Surprise was on me. As I said Monday, if you like movies like The Town, The Firm, and The Untouchables and the tv show The Sopranos you'll LOVE this book. Now I'm off to continue casting the movie (March 1, 2019!) in my head...

Malone is detective in a New York City Special Task Force in North Manhattan. This is Malone's beat. His turf. His kingdom. The Task Force is just called The Force or \"da Force.\" The inner city backdrop is where the reader is transported into for this story. The place has almost a feudal feel. The lords of the inner city are the drug lords, organized crime, ethnic gangs and, of course, The Force. The Force is there to to keep the place from coming unglued.Malone and his crew get a new captain intent on stopping corruption and police brutality. Particularly, police brutality that is aimed at blacks. There is a heroin epidemic that the police are under pressure from the public to get in control. A new member is assigned to Malone's crew as a replacement to one of the detectives that was killed. Can the new guy be trusted? Is he there from Internal Affairs to find out Malone's shady way of upholding the law?This is a dark, angry look at inner city police work. Where corruption is a way of life. A place where right and wrong, loyalty and betrayal, love and honor all bleed together like watercolor paints on paper. It is about who has power over others.A good deal of social commentary comes through in the story.\nWhat the public at large doesn\u2019t understand is that the city\u2019s jails have become its de facto mental hospitals and detox centers.Just as there\u2019s no question that being a black cop is different, it just is, that\u2019s all. Other cops, except his brothers here, look at him a little different, and the \u201ccommunity\u201d\u2014as the social activists, bigmouthed ministers and local politicians laughably call the ghetto\u2014see him either as a potential ally who should help them out, or as a traitor. An Uncle Tom, an Oreo.\u201cNYU. Majored in criminal justice.\u201d \u201cYou might as well have majored in Bigfoot,\u201d Malone says. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Levin asks. \u201cBecause it don\u2019t exist, either\". \nThen there are the many characters and here are a few: Malone, the ethic Irish detective; Monty, the black detective; the Italian detective Russo; Levin, the new guy and is Jewish; Berger the cutthroat lawyer and Sykes the black police Captain and Malone's boss. Among others are the ghetto guys: Nasty Ass, Fat Freddy and \"Oh No Henry.\" Many other characters populate this rich lurid tale such as other cops, FBI, prosecutors and crime bosses. This is a long serious story and there were times when I had a tough time keeping myself vested. Most of the time though the writing, characters and plot twists kept me riveted to the story. Then I came across this jewel of a scene involving Wolfie the police dog. That scene had me laughing in stitches. I still laugh when I think about it.

Ultimately, it is a story of sergeant Denny Malone\u2019s descent into personal chaos and his eventual betrayal of friends, colleagues and family. Yet below the violence and corruption, Winslow allows us to see and feel Malone\u2019s humanity, compromised and sometimes confused but ultimately that of a man who only ever wanted (quoting the final five words of the novel) \u201cto be a good cop.\u201d It is a remarkable achievement.Many of the characters will stay with me for a long time, particularly Malone\u2019s close colleagues, Russo and Montague.

Unfortunately for me, I kinda hated this book. The problems start right from the first page, as Winslow writes in a grating tone that's both hyper-masculine and painfully melodramatic. Winslow is doing the third-person limited POV thing, where he adopts to perspective of his lead character. In this case, that character is an arrogant, corrupt, brutal police officer from Staten Island. The problem here is that Winslow is also intent on getting his own politics across to the reader as. plainly. as. possible. So when I read a detailed critique of the NRA or the prison-industrial complex, I'm pretty sure that's Winslow talking, not the thuggish protagonist. But when I read racist dismissals of Black Lives Matter and justifications for brutality, perjury, and 4th amendment violations, I have to assume that's the character talking and not Winslow. The resulting narrative confusion took me out of the story entirely. Not that there is much of a story to begin with. It's basically a jumble of tough guy cliches and subplots lifted from The Shield and The Wire with a truly bonkers third act twist tacked on for good measure. I believe our main characters are supposed to be conflicted and charismatic antiheroes, but mostly they come off as unpleasant assholes. Winslow's thesis, as it were, is that most cops genuinely do want to protect and serve, but they are ruined by the war on drugs and the overwhelming culture of corruption surrounding them. I'd be more inclined to agree with this thesis if his cop characters weren't so miserable to listen to for 400 pages. 2 stars instead of 1 because Winslow seems like a good dude, and because he deserves some credit for trying to earnestly address issues of racism and police brutality inside a mainstream cop novel."}], "description": "The acclaimed, award-winning, bestselling author of The Cartel\u2014voted one of the Best Books of the Year by more than sixty publications, including the New York Times\u2014makes his William Morrow debut with a cinematic epic as explosive, powerful, and unforgettable as Mystic River and The Wire.Our ends know our beginnings, but the reverse isn\u2019t true . . .All Denny Malone wants is to be a good cop.He is \"the King of Manhattan North,\" a highly decorated NYPD detective sergeant and the real leader of \"Da Force.\" Malone and his crew are the smartest, the toughest, the quickest, the bravest, and the baddest, an elite special unit given carte blanche to fight gangs, drugs, and guns. Every day and every night for the eighteen years he\u2019s spent on the Job, Malone has served on the front lines, witnessing the hurt, the dead, the victims, the perps. He\u2019s done whatever it takes to serve and protect in a city built by ambition and corruption, where no one is clean\u2014including Malone himself.What only a few know is that Denny Malone is dirty: he and his partners have stolen millions of dollars in drugs and cash in the wake of the biggest heroin bust in the city\u2019s history. Now Malone is caught in a trap and being squeezed by the Feds, and he must walk the thin line between betraying his brothers and partners, the Job, his family, and the woman he loves, trying to survive, body and soul, while the city teeters on the brink of a racial conflagration that could destroy them all.This is the great cop novel of our time and a book only Don Winslow could write: a haunting story of greed and violence, inequality and race, crime and injustice, retribution and redemption that reveals the seemingly insurmountable tensions between the police and the diverse citizens they serve. A searing portrait of a city on the edge and of a courageous, heroic, and deeply flawed man who stands at the edge of its abyss, The Force is a masterpiece of urban realism full of shocking and surprising twists, leavened by flashes of dark humor, a morally complex and utterly riveting dissection of modern American society and the controversial issues confronting us today.", "title": "The Force", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075859-the-force", "average": 4.11, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1487222482l/32075859.jpg", "reviews": 1392, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/37795.Don_Winslow", "name": "Don Winslow"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075859-the-force", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35399209-corruzione", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33607386-the-force", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33140147-the-force", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36302999-corrup-o", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33026983-the-force", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206236.The_Power_of_the_Dog", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23602561-the-cartel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8008928-savages", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164760.The_Winter_of_Frankie_Machine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13544841-the-kings-of-cool", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
