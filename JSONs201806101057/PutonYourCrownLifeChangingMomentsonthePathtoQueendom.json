I've always liked the image that Queen Latifah portrays of herself and have liked her in any shows or movies I've seen her in. She definitely has an aura of girl-power, so I was excited to read some tips from her on self-esteem.Queen Latifah holds nothing back, she divulges private information (as well as her private feelngs) about situations like her brother's death and even her brief time as a broke celebrity. It takes a strong person to talk about things like this so publicly and in doing so, she's showing the reader that she \"practices what she preaches.\"Two parts of the book stood out as my favorites. First, the section on beauty, which celebrates the beauty of all shapes, sizes, and colors. I also loved the section about Queen Latifah's mother, who seems like such a strong woman. Queen Latifah's love for her mother is evident in every word spoken about her and she even gives her a few pages to write her own thoughts and guidance.Some of the sections didn't interest me all that much, Queen Latifah is a bit of a daredevil, so I didn't quite connect with her cliff diving and motorcycle analogies to conquering fear.This book is a short read and packs a lot of inspiration in a small amount of pages. I think my favorite mantra that I've taken from the book is on page 157:\"You have to hold your head up and look at the horizon, because if you don't, if you keep gazing down at the ground, your crown's gonna fall right off.\"I recommend this book to fans of Queen Latifah because you can really tell she's writing from her soul and sharing her own private experiences and feelings to help and inspire others.I received this book for review from Hachette Books.reviewed for http://inthehammockblog.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Edel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2198142-edel", "userReview": "First you should know I really enjoy all of Queen Latifah's movies. I picked this audio book up in the hope of getting to know the woman behind the actress , and it did not disappoint. Dana Owens (Queen Latifah)is quite the woman!!As you get to know her ,and her family in this book you see she gained a lot of her sensible attitude and sunny disposition from her family, esp her mother ,brother and father. Her mother,Mama Owens, was a teacher who went above and beyond for her students,my favourite parts of the book were when Dana talked about her and her relationship with her. We get to hear a lot about the good parts in her life , but she does not shy away from the sadder moments like when her brother died in an accident. Her description of that moment almost broke my heart , I could feel a tear running down my face reading that and hearing the pain in her voice. Throughout the book one thing stands out, her sunny attitude to life!!This woman had problems in her life with friends , money etc but she remains optimistic and a happy soul and it did me a world of good listening to her and helped me to remember to take a moment to live in the moment ."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7950608-lori", "userReview": "This is a bit memoir and part advice book. Queen Latifah -aka- Dana Owens. writes a nice helpful book about her life and what she has learned. She shares tidbits about her life, the ups and downs that have happened to her. such as the loss of her beloved brother, \"Winki\" who was killed in a motorcycle accident. this left her devastated and angry. the success she has had with her career but also the period of time she went broke and lost a lot of that money. She shares with us her religious belief.her closeness she has with her mother that she gives a lot of credit for what she has learned for her mother.

Blige was crowed the Queen of Hip Hop Soul...there was our original queen of entertainment: Queen Latifah.With the summer 2010 release of her book \"Put on Your Crown: Life-Changing Moments on the Path to Queendom,\" Queen Latifah easily entered another area of entertainment, by penning her life story and getting comfortable in the world of publishing.And rightfully so. She has excelled at essentially every other area she's touched, since we were first introduced to her in 1998.Because Dana Elaine Owens is in the media and relevant all the time, it's easy to overlook her contribution to urban entertainment, and now mainstream pop culture.Of course we remember her best for her 1989 album \"All Hail the Queen\" and the way she would command the stage, decked out in Afro-centric attire, rapping hard, and at the same time embracing her femininity. She made sure to tell you what you could and could not call her...she reminded us as young girls that we should stand tall in who we were: \"who you callin' a bitch?\" was a classic female hip hop lyric that spoke volumes.And somehow in the span of her almost 25 year career, we haven't even had the chance to see how smoothly Latifah went from a New Jersey rapper to an Academy Award nominated entertainment icon.Now along with her Grammy, she also has a Golden Globe and a SAG award. She has Emmy nominations, and she's an easy go-to-girl to host shows from the BET Awards to the People's Choice Awards. Latifah is loveable, dependable, and she's proven to be a consummate entertainer, on all fronts.Her book \"Put on Your Crown\" chronicles her journey from a young girl in New Jersey, up to the present time. While it's neither a detailed autobiography nor a specific self-help book, it's kind of a combination of the two genres. She tells her story, and throws in words of advice and inspiration along the way.I enjoyed reading her first-person accounts of many of the memorable moments in her life, good and bad. From when she received a star right next to Michael Jackson's on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, to when her brother Winki was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident in 1992.Greatly influenced by her mother Rita, Latifah shares many of the lessons she learned as a result of great parenting (despite her parents divorce at age 10), and as a result of maintaining self-esteem regardless of her circumstances, appearance, or expectations around her.At age 40, you still get the impression that there is so much more to see from Queen Latifah. And while it's obvious that she's already done so much in her career, it's actually pretty rare that the viewing audience has yet to tire of her.In fact, as I was finishing up the book in the elevator today, an elderly (like really elderly) yet nosy/fass neighbour was staring at my book cover, and smiling. \"Oh, I really like her,\" she said to me, pointing at the cover of my book. And I had to agree: EVERYBODY likes Queen Latifah. It's official.Admittedly, sometimes I get annoyed to discover that everyone and their mother also has a book. Literally. As a writer, you can't help but become jaded when Snooki from Jersey Shore, Paris Hilton, the Kardashians, and every other person making over a million is given a lucrative publishing deal and churns out a full-length book in a matter of month.But I digress.Something can be said for having an interesting life experience, and apparently readers will always pick up a copy of \"literature\" as long as it's written by a famililar face. This is one of the \"celebrity\" books that I really and truly can't be cynical about. It is what it is: a legendary female figure telling her story. And my ability to whiz through this book showed me that Latifah did a good job telling it.There's nothing groundbreaking on the pages. Most of it we already know. We know about the fabulous movies (Last Holiday and Bringing Down the House were my personal favourites), and the hit songs and hip hop classic albums. We know about the Flavor Unit, and her sidekick from time, Shakim.I was kinda wondering if she'd finally drop some bombs about her often-questioned sexuality. Latifah's been rumoured to date her personal trainer Jeanette Jenkins, whom she also reportedly bought a house with...but the rumours will remain that, as she often addresses previous boyfriends in the book and regrets for not having children earlier in life...but Latifah totally stays away from the topic of present-time relationships, or even the fact that her sexuality has always been a hot topic (especially after that role in Set if Off that we remember her playing all too well in 1996).She went broke in 2000, despite her fame. She was molested at age 5 by a neighbour. There were a few things I didn't really know much about...but again, there was no juicy gossip, just lots of sugary sweet words of encouragement:\"We all need people to help us and lift us up. and other people need our help. When you put that together, you can create something really powerful.\"\"You make your own oppotunities.\"\"You have to be constantly improving yourself.\"\"We can rise up only when we stand on the shoulders of those who went before us.\"\"Whatever your religion or belief system, the key is to have an active inner life that radiates through all your actions...\"Nothing exceptionally unique or \"deep,\" but definitely taken to heart, given the source it's coming from, and the context it's written in.But I liked the level of detail that was introduced. For example, I loved to know that her bond with her business partner Shakim is so deep that he actually jumped in front of her to protect her from danger/bullets when an event they were at went awry.It was endearing to read how she often escaped the madness of her ultra-busy schedule to sit next to her brother's grave and speak to him for hours on end. Moreso, to learn that the scar on her forehead that she refuses to cover with makeup or airbrush, despite suggestion, was a scar she received at age 3 while playing tag with her brother.And again, I'm fascinated by \"celebrity\" life because at its core there is always a regular ol' individual trying to make it, who has the faith, determination--and if they're as lucky as Latifah--the support of family and grounded friends to help build those dreams and fantasies into an easy reality.Yes, there were downfalls in her professional journey as well. I don't know about you, but I definitely didn't buy her 2004 jazz CD \"The Dana Owens Album.\" I also didn't watch her daytime talk show from 1999-2001. Like any career, there were definitely some misses...but it's safe to say that overall, Latifah's had an awesome career...up to here.And while she came on to the scene as a dope female MC, I think her true legacy will be being able to capture the screen, and make us laugh through her television and film roles. Living Single was a staple TV show while growing up in the 90s, her roles in House Party 2, Juice, and Jungle Fever, are roles we're all familiar with. I love her comedic relief in my favourite movie, Brown Sugar.So this rapper-turned-actress-turned-Cover Girl is still, and will always remain, a true Queen on so many fronts. She has personified elegance, grace, and just genuine congeniality. It's hard to NOT like this woman.Keep givin' it to 'em, Queen!\"Take the time to check in with yourself, regularly. Don't lose yourself.\" ~Queen Latifah"}, {"userName": "Jenny Karraker", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9521703-jenny-karraker", "userReview": "I was feeling sorry for myself one day at the library so thought maybe Queen Latifah might have something to say to me. Being a mother of 4 daughters, her mother's life spoke to me more so than the author's. I was struck by the dedication of her mother who got 3 jobs and went back to school when her husband left when QL was 9. Her determination not to stay in the projects but to move through them impressed me of someone whose isn't basing their ID on outward things but inward character. Her mother's continued dedication and perseverance in teaching at a rough urban school helping troubled young people discover their true selves encouraged me to speak firmly into the lives of those around me. QL did have some great thoughts. Accumulating personal wealth isn't about stuff, but about empowerment (having the tools to do the things you want to do). In the area of success, connect w others who will bring out the best in you. Beauty isn't about perfection. It's those little flaws that make you the real person that you are. Fear cripples and prevents you from doing the things you most want to do; don't over analyze--just do it. QL lost her brother in a motorcycle accident shortly after he'd settled into a career as a policeman and begun to think of having a family. Guilt accompanied the pain, for she had given him the bike. Though you learn to deal w the pain and move on, you never get over it. Though others can't understand your pain, it helps you understand theirs. In the area is strength, QL urges us to dare to disappoint others by following our dreams and sticking to our values vs. caving into pleasing others. I enjoyed this book and hope that no one thinks I'm disrespecting the author by using initials for her name--it's just shorter!She seems to have an inner resilience that I don't think others can artificially reproduce, but hopefully her words will inspire younger girls to persevere and make the most out if their lives."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1550301-carol", "userReview": "This was light reading as far as self improvement books go, but the book contained a lot of common sense written in plain language.

What I can saw is I was slapping myself for waiting too long to read it and waiting even longer to put on my bookshelf. From her rap career, films, talk show, Cover Girl contact, acceptance of her size and the love that she has always expressed to her family and friends....I've followed her career. She has always been authentic. She has never given excuses or been pretentious about her arrival on the scene.Put On Your Crown is a simple straightforward piece of work that is about accepting who you are.....working with what you have....and going for what you want. It's about acknowledging and understanding that there will be challenges and that there will be doors opened and closed, successes and failures....but....you have the right stuff to have success...positive self-esteem...amazing confidence...an indelible spirit....and mountaintop experiences....if you believe in you and what you bring to the table. No need to be apologetic.Put On Your Crown drops nuggets to young girls as well as women. It highlights situations that everyone can relate to and it causes you to pause and reflect on situations in your life....how you may have responded...how you can change the way you deal with the elephant in the room...and how everyone that you come in contact with...can help or hinder. The chapters focus on real issues/issues we wrestle with: success, beauty, money, love, loss, strength, fear and joy.It's not written for the faint. As I said, she offered no apologies for her reign. Neither should we offer any excuses for ours. Yep, we reign supreme. As the queen pinpoints \" life has given us all opportunities for a number of incredible experiences. We can and have become distracted far too many times by comparing ourselves to others....defining ourselves in the manner that others have or have attempted. We must take the 'life stopping life changing' opportunities for what they are.\" Putting On Our Crowns means we have arrived at a healthy destination......a destination of self love (no more superficiality). Note: Get the book. Gift it to your favorite girl!

The basic ideas of the book are love yourself for who you are, take time to care for yourself first, and love the people around you for who they are. I've always liked Queen Latifah. She's always seemed to me to be fairly grounded. I think my favorite thing about this book is that she proves to the reader that she's just a normal person. She makes mistakes, she's not perfect, and she realizes that. I think she's a great role model. (Side note I LOVE her fashion sense. I have for a while, but my love for her eye was solidified when I read How to Never Look Fat Again and it says something to the effect that if you're a plus size woman dress like Queen Latifah, she knows what she's doing.) I've been going through some tough times mentally in the last year or so and reading this book did help me. While it's mostly stuff I already knew (like I said it's geared for young women, and I have left that arena a bit ago) it was information that I needed to remind myself. Somehow reading that \"The Queen\" was and had been going through some of the same things really helped me find the strength I needed to kick my own butt and get myself back on track again. If you're having some self doubt, about anything in your life pick this one up. If you know a young woman pass it along. It can't hurt to try and teach a young woman the lessons we've all had to learn the hard way! It also could be beneficial for some young men. It's written for a woman, but I think the lessons are great for men or women.A review copy of this book was provided by the publisher.

Don't ask me; I don't know why. It was what I loved and connected with. And I saw something I had never seen before: a big woman (Kadijah) getting asked out on dates, being attractive to men, assuming that attractive men would find her attractive. And I fell in love with Queen Latifah watching those episodes. This book continues her legacy of being a woman who does everything well. She's a musical artist, actress, beauty icon, producer, and all-round beautiful person. The straight and humble honesty of this book was exactly the tone I needed. It's very simply written, and is less a biography (though she shares her own struggles) and more a pep talk for young women. There's nothing ground breaking in here, but that's kind of refreshing. It's a good reminder of what it takes to be a healthy, good person, and what one of the most famous people alive today went through to realize basic principles of ethics, money management, relationships, addiction, and self image. It's one of the most body positive things I've read.Yes, the simplistic tone gets a bit old, but then the book isn't that long, so I had not fully tired of it to the point of putting it down. Also, I didn't connect with Queen Latifah's deeply religious commitment, or her traditional assumptions about gender and what it means to be a lady. But even these things were framed with a humility and a \"you do you so long as you is kind\" sort of tone that made me embrace even these elements.This is a good refresher for the mind. A good return to basic principles, and a spiritually encouraging journey. I definitely recommend for the young women out there who may be feeling the world is against them. Queen Latifah has a no-nonsense way of bringing out the beautiful.

It is moments that Queen Latifah wants to share with all women and girls in her book Put On Your Crown. Queen Latifah makes it clear she never set out to be a role model, that is too great a responsibility for anyone, rather she was sickened to hear the statistics of women and girls who suffer from low-self esteem. Put On Your Crown is an authentic no nonsense look at moments that can change a person's life or thought process. This is not a book that tells one how to behave, as each person must listen to their own inner queen and follow their own path, rather this book speaks of the moments, those times we often ignore while we are too busy caught up in what could have been or what will be. Queen Latifah makes it quite clear that not all of these crucial moments will be positive ones, but moments to learn from all the same. In Put On Your Crown, Queen Latifah shares pivotal moments in her life and extrapolates those moments to moments we each could be experiencing in our own lives. Queen Latifah speaks directly to the reader in a pure, honest and direct voice, so listen up, Put On Your Crown is one book that should be read by women of all ages."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3749762-jennifer", "userReview": "Our society is littered with women that are plagued with low self-esteem.

Well, you won\u2019t find that nonsense here. In \u201cPut On Your Crown,\u201d Queen Latifah shares moments of her life with us that make her who and what she stands for today.In less than two hundred pages, the Queen gives words of encouragement and advice in a plethora of categories. For example, \u201cBeauty-Diversity is beauty. Women come in all shapes and sizes.\u201d It\u2019s common knowledge that we are all very different but she takes beauty one-step further. After she became a model/spokeswoman for Cover Girl, her mission became one to inspire all women and help them see that if she could be a Cover Girl, so could they.Overall, Queen Latifah\u2019s use of her personal life and experiences blended well with her advice. She definitely put her heart and soul into each and every page. I highly recommend \u201cPut On Your Crown\u201d to women of all ages.

I am not that audience. I love autobiographies and memoirs. This had elements of those genres, but it was more a book to empower young women. And that's fantastic. But as a 35 year old man who's read a ton of self help books, there wasn't much in there for me that I didn't already know. I believe this book is a fantastic read for younger people (particularly women, but anyone can gleam knowledge from it) or people who have not read much in the self help/motivation genre.Had I read this a few years ago, I think it would have been more impactful.I am a fan of Queen Latifah's music and movies. And she did talk about parts of her life involving those things that I really enjoyed. She's clearly an intelligent, motivated, ass kicking, humble, positive role model for anyone who wants to be the best version of themselves. Love that this book exists.

She tells the reader things that have happened to her in life and how she's overcome them or learned from them. What her biggest message was I think is to be true to yourself, love yourself, love the life you live. I guess I always imagined her as a goody-goody type of person, but it turns out that she smokes (and tries to stop) and often drinks to much and experimented with drugs and sex when she was a teen. But she's really close to her family and friends and sounds like a great person to know.To me, nothing in this book was super life changing, but it was still an interesting read, so if you are a fan of hers, check it out.I liked when she said to keep your head up otherwise your crown will fall off.

Queen Latifah lets us into the dark corners of her life, from living in the projects to having no money even after she had achieved greatness in her musical career to the death of her beloved brother. She also tells us of the joys in her life and reminds us that the joys are the things we need to hold on to. While the book is aimed at females, men can benefit from reading it as well.

She certainly has earned the right to be proud of her achievements, and her \"girl from the projects makes good\" story is encouraging. It was just a little hard to identify with all her jet-setting ways. So her path to Queendom won't be the same as mine, I fear. I think I might have enjoyed the book more if it had been presented as more of a memoir than a self-help book."}, {"userName": "Bunny", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1519823-bunny", "userReview": "Beautiful. Just a really, really beautiful book. This is both an autobiography (albeit, a blessedly short one) and a self empowerment book. If the self empowerment section had been written by anyone else, I don't think I would've enjoyed it nearly as much. But because she puts so much of herself into this, you feel you really know her. She explains where she's coming from with the advice, and it's incredibly moving and beautifully told. She also made me cry a few times. Especially the chapter she handed over to her mother. These are both strong, beautiful women, and they really do make you want to be strong and make them proud.Beautiful. I just really, really liked this book. I would like to own it."}, {"userName": "Britni ", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2201460-britni", "userReview": "This book by Queen Latifah was an inspiring, quick read. I did notice some repetition in stories throughout the book, though, which made the reading slow from the middle until the end. There are eight chapters with different themes like love, fear, and strength. She talks a lot about her own life experiences, and she draws on her relationships with her mother, father, and her business partner Shakim. If you like Queen Latifah and want a quick pick-me-up I would recommend it.This book review was possible because Hachette Book Group gave me a free copy through the Goodreads book giveaway."}, {"userName": "Holly Booms Walsh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137564-holly-booms-walsh", "userReview": "I adore Queen Latifah and think she is a good role model, so I was interested to see her book on the library shelf. The book itself is full of positive messages about being true to yourself and respecting yourself and daring to go outside your comfort zone. She also shares some darker times in her own life and lessons learned from coping with depression, abuse, financial stress, and death, which I respected. Her books is warm and conversational, with a lovely section written by her mother. It comes off as a little saccharine and glossily upbeat, but it means well. I think it is aimed at a younger audience, and would be a nice addition to any girl's bookshelf."}, {"userName": "OOSA ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1411473-oosa", "userReview": "Moments Queen Latifah\u2019s \u201cPut On Your Crown - Life Changing Moments on the Path to Queendom\u201d is an impressive read geared towards young ladies.

A book that would show them they are strong and can do anything.And she did that.She delivers an in-your-face, but in a good way, approach to all the important subjects that make up our core as beings.I have to add, although this is not a memoir, I learned a lot about her and what she stands for. I had known enough already, from media, but she fills the gaps about things I always wondered like where'd she get that scar on her forehead?Women will enjoy this read, fan or not, you soon will be."}, {"userName": "African Americans on the Move Book Club", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1284200-african-americans-on-the-move-book-club", "userReview": "We all know and love Queen latifah from inspiring lyrics, funny movies, and ground breaking work in front of and behind the camera.

She is a nice, talented woman and comes across as someone it would be pleasant to know. She tries in this book to give insight into how women out to live in order to be (not her word) self-actualized. This book was very slim. She gives a little information on events in her life that taught her things, but not much detail. She's straightforward but not forthcoming. So, unfortunately, it seemed like she was just dealing in platitudes a lot of the time, because the book wasn't quite personal enough to overcome a bit of a generic feeling."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1253027-brenda", "userReview": "I just love Queen Latifah! This book is a collection of wisdom and encouragement for younger women, mostly told through stories from her own life. She talks openly about her family, her rise to fame, career strategy, and the role faith has played in her life. I didn't know that her brother died tragically a few years back, and her observations about grief are spot on. If you're already a fan, you'll really enjoy this, but I think everyone can get something out of it! It's not long, either - I finished it in a couple of hours."}, {"userName": "Lorrea - WhatChaReadin'?", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7471412-lorrea---whatchareadin", "userReview": "This is a very simple yet effective book to read. I wouldn't say that it necessarily inspired me, but it made me more aware. Of myself and of others around me. I like that this book is not preachy and is not do what I and things will get better. It lays down Queen Latifah's life and what obstacles she came up against and how she made it over those hurdles. Everyone's experience isn't going to be like hers but we can all relate on some level. I would recommend this book to young girls and young women. It is a good book to make you feel good about being a woman and being yourself."}], "description": "Modeled after Maria Shriver's Just Who Will You Be, Queen Latifah's goal with Put On Your Crown is to help young women build a strong sense of self-esteem.
