Ist dies die Welt?\u201d (Kl\u00e4rchen)Egmont\u2019s passionate lover Kl\u00e4rchen shouts out her frustration at the mediocrity, cowardice and lack of reliability in the world, consisting of people who are lukewarm in their commitments, and want convenience rather than passionate love and freedom of thought. \u201cIs this the world?\u201dKl\u00e4rchen, a female mirror of the proud, free spirit Egmont, can\u2019t understand the political side of society, just like her lover, whose honest joie de vivre costs him his life. Caution, political thought, planning and manipulating are not his qualities, even in the face of disaster. He is free, he enjoys his life, and wants others to enjoy theirs as well. A truly tolerant soul, as long as no one takes his freedom away from him:\u201cEr will mein Leben und mein Gl\u00fcck, und f\u00fchlt nicht, dass der schon tot ist, der um seiner Sicherheit willen lebt!\u201dIf you only live to secure your safety tomorrow, Egmont argues, you are already dead today. But he can\u2019t ignore the fact that political life around him takes a different stand. Set in the era of rebellion against Spanish rule in the Netherlands and Belgium, and of clashes between different Christian faiths, Egmont\u2019s call for liberty of the individual is weak compared to the powers whose interests are at stake. His friend and rival Wilhelm von Oranien represents the cautious, long-term approach which will ultimately be more successful.\u201cEgmont\u201d is a display of strong, yet different personalities in politically troubled societies. It is a play raising the question if you are willing to sacrifice your ideals to fit into the world, how much you are willing to fight for your freedom of choice, and how much honesty is possible in a delicate diplomatic situation. Goethe, always passionate artist and careful scholar in one person, does not offer a definite answer. He rather shows that these different personalities exist in all layers of society, and in all religious communities. If Kl\u00e4rchen and Egmont stand for absolute freedom to live your life according to your pleasure and happiness, Wilhelm von Oranien symbolises political intelligence in his actions towards Spanish power. Alba, on the other hand, takes on the role of executor, of hardliner in the name of society, while his son Ferdinand identifies with the character of Egmont, and breaks in a similar way, in the face of his father\u2019s definition of political power, which makes him choke and lose his idealistic, passionate love of life. \u201cIs this the world?\u201dFerdinand\u2019s despair echoes Vonnegut\u2019s character Proteus in Player Piano, living within a powerful corporate framework, but feeling the emptiness and meaninglessness of a purely ritualistic privilege. Joining the rebellious forces without hope, except for the mark in the historical records, Proteus\u2019 fate is similar to Egmont\u2019s or Kl\u00e4rchen\u2019s or Ferdinand\u2019s, it is in fact shared with rebellious people in oppressive communities around the world. This is the world, and it goes on, as Vonnegut puts it in Player Piano, even beyond Judgment Day. Checking the historical facts around the Egmont drama, the contemporary reader will see that it rings true there as well. The record of his execution had consequences, long-term.You can kill the spirit of freedom temporarily, but not forever!"}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "\u062f\u0631 \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0698\u062f\u06cc \u00ab\u0627\u06af\u0645\u0648\u0646\u062a\u00bb \u062f\u0631 \u0644\u062d\u0638\u0647\u00ad\u0627\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u00ab\u0627\u06af\u0645\u0648\u0646\u062a\u00bb \u062f\u0631 \u0646\u06cc\u0645\u00ad\u0634\u0628 \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0639\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u062e\u0648\u062f\u060c \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u06cc\u00ad\u0631\u0648\u062f\u060c \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0631 \u0632\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u0647\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u00ad\u0634\u06a9\u0627\u0641\u062f\u060c \u0648 \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0641\u0631\u0634\u062a\u0647\u00ad\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0647\u00ad\u06cc \u0622\u0628\u06cc \u0631\u0646\u06af \u0622\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u060c \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0637\u0631\u0627\u0641\u0634 \u0631\u0627 \u0631\u0648\u0634\u0646\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u0627\u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647\u060c \u0628\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u0627\u062f\u0647\u060c \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0647\u06cc\u06a9\u0644 \u0631\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\u060c \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0686\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u0648 \u0632\u06cc\u0628\u0627\u0626\u06cc \u00ab\u06a9\u0644\u0631\u0634\u0646\u00bb \u0645\u0639\u0634\u0648\u0642\u0647 \u0627\u06af\u0645\u0648\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0645 \u0632\u0647\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u062f\u06a9\u0634\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u0648\u062f\u060c \u0627\u0648 \u0634\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u00ad\u06a9\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0648 \u0628\u0627 \u0627\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0634\u0648\u0642\u00ad\u0622\u0645\u06cc\u0632\u060c \u0628\u0633\u062a\u0647\u00ad\u06cc \u062a\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0648 \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u00ad\u062f\u0647\u062f\u060c \u0633\u067e\u0633 \u0686\u0648\u0628\u06cc \u0648 \u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0647\u06cc\u060c \u0648 ...\u060c \u0646\u06cc\u0632 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0645\u0647 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u06af\u0645\u0646\u062a\u060c \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0622\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u06a9\u062a\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631 \u0647\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u0627\u0631\u060c \u0628\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0648 \u0646\u0634\u0631 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 1334"}, {"userName": "Heather Parks", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6297316-heather-parks", "userReview": "All the action is in the final Act. Egmont is an interesting tale, made slightly bizarre by Goethe's obsession with suicide and death. Though it's a tragedy, our hero meets his end bravely and victoriously. While the characters of Egmont, Clara, and the Duke seem to fit the usual archetypes, the most fascinating characters are that of Brackenburg and Ferdinand. As typical of Goethe, the language is beautiful and evocative. The best way to enjoy the story is to listen to Beethoven's incidental music written for the play and try to read it through his perspective. One of the major themes oh Egmont is unjust imprisonment and Beethoven made it clear in his lifetime that he felt isolated and imprisoned by his hearing loss. Just as Egmont accepts his fate, Beethoven would eventually accept his deafness as the will of God. This was also the attitude of the hero Florestan in Fidelio. There are other similarities between Egmont and Beethoven's opera 'Fidelio' including themes of heroism, self sacrifice, rising against tyranny, class issues, female courage and love's loyalty. Beethoven would also have appreciated the allusions to nature and would have related to several characters. To me, it is fascinating to draw the parallels between the composer and the writings of Goethe, whom he adored."}, {"userName": "Andreea In Bookland", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19972166-andreea-in-bookland", "userReview": "I loved every page of the book and I may or may not have lost a couple of tears at the end....."}, {"userName": "Pandabooks", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34427878-pandabooks", "userReview": "I got a game of thrones vibe.

Egmont is far from being short listed as a major work, at least by this \u201creviewer\u201d. I guess that is all I have to say about Egmont per se, the rest is what the play made me think of.Faust is included with another ninety nine works among the best that human beings have ever created. I know I have read through Faust, when I was about eighteen, I know the subject and it is very meaningful and to an atheist like I used to be, it may even sound enticing:Sell your soul to the Devil and you made it- you get all the benefits and lose something immaterial, without substance, which most of the people seldom acknowledge. And then the devil might not exist. In the new religion I am cooking, the Devil may play no part at all, even if one of the major precepts will be to accept all the major, peaceful faiths. In other words, you are Christian\u2026that\u2019s fine; we have no quarrel with you and so on.Pointy two, or somewhere up front; we take all the positive traits: serenity, compassion, empathy from Buddhism\u2026perhaps without the reincarnation, which I am not sure if it does occur.Point three- Positive psychology has proved that being religious help you get a longer, healthier and happier life. Stretching this point a bit, or very much: we need religion to get the Holy Grail and, indeed miracles are for real: you believe in God and His unlimited powers and\u2026bingo, you made it, Heaven on earth.I am not sure about the role of Mephisto, but this reminds me of something that took place in an American TV series, recounted by Tal Ben-Shahar: here in the version that I remember\u201cThis bad guy, from the mob, dies and finds himself in a gorgeous place, where a nice looking figure asks him:-\tWhat do you want?-\tWhat do you mean?-\tYou can ask for anything-\tWell I want food, wine, entertainment, massage\u2026-\tYou can have it allThe dead mobster indulges in hedonic pleasure, but after a while he is bored. He asks for the \u201cAngel\u201d:-\they , I am bored-\tWell, you had all you wanted-\tYes, but I want something to do, some work-\tYou can have it all, except the chance to make an effort for it-\tI want to go to the \u201cother\u201d place then \u2013and he is thinking, better hell than this boredom-\tThis is the other place\u2026and a devious smile appears on the phony angel\u2019s face\u2026Mephistopheles can appear in various guises.I know only about sixteen words in German, without einz, zwei\u2026. Raus, Ich liebe dich, zimmer\u2026But mysteriously, I have learned from somewhere \u2013\u201cDas Ewig Weibliche\u201d. In the Romanian translation it was something like the feminine eternal will take us to the sublime heights.This was a line I have started to use in my efforts to win the attention of girls, and, sometimes it worked. It is a paradox to have such a strong feeling that Germans are cold and to use a German, of all languages text, to try and warm and win over hearts.Well, thank you Goethe.www.realini.blogspot.ro"}, {"userName": "WaitingToFade", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31111844-waitingtofade", "userReview": "This is a review of an older edition of the play that has no ISBN, translated by Arthur Duke Coleridge, M.A.This was the first play I'd read from Goethe (I know...I need to get into the boat already!), and it was very enjoyable. It wasn't required reading, but I first encountered it from a course I'm taking this month, and I told myself that I needed to read it. And I'm glad I did. It is inspiring to see that people have been fighting, dying, and living, for freedom from the beginning of the human race. Egmont's metaphor comparing people to horses in the fourth act is beautiful:\"It is an easy matter for the shepherd to drive a whole flock of sheep before him: the ox draws the plough unresistingly; but as for the noble horse, that you would ride, you must inform yourself of his thoughts and ways, and demand of him nothing unreasonable, nor unreasonably. For this reason the citizen desires to retain his ancient constitution, and to be governed by his own countrymen, because he knows how he is guided, because he may expect from them unselfishness and sympathy in his fate and fortunes.\"Egmont tells the Duke of Alva that in order to rule over a people fairly, the ruler must work WITH the people, because people have their own wills. But after their conversation ends, it is revealed that the Duke had called him there only to get evidence of him saying treasonous things in order to arrest and execute him. In prison, Egmont meets the Duke's son, Ferdinand, who had assisted in father in orchestrating this plan, for the first time. Ferdinand is remorseful and wishes he could take it all back. What Egmont tells him in the fifth act is also beautiful:\"You lose me not. If my life was a mirror, where you saw yourself reflected so gladly, so also let my death be! Men are not together only, when with each other; the distant and the departed as well live for us. I have lived enough for myself, I shall live for you. My daily life has been a joyful one; I have done my duty every day promptly, as my conscience dictated to me. Now my life ends...I shall cease to live, but I have lived. So should you, my friend, love your life, and fear not death!\"Often, when I hear about events that happened in history, it always sounds like dry facts. But plays and other narratives such as \"Egmont\" that recount these events can bring them to life, reminding me that these were human beings--like myself--that had to go through these things. They ate, drank, had fun, worked hard, were happy, miserable, angry, jealous, and had hopes, dreams, and desires. I think everybody should read Goethe's \"Egmont,\" and I will definitely read some of Goethe's other stuff, such as \"Faust.\"3.5/5 stars"}, {"userName": "Gabriella Gricius", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1848040-gabriella-gricius", "userReview": "Why Read: I honestly do not have a good answer when it comes to stating why I read Egmont. On a normal basis, I don\u2019t read plays. I also do not usually read books that were written in the 1700s. But there\u2019s a first time for everything, and if it at all matters- I\u2019m glad I began with Egmont. Review: It was the first play I had read in a long time, Egmont. It will not be the last play I read. I think it surprised me how much I enjoyed it. The old speak, and the dialogue that goes on for a page and a half \u2013 the monologues! There is so much to love about older plays, the ones that take their time in finding the plot and uncovering the scheme. Egmont was 5 acts, but rather short.If I had to choose a favorite character, it would probably be Egmont\u2019s friend \u2013 William of Orange. Basically the only smart character in this whole play, he has this earnestness about him that is infectious. Egmont is written in the time of the Spanish Inquisition and how a town in the Netherlands was chosen to be the first to see their rights taken away piece by piece.The interlocking tales, whether it be Egmont\u2019s capture and his lover Clara, the Regents\u2019 fear, Alva and his quick takeover, or the peasants who had such loyalty to the crown, created this fantastic environmental-like effect that led me to treat it more as a novel than a book. As with any book really though, there were issues I took with it. Egmont is old-fashioned, so many of the jokes or not-jokes that they stated were lost on me. I know that is no fault of the play itself, but really the whole situation of the play was difficult to follow. Without the blurb at the beginning (which I\u2019m not entirely sure was a part of the play or added on the part of the Gutenberg Project), I would not have been entirely certain what I was reading about \u2013 which is always an issue.However, despite that \u2013 Egmont was fun. Really. It\u2019s a great read for anyone looking into reading a play that is quite short but entertaining to say the least.

Beethoven was inspired to compose a symphonic score for the work. Stefan Zweig in the \"World of Yesterday\" described it as a masterpiece. Unfortunately, Egmont's charms are essentially absent when rendered into English prose.First performed in 1789, the work clearly belongs to the revolutionary era as the hero Egmont, a Flemish General, is executed by the Spaniard Duke of Alba, because of his vocal defense of the rights of the local nobility and burghers in the Spanish Netherlands. Egmont's martyrdom will set off a successful revolt led by William of Orange.Unfortunately none of his works very well in translation. The final scene in which the condemned Egmont sees a vision of the triumphant Goddess liberty is particularly ghastly.

His works span the fields of poetry, drama, literature, theology, humanism, and science. His Magnum Opus, lauded as one of the peaks of world literature, is the two-part dramatic poem Faust: A Tragedy. He was one of the key figures of German literature and the movement of Weimar Classicism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; this movement coincides with Enlightenment, Sentimentality (Empfindsamkeit), Sturm und Drang, and Romanticism. His scientific text Theory of Colours influenced Darwin with its focus on plant morphology. His influence on German philosophy is virtually immeasurable, having major impact especially on the generation of Hegel and Schelling, although Goethe himself expressly and decidedly refrained from practicing philosophy in the rarefied sense. His other well-known literary works include his numerous poems, the Bildungsroman Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and the epistolary novel The Sorrows of Young Werther.", "title": "Egmont a Tragedy in Five Acts", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1150795.Egmont_a_Tragedy_in_Five_Acts", "average": 3.44, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347528027l/1150795.jpg", "reviews": 20, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/285217.Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe", "name": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe"}], "type": ["Plays", "Drama", "Fiction", "European Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1150795.Egmont_a_Tragedy_in_Five_Acts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15799371-egmont", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209366.Egmont", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20696708-egmont-a-tragedy-in-five-acts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28597712-egmont", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1504092.Egmont", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14706.Faust", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16640.The_Sorrows_of_Young_Werther", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/406373.Faust", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128837.Elective_Affinities", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14707.Faust_Part_Two"]}
