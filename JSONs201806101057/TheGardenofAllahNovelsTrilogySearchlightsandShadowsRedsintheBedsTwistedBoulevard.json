First came World War II. Over the lights and music of the Hollywood Canteen hung the fear that some of these brave boys won\u2019t make it back alive. On the heels of WWII came the paranoia that Commies lurked in every corner and behind every movie, bringing with it the Red Scare. And once the House un-American Activities Committee was finished rattling its publicity-seeking saber, a new threat flourished. This time from the corner of the living room: that plywood book with the teeny, tiny screen. Book Four: Searchlights and Shadows \u2014 The dark days of Pearl Harbor loom over Los Angeles, and posters warn Hollywoodites that loose lips sink ships. MGM screenwriter, Marcus Adler, needs to come up with a sure-fire hit. Gwendolyn Brick dreams of opening her own dress store, but it threatens to drag her back into the orbit of Bugsy Siegel. Columnist, Kathryn Massey survival depend on a place nobody\u2019s heard of: Las Vegas. Book Five: Reds in the Beds  \u2014 As World War II ends, a new boogieman emerges: the Red Menace, and the House un-American Activities Committee prepares to grill the brightest stars in town. MGM writing department head Marcus Adler needs to keep his reputation beyond reproach. Unfortunately in Hollywood, nobody\u2019s past is spotless. Gossip columnist Kathryn Massey may have to take on J. Edgar Hoover himself to shed her FBI informer reputation. And from behind the perfume counter at Bullocks Wilshire, Gwendolyn Brick makes a shocking discovery that could revive her dream and change multiple lives for good. In postwar Hollywood, there are reds in the beds, the sharks are circling, and it\u2019s feeding time. Book Six: Twisted Boulevard \u2014 When ousted screenwriter Marcus Adler hatches a plan to start over with a disgraced movie star, a Hollywood censor reminds him that the misdeeds of the past aren\u2019t soon forgotten. Hollywood Reporter columnist Kathryn Massey is dealing with a hot new rival when she glimpses a haunting sight on the set of Sunset Boulevard. Gwendolyn Brick thought her new store would be a hit, but when LA\u2019s most notorious madam threatens it, she\u2019ll need a Hollywood-style miracle to keep her Chez Gwendolyn alive.
