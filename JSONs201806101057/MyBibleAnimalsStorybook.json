When it arrived I was impressed by the pictures and the content, but knew the true test was how much my grandson liked it. Well, he loves it. It's so wonderful to have a Bible story book that he looks forward to reading. In fact, he picks up the book on his own and pages through it when he comes over. What more could you ask for?"}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23727263-kristina", "userReview": "it took us awhile to read but we finished. my. 3 kids and I enjoyed reading this book. loved all the facts and different questions. it let us have some different discussions.
