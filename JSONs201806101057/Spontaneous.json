The group therapy session is officially canceled. You do not feel better.this is my kind of girl! i was so excited to read the whole thing that i was very bad - i bought it the day it came out - on my birrrrthday - and i pushed it ahead of other books i was \"supposed\" to read, figuring it was YA so it would be fast and i would just love it to pieces before returning to my \"oughtta\" reading list. but i gotta say, despite a really strong open, it kind of meandered its way through the story without a clearly-defined purpose, and i didn't love it as much as those first thirty pages. i love the idea of it - spontaneous human combustion is a criminally underused premise for a book, especially the way it's used here - not as an isolated incident, but as an epidemic that plagues the senior class of a new jersey high school, causing students to suddenly essplode into bloody bits. there's no identifiable cause for the phenomenon, and no way to predict who will pop off, which adds a delicious blanket of WHO WILL COMBUST NEXT?? to the proceedings. at the outset of the phenomenon, there are plenty of theories and speculations floating about the causes - starting with the knee-jerk racist accusation of \"terrorists,\" since the first two kids were darker-than-snow complected: turkish and chinese/korean, followed by blaming everything from sexual orientation to drugs, searching for overlapping characteristics between the kids and grasping at straws. it soon becomes clear that these kids don't have anything in common except being part of the same class and that even students who transferred or tried to leave town are at risk. the FBI rolls in to investigate and quarantine the students, while the remaining kids try to cope any way they can - sex and drugs and rock and roll (in the form of bon jovi, but still\u2026), drinking, parties, distracting themselves with projects, or investigating the situation on their own.but the book kind of falls apart, particularly in the relationships between the characters. at the start, mara and tess are inseparable and their relationship is strong and funny and sweet - they even have their own driving mixes to play loudly and scream-sing to as they roll through town. even when mara starts dating dylan, an enigmatic fellow around whom many unsavory rumors swirl, the relationship doesn't come between the girls, and the three baby-sleuths team up with special agent carla rosetti to get to the bottom of the combustions. but at some point, tess just drifts out of the narrative, with only a vague, weak explanation for her absence. the relationship between dylan and mara is also a bit dubious - coming out of nowhere and requiring the reader to just get on board and not analyze how and why it came to be apart from him being \u2026sad. And dangerous. And fascinating. the same unconvincing quality affects mara's voice - as much as i loved the opening snark and \"fuck this shit\" attitude, she rarely sounds or behaves like a teenage girl, even one of the badass variety. she's wildly inconsistent - she's independent, but jealous of one of dylan's exes to the point of confrontation; she's a bit of a loner, and yet she's suddenly the mouthpiece rallying the remaining students to action; she's extremely close to tess, and yet she avoids her for most of the second half of the book. and she's straight, but there's some lesbian subtext that is never addressed or explored. she and tessa cuddle a lot, including head-in-lap snuggling, they are very free with the \"i love yous\" and \"sweeties\" and hair-braiding and kisses, which might just be the way a male writer thinks teen girls behave (it's not really - i've never put my head in the lap of a female friend unless i was angling for more), but there's also mara's fascination with special agent carla rosetti. at first, it's hero-worship admiration and awe for a powerful lady with a cool car and a badass job, but there's also this: As she bent over and her hair brushed my face, I gave her a good sniff.A little weird, I admit. But also informative.Rosetti wore perfume. Nice perfume. Not that I expected her to smell like coffee and gunpowder, but it was surprising how subtle and soft her scent was. Undergarments were now something to wonder about. What manner of lace was rubbing up against her holsters?now maybe this is another thing a male writer thinks teenage girls do - speculate on the undergarments of other females (they don't. again, not unless they want to see those undergarments scattered in their sheets. sorry to prick that balloon, dudebros (that is a balloon in your pocket, right?) but all that pillow-fighting and casual nudity 80's horror movies convinced you went on all the time whenever two or more girls got together? urban legend. it's just a little frustrating that it's out there without being addressed. while we're pointing out negative reactions - special agent carla rosetti does not act like an FBI agent any more that mara acts like a real world girl.but these are just little complaints. okay, medium-sized complaints. i did enjoy the book overall. it's frequently funny - there's a wonderful scene in which the president addresses the students that had me lol-ing, and i think SHC-as-metaphor for the specific unpredictability of senior year is a neat trick - it captures the uncertainty of the future for these students, the way that people are going to just vanish from your life as everyone scatters to their different colleges and transition into adulthood, close relationships are going to falter, people will be left behind. exploding teens gives a nice carpe diem urgency to those who remain unexploded, but who could be set off at any moment. because that's just what teenagers need, right? more encouragement to live in the moment without regard for the consequences?i also enjoyed the shift in the reactions to the explosions, which continue throughout the book. after they've gone on for a while, people shruggingly adapt to the combustions as just something that happens sometimes.\u2026someone needed to tell the victims' stories. I promised I'd be that someone. It was a promise I most certainly did not keep. Because when things really went off the rails, when spontaneous combustions were so common that we hardly stopped classes for them, when my blood alcohol concentration reached whatever blood alcohol concentration is required to make blackouts a daily thing, I began to lose track of who the victims were.i dunno - it's a good book, but not a great one, even though it does rock the leonard cohen. but i agree with mara - it's an oddly sexxy song to play at the funeral of a teenage girl.but a million points for giving me a spontaneous human combustion novel. the world needs more of them!for more of these, check out: http://explodingactresses.tumblr.com/*******************************************NOW AVAILABLE!! which means that today is my BIRTHDAY! which means i can buy this book for myself for my BIRTHDAY! which sounds nerdy and sad, but is NOT!*******************************************i read the 32-page sneak peek of this that is up on netgalley right now: https://s2.netgalley.com/catalog/book...this is a YA novel about spontaneous human combustion that not only comes out ON MY BORNDAY, but also uses my favorite dickens novel (Bleak House) as its epigraph and also, in the first 32 pages, features a leonard cohen reference; l.c. being my favorite singer/songwriter.so it's pretty much the best thing ever.it is also, i realized once i'd finished reading it, by the same guy that wrote The Riverman, which is itself a pretty rad book.also, it's a YA novel about SPONTANEOUS HUMAN COMBUSTION.and if that's not enough to make you want it, i feel sad for you.i cannot WAIT until i can read the rest of it."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "I don\u2019t know what happened. I was having a blast with this book. Alright, maybe not a blast per se, but it was enjoyable; it was fun, even funny from time to time, its humour comparable to the one in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl and; it just felt original.Until it wasn\u2019t anymore. I did get to page 110, so the good doesn\u2019t just vanish in a turn of page, but something did happen. I don\u2019t know if it was me who suddenly didn\u2019t find Mara as honest and enticing anymore, or if it was the book\u2019s fault.It was the book\u2019s fault.I\u2019m actually still a little befuddled by how quickly the romance appeared in the plot. THAT came out of the blue. Mara was single\u2026 and then she wasn\u2019t anymore. What the hell?And though the whole spontaneous combustion thing had its appeal at first, other people trying to link it to immigrants and gay people kind of drowned my excitement. It was a bit unclear whether the author was trying to send a message through those ka-booms, but I guess I didn\u2019t get far enough to know for sure. But whatever, I had to put a stop to my reading, because Mara was driving me insane with her all-over-the-place thoughts and spontaneous love story. Bleh. Plus, to be fully honest, and I know this is a weird thing to say, but she didn\u2019t exactly have the voice of a teenage girl. A lot of people are going to frown at me for saying this, but she had the voice of a teenage boy. I know, I know, how dare I say such a thing\u2014everyone has a different voice, and what does it even mean to have a \u2018\u2018boy voice?\u2019\u2019 You crazy, Lola.But that\u2019s how I felt. And it was contrived, like the author was trying too hard. Hmm, I wonder if she explodes at the end, too. I wish I were one of those people who feel comfortable reading the ending of a book without even having read the whole story, but I am not. Too bad.

Two words..spontaneous combustion. Do I have your attention? You heard that right\u2026a book about people just randomly going KA-BOOM..exploding!! Pretty cool if you ask me. To make this situation even better, I am here to tell you that I was entertained through and through. There is this great level of dark humor almost on par with something like the movie Heathers.  Spontaneous follows Mara Carlyle, a senior at a New Jersey high school. Everything is going normal, if you will, until suddenly a classmate explodes in the middle of class. This is only the beginning\u2026The local community is mourning while trying to piece it all together. The entire nation find themselves astonished and afraid as they watch these New Jersey seniors spontaneously combust from afar. The FBI is investigating in hope of finding the cause.We\u2019re with Mara as she deals with this phenomenon and the possibility that she too will explode. Her relationships are a huge bonus to the story. Mara\u2019s parents were really cool, ideal parents. Their relationship with their daughter was trusting, realistic, and perfect in this scenario. I was touched by it. Mara also has a great friendship with Tess, her lifelong best friend. It\u2019s a key part of the story and gets such a strong portrayal. The exploration of their friendship elevated the novel for me. There is a romance to top everything off, though it\u2019s not overwhelming to the story.Mara\u2019s voice is very snarky. Some might find her crass. I felt it worked for this type of book. It has a somewhat dark concept, so her voice with that dark sense of humor just really worked for me. The ending might not work for everyone - full answers aren\u2019t exactly given. I still found the read to be pretty satisfying giving me a good laugh here and there.This book has already been picked up to have a film adaptation. I\u2019m excited to see how it turns out. Maybe this will be one of the next big things? Eh? Maybe? It\u2019s certainly unique.

She's snarky and maybe a little rude and a lot hilarious. I absolutely loved the relationship she had with her parents; the honesty between the 3 of them was perfect. Dylan was sweet and a little weird, but it really worked.I could have loved this book, I could have been obsessed with it. However, there were some things that didn't get explained and some plot lines that didn't make any sense to me. And while the ending was oddly satisfying, there's only a general idea of what happened and I hate that with a passion.Overall, the story was unique and captivating. It was hilarious and heartbreaking and I really enjoyed it.

This book was... Very strange. I thought it would be amazing five months ago when I read the sampler, but it turned out to be another book in which a male author depicts a terrible version of what a girl thinks and acts like. It also seemed like the author was relying too heavily upon the concept of spontaneous combustion instead of actually focusing on developing more realistic and compelling characters and making sure the plot actually makes sense and isn't all over the place. I honestly don't know why I continued to read past the first few chapters. I probably would've DNFed this, if I hadn't been giving this book the benefit of the doubt the entire time.

You do not feel better.Okay, right off the bat, before we get into all the awesome things about this story, let me make one thing perfectly clear.Some people are bound to\u00a0not like this\u00a0main character.\u00a0She\u2019s opinionated, and lazy, and morbid. She does drugs, falls in love too quickly, makes snap-judgements, and making jokes is her biggest coping mechanism.She\u2019s\u00a0the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral* if you will.But, you know what?

Stories about troubled teenagers often feature support groups where smart-ass comments fly and feelings get hurt, where friends and enemies are forged over one-liners and tears.

The fact that she was Turkish didn\u2019t help. And even though they didn\u2019t find a bomb or any explosives or anything (she had just spontaneously combusted), people pointed fingers. The senior class was scarred for life, and so began a time full of soft nothings and therapy sessions- that is when an Asian-American student blew up during one of those very counseling sessions. That was when people slowed down and thought, \u201calright, this is weird.\u201d The senior class is at risk: kids are blowing up left and right. There is no explanation. Is it a government conspiracy, is it an experiment, is it some sort of curse? Does it even matter what it is? Mara\u2019s trying to live her life among the humdrum of spontaneous explosions; she\u2019s just trying to love her new boyfriend and keep her shit together long enough to graduate and do something with her life. But will she survive?Back in July, I read a short teaser of this book on Netgalley, and it became one of my most anticipated releases of the year. The teaser did such a fantastic job of establishing the voice of the novel; snarky, morbid, strong and a tad bit offensive- basically everything I can want from a narrator. When I traded a copy of one of my books for an ARC of Spontaneous, I couldn\u2019t wait to dive back into the strange mind of this narrator who managed to retain her morbid sense of humor when people she knew were literally exploding. And while parts of this book definitely gave me that initial spark that drew me to the teaser, I have to say that the beginning was the strongest part of the novel.By far the greatest quality of Spontaneous is the voice of the narrator, and perhaps even the narrator herself. Starmer wields the sharp intelligence of Mara\u2019s character so skillfully; her voice is never overbearing. Despite her somewhat offensive sense of humor, she is so genuine in everything she does that it becomes endearing. She\u2019s a bad-ass young woman who is headstrong, who is feisty and sarcastic and so full of sass, but she\u2019s also an incredibly reclusive young woman. Who\u2019s afraid to open up, who keeps her feelings buried deep within herself, often disguising her vulnerabilities with a sharp quip here, a jab there. Honestly, I kept reading the book for her- I was so invested and so in love with Mara\u2019s person that I did not care that I wasn\u2019t fully enjoying the book.On the topic of characters, the side characters were a bit of a let-down. Which is a shame because I know from the protagonist\u2019s depth that Starmer can create brilliant characters, but I felt that he didn\u2019t do the side/peripheral characters justice. However, despite them not feeling fully fleshed-out, their relationships with Mara were so wonderfully tangible. Mara\u2019s newly-realized romance with Dylan was a little insta-lovey, perhaps, but their feelings for each other felt so genuine. Not to mention that this book has one of the strongest, greatest female-friendship duos I have ever read, EVER. Tess didn\u2019t particularly feel like someone I knew, but she felt like someone I loved because of how much Mara loved her. The family dynamics, too, felt realistic \u2013 even though they weren\u2019t developed much. Mara\u2019s parents were mostly in the background, but they clearly played a role in her life. Am I making sense? I don\u2019t think I am\u2026But despite all this, the plot fizzled out after the first 50-60 pages. It went from a hilarious rollercoaster full of laugh-out-loud moments of teenage explosion to a somewhat slow read about romance, where the main premise of the novel was put to the backseat- when it was obviously the selling-point of the entire book. It went from an intelligent and subtle political and social satire \u2013 exploring homophobia, prejudice and xenophobia- to just another contemporary. I enjoyed reading Mara\u2019s developments, her struggle with both external and internal factors, but I feel like (and I know this sounds silly) I picked this book up for something else, something I didn\u2019t get after the beginning. Which is a shame, because I genuinely think this book could have been something that everyone would talk about.Overall, I definitely think this book is still worth reading- particularly if you enjoy the work of Andrew Smith (who wrote Winger) or John Green. Both those authors do a brilliant job of writing narrative voice. I definitely think that if you enjoy their work, this one will appeal to you.On DiversityFinally, I\u2019d like to talk a little about diversity. We\u2019ve seen many conversations take place over the course of the past few weeks about the importance of diversity, the importance of seeing yourself in a novel. I\u2019d just like to point out that while Spontaneous isn\u2019t a \u201cdiverse\u201d book, per se, it does something unique- something that I really appreciated. The main characters are all white- at least, their races have not been specified, which pretty much means they are canonically white. However, the peripheral cast of characters is so diverse! One of the aims of diversifying reading, in my opinion, is to make the majority realize that the world is not white, cishet, straight and able-bodied. The world is full of people who do not fit those molds and Starmer makes sure that his book reflects the world the way it is.While they do not play prominent roles, we have several black characters, as well as people who are disabled, who are gay, who are Muslim or East Asian or South Asian or Hispanic, none of whom pander to stereotypes or tired clich\u00e9s. I mean, the openly gay character was a football player- and I really appreciated that. Even just making sure that the Covington senior class was so diverse makes an obvious statement: your story may revolve around white characters, okay, but you can do that without ignoring how diverse this world really is. Again, I wouldn\u2019t characterize this book as a \u201cdiverse\u201d read- it\u2019s just something I thought I might point out.Teaser Review:Phenomenal. Laugh-out-loud funny with a narrator who's humor is snarky, morbid and a tad bit offensive- the result is a well-established, strong voice with a protagonist so genuine that you can't help but fall in love with her in the first few pages. This may have become one of my most anticipated releases for the year!

There's a lot of talk about the origins of the \"curse\" and the true motives of Rosetti and neither one of these major plot threads gets resolved by the end, which was very frustrating for me. It left me feeling both like it needed a sequel and like a sequel would be a bad idea. I don't need everything to be tied up in pretty bows, but maybe if the whys and wherefores were less heavily emphasized, my frustration would have been less.But, damn. Overall, this book was amazeballs and if you want a book that's a bit Monty Python, a large dollop of Heathers, and a scoop of Andrew Smith, this is definitely the book for you."}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24192636-kara", "userReview": "DNFing on page 64.

The book is consistently snarky and snappy without it ever feeling like anyone is trying too hard. Along with that come Mara's witty descriptions. Through her, the author paints pictures that perfectly capture the other characters and events of the book, if not visually, then emotionally and psychologically.Along with the writing, the premise is an intriguing one: a particular group of senior high school students is spontaneously combusting. But how, and why, and what effect will it have on the survivors? The book is mostly focused on that last question, which is not a problem per se, but these teenagers go through many stages along the way to find very little in the way of a destination. The book meanders along for so long while Mara experiences her growth from feeling \"invigorated\" to not feeling anything to feeling passionate only about her best friend Tess.In the meantime, we get very little time to develop any kind of affection ourselves for Tess. She wanders in and out of the story, hinting mysteriously at some discovery she's making and important information that she has for Mara - none of which ever really gets revealed, other than she loves Mara. Which we knew at the beginning because Mara has told us.The end result is that the novel tales the reader on a long ride to mostly end up back where we started. This is part of the point: Mara will always be who she is, and Tess as well, and the permanence of them and their friendship is what matters. But I didn't need 350 pages to get there, especially after not spending enough time with Tess earlier to care. In the end, that lack of satisfaction at the end doesn't do justice to the snappy writing, leading me to give the book 2.5 stars - rounded down until Goodreads gives me some half stars."}, {"userName": "Felicity Jackson (gowithflick)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55909774-felicity-jackson-gowithflick", "userReview": "This was such a great read!

After Katelyn's untimely demise more seniors start blowing up. After suspecting terrorism, suicide, and other sundry conspiracies, the town of Covington soon realizes that the high school seniors are falling victim to spontaneous combustion.No one knows why it's happening. No one knows who might be next.All Mara and her best friend Tess want to do is make it to graduation in one piece. But that might be harder than they think as students keep popping with no obvious pattern or warning. Mara's senior year is going to have love, friendship, drugs, and even more explosions than the usual high school drama would suggest in Spontaneous (2016) by Aaron Starmer.Mara's first-person narration is dark, no-nonsense, and sometimes blatantly insensitive as she tries to make sense of her friends and classmates blowing up. She deals with the stress and the possibility of her own eventual demise with humor and avoidance.Starmer's prose is snappy and substantive. Like many critically acclaimed novels, Spontaneous strikes a good balance between philosophical and absurd. Unfortunately, much of the story also feels like it is being spoon-fed to readers with heavy-handed descriptions and plotting.Spontaneous isn't the first quasi-literary YA novel to be written by a male author with a female protagonist. It also won't be the last. Unfortunately, and this speaks to a number of potential flaws in the text, nothing about this book makes it matter that Mara is a girl. She could be anyone from any background. Nothing about her feels distinct or unique, begging the question why is this her story and not the story of one of the other unlucky seniors at Covington High School?Throughout the novel, Mara keeps readers at a remove both from herself and from the other characters who populate the novel. While possibly a deliberate decision by Starmer, it does little to endear Mara to readers or generate much interest in her story.Unfortunately an interesting premise and strong writing are not enough to make Spontaneous a compelling story.

But with its oddity came bursts of comedy and surprisingly real commentary on the adolescent experience of having those in your grade spontaneously combust around you (the pun may or may not have been intended). While the protagonist's quirkiness may be something that takes some getting used to, I believe that this was an enjoyable read that some may love, and others may dislike. To get the negative out of the way, I think that one of the main reasons why others may dislike this novel is because of the quirkiness of the protagonist, Mara. The plot is fascinating and unique, but her view of the world may be less than desirable for some. Also, her quirky storytelling may not be for everyone and while I was a fan, I can definitely see where the unusual storytelling might ruffle some feathers. Some readers like order and a dependable story form, which on occasion Spontaneous appears to override.With that being said, however, the character relationships are great. Mara's friendship with her best friend, Tess, is inspiring (if not bordering on almost romantic, but perhaps I am reading too much into it). I liked that despite everything, they still kept it real and avoided the dramatic side-effects that some young adult friendships experience. Mara's parents were everything one might wish for if they were ever in a similar and unfortunate situation. I liked that they were there enough to not constitute as absent, but that they understood that their daughter was on the cusp of being an adult and not just a victim (not hovering parents). Perhaps my favourite aspect of this novel is that Starmer is fantastic at similes and metaphors. He whips them out occasionally and it could all be thanks to his protagonist, who I admittedly learned to love...after a couple of sentences. Mara's voice, in my opinion, is the perfect narration for the weirdness happening in Spontaneous. Her unpredictability, refusal to admit what she's feeling, and her unapologetic sense of humour both pulled me in, and made me realize how unreliable she can be. Mara is probably one of the realest high school Seniors I've read about in a long time, but there are moments full of self-pity and substance abuse that made her point of view sometimes blurry. Mara has sex, she's the occasional hardcore drinker, and she's tried a few drugs here and there. I know it's not good to admire a character for these qualities, and okay, I don't actually admire her for them. The reason why these qualities seem important to me is that a) Mara is a TEENAGER who has life experiences beyond moping for a boy, or thinking about college (though, ok, that is sometimes a thought), b) Her sometimes destructive behaviour can be understandably linked to her situation, and c) her parents were really cool and realistic, but they were neither absent nor oblivious to her actions. Does all of my fangirling about Mara mean that I didn't notice her imperfections? No. I still got annoyed by several of her actions. Her humour was great, but the self deprecation was sometimes a little too thick in some parts. Mara is a character who's easy to love and hate. The storytelling is another thing I loved about Starmer's novel. He captures the craziness of the situation in how he breaks up the chapters and how he presents the chapter headings. There's a particular chapter where a kid blows up and it just sort of happens. This happens as if it's just a passing comment like \"oh, he exploded. Okay,\" kind of thing, which is exactly how I'd imagine it would be if it happened in front of me as many times as it happens in front of Mara. Starmer both showcases Mara's sense of humour and the randomness of the spontaneous combustion by nonchalantly bringing up that another character has died before the end of a chapter, or by simply cutting a character's dialogue off. The humour in this made me feel like a terrible person, I'm not even going to lie. I never thought that I'd read a novel that features spontaneously combusting teens and laugh while I turn the pages. Every time a kid exploded, I felt like I was there. Every time Mara made an off-colour joke, I was laughing. Even during situations that called for a straight face, I couldn't help but giggle. This book was just so silly and funny and different. But like I mentioned earlier in my review, the humour was occasionally interrupted by beautiful choices of words, or descriptions. Underneath the grimness and Mara's darkly funny view of her world, Starmer's beautiful writing shines. He has the ability to make Mara, a character who is so hard to take seriously, into someone more aware than we previously thought. This is successfully done by instances where Mara will comment on the morbidity of her situation. There's a great quote in the ARC that I have that I absolutely love: \"I used to think that sunsets were cheesy, that they were images of uninspired sentimentality\" (Starmer). It may seem simple and very pessimistic, but I love the potential for truth under those words because everyone experiences things differently. Written in surprisingly addicting prose, Spontaneous is a great fix for anyone wanting a dose of weird, especially if you've read Grasshopper Jungle by Andrew Smith. Starmer's novel is surprisingly quirky, real, and a darkly fascinating view into the life of a teenager who may or may not spontaneously combust like so many of her classmates.

I mean, spontaneously combusting teenagers, how can you not be just a little bit intrigued by that premise? And I've got to say, this was one hell of a ride. It's wasn't wild necessarily, but it was claw-your-eyes out boring either. I don't think I've ever read a book like Spontaneous, because I don't think there's a book out there with a message like Spontaneous.So, the first thing you need to know about this book, before the plot and themes and the yada yada yada, is that it can get very, very, VERY pretentious. Like, I'm talking John Green level unrealistic philosophical teenagers mixed with obvious symbolism of the Matrix pretentious. There were parts of this novel I literally groaned at, because teenagers usually don't sit around and have deep, philosophical conversations while lying with their boyfriends (usually). These parts are few and far between, but they just feel so long, like it goes on forever. Personally, after the second meaningful conversation I just decided to say \"fuck it\" and skipped over those parts and it didn't take away from my reading experience.Despite that, Mara's voice is authentic. She reads like an actual teenager, snarky and some-what self-centered, clever and ambitious. She was a great narrator for this story, because she responds so well to the plot. The events she witnesses throughout the book and the things she does shape her narrative. Her voice remains constant, but the tone of the book shifts as Mara spirals further into the plot. I have to applaud Starmer as well, because the dark comic tone worked wonderfully for this book. When you can make exploding teenagers funny, you know you've got a talent and Starmer's got it. With a book about exploding teenagers, the main thing you probably want would be the why? Why are teens randomly exploding? And this book deals with that. I wouldn't call it a dystopian exactly, but I would say it does deal with hysteria. Everything from homosexuality to drugs to government conspiracy are named and blamed for the spontaneous combustion of Mara's classmates, but there's nothing ever definitive. This book doesn't point out and say \"this is what's causing the problem and here's how to fix it.\" And that message is essentially the theme of the story. Everyone's looking for meaning, what do these exploding teenagers mean, and they don't get it. Does giving this random event meaning change anything? Does it suddenly make it more or less significant because there's some over arching meaning behind it?This book, at least my reading of it, deals with how we try to find meaning in everything and sometimes, most of the time, there isn't one. Not everything means something and we as a species just aren't prepared for that. We like every word, every action, to mean something, to be a part of something bigger. But, that's not life. Life has no meaning and giving meaning to life's smaller parts isn't going to change that. And that's what his book really is, coming to terms with an existence where meaning isn't always found in our everyday lives. And I think that's pretty fucking deep."}, {"userName": "bookfan81", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22494431-bookfan81", "userReview": "I got sucked in by the John Green quote (whom I love), but this book didn't do it for me.Original, yes. I can't say I've ever read anything like SPONTANEOUS. The writing is good and very conversational. My only issue with the writing is that despite being told from a girl's POV, it felt like a guy was writing it (if that makes sense. I've read plenty of male authors writing this way, John Green's FIOS for example, that believably pulled off a female POV, but this didn't for me). It's such a weird idea, kids spontaneously exploding, but the actual narrative here is on the boring side. Mara has a very random way of thinking, and she's prone to tangents and flashbacks that don't do much. The whole book has a meandering feel to it. Pretty much every named character gets a few pages of context and backstory, and considering that there are probably a few dozen (or more) named characters in SPONTANEOUS, it kills what little momentum there was to begin with.There's a romance of a sort, but like everything else in this book, I was left feeling pretty indifferent by it. Maybe that's my real problem here: I didn't care about Mara or any of the many, many other characters that wandered on or off the page. I didn't find the humor all that humorous either, dark or otherwise. I don't know. The other early reviews are all very positive, so maybe this is just not the book for me.
