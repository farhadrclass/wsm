Let your voice ring out, and don't let anybody fiddle with it. Never turn down a good idea, but never take a bad idea. And meditate. It's very important to experience that Self, that pure consciousness...start diving within, enlivening that bliss consciousness. Grow in happiness and intuition. Experience the joy of doing. And you'll glow in this peaceful way. Your friends will be very, very happy with you. Everyone will want to sit next to you. And people will give you money!-actual quote.Make no mistake: I love David Lynch, but this book is just silly. It reads like a monologue by an excitable, over-sugared 10-year-old. I was hoping this would be more like an extended Agent Cooper scene, but I guess his quaint little aphorisms don't really work out of context. If you're looking for guidance when it comes to meditation, this is the wrong book, as the extent of the instructions are \"to meditate: meditate.\" If you're looking for a Peak (sorry) into Lynch's creative process, what you get is shit that's basically like this: I was standing there, and then I had this image of a red room, and then I saw curtains as the red walls, and then I thought of a zigzaggy floor, and that's how I came up with the red room. And that's how it works! That's film-making!\" And this is me: a half-hearted, glassy-eyed \"Oh, coooool...\"Why two stars? Well, sometimes his happy-go-lucky reflections on his career and the people he has worked with were kinda precious. Also, I learned that the O.J. Simpson trial was an inspirational force in Lost Highway, and that Mulholland Drive was originally intended to be a television series before it was shot down by ABC. Finally, I couldn't help but read the book in a Gordon Cole yell, which afforded much amusement."}, {"userName": "Alfred", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/241568-alfred", "userReview": "I recommend listening to this in the Audiobooks version. I listened to it on my iPod and it put me in a great place. David Lynch has this great soothing monotone voice that radiates the sincerity and peacefulness of his message. It's sort of like the first time I heard Jimi Hendrix speak...it's like how can a man whose art contains such darkness and violence come off as so soft and loving and sensitive? But I guess that's why they call them artists.This book reaffirmed my desire to meditate. If a 4.5 rating were possible, I would give it here, but alas it is not."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155996-nick", "userReview": "Waste of time. This Transcendental Meditation-proselytizing piece of horseshit provides no insight into Lynch; for all the time he spends meditating, you'd think he'd be more reflective. Instead, we get chapters like this: \"How does meditation get rid of negativity? Picture it this way: You are the Empire State Building. You've got hundreds of rooms. And in those rooms, there's a lot of junk. And you put all that junk there. Now you take this elevator, which is going to be the dive within. And you go down below the building; you go to the Unified Field beneath the building - pure consciousness. And it's like electric gold. You experience that. And that electric gold activates these little cleaning robots. They start going, and they start cleaning the rooms. They put in gold where the dirt and junk and garbage were. These stresses aht were in there like coils of barbed wire can unwind. They evaporate, they come out. You're cleaning and infusing simultaneously. You're on the road to a beautiful state of enlightenment.\"Wow, thanks, dude, that's really helpful.

A few pages contain mere paragraphs, some a modest few lines. It's what you might expect from an artist on the subject of his process, especially when the muse is inextricably intertwined with transcendental meditation. This is David Lynch's attempt to explain his approach to craft, be it film or art or woodworking, and the manner in which he intuits direction; navigating the course of his passions through the balance he obtains in his spiritual life.Lynch charts some of his cinematic journey through the lens of these metaphysical beliefs. Eraserhead, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive are among the projects mentioned, but you should know going in that this is rarely about the business end of making those movies. Instead, he's concentrating on how he reached certain decisions while constructing them. He sticks to the theme of creativity through a meditative template, and so the material skews to appeal primarily to the Lynchian acolyte over the garden variety fan.I come for an odd reason. Dune. As this is a film he has disowned, it's rare to find him discussing it. He did a little of that here. Not enough, though."}, {"userName": "Don Roff", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/382294-don-roff", "userReview": "David Lynch has always been an inspiration to me. His films, of course, but also his painting, his carpentry, and even his unfilmed scenarios like RONNIE ROCKET and ONE SALIVA BUBBLE are beautiful mysteries waiting to be uncovered. And now, a book.Though Lynch doesn't consider himself much of a writer \"I have trouble with words\" he admits, this book went a bit deeper than much of the work he has previously displayed to the public. I say book, however, I listened to the audio book, read by Lynch himself (a used copy of the book is still en route from an Amazon vendor, which I will read upon arrival). With my iPod headphones on, I had Lynch penetrating my brain for over three hours (one complete reading is 108 minutes).Lynch, who is infamous about not talking about his work (he thinks DVD director commentaries on DVD are sacrilegious) opens up like never before. He talks about his ideas, his creative process, and most intimately, his experience with Transcendental Meditation. The cynic might think that this book and its recording is an 108-minute infomercial for Transcendental Meditation and its founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. I don't believe it is. Lynch approaches the mindful practice with his same Jimmy Stewart \"gee whiz\" enthusiasm as with everything else he does. If you are a writer, filmmaker, artist, or simply a person interested in the creative process (the Art Life, as Lynch describes it), or Transcendental Meditation, this book was written especially for you."}, {"userName": "Thalia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/958170-thalia", "userReview": "I bought this book randomly in an airport bookstore in Japan on my way back from a trip to Thailand. I've always been a fan of David Lynch's tv and film work and had heard that he is into TM and even had started a school about it. I was intrigued. I love this little book. The chapters are short - most just one or two pages. They are about art, movies, ideas, conciousness, enlightenment, meditation, Bob's Big Boy and more. They are funny and surreal and its kind of like having a conversation with him about Life. Like a really deep conversation that leaves you smiling. This book is like a super cool friend you'd meet at a dull party and sneak out with into a starry night to talk for hours about random beautiful stuff."}, {"userName": "Nora|KnyguDama", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24881652-nora-knygudama", "userReview": "David Lynch, kaip tikriausiai ir dauguma, pa\u017einau d\u0117ka \"Tvin Pykso\". \u0160\u012f serial\u0105 dievinu jau nuo vaikyst\u0117s.

It may inspire and motivate, but it won't inform. Lynch briefly describes the benefits of Transcendental Meditation. Not only will it greatly enhance your creativity, but it will also greatly enhance your life. And there the lesson ends. If you meditate, greatly enhanced creativity just happens. Lynch then spends the majority of the book on various anecdotes about how he came up with specific ideas for various film projects. Essentially, they just happened - because he meditates.The book is a brief memoir of Lynch's work on various film projects, the ideas for which he attributes to his practice of transcendental meditation. The details on the film projects are too brief to be of interest to anyone but a Lynch scrapbooker. And the information about meditation is too scant to be of use to anyone with an interest in starting. If the benefits of transcendental meditation are as natural and automatic as Lynch suggests, then the book will be of no value to those already practising. So it is clearly intended for those who do not. Yet it provides no information about how to go about it, nor does it provide any suggestions for further reading / study / instruction. This seems like a fairly big missed opportunity for putting people on the right track ( as he is fond of saying ).

They're like a vice grip on creativity. If you're in that grip you can hardly get out of bed, much less experience the flow of creativity and ideas. You must have clarity to create.

He even sings its glory in his song \u2018Jesus Children of America\u2019. The problem is that none of the books about transcendental meditation, for example HH Maharishi\u2019s own \u2018Science of Being and Art of Living,\u2019 say anything about transcendental meditation, they all just sing the praises of TM in an almost glassy eyed fervor, this book being no exception. Tm is good, TM is great, but what exactly is it? What does it try to achieve? Even an imprecise picture would be helpful for people like me whose experience of meditation is free classes issued through Zen and Zen based institutions. For me, a firm believer that \u2018God said you must teach as I have taught, for free\u2019, the $3,000 to learn TM leaves a bad taste, but that said I think that I would be able to get around it if anyone was willing to educate about what it is, after all the $3,000, while being a lot of money, is a one time fee. Even the people that I call on the phone, when I ask them what it is, all that they tell me is that I have to take the class to find out. When going further into Maharishi\u2019s practice and philosophies, it\u2019s almost impossible to not get into the dozens of women who accused him of rape, which leaves one questioning the teachings of this religious leader. Not to mention his famous dealings with The Beatles, who accused him of a healthy sexual appetite for young women as well as a shrewed business side, which he must have had in order to leave behind two-billion dollars when he died. John Lennon penned a song about Maharishi, but then changed the lyrics of his song from \u2018Maharishi\u2019 to \u2018Sexy Sadie\u2019 in the end. There were also several confrontations between The Beatles and the Maharishi regarding the band feeling exploited by the guru, that he used the band for his own promotion.In the end though, it\u2019s the art, or the teachings, that people remember and not the man. John Coltrane had a shady figure, though tried to fix himself many time and again. In the end, he battled with addiction his whole life, but his music and musings on Christianity eventually inspired The Church of Coltrane, and I\u2019m not sure that this many years after his death it can be argued that his battles with heroin have inspired teachings about opiates. So maybe this new technique of meditation, the teachings of Maharishi, can lead to a more fulfilling life. Certainly to hear David Lynch talk about his TM practice you would think so, as well as many of the people who have had the opportunity to learn TM. Lynch talks about he release of his anger, which he hadn\u2019t even noticed until his wife pointed it out. He talks about going deep to find the big idea down there, which sounds great. I would love to go deep and find the \u2018Big fish.\u2019 Tell me more about it, I say. But this is not a book to learn about the teachings of the Maharishi, that book may not exist. And if Lynch approached this book as an investigation into his spiritual practice or to educate the curious about what is wonderful about TM, then he failed utterly. Instead, like so many of the followers, Lynch speaks in metaphors that only cloud the understanding of this mysterious spirituality. The reader is certain about Lynch's devotion. Lynch has created TM centers for children and has lectured all over about the benefits of TM, and this book ends up being an open love note to his religion.What might be redeemable about this book is for the fan of David Lynch, this book gives talks about his creative process in a way that no other book on Lynch does, not even the book, 'Lynch On Lynch' where David outlined and wrote about his early film career. Where that book reads like a memoir and the reader is treated to such things as Lynch's dismay over having the movie 'Dune' taken from his control and the reasons behind his decision to not direct 'Star Wars: Return of the Jedi', this book reads of short philosophic ramblings on Lynch's own creativity. The question that is always asked of authors, artists and filmmakers is 'Where do you get your ideas,' which always manages to stump the artist. After all, the muses are mysterious. And the answers of artists vary from serious to snarky. This book seems to be an honest attempt to give an answer to David's fans. And how are you doing Jo-jo."}, {"userName": "Marta Urushadze", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18419964-marta-urushadze", "userReview": "\u10db\u10d0\u10d2\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8 \u10e0\u10dd\u10df\u10d0\u10d0. \u10db\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 \u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10db\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d8\u10e1\u10d4 \u10d0\u10e0 \u10db\u10d8\u10e7\u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10e1, \u10e0\u10dd\u10d2\u10dd\u10e0\u10ea \u10db\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8 \u10dc\u10d8\u10ed\u10d8 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10e1\u10d0\u10db\u10e7\u10d0\u10e0\u10dd. \u10da\u10d8\u10dc\u10e9\u10d8 \u10d2\u10d0\u10ee\u10e1\u10dc\u10d8\u10da\u10d8\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d9\u10dd\u10e1\u10db\u10dd\u10e1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10db\u10d7\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d4\u10dc\u10d4\u10e0\u10d2\u10d8\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10db\u10d0\u10e1\u10e8\u10d8 \u10d2\u10d0\u10d3\u10d8\u10e1, \u10e0\u10d0\u10d3\u10d2\u10d0\u10dc \u10db\u10d4\u10d3\u10d8\u10e2\u10d8\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10e1 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d1\u10d4\u10d3\u10dc\u10d8\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8\u10d0. \u10d7\u10e3 \u10d0\u10e1\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8 \u10d1\u10d4\u10d3\u10dc\u10d8\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8 \u10ee\u10d0\u10e0 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10db\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10d3\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0\u10e1 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10e1\u10d8\u10e7\u10d5\u10d0\u10e0\u10e3\u10da\u10e1 \u10e5\u10d0\u10d3\u10d0\u10d2\u10d4\u10d1, \u10e8\u10d4\u10dc\u10d8 \u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10db\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d0\u10e1\u10d4\u10d7\u10d8 \u10d1\u10dc\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10e1\u10d0\u10e1\u10e2\u10d8\u10d9\u10d8 \u10e0\u10d0\u10e2\u10dd\u10db \u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1\u10dd- \u10d9\u10d8\u10d7\u10ee\u10d4\u10e1. \u10d4\u10d2 \u10e0\u10d0 \u10e8\u10e3\u10d0\u10e8\u10d8\u10d0, \u10d2\u10d0\u10e0\u10e8\u10d4\u10db\u10dd \u10e0\u10d0\u10e1\u10d0\u10ea \u10d5\u10ee\u10d4\u10d3\u10d0\u10d5 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10db\u10d0\u10d8\u10dc\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10d4\u10e1\u10d4\u10d1\u10e1, \u10db\u10d0\u10d2\u10d0\u10d6\u10d4 \u10d5\u10d8\u10e6\u10d4\u10d1 \u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10db\u10d4\u10d1\u10e1\u10dd. \u10db\u10d0\u10d2\u10e0\u10d0\u10db \u10d7\u10d5\u10d8\u10d7\u10dd\u10dc \u10e0\u10d4\u10df\u10d8\u10e1\u10dd\u10e0\u10d8 \u10d0\u10e3\u10ea\u10d8\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d4\u10da\u10d8 \u10d0\u10e0 \u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1, \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10d0\u10db \u10d2\u10d0\u10e0\u10d4\u10db\u10dd\u10e1 \u10dc\u10d0\u10ec\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 \u10d8\u10e7\u10dd\u10e1\u10dd. \u10de\u10d8\u10e0\u10d8\u10e5\u10d8\u10d7, \u10e0\u10d0\u10ea \u10e3\u10e4\u10e0\u10dd \u10d4\u10dc\u10d4\u10e0\u10d2\u10d8\u10e3\u10da\u10d8\u10d0 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d2\u10d0\u10ec\u10db\u10d4\u10dc\u10d3\u10d8\u10da\u10d8, \u10db\u10d8\u10d7 \u10e3\u10e4\u10e0\u10dd \u10db\u10d0\u10d2\u10e0\u10d0\u10d3 \u10d8\u10db\u10e3\u10e8\u10d0\u10d5\u10d4\u10d1\u10e1 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10e1 \u10db\u10dd\u10e3\u10e7\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10d0\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10e1 \u10d4\u10e0\u10d7 \u10e4\u10d8\u10da\u10db\u10e8\u10d8\u10dd. \u10ee\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10d5\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8 \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10d3\u10d0\u10e2\u10d0\u10dc\u10ef\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10e3\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0 \u10d8\u10e7\u10dd\u10e1, \u10d4\u10e1 \u10db\u10d8\u10d7\u10d8\u10d0\u10dd. \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d5\u10d4\u10d7\u10d0\u10dc\u10ee\u10db\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8.\u10d8\u10d3\u10d4\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 \u10d7\u10d4\u10d5\u10d6\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10d5\u10d8\u10d7\u10d0\u10d0. \u10e0\u10d0\u10ea \u10e3\u10e4\u10e0\u10dd \u10e6\u10e0\u10db\u10d0\u10d3 \u10e9\u10d0\u10ea\u10e3\u10e0\u10d0\u10d5 \u10e1\u10d0\u10d9\u10e3\u10d7\u10d0\u10e0 \u10ea\u10dc\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8\u10d4\u10e0\u10e8\u10d8, \u10db\u10d8\u10d7 \u10e3\u10e4\u10e0\u10dd \u10d3\u10d8\u10d3 \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d2\u10d0\u10dc\u10e1\u10ee\u10d5\u10d0\u10d5\u10d4\u10d1\u10e3\u10da \u10d7\u10d4\u10d5\u10d6\u10e1 \u10d3\u10d0\u10d8\u10ed\u10d4\u10e0. \u10ea\u10dc\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8\u10d4\u10e0\u10e8\u10d8 \u10e9\u10d0\u10e1\u10d0\u10e7\u10d5\u10d8\u10dc\u10d7\u10d0\u10d3 \u10d9\u10d8 \u10db\u10d4\u10d3\u10d8\u10e2\u10d0\u10ea\u10d8\u10d0 \u10d2\u10ed\u10d8\u10e0\u10d3\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/201711-john", "userReview": "\"if you have a golf ball-sized consciousness, when you read a book, you'll have a golf ball-sized understanding; when you look out a window, a golf ball-sized awareness; when you wake up in the morning, a golf ball-sized wakefulness; and as you go about your day, a golf ball-sized inner happiness.\"quirky, thoughtful meditations on consciousness, meditation, and the creative process. surprisingly inspiring."}, {"userName": "Peter Derk", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk", "userReview": "This is great.

TM sounds close-ish, or like maybe it provides the good side of religion.But, the things I do have experience with, I think I would say it's a mistake to spend a lot of money up front. Let's talk exercise. Do I think it's good for people to get into exercise? YES! Do I think it's a good idea to spend $1500 to get certified in a proprietary form of exercise, like Crossfit or Zumba? Fuck no!Let's talk writing. Do I think it's a good idea for a person to take a shot at writing? Fuck yeah! Do I think you should buy some pricey gizmo right off the bat? Hell to the no!I sort of think that any habit, whether it's artistic, physical, whatever, is something you should be able to try out without spending $500+ dollars before you've even begun. I mean, for real, let's have a challenge here. Is there a hobby or habit or something that requires you to spend more than $500 to have a starter level entry?You can be a filmmaker with your phone. You can get a pad and a pen. Hell, you can even get on a motorcycle and at least try it out without spending $500.I think I'd like to try TM or something very much like it. But, to be honest, I guess I don't think my inner calm is worth $500. Or, maybe I should say I don't think there's $500 of inner calm to be found inside me.

My first experience of Lynchian style was a late night showing of his classic 'Blue Velvet', which I went to see at my favourite. We were flabbergasted by the end thinking 'what have we just seen?' And of course, his films and their specific style take some getting used to. All we knew was that we were mesmerised.A fellow fan of Lynch loaned me this book to read, and I have to say that it was a really interesting read. It was nice to be able to get into Lynch's mindset, and here him talk about various things including his transcendental meditation and some of his films. He included tips on creativity, as well as how to achieve happiness, and some little anecdotes about the creation of some of his pieces.I once looked into transcendental meditation but I believe it is extremely expensive to start, which is a shame unfortunately as Lynch makes it sound incredibly appealing. As a very creative person who never finds much time to relax and create, I would love to be able to incorporate the practice into my everyday routine. Maybe it will require some more looking into, I don't know.I wouldn't really recommend this book unless you're a big Lynch fan, unless you are really interested in the meditation and consciousness side. However, if you do love his work, be sure to pick this up and dip in and out of it occasionally, or read it cover to cover anyway. What you take from it is entirely personal to you, but it will bring instant satisfaction on at least some level."}, {"userName": "Niklas Pivic", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2106358-niklas-pivic", "userReview": "While providing some clear, lucid insights into his creative process, how he worked before discovering transcendental meditation, and interesting trivia such as descriptions of happy accidents on how his films are made and what Kubrick's favourite film was (\"Eraserhead\", according to Lynch), there's also a downside.Lynch does get me interested in transcendental meditation, but the theme is so regurgitated and repeated throughout the entire book that he feels a bit like a cult member trying to lure you in. It's very \"transcendental meditation can cure anything, make you do anything, will overcome anything\". I particularly disliked the chapter where you're to imagine you're the Empire State Building and transcendental meditation is electric gold; just swap the junk in all your rooms for the electric gold and you're all good. Yeah.To me, it all reeks of an empty promise, mainly because Lynch doesn't explain how transcendental meditation works. And that knowledge, my dears, is expensive to attain.So, if you can shut the lid on that all-permeating aspect of the book, Lynch does bring interesting stream-of-consciousness stuff to the table, especially on how he's overcome obstacles in his creative process and how he seems very open to new things that influence and come to him."}, {"userName": "Mack Hayden", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack-hayden", "userReview": "Listened to the audiobook for this one and getting to hear it in Lynch's own voice makes it all the better. Definitely don't go here if you're on the lookout for something clearcut. But I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't even expect that from Lynch to begin with. A lot of great thoughts on meditation, film, dreams, the creative process, and a life spent pursuing mysteries."}, {"userName": "Leonardo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53031-leonardo", "userReview": "Read it in one 6 hour flight from LA to NY.Enjoyable and insightful.Mr. Lynch talks meditation, life and film."}, {"userName": "Tristan Alaba", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47093891-tristan-alaba", "userReview": "Great little collection of insights into the relationship between Lynch\u2019s meditation and creative practices - many valuable takeaways for me, and bonus points for the unified consciousness awareness, which is surprisingly rare to read from celebrated artists, yet a most pivotal point of progress for the upcoming century ~ recommended to artists, film fans, meditators and the cosmically inclined!"}, {"userName": "Inga Piz\u0101ne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52573959-inga-piz-ne", "userReview": "Liel\u0101 zivs dz\u012bvo tev\u012b.

The book itself feels somewhat dashed-off, nevertheless, I applaud Lynch's intentions. In the words of Burt Bacharach, \"What the world needs now, is meditation, sweet meditation.\" And the fruits thereof, clarity and compassion.As for the book itself, it's a golden nugget for fans. A kind of working manual for artists. A delicious inside look at an off-kilter mind \u2014 a highly successful off-kilter mind. I find the fragmentary, philosophical musing style of writing a deeply satisfying style. (See Nietzsche or Pascal.) Lynch's central view \u2014 that all is interconnected \u2014 is convincingly articulated here. He talks about making INLAND EMPIRE, saying, \"There couldn't be a fragment that doesn't relate to everything.\" That is a powerful and refreshing faith, and a crucial one for the artist. I also found Lynch's use of the word \"negativity\" noteworthy. In his view, the struggle is not against evil or suffering, but negativity. Through spiritual contemplation and positive action, Lynch argues, all negativity will recede. I believe in this view. Ultimately, a life is but a handful of stories, a pocketful of critical moments. Thus, Lynch gives us his life story in this book, in his fateful meeting with Fellini on his (Fellini's) deathbed, in his sit-down with his father and brother (who tell Lynch to get a job to support his family), in his stumbling upon the BOB character in Twin Peaks (who was played by a stagehand), and in his discovery of Transcendental Meditation, which provided the keystone to his philosophy, one that has enabled him to be creatively productive and successful. The book is a gem, maybe only for fans, or the like-minded. (Aren't all books gems only for the like-minded, though?) There are some boneheaded sentences in here, like \"Sleep is really important\", but there are also some thought-provoking reflections, such as, \"All religions flow ultimately to the one ocean\" (Is this true? Which ocean, the Indian Ocean?) and \"Don't even worry about the darkness\", a piece of advice I'm happy to hear from the man who made Blue Velvet."}], "description": "Where do ideas come from?In Catching the Big Fish, internationally acclaimed filmmaker David Lynch provides a rare window into his methods as an artist, his personal working style, and the immense creative benefits he has experienced from the practice of meditation.Lynch describes the experience of \"diving within\" and \"catching\" ideas like fish - and then preparing them for television or movie screens, and other mediums in which he works, such as painting, music, and design. Lynch writes for the first time about his more than three-decade commitment to Transcendental Meditation and the difference it has made in his creative process.In brief chapters, Lynch explains the development of his ideas - where they came from, how he grasps them, and which ones appeal to him the most. He specifically discusses how he puts his thoughts into action and how he engages with others around him. Finally, he considers the self and the surrounding world - and how the process of \"diving within\" that has so deeply affected his own work can directly benefit others.Catching the Big Fish comes as a revelation to the legion of fans who have longed to better understand Lynch's personal vision.
