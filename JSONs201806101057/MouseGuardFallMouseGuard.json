Though he hasn't been tested, is probably reading years ahead of whatever the standard metric is.Unfortunately, Sarah made one of the classic mistakes here, and judged a book by its cover. In fact, she made the mistake twice. 1. She assumed that because it was a comic, it was probably for kids.2. She assumed that a book with animal characters is for kids.This is a mistake that someone who has better comic literacy never would have made. If for not other reason than because they'd read Maus at some point in their lives.So on one hand, It wasn't a good choice, because it was too much for my little boy. (He read it just fine, but it was too violent for him, and I think the plot of treachery and betrayal was really beyond what he could understand.)But that doesn't mean it isn't a good book. It is. The art is great, and the comic paneling is excellent in a way that I couldn't have understood 5 years ago, before I'd read several thousand comics.So while it didn't strike home with my boy. It struck home with me. The story is strong, and the storytelling and art are truly beyond the pale. What's more, the story was legitimately heroic in ways that I've rarely experienced. The lion's share of the credit for this should go to the art and storytelling, but the fact that the story centers around mice is important, too. The smaller you are, the more bravery means. And you can't get much smaller than a mouse....So... yeah. I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 10 or so. But if you're older than that it's well-worth your time. Especially recommended for those of us who always loved Reepicheep, but wanted a whole book about him being a stone-cold badass."}, {"userName": "Jan Philipzig", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32295170-jan-philipzig", "userReview": "Looking at lavishly drawn and colored mice with swords was pleasant enough for a few pages, but I am afraid it only does so much for me. The high fantasy world of Mouse Guard feels underdeveloped and surprisingly generic underneath its furry surface - I got the impression that David Petersen was so keen on seeing his mice in action that he neglected the basics of fantasy storytelling, namely world building and character development."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41583-rebecca", "userReview": "Gorgeous book. The story owes a huge debt to Redwall, but the artwork is the real reason to read this book (and slowly). One review called the illustrations \"sumptuous,\" and I can't beat that word. The colors are lush and glowing, and pattern & texture are used to great effect to show depth and distance. I noticed that David Petersen earned his BFA in printmaking, which would explain the care taken in composing each panel. Even though these aren't prints, I can imagine that when you get in the habit of thinking in reverse images, it strengthens your compositions. Also, his line work reminded me of Barry Moser's prints. The Mouse Guard exists to provide safe journey and protection from one hidden mouse village to another. To a mouse, the entire world is full of predators. Just imagine how huge and terrifying it would be to battle a group of crabs...or a snake! (Some blood and violence...these are warrior mice.) The ancient and powerful weapon, the Black Axe, has fallen into the wrong hands. Will one of the Mouse Guard's own soon betray the Guard?The \"maps, guides, and assorted extras\" at the end fleshed out the mice's world and reminded me of the detail taken in imagining other worlds such as Dinotopia. (Dinosaurs...mice...I swear there is a connection.)"}, {"userName": "Nicholas Karpuk", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1574263-nicholas-karpuk", "userReview": "A book about warrior mice comes off as the sort of comedy comic I'd pick up in the 90's, flip through, and put back dismissively. There's been a certain disdain for talking animal comics among serious comic writers for about as long as the comic industry has existed in America.What sets Mouse Guard apart is that the creatures don't seem all that anthropomorphized. The author basically took a step back and observed that life for a mouse civilization would be much scarier and more difficult than an human society.The Mouse Guard are the most skilled and valorous members of mice society, who ensure that travel and trade is kept safe from city to city. How perilous their work is comes of in the sheer number of predators who attempt to make easy snacks out of them.I don't think a crab has ever been as menacing as the ones featured in this story. A character is nearly killed after successfully killing a snake from inside its mouth, and the menace of weasels, wolves, and owls are regularly mentioned. The overall atmosphere constantly reminds you that being a mouse is hard, brutal, and short.The only real issue I had is the length. I guess I expected more story from a graphic novel, and there are entire pages, sometimes a series of pages that do nothing more than show off style and artistry. As a result I felt like I was getting a small glimpse into what should have been a major conflict in their little, mousy world.Well worth reading, but expect a little lack of satisfaction at the end."}, {"userName": "St. Expeditus", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23734-st-expeditus", "userReview": "The artwork is magnificent. It's worth reading this book just for the pleasure of falling into its gorgeous pages. And the basic idea -- a civilization of mammals near the bottom of the food-chain -- is great (though hardly original). But not much is done with that idea after the first issue or two. In fact, the storytelling is pretty inept. There's very little world-building and almost no character development beyond sketchily rendered cliches. Without the text summaries at the start of each issue, the plot would be in trouble, because this book just doesn't do a good job of conveying the details of what's happening in the actual comic itself. The writing seems to be stuck in \"tell,\" rather than \"show.\" It makes it hard to care about the story or its outcome. But it's impossible not to give a couple of stars to the amazing art."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31814285-daniel", "userReview": "Vrlo lepa fantazijska prica o misevima koje se bore da prezive izadaju iz sopstvenih redova.

The sumptuous artwork glows with a warm color palette, as if the illustrations would drip from the pages, and the contrast of shadow and light make the images jump from the page.The main protagonists -- the mice who safeguard the villages within the border -- aren't rendered cutesy or cartoony. Who would have thought so much expression could be portrayed with beady, little eyes and nearly featureless, fur-covered faces? Yet Petersen succeeds in conveying emotion. The story reads all too brief, only because the world it inhabits seems as if it would have stories that could fill volumes. It's the perfect book for parents to share with their children and for fantasy fans of any age."}, {"userName": "Seth T.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/160319-seth-t", "userReview": "David Petersen's Mouseguard is a so-far-incredible series that pits medieval mice against both their common predators (snakes, owls, weasels, etc.) and their own kind. As the series is yet to be completed, it's hard to judge how well the series-as-whole will hold up\u2014but if Petersen continues to show the kind of storytelling attention and illustrator's care that we see in the first two volumes, the final result will be worthwhile indeed.With Fall 1152, Petersen introduces a world within (presumably) our world and goes beyond the realistic animal-fantasy honed in Richard Adams' \nWatership Down\n. Instead, this is a world in which mice have fostered a civilization, have made strides in both industry and academia. These mice boast metallurgy, pharmacy, architecture, libraries, cartography, and that hallmark of all the greatest civilizations, intrigue. There are castles and dungeons and cities hidden within trees. Wars and rumours of wars.(It is as yet unclear which other animals possess such social evolutions but at the least, we know that the weasels also use armour and weaponry.)Petersen spends much of the first volume introducing us to both his world and his characters (primarily, a trio of mice warriors, members of the vaunted mouseguard, whose purpose is to protect the commoner keeping the roads safe and keep peace between the very different (and fairly isolated) towns. Because so much of the volume is taken up with story-setting and world-building, it takes a little while for the main story to really get rolling. Once it does, however, Petersen's attention to his characters and their motivations and abilities is pushed even farther to the fore.Fall 1152 is a good introduction to what I hope will be a fantastic journey. The art and characterization is top-notch and the volume's only deficit is that its story does not seem quite full enough. This issue is of course resolved by the following volumes (if the second is anything to judge by) and the story continues to build there."}, {"userName": "James DeSantis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16060275-james-desantis", "userReview": "I tried to like this. I really did. My buddy told me it was great. I opened the book and right away liked the art. I told myself, hey, it's Mice. This could be good...IT COULD BE....but sadly it was not. The idea behind this is the mouse guard send out three warriors to find out what happened to a missing mouse. Death occurs and the big fallout happens where we have to find out why we have traitors in our midst! Then a side story of someone else meeting a old guy because...oh man I dunno. What I liked: The art. It's really cool and kind of messy, but it works well. I also thought one of the mouse guards was kind of cool, like a badass, who doesn't listen. What I didn't like: No character besides the one stuck out. The fights were hard to follow at times. The dialog was stiff and boring. I didn't care about the world building mostly because I didn't care about the mice. Overall this book just seems...boring? Yeah that's what I would use.

The amount of time it must have taken to perfectly craft the color and lines for every every panel is enormous. The characters and scenery are beautifully beautifully executed, and their drama is very real and comes to life as a result of the painstaking work of David Peterson.

The mice are portrayed in some strange land between cute and serious that is very enjoyable. Something about a mouse with a sword. It's nice. But unfortunately the writing is pretty bad. Several of the moments in the book that should have given the author an opportunity to explore, instead were highly derivative. When a mouse is caught inside a besieged town, the general proclaims that it is not them who is trapped inside with the enemy, it is the enemy who is trapped with them. A naked reference to Watchmen that borders on plagiarism. The book ends with the phrase \"Winter is coming,\" swiped from the pages of George R.R. Martin. Now you might argue that these are references, but it's more than that. When you take a line for its dramatic strength, you steal that line. When you reference it to create something new, then you have used it appropriately. It was too difficult to get over the bad writing, which is unfortunate because the artwork and the characters were fun."}, {"userName": "Burt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/286882-burt", "userReview": "I don't like anthropomorphic stories. The Secret of NIMH never did it for me. I never finished Watership Down. Animal Farm was way too clever and even its political similies were lost on me when I was 15. I have seen and heard and spoken with Brian Jaques, but I haven't cracked the cover of Redwall yet.Lieam, Saxon, and Kenzie are the primary characters of Mouse Guard and they are, yes, mice. So are Gwendolyn and Sadie and Conrad. Ditto Celanawe. Mice. I hate stories with mice in them.But not this one. Mouse Guard is both gripping and visually gorgeous. I love good line and David Peterson knows how to throw lines together. His coloration captures fall perfectly with its browns, oranges, reds. Mouse Guard is a beautiful book.I am in the midst right now of lightnening my house by the removal of books. This one stays. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

I just think the story he was trying to tell was a little more epic than he gave himself room for.
