The first page is missing.- the female protagonist is a mute, irish, punk rock teenager who leaves out the verb \"to be\" in her (written) conversation. - there is a dog. named \"help.\"- there is a ghostthis is just begging me to call \"quirky manic pixie dream girl po-mo wannabe hipster kitchen sink bullshit!\" on its ass, but i can't. because i was utterly charmed. this isn't some lisbeth salander alienating fantasy girl character; niamh is a spunky little thing, yes, but she's also incredibly endearing, and a real, developed character instead of just a collage of unusual attributes for the male protag to bounce off of. and help's name is fitting within the context of the story. as for the layout, it felt entirely appropriate to me, and the bits and pieces contributed to the narrative in a wholly appropriately-structured way, in a similar fashion to Night Film. it's still a tough sell, because at the end of the day it is basically a haunted house story. a gimmicky haunted house story full of cryptography, puzzles, and wordplay, which would call to mind House of Leaves, but unlike House of Leaves, it doesn't use its gimmicks as a crutch, and they aren't \"hey, you will need a mirror to read this chapter!\" or \"time to rotate the book! isn't this a fun and unusual thing i am making you do to make sure you remember that you are an active participant in this game we call reading?? whe!\" it is, instead, a very charming gimmicky haunted house story, and the gimmicks are fun and playful and not bleak and distancing like House of Leaves. it's an engaging adventure book which could be friends with Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore or The Shadow of the Wind, one that scoops you up, promises you a fun time, and actually delivers on its promise. it's a little bit gothic novel, a little bit treasure hunt adventure, a little bit dreamscape fantasy, with shades of the traditional victorian orphan-narrative, and a little secret society codex drama. and that ghost.and the secret magic of books...I've noticed all manuscripts are bad; any book randomly opened in a friend's house is good; the same book in a bookstore is bad. When this story is completed, that beginning will turn better.fun fun fun. great cover, great book - i am a million percent in love."}, {"userName": "Mohammed Arabey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04,

super fun. If you like books that are told in unique formats, then you'll probably enjoy this one. It's like Night Film and National Treasure and a gothic horror story all rolled into one really fast-paced, mystery novel. I don't want to explain the premise at all because I went into this one knowing absolutely nothing about it and it definitely enhanced my reading experience. But I will say, the ending was a bit anticlimactic for me. I was expecting something a lot grander and more fleshed out, but it seemed a bit rushed and I had quite a few questions left at the end.

If i could, i'd give the first 300+ pages of this book five stars, because i loved it from the absolute get-go. I loved everything about it--the concept, the structure, the characters, the narrative choices, the use of language, everything. I read the damn thing at a racing clip, nonstop.But, the last 30 or so pages, it all fell in on itself like a house of cards with a pile of shit in the middle. I categorically began to hate it, and i can't really explain why without copious spoilers, but let's just say that in the theatre, we'd say that it challenged the suspension of disbelief. Stuff just got too absurd, too fast, with too little justification for such extreme ridiculum. I suppose it could be chalked up to an attempt at a turbo-gotcha of a plot twist, but if that was the goal, it failed. Still, i had such a great time reading the whole first 300+ pages that i can't pan the book, or give it a single star or anything, because i completely loved it, up until it disappointed me so deeply that if it were my boyfriend, i'd break up with it.

Give me transcripts, articles, excerpts from (real or fake) reference books, and it's more than likely that I'll love it (some recent examples being The Three or Night Film). This one in particular is stuffed to the brim with all of the above, and more. There are even numerous clues and puzzles presented, none of which I actually had the brainpower to solve, but they make such a fun little treasure hunt whether they're crack-able or not. The Supernatural Enhancements starts off a little strange - the beginning is a bit confusing and formal, and I had to re-read the first page a few times before I totally understood what was going on. But it's only uphill from there - soon I was totally engrossed in the mysterious and at times creepy world of Axton House. A - whose full name is never disclosed - inherits a magnificent and macabre estate from long-lost relative Ambrose Wells, whom he didn't even know existed, and decides to immediately move in with his companion, lovably spunky teenager Niamh. The events of the novel are primarily told through A's diary, video and audio transcripts from the equipment A and his sidekick, Niamh, use to bug and monitor the house, notes passed between A and Niamh (she's mute), and letters to Aunt Liza. Axton House is, of course, haunted, but that's not even the main plot - that honour belongs to the group of men Ambrose was associated with before his death and their unusual activities.I often find that these types of books have unbelievably intriguing premises and then aren't able to follow through with them, but that is simply not the case here. There are several huge plot twists and unexpected reveals that actually make sense in the context of the novel and make you go \"whaaa?!\" without the often inevitable \"but wait...\"The one thing I wasn't hugely fond of were the dreams. Dream sequences in books (or hearing about people's dreams in real life) have just never interested me, and although they did have some plot significance here, I couldn't help but skim through.The Supernatural Enhancements is almost like a children's novel for adults - so much fun, so quirkily gothic, so satisfying. There's just enough gimmick to make it something a little bit different, but not enough to mask a weak plot or undeveloped characters (you'll find neither of those here!)

This story was totally my style.It gave me that giddy feeling that you get when you first start a book and you realize you're going to love it.An odd yet lovable twenty-something European kid inherits a fortune from a distant American relative, along with an old mansion steeped in mystery and haunted by a dark past. He is joined by an equally eccentric companion, a bright young woman who is mute (due to unknown childhood emotional trauma) and communicates solely through writing and gestures. They explore the mansion, determined to uncover the secrets of its former owners, and stumble upon something quite unusual.The story is composed of mostly excerpts from letters, dream journals, and sound/video recordings. There are puzzles and codes galore, making this such a fun read.It's a bit reminiscent of The Shining and House of Leaves, but not quite as terrifying and not quite so dark. It goes off in its own direction, and has a great sense of humor.Side note: That library in Axton House sounds awesome. Where can I get myself one of those??

As soon as I got it in the mail, I dove into it... hoping for a good tale.This does have hints of the gothic/supernatual in it but the mystery part is more present with the supernatural stuff a sort of footnote in the background. The mystery was well done, unveiled somewhat slowly but it kept my attention.Clues are gathered and revealed via letters, diary entries, articles, and so on. A couple times the 'excerpts/articles' got on my nerves but other than that I enjoyed the way everything unfolded. Niamh and A. I enjoyed getting to know, watching them grow closer and unraveling the secrets and mysteries of Ambrose and the house. The history of the house was interesting and I wish we had gone deeper into it, it would have added more darkness to the story but it might not have fit with the pacing as well perhaps (I would welcome an ebook please ;-) *hint hint*). As for the horror elements, there are some but (and maybe this is just me) it didn't 'scare' me too much. It was chilling certainly in spots but there was 'something' missing, that extra kick... if you want to call it that. The story takes its time to set up but keeps a good pace, I was never bored or tempted to DNF at all. After about a little over the halfway point , it became very hard for me to put down (if I had been home, I would have finished it in one day... damn work lol).What it all ended up being about and what 'the meetings' at the house was both fascinating and creepy. Even after Caleb explained things I still thought these guys were off their rockers.The ending before the ending (that make sense haha) was shocking and I couldn't read the pages fast enough. One part had me mentally cheering when the ghost did something to help. I was anxious for one other person but also relieved at the end.The style did remind me of Mister Zafon in the way he set up the story and the atmospheric quality of everything. He's got a good talent here and I can't wait to see what he does next as he continues to grow as a writer.The ending had a couple surprises in it and had me laughing a bit.

Speaking of which, I have heard of encrypting letters during wars, but I never knew the types and how to do it. It was quite fascinating to learn a little history about it and know how to encrypt and decrypt letters for future reference (you never know). Trying to figure out the clues made me feel like Nancy Drew or one of the Hardy boys. Or think of Blue's Clues lolI could barely figure out what clue led to what. Usually I am very good at solving riddles or figuring out the clues before the characters do, but this book left me stumped. I enjoyed the brain challenge. The dialogue was pretty interesting between Niamh and A. I have never met a mute person, so it was interesting reading the communication between Niamh and other characters.The red herring and twist at the end definitely got me; I really didn't see it coming, which is surprising to me.

But oh, this cover....I HAD to get the book just for that. Of course, I looked at the description--a mysterious suicide and a haunted house? I'm in.It started off okay. At first I wasn't sure I was going to be able to deal with the way the story is told. The journal entries didn't bother me--they read basically like first person prose. The notes back and forth between A. and Niamh were effective and really brought Niamh to life for me (I completely adored her). But the surveillance video descriptions bugged me in the beginning.Then, something happened. I realized: This is NOT a ghost story. It's a mystery. And the author was doing things that soon had me completely entangled--he was creating characters I really, really liked, dropping clues at the perfect pace, and playing on my total geek side with investigations into encrypted codes and..... Before long, the video and audio transcription parts were suddenly more captivating than regular prose would have been.A quick aside: The style of the book was not the only oddity. The voice was very different, too. It takes place in the 1990's but it felt like a much earlier time period. Had you taken out the pop culture references, it would have easily fit in as taking place in the 1920's. I think it totally worked for me, though.What I'm not entirely sure about is the ending. I can't quite place my finger on what exactly bothers me about it. A little too fast compared to the pacing of the rest of the novel? The twist a little too far out? I'm not entirely sure, but I closed the book a bit disappointed in the ending. However--I am tempted to read it again simply because of the ending, in search of hints that might make it more meaningful to me.That last said, I definitely recommend the book.

How could it sink that low?That\u2019s how I used to feel, bound by reason to boredom. And then along came Axton House.\u2019\nThe main character, known only as \u201cA.\u201d inherits Axton House, a mansion in American, after a second-cousin twice removed by the name of Ambrose Wells commits suicide by throwing himself from his bedroom window. Strangely enough, Ambrose\u2019s father died the same way. At the same age. A. travels to America to get his affairs in order and with him comes Niamh, a mute teenager who communicates throughout the novel via notepad. The two soon immerse themselves in the mystery of the house which they find involves a secret society and many mysterious coded messages.The Supernatural Enhancements is a Gothic mystery with a sole ghost and a strange sense of eclecticism. Unfortunately, it ranks right up there for me with The Quick in terms of absolute pointlessness. The story is told through various means including audio and video recordings, A\u2019s day to day diary and a most disturbing dream journal, letters to an \u2018Aunt Liza\u2019, as well as various excerpts from books that they use in their research. It definitely had a Night Film feel regarding the unique way of telling the story but the story itself bounced around far too much and left far too much confusion in its wake. The strange codes that the two must unravel in order to progress further in solving the mystery should have been fun but instead I found them to be a tedious addition since us as readers had little to no chance of solving them ourselves so the pages and pages of detail regarding how they solved it only resulted in causing me a headache of epic proportions.The characters themselves were mysterious and quirky but not in the most appealing way. We\u2019re given very little detail on the two (other than the fact that they\u2019re X-File fans which should have caused me to like them on that principle alone, but no) or anything about A. (or why he\u2019s only referred to as A. because that\u2019s just weird) or Niamh and their strange relationship; only that Niamh likes A. but she\u2019s underage so it\u2019s pointless. Or so we\u2019re led to believe. The two sleep in a bed described as \u201cbig enough for each of us to throw an orgy without her guests disturbing mine\u201d. And she apparently sleeps there because she\u2019s there to protect him, which makes total sense.Actually, it never ends up making sense. None of it does. The characters don\u2019t make sense nor their purpose, the bad guys, or this secret society. The mysteries are seemingly explained but in a quick and careless way that is meant to be quirky and interesting but left much to be desired. The Supernatural Enhancements had a promising initial feel that, as Rory put, felt like \u201ca lighthearted, simpler cousin\u201d to The House of Leaves \u2014 just minus the use of mirrors. It regrettably fell flat for me.I received this book free from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

If he can spend basically all of his time making up ciphers and making international phone calls, he could spend some time a) asking his fellow society members on the phone what they think of this bizarre experience and b) bending his brain to figuring that out. Why does he end up jumping out the window? At the same age that Horace did? That explanation sucked.- A team of professional, hired assassins has no problem shooting 18 people in their beds without anyone waking up (??!?), but they have a huge problem accurately shooting the two protagonists in the head. Yeah okay.- If Niamh is there to \"protect\" A., then I would have expected better credentials than right place, right time for a terrorist bomb.- The Ngara girl/ghost plays such a key role in the first part of the book and is the reason that the Wells own Axton House, but fades away as a complete afterthought once the book does its 180 twist. So ??????- What does the Orb do for the rest of the year? Sits around and shocks people?Probably the most disappointing letdown of the book was the fact that this society literally does nothing with the information that they get from the Eye. They've managed somehow to classify all 20 people along a theme, but are content to just find 5-6 of them a year. Once they do find them, they're somehow satisfied! UGH.

Along with his mute teenage companion, Niamh, they move to Virginia, taking up residence in the house and begin to unravel the secrets surrounding the mysterious demise of his distant cousin and the secret society that he was part of.I loved the gimmick of this story, it's told through the use of diary entries, letters to Aunt Liz, audio recordings, notes, diagrams and video recordings. I've enjoyed other stories read using the epistolary format so this engaged me from the start. There's quite a lot going on, it's not a book you can skim and you'd be likely to miss important detail. That being said some of the cipher/code material was a bit tiresome and I did find it dragging through these parts but they weren't long so didn't really affect the read too much.Character wise, I like both A. and Niamh. Even though you never find out A's name he's a likeable character and someone that was easy to root for. Niamh is mute but the author has no difficulty infusing a strong personality into her character, she is a strong female presence in the novel, smart, tough and hell bent on getting her own way, I liked her a lot. The story itself starts off as a mystery, with A and Niamh trying to figure out what happened to the A's relative and finding out a bit more about the secret society he was involved in, at the beginning a ghost makes an appearance and it looks as though it will be a large part of the coming storyline. This is when the book took another turn and it evolved into a treasure hunt with the main characters looking for clues, deciphering codes and trying to work out more about who the other parties in the society were. Not what I was expecting but engrossing none the less. That being said I was slightly disappointed the ghost didn't make more of an impact in the story.Unique, fast paced, great characters and a lot of fun to read.

Of course the story itself interested me (why would I request it if it didn't?), but when I noticed it was told through journal entries, Blair Witch style camera footage, and letters, my excitement was dampened. This isn't a writing style I'm fond of. There have been a couple exceptions, but these books usually end up as DNFs or 1 Star reads. In this case, I can't wait to throw my money at Amazon for a hardcover copy.A is a young Englishman who has just been left a house, and a fortune, in VA by a second cousin twice removed. Seeing as A never knew his cousin, Ambrose, existed, he is understandably surprised by this. A and his mute, teenage companion, Niamh, set off to claim his inheritance. It doesn't take long to figure out all is not right with Axton House, and that's not counting the ghost haunting the bathroom. A starts having nightmares, only they aren't like any nightmares he has ever had before. These feel real. Someone breaks into Ambrose's office. The safe has been opened and the contents left inside. What was the thief looking for? They find coded messages Ambrose wanted sent to friends. What do they say? Why are all the names also coded? Was he a Mason? Was he part of a cult? Why did he have a huge gathering every December 21st? Why did all the servants have to leave the property before the guest arrived? What caused Ambrose to throw himself out of a window, just like his father had?This started out a little slow, but by 10% I was hooked. I honestly loved everything about this title. The characters were well developed. Niamh has joined my all time favorite characters. The setting is deliciously creepy. The supernatural elements creeped me the fuck out. The mystery kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. Buy it, borrow it from the library, do whatever you need to do to get your hands on this book.

The cheese stands alone? Here are my thoughts after finishing it just a half hour ago. I had trouble with the execution. I actually had trouble following the action at times and got a bit confused. The story is laid out with quite a few different methods in telling the story. Diary entries, notes, letters, etc. The main female character is mute which only adds to the discophany as he would talk at her and she would hold up a 3 or 4 word scribble. I also think that probably because the story was laid out in different methods of information, I never felt that I knew the two main characters. They just seemed like cardboard cut outs rather than real people caught in surreal circumstances. Without giving any specifics for those who haven't read it, I thought I was reading a haunted house story for the longest time. It is only in the most marginal of ways a haunted house story. Rather than feeling enchanted or that the author was clever when all was revealed, I felt a bit like the rug had been pulled out from under me. Of all the books I have read so far this year, I enjoyed this one the least.

I am definitely the latter.This is the second book I've picked up at the library this year with a really pretty, cool looking cover. I am never going to make that mistake again. Both of them are HUGE letdowns.It's told through various mediums - security footage (why security footage of all things?), a dream journal, letters, conversations recorded by the mute character (which I was soooooo not ok with in any way shape or form but more on that later), etc. I seem to be in the minority about this particular storytelling technique. This method is usually cool in theory, but it's difficult to pull off. If the writer doesn't utilize them in the clearest and most economical way, all it does is confuse the reader and muddle the story - creating extra crap where there shouldn't be any. That's exactly what happens here. There is just so much format switching that it's usually not clear what's going on, where they are, or even who is speaking. And that makes the story BORING because eventually you just stop paying attention.I initially took my time in reading it, but I realized a couple of days ago that if I was going to push through it, I'd have to do it in one sitting, otherwise there was no way I'd be able to keep any of this information straight.I picked this up because it's sold as a haunted house story. It certainly looks like a haunted house story. But it's only marginally a haunted house story. There are so many different ways to utilize a huge, old, gothic style manor where people tend to kill themselves. And yet...there's really not a whole lot of paranormal stuff going on. And the explanation for it was such a let down.And then there is Niamh, the mute, teenage, female companion of our protagonist. Both her and her relationship with A are huge red flags for me. And the more I read, the more uncomfortable I seemed to become about it. I really had a problem with the main female character being so young and mute on top of it. When she and A talk, she scribbles on a notepad her responses to whatever he's saying. Why no sign language? Oh that's right - because it's easier to write dialogue without describing the gestures and tone that go with it. Languages aren't just words on a page. There is an audible and physical component to them. That is what is usually referred to as a cop out, but I think \"lazy\" is the better term. She also spoke poor english (at least at first, and the author has the courtesy to explain it) which, as I got through more of the book, seemed like an excuse to make A seem older, and an authorial excuse to patronize her. These little idiosyncrasies are not endearing or mysterious...they rob an important character of her voice and some of her credibility. I take MAJOR ISSUE with that.Ugh and don't even get me started on the ending.

The device, where a story is told via a montage of variably trustworthy letters, journal entries, newspaper clippings, etc., been used by many authors to better effect. (Stoker's \"Dracula,\" Shelley's \"Frankenstein,\" and Collins' \"The Moonstone\" are a just a few classics that leap immediately to mind.) Cantero's effort to tread in those well-worn footprints is not an abject failure, but readers are justified wondering why the author elected to tell the story this way. The plot and setting, and the characters that populate them, are all sufficiently intriguing to hold interest on their own merits without resort to gratuitous epistolary gymnastics. Cantero's choice of narrative technique detracts, often materially, from what could otherwise be a solidly gripping paranormal mystery."}, {"userName": "Melissa McShane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1329059-melissa-mcshane", "userReview": "It was interesting enough that I'm not going to give it a starred rating despite not finishing it (I gave it 150 pages), but I kept having the feeling that it was trying to be cleverer than it is.

I'm going to say the same about this book right off the bat. I'm not sure what it is about these books these days, or if I'm just too old and curmudgeonly at my ripe age of 39 to care about any of it, or what, but these books appear to be written by and for people who have no attention span.This entire book is what we would call \"epistolary\" because it is told through a series of documents, rather than a traditional narrative. This is fine - it has worked in oodles of literature over the years, like Dracula - but it is nothing but a distraction here. I gave no fucks about any of these characters because there was nothing that happened to give me any reason to feel connection to any of them. The story bounces between A.'s (the 23-year-old male protagonist) diary entry, letters to \"Aunt Liza\", notes written by the mute 16-year-old Irish \"guardian\" to A., Niamh, dream journal, video recording, audio recording, telegrams, postcards, excerpts from other books, and lord knows I'm probably forgetting others. In other words, it bounced around too much and much too quickly, so I never was drawn into the story. This sort of technique can work (when done well and skillfully) but in this case it appeared lazy and uninspired.And, dare I say it yet again, like someone is just waiting for the movie to be made.You remember how the Paranormal Activity movies were sort of a big deal when they started because of the cameras in the house telling the story to make you feel like you were really there, or whatever, or we can even go back to Blair Witch Project with the handheld camera. But the point is that in those scenarios, the perspective worked. It doesn't work as well in text, but whenever the movie gets made I'm sure it will work out better.I had trouble understanding what was really happening. This is not because I'm a bad reader, but because of the frenetic pace and style of the story, I had a shit-ton difficulty understanding what was the point or what I should be looking at. It starts out appearing to be a paranormal story which is great, but then there's this secret society - also great! But then this secret message and cipher thing which, on its own, is also great, but now we have so many layers to this story and it's all just one giant red herring and makes me not care at all about what is really behind the weirdness in this Axton House.And because I had trouble connecting, I then had difficulty with what may or may not have been a throwaway plot point: the therapist, Dr. Vanessa Belknap tells A. that she is a Freemason. Um. This isn't to say that women can't be Masons, but there's more to it than that - they are not recognized by other Masons generally as being Masons, so while that comment thrown in rather unnecessarily might have been interesting, it never really went anywhere and, again, just felt like sloppy writing.Basically, there's too much happening here. Pick one or two things and run with it. You don't have to put every awesome idea you've ever had since you've been alive into one novel, for crying out loud. Just try to make the one novel something interesting all the way through.As a side note, I did not like the portrayal of Niamh and her relationship with A. She is a deaf-mute and chooses to use a notepad to convey her thoughts instead of everyone learning sign language, I guess, because that's not fun or easy. And, I don't know, the relationship rubbed me the wrong way. She's a \"guardian\" to A., but what does that even mean, and why did she choose him, and why are they sleeping in the same bed anyway. She runs around in her underwear too much, whether by choice or because something has happened that she just can't wear her clothes right then. Maybe if the story didn't bounce around between all these different recordings and perspectives that might have come together better, but cheese and rice, was it fucking annoying.I do, however, love the name Niamh. Unfortunately she's a young punk girl with an acquired disability that is somehow meant to make A.'s life better. You know what that sounds like to me? A manic-pixie dream girl. Ew. Just ew.This was a drag for me to read. I was mostly on board with most of it, and could even say to myself that's okay if it's not amazing, as long as it's interesting, but then it stopped being interesting because of all the different angles and directions. Then it became a chore and I couldn't wait to be finished with it.But that cover really is nice."}, {"userName": "Lilyn G. | Sci-Fi & Scary", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33783014-lilyn-g-sci-fi-scary", "userReview": "DNF'ed at 25% - The mute girl noting where every conversation happens feels unrealistic.

Not in the way you meant that day, when you said that a passenger on a ship doesn't see the ropes the way a sailor sees them.

Having seen the house would mean to understand the use of each room and each piece of furniture. We haven't seen the house. We have merely perceived a circular sequence of empty halls, large windows, fireplaces, chandeliers, spiderwebs, canopies, and a cluttered desk on every floor.

Hooray!)There are plenty of elements here that could be very annoying depending on your pet peeves list, and a couple of seams show (such as a slight lack of familiarity with certain American legal issues), and it has one of those wonderful endings that, let's say, leave more questions than answers (sequel, please!).

While this may sound gimmicky -- it is gimmicky -- it faded to the background very quickly to me. This surprised me as I thought it would be tough to read something in this format, especially because the novel literally starts in the middle of a sentence. But it genuinely works for this story, so let's move on.The story that is told is a new-weird/horror/mystery amalgam that hooked me very early and delivered through the end. Despite being set in 1995 Virginia, a gothic mood palpable, and as is often the case, the spooky Axton House almost becomes a character itself. There are very few actual characters other than protagonists A. and his \"companion\" Niamh, and very little is learned about these characters either, other than the fact they like The X-Files, so anyone seeking a character study can look elsewhere. But the mystery is compelling, as is the cryptography mentioned that A. and Niamh employ to discover what exactly is going on in the recently inherited estate.

After all, he never even knew he had a \"second cousin, twice removed\" in America, much less that the eccentric gentleman had recently committed suicide by jumping out of the third floor bedroom window\u2014at the same age and in the same way as his father had before him . . .Together, A. and Niamh quickly come to feel as if they have inherited much more than just a rambling home and a cushy lifestyle. Axton House is haunted, they know it, but that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the secrets they slowly but surely uncover. Why all the suicides?

And what of the rumors in town about a mysterious gathering at Axton House on the night of the winter solstice?Told vividly through a series of journal entries, scrawled notes, recovered security footage, letters to Aunt Liza, audio recordings, complicated ciphers, and even advertisements, Edgar Cantero has written a dazzling and original supernatural adventure featuring classic horror elements with a Neil Gaiman-ish twist.", "title": "The Supernatural Enhancements", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18782854-the-supernatural-enhancements", "average": 3.63, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1391307741l/18782854.jpg", "reviews": 975, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2876313.Edgar_Cantero", "name": "Edgar Cantero"}], "type": ["Horror", "Mystery", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18782854-the-supernatural-enhancements", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21793065-the-supernatural-enhancements", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20890013-the-supernatural-enhancements", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25136564-el-factor-sobrenatural", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32905343-meddling-kids", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38350571-this-body-s-not-big-enough-for-both-of-us", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13504886-vallvi", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6338470-dormir-amb-winona-ryder", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22376941-baileys-n-coke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193858-the-cuckoo-s-calling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
