Oh my lord... do I like this??? Okay. Word of warning: don't bother reading this unless you KNOW your mythology, and I'm not just talking about the greeks. There's a boatload of Sumerian in here, as well. Each and every city is appropriate. Each and every name is square on the mark. This book is brilliant. BRILLIANT. It shines with Radiance.Okay. Now down to the nitty-gritty. We slide easily between motion picture scripting and stream of consciousness, with a few actual epistles thrown in. It's accomplished and speaks of a grand familiarity with traditional mainstream fiction, even going so far as to rise as high as any of the past masters. Don't be fooled into thinking that because this is SF that it is anything less than masterful. I'm going to have to read this one several more times to pick up everything, but even on my first quick read, I picked up more than enough to shiver with delight and drool from both sides of my mouth because I am, essentially, a level-headed person.One thing that is common upon practically every level of this read, and the title gives it away. Radiance. It's all about bringing forth the best version through the magic of light.You can read this story from the surface, getting into the magical mystery of Severin and her disappearance, or the magic of moviemaking, but all of that's just the easy route. Another route is to read between the lines, to see that every person and every place is pure metaphor that work, time and time again, to bolster the initial and ongoing themes of bringing meaning out of death, magic out of life, and raising the standard of understanding everything else with eyes as sharp as the sun. All the artists in this book are on a quest to bring their Art to the next level, and none of them are failures. They are the embodiment of beauty-crafting, myth-building, and obsession. Percival and Severin is a perfect example.An entirely different level of this same theme caught my attention right off the bat and turned me into a giddy mess. Ms. Valente turned our solar-system into a heaven and a haven, the best of all possible worlds, a place where everyone and everything could survive, custom-made to support life and happiness. I think of all the pulp SF out there, not forgetting Burroughs or Bradbury, that had lush life on Venus and Mars. Of course, she took it much farther. Mercury had it's own unique species, as did Jupiter and Saturn, their moons, and all the way to Pluto and Charon, which had a huge vegetable stalk connecting the two moonlets together in an endless dance, with strange cows and lotus flowers ready to provide life and sustenance for humans when they arrived. It was gorgeous. It was a dream come true, and artistic rendering that turned our hellish system into a horn of plenty, and yes, everywhere was giving us air to breathe. This, too, was the artist giving us a brilliant conception of the world through the Fae Light of movie magic, and I admit that I fell into its spell as deeply and completely as any of the very best books I've ever read. It was told so well that I drowned in not giving a fuck about having realistic science. This was all about dreams and magic, as only our deepest joys of a mythical hollywood could conceive.Is this enough to propel you to a wonderful reading experience? I hope so. But wait... I haven't even mentioned the Callowhales. And I won't. They're very important, and increasingly so. This is one of the best books I've ever read. Maybe it just speaks to me, and me alone, because I love complicated flights of immense imagination, detailed with such density and beauty that I was forced to slow the hell down and savour each word, each turn of phrase, each reference. Was I doubly amazed by the structure of the read when scenes replayed themselves as to throw all of my ideas about what I was reading into entirely new light? Hells yes. The writing was masterful. I know I said that before. I'm saying it again because I have to sit back down with this book, SOON, and study it. I WANT to study it. It is so damn rich as to turn practically everything else I read into shallow piles of doo. :)I can't believe this is just the first novel I've read of hers. I've been hearing about her works for years, and yet I just never got around to reading any of them. I wanted to. I really did, but something always got in the way. I seem to be saying that a lot about a handful of authors, recently. Well I'm FIXING THAT. I'm going to be reading the rest of her works very soon. No one that can write like this should ever be dismissed or ignored.

Thus begins the meta-fictional odyssey into Severin Unck's life and fate. Radiance is the story of Severin Unck's life (and death?), told by Severin and the people who knew her in the form of articles, journal entries, scripts, and films, most notably Severin's own. I was apprehensive at first, since this sounds like a first class ticket to fancy-pants town, like a lot of books that use meta-fictional devices. However, Catherynne Valente can get into my fancy pants any day.Told in a non-linear fashion, Radiance tells the story of Severin Unck through interviews and films of the people who knew her, from her father, Percival Unck and his seven ex-wives, to Erasmo St. John, her last lover, to Anchises St. John, the little boy who was the only survivor of the Adonis colony on Venus. Unlike a lot of literature that uses meta-fiction to tell the tale, the techniques are actually relevant to the story.The setting is an enjoyable one, one where space travel was mastered decades earlier and every planet and moon in the solar system is habitable. Colonization is depended on monstrous Venusian beasts called callowwhales. Because of the tyranny of the Edisons, everyone is still making silent movies, making for a very unique setting indeed. There's not a whole lot more I want to say about the plot. Catherynne Valente shows her writing chops in this outing, going from sf to screenplay to soap opera to noir, and all points beyond, without missing a beat. I'd read a library of Madame Mortimer mysteries.4.5 out of 5 stars.

And I\u2019m not even saying anything. I\u2019m not talking about my films, I\u2019m not talking about my life, and I\u2019m not talking about the world. And yet, the media will print it simply because I said it. And at this moment in time, I bet there is an artist around the corner of this hotel, on the street, with a mind far beyond ours, but we will never listen to him simply because he has not appeared in a movie.He goes on to say, \u201cAnd that is what is fucked up about our culture,\u201d but that\u2019s not the point I\u2019m trying to make.Instead, I\u2019d like to appreciate for a moment the popularity of celebrities and the compelling nature of fiction in general. We all have known the experience of watching a film and finding ourselves on the edge of our seats, empathizing with the characters. This, even though we know that they are just actors, in NO DANGER whatsoever, and that, even if \u201cbased on a true story,\u201d what\u2019s actually happening on the screen is an artificial construct, no more real than a golem\u2019s dream. Yet there we are, caring. Somehow these characters in their imaginary worlds approximate truth in a way that actual reality, confusing and indeterminate as it is, cannot.Many people, particularly a certain stripe of intellectual, would call us fools and escapists, mere addicts of the phantasmagorical. I know a fellow who foreswore all fiction and instead dedicated himself exclusively to documentary film and non-fiction books (and also joined a nudist colony). David Foster Wallace in his essay E Unibus Pluram suggested our television obsession causes a chain reaction of disassociation in which American fiction writers get their dosage of reality from fiction \u2013 which is itself written by personages who have based their reality on consumed fiction \u2013 thereby creating a recursive spiral down the rabbit hole, until what we think is reality is not real but an infinitely regressed, telephone-game garbled version of it.Even if I were to agree in principle, I would not agree in sentiment. I think humanity\u2019s capacity for empathy is nothing short of amazing.I'd say that when we engage in narrative, we are exercising our empathy muscles. All forms of narrative do this, but the intimate nature of written literature does it best. A good book \u2013 with complex, diverse characters and morally gray situations \u2013 is the empathy version of a Crossfit workout. As such, I\u2019d claim that readers are, if not the best people in the world, at least the most empathetic. I believe our pathetic little meatsack hearts, brimming with narrative and character, carry on the great work of humanity in a way that the mighty wielders of the sword and the hammer and the abacus do not. I say that the greatest and most beautiful machine or theory, wielded without empathy, is not only inhuman, but antihuman.Alas, Radiance demands little exercise of our empathy muscles (or perhaps too much). It\u2019s not that it doesn\u2019t contain complex characters, morally gray situations, or a great imagination, but that they are not presented in an engaging manner. Instead the author utilizes language, structure, genre, and form as ends unto themselves, rather than as means to an end (that end typically being the exploration of humanity). Put simply, the author Catherynne Valente wanted to eat her cake and have it too. To quote from an interview she had with John Scalzi:I\u2019m not going to lie. This book is crazypants. I threw everything I had into it. Heart and soul and probably some cartilage and eyeball fluid, too. I wanted to write a melodrama about a wild, living and breathing and squabbling Solar System. I wanted to write a horror-romance about huge, elemental aliens. I wanted to write a non-linear postmodern SF novel that was also a page-turning thriller because I secretly always wanted to write a hardboiled noir murder mystery. I wanted to write a badass adventure about film patents. I wanted to write a book about movies. About seeing and being seen. About what the camera does to us when it never leaves our side. About who has the right to speak, and who has to buy it. About the meaning of science fiction in a science fictional universe. And through it all I wanted to write about a lost girl who didn\u2019t come home. It all hangs together, I promise!Alas, Catherynne Valente, you\u2019ve made a promise you couldn\u2019t keep. Not for this reader at least. It doesn\u2019t hang together. It\u2019s too much in too little space. Worse, you\u2019ve committed the one sin no author \u2013 whether her book is a non-linear postmodern narrative or not \u2013 can commit: you didn\u2019t give us a reason to care.Now those who do like this book might argue that I\u2019m committing the affective fallacy. That I\u2019m critiqueing a piece of literature based on how it makes us FEEL (as opposed to what it makes us think). They would trumpet the book\u2019s non-linear narrative and metafictional elements as an explicit choice that may make the book more difficult to read but that is NECESSARY to the story\u2019s ultimate purpose: To explore the subjective nature of reality, and of film\u2019s intersections with it, and the methods and consequences of how and where we choose to focus the spotlights of our eyeballs, ears, and minds.I would counter that not all non-linear narratives are created equal. Even if the mere EXISTENCE of a non-linear narrative OUGHT to tell us the author is trying to make some metafictional comment about genre or narrative, that doesn\u2019t mean she actually accomplished her aims. I\u2019d go further still: even the ACCOMPLISHMENT of these aims wouldn\u2019t necessarily make the book worth reading. Instead, each reader must ultimately ask him or herself, is the metafictional exploration of genre worth reading if the author has failed to provide a compelling underpinning of humanity?My complete lack of engagement with this novel would answer a resounding NO.But do not mistake this as MERELY an opposition to postmodern fiction. True enough I consider postmodern lit a form of intellectual masturbation, but a 1-star rating from me is an even greater condemnation. I think Radiance is a particularly bad example of post-modern lit.By way of contrast, I\u2019d bring up Italo Calvino\u2019s post-modern book If On A Winter\u2019s Night a Traveler. That book is in many ways as difficult and experimental as Radiance. But I love it. I love it because underpinning its non-linear structure is a humor and keen sense of the absurd that give readers a reason to care.More technically, Calvino\u2019s novel plays with structure by way of concatenation. By this, I mean it tells micro-stories compelling in their own right but then ends them at the height of climax, a level of tease to make any Arabian concubine proud. A Winter\u2019s Night\u2019s meta-story is then about the reader (often pronounized as \u2018you\u2019) in his search to find the rest of the story and therefore closure. Story structure thus mirrors story theme: how readers engage with narrative as a whole and how our expectations for a standard narrative structure (rising action -> climax -> falling action -> denouement) have become inculcated in us and in fact now inform our fundamental conceptualizations of things like romantic relationships, life and death, and even our debates on intelligent design versus the theory of evolution. Deep deep stuff.Catherynne Valente, as the above quote reveals, thinks she\u2019s also writing about deep deep stuff. But the difference is that Radiance's form and content have a fractious, dissonant (and unengaging) relationship. In a different interview with Clarkesworld Magazine, she writes:I had to give myself permission to do certain things, use certain tricks\u2014like including scripts, audio, shifting POV, and the other ephemera and metafictional elements you mention. It\u2019s pretty much a postmodern free-for-all. At first I kept thinking: I can\u2019t just describe what\u2019s onscreen in a movie inside the book. That just makes it look like I\u2019d rather be making a movie. I had to get to a point where I could say: I actually can do that because it\u2019s my book and that\u2019s the right way to do it.That phrase \u2013 \u201ca postmodern free-for-all\u201d \u2013 says it all. The book is a mish-mash of ideas and forms, its structure a shotgun spread rather than a sniper\u2019s intimate voyeurism. The quote as a whole is an admission of self-indulgence. She includes scripts, audio, shifting POV, and other ephemera and metafictional elements not because doing so highlights explorations on \u201cseeing and being seen; on what the camera does to us when it never leaves our side; on who has the right to speak, and who has to buy it; and on the meaning of science fiction in a science fictional universe\u201d \u2013 but because she bloody well wanted to, propagating the mistaken post-modern confusion that MERE EXPLORATION of structure is, BY ITSELF, evidence of great and skillful artifice, if not authorial courage, and therefore worthy of being read.Well I disagree. I would quote Picasso when he wrote, \u201cIn my opinion to search means nothing\u2026 To find is the thing. Nobody is interested in following a man who, with his eyes fixed on the ground, spends his life looking for the purse that fortune should put in his path. The one who finds something no matter what it might be, even if his intention were not to search for it, at least arouses our curiosity, if not our admiration.\u201dAs I read through Radiance\u2019s self-indulgent epilogue (which amounts, quite clearly, to the author justifying her decision to use a shotgun structure because \u201chumans do not proceed in an orderly fashion from one scene to the next\u201d \u2013 which, by the by, is a standard postmodern claim that is completely false. Au contraire, it is the tragedy of humanity that we have no choice but to creep in a chronologically linear fashion from scene to scene and tomorrow to tomorrow until the last syllable of our borrowed time); its boring essays from fictional film critics; its lists of ship\u2019s manifest (and here I thought I left that self-important scheiss behind back on Walden Pond); and its long rants mistaking high-octane, purple prose like, \u201cthe Earth fucked the sky and made a hundred children\u201d for genuine exploration of humanity \u2013 as I went through all this, I was never once engaged mano y mano. This was no story but a magic show by a patchwork golem, a dazzling array of images and words that held all the cohesive meaning of a fireworks display. I was never shown why any of these characters might have a superior grasp than I do on, e.g., who has a right to speak, or what it means to be seen, or what the camera does to us when it never leaves our side. Worse, I was never shown why I should CARE what any of these characters think.In short, I would argue Radiance failed to ever find, or demonstrate, humanity in necessary quantities to overcome the artificiality of its narrative and structure. Its demands on my empathy muscles came far too late, far after it had lost me. Earlier, I brought up Italo Calvino\u2019s If on a Winter\u2019s Night, a Traveler as a successful example of postmodern literature. It is therefore with great irony (and thus also circularity) that I believe the concluding paragraph from NY Times\u2019 1981 review of the book nails exactly how I feel about Radiance:And then the book, for all its formidable wit and skill, is a confession of failure, and I think we shall get it wrong if we insist on converting all its apparent misses into clever hits. The stalled writer, the one who is in love with beginnings, says, \"I would like to be able to write a book that is only an incipit, that maintains for its whole duration the potentiality of the beginning, the expectation still not focused on an object.\" This is a desire, not a program. An expectation permanently unfocused will die, and an expectation that can't be focused is simply a disappointment. \u2026 As a book about broken narrative promises this work is impeccable. But its very success in this vein leads us to the sadness of its central subject, the absence of the artist, Dickens, Tolstoy, Stendhal, Dostoyevsky, who could brilliantly keep the promises he made."}, {"userName": "Jessica \u2741 \u27b3 Silverbow \u27b3 \u2741 Rabid Reads-no-more", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336538-jessica-silverbow-rabid-reads-no-more", "userReview": "Catherynne M.

Deathless is still my favourite of Valente's books and this one maybe didn't \"flow\" like I wanted it to. However I can't do anything but be amazed at her writing style and ideas and, most of all, knowledge of mythology. Radiance is extremely complex and full of references to mythology...I probably could re-read it all over again and find completely new elements. The blurb describes Radiance as a \"decopunk pulp SF alt-history space-opera mistery set in a Hollywood -- and solar system -- very different from our own.\". Sounds complex? You haven't seen anything. After reading (and loving) Deathless I actually understood that Valente's books have layers. Everything, every little detail, is important and has a meaning of its own and it's almost like the author is giving you tiny pieces of the puzzle as the story progresses: it's up to you to put them in the right place. The trick though is that even when that puzzle is complete you still don't know everything: and again it's up to you to find what it might represent once it's complete. Yes, there is an \"obvious\" message, but there are so many other different meanings that I dare you to tell me you've understood all about the book. The same goes for Radiance, really. I could tell you that Radiance is a book about storytelling and I could say that it is about life and death and everything in between and I would not be telling a lie.This author is one of the most talented voices of fantasy. She has it all: lavish writing style and gorgeous ideas.Favourite quotes:\u201cBut that wouldn't be honest. That wouldn't be real. That would give you the idea that a life is a simple thing to tell, that it's obvious where to start--BIRTH--and even more obvious where to stop--DEATH. Fade from black to black. I won't have it. I won't be one of the hundreds telling you that being alive flows like a story you write consciously, deliberately, full of linear narrative, foreshadowing, repetition, motifs. The emotional beats come down where they should, last as long as they should, end when they should, and that 'should' come from somewhere real and natural, not from the tyranny of the theatre, the utter hegemony of fiction. Why, isn't living easy? Isn't it grand? As easy as reading aloud.No.If I slice it all up and stitch it back together, you might not understand what I've been trying to say all my life: that any story is a lie cunningly told to hide the real world from the poor bastards who live in it. I can't. I can't tell you that lie...If I fixed it so time goes the way you expect, you might come away thinking I know what the hell I'm doing.\u201d\"But that's not how it is in real life, Rinny. Real life is all beginnings. Days, weeks, children, journeys, marriages, inventions. Even a murder is the beginning of a criminal. Perhaps even a spree. Everything is prologue. Every story has a stutter. It just keeps starting and starting until you decide to shut the camera off. Half the time you don't even realize that what you're choosing for breakfast is the beginning of a story that won't pan out till you're sixty and staring at the pastry that made you a widower. No, love, in real life you can get all the way to death and never have finished one single story. Or never even get one so much as half-begun.\"This.

It's lush. You just swim though her prose. I can understand her use of language being a bit too much for some people, but I ate it up like a rich meal paired with the perfect wine, topped off with a melt-in-your mouth dessert that leaves you uncomfortably full in the very best way.This truly does not feel like other novels. It's epistolary, and that's what elevates this book so much. Because of the format, you're not just watching the characters try to solve a mystery. You YOURSELF are piecing together this book, trying to solve for what exactly the mystery IS. Because of the format, you don't meet all the players and certain documents may seem out of place or utterly confusing. What is going on? You're forced to go on a similar journey as the characters. They are trying to figure out this mystery while you are trying to figure out the mystery of this book. It's meta, and it's amazing.I do think a passing understanding of film theory makes this book even better. Valente clearly knows her stuff when it comes to film (her father's first love was film-making), and it shows. Knowing a bit about gaze, perspective, and the role of the audience in film is integral to picking up some of this book's moments of sheer brilliance. The best films play with their audiences. By this, I don't mean they play tricks on their audiences (though that's fun, too!), but rather that great films are aware that they are being watched--voyeurs in plush seats in a darkened room. This book manages to do the same. The reader is the voyeur, but much like the characters in this book, readers are forced to \"step into the light.\" The format of the book requires a kind of active reading. Because you have to pieces this book together, Valente doesn't allow her readers to be passive voyeurs peering into this world, into this story. It's sheer brilliance.This book is definitely not for everyone. The dialogue is nowhere near the way people speak in real life. Place is given just as much page time as character and plot. The narrative structure is (intentionally!) fairly nonsensical.

The parts I enjoyed were just too infrequent.\nFull Review\nThis book wasn't on my radar at all. Ms. Valente was on the Sword & Laser podcast late last year, but I apparently forgot all about it. That should have been my first warning.I'm a big fan of movies. I'm a pretty big fan of science-fiction. This should have been a happy marriage for me, but it wasn't. I've seen hundreds of films. I've read hundreds of books. I do both for fun. I don't enjoy to study either. I don't find having to work for what the story is about. This book was a lot of work. In the end it wasn't worth it for me. I'm still not sure what exactly I read.This whole book seemed more like an exercise in clever writing than it was about telling a story. Maybe I'm just not smart enough for this book. I suspect this is more a case of not my kind of smarts. I imagine many people would feel just as uncomfortable reading books on computers as I did during parts of this. I don't like books that make me feel dumb.I think I'd have been less frustrated with this book if I simply didn't like it. The underlying mystery of Severin and the world building were intriguing. I particularly enjoyed the chapters with Erasmo and Cynthia and Mary Pellam's diary entries. Unfortunately that was it. If the whole book had been written like those chapters, I'd have been a lot happier.I found the chapters for Percival's final movie extremely confusing and often nonsensical. Most of the other chapters were unmemorable or equally confusing. It just feels like I was always missing something. I'd reread passages and whole pages and came away just as confused.The book seemed to have 2 endings. Much like the book, I found the first one confusing and frustrating. However I was surprised to find I liked the second. It kind of sums things up nicely for me. Confused and frustrated most of the time, with some parts I was surprised to like. Maybe you'll have a better experience with it than I did."}, {"userName": "Ashley *Hufflepuff Kitten*", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29787548-ashley-hufflepuff-kitten", "userReview": "DNF @ 23%Gahhhh I just can't.

I can honestly say that I've never read a novel like \"Radiance\" before, and I love it when I encounter those kinds of reading surprises. \"Radiance\" takes place on different planets, and it follows different plots and destinies in a non-linear way. It sounds confusing, and it is! But it's amazing how Catherynne M. Valente is still able to make sense of everything and maintain a common thread throughout. It's hard to describe what this book is about, but basically we follow a young girl and her father who both share a fascination for films and film making. As I said, the novel takes place on different planets, and thankfully the book comes with an overview of each planet's sign so that you know where there chapters are set. I have a lot of fascination for this novel, and I'm thrilled that my initial scepticism was brought to shame. I think that unique books like this should be celebrated and recognized, and that's why I highly recommend that you endeavour to go on this quirky, however amazing reading journey :)"}, {"userName": "Lily", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899725-lily", "userReview": "Outer space is the ultimate gothic mansion. What better place to search for things that go bump in the night? Radiance unfolds in a bygone era that never quite existed. The golden age of silent film... on the moon. Diving bells for the seas of Venus. The Ottoman empire stretching to Jupiter. These are the familiar bare bones of our solar system, clothed in the feathers and flesh of extraterrestrial fauna, and wearing a dandy top hat. It's an image partly reminiscent of a lot of classic sci-fi (for me, the ocean-filled Venus of The Space Trilogy came to mind), complete with mysterious, giant, life-giving creatures (like sandworms or mers, but with a twist). In this solar system full of beauty and adventure, we find pioneers seeking a new life, corporations seeking profit, and artists seeking inspiration. A conspicuously absent artist is the focus of this story: the documentarian Severin Unck. In her last project, she sought to investigate the abrupt disappearance of a town on Venus, which left behind nothing except a lone boy walking in circles. But before filming could be completed, Severin herself disappeared. All we have left are her surviving films, home movies from her childhood, and the complicated web of people who crossed paths with her and may or may not be willing to tell us what they know. And that's what this novel is made of. It's a mystery.... and yet it's not. It reminded me of Interstellar, in that there's a lot of intrigue built up, but there's really only one solution that's consistent with the spirit and logic of the story, and you can figure out the general idea very early on. It's a testament to the novel's multifaceted gloriousness that this element of predictability didn't detract from my enjoyment at all. I feel like I should say something about \"world building\", but it feels wrong to use the present tense: here's a world that's already been built, and we pop in to a show already in progress. It's like when you're minding your own business and suddenly hear people in the middle of a delicious conversation, and you're can't help being caught up in the struggle of understanding what they're on about. And really, that might be a crux of the book: when we tell a story, through film or anecdotes or advertisement, what are we on about? Is the truth being uncovered or hidden, or is it all just beside the point?We care about your family. No animals were harmed. The possibilities are endless. Got milk? Severin, as someone who is determined to learn the facts about a universe that is (to us) fantastical, is a perfect subject through which to investigate the gap between reality and stories. She actively rejects the gothic films made by her father, with all their intrigue and supernatural phenomena. And yet, her own life story starts to resemble just such a tale - at least, the version of her life story that we're being told. It's only that the answers to most stories are boring because they are supplied by the real world rather than - well, something better. Something more stimulating. Sit down with the Greeks and the Romans, and the boring answers get more interesting. Seasons because a girl and a crocus. Death because a girl and an apple. The moon because a girl keeps driving her daft chariot into the sea. It's all down to girls, one way or another."}, {"userName": "Thomas Wagner", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1276273-thomas-wagner", "userReview": "After some days of thought, realizing I admired this a bit more than I initially thought, settled on 3.5. Radiance is a book whose brilliance is in some ways a liability. It's impossible to deny the mastery of its craft, but if you aren't prepared for what you're getting into you can easily find yourself overwhelmed early on. It throws up so many layers of artifice that it's difficult to feel much but the most cursory emotional investment in its characters. But the way in which the book is essentially about its own artifice, without being tediously meta, is probably its most inspired storytelling hook. It's a novel about how our lives are narratives, and how those narratives can become grand and mythic and larger than all possible life when others add to them. Radiance may be a novel that is easier to admire at an intellectual level than enjoy as entertainment, but there's no doubt Catherynne Valente is an often astonishing talent, even if the kitchen-sink approach she's taken to Radiance means that form trumps content more often than not.The novel is an art-deco planetary romance set in the early-to-mid 20th century, in an alternate history where the human race has long colonized the entire solar system. Space is something not quite a vacuum, and all the planets are closer together and teeming with life. Venus is a lush and tropical world covered in oceans, the Moon is an airy resort, and even distant Pluto is verdant and populated by packs of giant buffalo-lizard things. It's connected physically to its moon Charon by a bridge of vines covered in dazzling flowers.The story deals with the mysterious disappearance of Severin Unck...

Every planet is habitable and inhabited by alien life and travel between planets is relatively easy. Severin is a film-maker, and the daughter of a renowned film-maker and the story is saturated by the aesthetics of early 20th century movie-making.The story is told via a number of different mechanisms. Transcripts of the movies of Severin Unck, the story of an evolving script that her father Percy is putting together about her disappearance and the boy Anchises, transcripts of secret interviews with Severin's defacto husband Erasmo and various other bits and pieces including some of Percy's home movies. The time period that's covered is vast as well with pieces as far apart as 1911 and 1971, even though Severin herself only lived into her 30s. As is typically with Valente, the language is amazing. The story-telling mechanism is also brilliant, and it's clear that Valente herself as first-hand knowledge of what it's like to be a child of a film-maker. However, these are people to be watched. There the sort that I don't read celebrity magazines to find out about. People who are always partly on, ready to be written about or filmed. As such, I have trouble engaging with them, and a great deal of trouble empathizing with.The eventual solution to the mystery is logical. It's certainly a reasonable conclusion, although a bit of a cheat. I'm not sure if it was worthwhile slogging through 400 pages of largely self-indulgent prose to get through though.

And all the planets--the moon, Venus, Neptune, Mars, etc--were habitable. And unlike A Trip to the Moon, no one lived on these planets but giant callowhales, and these whales produced milk that facilitated our ability to live on these planets, though no one knows what these callowhales are.Okay, then imagine that silent films are considered so artistic that films are produced primarily without sound, and also in black and white.Now put yourself in the Hollywood, film-noir mentality.

As always, Valente\u2019s writing is mesmerizing and unique, and I\u2019m awed by her ability to capture so many different tones.

She has inherited her father's love of the big screen but not his exuberant gothic style of filmmaking. Instead, Severin makes documentaries, artful and passionate and even rather brave - for she is a realist in a fantastic alternate universe, in which Hollywood occupies the moon, Mars is rife with lawless saloons, and the solar system contains all manner of creatures, cults and colonies. For Severin's latest project she leads her crew to the watery planet of Venus to investigate the disappearance of a diving colony there. But something goes wrong during the course of their investigations; and her crew limp home without her.All that remains of Severin are fragments. Can these snippets of scenes and shots, voices and memories, pages and recordings be collected and pieced together to tell the story of her life - and shed light on the mystery of her vanishing?
