In this case, trouble starts when the Vampire Council demands that Glory shut down her clothing store Vintage Vamp\u2019s Emporium because it\u2019s attracting too much attention from the outside world. Her personal life has also gone to hell in a handbasket\u2014literally. Her on again-off again relationship with yummy Vampire Jeremy Blade goes South when Jeremy learns that Glory had a fling with shifter/former bodyguard Rafael Valdez while she was possessed by a demon. Could matters possibly get worse?This is Glory \u2013 of course it can!When Glory is offered an opportunity to mentor a recently turned vampire, she takes the job in hopes of getting in good with the Vampire Council. Since Glory has experience mentoring new vamps (e.g., rock star Israel Caine), she agrees to the plan. Her new charge, Penny, is a young brainiac with no fashion sense whatsoever. Penny wants her family changed so that they can all live forever together. Glory is tasked with persuading Penny that her wishes are not in her family\u2019s best interest.Glory\u2019s problems worsen when Israel takes up drinking again, and then the devil himself makes an appearance. Lucifer offers Glory the one thing she\u2019s coveted for four hundred long years: the chance to be a size 6. In this seventh installment of the Real Vampires series, Ms. Bartlett once again hits a home run. You can\u2019t help but love and admire Glory as she navigates the tricky lanes of her vampire world in Austin, TX. Readers new to the series need not worry about feeling lost as this book can easily be read as a standalone. Real Vampires Don\u2019t Wear a Size Six will charm readers and keep them turning the pages until the very wonderful end. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2481083-sally", "userReview": "Light, fun and well written.

Just love the characters they are funny witty humorous and some even very dangerous.Glory is just so funny. She kind of reminds me of Charlene Harris's Sookie Stakehouse the trouble she gets into all the time without even looking for it. The situations so gets herself into are pretty funny.Glory is a plus size vampire at least in he mind with an on and off relationship with a sexy Scottish highlander named Blade (Jerry for short)Glory has her hands full this time around. She is in hot water with the counsel and needs to get on there good side. So her fellow vampire Damien suggest she mentor a newly turned vampire. Oh boy does she have her hands full and this young gal she is a scientist with 3 degrees and only in he early twenties.To top it all off the demons are after her again to come work for them and harvest souls for them. They are constantly in her face and going after the people she loves. Glory is in the mist of a love triangle sort of. She constantly has her men around her and it's wreaking havoc on her relationship with Jerry that's on a break right now .This situation creates so many funny scenes that have you laughing your butt off.Glory needs to deal with so many things going on she is a little bit overwhelmed with the demon problem the mentoring a newly turned vampire that didn't want to be turned and making things work with Blade and Ian's new miracle pill allowing you to actually eat a meal she so wants to try out.. Glory's relationship is so hot a sexy the love scenes are great and have you rooting for them both (her and Blade)to make a go of it and wishing you had your very own Highland Warrior. I love the character's that surround Glory they are a hoot and great friends and her loyalty to them is heartfelt.Gerry carries her characters from one book to the other having Glory interact with them in each story which I so love that.The books was full danger and many humors laughs that had you laughing constantly throughout every page and loving the way things unfold through the story making it a page turner. The book ends with such a surprise ending that I never saw it coming! What a cliff hanger loved it ! Can't wait to the next book. I recommended read for all.

It was bad enough having a crazy demon named \"Alesa\" shacked up inside Glory's body. Too bad Glory, you're now going to have to deal with the demon world all over again. This time, good ol Lucifer is going to be involved, Oh Joy! It seem that Glory really ticked the demons off this time. They want her to do their dirty work and sell her friend's souls to Lucifer. If that is not bad enough, Glory is also in trouble with the Austin Vampire Council for causing a major disturbance when her eyes turned red in front of everyone at her best friends wedding. If it was not for the darn demon Alesa living inside of Glory, none of this trouble would have happened with the Austin Vampire Council. Now there is a possibility that she'll have to move from Austin because of the wedding incident.Glory now has to answer to the demons and deliver up some souls to Lucifer, or her best bud and ex-lover Rafael Valdez will be punished. Glory must also prove herself to the Vampire Council by being a mentor to a newly turned vampire named Penny. She must show Penny the rights and wrongs of becoming a vampire, and also show the vampire council that she is responsible and \"has her act together.\" If Glory can not get her act together, she will be packing her high heels and leaving Austin for good.Poor Glory St. Clair has her plate filled to the roof this time. Will she do Lucifer's dirty work and sell her friends souls to him, or will she tell Lucifer to take a flying leap up to Haven? Can Glory show the Austin Vampire Council that she can teach Penny, her new fledgling vampire how to act as a good vampire? Can she redeem herself, and save herself from having to move? Last but not least, can Glory manage to keep the most important thing her life, the three men that she loves so much, from killing one another over their jealousy of one another? Can Glory manage this full plate of hers, or will everything around her come tumbling down?Once again Gerry Bartlett knows how to keep the Glory St. Clair fans laughing. I just love good 'ol Glory, and her drama filled life. The man drama throughout is the best part. Only Glory can have three men after her, and might I say, three gorgeous immortal men. YUMMY!

Life is going good for Glory, her long time on-again off-again boyfriend and sire is ready to settle down. Her store is running smoothly and her best friend is on her honeymoon. But things can change fast around Glory. The vampire council members want Glory to close her store and leave town because they belive she brings too much attention to the vampire world. So when her friend Damian, who is also a member of the council, asks Glory to help mentor a young girl who was turned vampire aganist her will. Penny Patterson is nineteen years old and has three degrees from UT. She is a brain but has no fashion sense but Glory is determined to help her with that. Penny is not happy about being a vampire. She wants to change her twin sister and her parents so that they can be together for always. It is up to Glory to get her to change her mind. As if having to train a new fledgling is not tough enough the devil sends two demons to try and get Glory to become a soul harvester for him. If she does Lucifer makes her an offer he thinks she can't turn down. To be a size six forever. Glory tells him no way. Just to make things more of a mess, Glory gets word that the first vampire she mentored, Israel Caine famous rock star, has fallen off the wagon and is drinking blood laced with alcohol. He is staying drunk all the time. He even attacked his best friend and manager. Now all Glory has to do is keep Penny in line and teach her what she needs to know, keep the demons at arms length, help Israel stop drinking and fight for the man she loves.  This is the seventh installment of Ms Bartlett's Real Vampires series. This has to be one of the best series I have ever read. Even after seven books, Ms Bartlett keeps the story and her characters fresh and never boring. You have the old characters and new ones are added in without a hitch. I have said it before and will say it again, this is a great laugh out loud series. This series is a keeper.

First off I have to say I'm a huge Glory St Clair & Gerry Bartlett fan. I've been with the series since the beginning. This book had a lot going on at once, which unfortunately took away from the depth of some parts of the story. I really liked the aspect of Glory & her mentoring the fledgling Penny, Glory's conflicting feelings between Jerry, Rafe, & Israel Cain, along with her resolution between them (I just hope it sticks this time), and parts of the conflict between the demon's temptations & Glory and her friends. I was disappointed with the end result between the problems between Penny & her twin sister Jenny. It seemed like there was going to be more involved when Penny finally figured out what her sister was really like. It just kind of puttered out. Then there was the ending, the whole battle seen between Glory and her guys & the Goddess was very disappointing. It was build up & build up and then poof, done without a hitch in a couple of paragraphs. Talk about a let down. It ends too suddenly with everything perfectly fine, even one of the most greedy, power-hungry, bad guys suddenly giving up his empire & most of his powers for something so normal & good, which came in from out of nowhere. And why? Then I have some problems with how Glory behaves with Rafe & Cain and then considers it not to be cheating if it doesn't include full intercourse. Truly I would've given this a 3.5 if I could, but there is enough good stuff to push it up to a 4 for me instead of down to a 3."}, {"userName": "Theresa", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11615310-theresa", "userReview": "This book was a lot better than the previous ones. Glory still gets herself into a lot of trouble but she\u2019s handling her guys better. And the action and problems make more sense. The feel of things that we liked about the first books are coming back. It\u2019s story driven instead of relationship driven. Encourages me to finish reading the series. Jerry leaves town: again. This time to think things through and give her space to decide who she wants. And there\u2019s more demons giving Glory \u2018incentives\u2019 to work for their master. But then wonderfully loyal Jerry returns, determined to do anything he can to keep Glory. Even cope with Ray and Rafe and everything else going on. Glory is doing her best to stay true also and the tense interaction between the three guys is fun to read. Glory\u2019s previous dealings with the demon is causing her some problems with the vampire council, so she\u2019s given a newbie vampire to mentor to get on their good side. Penny is a good kid, very similar to Glory, but she\u2019s got problems of her own. Top that off with Ray\u2019s returned drinking problem, Rafe\u2019s new club, Ian\u2019s move to Austin, Glory\u2019s attempts to pacify Lucifer and it\u2019s an interesting book. Emmie Lou & Harvey Nutt are back! This time on the good side as angels sent to help Glory with her demon problem. I love it! Though their idea of heaven is a bit unrealistic. Also there\u2019s not as much Aggie. Yay! And I love Penny. I hope to see a lot more of her. Fave scenes: Lacey and the white rats, Jerry and Rafe\u2019s fight, Flo and the three-way mirror and the battle with the goddess."}, {"userName": "Darcy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2225246-darcy", "userReview": "This is one of my favorite series but I was disappointed with this book and it can all be summed up by one word...Penny. I hated this new character that was introduced. She was so whiny it drove me nuts and colored how I felt about the rest of the book and even made me not want to read this one. I normally can read one of these books in one night after work, this book took me 3 nights to read, I kept putting it down to read something else.Penny, a new vampire, is saddled to Glory for punishment as she has to mentor her. Penny was changed against her will and all she did was whine about how her life was crap, how she wanted to tell her family, and how she didn't need anyone to watch over her. Her actions were just like a sullen teenager, appropriate as she is a teen. By the end she was better, so there is some hope if she shows up in future books.The other action had to to with repercussions of Rafe using his powers in the last book. Demons come after him and use Glory as leverage. I found the demons to be a bore, along with that story line. The only good thing about it was seeing how the guys that normally irritate each other, work together.It also looks like we are up for a big reveal with Glory and how she is special in some way. It will be interesting to see what happens there.

Glory is impossible not to like- I love her! This is the seventh installment in this series and I have not read the first six. Though the book is a wonderful stand alone read, I think I would have given it five stars and enjoyed myself more if I had more of a background feel for the characters. I definitely plan on going back and reading the first six- and I hope she continues on for awhile with Glory. So much dialogue, I love books doused in dialogue.The only part I was truly disappointed with was the conclusion- I felt like some situations didn't get as much focus as they should in the end... and that another didn't end with as big of a bang as it could have. I'm trying to be general without giving any spoilers- but there is a fight that I thought ended too swiftly. It doesn't matter, the book is still a great read.

Cute read, lots of humor and snark with glory. Dialogue-heavy with some occasionally clunky moments, and there's a lot of references to past characters and series, but it leaves something interesting. I'll have to read the first six at some point and see where it builds from there. I'm kind of loving the fact that her definitions of love with her love-triangle/square dealie aren't as clear-cut as the ones in YA. On another note, I hate the drawing on the cover. It looks really cliche (and totally not Glory's house at all), and the vampire on it looks so much skinnier than Glory is. Just my opinion. Still, a series that I'll definitely continue to keep reading for a bit.

For once I would like to see Jerry truly scream at her and tell her that her ways are wrong. Leave her ass for a while, maybe play up Mara. Give her a kiss or two and see how she feels. If she can't take it then don't dish it. I going to try to continue to read the series but I don't know if I can take much more of her childish games.

Blade is not my favorite character and I was a bit disappointed by his reappearance. I was hoping Glory would explore things with Rafe. Love how the author was able to add a human element to Ray and show him battling his addiction. I cannot wait for the next book.
