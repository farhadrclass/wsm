Unwavering in his delivery, Donald Ray Pollock gives us a peek at the world, through the eyes of some gnarly and grotesque individuals. What stands out is the casual ease in which the violence and carnage is served up, sans the antics that reek of shock value, making this deliciously dark plot palatable in some strange and unnerving way. That's not to say the reality these people call life is easy to choke down, especially for those of us that have impulse control and a moral compass; so prepare yourself. Sometimes their decisions are born out of desperation and other times it's pure evil at the helm, or the devil all the time, if you will. Most disturbing of all is the twisted rationalization that tends to happen within the mind\u2014the justification that this act, whatever it might be, is the only way to feel a connection to their maker.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to live a good life. It seems like the devil don\u2019t ever let up.\u201d\nThere\u2019s the husband with the makeshift alter, deep in the woods, where blood is spilled in the name of sacrifice. It\u2019s the only way this devoted husband can see to save his wife from the painful end she\u2019s staring down. And his son, forever changed by the bloody horrors he's had to witness, was the one and only character I found myself clinging to\u2014rooting for some sort of redeeming end.Creepiest of all, the traveling pastor that claims faith alone helped him to overcome his very real fear of spiders. Now he shocks congregations by covering his body with the eight-legged freaks (*cringe*) or eating them (*gag*) to prove his message. Have I mentioned how much I hate spiders? My fear runs so deep, my skin is crawling even writing this. And you can\u2019t forget the pastor\u2019s strange sidekick\u2014a man that opted to drink poison to prove his faith, earning him a pair of shriveled legs and a bad attitude.Then there\u2019s the husband and wife that spend their \u2018vacations\u2019 trolling the highway for \u2018models\u2019. She's the bait for the next man deemed lucky enough to sate the disgusting photographer and his relentless quest for the perfect picture. There\u2019s a host of death, destruction and evil deeds connecting two small towns in Ohio and West Virginia, and the way the author pieces the multiple storylines together is shocking in all its perfection. Some might even say fitting, for this dangerously dark cast."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "There\u2019s chick litDick litMick litFlick litTrick litSick litQuick litAnd nowHick lit! Well, yes, an affectionate term which I learned from one of the various great reviews of this novel on Goodreads, which probably doesn\u2019t need another rave review, you all got the message now that Donald Ray Pollock is the real deal by now, but I feel compelled to tell you again. Because I\u2019ve not been having such a great time with novels recently. A kind of chill has settled over our relationship. Neither of us wants to be the one to say anything. But many times I avoid looking my shelf-of-unread-novels in the eye. I think about the golden days when we were discovering something new about each other it seems nearly every other week. Now, I don\u2019t know, the spark\u2019s gone. We've lost that lovin' feelin'. Maybe.Well, that\u2019s what I was half-articulating in that murky algae-filled bottom layer of my semiconscious mind. There\u2019s a lot of dank rotted stuff down there. I can\u2019t face it, ugh. That\u2019s why it's down there. But The Devil All The Time, with its own-brand 90-miles-an-hour-down-a-dead-end-street amphetamine rush of gap-toothed whiskey-stained paraplegic-pedophilic shotgun-blasting animal-crucifying holy rolling raping rural delights has perked me up, plumped my feathers, slapped me round the kisser with an empty pack of Five Brothers, bought me a ticket to Meade, Ohio, and, because there\u2019s nothing so sweet as reading about lives you can be grateful you\u2019re not living, put a lopsided smile back onto the front of my head.

Even though it took me a long time to finish, not once did I want to give up on it. I listened to the audio version. I think that the brilliant narration by Mark Bramhall added to this novel. He is one of the best narrators that I have come across. If you listen to audio this is a good one. This is my first Donald Ray Pollock novel but it certainly will not be my last. Highly recommended to people who can handle dark and disturbing stories. I would characterize this as \"grit lit\". It truly is the darkest book that I have come across in a long time.

From the acclaimed author of Knockemstiff\u2014called \u201cpowerful, remarkable, exceptional\u201d by the Los Angeles Times\u2014comes a dark and riveting vision of America that delivers literary excitement in the highest degree.\u00a0In The Devil All the Time, Donald Ray Pollock has written a novel that marries the twisted intensity of Oliver Stone\u2019s Natural Born Killers with the religious and Gothic over\u00adtones of Flannery O\u2019Connor at her most haunting.\u00a0Set in rural southern Ohio and West Virginia, The Devil All the Time follows a cast of compelling and bizarre characters from the end of World War II to the 1960s. There\u2019s Willard Russell, tormented veteran of the carnage in the South Pacific, who can\u2019t save his beautiful wife, Charlotte, from an agonizing death by cancer no matter how much sacrifi\u00adcial blood he pours on his \u201cprayer log.\u201d There\u2019s Carl and Sandy Henderson, a husband-and-wife team of serial kill\u00aders, who troll America\u2019s highways searching for suitable models to photograph and exterminate. There\u2019s the spider-handling preacher Roy and his crippled virtuoso-guitar-playing sidekick, Theodore, running from the law. And caught in the middle of all this is Arvin Eugene Russell, Willard and Charlotte\u2019s orphaned son, who grows up to be a good but also violent man in his own right.\u00a0Donald Ray Pollock braids his plotlines into a taut narrative that will leave readers astonished and deeply moved. With his first novel, he proves himself a master storyteller in the grittiest and most uncompromising American grain.\u201dMy Review: This is Donald Ray Pollock's first novel. After being mauled and kicked by Knockemstiff, his short-story collection, I was chomping at the bit for this book to come in to my village library. Today was my first wholly peaceful day, and what better thing to do with a peaceful day than to read about the broken and forgotten members of Murrikin society?So I got on the Greyhound for Knockemstiff, garlic around my neck and an illegal assault rifle perched in the seat beside me, scared stiff that one of these Hill Williams was gonna start some shit with the fancy New Yorker getting' off the bus.Funnily enough, that's exactly what happened. Look...read Knockemstiff and, if you feel the need to bleach your eyeballs and you want to scream, cry, and unswallow on average once a page, this isn't the book for you. It's not that worse things happen in it, although some do happen that made me scream, cry, and unswallow, it's that this novel is unremittingly grim and a lot less easy to stop reading than a story collection is.I started this book around 4pm. It's now 3am. I paused long enough to eat some cucumber and tomato salad and a wedge of watermelon around 10pm, and I think I piddled around midnight...but that was with the book propped open on the tank top. I'll mop the floor tomorrow...errrmmm, later today.Pollock is the kind of writer Hemingway wanted to be. Simple, elegantly shod, carefully manicured sentences whip out their truncheons and, never mind the flying blood, wail on the innocent reader's brain-box. Dazed, in pounding agony from the grinding of severely fractured bone plates in the readerly skull, eyes absorb and record and flinch away from the matter-of-fact violence. It's not played for gore or shock. Pollock just...writes it the way it was in his head.Mother of all the gods. That sentence scares me shitless.The stories that make up the braids of the novel are, in themselves, good novellas. Put together, though, the effect is overkill. Oh dear. Bad choice of words. It's one bridge too far into horrorville. The last thirty or so pages, while well written, just didn't keep up the pace of revelation. In every other part of the book, there was a blood clot coming loose and causing fresh damage as the characters got closer to the inevitable ending...so I kept moving...and then, well, some of that sense of howcanhetopthis zomg he did it got lost.And now I will be turning on the Snarkinator. Those whose tastes are for tomes lit'ry which ahhhr evah sew reefahayned, please seek the exits.Pollock got an MFA. I find MFA writers are all much of a muchness to me. A bit like opening a box of dried dates hoping for something other than a sugar coma, permaybehaps a peppermint or a Red Hot secreted in amongst the sticky soft sweetness. I have my list of offenders, but I've puked on them elsewhere, so I'll leave it at Paul Auster Jeffrey Eugenides Jonathan Franzen Dave Eggers Jonathan Safran Foer et alii, none of whose books I can tell apart from the authors's various ouevres without a look at the spine or title page. Yes yes, nice sentence, lovely image, I'm sorry was something supposed to move me here, to reach across the gap between our brains and change me? Cause it sure as pork rinds didn't. And it never does, all the mooin' and carryin'-on y'all groupies do aside.And the last, well, last six or so chapters of this novel? They're the first time I felt Pollock's MFA intrude into his writing. He's still got more potency in his keyboarding fingers than those boys. I knock off a whoppin' tenth of a star from perfect because of that. It's a little like complaining that the blowjob didn't last long enough (I don't have any idea what the equivalent is for women, sorry ladies but I am just not anxious to know either). Describe the worst sex you ever had: It was marvelous, as the old joke goes.And, not a small consideration, is it me, or is it he? I could simply be grumping about this because the way things turn out isn't the way I want them to. But hang on! The ending, you'll recall I said above, is inevitable. And it is. The only ending this book could have. I liked it!So maybe, just maybe, it's that bloody degree reefahayneeng the gasoline-and-pigshit essence of this wonderful book. I sure as all get-out hate that idea. I suspect it's true. But, and this is KEY, do NOT let this discourage you from visiting the bottom of the heap with Pollock. This is the real deal.The real deal.EDITED TO ADD 10/25/2012: The novel has won the Best Foreign Crime Novel prize in France!"}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "Willard Russell prays over a prayer log for his cancer-ridden wife with his son, Arvin. A spider-eating preacher is convinced he can bring back the dead. A husband and wife pick up hitchhikers, photograph them, and kill them. How will all of their paths intersect?Knockemstiff was one of my favorite books this year and I was anxious for Donald Ray Pollock to try his hand at a novel. Now I'm anxious for him to write a couple hundred more.The Devil All the Time dips into the same well as Knockemstiff at first. I had to admit I wasn't sure about things in the early-goings, not until I saw where things are going. The stories don't appear related at all except for the backwoods Ohio setting. Not until Arvin and Leonora wound up in the same place.The overlying theme of The Devil All The Time seems to be that you can't run forever, something Williard, Roy, Teagardin, and most of the other characters learn the hard way by the story's end. I loved trying to figure out where the various plot threads would knot and tangle together. Besides obviously reminding me of Knockemstiff, it also reminded me of No Country for Old Men at times.By far my favorite pair of characters to follow was Carl and Sandy. Since I've been watching a lot of Dexter lately, I latched on to the duo pretty quickly. Lee Bodecker was a close second, since he was the closest thing to a common character appearing in all the various threads. By the time the end rolled around, I wasn't sure who would live, right up until the last page. The Devil All the Time was a brutal thrill ride through the sad lives of a fistful of characters.

Small towns and highways connecting them to other small towns with convenience stores, schools, cornfields, dirt roads, churches, wood-paneled homes and their sheds. But it doesn't take you very long to know that this decor is just a fa\u00e7ade for where you really are. The plants have withered, the dogs are skinny, all eyes are dead. Everything is thirsty. The pure thirst for water is numbed and buried in dust. Alcohol and blood are all that is left to appease the cruel tongues slithering in the dried-up maws and mouths. The only soft caress you're likely to get is that of a rare breeze that seems out of place in the rough landscape and flees just as soon as it arrived. The only color comes from reddish brown stains in the sand, the only sound comes from your own laboured breathing. You are in Hell.The Devil has taken a seat in his favorite throne: the stone-cold hearts of the people who roam this desert. Senseless violence goes hand in hand with outrageous sexual proclivities. As the Devil is steering everyone in desperate circles of debaucheries and murders, it is easy to be entertained by the spectacle but difficult to empathise with the grim cast of characters who are slowly casting off their human shell. The only warm, sweet sensation that is left in these arid lands is that of a possibility of revenge, the prospect of somehow ending this miserable display. Some of the people have embraced the Devil willingly. Some have tried to stay ahead of him but were caught up in his remorseless swoop. Some have tried to confront him with dry decomposing Bibles and pitiful prayers to grey skies only to find themselves choking in the sand. Their tales and their vividly detailed backgrounds are what you'll find in this book. The most interesting story came from the one who managed to stay behind the Devil, staying out of view and cleaning up the mess. The one who decided to have a staring contest with the abyss as it gazed back into him, unblinking. His own brand of emptiness is pitted against the endless depths of evil as the pages turn and the reader is swept away in this mesmerising story of a handful of good intentions in a world of evil. It's not hope that gets you through this desert, but the thrill of witnessing the wicked and the chance of beating the Devil at his own game while secretly enjoying his company. Don't miss this journey."}, {"userName": "James Thane", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483907-james-thane", "userReview": "This is a beautifully-written, captivating book about a number of mostly poverty-stricken rural characters, some of whom are down on their luck and others of whom are simply bad to the bone.Set in rural Ohio and West Virginia, the story takes place over a period from the end of World War II until the middle of the 1960s. It weaves together the strands of several different stories, and the characters include a husband and wife team of serial killers who hunt their male \"models\" along the nation's highways. There are a couple of seriously screwed-up preachers, a totally bent sheriff, a war veteran who spends hours at his \"prayer log\" sacrificing and pleading with God to save his wife who is dying of cancer, and their son, Arvin, who pulls the various parts of the story together. The supporting cast includes a number of minor, but equally well-drawn characters, virtually all of whom are unforgettable.Also unforgettable is the setting. Pollock paints a vivid portrait of these small towns and isolated farms where hope and opportunity are totally foreign concepts. To say that these people lead often desperate, hard scrabble lives would be an understatement. Although the book is set in the middle of the Twentieth Century, in some respects many of these people are still living as though it were the beginning of the century.There is a lot of brutal action in this book, but the story is so well-told that Pollock draws you in from virtually the first line. And even though it's very hard to sympathize with a lot of the characters, you turn the last page with a deep sense of regret that the book has ended.

The face and body may be perfect, but if a twisted gene or malformed egg can produce physical monsters, may not the same process produce a malformed soul? Monsters are variations from the accepted normal to a greater or a less degree. As a child may be born without an arm, so one may be born without kindness or the potential of conscience. A man who loses his arms in an accident has a great struggle to adjust himself to the lack, but one born without arms suffers only from people who find him strange. Having never had arms, he cannot miss them. To a monster the norm must seem monstrous, since everyone is normal to himself. To the inner monster it must be even more obscure, since he has no visible thing to compare with others. To a criminal, honesty is foolish. You must not forget that a monster is only a variation, and that to a monster the norm is monstrous.\u201d \u2015 John Steinbeck, East of EdenI learned that there are monsters among us at a fairly young age. On a bright spring morning around 1971, I was riding to Foster's Alabama, with a high school friend. There was a car, off the road, and stuck in a ditch.John said we should pull off and help. But something didn't look right about it. One man stood at the front of the Caddy. Another stood by the trunk. As we approached, the man by the trunk looked at me. There are some people who have nothing behind their eyes. There is no conscience, or soul there, if you will.I screamed at John to drive, even reaching to shove the steering wheel over to swerve us back on the roadway. It was a bit of good fortune.Everyone loved Buddy Copeland, a big fireman, who was driving his pickup to go fishing on the Black Warrior River that morning. He had a winch on his truck. Being Buddy, he pulled over to help get the car out of the ditch. When they found him, it appeared he had decided to snack on a ham sandwich before heading on to fish. A blood soaked bit of it lay on the passenger seat by the door where the gun blast had blown it from his mouth. The men who killed him were named Turk and Alexander. They had no love for Buddy. He must have seen the body of the banker in the trunk of the Caddy they had hi-jacked earlier that morning. I watched their trial.I grew up to hunt men and women who had no conscience, no soul behind the eyes. I was an Assistant District Attorney for almost 28 years. Unlike a lot of ADAs who swaggered around with their badge and a gun on their side, I carried a gun because of need.Although most of my police friends favored a 9mm, I preferred a Walther PK .380. I was trained to shoot by the best shots in law enforcement. \"Don't be a hero. Shoot for center body mass. Double tap. Shoot to kill. You don't, they'll kill you.\" I was a cop's ADA. I was good at it. I played to win. If I didn't think you were guilty, I refused to take the case. I backed up an officer during an investigation more than once. It was an honor.My job was not done from a clean office. I went to the scene. I worked cases where sons killed parents for crack money, men shook babies to death, and jealous ex-husbands killed their ex-wives in front of the kids. The baby killer is on death row. When they slip him the needle, I'll be there as a witness. Don't let Donald Ray Pollock fool you. Knockemstiff is a real place. It's a ghost town now. The nice name for the place is Shady Glen. Look at an Ohio Map from 1919, you won't find it. Look on a 1940 map, there it is. Pollock ought to know. He lived there before heading to Chillicothe to become a laborer at a paper mill for more than thirty years. After that he got an MFA and began to write. His first book is, you guessed it, Knockemstiff. Sherwood Anderson's advice to William Faulkner was good. \"Write what you know.\" Otherwise, we might never have known about Yoknapatawpha County.I've known places like Knockemstiff. I worked two homicided that ended up on Tuscaloosa's side of the County Line that separated us from Walker County. What began in Walker County ended up down on the Tiger Mine Strip Pit Road. It's a lonely place, where the maggots do their job if the body's not found soon enough.As Pollock tells us, law enforcement didn't show up much in Knockemstiff. Neither did Walker County Law like to escort Tuscaloosa ADAs up on their Beat 10 road. It was a rough place. The people didn't trust outsiders. I took my own cop friends with me when I had to interview witnesses on Beat 10. They weren't any happier about it than I was.The Devil All the Time begins idyllically enough. Willard Russell has survived war in the Pacific Theater in WWII. He's on his way home to Coal Creek, West Virginia to his parents home. But a stop in Meade, Ohio, leads him to a diner, the Wooden Spoon, where he meets a waitress named Charlotte. She's a woman he can't forget.Although he returns to Coal Creek, he finds his mother has picked out a bride for him. Helen is an unattractive young woman. But Willard's mother had promised Helen's mother she'd look out after the poor thing when Helen's mother died.Willard can't forget Charlotte, returns to Meade and marries her. They rent a house up in the hollers of Knockemsstiff from a cuckolded lawyer. They are happy. Willard and Charlotte have a son, Arvin Eugene. All's well until Charlotte gets the Cancer and Willard constructs an altar out of a fallen log. He and Arvin pray aloud there at the log for Charlotte's recovery. But their prayers are unanswered.Willard must believe in an Old Testament God. If the prayers don't work by themselves, God must require blood sacrifice. Dogs, sheep, and larger game are strung up and bled to cover the prayer log in an offering satisfying to God. But if God is anywhere around, he's not in Knockemstiff.Disconsolate from Charlotte's death, Willard cuts his throat at the prayer log, leaving Arvin Eugene an orphan. When Arvin reports his father's death to Deputy Leo Bodecker, he takes him to the bloody clearing in the woods.\"'Goodamn it, Boy,what the hell is this?'\"It's a prayer log,' Arvin said, his voice barely a whisper.\"What? A prayer log?'Arvin stared at his father's body, 'But it don't work,' he said.\" Arvin is sent to live with his grandparents back in Coal Creek. It seems he has a new sister, Leonore. She is the daughter of Helen, the woman Willard's mother had wanted him to marry.Helen had taken up with a travelling preacher, Roy, who was accompanied by a paraplegic guitarist named Theodore. After Leonore's birth, Roy becomes convinced that if he could bring someone back from the dead, the audiences at his revival would grow by leaps and bounds. God must have been on vacation again. Leonore is just as much an orphan as Arvin Eugene. They come to view one another as brother and sister. Roy and Theodore take it on the lam after the Lazarus routine fails to take.Years pass. Leo Bodecker, now sheriff, has a new set of problems on his hands. His sister Sandy is peddling her ass out of the restaurant where she waitresses. It seems his old opposition, the former Sheriff is rallying support for a new campaign. Sandy is complaint number one. Leo has got to do about his Sister's indiscriminate exercise of her sexuality, which is bounteously generous. The problem seems to be solved when Sandy settles down with Carl Henderson, a real shutterbug, who whisks Sandy away from town on extended vacations to add to his portfolio.But there are no easy solutions in The Devil All the Time Carl's idea of a vacation is to wander the back roads picking up hitchhikers using Sandy as his bait. His favorite line of photography is taking photographs of Sandy in the arms of their unfortunate hitchikers, whom Carl dispatches with proficiency, documenting the whole sordid mess on film, developing his work in a private darkroom.Meanwhile, down in Coal Creek, Arvin Eugene, protector of Leonore, discovers that the new Preacher had rather administer to the youngest of his congregation, including Leonore. When Pastor Teagarden impregnates Leonore, he rejects her, moving on to younger and more attractive congregants.If God is present anywhere in  he finds himself the incarnation of Arvin Eugene, who is packing his father Willard's Luger 9mm pistol, which he had traded for his own Nambu pistol taken as a souvenir ln the Pacific. Fleeing from Coal Creek, following meting out the Lord's vengeance on the misguided Reveverend, Arvin begins the long hitchike back to Knockemstiff.In an almost incredible symmetry, who should stop to give him a lift but our happy serial killers Sandy and Carl. Arvin Eugene may be the most handsome model, the couple has ever scored. But Arvin is alert and most rescue himself from the shutterbug two which will not endear himself to sheriff Leo Bodecker.Bodecker and Arvin take one last walk to the prayer log. Whether God is present, or the Devil laughs at one more triumph, the reader must discover for himself.Pollock is a remarkable new voice in American literature. While he obviously shares comparison with Flannery O'Connor, none of O'Connor's theology is readily apparent in Pollock's work. Rather, picture William Gay decked out in clean carpenter's overalls, and read Provinces of Night or, among the most grotesque, Twilight. Here are the darkest aspects of Cormac McCarthy, and Tom Franklin as seen in Poachers.Once again, in Donald Ray Pollock we have a novelist who writes that there are monsters among us and that to the monstrous, the norm is simply montrous."}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "Hey, parents, having problems getting you kids to behave in church? Let them spend a Sunday with Willard Russell. Willard isn\u2019t a preacher, and he doesn\u2019t have one of those big mall-like mega churches. What Willard has is a log in the woods. That\u2019s right, a damn log in the woods. A prayer log if you will, and he\u2019s hung up some crosses around it, and he makes sure that his son Arvin is out there all the time praying with all he\u2019s got. Don\u2019t mind all that dried blood and animal bones. Willard thinks the Good Lord needs a sacrifice if you ask him for something big, like curing his wife of cancer. Send your little ones with him for a full day of log prayin\u2019 and blood sprayin\u2019, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll never hear another peep out of them at your regular service again.Willard and Arvin live in the area of Knockemstiff, Ohio, which should be familiar to those who read Pollock\u2019s previous book. Some of the characters reappear here as he tells a story that extends from Willard\u2019s return from the horrors of Pacific combat in World War II into the 1960s with multiple characters who all have blood on their hands in one form or another. We\u2019ll meet a murderous husband and wife as well as a corrupt sheriff, and a bug eating holy man wannabe with a crippled sidekick.Pollock again depicts a rural lifestyle where dreams die quickly, and the only people with any hope are the religious who remain convinced that God will someday reward them despite all evidence to the contrary in their miserable lives. As the years pass, all the characters act in ways that put them on an eventual collision course.Another winner from Pollock who is right up there with Daniel Woodrell in depicting how harsh the rural lifestyle can be. It had a few too many coincidences in the end for my taste, but this is still a book that\u2019s gonna be on my mind for a good long while."}, {"userName": "Zoeytron", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron", "userReview": "A preacher who eats spiders, trying to strike his own parable with the church folk.

The woman, thinking herself a slightly better class of trash than her husband, idly scratches her \u201cjigger\u201d bites and dreams of moving on without him. A sheriff who recognizes that being the law in a backward county has its advantages.A prayer log lies just inside the perimeter of the woods. Day after day, a husband saturates it with a sacrifice of blood. His own blood, the blood of a lamb, of fresh roadkill, of any breed of unfortunate stray that might cross his path. In his twisted and tormented logic, he fervently believes if he and his little boy pray loudly and long enough, The Cancer will be taken from his wife.

Well this Pollock is just as creative with his storytelling that leaves a deep branding in your mind and soul of a human stain of evil characters, that will stay with you well after you have finished this book. I am thinking of similarities here to Authors of likes of Jim Thompson who wrote \u2018The Killer inside me\u2019 and Daniel Woodrell.In the town Knockemstiff Pollock has crammed a motley crew of all the grittiest and evil characters you could find. These characters are ones you don\u2019t want to tell your kids that they exist on this planet. You will find in these pages slices of the worst of the worst. The show is on and the location is Knockemstiff, you will get more than you fair slice of the darkest of souls that you could muster up. The hero for me in this story is Arvin he dishes out some sweet justice that makes you really rejoice in accolades of well done i been waiting for that evil good for nothing to taste some justice. The author is hitting topics here head on, ones that the Vatican need to take heed of and act, too many darn wolves in Sheep\u2019s clothing.Some really swell writing from Pollock.

I find it curious that so many people have shelved Pollock's sophomore novel as horror, because while it is horrifying in places, and deals with some chilling characters, horror it is not. In his review of Pollock's debut Knockemstiff, Kemper uses the terms redneck noir and hick lit and that's much closer to capturing what this novel is offering to anyone who dares pick it up. One of the things that impressed me so much here is how well Pollock is able to juggle multiple narrative threads, do each of them justice, and have them collide and intersect with one another in a convincing, satisfying way. He makes it look so easy. Of course it all comes together in the end, but I can't help but think how easily this could have been majorly flubbed, or how forced and deus ex machina it could have read in the hands of a lesser writer. This is a dark novel, full of dark deeds, it almost suffocates you. This is not a novel of redemption or hope but an unflinching look into the dark heart of man (and woman), bringing all the monsters that lurk there out into the light, into the open to be seen and feared. I found parts of this novel very difficult to read, and not because Pollock is explicit in his descriptions, because he isn\u2019t. He refrains from showing the reader everything, leaving room for what you can imagine -- and isn\u2019t that always worse? I know it is for me. He gives you just enough rope to hang yourself with. But his prose is vivid nevertheless, and there are scenes from this novel that I will never forget. Unlike Frank Bill's short story collection Crimes in Southern Indiana , Pollock injects an emotionality here and manages to humanize his characters even as he shows how monstrous they can be. While I absolutely loved Crimes, there is a humanity distinctly missing from Bill's characters -- the violence and hatred taking precedence over everything else. Pollock's writing here is closer to Woodrell's Winter's Bone, another outstanding piece of writing in this vein of small town, hardscrabble folk. All men represent the very best of their craft however, when it comes to capturing a sense of place and the people who live there. Unless he had whiskey running through his veins, Willard came to the clearing every morning and evening to talk to God. Arvin didn't know which was worse, the drinking or the praying.

generally my cup of tea, be they in fancy pants, shiny new hardcovers in the Literature section or shitty paperbacks in the mass-market rows of shame where all the bored housewives hang out. There seems to more often than not be this sort of straight to the point, unsalted cracker style to the writing which leaves me feeling dissatisfied. I mean, sure, I know some people in real life who parrot the same words and stories, use \"like\" and \"ummm\" as ways to pause in a sentence all the time, and tell a story using \"and then he said, and then she said, and then he was like, and then I was all like,\" etc. Then again, I'm not generally expecting to find myself seduced by words in real life considering that I work in a bar; a bar where I hear, and let's see if you get it, Toby Keith's \"I Love This Bar\" being played on the jukebox by a bar patron at least one time during every single shift. (Because we're in a bar! That you love! So you sing along! Every night! Ahhhhh, f*ck!) Wait, where was I? Right, genre fiction.As I was saying, there's this tendency in crime thrillers for purdy prose (and intricately constructed characters, for that matter) to be sacrificed in the service of increasing the plot's momentum, and if I'm being totally honest, I am a flowery, Wilde-loving bitch with her head (and wardrobe, and book/record collections) wedged firmly in the past. What can I say, I love me a good monologue. Despite all that, I'm trying to be better about reading things actually written during my lifetime, and this is one such attempt. So this is basically genre fiction, except it's actually really flippin' good. My gripe above does hold some weight here: there aren't any what you would call \"flabbergasting\" or \"groundbreaking\" revelations in this thing, and no immortal quotables to be stripped from the text. However, what there is is a whole lot of stacked, horrifying, and carefully placed imagery concerning savagery and the violent tendencies within all humans, rich to poor, spoiled to abandoned, male or female. The world holds many a charming tune for the snake within us all. Whether our motivations be sadistic, masochistic, righteous, vengeful, righteously vengeful, or just plain hormone-driven, we all carry this reptilian streak which, with the proper circumstantial nurturing, can lead to an explosion of unspeakable violence. All this is sorta old news, but Pollock handles it in a way that is engaging in more than just some torture porn way. He stirs up some feelings, and I mean more than just fear. Unlike all that horror movie stuff, this all feels...Real. Likely. Highly probable. Probably has happened pretty much this way somewhere at some time. I particularly enjoyed the approach that Pollock took concerning religion, addressing its uses as both a salve and a weapon, or more specifically as a justification for and refutation of violence and exploitation. These parts hit my Flannery bone, which is always a welcome injury. The first section of the book, which includes a truly grotesque sacrificial prayer altar depicted in graphic detail (think maggots, bones clanking in the wind, layers of blood on rotting, patchily-haired flesh driven through with nails and other types of general ick) was my favorite of the many eerie little stories in this interlocking collection of horrific events. The imagery throughout the novel, though described somewhat dryly, still manages to resonate. If this paragraph hasn't scared you away, then by all means GO! READ! IS GOOD! *Excluding movies, of course. Some of my all time favorite movies are gritty crime thrillers. Speaking of which, this would (will one day) make a great movie. My advice? Give it to Fincher."}, {"userName": "Steven  Godin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26706841-steven-godin", "userReview": "WOW!, reading this was like the equivalent of being sent to the electric chair and having your ashes blasted to the depths of hell!, everything is drenched in so much evil and suffering, the two serial killer lovers who hit the road looking for their next victim truly sent shivers down my spine, and there were many moments that really packed a nasty punch!. The thing that impressed me most was this could have turned into a standard horror/thriller but it's far more a human drama of hope and redemption, just happens to have a lot of nasty stuff happening as well.

In The Devil All the Time, Donald Ray Pollock has written a novel that marries the twisted intensity of Oliver Stone\u2019s Natural Born Killers with the religious and Gothic over\u00adtones of Flannery O\u2019Connor at her most haunting. Set in rural southern Ohio and West Virginia, The Devil All the Time follows a cast of compelling and bizarre characters from the end of World War II to the 1960s ...A few other books in this hillbilly-noir - genre comes to mind. Authors such as Cormack McCarthy, Peter Englund, John Steinbeck, Chris Offut, et al.I could not finish any of Cormack McCarthy's books, but with The Devil All the Time I simply could not put the book down, although I often could not decide if I wanted to puke from, or praise the actions of the characters. My conclusion was that it was brilliantly written. What a journey!There were no angels on this road. I suspect that even God might have had a few doubts from time to time. The author managed to humanize evil to such an extent that I wanted to jump up and down with joy for the anti-hero's actions, even urging him on! Now is THAT bizarre or what?The original religious seven deadliest sins (hubristic pride, greed, lust, malicious envy, gluttony, inordinate anger, and sloth) have been depicted in all forms of art. In The Devil All the Time the carnal collection takes glorious center stage in the now ghost town of Knockemstiff, southern Ohio.The three main stories:One:-- Private Willard Russell comes home to Coal Creek, West Virginia from WWII on a Greyhound bus, and stops over in a little paper mill town Meade, Ohio for refreshments at the Wooden Spoon. He falls in love with Charlotte, a beautiful waitress. He did not mind that the meat loaf was dry, the green beans were mushy, or the rolls as hard as a lump of #5 coal. With Charlotte serving the meal, it was the best one he ever had! Arriving home, his mother wants him to marry Helen, but Willard returns to the Wooden Spoon to find Charlotte and marry her. They have a perfectly normal son, Arvin Eugene. Willard did not want his family to live among the perverted degenerates in town. The country was going to hell in a hurry as it is. He developed a urgent need to pray for his family in case something bad might happen to his wife and son. He has not prayed for many years, neither could he connect with God in a cramped apartment or even in church. He finds the house on top of the Mitchell Flats which he rents for thirty dollars a month from the first class conniving prick of a lawyer called Henry Delano Dunlap, a plump girlish man with shiny immaculate fingernails and liver-colored lips. Willard will prove that poor people do not always want what the rich people have. He had one rehearsed prayer he repeats every month after his visit to the lawyer's office:  \"Thank you, God, for giving me the strength to keep my hands off Henry Dunlap's fat fucking neck. And let the sonofabitch have everything he wants in this life, though I got to confess, Lord, I sure wouldn't mind seeing him choke on it someday.\"  In the woods near their home, Willard set up a prayer log where he conducts sacrificial rituals and teaches Arvin to pray ...pray ... pray, goddamn it! Charlotte had cancer and God was not listening. \"Make Him hear you, you understand?\". Arvin prayed until his throat was raw and blistered. But though Arvin kept screaming for the Lord's mercy, he didn't feel anything and none came. Some of the people in Kockemstiff closed their windows, even with the heat. Others kept a light on the rest of the night, offered prayers on their own. A few days later Willard told Arvin: \" I am thinking we might take us a little trip. Go down and visit your grandma in Coal Creek. Maybe stay for a while. You can meet uncle Earskill, and that girl they got living with them would be just a little younger than you. You'll like it there.\"Thus begins Arvin's journey on the road where angels fear to tread and God makes a u-turn or two Himself ... Two:-- Willard's parents, Tom and Emma Russel, become the proteges of orphaned Helen Hatton, when her family is killed in a house fire. Emma has promised God that her son Willard will marry Helen if God brings him back alive from the war. There was one glitch though. Helen had a long, horsey face, wore wire-rim glasses set crooked on her long face, had a square chin and wore dirty bonnets. An odor of old sweat swirled around her which watered a passerby's eyes. Helen looked just like her grandmother Rachel, considered by many the homeliest woman who ever walked the ridges of Greenrier County. Emma knew, when Willard married Charlotte instead, that her promise was broken, and that God will turn the tables on her and her family, like He did with her husband Tom . Emma was a God-fearing woman, and Tom was a moonshiner with a little bit of bad luck in his past... Emma expected accidents or diseases hitting her family as a result of her broken promise. Edith Maxwell, over on Spud Run, had three pin headed blind children. However, when Helen announces her marriage, Emma was satisfied that God has forgiven her for her brief loss of trust. Helen marries a preacher, Brother Roy Laferty, who has a disabled sidekick, Brother Theodore Daniels. The two cousins, the fat boy in the wheelchair, Theo, and Roy, the tall skinny fellow, perform sermons with spiders and sad guitar music coming from Theodore's banged-up guitar in their effort to save some lost souls. It is the only way they could attract listeners to their traveling church. Helen was not scared of the spiders at all. \"Oh, don't worry,\" the girl said, as she started down off the porch, \"they ain't too bad once you get used to them.\" ...When one of the spiders bites Roy and leaves him for a couple of months stayed up in his closet with a swollen head, puffed up big as a pumpkin, he decides to join a traveling circus. But that was only after Helen disappears, leaving her perfectly normal daughter, Lenora, behind with Tom and Emma Russel. Roy and Theo mysteriously disappears as well. God is not always present when humans try to perform miracles ... and Lenora, poor thing, looked just like her mother ...Three-- Deputy Sheriff Leo Bodecker of Knockemstiff, a despicable, corrupt policeman, has a sister, Sandy. She marries a good-for-nothing photographer, Carl Henderson. Sandy also works at the Wooden Spoon, dishing out her sexual favors as a dessert to eager customers. Complaints is received and Deputy Bedecker has to act to save his re-election campaign. The Henderson couple also enjoys an annual road trip on various routes to find models for Carl's passion in photography ...I deliberately do not share the plot or give any clues to what happens to these people. That is for the reader to enjoy! I wanted to introduce the people behind their actions. Ordinary people with good intentions, until circumstances interfere. Who are we to cast the first stones, after all, right?These three stories enfold from the end of World War II to the 1960s. A bizarre chain of events, almost Gothic in nature, brings this tale to an even more bizarre ending, so outrageous, that even the reader is happily pouring encores on the anti-hero!It was a huge relief to close the book! I felt immensely happy to escape! I wanted to embrace my world and yell \"Oh how do I LOVE thee, let me count the ways!\" The narrative is filled with music, melody, magic. Drama, and tension keep the plot moving forward. Everything about this book is picturesque. Intense. Unbearably rich in scope, characters, background, meaning. The prose romanced my soul until the very end. There is a distinction between this author's writing style and all the others mentioned above. He brings warmth and compassion to his characters. The story also reminds me a lot of Tobacco Road by Erskine Caldwell. In fact, I would rather compare it with this classic gem than any other authors's works. The story has that same depth of human spirit to it. It is certainly one of the highlights in my reading life and hopefully it will become one of the American greatest reads of all times.ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4677640-richard", "userReview": "*4.5 Stars*Sometimes I find it difficult to put into words what I really liked about a particular book. This novel is one of those. It's a nihilistic portrait of rural life in Ohio and West Virginia for a disparate group of fucked up individuals as they struggle to not only survive within the parameters that life and fate has stuck them with, but also with their own inherent impulses and desires. It's an admirable, well-conceived debut novel that is brutal but manages to not feel gratuitous. The novel's strength lies in it's prose, it's ideas, the attention to detail, it's imagery (the \"church\" in the woods...whoa) and highly intricate characters that are both appalling and captivating. You can't help but get swept up in their miserable lives to see where they go next. All of this combines to create a heavy mood and atmosphere that Pollock evokes with his simple but precise prose. It's an atmosphere that's distinctive and one that I haven't experienced in many other books.

To prove their faith they kill with all intentions of bringing back to life but are rocked when it fails.\u00a0And one young man who at the age of 8 witnessed the death of his mother and his father's daily battle with the devil, an unseen madness and a desire to never be separated from the wife he loved so much. We see Arvin\u2019s life unfold, a calculating young man who could take his time enacting revenge on the bullies that plagued him and his orphan sister. Living with his grandmother, death follows this boy like an unrelenting nightmare and he certainly doesn't hold back when faced with the ultimate decision and vengeance.\u00a0These characters will meet at the end and not all of them will live to tell the tale.\u00a0Now there's a lot of movement in this story, by that I mean we switch between a number of characters over a number of years. Not all the characters we get to know, quite deeply in some cases, are in it for the long run or even the endgame. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, there's plenty of time spent developing characters that advance the story in most cases but are set purely for the metaphorical chopping block.\u00a0The thing I liked about this was the distinct lack of morality everywhere, there's very little light in any of these characters. Every one of them is deeply flawed, occasionally honest but there actions are of darkness, murder even for widely differing reasons is still murder, deserved though it may be in some cases. These kill, some as a hobby, others for necessity and this story is dark and dirty and riddled with death, unsavoury people where there really shouldn't be and you can't trust any of them.\u00a0So I did enjoy this but there was just something missing that stopped me giving it full marks. Difficult to put my finger on it, maybe the amount of attention given to Roy and Theodore, who didn't really grab me at all. Also it was fairly easy to guess where the story was going and the ending saw no great surprises but on the whole not a million miles away from being right up my dark little street.\u00a0I'll leave you with quote from Roy.\u00a0\"Before I found the Holy Ghost, I was scared plumb to death of spiders. Ain\u2019t that right, Theodore? Ever since I was a little runt hiding under my mother\u2019s long skirts. Spiders crawled through my dreams and laid eggs in my nightmares, and I couldn\u2019t even go to the outhouse without someone holding my hand. They was hanging in their webs everywhere waiting on me. It was an awful way to live, in fear all the time, awake or asleep, it didn\u2019t matter. And that\u2019s what hell is like, brothers and sisters. I never got no rest from them eight-legged devils. Not until I found the Lord\".\u00a0And there is a one armed bootlegger nicknamed Slot-machine, quality.Also posted at http://paulnelson.booklikes.com/post/..."}, {"userName": "Tressa ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226335-tressa", "userReview": "If you're a fan of crime fiction and don't mind when it bleeds over into southern gothic, then do not miss Donald Ray Pollock's first novel, The Devil All the Time. Critics and readers are comparing his work about the sinning and redemption that takes place by sweaty characters in small hick towns to Flannery O'Connor's. That's a spot-on comparison, especially if compared to O'Connor's novels Wise Blood and The Violent Bear It Away, but I would add that some of the more repugnant scenes remind me of my first\u2014and only\u2014Erskine Caldwell book: Tobacco Road.

Willard returns from his tour of duty in the South Pacific, unable to shake the image of a skinned and crucified soldier\u2014very much alive\u2014he came across one day on patrol. Tortured by nightmares of his war experience, he gets many years of reprieve when he falls hard for and marries a gentle waitress named Charlotte; they have a son together named Arvin Eugene, who becomes the hub of the story. When Charlotte gets cancer, the devout Willard tries to cure her through prayer. When Charlotte's cancer spreads, Willard makes more visits to the prayer log in the woods near his house, taking along young Arvin to pray until he's hoarse, too. As the cancer eats away at his beloved wife, the desperate Willard begins supplementing his prayers with animal sacrifice, starting small and progressing to sheep and dogs.Going on the premise that every one of us must fight the \"devil all the time,\" Pollock shows how some of us, though we may lose the fight, are more conflicted about it when we do. Spanning the years from the mid-1940s to the mid-'60s, in Knockemstiff, Ohio, and West Virginia, residents of these towns cross paths, double-cross each other, and sometimes manage to rescue each other, at least for a short time. A sampling of the residents you'll meet include husband and wife serial killers who scour the area looking for \"models\" to photograph; a traveling preacher and his jealous wheelchair-bound companion; a dandy preacher who enjoys defiling young ladies in his congregation; and a sheriff sucked into the corruption on his beat. The gritty The Devil All the Time has made it onto my Favorite Books of 2012 list.Meet the Author: Doesn't he have the face of someone who'd write a book like this? And the name to go along with it? He also has the background, too. It may surprise you to know that Knockemstiff is the name of a real town\u2014well, holler\u2014in Ohio. Donald Ray Pollock dropped out of school at 17 to work in a meatpacking plant, then spent 32 years at a paper mill. His life does get better. He's still married to his first wife, and he graduated from college in 2009 and published the short story collection Knockemstiff, which earned the 2009 PEN/Robert Bingham Fellowship. Can't wait to see what Donald Ray writes next.

That's what happened with me and The Devil All the Time. I'm going to let this book sink in and I may write a review, but I don't think I can do it justice. A perfect book from start to finish; every character rings true; every sad story comes full circle. Do not pass up this gritty, small-town gothic or you will miss some great storytelling."}, {"userName": "Andrew Smith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith", "userReview": "Dark story and even darker characters. This has (for me) a fair helping of Daniel Woodrell's country noir about it. Some of the players in this tale are good and some are just plain bad. But even in the good characters badness lives just below the surface. There's not a lot of hope here. That is unles you think the ending promises some sort of redemption. I loved this book. It's superbly written without a glimpse of a spare word.

The blurb says that Donald Ray Pollock ...marries the twisted intensity of Oliver Stone\u2019s Natural Born Killers with the religious and Gothic over\u00adtones of Flannery O\u2019Connor. I've never read Flannery O'Connor, but definitely agree with the NBK comparison. The cast of characters mostly range from mad to hopeless to just plain evil. Some I felt some empathy for (they are driven to their deeds by loss or just lack of intelligence), but some disturbed me on a very deep level. The author writes so visually that it really feels like I saw the movie, I can see things that weren't even described in detail in the book (I so wish I could wipe those photos from my mind). Although, I'm making it sound like a difficult read, I couldn't put it down, and finished it in one day. I will be reading more by this brilliant author, but for now I need a palate cleanser.The Story: In the backwoods of Ohio, Willard Russell\u2019s wife is succumbing to cancer, no matter how much he drinks, prays, or sacrifices animals at his \u201cprayer log.\u201d Meanwhile, his son Arvin is growing up, from a kid bullied at school into a man who knows when to take action.

Arvin didn't know which was worse, the drinking or the praying. As far back as he could remember, it seemed that his father had fought the Devil all the time. If you're looking for a piece of southern literature full of sunny people who live nothing but the good life you'll want to steer clear of this book; it's not for the faint of heart. Imagine you're about to eat a delicious cheese hamburger with all the fixings, but the meat is raw; that's this book. Though the writing was decent, I don't think I've ever encountered a more disturbing lot of characters. Arvin is about the only one with any redeeming qualities.

In The Devil All the Time, Donald Ray Pollock has written a novel that marries the twisted intensity of Oliver Stone\u2019s Natural Born Killers with the religious and Gothic over\u00adtones of Flannery O\u2019Connor at her most haunting. Set in rural southern Ohio and West Virginia, The Devil All the Time follows a cast of compelling and bizarre characters from the end of World War II to the 1960s. There\u2019s Willard Russell, tormented veteran of the carnage in the South Pacific, who can\u2019t save his beautiful wife, Charlotte, from an agonizing death by cancer no matter how much sacrifi\u00adcial blood he pours on his \u201cprayer log.\u201d There\u2019s Carl and Sandy Henderson, a husband-and-wife team of serial kill\u00aders, who troll America\u2019s highways searching for suitable models to photograph and exterminate. There\u2019s the spider-handling preacher Roy and his crippled virtuoso-guitar-playing sidekick, Theodore, running from the law. And caught in the middle of all this is Arvin Eugene Russell, Willard and Charlotte\u2019s orphaned son, who grows up to be a good but also violent man in his own right. Donald Ray Pollock braids his plotlines into a taut narrative that will leave readers astonished and deeply moved. With his first novel, he proves himself a master storyteller in the grittiest and most uncompromising American grain.", "title": "The Devil All the Time", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10108463.The_Devil_All_the_Time", "average": 4.1, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320561517l/10108463.jpg", "reviews": 1791, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/784866.Donald_Ray_Pollock", "name": "Donald Ray Pollock"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Horror", "Mystery", "Historical", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10108463-the-devil-all-the-time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12992927-the-devil-all-the-time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12159229-the-devil-all-the-time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21957740-sempre-o-diabo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23343639", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1704719.Knockemstiff", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27245902-the-heavenly-table", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17431514-hair-s-fate-knockemstiff", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17431513-dynamite-hole-real-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17431520-blessed-the-fights"]}
