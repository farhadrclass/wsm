Kudos to her. It's always a fascinating read to hear stories of mysticism in every day life. The tension created by the skeptic in me and the spiritual side of me gets an adventurous work out, which is always fun. Also, having grown up Catholic, in South Florida, I had always heard \"scary\" stories about Santeria. It was great to see the life of a Santera revealed in a down-to-earth, pull-back-the-curtain kind of way - all while keeping the mystical aspect of it in tact."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1357288-monica", "userReview": "Didn't want to finish it. Enjoyed it. Felt like I went on a journey with her. I miss the orishas. I had done some work with them in the mid '90s, in the Lucumi tradition, not Santeria, but similar. Had a reading where I was told I had to choose: either Lucumi or European paganism/witchcraft. I went with witchcraft, for various reasons. But I still feel a connection with the orishas, and it was nice to read a story about initiation into the tradition."}, {"userName": "Jasmine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2951417-jasmine", "userReview": "So good!

I didn't go into it with the highest of expectations, and while it's deeply flawed I did find myself enjoying it more than I thought I might. The book is quite obviously a very thinly veiled novelization of the author's own faith journey, written with all the enthusiasm of the newly converted, which at times is energizing and at others embarrassing.The book tells the story of Gabrielle Segovia, a marine biologist and college professor who is struggling with her own infertility. She doesn't give much thought to religion until she gets a reading on a whim in a voodoo shop while at a conference in New Orleans, and she is so shaken by what she hears that she makes contact with family members she hasn't seen since childhood who she knows to be involved with Santeria. She begins the process of being inducted into the family religion while struggling deeply with what her coworkers will think of her if they ever learn that she practices an ancestral religion complete with animal sacrifices. The book shines in giving an even, respectful introduction to a secretive and often misunderstood religion; we learn a lot about the gods and get a taste of some of the rituals. However, the author being a convert herself, she is obviously invested in putting Santeria is the best possible light both for her readers and for herself; predictions are clearly stated and always come true, no matter how skeptical Gabrielle may be upon hearing each one. Overall, the book is not terribly well written and would have little to recommend itself if it were a novel about a better-known religion. However, the subject matter itself is interesting enough to make up for a good percentage of these shortcomings. I wouldn't go so far as to recommend this book to anyone, but I got what I was looking for out of it and didn't regret my decision to read it."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1841419-kevin", "userReview": "Originally, I didn't have very high hopes for the book. The Spanish dialog being used between the character just seemed too forced. It may have been intended to add extra credibility to the \"latina\" main character, but it ended up making me feel something in between alienation and annoyance, since I only know a very small amount of Spanish, myself.As the book progressed, though, there was a bit less Spanish and I could focus on the plot.There were a few parts that I couldn't quite relate to -- getting a reading by a santero without knowing anything about Santeria, receiving Orisha so soon after being exposed to the religion, etc. A lot of it dealt with Ifa, which I only know the smallest little bit about. That was actually good, though, I think... If it was about Lucumi or one of the traditions I know more about, I might get distracted from the story due to differences in tradition, beliefs, etc.There was also a lot of it, though, that I could definitely relate to. That was probably what I liked most. Being able to look back at an event and know I wasn't the only one to think certain things... or even just seeing how things played out differently for the main character versus for me. It made it easier a lot easier to get wrapped into the book.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to anyone -- whether they have any ties to the religion or not."}, {"userName": "Deb", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/220128-deb", "userReview": "Gabriela is a Latina, Has a PhD in marine biology & was raised Catholic but hasn't been to Church for years. She also really wants a child but has been avoiding her husband suggestions that try fertility. She hates doctors, go figure. On a conference trip to New Orleans, her best friend drags her into the Marie Leveau voodoo shop and she gets a reading on a whim. This is the first step that leads he to reconnecting with relatives in Miami who follow Santeria and then to becoming an iniate herself. It's not an easy path: she struggles to reconcile science and religion, her husband is not, at first, supportive of her new explorations, the animal sacrifices upset her, and she fears scorn and worse from her colleagues at the university. I liked this book because it presents Santeria as a spiritual path like any other, albeit one practiced with discretion, rather than as fodder for a Roger Corman movie. It also a way for the initiates to connect more deeply with their cultural roots bck to West Africa. The approach is almost prosaic, avoiding any sensationalizing or \"woo woo\" spookiness."}, {"userName": "George", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/243419-george", "userReview": "An interesting book if not a great one. It's clearly inspired by the author's own life,if not perhaps exactly autobiographical. But in many respects, at least to me, it felt superficial. I don't come away from it really understanding its belief system or with any real feeling for it as a faith, or what it feels like to actually experience its practice. We do get to see some rituals and learn a bit about them and that's not without interest, but it doesn't feel like enough. Early on, the protagonist gets a series of predictions which of course all too predictably come true. There is some evidence of struggle between her scientific rational beliefs and her growing attraction to Santeria, but not a great deal that really explains that attraction in any satisfactory way, assuming her rational belief system was well grounded to begin with. Santeria works for her on various levels, but that's about all I really know at the end."}, {"userName": "Susie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/574260-susie", "userReview": "I found the discussions of santeria and the related rituals interesting, but I felt throughout that the novel was too autobiographical. I don't know why that annoyed me, but it did. Also, you would be pretty confused reading this if you have had no exposure to written Spanish...much of the dialogue is bilingual--and even though there is a glossary in the back of the book, and many phrases are translated within the chapters, an English-only reader would have trouble understanding many of the italicized parts. (For the record, I do not consider myself able to read Spanish, but have studied just enough to follow along for most parts of the book.)I liked this book, but mainly because I learned about a new religion I had no prior knowledge of. I didn't particularly care about the characters or the plot, and the writing was just \"okay.\""}, {"userName": "Matt Price", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14830905-matt-price", "userReview": "It's a little pedantic and promotional on behalf of those practicing this religion. In other words, it is not a critical examination of the beliefs and practices, but assumes a certain inevitability in how practitioners are recruited, mainly due to genealogical and ethnic criteria. Disappointed in how the deus ex machina conveniently navigated our protagonist along an obvious plot line. It seems little goes wrong for which the Old Religion can't provide the exact response necessary to the story without little struggle or reflection for the characters. Helpful insider's perspective, though, especially for the description of some of the rituals (there are some excerpts abruptly cut from the narrative) and the depiction of initiating its priests, for this reason alone I would recommend it."}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2911320-kristi", "userReview": "Garbrielle Segovia is a Latina scientist who turns to Yoruba religion (Afro-Cuban) in an effort to have a child, after some miscarriages.

Becoming a santera is not in her plans.But everything changes when her best friend, the feisty Patricia Mu\u00f1oz, drags her into a French Quarter voodoo shop during a conference in New Orleans. When Gabrielle gets home to the San Francisco Bay Area, the predictions from her on-a-whim reading begin to come true. That\u2019s when she learns she hails from a long line of practitioners of Santeria, the religion created when Yoruba slaves combined their ancient rituals with Catholicism.Out of desperation to become a mother and save both her job and her marriage, Gabrielle turns to Puerto Rican relatives living in Miami she hasn\u2019t seen since she was a child. She finds herself warmly embraced by three generations of Segovia santeras and drawn into their world of s\u00e9ances, sacred drums, and ritual animal sacrifice.Unexpectedly marked for initiation by the gods and goddesses of the Yoruba pantheon, Gabrielle must decide whether she can bring herself to answer the call. And, if she chooses, commit to the seemingly contradictory life of a scientist who is also a santera.In this powerful debut novel, Irete Lazo captures a vibrant world still unknown to many and relates a journey that is at once funny, heart-wrenching, and, ultimately, triumphant.", "title": "The Accidental Santera: A Novel", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4443534-the-accidental-santera", "average": 3.78, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1425109674l/4443534.jpg", "reviews": 21, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1856071.Irete_Lazo", "name": "Irete Lazo"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Spirituality"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4443534-the-accidental-santera", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
