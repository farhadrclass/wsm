It looks at how these identities have evolved and what they mean to individuals. With an excellent forward by Joan Nestle and two fantastic editors--Zena Sharman and Ivan E Coyote--I was very excited for this anthology. As a young person in Vancouver, Coyote's novels represented an universe I dreamed of accessing. I remembered the euphoria at seeing how my high school librarians loved them. However, it took me this long to finally pick up a Coyote. Or rather, an anthology edited by them. Coyote's two essays did not disappoint, nor did Sharman's essay. I thoroughly enjoyed others as well. There were some ones that were either chalk full of transphobia or painful liberalism, so I cannot think to rate this above three stars. Despite essays in this anthology contradicting others and some frustrating as hell reads, the beauty of this anthology is not lost on me. I recommend all femmes, butches, bois, and masc-of-centre Canadians read this. While it does include American writers, I do think the experience is enhanced when you are Canadian (as most of the writers are and because it's so lovely to find a Canadian LGBTQ piece of literature). Overall, a satisfying read that taught me a lot and made me reconsider what I know about femme and butch."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120129-rachel", "userReview": "There were a small handful of essays that I really loved and more that actually made me pretty uncomfortable or angry, like the ones that argued that cis women femmes are \"straight-passing\" or that butches and femme men are the only people transgressing gender."}, {"userName": "Journey", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16447457-journey", "userReview": "with something so heavily theorized, it's nice to get personal narratives; but then, personal narratives can also be just as grating, self-indulgent, and/or obnoxious as theory sometimes. I liked a handful of these essays: Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha is a wonderful, powerful, smart writer; Victoria Brownworth's commentary on how lesbian identities in the mainstream are being so straightwashed, and the forcing of lesbians to be viewed as sexually available to men, is extremely important; I also enjoyed Sasha T. Goldberg's and Chandra Mayor's pieces, and while I wasn't personally drawn to their essays, Amy Fox's and Elizabeth Marston's inclusion are notable. that said... now there's a whole lot of essays left that I don't like and/or find terrible. There's the inclusion of a self-centered misogynist (who will go unnamed... their essay in the book may not be so grossly misogynist -- I refuse to read it -- but they sure are on their popular blog); the debatable inclusion of people who are not queer women (by which I mean men); blaming feminism for setting back butch identification by the feminist practice of hating all things male/masculine (Ivan Coyote in the introduction, and also Jeanne Cordova in \"The New Politics of Butch\"); offering these identities up to cis straight people (\"Rogue Femininity\"); and then there's the bizarre essay where a gay man talks about doing lesbian porn with his bisexual woman friend -- no, you identify as a man, she identifies as a woman, that is not lesbian in any way!I wish there was a place for people to read the essays individually, because the essays that are good are really good, but I'm not sure that they're good enough to justify buying the whole thing in all its messy undefined glory.p.s. alright, I'll admit \"Hats Off\" still gives me butterflies sometimes."}, {"userName": "Kat Heatherington", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/844556-kat-heatherington", "userReview": "brilliant anthology. this collection of personal stories is thoughtful, relevant, insightful and frequently powerful. anyone interested in gender studies will find a goldmine of valuable material in this book. my one criticism is the same criticism i have for most gender studies books: where the heck are the bisexuals? in only a small selection of these essays is bisexuality mentioned or addressed. i valued those essays that much more for including us. on the whole, however, this book is incredibly well-written, and covers a wide range of ideas and responses to gender performativity and experience."}, {"userName": "Jaysen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66583173-jaysen", "userReview": "Actual rating: 2.5-2.7, maybeI always like to think about what audience the author had in mind when I\u2019m reading something, whether it be a short story, essay, or full-length novel. While reading this, I struggled with that question.I identify as a non-binary gay person, \u201cqueer\u201d when I\u2019m feeling extra radical, and I identified with a couple of the stories in this, especially the first few (shoutout to \u201cHome/Sickness: Self-Diagnosis\u201d by romham padraig gallacher!) . But as I kept reading, they begun to feel...for lack of a better word, basic. By that I mean that a lot of the pieces started feeling repetitive, and some seemed like they were written for people who had never had a conversation with a lesbian before, butch, femme or otherwise. I started skimming after Ivan E. Coyote\u2019s \u201cA Butch Roadmap\u201d, and by the time I got to Nairine Holtz\u2019s \u201cSlide Rules\u201d I found myself completely skipping a lot of the entries. Apparently, that was for the best, because some of my fellow LGBT goodreaders have noted that some of the essays are a little...dated, to put it mildly, downright problematic to put it extra spicy. Many of the writers, it seems, grew up in the 60s/70s/80s, so are very much products of their time - in other words, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised that some of them have separatist, or outright TERFy rhetoric, but that doesn\u2019t mean I should have to suffer through that when I\u2019m reading a book I was so excited about at first.This has been in my \u201cwant to read\u201d for a while and I finally got it as a gift for the holidays, so I felt like I had to read through the whole thing but, honestly, it was a little meh. When I really enjoy a book, I simply can\u2019t put it down, but trying to get through 310-pages of essays that started feeling interchangeable 1/3 of the way through felt like getting my teeth pulled. Still, I\u2019m giving it three stars because some of the pieces were very good, but some of them couldve been omitted. The \u201cAlways Butch and Femme\u201d subtitle implies that we\u2019d be getting a wide variety of engagement with butch and femme identities, but many of the stories, like I said, were very similar. Perhaps this would\u2019ve been a lot better if the book itself, as well as many of the entries, were shorter.To save anyone reading this some trouble, my faves were:\u201cRide\u201d\u201cComing Back Around to Butch\u201d\u201cA Dad Called Mum\u201d\u201cNever Be Hungry Again\u201d\u201cHome/Sick: Self-Diagnosis\u201d\u201cLooking Straight At You\u201d\u201cA Butch Roadmap\u201d\u201cFemme Shark Manifesto!\u201d"}, {"userName": "Jean Roberta", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/783256-jean-roberta", "userReview": "This thick collection of essays and manifestoes, with some poems, short fiction and brief autobiographies mixed in, is a current report on the diversity of queer gender identities in the twenty-first century. Its title is similar to that of an earlier book, The Persistent Desire: A Femme-Butch Reader, originally published in 1992. Joan Nestle, a legendary femme writer who remembers the early Gay Rights movement, edited the first anthology. As she says in the foreword to the current book:\"When Ivan and Zena told me of their soon-to-be-published collection, which you now hold in your hands, I did not react well.\" As she explains, the title seemed too close to that of her own book. However, Nestle eventually calmed down. She came to believe that the current book, like the earlier one, represents a certain zeitgeist:\"The voices of another generation, of other cultural positions, new possibilities of gender discourse, and erotic adventuring are presented here, and these extend in complex ways the passionate and embattled conversation of the now out-of-print Persistent Desire.\"The cover image of the current paperback says it all: a drawing of an androgynous-looking brown person of unclear ethnicity seems to be looking into a mirror as s/he applies lipstick (fuschia, slightly darker than the pink background) to her/his full lips. This person is either contemplating her (?) own image or that of the viewer. The artist, Elisha Lim, has said with lines and colour what the other contributors say in many words.All the pieces in this book are worth reading, but some more than others. Besides Joan Nestle, lesbians of the Old Guard (who were \u201cout\u201d in the era of the Stonewall Riots of 1969) are represented by Jewelle Gomez, Victoria Brownworth and Jeanne Cordova. These voices from a time when butch and femme identities seemed mandatory in most gay/lesbian bars all lament the attempt of the lesbian-feminism of the 1970s/80s to simply erase \u201csex roles\u201d as relics of patriarchal thinking. They also comment on the \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of the LGBT community in our time, and the effect this has had on gender identity. In \u201cA Butch Roadmap,\u201d editor Ivan E. Coyote writes movingly of her/his sense of being exiled by the Pride Committee of Winnipeg, when they tried to make Pride Week \u201cfamily friendly\u201d by banning \u201cextremists,\u201d including drag queens and butch women. Among the younger contributors, there are quite a few Canadians. This is probably not surprising for a publication from a Canadian press, but it seems unusual for the topic. Zoe Whittall (award-winning novelist who writes about 20-somethings in Toronto) brilliantly contrasts an older (more closeted) butch writer with a younger (more comfortable with Facebook) femme writer on a book tour in a short story, \u201cA Patch of Bright Flowers.\u201d The argument between the two writers serves as foreplay, and they agree not to write about what will happen between them after the hotel-room door closes in the last paragraph.Another award-winning Toronto writer, Nairne Holtz, writes sensibly about being the femme in a long-term relationship with a lover who is sometimes mistaken for a man. In her essay, \u201cSlide Rules,\u201d she says: \u201cWhat makes one person butch and another femme in a couple is hard to pin down yet easy to recognize.\u201d A third award-winning Canadian novelist, Amber Dawn, writes movingly about being both femme and a sex worker in \u201cTo All the Butches I Loved Between 1995 and 2005: An Open Letter about Selling Sex, Selling Out, and Soldiering on.\u201dJeanne Cordova includes a graph named \u201cA Post-Trans Butch Continuum\u201d after referring to Karl Marx\u2019s comment that technology defines the direction of social change. In her youth, even the most masculine of female-born people could not have defined themselves as transmen because transitioning from female to male via hormones and surgery just wasn\u2019t possible then. Some of the contributors seem so gender-fluid (including Elaine Miller, who coins the term \u201cfutch\u201d for someone who is femme and butch by turns or simultaneously) that the exact meaning of \u201cfemme\u201d or \u201cbutch\u201d in their conceptual worlds seems unclear, as is their difference from 1970s lesbian-feminists who advocated androgyny for all. Perhaps the difference between old-style androgyny and new-style genderqueerness has to do with acceptance of those whose conception of a \u201clesbian lifestyle\u201d is different from one\u2019s own.The \u201cFEMME SHARK MANIFESTO!\u201d (in capital letters) by Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha is a rousing call-to-arms and a definition of fierce, queer femininity: \u201cFEMME SHARKS WILL RECLAIM THE POWER AND DIGNITY OF FEMALENESS BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. WE\u2019RE GIRLS BLOWN UP, TURNED INSIDE OUT, AND REMIXED.\u201d This piece is notably anti-racist as well as anti-misogynist.Space does not allow me to do justice to this book. It needs to be read aloud, discussed and debated. It will not be the last word on gender identity in lesbian space, but it seems unlikely to be become outdated any time soon. It covers a very large territory, both geographically and philosophically.--------------------------------"}, {"userName": "Margaret Adams", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4356001-margaret-adams", "userReview": "Picked up a copy of this at my friend Dave\u2019s house in Santa Barbara \u2013 never met the roommate who it belonged to.

I did like a few of the pieces a lot, though, especially the descriptive and as I said narrative pieces. Made me think of the representations of butch and femme identities I'd like to see in more media.

The result is Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme. The stories in these pages resist simple definitions. The people in these stories defy reductive stereotypes and inflexible categories. The pages in this book describe the lives of an incredible diversity of people whose hearts also pounded for some reason the first time they read or heard the words \"butch\" or \"femme.\"Contributors such as Jewelle Gomez (The Gilda Stories), Thea Hillman (Intersex), S. Bear Bergman (Butch is a Noun), Chandra Mayor (All the Pretty Girls), Amber Dawn (Sub Rosa), Anna Camilleri (Brazen Femme), Debra Anderson (Code White), Anne Fleming (Anomaly), Michael V. Smith (Cumberland), and Zoe Whittall (Bottle Rocket Hearts) explore the parameters, history, and power of a multitude of butch and femme realities. It's a raucous, insightful, sexy, and sometimes dangerous look at what the words butch and femme can mean in today\u2019s ever-shifting gender landscape, with one eye on the past and the other on what is to come.Includes a foreword by Joan Nestle, renowned femme author and editor of The Persistent Desire: A Femme-Butch Reader, a landmark anthology originally published in 1992.Ivan E. Coyote is the author of seven books (including the novel Bow Grip, an American Library Association Stonewall Honor Book) and a long-time muser on the trappings of the two-party gender system.Zena Sharman is the assistant director of Canada's national Institute of Gender and Health.", "title": "Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9475378-persistence", "average": 4.04, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327894653l/9475378.jpg", "reviews": 60, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/179047.Ivan_E_Coyote", "name": "Ivan E.
