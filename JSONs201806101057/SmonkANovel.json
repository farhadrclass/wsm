O. Smonk. Syphilitic, consumptive, gouty and goitered, Smonk is also an expert with explosives and knives. He abhors horses, goats and the Irish. Every Saturday night for a year he's been riding his mule into Old Texas, destroying property, killing livestock, seducing women, cheating and beating men all from behind the twin barrels of his Winchester 45-70 caliber over and under rifle. At last the desperate citizens of the town, themselves harboring a terrible secret, put Smonk on trial, with disastrous and shocking results. Thus begins the highly anticipated new novel from Tom Franklin, acclaimed author of Hell at the Breech and Poachers.Smonk is also the story of Evavangeline, a fifteen-year-old prostitute quick to pull a trigger or cork. A case of mistaken identity plunges her into the wild sugarcane country between the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers, land suffering from the worst drought in a hundred years and plagued by rabies. Pursued by a posse of unlikely vigilantes, Evavangeline boats upriver and then wends through the dust and ruined crops, forced along the way to confront her own clouded past. She eventually stumbles upon Old Texas, where she is fated to E. O. Smonk and the townspeople in a way she could never imagine.In turns hilarious, violent, bawdy and terrifying, Smonk creates its own category: It's a southern, not a western, peopled with corrupt judges and assassins, a cuckolded blacksmith, Christian deputies, widows, War veterans, whores, witches, madmen and zombies. By the time the smoke has cleared, the mystery of Smonk will be revealed, the survivors changed forever. My Review: Oh! Oh, I see...THIS is what y'all were on about when y'all were carryin' on over Franklin's writing. It surely to hell couldn't've been that crooked mess. That was painful.Eugene Oregon Smonk is as horrible a character as Ignatius Reilly. He's as gross, as grotesque, as cruel, and as massively hilariously vile. Smonk suffers from gout, so he's already ten yards ahead of everybody else in the book in my good graces. He's got terminal consumption, too. (I don't have that.) He's bowlegged, he hates horses, he detests people. He's murdered and raped and generally been as much like Attila as a modern man can be.Evavangeline is fifteen, a whore, and mean as a butt-fucked polecat. She doesn't know what \u201cthank you\u201d means, she's got no idea what impulse control is, and she expresses her displeasure with johns who don't pay up (I refuse to reach for the cheap joke inherent in \u201cstiff her\u201d) in most-often fatal ways.And these, laddies and gentlewomen, are our heroes.Yeup. This book, it's as much fun to read as a William S. Burroughs novel edited by Roger Corman. It's got energy. It's got no time for sacred, for nice, for sweet. It's got no place for normal, for kindly, for restrained. (Unless you mean \u201ctied up for sex.\u201d) It is, in short, a book for the boisterous and the bawdy, not the timorous and the tidy.I totally get the Franklin thing now. That crookedy crapola? That's nothing much, it's no doubt what happened when some longfaced Puritan somewhere started biting Franklin behind the ear after this book came out. He should slap her into next Sunday and go back to Smonking. This genre-busting carnival of louche and salacious and violent living is far far far more interesting and better written.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Here are a few words you could use to describe Smonk Depraved disgusting debased debauched degraded scabrous malevolent syphilitic grotesque graphic gross gory gouty goitered violent horrible cruel mean very violent have I already said that shameless vicious vile putridAnd there are no doubt others along those lines.

Smonk worried me. Several times I feared I would injure myself laughing. I was also worried that members of an unnamed disease cult would butcher me. Tom Franklin has a sense of pitch which astonishes me. No doubt his craven Christian is named Portis for obvious reasons. I liked that touch. Enclosed in the back of the novel was a receipt. I treasure such discoveries. This instance provided a delightful portal. The receipt was from a bookstore in Chicago where I bought this novel nearly five years ago to the day (from today). We were in town to see our friends and that evening we were going to see Manu Chao. The humidity was hellish. I spotted this store, begged apologies and ran within. It is is strange that it took me five years to meet Mr. E.O. Smonk.

If you prefer a slice of the old South, 2003's Hell at the Breach , while super violent, is just a terrific (and terrifying) fictional account of a real skirmish in South Alabama. If the old stuff doesn't float your boat, Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter : part thriller, part examination of race relations in today's Mississippi. If you're a Cormac McCarthy fan (an author that Franklin cites as an influence on his Goodreads profile page), you may want to give Smonk a try. Anyone that knows me at all on here is probably done hearing my rants on McCarthy's annoying penchant for ditching quotation marks. Not only does Frankin try with  Smonk to emulate McCarthy, it's almost like he's trying to purposely out-McCarthy McCarthy here, right up to ditching the quotes and adding as much violent imagery and degredation as possible. The violence is so gruesome here it's almost comedy (and is hilarious, if your tolerance for said base behavior is high.) What I cannot understand: why Franklin felt compelled to completely copy McCarthy's style. He'd already established his own distinctive style before 2006's  Smonk, why make an overt attempt to emulate McCarthy? - Smonk's complete title  Smonk, or, Widow Town: being the scabrous adventures of EO Smonk & of the Whore Evavangelina in Clarke County, Alabama, early in the last century pretty much gives you the idea that this is not going to be your typical western. Nope, not by a long shot. From the git-go, you know this Smonk guy is one bad (and disgusting) dude. We see him hauled into court in Old Texas, AL with a laundry list of offenses, from prostitution to murder.(not to mention he's begoitered and has a glass eye that pops out at inopportune moments). We find out quickly why Old Texas becomes known as Widow Town (as you might intuit, Smonk pretty much mows down the male populace of the town.) and also find out the role of the Whore Evavangelina (it's not exactly for comic relief as that cumbersome name might indicate). Despite this being an overt McCarthy smackdown of sorts, and disgustingly violent, I still liked this, just nowhere near as much as  Hell at the Breach. There are threshholds of violence one can endure when that violence becomes so pervasive it turns into parody. I'd really only recommend  Smonk  for die-hard Franklin fans (with iron constitutions); otherwise, avoid this and read anything else of his. But make sure you do read  something of his.

Although Smonk himself is appalling and amusing at the same time, I found much more delight in other's stories about him - his history and superstitions. But my favorite character was Walton, the leader of the Christian Deputies, who as a northerner felt a personal mission to bring morality back to the South. Franklin created such harsh imagery that I couldn't help imaging the landscape in black and burnt oranges/reds - the scorched earth and dead dogs.
