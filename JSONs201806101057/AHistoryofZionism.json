For the first time, I managed to look at Zionism and the Zionist state through semi-neutral eyes. Full of details, written almost on an encyclopedic scale, it is bound to have some repititions as the author tell the story and retells concentrating on each aspect of it. I will keep this book in my library as a landmark in my journey of mental cultivation. I am still an ardent opponant to the Zionist state, not just because it is based on a form of religion, but because it is a colonial power with no legal or logical justification for its existence. However A History of Zionism has helped me understand the moving forces behind it since the early beginnings of its movement."}, {"userName": "Mark Hoffman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17178999-mark-hoffman", "userReview": "Dry as a bone, but I dare you to find a more thorough overview of Zionism."}, {"userName": "Harold Citron", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17198521-harold-citron", "userReview": "A long and detailed walk through the development of political Zionism in its myriad forms, following the emergence of Herzl through the founding of the modern Jewish state of Israel. The book provides the reader with not just the marriage between the religious vision of Judaism with the emergent political landscape of emancipation that led to the idea of Jews becoming enablers of their own fate, but the deep wells of anti-Semitism that both created the need for a haven from the growing violence, and ultimately how the movement, both its leaders and masses, were unable to save the Jews of Europe from the flames of the Nazis. The limits of the movement's power and ability combined with the weak political position of Jews, and widespread poverty in Europe, is a repeated theme that shows just how high the climb was, facing off against not one, but multiple political powerhouses, including the imperial might of the Ottomans, British, Tzarist Russians, and the new political power centers in the US and USSR. While the concurrent story of the various internal push and shove of the movement's leaders and various factions and wings, was interesting, despite the details, seemed to be almost an aside to the actions and motivations of its leaders (first Herzl, then Weizman). Labor Zionism, Revisionism, the rise of American Jews, all seemed like a background story to the central theme of action and limits of the leaders."}, {"userName": "Namrirru", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188169-namrirru", "userReview": "A must read for anyone interested in Middle Eastern politics.

As someone who is both 2nd and 3rd generation, this country is my home, although I have had a status of partial outsider for most of my time here. There is nowhere else to go, but because of how I look, most of the older generation (at least) will always see me as not quite belonging). So yeah, the desire for having a place of their own led Jews who were historically home-but-outsiders to want the same thing.Yet disgustingly, anything you can imagine saying about Zionism has been said before. Not only by its critics but also by its supporters. Pick any dimension of justification: biological, social, cultural, religious, economic, philosophical, utopic -- and it's been done. What makes this sick is that despite good intentions, what was done to Jews by a diaspora of history is being done by them to others who were there before. And yet, the desire for a home place is strong enough, and carries with it the need that really drives this to happen.I'm not that familiar with the events in this book. So I'm not one to assess the veracity of their occurrence. I will say that Laqueur does try to do a thorough job. He admits to being partial; how can you not be, in such a hotly contested topic? It's significant that Israel might not have happened, not just because of the death of millions and millions of Jews in WW2 but also due to timing. If they waited a year later, it might not have happened. It's sad that so many people had to suffer so that a few can feel like they even have a home.Should current events play out, the children of the immigrants from the Middle East into Europe may one day return to the Middle East with the same intentions. It may be a new Kurdistian, or it may be some other group, but it will happen. The irrationality of nationalism is too strong; it unifies small groups while it divides the human race. The only way for us to coexist is to acknowledge the past, accept that it happened, and then build a future that is appropriate to present conditions -- not appropriate to past conditions. History is too long for us to appease everyone. Land that belonged to one group may have belonged to many many other groups, many of whom hated each other at some point in time."}, {"userName": "John Devlin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34033-john-devlin", "userReview": "Excellent at covering the social and intellectual strains that developed Zionism. From Mendlesohn to Herzl, Weizmann, and Jabotinsky, Laqueur does a strong job of detailing the personalities and the infighting that enveloped so much of the Zionist Movement.Two points stand out. Without Anti-semitism in the form of pogroms throughout early European history there is no wanderlust for a Jewish state and without the Holocaust Israel doesn't happen.Internally, Israel's beginning is a lottery win. Only after such a tragedy with two superpowers momentarily balanced and after a century of indifference by Jews themselves could this singular event be achieved.\"God writes straight with crooked sticks\" And as one famous Jew proved \"Spacetime itself is curved.\""}, {"userName": "Alex Goldstein", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6115086-alex-goldstein", "userReview": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430. \u041a \u0441\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e, \u0432 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f - \u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0439, \u0441\u044a\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043e\u0432, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439, \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c, \u043c\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439. \u0420\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u041f\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u0443\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u044c, \u0444\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c. \u041a\u0430\u043a \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0430.\u0417\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0444\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439, \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0438\u0445, \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044b - \u0423\u0441\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d, \u0427\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0421\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043d, \u041d\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0430\u0443 \u0438 \u0442.\u0434. \u0438 \u0442.\u043f. - \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043a \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430."}, {"userName": "Spencer Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32191091-spencer-wilson", "userReview": "A great account of the Zionist movement from start to finish.
