In this book, David has a conflict internally and externally. The internal conflict is how he feels sad and worthless after all those early years of abuse. The external conflict is between David and his mother. When David was about seven to nine, he excessively abused by his mother. Therefore, with the frequent visits she pays him at his different foster homes, she acts as though he is still worthless and \u2018no better than white trash\u2019.On a scale of one to ten (ten being very good) I would give this book a nine out of ten. This is because it was very sad, but written very well. The first book in this series, A Child Called \u2018It\u2019, David is about seven years old when his mother starts to beat him very much. She would starve him for days, clean the bathrooms with toxic fumes in the air, and she even stabbed him in the stomach once. I personally think that the first book was sadder than the second. I would definitely recommend these books to everyone. However, they are very sad and upsetting. I think everyone of all ages would enjoy these books very much."}, {"userName": "\u0642\u0635\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0629", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4327540", "userReview": "\u0639\u0646\u062f\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0645\u062f\u0629 \u0637\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0639\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0647\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0648 \u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0628\u0647 \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0628\u0648\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0646 \u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0645\u062a\u0634\u0631\u062f \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0646\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0627 \u0625\u0646 \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0648\u0644\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0637\u0639 \u062a\u0631\u0643\u0647! \u0641\u0647\u0648 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0645\u0623\u0633\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628\u061f \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0639 \u0643\u0628\u0631 \u0648\u0623\u0635\u0628\u062d \u0647\u0648 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0627\u064b \u062a\u0631\u0628\u0648\u064a\u0627\u064b\u0648\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u062f\u0631\u064a \u0645\u062a\u0649 \u0647\u0644 \u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0638\u0627\u062a \u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0637\u0641\u0648\u0644\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0646\u062a\u0647\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0642\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u0643\u0631\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0628\u0639\u062f\u0647 \u0644\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627\u062b \u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0628\u062a\u0641\u0635\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u062a\u0639\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0643\u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u062f\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0641\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0638\u0627\u062a \u0641\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0623\u0628\u0639\u062f! .... \u0639\u062c\u064a\u0628\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0644\u0627 \u0623\u062d\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0644\u0636\u0639\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0642\u0644 \u0648\u0636\u064a\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0635 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u0646\u062f\u0631 \u0648\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627\u060c \u062d\u064a\u062b \u062c\u0627\u0621\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u062c\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u062c\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u062e\u0644 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0646\u0649 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0637\u0641\u0629\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639 \u0641\u0625\u0646\u0643 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0635\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u062a\u062a\u0646\u0642\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u062c\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0629 \u0648\u0643\u0623\u0646\u0643 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0647"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/350937-katie", "userReview": "\"The Lost Boy\" is the sequel to \"A Child Called It,\" and it continues where the first memoir left off.

This second part of the trilogy, however, tells you about a boy who's trying to become a man in order to fit in to the society that's all new to him.After being rescued from his mother's abusive claws, Dave was jumping from one foster house to another. Little did he know that the \"likes\" of him. The \"F-kids\" as what they were branded were being looked down by the society. Community saw them as rotten tomatoes, even freak of natures. Like being a foster kid was their fault and choice.Physical abuse seemed more easier to conquer and hurdle than the battle that boiled inside this little man. His questions about his past had led him to slightly crooked paths. More than anything, he wanted to feel like a normal teenager. He wanted to be treated like a human being. These wants eventually became needs. He needed acceptance. He needed to fit in. He needed to feel human. He needed respect. He befriended kids who had given him the merest of attention. Acceptance and recognition came in the form of stealing and lying.Deep inside, he knew he was doing something wrong but his early mind shrugged it off. He was elated. No matter how temporary the feeling was.Foster parents, just like them, were also being frowned upon. But it was from and with these people that David later on realized his worth and found his identity. People who gave him the kind of love his biological parents weren't able to give.-- This book made me cry my eyes out. My eyes were so swollen I didn't dare to go out of the room so that nobody would ask what was wrong. It made me cry not because I felt sorry for the boy that David was or used to. I cried because I admired his courage and strength to make a difference. In some ways, he was the same little kid that stutters every time people talk to him. But he felt the need to become a man or make a man out of himself. And above all these, I especially admired his gift of love. He loved the mother who stabbed him and burned his arm on the stove. He loved the brothers who hated him for revealing \"their secret\". And he loved the father that never stood and fight for him. He loved them more than he loved himself.And for that, He can't be the Lost Boy =)Good Read! :-)"}, {"userName": "Kellie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/842772-kellie", "userReview": "A truly amazing story of Dave Pelzer, the little boy who was viciously abused by his mother. Again, I can\u2019t come close to understanding the viciousness of this woman and how she could treat her own son this way. It is truly amazing that Dave survived and became successful as he did. Dave is so right about Foster Care and the System. I met a woman at work who became a Foster Parent and I truly looked at her in a different light. It takes an extraordinary person to commit themselves to something like that. I really admired her. This book brought tears to my eyes.

I think the moral of the story is to understand, care and love children more. David is a perfect example of a child craving for attention. Any child if not given the proper attention and guidance, even the most angelic and the nicest child in the world, can do things that may hurt others, destroy some property or worst destroy his own future- unintentionally. The story makes you cry without you knowing it. That's how good the book is in playing with your emotion. It opens the mind of the reader to the realities of: the emotional battle of a foster child, the difficulties of foster parents, the hard work and dedication of social workers, the role of a teacher in every child's life, and most especially the \"no one can define your future except yourself\" also \"your past can make you stronger only if you use it wisely.\"Great book :)"}, {"userName": "Lorraine Southern", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51182405-lorraine-southern", "userReview": "17/85, 5 stars *****This book made me cry. One of the most heartbreaking things about this time period for the author (ages 12-18) is that all he still wanted, despite everything his mother had done to him, was her love and to know why she treated him the way she did. Ultimately, he manages to forgive both her for her abuse and his father for his neglect and I find it all so amazing. This author is truly inspirational. By telling his story, he teaches resilience and forgiveness and shows how the human spirit can succeed in the face of the worst kind of adversity. What he went on to do with his life is quite simply phenomenal! I'll say it again - he is truly inspirational."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59409116-emily", "userReview": "\"The lost boy\" is a sequel to, \"A Child Called It,\" and it continues where the first memoir left off.

"userReview": "Reading Response #16I fell in love with this book. It was amazing. This book is a sequel to the first book called 'The Child Called It'. Some kids, teens or adults are afraid to talk about their abusive childhood past. The author does an autobiography about his past, how his mother made him drink washing detergent and make him vomit food. I cannot even imagine that this could even happen. Pelzer's father never bothered to help his own son, I cried when I read this book. It shocked me just to read how miserable he was. I take back all I said about my parents, despite how annoying they are, they only 'annoy' you because they love you, and they care about you. Without them, I do not know what to do in life. I would be lost. Pelzer never had anyone for support, until a nearby school helps. I enjoyed this book very much. I would recommend this book to everyone. We should raise more awareness about this issue. So many kids all around the world gets beaten (physical abuse), verbally abuse..etc every day. I wouldn't ever be able to live like this. The author wrote this autobiography as an example of how some kids are treated in this world, they should be fearless and speak now before its too late. Some kids don't tell anyone about their abusive lives because they are scared that their parents or guardians would abuse them more. It kills me to see how innocent they are, and how mean, cruel are the parents. They have a very icy cold heart. I pity on the kids who are abused everyday."}, {"userName": "Izzy Brogaard", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34840328-izzy-brogaard", "userReview": "The book I read is called The Lost Boy. I really like this book. I like in some situations how David, the main character, handled himself. It is a very sad book, and it also tells a lot about a little boy\u2019s family life. This book starts out as David getting yelled at and abused by his mother. David is only nine. His mom calls them \u201cgames\u201d, and to David, the only way to stay alive is to play those \u201cgames\u201d, so his mom won\u2019t hurt him as bad. One day he gets the chance to run away, so he takes it. He gets found by the police and his dad. His dad lies to the police saying that his mother doesn\u2019t beat him. His dad also says that David says that for attention. His dad gets to take him back home, and everything starts all over again. He has a cot in the basement with no blankets. He has to sit there on his hands and not move, otherwise he will play another one of his Mother\u2019s games. He eventually goes to court and put into a foster home. He gets into trouble after being at his first foster home. David gets taken to a facility, since there is nobody to take him in right now. He liked it there, until he got a visit from his father. His dad said that he messed up the family by exploiting their secret about the abuse. Now, she abuses the other boys. He moves from different homes throughout the years. When he turns 18 he gets his G.E.D. David then joins the air force. I think this book would be good for teenagers. They are more mature and would understand the situations in the book better than a ten year old would. I give this book four stars."}, {"userName": "Sophie Narey (Bookreview- aholic)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37868613-sophie-narey-bookreview--aholic", "userReview": "Published: 01/08/1997Author: Dave PelzerRecommended for: fans of true life novelsThis is the sequel to A Child Called It, in this book we read about the next stage in Dave Pelzer's life. It is a truly amazing and inspiring book, it is one that will move you to tears and make you feel for him. He grew up in an abuse household, with no-one to turn to, in the series of books about his life he reveals just how bad his life was when he was growing up and how he managed to make something of his life dispite what his childhood was like. This book truly makes you appreciate what your own life is like and makes you appreciate the people that you have around you. It is very well written and really draws the reader into the book and makes them feel many different emotions, it is truly a emotional rollercoaster but it is a great book for readers who enjoy true life novels."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21223674-kim", "userReview": "good book even though it was sad"}, {"userName":

\u201cThe Lost Boy\u201d, by Dave Pelzer. This book is the sequel to the series of, \u201cA Child Called It\u201d. The author\u2019s purpose of writing this novel was to show that God can give you any struggle in your life; however he will not give you any difficulty that you cannot handle. He has a plan for everybody, and it will all work out in the end. I feel that David tries to tell everyone who is reading the story that you should never give up on something even if it is the littlest things, because you are not the only one going through whatever your struggle may be. You have to put a smile on, even if you are feeling down on the inside. \tThe theme of this book is basically to tell everyone the struggle he went through and to show that you are not alone and you can get through anything. Dave Pelzer was abused at a very young age growing up by his mother. It was harder each day for him and it felt to him like it never got better. If you try and get through the day, it is just one day closer to the ending of your situation or struggle you have going on in your life and I feel that this is the main theme throughout the whole novel. Throughout the whole story, the author tried to stay on the same topic about his life and how he was abused and to tell everyone how to get through things in a better way and stay strong. \tThe style of this novel is narrative because the author is telling a story that happened to him at a young age. The author is trying to inform everybody his struggles he went through as a child. Dave Pelzer had it very hard as a young boy and it was defiantly not easy. Abuse is something that happens all over the world today. It is very cruel and unfair. Unfortunately, we live in a world where no matter what people do, it will never stop. Many children, teenagers and even adults have abuse in their life or have had it at a point in time. No matter whom you are, no human being deserves this and I really hope adults read this novel to see how unfair this is, and no child on Earth deserves it. \tMy opinion on this book, it I thought it was extremely incredible and almost life- changing. When I read this story, and all the events that happened to him, I could feel the emotion through the book. I felt sadness, angriness, and even happiness because he was saved from the terrible events in his life. I liked everything about the book and how Dave wrote it and I would not change a single line in the story. The book that is similar to the sequel, \u201cA Child Called It\u201d. This is the story where he is a child and is going through the pain. I feel that we do not know how lucky we really are. We take things for granted and don\u2019t know how much we really have. It is really sad to think that we have to have something bad happen to us, for us to realize what is sitting right in front of us. This book made me realize how blessed I am to have an amazing and supporting family who loves and cares for me each and every single day. No child should EVER have to go through abuse. Every person deserves a mother and a father that loves them. Everyone on Earth should have somebody who treats them right and should not be treated badly and I love how Dave Pelzer tells that in this story."}, {"userName": "Lindsay Bui", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26494133-lindsay-bui", "userReview": "Dave Pelzer\u2019s The Lost Boy tells the story of his so called childhood, the years of abuse, disappearing with one decision that led to his discovery of a life and a world outside of his home. The book is set in his grade school to high school years, when he transit from being abused at home to living in the foster care system.Wanting to escape his mother\u2019s beatings yet yearning for her love and acceptance, Dave made a difficult decision of leaving his mother. Dave learns to adapt to his new life in the foster care system, a life style that he has chosen. The book reflects on Dave\u2019s childhood, which allows readers to be inspired to not let obstacles in their lives discourage them from doing what they want.Ultimately, the story of Dave Pelzer is a story of a transition from childhood to manhood, adapting to new environments, and discovering one\u2019s self amidst of internal conflicts and conspiracy against a foster child. It all adds up to a tale of acceptance and forgiveness, the true meaning of enlightenment that too many people disregard. The Lost Boy conveys that story emotionally through actual events, attempting to help lost souls, much like Dave Pelzer, to discover and be driven to achieve their passion, and to find their standing in society.The most memorable event in the book was when Dave made the decision to leave his mother, despite her threat from her previous visit. Knowing that Dave was scared by his mother, Ms. Gold (Pam) encouraged him to tell the court about his mother and what he wanted. Dave was a brave soul making that decision, because during his stay in the foster care system, he has always feared that his mother would take him back. Dave gave up in wanting to escape his mother\u2019s beatings after her threat, but Pam insist and inspired him to leave his mother. Dave listened to Pam due to their deep connection. He couldn\u2019t stand disappointing her nor reject her feelings. Through this book I was able to learn more about the foster care system. Its significance and affect on the community. This book also reminded me to not take things for granted and appreciate little things in life. This book motivated me to work hard to reach my goal because by the end of the day whatever you\u2019re doing is for you and your own benefit in its own form. This book truly touches my heart because I love children and I can\u2019t stand the idea of them being abuse or neglected. Children symbolize innocence, but Dave Pelzer was forced to think about life in views beyond his comprehension. I felt as if I was Dave as he questioned life and desperately trying to find himself through his issues.I would recommend this book because it was an inspiring story and it surely is a reality check. Often times when people want to make a change they would think about helping third world countries. They fail to realize that people in their own community also need help and support. If you ever feel like the world is conspiring against you or need a little motivation then read this book. It will remind you that there will always be the less fortunate and how hard it takes for them to overcome their situations."}, {"userName": "Brit McCarthy", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4181396-brit-mccarthy", "userReview": "The second book in the Dave Pelzer trilogy is The Lost Boy, chronicling Dave\u2019s life in foster homes from the age of twelve to eighteen. Again I have come to the end and feel immediately like I have to put a few other books in between this and the next and final book, A Man Named Dave. I don\u2019t feel like another book is necessary but have decided to read it for the sake of completeness.At the start of the book, Dave insists this one is written using the language and perspective he had at that age. He also insisted the same thing in the last book. This is not a completely accurate description as many times I felt the writing to be reflective and also some of it beyond the years of the under-educated teenager he was at the time. We catch up with Dave where we left him in the last book, in the passenger seat of a police car heading outside the city limits, where after medical examinations he meets his social worker and is placed in the first of five foster homes.Living in a foster home is very different from where Dave has come from and throughout the years that follow he struggles to find his place in the homes and in school. He has a stint or two in a juvenile detention hall and is passed around a bit until he settles down and decides where he wants to go in life.More than anything I found this book to be a testament to the hard work of social workers and foster parents. Their job is far from easy and yet they strive to remove child from abusive homes and place them suitably, and provide them with the help they need. The part of the book I found most worth reading was after the Epilogue, the section entitled Perspectives on Foster Care which contained statements from Dave\u2019s foster mother, a juvenile detention worker and a teacher. I found this to be an eye-opening view on the foster system and I appreciate the acknowledgement of foster carers and other authors of works on being a child in the foster system. If this content could be expanded further it would make for a great read on the work of foster carers and an insight to the foster system. Just maybe leave Dave Pelzer out. He\u2019s got plenty of books under his belt already and we all know his perspective.As for the content itself, I enjoyed reading this book more than I did A Child Called \u2018It\u2019. But considering it is supposed to be an autobiographical memoir, some of the recollections from his life as described in the first book had facts that didn\u2019t match up, which makes you question the credibility of the \u2018memoir\u2019. It could simply be due to the passage of time, he was only a child so of course he\u2019s not going to remember everything and things get mixed up. I would have hoped that the editor would fix this up but clearly it wasn\u2019t noticed or was ignored. These kind of things can be infuriating for a reader like me.A slight improvement. 2.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Katie Siehr", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6370831-katie-siehr", "userReview": "I read the book \"The Lost Boy\", which is a sequel to the book, \"A Child Called It\" it was about a man named Dave Pelzer's, and life as a foster child. \"The Lost Boy\" is an autobiography. In this book I read about how Dave had changed over the years of being a foster child because of the things he had gone through. David Pelzer's life as a kid wasn't exactly perfect. He was abused by his parents for most of his life. His mother wasn't nice to him and his father was an alcoholic. His mother would make him throw up his food that she found out he had stolen or that someone had given to him. She would make him sleep in a cold garage with no blanket, and work very hard all day every day except for when he went to school. Dave ran away from home when he was nine, and a concerned person had called the police. The police came and took him to a hospital and they cleaned him up. A social worker was called and Davis was taken to court to fight against his parents (mostly his mom. He won against his mom and was taken to foster home after foster home. The foster homes weren't easy for David. He had to get used to a new home,new family, new school, and new neighborhood every few months. David didn't fit in with other kids because he was a foster child and he didn't make friends easily. I think David was very courageous to face his mother and for just being a foster child. David learned over the years to keep his head up and stay strong. He talks about loving life and being happy for who you are, no matter what. Even if you don't like who you are at that point in time, you can always change it, but the one thing you can't change is who your parents are. When David got older he enlisted in the Air Force because he was very interested in flying. He said that if you believe in yourself, you can do anything. This book helped me understand the hardships of being a foster child and the struggles of David Pelzer's life. I had read his first book \"A Child Called It\" last year and I always thought that he lived a good loved life after winning against his mom, and the I read this book read \"The Lost Boy\" and I couldn't help but feel sorry for David and how he still was pretty much neglected still even after winning against his mother, but he still had no one. No one to talk to about what he had been through or friends to play with and a family who loved him, thats just rough especially coming from the background he came from. Read \"The Lost Boy\" to find out more about Dave and his life.I think the authors point of view was to share his story to the world to let other people know that if they are being abused that it is ok to tell someone because they can help you get away from the people who are harming you."}, {"userName": "Krystal Chihuahua", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30393211-krystal-chihuahua", "userReview": "I recommend this book because it has a very detailed description about a very young boys life named David. Lives in a physical and verbal abuse home with an alcoholic mother that has so much hate towards her son David. His mother doesn't give him the \"identity\" of a child. Just imagine 7 year old getting hit and beaten everyday without any cry out for help. Terrified of everything and anything that surrounds him. His only possession that he can call his own is his torn up clothes that he has in a paper bag. His mother treats him like an animal more specifically, like a dog. Lives in fear that if he leaves his home that his mother will look for him and torture him again like she always does. Although he gets rescued from this horrible alcoholic mother and is sent to foster care, his pain and suffering and living in fear everyday and night is just the beginning for David. The theme of this novel would have to be self discovery for young David. Why self discovery? Well, Davis is finding and figuring out who he is and is battling to overcome the suffering of his mothers abuse. He wants to feel \"free\" and feel the love with somebody cares deeply for him and will defend him whenever he needs it. Even though he wants to please his mother in staying home he knows what has happened is best for him to discover who he really is. What I mean by self discovery I mean is that David the main character in this book was isolated with suffering and never felt how it really is to have a \"normal life\". So now that he is away from all these things, he is feeling how it really is to be a kid and looking for the answers he always wondered about his family. That is the theme of this novel, self discovery. Symbolism takes a really big part of this book. The descriptiveness within the words that give you the clear image of how David feels is incredible. I cant say I cant relate to this but I sure know how David felt living with his alcoholic mother and family that did nothing but hurt him mentally and physically. If I would have to convince or persuade someone to read this book I would say that its incredible book never boring and keeps you guessing. I was not disappointed reading it and from the people that I know including my family members they read this book.

It is a sad story based around his physical and mental abuse that he receives from his mother. David is eventually placed into multiple foster homes, seeking for the safety and love from others. An important theme in this story tells us about the importance of staying strong and never giving up.David received the strength to run away from home knowing it was his last chance of survival. What hurt him the most was the thought of losing his father, his hero, through the events that were about to take course. This young boy was placed into a bulk of foster homes and kept his head up through every change he encountered. David went through both rough and smooth patches because of the choices he had made, but eventually gains the confidence and strength necessary to overcome them all.This is my favorite book and I highly recommend any age group to read it. It provides you with vivid details, making you feel as if you were experiencing these hardships with David. This book is written extremely well and is also very easy to follow along with. What stood out the most to me in this story was the fact that this young boy acquired the strength to never give up through every encounter he was challenged with and was heading towards a successful future. David is so inspirational to me and makes me personally rethink my hardships.With every rough spot that I go through I am reminded that they could always be worse, and to be thankful that I do not have to go through the abuse and challenges that David did.It is remarkable that this man wrote these books himself and is willing to share his story. This book would be a good example to younger children to not bully and be more aware that their peers could be hurting. This may also send a positive message out to those who are taking part in an abusive relationship, showing them that it is ok to seek help and that they are in for a brighter and healthier future. This is a perfect example of staying strong, never giving up through difficult life experiences, and that nothing is too hard to overcome."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15676694-connie", "userReview": "This is a continuation of the series from the book A Child Called It. This takes place after Mr. Pelzer is removed from his home and into foster care at the age of 12. The book starts off with a heart wrenching scene of the gross mistreatment to him by his mother. I couldn't even get through the first chapter without practically crying on the outside and screaming on the inside, \"Why did this happen to him?\" Throughout the book I wanted to know why his mother was such a monster and why did she single out Dave? A person would think that once a child is put into foster care that they would be safe from the one who tried to harm them, I found out that this is not always the case especially in the mid to late 70's. Even after being removed from the home, his mother tried to mentally abuse him by visiting him and letting him know that she would be watching him and if he messed up she would make sure that he would pay for his transgressions. The foster care system is a place of refuge for Dave and the families that he is placed with are kinder to him than his real parents. He had his issues and acted out on them because of the confusion he had on the inside, but he wasn't necessarily as bad or dangerous of a kid as he could have been due to the circumstances of his life. He was aggressive, but only to those who sought to harm him. He stole, in order to be accepted by others. He retreated into himself when he was in public forums because people treated him as an outsider. He hung out with the wrong crowd, but during all that time he never lost himself to the madness because he always knew what was right and eventually got himself back on track with the help of the foster parents around him. It was a good story, but being told from the child's POV continually left questions that were never answered because the details may or may not have been discussed with Dave, or it could be that children remember what they want to remember so some details are lost in the shuffle. The book goes from Dave being placed in foster care up until the time he phased out and entered the Air Force."}, {"userName": "Cam Rogers", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13932849-cam-rogers", "userReview": "The Lost Boy by Dave PelzerRating: 7Review:In his sequel to the haunting and devastating A Child Called \u201cIt\u201d, Dave Pelzer takes us through the journey of his removal from his mother\u2019s cruel home and into the world of a foster child.

He tries to find his strengthens and weaknesses to balance out his daily routine. The boy is telling the story, which is easier for him to express how he feels. The theme of The Lost Boy is to fight your way through life\u2019s struggles because struggles make you stronger. In the beginning of the book, the struggle begins like this, \u201cI\u2019m alone. I\u2019m hungry and I\u2019m shivering in the dark\u2026My neck and shoulder muscles begin to throb. But that\u2019s nothing new I\u2019ve learned to turn off the pain. I\u2019m Mother\u2019s prisoner.\u201d The first paragraph in the book shows that he is already struggling and needs help.The style the book was written in is narration. Narration is the telling of a story through a series of events that describes what happened, usually in chronological order. In The Lost Boy, most of the chapters would start out as a date or where the chapter was taking place. The book walks you through the boy\u2019s life, starting at age 9 until he was 18. It clearly shows the boy\u2019s journey through the foster families.This book was enjoyable and easy to read. I liked the book because it gave me a glimpse of another person\u2019s life, but I disliked the abuse suffered by the boy. I would give this book 5 out of 5. The book made me realize how lucky I am to have a loving family and safe home."}, {"userName": "Joanna Cabot", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3100263-joanna-cabot", "userReview": "Begun this with hesitation after not being terribly impressed by the first book in this memoir trilogy, but since it was a library book and it was fairly short, I was curious to see how Pelzer's story continued. There were many issues left unresolved after the first book, and this one addressed many of them and was a vast improvement. Pelzer's style does tend to the melodrama (lots of exclamation points and declarations that a moment was a turning point in his future) but I respect what he has overcome and I found the book to be an engaging and moving story.One perspective I especially appreciated was Mr. Pelzer's abiding respect for the social workers, foster parents and other caring adults in his life. Many other books I have read on this subject portray these people as inept, uncaring or outright abusive. It was nice to see a memoir about foster care where the writer acknowledges that adults did help him, and in the end, he gives one set of parents the ultimate tribute of calling them mom and dad.I suppose you do need to read the first book, gory and clunky though it was, to appreciate this one. But, having done so, I found volume 2 in Pelzer's memoir series to be a vast improvement and a good read."}, {"userName": "Cordavia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4842816-cordavia", "userReview": "To me this book was sad because i couldnt believe that a mother would treat her own flesh and blood like an animal.I couldnt believe that a mother would hurt her child the way david pelzer mother hurt him for so many years.I feel that this book is a good way to get children that are going through some of the things that david go through out of this situation.This book an so many ways could be helpful because at the very end of the book theres like an phone book of numbers that can be of some help to abused children or adults.I was very EAGER about him moving out cause it was a start to a new beginging in his life.I like the way Mrs.gold PERSERVED him made me very happy.To all mothers around the world if your going to PENALIZE your child dont get drunk and try to kill them,dont beat them to where there little bones feel like there broke.A mother to a mother no child deserve to be beating.I rated this book a five because it can be helpful in so many ways.I have a question for parents all around the world if you have ever beating your child to the point where they can't move how do you live with yourself knowing that your child is n great pain?"}, {"userName": "Dee Toomey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/245357-dee-toomey", "userReview": "To say that David Pelzer came from \"a dysfunctinal home\" would be like saying the Jews were \"treated badly\" during the holacaust! How he literally survived is a puzzle, but how he survived to go one to live a \"normal\" life is a miracle. We all have baggage, but this man carries a whole set of luggage!This story picks up where \"A Child Called It\" left off. At 12 years old, he finally escapes the hell he lived in as a child. Yet, as an adolescent, foster-home juggling can bring trials and troubles all their own. It would have been wonderful for Dave to have been placed with one family until he became 18, but that wasn't a break that was afforded him. Still this young man perserveres.I am going to read his next book, \"A Man Named Dave\". Not to see how his story ends as we can't know that until it actually \"end\", but to \"check up on\" him...to see if he is doing okay so far. You grow to love the boy and care for his well-being...and you pray for his continued healing from his past of unthinkable existence."}], "description": "\"The Lost Boy\" is the harrowing but ultimately uplifting true story of a boy's journey through the foster-care system in search of a family to love.
