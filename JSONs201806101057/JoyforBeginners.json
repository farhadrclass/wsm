I don't know how she manages to do it. Every word is perfect, every description tangible, every moment striking. There are many books I have given 5 stars too - usually because the story is fun or enjoyable, not necessarily because the writing itself is so incredible. I loved Bauermeister's first book and am equally enthralled with her second.Now that's not to say that this book is easy. Far from it, for me anyway. The author explores all manner of loss and betrayal and sadness. I don't like sad books but these I can handle because the sadness is always tempered with love, friendship, joy, and hope. You aren't left feeling desolate, and it's not that every story has a happy ending either, but the reality of life continuing on and that one can get through is always present. Just like in School of Essential Ingredients, the book is broken into sections by character, with each section its own miniature novel. Bauermeister's writing always leaves me with the desire to hold my husband and children, wanting to cherish them against the inevitability of life.Bauermeister's writing is fluid and effortless, her descriptions magical. It might not be the kind of book everyone would enjoy but I would recommend it for its sheer excellence. It's a book that leaves me breathless and wishing I could write like Bauermeister, knowing I never could, and yet not saddened by that thought at all."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "A few years ago, a new phrase burst into our vernacular: the bucket list, based on a movie in which two men confront their limitations and prepare a list of things they must do. The list is predictably exotic: skydiving, flying over the North Pole, eating dinner at Chevre d\u2019Or in France.In Joy for Beginners, it\u2019s the women\u2019s turn to enact that list. On an uncharacteristically sunny day in Seattle, six women assemble to celebrate their friend Kate\u2019s clean bill of health from breast cancer. Unbeknownst to them, right before arrival, Kate\u2019s daughter had suggested an exhilarating white water rafting trip down the Grand Canyon. Her friends urge her on and she agrees to go on one condition: that she gets to choose a challenge for each of her friends to overcome.Unlike an adventurous male version, the challenges are far more targeted and subtle. For example, the recently divorced book store owner, Caroline, is asked to sort through her ex-husband\u2019s library and dispose of all the books he left behind, clearing the decks (or the shelves!) for a new life. Daria, a gifted but restless potter, is directed to mold loaves of bread as a way of getting past emotional damage done by a hypercritical mother. Another friend, Ava, who was most reluctant to visit Kate at the hospital, as a result of flashbacks to her own mother\u2019s battle with cancer, is asked to do the sixty mile breast cancer fundraising walk. And so on.If this sounds a little formulaic, it\u2019s because it is. Each woman, in turn, must confront her deepest fears and ask herself: what is holding me back? What am I most afraid of? What obstacle must I overcome to grow and thrive? What does it truly mean to be alive? As each discovers, hidden terrors need not be physically demanding ones, such as whitewater rafting. Often the little things that seem simple on the surface (making bread, tackling an overgrown garden, getting a tattoo) are indicative of more daunting issues.Each chapter comes with its own back story; we get to meet each friend, one by one, learn the task that she has been assigned by Kate, and see how she is capable of accomplishing that task \u2013 whether it\u2019s connecting with the right man, gaining a degree of added independence, or delving into herself to face her fears. Unlike real life, there is resolution for each and every woman. By the time Kate takes her own journey down the river \u2013 a metaphor, of course, for life \u2013 she is able to recognize her own cathartic role in the lives of her friends. \u201cShe had been a river, Kate thought, the thing that took them close to death made them suddenly, courageously, honest.\u201dJoy for Beginners is a book for a select audience, primarily women who enjoy inspirational tales about how the power of sisterhood can help transform lives. Its message is a powerful one: by taking risks and opening up to joy, one can surmount any personal obstacle including dealing with divorce, accepting a mother\u2019s failings, embracing independence, acknowledging hidden talents, and choosing to live with confidence. At the end, it\u2019s likely that each woman will question, \u201cWhat is the one thing in life that I need to deal with to live more fully?\u201d And that, of course, is the point."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6473739-kristen", "userReview": "Normally I would never rate a book in the \"chick lit\" genre more than 4 stars. But, this book made me do something I've never before done; I re read it the same week I finished it. I felt like the characters were calling me back to get to know them better. And, when I read about the six women again, I realized that they all had something to tell me. Each chapter is about one of six friends who are in a pact to complete a personal challenge. Caroline is recovering from a husband who traded her in for someone who is, \"...all round curves and glossy surfaces.\" Daria has been carrying around a mother's disapproval for her entire life. Sara has been drowning in the joyful, but consuming, role of motherhood and has lost her identity. Hadley is a widow who has let her life strangle her. Marion is an empty nester and going through menopause. Ava lost her mother to cancer when she was 10 and still needs closure. And, Kate is the cancer survivor who is afraid to go rafting down the Grand Canyon.As each of theses women faces the challenge that their friend,Kate, dreamed up for them, I realized that what they each really needed was some purging and creating. Purge old garbage and create new space. For instance, Carolyn had always \"...loved the idea of filling the shelves of her life with the roles of daughter, friend, girlfriend, wife, mother...\" her friend, Marion, says to her, \"I'm just thinking ... that it might be nice to figure out how  you want to live.\" Then, as Carolyn gets rid of her ex's things she, \"...realized with a sense of small quiet surprise that roles in her well stocked bookshelf of life were leaving, had left, one by one as they had come.\"This book just happens to speak to me right where I am at as a 48 year old woman with college aged kids. I also particularly liked Carolyn's character and her discussion about the word \"marriage\" and the idea that it can be a noun - something that can be shed like a coat or put on a shelf, or, it can be used as a verb - as in an action word; the act of being entwined."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5085530-kristen", "userReview": "When I first read the synopsis of this book, it sounded like something I would really enjoy. I liked the premise, the thought of character development and growth; however, I found little of that in this book. I kept on trying to like this book, but it just didn't work for me. I think that Erica Bauermeister had a really good plot idea, but the book was too short for it to ever develop. Seven women's stories are told in this book, each getting their own chapter to highlight their adventure that Kate chose for them. Each woman had the possibility of a unique story, but they never grew. You got a little back story on each woman, her task, and then her completion of the task. Every woman's task tied up nicely, with them finding a man/gaining insight/overcoming a fear. It was too formulaic and predictable.My other problem with this book was the writing. I felt that the writing wasn't organic, that Bauermeister was trying too hard to express the character's feelings. It was too decadent at times, the words and language trying to convey too much. Also, the chapters were a bit too choppy for my liking. Some paragraphs were only three or four sentences, and then break away to a new thought. It wasn't something I really ever connected to because the writing was too distracting for me. I really wanted to enjoy this book, and while the premise of the book still appeals to me, it's not something that I will be reading again."}, {"userName": "MaryG2E", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20933650-maryg2e", "userReview": "I greatly enjoyed this charming book about a group of Seattle-based women whose lives intertwine. Aged from about 35 to 55, the women are connected as relatives, friends, neighbours or colleagues. Generally speaking they can be relied on to be there for each other when things get tough. Most recently they have been there for Kate, supporting her as she underwent surgery and chemotherapy in a grim battle against breast cancer. At a dinner party to celebrate Kate's remission, they are all given a challenge by her, to do something different and find new things in their lives. Kate issued the challenges because she saw the need for each of them to find new ways of being happy and receiving joy into their hearts.For example, Sara is a stay-at-home mother, who's determined to be Super-Mom. She and her husband are raising three children, including toddler-aged twins, and her hands are always full. She puts her own needs right at the bottom of every To-Do list. So Kate's challenge to Sara was to take a trip away by herself. Ava is a highly successful businesswoman, a perfumier living in LA, and her challenge was to reconnect with her childhood haunts, and rediscover the joys of Home.Above all the book is about finding pleasure through re-connecting with the senses. Widowed at an early age, Hadley finds her self-imposed austerity is broken down thanks to Kate's challenge when she discovers a passion for gardening, with its abundance of colours and scents. Daria, a professional potter, is connected to the earth through the feel of clay, but she discovers a whole new field of sensory delights as she learns to bake bread. And through those new sensations, the women heal or make peace with their pasts, or set new directions, all designed to enhance their lives.Bauermeister's pleasant prose makes for easy reading. The tone is definitely positive throughout. Although there are some grim moments, the story is intended to be uplifting, which is how I experienced it. **Checking on the internet just now, it seems this book may have been published at some time with a different title: A Year of the Unexpected. I don't understand this change, but it presumably is due to different markets. The author's website calls the book Joy for Beginners."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/718537-adam", "userReview": "Post Listen Review: Can I give this one negative stars? I complain a lot about the romance books I have to hear to listen to all the audiobooks in the library but at least those don't take themselves as seriously as this one does. It is called Joy for Beginners but it gave me pretty much the opposite emotion. People in my generation tend to get a lot of flack for being self absorbed but I have to tell you that we have nothing on these women in this book. I will give a short plot summary and point out some of the parts in which I can back up my claim. So the plot is pretty simple. A woman has survived breast cancer and has a dinner party to celebrate. Her daughter has given her a challenge to go white water rafting in the Grand Canyon which the woman is at least somewhat afraid of doing. The other women at the party think it is a great idea and that the cancer survivor should do it. She agrees but only if she can give each of the other women some kind of a challenge too. Sounds ok enough but there are some issues here.I knew that I wouldn't like this book right away because someone brings a wooden salad bowl to a house party. If I have a house party, bring some burgers or cookies or something and leave the salad at home. Especially if I have just survived cancer and can now eat whatever I want again. (Apologies to anyone who is a huge fan of wooden salad bowls) But ok that is sort of a minor thing. The woman has this party and she wants to call it a get together or something like that to which one of the women responds, \"Let us call it a victory party. You wouldn't want to spoil our fun now would you?\" Um let me think... did you survive cancer? No? Then let me call my party whatever the hell I want to.Then because this woman has survived cancer she is supposed to have some kind of insight into the soul or whatever so she will choose exactly the right challenges so that the women will be \"complete\" or whatever. How self absorbed is she to think she should mess around with all her friends lives?The challenges are mostly dumb. The first one is for this lady to clean out all her ex-husband's books so she can get on with her life I guess. She does it and then her friend goes, \"You know what's going to be hard? The beach house.\" To which I want to say, shut up you have a beach house, life is not that bad. And she keeps thinking back to how her husband didn't used to be about money but now all his books are about selling stuff. How do you think you got the beach house???The reason this woman's husband left her was cause he cheated on her but she turns to her friend at the beach house and asks her why she thought people broke up. The friend says that \"love is like those waves. You have to wait for it to hit you over and over. People just forget to wait.\" That is not what love is like at all. Love feels (at least to me) like a fact. I don't sit around waiting for a wave of love to hit me as I look at my wife, it's already there and always will be. I know I love my son, not a question of waves. That was a horribly bad metaphor.Then there was a challenge to clean up a garden. They say in there somewhere you can tell more about a person from their garden than from any other way or something. Hello what??? Not everyone I know has a garden. In fact most people I know don't have gardens. And here is what you can tell about me from my being in a garden. I need an anti-histamine stat. There is a challenge about making bread. What that really should have been called was date this guy who is a baker and will help you get over your mother issues.A semi-reasonable challenge was to get a tattoo. I don't really remember what happened there cause I tuned out of that story mostly. She got the tattoo though.Another challenge was traveling. That one should have been called, go to a foreign country, get kissed by some random guy and then you will realize you are more than just a mom. I didn't notice her telling her husband about getting kissed though. A bit unfair since the guy was all for her going.The three day walk challenge seemed like the only one that fit cause the woman's sister never saw her when she was sick so she had to do the three day walk. But the sister asks her if she was given that challenge to punish her. The cancer survivor says no and then the sister says, then you are not angry with me? And she says, I didn't say that. So to me that means that she was punishing her. Not that she didn't deserve it. But be honest.And finally the woman who survived cancer went white water rafting.She gets angry and upset at one point and all her emotions come out but then she feels that the water \"must be coming out of her\" as it rushes along. That is the most self absorbed thing I ever heard. You think you are a river? The river does not care about you. It will gladly kill you or leave you alone, the water does not come from you. Sorry you had cancer and you have every right to be angry but you are not a freaking river!To sum up, I am not in favor of anyone having cancer but just because you have had it doesn't mean you know everything. And if you can afford beach houses and gardens and foreign travel and whatnot, you are probably not as bad off as you think you are in the first place. I am so looking forward to the next book where someone gets murdered. It will bring me a lot more Joy I am sure.Pre-listen Guess: I wanted to sign up for advanced mirth but apparently this book is a prerequisite."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/454028-kate", "userReview": "I must preface my remarks by saying that I read this book AFTER having just finished Les Miserables, Jesus Land and Love and Other Demons. So, it can't really hold a candle to ANY of those really wonderful works of literature. This does get FIVE stars for being the chickiest chick lit I have ever laid eyes on. It's about seven women living very conventional woman-y lives--all in or just out of relationships, or suffering from woman diseases (breast cancer), or doing woman-y things. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it was just OVER THE TOP conventional girl stuff. Each woman was assigned a challenge to complete by the woman with the breast cancer, everything from learning to bake bread to getting a tattoo to shooting the rapids in the Colorado River to doing a breast cancer walk. Big deal. And supposedly they learned \"deep life lessons\" as they did their little adventure. Blah, blah, blah. LOTS of navel-gazing back story. Sort of like the author made up a bunch of character studies for various fiction classes and stuck them all in the same book. Mildly interesting sometimes. I didn't hate it so passionately that it sinks to the level of a one-star or zero-star horrid book, but neither would I recommend it."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3527423-debbie", "userReview": "A group of friends amassed over the years by circumstance with as much diversity as similarities jump over one more hurdle in life. The conquering of Breast Cancer is no small feat and the journey not solitary, so on the night of her victory dinner Kate gives each of the friends that brought her to this destination the gift of a challenge. Each challenge is designed especially for it\u2019s recipient, and like many gifts not always appreciated at the time of it\u2019s giving. At the onset these women view completing their challenge only to appease their friend, but in the act of doing, each of them will learn something about themselves that otherwise might have stayed hidden. So while Caroline, Marion, Daria, Hadley, Sara and last but not least Ava begin their personal adventure Kate will go on one of her own. Erica Bauermeister might be a new author to me but by the end of the first chapter she was a new acquaintance and by the end of her tale a life long friend. I absolutely loved her storyline and being a woman it became very personal to me and as I read it my view of life and friendship changed and deepened. Her use of beautiful descriptive prose in her narrative made me smile and also increased my enjoyment of the read and I found myself looking intently for the next adventure in the novel and how the author\u2019s creative words would describe it, I was never disappointed. Her characters are made even more special by the mere fact of their everydayness, their next door neighborness and their best friendness and I found myself jealous of their camaraderie and even their anger over their particular challenge at it\u2019s giver. I also found each of the characters portrayed so well that by the end of the novel I was tempted to go out and greet them myself in my own hometown.My challenge to you is to not only read this novel but to revel in the friendship, share in the joy and lend a shoulder in their sorrows, to not be afraid to try something new and maybe just a little frightening, but most of all to be the best friend you can possibly be.If you cherish beautifully written women\u2019s fiction this is a novel that has to be on your must read list.Thank you Ms. Bauermeister for an incredible trip and I plan to take another one with you very soon."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9832902-jean", "userReview": "I didn't find anything joyful about it."}, {"userName": "Susan (aka Just My Op)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489613-susan-aka-just-my-op", "userReview": "(fiction) Joy for Beginners \u2013 what a lovely title. Still, I was afraid as I started reading this book that is was going to be too much women's lit for me, all that touchy-feely stuff, too much about emotions and high drama of the OMG kind.Kate didn't succumb to cancer after all, and her daughter signed both of them for a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon, something Kate really didn't want to do, something she would do to please her daughter; pleasing others is what she did best. At her victory-over-cancer party, Kate decided that she would challenge each of her friends with a task they wouldn't want to do, something emotionally if not physically risky. And after all that Kate had endured, how could they say no?Adults need to have fun so children will want to grow up.I loved this book. Yes, it is about relationships, mostly about the friendships women create with one another, flaws and all. The characters are beautiful souls doing the best they can, sometimes failing, sometimes soaring. The writing is descriptive but not florid \u2013 I could smell the bread and feel the wet clay.A favorite quote, but no background because that would tell too much:It was a little like the Oklahoma land rush, only with better bras.Joy for Beginners is a perfect read for a warm summer day, for reflections on friendships and how they carry us over the bumps in our lives.I was given an uncorrected proof of the book by the publisher, for which I am grateful.

It tells the tale of seven friends who have shared life, child rearing, love, divorce, near death and recovery together. Kate is one of the seven friends and has recently fought a battle with breast cancer. Her friends encourage her to go on a white water rafting trip with her daughter and she agrees - but only if they each agree to do one thing that scares them. They agree and Kate tells them she'll chose their tasks for them.One thing I love about this book is that there is a part of me that wants to do nearly every task these women are given. Do I long to learn to make bread, get a tattoo, rid my life of unnecessary clutter and more? Yes. Am I likely to tackle all (or even one) of these things this year without a cadre of friends cheering me on? No.Joy for Beginners beautifully shows how friendship can be a saving grace in a woman's life and could even be a road map for how to love friends through hard times and tough places.This book isn't deep reading. It's almost what I would classify as chick lit. My chief complaint? I wanted more time with these women. I wanted to know more backstory, more details.

The character, Kate, chooses challenges for each of her friends who had supported her through a bout with cancer. Magically, she manages to choose just the perfect challenge for each friend, even though some of them were secret longings within a friend's own mind. How could she have known these so perfectly?Of course, each challenge resulted in just the right amount of work, introspection, revelations, and empowerment. Too cliche, too perfect, and even the writing bothered me with too many metaphors and similes. It's unusual that supposed \"good writing\" bothers me, but in this book I felt it was way overdone.I gave it three stars because there were parts that kept my attention and interst, such as the rafting ride through the Grand Canyon. That part was interesting and was maybe a zillionth of a microgram less perfect than the other portions. I was leaning toward two stars, but the parts that I found interesting got it up to three.Later: I can't leave it at a 3.

Each of the chapters show one woman dealing with her particular challenge. Though I found the women well portrayed, I found it hard to relate to my experience of Venice to that in this book. Similarly I skipped through the chapter on getting a tattoo fairly quickly, whereas the one where Caroline has to get rid of her ex husband\u2019s books hooked me in completely, even though I\u2019ve never had an ex husband. Sometimes I would have liked to have stayed longer with certain characters rather than be taken off to learn about the next character.

Joy for Beginners tells the story of breast cancer survivor Kate and her six closest friends. At a celebratory dinner party, Kate is pressured to go on a white water rafting trip with her daughter. Kate finally agrees to do so on one condition: each dinner party guest needs to complete a task of Kate's choosing within the year. The tasks are surprising, intimate, and reflective of how well Kate knows each member in her diverse circle of women. I love Bauermeister's sensuous and intelligent prose style. \"Joy for Beginners\" was one of the highlights of my reading year."}, {"userName": "Holli", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/622853-holli", "userReview": "This book sticks with you long after it's done. The author's descriptive voice is perfection and I loved reading each word of this novel. You care about each character and you can identify really well with each of them and the stages of life that they are in at the time. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because even though the novel starts out enmeshing all of the characters and showing how they connect... it then goes on to tell the story of each one of them separately. I feel that each of these characters and their stories could be a novel themselves and so it left me wanting a little more."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill", "userReview": "Generally I\u2019m apt to eschew books about groups of women and their interrelationships. It seems too much of the \u201csame old, same old\u201d to me, and a cheap way to achieve sentimentality. But I did not shrink from reading this book by Bauermeister, because I knew from reading her previous book, The School of Essential Ingredients, that her sensuous prose and eye for the subtle vernacular of relationships would make a rewarding story. Indeed, I not only loved it, I wanted a sequel when I was done!"}, {"userName": "Jo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3787430-jo", "userReview": "Nice!

Ms. Bauermeister made up for that by including some excellent descriptions of the art and process of bread-baking.This novel has another rather simple premise, and is again largely about a set of fully realized, relatable characters. A group of female friends come together at the beginning of the book to celebrate one\u2019s triumph over cancer. This survivor, Kate, has a daughter who wants to bring her on a rafting trip in the Grand Canyon. Kate\u2019s friends urge her to go, to use this as an affirmation of the life that she almost lost. She agrees to take on the challenge if, in return, each of them performs an act requiring similar courage, something they\u2019ve never done or need to do, before she leaves for the trip. The catch is that she gets to choose for each friend, just as they have chosen for her.As she did before, in The School of Essential Ingredients, the author has given every character her own chapter, in which the details of that woman\u2019s past and her present situation are revealed and explained. For me, each woman felt like a friend by the end of her chapter. They all have some sort of dissatisfaction in their lives, whether large or small. Some of them have to learn to cope with tragedy, some need to deal with the aftermath of their own mistakes. By the ends of their respective chapters, all of the women come to some sort of resolution through the completion of their challenges, with a little room left over for the reader\u2019s interpretation.This book is emotional, but not in a forced or exploitive way. It is easy and natural to become involved with the characters\u2019 stories, to smile and cry with them along the way. The women experience personal breakthroughs, relief, and release \u2013 from hang-ups they had, or things they had been suppressing. The challenges set by Kate (and for Kate) generally end up being just what each woman needed to free herself from self-imposed shackles.If done wrong, this story structure could have become formulaic or even trite, but in Ms. Bauermeister\u2019s capable hands, it was simply satisfying.There is some lovely phrasing in the book, the kind that makes you want to buy a copy so that you can do some dog-earing and underlining. The author has a gift for creating sensuality out of mere words, which is rounded out by her firm grasp on reality and the way people\u2019s minds work. She knows a lot about love, possibly even more about good food, and she has a very clever way of entwining the two in her books.This is absolutely a woman\u2019s novel, not that a man couldn\u2019t enjoy it. It is simply about very feminine issues, however politically incorrect it may be for me to say that. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to be in a female space, even if that space is a book. It still feels safe, familiar, and nurturing.It is quite an accomplishment to create that sense of comfort in something as intangible as a story, and with Joy for Beginners, Erica Bauermeister has done it for a second time."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2561489-mary", "userReview": "Terrific book. I bought this one because I had read Bauermeister's The School of Essential Ingredients and had enjoyed it. What Bauermister excels at is relationships. For me that is what this book is about whether it's the relationships between a husband and wife (good and bad), sisters, mother's and daughters or those that are in the midst of dealing with a possibly terminal illness there was one relationship you could connect with. The story is about Kate, a cancer survivor and her friends who are meeting for what Kate calls a get-together but what her friends call a victory dinner. They didn't want to have her going to a lot of work to hostess and used their role in Kate's victory to allow them to share the work of a dinner as they shared in her healing. During the dinner one of her friends see a pamphlet about white-water rafting and asks Kate about it. When they find out its something her daughter wants her to do they all challenge her to do it. She agrees but only if she can choose a challenge for each of them. As I started reading this book I wondered how the heck the author came up with the title, Joy for Beginners as none of the women seemed joyful, - drained, relived, a little aloof but not joyful. But as the author leads us through the women's stories I understood that somewhere along the line duty or some event or just life got in the way of that joie de vivre, the basic joy in living and that by completing the challenge Kate sets for them she helps them to see or find that joy in life. Kate's challenge is something her daughter asks of her - to go white-water rafting down the Grand Canyon and Kate is left wondering why when she has just come away from a near-death experience she would want to voluntarily risk her life? The joy she finds during the experience, that all the women find, is still with me as I write this review. This book didn't make me want to create a bucket list as some reviewers discussed (although I could understand where they came from) - what it did make me want to do is to find my joy and pull it into my daily life and my career."}, {"userName": "Betty-Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5888014-betty-anne", "userReview": "I received Erica Bauermeister\u2019s second novel \u201cJoy for Beginners\u201d as an ARC from the publisher, and was delighted to find that it is, as the title itself offers, a sheer joy to read. Having read and loved her previous book, The School of Essential Ingredients, I had high hopes for this book and am delighted that it delivered.In the prologue, Kate hosts a victory party for her six closest friends to celebrate her cancer survival, and tells them of a challenge by her daughter to do the one thing that she fears most \u2013 white water rafting. Her friends make a pact with her to each do one thing that scares them if Kate does hers. Kate agrees, but only if she can choose each woman\u2019s challenge. From this point, the book separates into vignettes, each one focused on one of the women as they navigate their way through their individual challenge. In the process, you\u2019re able to learn each woman\u2019s story and immerse yourself in the character of the moment. Bauermeister allows each character her own space, but uses the thread of the friendship to keep the story connected and tie the entire book together in a satisfying way.The writing is lush and vibrant, with the author seeming to dive headlong into writing each of the varying tasks/challenges with equal passion and intensity. It makes for an enticing read, so that you want to have it go on and on. I wasn\u2019t surprised to find out that she herself had actually done some of the things she writes about the women doing for their challenges. She is also careful to leave each woman\u2019s story at a point where it has reached a conclusion of sorts, but where you can still feel that there is so much more waiting for them in their lives.Joy for Beginners is a satisfying read that says as much about the power of friendships as it does about living a full life and the satisfaction of taking a risk. Each of the characters learns much about themselves in the course of fulfilling their challenge. Additionally, I loved how much Kate really knew about her friends and how she discovered it all. This is also a great book for book clubs, as there are so many varied discussion points that arise from the story."}], "description": "\"Moving, touching, wonderfully written, inspiring to read.\" -Garth Stein, author of The Art of Racing in the RainAt an intimate, festive dinner party in Seattle, six women gather to celebrate their friend Kate's recovery from cancer.
