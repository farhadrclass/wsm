Unexpected characters die, which always makes the story difficult but for the most part they were true to the story and not just a reason to kill off more people. I'm still looking for Zoe to become less helpless. She is still relying so heavily on the men in the book and I keep wanting her to start to trust her own talents and abilities. I'll be starting book 5 so fingers crossed that starts to happen.The one nice thing is that the characters seem to interact with each other in relatively realistic manners. They are distrustful when they should be, they learn to get along and work together when need be as well.I'm looking forward to starting book 5."}, {"userName": "Secretly Adorkable Readers", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1441792-secretly-adorkable-readers", "userReview": "Wow, every book in this series just tears your heart out. They are all full of twisted emotions, tragedy, unexpected actions, with lots of zombie flesh eating roamers to boot. Fallen Grace starts where the last book ends and continues the story of the remaining survivors in a hotel. There are a lot of people you will meet but as Lewis writes them in, guess what? Lets just say just don't get attached to anyone because you don't know how long they will be there. Closer to the end, there is some unexpected findings and an unexpected death that I wasn't prepared for. I am still crying as I write this review. No spoilers****just read and find out. The book ends enough to know that there will be one more for the series."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5153617-cynthia", "userReview": "can't wait for book 5...."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512495-kimberly", "userReview": "OH COME ON M. Lauryl Lewis!! WHY did you do what you did at the end!!??..lol Seriously, I LOVED this book. The whole series is just awesome. I was starting to get a bit frustrated with the whole zombie genre, looking for something to grab my attention and renew my love for the survivors of crappy world catastrophes (mostly of the zombie variety)when I come across the first book in this series. I was like \"ok, I will give it a go\". Most times if a book does not grab my attention with in the first few chapters I will push it down the TBR endless pile. This series hooked me with the first two chapters easy, bar none! One of the many things I love about this particular series is the part our main female character, Grace, plays in this story. M. Lauryl Lewis added a supernatural ability for Grace. She can \"see\" through the zombies eyes, if they have any..lol, and she knows...most of the time...if they are around. Now most of the time you would assume that the fact that she has added a supernatural flare to this type of series would draw away from the story and make it into something that would suck, leaving the \"survivors\" to have a too easy time of it. Not so in this case. Ms. Lewis has incorporated some supernatural abilities into this story and has made it so that the group of survivors do not always rely on that alone. Our main character has had to learn not to just rely on her \"gift\" and nothing else as well. It makes for a much better story. The survivors us it as a tool. It is hard to find a zombie book with supernatural anything in it and have it be a truly good read. It is achieved beautifully in this series! She even puts creepy little zombie kids (which is truly terrifying to me!!) in this book. And not just any zombie kids, ones that sound and sometimes LOOK like normal kids! Truly diabolical..lol! I would recommend this to ANYONE who loves the Zombie genre. It is such a awesome read! There are plot twists that you do not expect, and it is a truly a good horror series! This is one of the few series/books that I have that when I begin to read, it ain't getting put down till I see the last sentence! So, join M. Lauryl Lewis's World of Zombies with the rest of us! You won't be disappointed! Keep an eye out for Praying for Grace, the 5th book in the Grace Series! To be released sometime this year! I know it is on my \"Books I am definitely buying\" list!"}, {"userName": "Allie Rashkow", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4017717-allie-rashkow", "userReview": "I hate you Ms. M. Lauryl Lewis. Actually, I love you. But seriously I hate you! Joking, joking, just joking...or not? How could you do that to us?? AH I'm dying here! I almost broke my brand new kindle fire HD after finishing the fourth installment of the \"Grace\" series. I mean HOLY CRAP how could you do that??? Yes, I'm ranting. Once you read \"Fallen Grace\" you'll understand why. Just like each of the installments in the series before it, \"Fallen Grace\" was A-Freaking-Mazing, with its many twists and turns and AWESOME zombies. I have to say it might be the creepiest one in the series with its \"Ring around the Rosie\" references (which you'll get once you read, so GET READING!). I don't know how to cope with some of the events that happen in this book. I mean, I don't cope well in real life (hello wonderful pills from the psychiatrist..Hehe) and I REALLY can't handle this! Ahh..seriously...Ahh!! I cannot even go on without saying anything that spoils the plot which is just...\"Blow your mind wow!\" So I leave with this M. Lauryl Lewis, GIVE MORE NOW!! And undo what you did! Now!

There's no doubt it would be a benefit to know before entering a house if it harbor end refuge to a rotting meat sack, however, being forced to see through their eyes and feel their hunger would freak me out. Not to mention, experiencing them eating a person.Boggs is still salty about Gus & Zoe, but the inner strife is dampened a bit. It's hard to stay mad all the time when there's no rest for the weary. Grace Fallenis packed with action. Lewis does a great job when switching gears. Her writing style is edgy and descriptive, and I can close my eyes and envision her scenes.An author after my own heart, Lewis holds nothing back when deciding to do away with a character. No one is safe, and she has no problem giving readers the grisly details as they meet their maker not once, but twice-dead.I much enjoy the first person narration, and now, four books in, it's delightful to see the character progression and growth in her three dimensional characters. The series resonates with me, and my five stars are well-deserved. It's worth mentioning that I was nervous going into this read. I'd read the first three before starting on the path of becoming a reviewer, during which time I've learned to look at a book for critique as opposed to just simply reading for enjoyment. I'm pleased to say (and relieved) that the book held up well against my scrutiny.It took me a bit to get up to speed, but that's only because i took a long break between books. My only potential feedback would serve to help my own personal whims. I could have benefited from a bit of recap before diving in.Had I paid closer attention, I'd have noticed the building climax, but I was too engrossed in the story and was blindsided by it. Honestly, I'm okay with it...without giving a spoiler...I secretly hoped something like that would happen. It's not often I get to say 'I didn't see that coming', so kudos to Lewis for getting me to say it!However, that's only a personal preference. This series is a must-read for fans on zombie fiction and I'm ecstatic that book five is already available. If you haven't started the series yet, you may consider picking up the first book on Audible and jumping right in. Now, if you'll excuse me...it's time to start the next book in Lewis' journey. --SHANA FESTA, THE BOOKIE MONSTER & AUTHOR OF TIME OF DEATH"}, {"userName": "Lesemappe Svenja", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26033408-lesemappe-svenja", "userReview": "M.

Ich kannte zwar zuvor die Serie nicht und war nat\u00fcrlich erst recht gespannt wie das Buch wohl sein mag. Es war sehr spannend zu lesen wie eine kleine Gruppe von \u00dcberlebenden um das reine \u00fcberleben k\u00e4mpft und dabei so einige Hindernisse \u00fcberwinden muss. Ein wenig erinnert mich die Geschichte zum Teil schon etwas an die bekanntere \"The Walking Dead- Serie\" die es gibt.Nicht desto trotz, von Anfang bis zum Ende ist es ein Chaos der Gef\u00fchle, mit immer neuen \u00dcberraschungen und oft tr\u00fcgt nicht nur der Schein.Die Figuren sind mit der Geschichte so gut verkn\u00fcpft, es macht einfach nur Spa\u00df zu lesen. Ich bin ja mal gespannt wann es das Buch in deutsch zu kaufen gibt , denn dieses Buch w\u00e4re eines der wenigen, welches ich mir nochmal kaufen w\u00fcrde.

I was upset about losing more people. Never in a million years, would I have thought a particular character would die. I was so heartbroken as I read what he decided as well as his fate. So now there is a baby added to the group. I almost wonder if the author will kill the child off as well, considering she has killed off so many! Just when I thought that they could lay low for a bit with the new group they encountered, I really should have known better. Still enjoying the book, even though I am upset over those that have died.Just a side note...this book was frustrating to read due to the major typos as well as having words that didn't belong, making me have to reread the sentence because it simply didn't make sense.
