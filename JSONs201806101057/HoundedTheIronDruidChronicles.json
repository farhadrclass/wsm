When the main character is a magic-wielding badass that interacts with mythological figures, it makes it harder to avoid the comparison. When the book is in first person, and the magic wielding badass is also a snarky, sarcastic wise-ass.... well... it's nigh impossible to avoid putting the two books side-by-side in my mind. That said, there are a lot of differences. And the vast majority of the things that set Atticus apart from Dresden are good things. These books are more lighthearted than the Dresden files. Atticus is less emo than Harry, and he starts off as a huge badass who is able to go toe-to-toe with some serious mythic shit right off the bat in book one. Mind you, when I say I like these differences, it's not because I dislike the way things were handled in Butcher's books. I'm saying that I like them because those are the things that make these iron Druid books distinct from the Dresden files. It gives the books their own distinct feel. Normally, I'd probably give this one a 4/5 stars. But given that it's the author's first book AND the fact that I know I was unfairly comparing this book to the Dresden files all the way through... I'm going to bump it up to 5/5."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "I loved this book! \u2764 I wasn't sure at first because lately when reading my urban fantasy books, they are taking me longer to get into and that's sad because I used to read them all of the time. At any rate, this one took off for me after a little bit and I freaking fell in love. I mean this book has so much stuff in it! All kinds of gods, references to gods, God, the devil. We have Vampire and Werewolf attorneys, goblins, ogres... gah! there is just so much. Anyhoo, so Atticus is a 2100 year old Druid, the last Druid I might add, unless of course the author brings another one into the story later. Atticus poses as 21 and owns a store that has crystals and herbs and what not. AND, he has a talking relationship with his Irish Wolfhound, Oberon. OMG! He's my new book boyfriend, er, druid. This book is both funny, narly and plenty of awesomeness. Sooooooooooooooooooooooo, this evil god dude <-- was he a god? Now I can't remember, either way he was a jerk evil demon dude and he blames Atticus for stealing his sword. The sword is named Fragarach the Answerer and it's bad to the bone, it will kill you deader than dead in a second. There is a whole history there but you can read it yourself! Atticus is living in Arizona and has been off the radar from said jerko for years, but apparently gods or demons, minions, whatever can surf the net and find people. Yeah, I know right? And Atticus was stupid enough to put his real info-ish out there. Now he is being hunted. A few things the old jerko send after Atticus to try to get the sword and kill Atticus before he gets there end up having a bad day or night. And it's amazeballs! OMG! Oh and there is the Morrigan who is the death goddess. She's on Atticus side so to speak and stuff. And Atticus has a werewolf (Hal) and a vampire (Leif) as his attorney's. I mean this is just too cool for me to handle people! There are just so many cool things that you just have to read the book. The earth energy that Atticus uses, just all kinds of stuff. Oh and the old widow lady down the street, Mrs. MacDonagh who drinks like crazy, loves Atticus and is okay with him killing stuff and having werewolf friends. Lol! She's a hoot! I'm going to leave this review with some excerpts. Some are of Oberon the dog who has an obsession with Geghis Khan and French Poodles! **EXCERPTS**\nThe bars along the wall of my shop had melted silently apart behind them and morphed into jaws of sharp iron teeth. The giant black maw reached out for them and snapped closed, scissoring through the fairies' flesh as if it were cottage cheese, and then they were inhaled like Jell-O, with time only for a startled, aborted scream. Their weapons clattered to the ground, all glamour gone, and then the iron mouth melted back into its wonted shape as a series of bars, after gracing me with a brief, satisfied grin. I got a message from the iron elemental before it faded away, in the short bursts of emotions and imagery that they use for language: //Druid calls/ Fairies await / Delicious / Gratitude//\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022There was no time to negotiate. He nodded once and said, \"They don't look very tough.\"\"They're giants using glamour, so don't trust your eyes. Use your other senses. What does their blood smell like?\" They were almost upon us, but it was a worthwhile question. Leif's eyes widened when he caught the scent of their blood. \"They are strong,\" he said. \"Thanks, Atticus.\" He grinned, his fangs lengthening as he smiled. \" I have not had my breakfast yet.\"\"Look at it like an all-you-can-eat buffet.\" I said, and then there was no more time for talking. Not one to be shy, Leif launched himself in a superhuman leap against the leading Fir Bolg, far above where his head was according to mortal eyes. That's because the giant's neck was actually about three feet higher, and the Fir Bolgs slowed down when they saw their leader taken down by a guy in an English business suit. But slowing down wasn't the same as stopping.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\"Agreed,\" the vampire said. \"I am full right now anyway. I need to work some of this off.\" He dug a cell phone out of his-or, I should say, my-breast pocket and used a speed-dial number to call someone named Antoine. \"I have dinner for the whole crew at Mitchell Park in Tempe right now. Bring the truck . . . Yes, there is enough for everybody, trust me. See you there.\" Whoa. He had ghouls on speed dial. My lawyer kicks so much ass.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022I rose from my chair and Oberon began to trot in front of me down the hall to the bathroom, his tail wagging again. *Will you tell me about Genghis Khan's whores while I'm in the bath?*Hordes, not whores. He had both, though now that you mention it. *Sounds like he was a busy guy.*You have no idea.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022*Did you get me that movie about Genghis Khan?*It's in the Netflix queue, but that's not the surprise. You don't need to worry, it'll be something good. I just don't want you to feel depressed about going home. *Oh, I won't. But it would be cool to have a stream like this in the backyard. Can you make one?*Umm. . . no.*I figured. Can't blame a hound for trying*Oberon was indeed surprised when we got back home to Tempe. Hal had made the arrangments for me, and Oberon perked up as soon as we were dropped off by the shuttle from the car rental company.*Hey, smells like someone's in my territory,* he said. Nobody could be here without my permission, you know that. *Flidais did it.*That isn't Fidais you smell, believe me. I opened the front door, and Oberon immediately ran to the kitchen window that gazed upon the backyard. He barked joyously when he saw what was waiting for him there. *French poodles! All black and curly with poofy little tails!*And every one of them in heat. *Oh, WOW! Thanks, Atticus! I can't wait to sniff their asses!* He bounded over to the door and pawed at it because the doggie door was closed to prevent poodles from entering. You earned it buddy. Hold on, get down off the door so I can open it for you, and be careful, don't hurt any of them. I opened the door, expecting him to bolt through it and dive into his own personal canine harem, but instead he took one step and stopped, looking up at me with a mournful expression, his ears drooping and a tiny whine escaping his snout. *Only five?*\nFin =)MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"}, {"userName": "Kat Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "[i actually rather liked this one. it was often frustratingly stupid and shallow and without resonance and that fucking dog was about as precious & cutesy-poo as can be imagined. this is a 2 star read but it was still a lot of fun and the celtic stuff was occasionally interesting. i will probably forget the whole experience within a few weeks. eh, at least it was semi-enjoyable while it lasted.if you are looking for resonant Urban Fantasy, read American Gods (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2958674-nikki", "userReview": "*sigh* This was quite the frustrating book to read. For the first third or so of the book I wasn't certain how I felt about it, but this was largely due to my hesitancy to jump to conclusions. Well the potential middle of the road rating quickly deteriorated to a well-deserved one star. Needless to say I will not be continuing in the series unless I am at a level of boredom I have not yet experienced.Let's start with Atticus. Atticus is supposed to be a Druid who is 2,100 years old. However, he acts like an idiotic teenager who thinks he knows it all. Atticus is far too immature to be believed as anyone who is more than a few decades old rather than 21 centuries old. Shouldn't one who has lived this long be a little more rough around the edges, a bit more wise? He makes ridiculous comments (jokes some might say if they were actually funny), is obnoxious to gods despite their ability kill him (oh please get rid of him Morrigan!), says whoa! and gadzooks (oh yes, very mature) and cannot contain his horniness despite literally being ancient. Atticus' inner dialogue is also quite clearly modern-day American and nothing like what you would expect someone who has lived so long to be. Shouldn't he be an amalgamation of the history he has lived??One of the worst scenes in the book by far? When Atticus gives a paramedic a WEDGIE while he is trying to help him with a gunshot wound. WHAT THE F%&K is that?!?!?! A freakin wedgie???? Oh yes, I think 2,100 years is enough for Atticus. He also sleeps with this or that goddess because apparently he is irresistible. Yes, the red curly hair and long goatee is just freakin unbearably irresistible (not). When all is said and done, Atticus is quite frankly who Kevin Hearne dreams he could be. Male fantasy fulfillment is splashed across every page of this book.This book is a classic example of telling not showing. Clearly the author was also trying too hard and it came through the writing. He tried hard to be funny but it just simply failed most of the time. The dialogue was stilted and the dull info-dumps were nearly unbearable. The gods in the book were unimpressive as they were never fleshed out. I was largely attracted to the book due to the Celtic mythology aspect but Hearne failed in this department as well.And then there is Oberon. Oberon does not strike me as a dog at all, just some jackass' idea of what a dog would sound like if you could communicate with him/her. I absolutely hated the storyline with Oberon wanting French poodles and then Atticus buying(?) poodles for Oberon to have his way with. Oh great, dog rape, what a grand way to end the male fantasy book!P.S. Atticus gives Oberon (a DOG) both coffee and tea in this book, both of which are TOXIC to dogs. Caffeinated drinks such as coffee and tea have a similar impact on a dog's system that chocolate does (which hopefully people know is toxic as well). I hate to think of the number of idiots who gave their dog coffee or tea after reading this book, or at least thought it was ok! So not only a poor book but it sets a terrible example as well (and that isn't even counting the wedgies....ugh)."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "Re-read 2017Because Druids are hot!I've been meaning to reread this series (and catch up on missing books) for a while now, but it took my oldest son getting into Urban Fantasy to kick my ass into gear. I gave it to him, he loved it, and then promptly wanted to talk about what had happened in the story. Aw, fuck.Yeah, I'd forgotten everything, so I had to 'refresh' my memory. Luckily, this was one of those first books in a series that wasn't bogged down by too much set up for the next installment or info-dump world building. In fact, I was kinda shocked at how well it was paced!Bonus: Thanks to my faulty memory chip, this was like reading a brand new story.Anyway, I think my original review still sums up how I feel about this one.Original review 2012It started off a little slow and clunky (my opinion), but after a few chapters things started clicking together. Really well.Atticus is a 2000 plus year old Druid who makes his home in Arizona. Other than running an occult shop (and occasionally selling fake weed to stoners), he has generally tried to lay low to avoid a powerful enemy who has been after him for over a millennium. Because he stole the guy's sword. A bad ass sword. Evidently, the Celtic god of love isn't very lovable. In fact, he's pretty pissed.And that's where the story starts...Atticus reminds me a lot of a hot Harry Dresden. I'm not saying Hearne ripped-off Butcher, though. Hearne's writing style isn't as chaotic as Jim Butcher's, for one thing. The similarity is that both characters are the kind of humorous underdogs that everyone loves to root for.Hounded is a great 1st book in what looks to be a very good urban fantasy series. I have the next one waiting for me right now, and you can bet your ass I'll be reading it as soon as I can save this review...P.SOn a side note, I loved that Thor was described as a huge douche in this book.

Sexy, redheaded Irish hero. Why, because I have a thing for red-headed guys, and I am a proud person of Irish ancestry, so I think Irish people are cool!2. Hero is a druid who can also kick butt like nobody's business. Why, because I love characters who can kick butt, and druids are so mysterious and underutilized in contemporary fantasy.3. The hero communicates with his dog. Why, because I am crazy about animals, I love the human/animal bond, and I thought Oberon was freaking hilarious with his obsessions with sniffing butts, sausage, and French Poodles.4. Celtic Mythology. Why, well that goes back to my love of the Irish and the Celts (and mythology in general). Um, I do have to say that I prefer my Christian deity, because I don't trust those Celtic gods as far as I can throw them (no offense to those who believe in Celtic pantheism).5. The Arizona setting. Why? I hate hot weather, but the desert has a raw beauty that appeals. Hearne does it very well here, and not too many books that I've read were set in Arizona.6. The variety of magical elements and beasties here. Why, because I am a fantasy nerd. Enough said!7. Swords and swordfighting. If you don't know, I can't tell you why this is cool.8. Werewolves. Why? I love werewolves. I just do. And these are Scandinavian werewolves, even cooler!9. Wicked witches. Why, because I like to read books with wicked witches!10.This book was laugh out loud funny. Why? I love to laugh.Bonus: Dang, Atticus has some good lawyers! If you haven't read this book and you enjoy all most at least 60% of what I listed, you should read this book.In all seriousness, I really enjoyed this book. I had a ball reading it!

[hails a beer vendor]Thor: I\u2019m repeatedly described as difficult, and that\u2019s a euphemism, and I\u2019m not supposed to take it so hard?Stevie: I think what Atticus is getting at is that you\u2019re much more complex than Marvel has portrayed you in the last few years.Thor: I think that\u2019s another euphemism.Lyn: Hearne never really described you, always as an off stage aside, I think it was kind of a running joke.Thor: So now I\u2019m a running joke, this is not getting better.Stevie: Well, just like Neil Gaiman did in American Gods, one of the points Hearne made was that all of the gods are real, he invested in an extremely broad and diverse universe.Atticus: But kept it with an Irish setting \u2026 even in Arizona.[crowd applauds] Atticus: Gods below!

Then the treads started up with many authors pretty much doing the same thing over and over again. Walking back to the genres has been (so far) very good with the help of many of my GR friend\u2019s reviews; I\u2019ve had a lot of luck with PNR and Romantic UFs, but haven\u2019t had the true courage to try my hand at a UF until Hounded. Hounded is a book that made me remember why I loved and miss the genre so much! There was never a true dull moment in this book, and it was hard for me to walk away without wanting to read just a few more pages\u2026! And that alone is a mark that I\u2019m soo going to enjoy this book! Atticus O\u2019Sullivan is the last Druid and for the past two thousand years has been hunted by a fae god out to get a powerful sword that Atticus has kept hidden. After so much running Atticus is tried of the BS and has finally decided to make a stand, that will involved all his knowledge and magical abilities, his friends, his vampire and werewolf lawyers and a few helpful and not so helpful visits from some gods. My impression of what Atticus would be liked was thrown out the window soon after reading the first few pages. Being around before even Jesus walked the Earth. I thought he be this stale Druid, whom be all bad moody magical power wielding dude. Oh, he one bad magical power wielding dude, but without the flash and sparkle you see now of days with other books and characters. Atticus earth magic makes him more well- earthy and that alone gives you a clue of what Atticus is about. A somewhat laid back type of guy, whom has a great sense of humor, but observant with years and years and years of knowledge and has seen things we can only read in the history books. Atticus has a great respect for everyone if you respect him in return, and a pretty normal guy when it comes to attraction when it comes to the ladies. By all accounts Atticus would be like any of one of us when walking down the street, and that gave him his great charm and made me fall hard for him. He wasn\u2019t flashy, he didn\u2019t just run into danger, and he took care of his close friend and hound Oberon. He won all points for me on the I-want-to-marry-you scale. There were also moments of deep feelings and emotions when Atticus remembers his past, but Atticus is more of a present man, and truly cherished those around him in the now as he did to those he\u2019s lost. From the get go you know the author did his homework, but instead of giving you an overdose helping of history, the author worked it very nicely into the story, making it easy to follow whose who. While the beginning was a tad slow for me, with a lot of tell and no show, it wasn\u2019t without it\u2019s moments of great humor and getting to know about the world.  The world was very open with a lot of gods and goddess running around, walking among humans. Along with werewolves, vampires. The author never lets you get confused, but gives you tidbits to help you along. There\u2019s pure humor with a vampire and a werewolf being lawyers and being paid $350 an hour! And not to forgot our human characters of a very \u201cnormal\u201d old widow who loves her whiskey and sneaks a little into church to mellow out ;D Hounded won another brownie point with me with the lack of smut. \u201cWhat!? Rane have you lost your mind, no smut!?\u201d Yup, that\u2019s right. No smut. Not that I don\u2019t love me some smut. But UF authors tend to just use them as a filler, the only part was more of a booty call off screen, which I was very happy and content with. As with any book I like to read about the hero and his heroine or the woman he\u2019ll end up with then just some random chick. Plus, again I didn\u2019t really think he even \u201cliked\u201d the goddess - and that alone was a turn off for me. So it being off screen was fine and was a show that Atticus had a healthy and active sex life period. No more information need and that was alright by me! It gave the reader time to fours more on the ongoing story.  The magical aspect of the story truly fascinated me, with much of it center around the Irish gods and goddess. It wasn\u2019t all history; much of the humor and trying to blend in, Atticus was very much up to date even more so then some others (even him being way older) Atticus did have some completion in the favorite character scale, the runner was his beloved Irish wolfhound Oberon. While he could commutate with Atticus, he was still very much a dog, with a deep love of anything meat and French poodles. He was very smart and understood much of what was going around him. Oberon was the sort of anchor that Atticus needed to stop and smell the roses once in awhile, and that\u2019s was a true friend is all about.  The battles scenes had me reading quickly, I loved the use of Atticus magic abilities and wondering what was in store next for Atticus. And were there some great surprises that like Atticus I never saw coming.  Throughout the review I mention the humor, and this book had some golden moments of humor that had me rolling in the chair. \u201cDrives in the back of an ambulance are simultaneously boring and stressful. I needed a relief from both. Paramedic Man wasn\u2019t about to talk to me anymore, so I decided to mess with him a bit. Am I above immature trickery? No. It keeps me young.  Using a bit of power recently banked in my bear charm, I bound a few of the natural threads in the elastic band of his underwear to the fine hairs in the center of his back about five inches up. The result was an instant wedgie. Those have been funny for two thousand years, but they\u2019re even more hilarious when your victim is sanctimoniously trying to behave like he knows more then you. I shouldn\u2019t have done it, though, because his reaction- a girlish squeal followed by a high octave \u201cAhhh! What the fuck!?!?\u201d and an abrupt attempt to stand up, cracks his head on the ceiling. \u2026\u201d Two great goodies of short stories with everyday happenings with Atticus and Oberon topped off my enjoyment of this book and had me marking down on my calendar the next book in the series.  Hounded brought back the joy I felt when reading a great UF keeper of a book, and with it a new rising star of an author to be on the look-out for."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "Millenia-old druid Atticus O'Sullivan has a powerful magical sword in his possession and a Celtic god wants it in the worst way. But what does that have to do with a coven of witches? And which side are Flidais and the other gods on? Can Atticus escape with his skin, even with a pack of werewolves and a vampire lawyer on his side?I had my eye open for a new urban fantasy series to try once the Dresden Files began tasting like ashes in my mouth. When the price on the ebook version of this dropped to 99 cents, my choice was made. It turned out to be a pretty good one.Atticus O'Sullivan is a 2000 year old Druid that looks like a tattooed 21 year old. Once I accepted that was the reason he sounded like a modern man, I had a lot of fun reading this.Hounded reads like the Dresden Files with a dash of American Gods thrown in. I found Atticus to be a much more likeable lead than Harry Dresden, primarily because he has personality traits above and beyond being a smart ass. Oberon, his Irish wolfhound, further sealed the deal. I liked the way Hearne depicted Atticus' magic and his Druidic abilities set him apart from a lot of other urban fantasy characters.The supporting cast was equally interesting. The vampire and werewolf lawyer combo was a pretty novel idea and I liked that he didn't overuse them. I also liked Atticus' dealings with the Celtic pantheon and how careful he was when dealing with them and the witches.The Arizona setting was a nice change of pace. The plot wasn't all that revolutionary but I thought it was well done for what it was. When dealing with the gods, a certain amount of treachery is expected and Hearne delivered the goods. It was a fun story.I'm not going to pretend it didn't have some things that irked me. Things were wrapped up a little too nicely and even though I was able to push it aside, I didn't like that Atticus talked so much like a 21st century man. I also question the wisdom of running a store that happens to sell occult books. It's not on par with Tony Stark saying Iron Man is his bodyguard or Peter Parker mysteriously getting the best pictures of Spider-Man but it's in the ballpark.Minor gripes aside, this was a really fun read and well-worth the ninety-nine cents I spent on it. I'll be looking to pick up the rest, hopefully for an affordable price.

On the one hand, it was fast paced, exciting, fun, and humorous. On the other hand, it\u2019s a little muddled, has a couple of plot holes, and is occasionally silly to the point of being cheesy. I enjoyed it, but I honestly don\u2019t know whether I would recommend it to someone else. So here is what I liked and what I didn\u2019t - you decide.Hounded has an interesting premise - a 2,100 year old Druid, along with the Celtic god of death, a magic sword, a pack of werewolves, and a witch, face down the villainous Celtic god of love. Sounds fun, right? It is certainly is a fun read, with enough action to move the plot along at a fast clip. My first problem, though, was with the mythology. It\u2019s cool that Atticus is a Druid and gets to use his awesome Druid powers to fight bad guys, and I also like how random Celtic gods keep showing up to mess with him. But this story doesn\u2019t just embrace Irish mythology - it tries to encompass every mythology. That\u2019s right, every god and monster known to man is real, including Jesus, the Virgin Mary, Allah, Thor, vampires, ghouls, and so on. While this premise provides the potential for all kinds of craziness and trouble to ensue, it also muddies the waters a bit too much in my opinion. It feels like the author is trying to do everything and the story could easily get out hand with all these supernatural figures running around. Perhaps it would have been cleaner and more plausible if it had just focused on Celtic mythology and left the rest alone.Despite the muddled world building, the plot was pretty good. The identity of the villain is no secret, but the loyalties of the various gods and witches are never certain. Almost everyone has ulterior motives, and it\u2019s not easy to figure out who\u2019s trustworthy and who\u2019s not. That being said, there were a couple of tiny plot holes that really bugged me. You\u2019ll recognize them when you find yourself thinking, \u201cThat... doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dThe characters are likable, if not realistic. Atticus acts like he\u2019s fifteen at times, but he\u2019s a hero you can root for. My favorite character by far is Atticus\u2019 Irish wolfhound, Oberon. He\u2019s funny and adorable, and he\u2019s largely responsible for why I like Atticus. The Celtic gods are also intriguing, and several of them have the hots for Atticus. It\u2019s not sexy so much as it\u2019s silly and amusing, but it doesn\u2019t reach the level of cheesy that is the character Mrs. MacDonagh, the elderly, Irish widow that lives in Atticus\u2019 neighborhood. I think she\u2019s supposed to provide comic relief, but her antics and attitudes border on the ridiculous. No one would act the way she does, making her character little more than a cartoon. Some of the other supporting characters are thin as well, but that\u2019s to be expected in a first installment when the cast is just starting to be introduced.Regardless of its deficiencies, Hounded gets major points for making me laugh out loud. Atticus has some pretty cheesy one-liners, but other parts are truly hilarious. For example, I was cracking up as I read the paragraph where Atticus explains how he is able to cry on cue. (I won\u2019t spoil it.) Oberon\u2019s obsession with Genghis Khan and French poodles also gave me some genuine laughs.Overall, Hounded is funny and entertaining, an enjoyable read despite the problems I have with the overambitious mythology, the plot holes, and the cheesy characters. It\u2019s a decent debut with plenty of room for improvement as the series progresses. I might pick up the next book, Hexed, when I feel in the mood for some light reading and a few laughs.(Note: This is a review of the advance reader\u2019s edition of Hounded.

He's got a dry sense of humor, doesn't spew pretty language for the sake of having to impress anyone, and spends a good portion of his time communicating with man's best friend - yep, a dog. A very intelligent dog who happens to be loyal and helpful in a pinch, but would rather be eating sausages and banging french poodles. Oh yeah, and this Atticus guy carries a big sword. And works some badass magic. And makes comparisons of things and circumstances with Hot Pockets and Star Wars in random conversations. Review for the females :Atticus is smart, pulls no punches, and is going to let you know straight up if he's interested. He's an ancient druid and is the kind of sexy in a way you'd find from meeting one of those casual cool guys who knows he's all that, but doesn't seem to really care or pay attention to it.This book is an action filled, gender-neutral Urban Fantasy that will appeal to the people who are tired of fluffy paranormals. I took to Atticus and his story immediately, in a way that I wish I could have with Dresden Files (don't worry DF fans...I'll get back there eventually, I promise!).I hear the books get even better, so I'm hyped.

Sometimes I want a fantasy that keeps things light and funny. Sometimes, I want a fantasy that is a happy medium between the two, something that isn\u2019t dense and has humor, but where there are real stakes to the hardships facing the protagonist. That\u2019s when I turn to Urban Fantasy. Some UF series (and most of them are series) are superior to others. While I like what I\u2019ve read of the Dresden Files and the Hollows series, the Anita Blake series and the Black Dagger Brotherhood soured for me, relying too heavily on sex instead of plot. Then there are series like The Others by Anne Bishop and the Mercedes Thompson series by Patricia Briggs, both of which I love. So when I start a new UF series, I never know which of those three possible feelings it will inspire in me. Judging from this first book, the Iron Druid series is at least in the \u201clike\u201d category, and I can see that growing into love.Atticus O\u2019Sullivan is a fantastic UF protagonist. Far older than he appears, he balances between his physical youth and mental maturity with a fair amount of aplomb. He\u2019s the last of the Druids, and a powerful one at that. But that power, along with his unnatural longevity, has ensured that he has more than a few powerful enemies. As with most UF protagonists, he\u2019s constantly on the wrong side of angry beings far more powerful than he is, and he has to protect himself with his wit and a little help from his friends.My favorite of those friends, and one of the few who isn\u2019t supernatural in some way, is Oberon. Oberon is Atticus\u2019s Irish wolfhound, who can communicate with Atticus via a telepathic link the druid has developed between them. This canine companion provided the lion\u2019s share of the comic relief. He\u2019s well versed in pop culture, and his references mingled with his doggy sarcasm made for a lot of laughs.Probably my least favorite thing about this book was that the protagonist\u2019s main weakness was his libido. The man needs to simmer down around the ladies, be they goddess or mortal. However, he knows himself, and it\u2019s something that he\u2019s working on, so I can overlook it. Also, that horniness made for some funny moments. So, while this particular aspect of the protagonist's character annoyed me, it by no means hindered my enjoyment.One last reason that I believe that I enjoyed this book more than some other UF offerings is the lore. There's just something about Irish lore that has always fascinated me, and having that in a 21st century American setting was a lot of fun. Watching the archaic attempting to mingle with modernity was incredibly entertaining, and is a big draw for me continuing with the series.All in all, this was a really fun book, and I fully intend to continue the series. This is another series with audiobooks narrated by the phenomenal Luke Daniels, which added to my enjoyment.Original review can be found at Booknest."}, {"userName": "Denisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14215152-denisa", "userReview": "1.5 NopeIt's not for me.

His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old--when in actuality, he\u2019s twenty-one centuries old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer.Unfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and he\u2019s hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down, and Atticus will need all his power--plus the help of a seductive goddess of death, his vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a sexy bartender possessed by a Hindu witch, and some good old-fashioned luck of the Irish--to kick some Celtic arse and deliver himself from evil.My Review: The Doubleday UK meme, a book a day for July 2014, is the goad I'm using to get through my snit-based unwritten reviews. Today's prompt, the 28th, is to discuss your favorite animal in fiction. Who else could it be but Oberon the Wolfhound?Let me start with this:There are many perks to living for twenty-one centuries, and foremost among them is bearing witness to the rare birth of genius. It invariably goes like this: Someone shrugs off the weight of his cultural traditions, ignores the baleful stares of authority, and does something his countrymen think to be completely batshit insane. Of those, Galileo was my personal favorite. Van Gogh comes in second, but he really was batshit insane.Now, I ask you. Can a normally-constructed reader of any but the grimmest and least amusant of books fail to see the humor in that? I am on record as being no fan of phauntaisee nawvelles with their styoopid Misspelynnges and Random capitaLizations to indicate magjickq is in Use. So I approach each recommended genre book with, well, trepidation. (I'm stretching for polite words that mean \"strenuous desire to insult author, publisher, and recommender.\") So these couple of ladies here on LT tag-teamed me, beat my head into the mat, kicked my nose through the back of my head, and started breaking bones I can't operate without until I got this book and read it.When you're in the middle of a killing field and the fucking Chooser of the Slain tells you to do something, you do it.Yeah. That.The more observant of my readers will have noted the four-star rating above. This was not in the least a foregone conclusion, even with the chuckles and the muffled hoots the book provided. I am not any kind of a fan of straight-people sex, having memories of same that range from boredom on the high end all the way down to horror. Three stars is the most I'll give anything with more than a token window-dressing of girl-sex. Yes, I know lots of people do it, but it's icky and I don't want to hear about it. That fourth star?Monty Python is like catnip for nerds. Once you get them started quoting it, they are constitutionally incapable of feeling depressed.Okay, Hearne. I'm gaffed through the gills. Yes, my mouth still fills with nausea-water at the sex, but you've hit The Nerve. Wry and funny? Yes please. Handsome, tattooed, and Irish? TRIFECTA! Twenty-one hundred years old and talks like a lamebrained kid? Well...I have been around long enough to discount most superstitions for what they are: I was around when many of them began to take root, after all. But one superstition to which I happen to subscribe is that bad juju comes in threes. The saying in my time was, \"Storm clouds are thrice cursed,\" but I can't talk like that and expect people to believe I'm a twenty-one year-old American. I have to say things like, \"Shit happens, man.\u201dAnd now we're on a different plane of storytelling. In the voice of the character, the author explains why anachronism is alive and well, and does so with a level of character development that shows something I don't get very often in any book: Respect for the reader. \"I'm telling you a story about an immortal magical being who lives in the armpit of creation, USA, voluntarily, and needs to blend in as much as possible. Here is how it's done, why it's done, and what you can expect from the character.\"Not only is the fourth star secured to the sleeve with tiny, tough stitches, but the sale is made for book two and book three. Of seven (I think), mind you, but still that's more than I'd even *dream* of doing absent this surprising development.As Atticus himself said, \u201cWinning ugly is still winning.\u201d \nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Laurence", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11640810-laurence", "userReview": "By any objective standard, this is an awful book. It has a childishly simple plot, which still manages to get buried under page after page of the sort of clumsy exposition and background information that can only be shovelled on by an author who clearly believes the 'show, don't tell' adage applies to other people. It has a supporting cast of characters who, when they're not cheap caricatures lifted directly from Urban Fantasy for Dummies are so poorly fleshed out as to be virtually non-existent. And it has a narrator/protagonist who is supposedly two thousand years old and Irish, yet carries on an internal monologue that is entirely twenty-first century American at all times, complete with pop-culture references that never stray to older than a decade. Although I suppose this could be something of a blessing, as if the central character had been in a similar vein to the elderly Irish neighbour who's conversation seems entirely limited to 'Top of the morning!', 'You'll never get me Lucky Charms!' and 'Kill the English', I'd probably have burned the whole book in disgust.You could probably get away with those problems though. Whilst being chronologically and ethnically confused, the protagonist Atticus O'Sullivan has a certain charm about him, and is occasionally quite amusing. What kills the book is that he's also the worst kind of adolescent wish fulfilment super-powered stupidity. As mentioned, he's two thousand years old. And the last of the druids. And has ridiculously over-done magic powers. And he's a great swordsmen. And has a magic sword that can cut through anything. And is friends with a vampire and some werewolves. And the goddess of death. Oh, and he has a talking dog. Effectively he has the super-power of being able to kill drama. It's probably not a good idea to have your protagonist fighting gods in the first novel of a series anyway, but if you must at least have them rely on luck, or cunning, or their opponent's over confidence and arrogance, or at least a lot of help. Don't whatever you do just have them go toe to toe and win through being better at everything. In a perverse way, it's actually sort of impressive that at one point our hero gets shot in the chest, and Hearne is still unable to generate even the slightest sense of peril. I'm guessing the author thinks that the existence of kryptonite spoils Superman.But having said all that, somehow it still manages to be sort of fun. Fun like reading bad Harry Potter fan fiction, where for some reason Harry is brought up by ninjas, given bionic limbs and defeats Voldemort in a light sabre duel on the bridge of an exploding airship that's crashing into an erupting volcano. Fun that makes you feel kind of dirty and ashamed, and feeling you've somehow betrayed your intellect and critical faculties by getting caught up in it all. But still fun. It's a book that your inner twelve-year old will enjoy every minute of. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing, once in a while.Just don't tell anyone else you liked it.

Atticus is the first praciticing druid I've read about in a long while, and it's nice to have a new take on magic in the urban fantasy line. In fact, all sorts of immortals and deities seem to be present, particularly from Celtic and Norse mythologies. They actually behave a lot like the stereotypes of gods from mythology (at least in the Greek myths I read), which is to say, manipulative, egotistical and randy. Hearne does a nice job of balancing their scary powers with approachability. Just like the Greek gods--sometimes you could wheedle a favor out of them if you had the right gift. Vampires, werewolves and witches also play a role in the action.Characters are very likeable, although at first Atticus really seems a lot like a moderately interesting 25 year old rather than a 2100 year old druid. That's one of my only complaints about the series to date; I just don't have the feel of great age behind him, only power. Sure, his running a store in the middle of campus might keep him in contact with current culture, but I expect him to be a little more ponderous and thoughtful. Oberon the wolfhound kept me laughing, especially the running joke about \"Oberon Khan.\" I like their banter, and Atticus' consideration for their relationship.Hearne's attempt to fully integrate the 'real world' of police, persistent detectives and nosy neighbors is interesting too--so many urban fantasy books have the cops either on the \"clueless\" or \"colluding\" list, that it's another interesting take to seem them behaving normally.I like the small touches, like the bar with the best fish and chips, and the lawyerly behavior of both vampire and werewolves. I do think the big battle was over too quickly for it to feel satisfying for the build-up; it was the only moment that pacing felt truly disruptive. Otherwise, hugely enjoyable and I'll definitely keep reading the series.Cross-posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/0..."}, {"userName": "Regina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3104032-regina", "userReview": "[ that the police and a specific officer are under the control of his enemy.

I have to admit that my general reaction to Urban Fantasy is somewhat less than warm, but for some odd reason I can't quite figure out, I still get sucked right in and I enjoy some of them immensely. I started with Laurell K Hamilton, and even stayed with it through the myriad sexcapades. Then I was heavily surprised and overjoyed with Kim Harrison (and still am). Then, missing my guilty UF pleasures, I decided to go for Jim Butcher and was also very deeply pleased by it all. I've read a few others and haven't been that impressed. This being said, I'm still willing to try out others from the genre, just in case.I cannot say this novel is going to be ranking at the best that those other series can produce, at least until I've seen a progressive arc in story and character development. What I can talk about is the premise and possibilities. We're starting with a strong character from the get go. Think about a 4th through 8th book leveled-up main character starting out in book one instead. Allow him no serious hang-ups (read as plot) sex, money, or drugs. He's a little over two KA old and the last of the ancient druids and he's often an unwilling pawn to Irish gods. So far, so good. Now he's developing dramatic tension. His best friend is his dog, but most of the book (besides some killer action sequences) is going to be simple introduction of characters that will almost certainly be introduced in later books. This, in itself, is a good thing because I've gotten the first five. Without introducing spoilers, I will say that we've got a satisfactory plot, albeit straight as an arrow.Not too bad for a first in a series. I think most people read UF to be gratified by sexy characters, big action, big magic, and most importantly, easy reads. If so, this is definitely their kind of book. I like the initial premise, too, but then again, I like books with great ideas. Mind you, there's not a ton of them here, yet, but there are a few and I like what I see. Never judge a UF by only one book, regardless.

A 2100-year-old Druid using the alias Atticus O\u2019Sullivan is enjoying life in Arizona with his Irish wolfhound, a talking dog with a French poodle obsession. The plot is very simple: He has a sword this god-enemy wants. The enemy sends minions to get it. When they\u2019re all gone, the enemy finall shows up himself to get the sword. Atticus is so powerful, we\u2019re never worried for his safety. Ever. It\u2019s light and funny with a sort of Harry Dresden vibe. Atticus often comes across as cocky and immature. I imagined him played by Nathan Fillion, and that worked well. Harrison Ford would probably work, too.The audio narration is very good. There is some strong language throughout and some sexual innuendo. The violence is more humorous than graphic."}], "description": "Atticus O\u2019Sullivan, last of the Druids, lives peacefully in Arizona, running an occult bookshop and shape-shifting in his spare time to hunt with his Irish wolfhound. His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old\u2014when in actuality, he\u2019s twenty-one centuries old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer.Unfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and he\u2019s hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down, and Atticus will need all his power\u2014plus the help of a seductive goddess of death, his vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a bartender possessed by a Hindu witch, and some good old-fashioned luck of the Irish\u2014to kick some Celtic arse and deliver himself from evil.", "title": "Hounded\n      \n          (The Iron Druid Chronicles #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9533378-hounded", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327883998l/9533378.jpg", "reviews": 5915, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4414255.Kevin_Hearne", "name": "Kevin Hearne"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Fantasy", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9533378-hounded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10877244-hounded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23496248-hounded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12068520-hounded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10948773-hounded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12279393-hounded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9595650-hexed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9595620-hammered", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12700306-tricked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13536649-trapped", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16071748-hunted"]}
