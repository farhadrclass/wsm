And, if this book were, say, a seven-page article in a magazine, I would rip it out, keep it for reference, and recommend it to friends. The problem is that this is not a seven-page article. It is a 260-page book. 260 pages of fluff, filler, and drawings. 260 pages to essentially inform the reader that calming a newborn takes \"the 5 S's\" (swaddling, side/stomach positioning, shhh'ing, swinging, and sucking). How does one turn seven pages of material into a 260-page book? Oh, it's easy. First, fill the book with nonsense. Here is an actual quote from the book: \"I think a breast-feeding mom should be called Galactic Goddess!\" No, really. Actual quote. Second, use obviously-fictional \"testimonials\" from parents who have succeeded with your technique. My favorite is the one about the father who was so good at swaddling that, when he was at work as a lawyer, and his clients brought a screaming baby to the office, he was able to calm the baby in moments. Answer me this: Who the hell brings their screaming baby to their lawyer's office??? Oh, and let's not forget the \"testimonial\" from the Russian immigrant. She tells the author, \"You don't have to show me dat. In my willage, we wrap dem and put BELT around. It holds dem wery good.\" In case you missed that she is a Russian immigrant, the author makes sure to underline \"dat,\" \"willage,\" \"dem,\" and \"wery\" so that you, the reader, can't miss it. Oh, those crazy immigrants with their crazy accents! So many times, I wanted to hurl this book across the room. I only finished it (a) because my husband insisted, and (b) to better be able to rant about it. Apparently, there is a DVD. This is perhaps the only time I would recommend the movie over the book."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/754138-ryan", "userReview": "I will save you the 336 pages: suck, swaddle, shush, side position, swing. Wow, 5 Ss. That's inventive.4 years of medical school and better than 4th grade writing skills can generate a book like this. You know what? Forget it: Just make your last name MD. Have someone fill in the sources and make the book run a bit over 100 pages. The fact that Americans (including myself) are looking for instructions allows tripe like this onto the bookshelf to sell millions of copies. It's also why serious literary talent like Mark Leyner will probably never write a postmodernist masterpiece like Tetherballs at Bougainville again: because his medical book, Why Do Men Have Nipples, coauthored with another MD (Billy Goldberg) sold more copies than all of his real masterpieces combined.

I remember that the audience was full of QUIET, contented babies and I wondered if they were all sedated.The premise is that human babies are born 3 months BEFORE they are really developed because of the size of their heads. Therefore, the fist 100 days of their life is virtually a \"fourth trimester\" in which the baby needs constant vigilance and caring.He offers \"cuddle cure\"... 5 steps done in sequence to calm a baby and simulate life in the womb: Swaddling (firmly), Side/Stomach, Ssshhhing, Swaying, Sucking.

Only after your screaming baby pauses for a few moments can you gradually slow your motion, soften your shushing and guide them from frenzy to soft landing.The best colic-calmers say that soothing an infant is like dancing with them in the lead. These talented people pay close attention to the vigor of ther 5 \"S's\"p.1251st S- SwaddlingThis TURNS on the calming effect by stopping the Moro reflex (hand jerking/flailing) that helps them to pay attention to the other S's.2nd S-Side/StomachLay your child on their side or place them in your arms on their stomach. This prevents them from feeling that they are falling.3rd S- ShhhhYou have to do it as LOUD AS YOUR BABIES CRY and close to their ear. It stimulates the sound of the womb. It can be replaced by white noise.4th S- SwaySupport your babies head and neck and wiggle their HEAD with fast, tiny movements (like you are shivering). Once they are entranced, you can move to a slower swinging motion.5th S- SuckingThis works best after the other S's have calmed. A finger or pacifier work and can be eliminated after the 3rd month.p.195Baby Massage.In a 1986 study by Tiffany Field, massaged babies gained 47% more then babes who did not have the same touch. The same babies had higher IQ's a year later.1. Prepare for pleasure. Warm the room, dim the lights, play soft music.2. Bring Yourself to the moment. Sit comfortably, take 5 slow deep breaths and allow yourself to be present for the experience. Its an exchange of love in one fleeting, tender moment of time.3. Speak to your baby with your hands. Always try to keep one hand in contact with the skin and talk to them about what you are doing and what your hopes are for their life, or sing a lullaby. Let your massage strokes move in synchronicity with your calm breathing.4. Reward your babies tummy. Bicycle their legs then firmly push both knees to their belly and hld them there for 20 seconds. Massage the tummy in firm, clockwise, circular strokes - starting at their right lower belly, up and across the top of their tummy and ending at their left lower side (this traces their colon and intestines) 5.

For example, I skimmed the entire first half of the book. And there are just so many darned testimonials from his patients - perhaps a fifth of the book is testimonials. Why? To make this actually book-length, I suppose. Oh, and for your mental well-being you should probably skip the section listing all the rare medical conditions that can lead to colic. So, anyway, there are just nuggets...But what nuggets! Solid gold advice.This book is, supposedly, addressed to parents of colicky babies, but honestly any new parent can use the key advice. My baby isn't colicky but using this advice helped him (and us) sleep much, much better at night, and calms him down when need be. We went from spending 1 1/2 hours calming him down after his middle-of-the-night feeding (and really I think he just cried himself to sleep) to spending 20 minutes helping him drift back to sleep using some of this advice. I recommend expecting parents read the sections on the \"5 S's\" and then read them again after they have the baby. The advice is only good for newborns - the first 3 to 5 months - so there's no reason to put off reading this. I read the good sections when our baby was 3 1/2 weeks old and I wish I'd read it 4 weeks earlier. Lastly, you don't need to use this advice verbatim. Go with what your baby likes. For example, our baby doesn't like the side-hold recommended by this book - I just replace that 'S' with one of his two favorite ways to be held. These are guidelines, not rules, and every baby is different."}, {"userName": "Lisa R.

His only pseudo-scientific claims (some dealing with evolution) are always prefaced by \"I believe\" or \"I am convinced,\" completely undercutting any real value these statements might hold and revealing the utter lack of actual scientific research. Here's his most scientific sentence: \"Actually, the [5 S's] trigger a profound neurological response never before recognized or reported--until today.\" Sounds like he's hawking some miracle hair growing ointment. Oh, and he's just a dick: \"In many ways, the people living in primitive cultures are backward compared to Western societies\" (7). He amends his comments later...on page 84, \"Please don't be fooled by the word 'primitive.'

I am noticing a common problem: the author has a good or even great idea, piece of advice, research, or insight into the human condition. This idea can be adequately communicated in, say, 5 or 10 pages. But, the author would like to make some money off this idea, and therefore goes shopping for a book deal. The publishers would like to sell a hardback at $20 and a bunch of paperbacks at $8 to $15. Obviously no-one will pay that for a 10 page book. So, the author and/or his ghost writers wrap his simple idea up into 150 to 200 pages of repetitive, often intelligence insulting prose. \"The Happiest Baby\" is perhaps one of the worst examples of this trend I've yet come across. The entire book may be summed up in two points: 1) Babies aged 0 to 3 months who are in no true pain or hunger can usually be rapidly calmed by recreating a womb-like environment, which can be done by following the \"5 S's\" (Swaddling, side position, shushing, swinging, and sucking. Read the book if you want the details.) 2) It is OK to do this whenever your baby cries in this age range, because you cannot \"spoil\" a child still in its \"fourth trimester.\" This is pretty much all we need to know. But Dr. Karp, in an obvious effort to get his word count up, spends chapter upon chapter discussing colic, why the commonly ascribed causes cannot be correct, why his explanation makes the most sense, dozens of anecdotal examples, etc, etc, etc. One must wade through all this before getting to the meat of the plan, which is neatly summarized in a two-page diagram in the middle of the book. Errgh.I always tend towards written vs. audio/visual material. Perhaps in this case, however, the DVD would have been a better bet. My baby isn't born yet, but from the number of parents who recommended this video, I've no real doubt that \"The 5 S's\" will work for us and save us and our son much frustration - especially if he turns out to be \"colicky.\" Frankly, that's more than worth the price of admission ($13 at Target.) But it does leave me wishing that the current perverse incentives on self-help authors could be somehow reduced so I could waste less time on this sort of literature. (For what it's worth, my husband, who has a PhD, assures me that the problem is just as significant in dissertations. He estimates that roughly 10% of his 200 page thesis contained his actual \"contribution to the field.\" The rest was largely irrelevant...) UPDATE: Either I am in a better mood today, or the last 4-6 chapters in the book were far more worthwhile than the first 4-6. :) Seriously, there was some good info in the latter 1/4 of the book on how to tell if your baby is really sick, how to transition away from the \"S's\" when your child is 4 months old or so, etc. So if you're reading this book, scan the first 1/2, pay close attention to the exact techniques in the middle, and read to the end."}, {"userName": "Kylene", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4456697-kylene", "userReview": "Well, I think boo to the apps on the phone. I had a very thorough review posted on here, and it got erased while I was using the Goodreads app on my Droid (I was putting baby to sleep and needed something to do while I was waiting to put her down).But I digress... 4 stars to this book. Yes there is a lot of fluff, but it really helps you understand why baby is crying and why they need what the author is saying they need. I think this book is better read PRIOR to baby being born. I could imagine a sleep-deprived parent getting frustrated with the author's fluff and just wanting the meat and potatoes. (I know that was the case for me, anyway. I wish I would have read this prior to her being born, or at least had a copy of it to thumb through instead of ordering it from Amazon out of desperation in week 3 and choosing the free shipping, which meant it didn't come for another 1-2 weeks....but again, I digress.)Also, I have to say that I appreciate the reviews of certain readers who read the book for classes or because they are pregnant for the first time and have no child-rearing experience. HOWEVER, until you are up at 1am, 3am, 5am and 6am with a colicky baby and all you want is more than 15 minutes of uninterrupted sleep and your baby is screaming despite all your best efforts and you don't know what to do...I can't say that I trust your review, especially if you rated the book poorly. I would be more likely to trust the reviews of those who have been in the baby trenches and have tried these principes and can give a fair review to the book."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1215194-danielle", "userReview": "I'd recommend getting the DVD instead of this book. It's just as repetitious, but it's much shorter to get through, and you don't miss anything from the book.10,000 stars for the ideas contained within the book, 2 stars for presentation. The author is really repetitious with his ideas, so I ended up skimming most of it. However, the ideas work wonders for my baby! The 5 S's were things that I naturally tried, either from instinct to comfort the baby or from experience/watching other mothers. But I wasn't using them effectively together, and that's what this book/DVD helped me to do.My baby (currently 3 weeks old) is a pro night-sleeper, waking up to feed every 3-4 hours. However, during the day I have problems getting her to sleep for more than 1 hour at a time; even when she's in desperate need of a nap, she won't stay asleep. The methods in this book helped her sleep for longer stretches during the day (which means I can actually get something done!), which makes her less fussy when she's awake, and in turn she's much more fun to be around now! For the record, she HATES having her arms swaddled, but when combined with the jiggling/white noise (we use radio static at a low volume), she loves a full swaddle."}, {"userName": "J Melachrinos", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19775572-j-melachrinos", "userReview": "Very helpful book.

This calm has been punctuated by episodes of deep dread and doubt that still fell natural and healthy. As things have progressed, my nerves have gotten a bit more rattled. Labor and delivery is intimidating and the idea of bringing our new child home and then just starting life over again seems beyond the realm of the possible. This book was a comfort even as it made me feel like an insane person. I'm convinced that Baby books are things you read in a frenzy and what you remember in the moment is what you needed. This book and many in the genre are written in a repetitive, anecdotal style I imagine is designed for desperate new parents who haven't slept in 36 hours. I will use the jiggly motion. I will master the snug swaddle. I will let my child guide me into this new chapter of my life. Recommended."}], "description": "In perhaps the most important parenting book of the decade, Dr. Harvey Karp reveals an extraordinary treasure sought by parents for centuries --an automatic \u201coff-switch\u201d for their baby\u2019s crying.No wonder pediatricians across the country are praising him and thousands of Los Angeles parents, from working moms to superstars like Madonna and Pierce Brosnan, have turned to him to learn the secrets for making babies happy.Never again will parents have to stand by helpless and frazzled while their poor baby cries and cries. Dr. Karp has found there is a remedy for colic. \u201cI share with parents techniques known only to the most gifted baby soothers throughout history \u2026and I explain exactly how they work.\u201dIn an innovative and thought-provoking reevaluation of early infancy, Dr. Karp blends modern science and ancient wisdom to prove that newborns are not fully ready for the world when they are born. Through his research and experience, he has developed four basic principles that are crucial for understanding babies as well as improving their sleep and soothing their senses. \u00b7The Missing Fourth Trimester: as odd as it may sound, one of the main reasons babies cry is because they are born three months too soon.\u00b7The Calming Reflex: the automatic reset switch to stop crying of any baby in the first few months of life.\u00b7The 5 \u201cS\u2019s\u201d: the simple steps (swaddling, side/stomach position, shushing, swinging and sucking) that trigger the calming reflex. For centuries, parents have tried these methods only to fail because, as with a knee reflex, the calming reflex only works when it is triggered in precisely the right way. Unlike other books that merely list these techniques Dr. Karp teaches parents exactly how to do them, to guide cranky infants to calm and easy babies to serenity in minutes\u2026and help them sleep longer too.\u00b7The Cuddle Cure: the perfect mix the 5 \u201cS\u2019s\u201d that can soothe even the most colicky of infants.In the book, Dr. Karp also explains:What is colic?Why do most babies get much more upset in the evening?How can a parent calm a baby--in mere minutes?Can babies be spoiled?When should a parent of a crying baby call the doctor?How can a parent get their baby to sleep a few hours longer?Even the most loving moms and dads sometimes feel pushed to the breaking point by their infant\u2019s persistent cries. Coming to the rescue, however, Dr. Karp places in the hands of parents, grandparents, and all childcare givers the tools they need to be able to calm their babies almost as easily as\u2026turning off a light.", "title": "The Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/132900.The_Happiest_Baby_on_the_Block", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387740973l/132900.jpg", "reviews": 2481, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1017070.Harvey_Karp", "name": "Harvey Karp"}], "type": ["Parenting", "Nonfiction", "Self Help"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/132900.The_Happiest_Baby_on_the_Block", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445919.The_Happiest_Baby_on_the_Block", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1442171.The_Happiest_Baby_on_the_Block", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19508402-mahallenin-en-mutlu-bebe-i", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7219218-the-happiest-baby-on-the-block", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8123744-the-happiest-baby-on-the-block", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26873424-the-happiest-baby-on-the-block-fully-revised-and-updated-second-edition", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25387382-the-happiest-baby-on-the-block", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/352323.The_Happiest_Toddler_on_the_Block", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13426360-the-happiest-baby-guide-to-great-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13641900-the-happiest-baby-on-the-block-and-the-happiest-toddler-on-the-block-2-b", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1000356.Baby_Bliss", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36951350-nej-astn-j-miminko-v-okol", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
