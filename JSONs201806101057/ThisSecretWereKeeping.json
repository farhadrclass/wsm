This book is about a relationship that develops between a teacher and one of his fifteen year old pupils. Before reading it, I was a little cautious about it. There are so many potential things that could have made me dislike this book, but almost instantly I fell in love with this story. I loved the style it was written in, the way it moved back and forth between the 1990s and present day, filling the reader in on what happened back then, and how that impacted on the two main characters over the years. Which leads me onto those characters. What great characters, very likeable and well-developed. It was impossible not to get emotionally involved in their lives, both past and present.I couldn\u2019t put this book down, didn\u2019t want it to end, and oh my goodness, my heart and mind still haven\u2019t quite worked out what to do with the ending. Such an emotional roller coaster that even brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion.If you enjoy character driven novels about controversial romance, with some suspense and a lot of emotion, then this is probably the book for you.I would like to thank the publisher, Penguin UK (Michael Joseph) for allowing me a copy of this book via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "This is an emotional roller coaster of a story which I adored. It is a character driven novel, and the author has created two superb and realistic characters and developed them well. The relationship between the two of them is seen through the lens of two time periods. The two of them have an intense, deep and emotionally involving affair. Matthew as a teacher goes to prison for having a relationship with 15 year old Jess. 17 years later, Matthew has a new identity, Will, when the two of them meet again. They are drawn to each other again despite their fraught history. The author is adept at handling feelings and emotions with real skill.

Pur essendo etichettato come Thriller dalla CE italiana, \u00e8 lampante che invece ci troviamo di fronte a un Forbidden Romance in piena regola, con l'aggiunta di un pizzico di Mistery che non guasta di certo! Conoscevo bene l'opinione delle lettrici italiane, dopo l'uscita del romanzo, ma ci\u00f2 non mi ha dissuaso dall'acquistarlo \u2014 e ne sono estremamente felice!

Anzi, direi che le ha superate!Questa \u00e8 la storia di Jessica e Matthew, che diciassette anni prima erano rispettivamente studentessa quindicenne e insegnante. Io ho una passione esagerata per le relazioni proibite tra i banchi di scuola, se vanno come devono andare \u2014 e in questo libro ho letteralmente perso la testa!Abbiamo due diversi PoV: quello di Jess, in terza persona, nel presente e quello di Matthew, in prima persona, nel passato. Uno stile che ho gi\u00e0 incontrato e che non mi \u00e8 dispiaciuto affatto (:Il legame tra i due personaggi mi \u00e8 entrato sotto la pelle. \u00c8 immenso, lo percepiamo immediatamente, e ti trascina gi\u00f9, gi\u00f9, gi\u00f9.

E non c'erano esitazioni, questa volta, nessun permesso da attendere, nessuna delicata esplorazione preleminare: in un istante aveva la sua lingua in bocca, il suo corpo addosso. Il sapore di lui era caldo, inebriante.\u00a0Fecero insieme qualche passo barcollante, finch\u00e9 Jess non si ritrov\u00f2 la schiena contro il guardaroba. Will la stringeva per le spalle, baciandola con un trasporto sempre maggiore, premendo su di lei. \u00abSei tu\u00bb mormor\u00f2.

L'ho amato, dico davvero. Un uomo vero, non stereotipato, comune. Un uomo pieno di debolezze e insicurezze. Un uomo che non ha colpe, se non quella di amare la sua anima gemella con tutto se stesso, anno dopo anno.Le arringhe finali di questo ROMANZO FANTASTICO mi hanno fatto ribollire di rabbia e salire l'istinto omicida a livelli stellari.

As I read this book I was constantly reminding myself that Jess was a child, aged 15, yet she made all the moves and was the strongest character in the book. Was it true love , infatuation or just a 25 year old teacher taking advantage of a vulnerable girl? Jess had a mother who was too heavily dependent upon drugs and drink to pay her any attention and Matthew was the one person she spoke to who listened to her.Matthew Langley is a 25 year old teacher at a girls school in Norfolk, Jessica is a 15 year old pupil. Their love affair led to scandal, arrest and imprisonment. 17 years later Matthew is back in Norfolk. He is now known as Will, has a daughter Charlotte and a girlfriend Natalie. Jess is a self employed caterer and still living in Norfolk with an on/ off boyfriend Zak, who wants her to move to London with him where he works as an A and E consultant .Matthew and Jess become reacquainted when she steps out in front of his car and he knocks her over. Old memories of their love affair are rekindled and gradually devastating secrets, acts of betrayal and heartache are revealed. This is a well written book full of empathy and reminds us all how tricky love is and how teenage daughters need loads of love and support in this arena. I can see this book being filmed as it is in the same genre as Gone Girl and the book would make a perfect gift for your daughters."}, {"userName": "Kindling Micky ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18967379-kindling-micky", "userReview": "The blurb and premise for this book really attracted me to it. The idea of a student/teacher situation decades on was an interesting concept. There's a thread of tragedy sliced with a little hope running right through this book but you dread an impending car crash situation.Jess was the seducer at 15 years old. Matthew was the weak, misguided and prosecuted maths teacher. Decades have passed, names have been changed and secrets are the name of the game. Clearly the context of this book makes for a tense but also a discomforting read. I felt my moral and ethical compass piqued and questioned by the black, white and grey of the issues narrated.When all was finished I had mixed feelings about the characters. Jess, years later is weak and people seem to walk over her, which was a departure from the Jess in adolescence. Clearly, she was marked by the events of the past. Matthew/Will was flaky, unrestrained in his emotions and willing to hurt those around him. I felt angry towards the older Will repeatedly.Overall, this book was an interesting read and a unique idea. There were periods where it felt a little slow but I was able to move ahead to more steadily paced sections.

It's an emotional rollercoaster and a fairly quick read for its size, about a major taboo subject - a romantic relationship between a student and teacher and the aftermath years later.This Secret We're Keeping is told both in the present from Jess's point of view (the student) and through a series of flashbacks in Will/Matthew's point of view (the teacher). I enjoyed both main characters and they felt real, although I didn't feel too attached to them. Probably because I've never been in their situation. I felt that they were both rather impulsive, in the current timeline and the flashbacks. And even though Will was a teacher, he was still quite young and in some ways still immature. He could relate quite well to his students. I did feel that Jess was slightly more mature for her age, which was probably a product of living with an alcoholic mum.As to the predictability of the story, I felt that This Secret We're Keeping was a bit of a mixed bag. Some parts I saw coming a mile off whereas other were so unexpected they practically gave me whiplash. There are so many secrets revolving around the relationship, both directly and indirectly.I was a tad confused during the final few chapters. I have an idea of what happened but it did jump around a bit. However, I have a very strong suspicion that this was just a formatting issue in the ARC I received and probably isn't in the finished version.I'm also not too sure how I feel about the ending. Yes, it is a happy(ish) and nice ending with nothing wrong with it at all, but it just didn't end the way I hoped it would so I was a tad disappointed.This Secret We're Keeping is a well done debut for Rebecca Done. The story and writing handles such a taboo subject so well and I would definitely recommend it to fans of contemporary.

Rebecca Done did a fabulous job of keeping to both. The dual time POV was a great way to parallel the characters' account of their relationship both past and present. The story is set in a small waterfront town in England. I'm always a sucker for an English backdrop and I absolutely love the British slang. The characters involved, Matthew (aka Will) and Jess were both very well written and developed into an equally matched storyline. Never did I want to put down the book or skim pages. The story never veered into the cheap and cheesy student/teacher relationship. It was definitely a story of intense blurred lines but viable and deep emotions and feelings. There was never a question of love rather if it was enough.The present tense story balanced out the forbidden secrets of the past story. I most enjoyed seeing the relationship evolve and regress. It changed but it didn't through the years that the story takes place. Rebecca Done did a beautiful job of taking this story beyond the 'dirty' relationship and made it more about the ripple effect of keeping secrets. Throughout the story I found myself constantly wavering on how the story would end. It most definitely ended how the story should have ended being dynamic, heartfelt, and sincere. This is one book that should definitely be on your TBR.D 4/5"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10325137-julie", "userReview": "I was spellbound by this book.

It\u2019s hard to believe that this is Rebecca Done\u2019s debut novel. This book was superbly written, the characters were extremely well developed, and the storyline moved at a lightning fast pace, giving it the distinct feel of the work of a seasoned author.This Secret We\u2019re Keeping is the story of a romantic relationship that develops between a twenty-five year old teacher and his fifteen year old student. As a fan of forbidden romance novels, I was immediately drawn to the synopsis. The book did push my moral boundaries. A ten year age difference between a couple is not a big deal, but when that age difference is between a fifteen year old and a person who is in a position of authority over her, it does sound some alarm bells. The book goes back and forth between the present day and the early 1990s when Jess and Matthew\u2019s relationship began. We get to see how Jess and Matthew are living their lives seventeen years after their affair ended, and how their relationship and his incarceration has changed them. The flashes back to the past were an important element in this book. It allowed me to witness the beginning of their relationship, right from their initial attraction to the start of their romantic involvement. It gave me a better insight into how it all happened, what Matthew\u2019s motives were, what their true feelings were. I found myself sitting on the fence, undecided about how I felt about their involvement, unsure of the true nature of it, but as I read further into the book, I was able to get a clearer picture and better understanding of their intentions.This Secret We\u2019re Keeping is a highly emotional, heartbreaking read that kept me glued to the pages. I was never able to just sit for a spell and read a couple of chapters. A couple of chapters quickly turned into a hundred pages. I never felt as though I was merely reading the words on the page, it felt like I was witnessing the story unfold firsthand. Rebecca Done has taken these characters and brought them to life. She has created them to be realistic, familiar, and sympathetic. As an avid reader, it\u2019s always a treat when you find a book that consumes you \u2013 a book that makes you wish that you had a \u2018do not disturb\u2019 sign hanging around your neck, a story that continues to play in your head even when you\u2019re not reading it. This Secret We\u2019re Keeping was that book for me. I was completely invested in Jess and Matthew\u2019s story, their family dynamics, friendships, and relationships. This book deals with a difficult topic for many readers, but Rebecca Done has handled it masterfully and honestly. It\u2019s not portrayed as an easy love story. It\u2019s raw and emotional. It was a roller coaster ride of feelings and heart pounding moments from beginning to end. Oh, and that ending! I am looking forward to reading more books by this talented author\u2026perhaps a sequel?"}, {"userName": "Lia Valenti", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69991080-lia-valenti", "userReview": "Una storia d'amore tormentata ma noiosa,noiosa e noiosa che nemmeno Danielle Steel !!"}, {"userName": "Vicky-Leigh Sayer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22088279-vicky-leigh-sayer", "userReview": "This secret we're keeping is a controversial novel covering the ultimate taboo subject; a pupil - teacher relationship.And what a brilliant novel it is!Jess Hart is a successful business woman with her own events catering company.

At just Fifteen to Matthew's Twenty Five, Jess is classed as a child in the eyes of the law, and the pair of them know that they would be in serious trouble if their affair should ever be discovered.But Jess is only a few months short of her Sixteenth birthday and the relationship is so mature and true that they believe they can make it through - if no one suspects them. Matthew Langley doesn't only have Jess' heart though, and a fellow teacher could be about to make trouble for them if she doesn't get her own way...Written in both present and past tense, from both Jess and Will/Matthew's view points, This Secret We're Keeping is a very different novel from anything that I have read for a while and I absolutely adored it.

As I carried on reading, I got even more intrigued - and then, by the time the 'secret' is revealed, I was really engaged and interested in the characters.Rebecca Done has done a really great job of creating characters you care about, but that are also flawed and realistic. They seem like real people, and that's why I really enjoyed this novel.It really made me think about what I'd do in both Jess and Matthew's positions - and their parents' and friends' too! I felt like Matthew and Jess made such a great couple but then sometimes had to remind myself that Matthew was breaking the law by having a sexual relationship with Jess, especially as a teacher in a position of authority and trust! It really makes you question things though as you can understand how happy they are together and it makes you wonder, was he really 'abusing' her? I wouldn't say so but according to the law he is, and if I didn't know the full story behind another couple in a similar position, I'd probably feel that the adult in that position was also a paedophile. It's a real minefield and it's certainly emotional at times.I really enjoyed this novel and would recommend it if you're looking for something to make you question your own values and make you think. It's ultimately a pretty easy read but I really enjoyed it, so that makes it a really good read in my book!* Many thanks to Penguin & Netgalley for providing a copy of this novel in return for an honest review. *"}, {"userName": "Jo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30242279-jo", "userReview": "Well, what a secret! A 15 year old student, Jess Hart, and her 25 year old maths teacher, Matthew Langley, embark on a secret affair. Make no mistake, the consequences should their relationship be discovered would be disastrous; Matthew's teaching career would be ruined forever, and he would face criminal prosecution and imprisonment as a paedophile. Yet still, Matthew, as the adult, gives in to Jess's advances, knowing full well he should know better. The 'devil's advocate' in what is straightforward in the eyes of the law, is that Jess is not presented as a naive and innocent victim of a predatory older male abusing his position of responsibility, quite the contrary, and she is just a few months short of 16 when their relationship will no longer be illegal. Yet Jess does come from a background of poor parental rolemodels, alcohol abuse and general emotional neglect suggesting that Matthew, as the teacher, should have been able to provide the boundaries and stability she lacked, and that she needed. Told from the perspectives of both Jess and Matthew/Will using time slots from both before and after discovery, I found this a very thought provoking and rather sad and tragic tale; a doomed love affair, or predatory grooming of the worst sort?There are other numerous secrets which all stem from this original event, all of them destructive and life-changing, as we witness the ripple effect down through the years.A very good, if at times a bit laboured, read which comes highly recommended!"}], "description": "A pupil and a teacher.

With so many secrets to keep hidden, how long can Jessica and Matthew avoid the dark mistakes of their past imploding in the present?
