I have sugar-coated my actual response to this book in an effort to \u2018keep the peace.\u2019 I just don\u2019t feel like I can leave my review as is because I\u2019m lying about this book. That being said, I am re-writing my review, again. I\u2019m going to stay true to my original feelings concerning this book. If that bothers anyone I\u2019m sorry. You are entitled to your opinion just as I am entitled to mine.That being said, I did not finish this book (stopped at 65%). I\u2019ll get to that later.Before the book even starts we get a \u201cbibliography\u201d of all the characters in the story. From the synopsis I was expecting maybe 3 main characters. The two guys and the girl they are looking for. Maybe one or two incidental characters along the way. Instead I get a list of 27 characters. I kind of skimmed past this, hoping it was just characters and not POVs. I was wrong. There are actually more than 27 names dropped into this book. There are people introduced for no purpose other than to tell us they committed suicide.This book\u2019s prologue starts out dark and gritty and interesting. I was actually curious and intrigued. I thought that maybe the book I picked out to be \u2018okay\u2019 might actually surprise me. There are a lot of descriptions and the writing truly sets the mood, even if I\u2019m completely confused by what is happening.Also the cover of the book drew me in. I was intrigued by the color scheme and the fact that there weren\u2019t words screaming at me on the cover.*There may or may not be spoilers to follow. You have been warned.*The book starts out with a group wandering through a deserted area. I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t completely confused by what was going on. There are abandoned cars and dead bodies and a group of girls who killed themselves presumably because Justin Bieber is dead.I was more or less invested at this point. The prose was descriptive and detailed. There were characters who had obviously gone through a lot and I wanted to know where they were going and how they were getting there and why on earth were there so many dead bodies and abandoned cars.Then I got to chapter one and all the intriguing prose was gone. I got a newspaper article about people who were dead or killed themselves or whatever. It was boring. I had no reason to connect to these people.When I finally do meet a character, Liam, I find out that he\u2019s leaving a cruise ship with a bunch of other people who apparently have no survival skills just because he\u2019s annoyed that their boat doesn\u2019t have any power. My initial reaction is what? Why would you leave a ship? My second reaction is why did the ship personnel let him (them) leave? Then I just gave up because it\u2019s fiction and I\u2019m supposed to suspend my logical thoughts. One of the girls who left the ship with Liam is Sabrina, from Jakarta, Indonesia, and she reminds us of that at least five more times.Let me show you the worst of the offenders.\u201cWhere are you from, Sabrina?\u201d\u201cJakarta, Indonesia.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dWhile he was in that position he looked back at the drifting liner\u2026\u2026\u201cWhere did you say you were from?\u201d\u201cJakarta.\u201dAllison gave that some thought then dropped the topic.\u2026He asked her where Jakarta actually was, and she explained that it was on the north coast of the island of Java.\u201cNear Australia,\u201d she said, seeing his blank expression.\u201cAh, I\u2019m with you now. Have you been on cruise liners long?\u201d\u201cNo, that was my first contract. My family are going to be so disappointed.\u201d\u201cNo, they don\u2019t. And if this is happening over there as well,\u201d He realized he shouldn\u2019t have said that. \u201cthey\u2019ll just want you to get home.\u201d\u201cThank you for watching out for me.\u201d-Okay, so to be fair, this actually had a bit of a purpose, but really, it\u2019s just filler.\u2026\u201cTell me about Jakarta.\u201dShe suddenly stopped walking, distressed. \u201cWe will be able to find where we left Julius?\u201d\u2026\u201cYoung lady,\u201d he said to Sabrina, \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d\u201cJakarta. Well, Depok, in Jakarta.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been there. In about 2005. Well, extraordinary to see you here.\u201d\u201cThank you for your hospitality.\u201dNext we get to meet Michael, who is a chauvinistic pig. He\u2019s in the States because his girlfriend is interviewing for an au pair position. Instead of sticking around for his girlfriend he takes off to Connecticut to have sex with some woman he met online. Michael also wants you to know he works out and has an erection when he wakes up. Michael also thinks that women should cook food for him and sleep with him. I have yet to see if he sees any other purpose for women. Michael also steals a bike.Next characters are Dave and Lulu Springsteen (who are American, and with a name like that how could they not be American?). They are the couple who are interviewing Charlie (Michael\u2019s girlfriend and Liam\u2019s sister). She\u2019s running late and Dave is upset. Lulu apparently likes Charlie\u2019s pure nineteen year old skin (this is invasion of the body-snatchers creepy). Then the power goes out.Next is Taylor Harrison (yes like the American President because she\u2019s also American). She works at a Country Club. She\u2019s convinced the owner (although we don\u2019t know he\u2019s the owner at the time) is a part of an organized crime ring because he\u2019s apparently overly polite and spends too much time at the Club compared to normal businessmen. Taylor is a vapid teenager who doesn\u2019t care that a bride\u2019s wedding day was completely ruined and that her boss is freaking out trying to keep everything together. She lists off a bunch on names of fellow co-workers, none of whom really matter aside from her friend Kacie. Taylor spends most of the book eating food and doing the simplest of chores, because she\u2019s still being paid but can\u2019t be bothered to actually do anything that resembles work.Another lazy loser is Steven Ziegler. He\u2019s a security guard at a hoity-toity housing community. He\u2019s more fascinated with his Kindle Fire HD than actually being a security guard. He\u2019s also the owner of a submachine gun. He\u2019s a real winner. His fingers are apparently too beefy for him to text and instead of helping people or trying to figure out why they power went out he just sits in his security booth puzzled. Until her breaks into someone\u2019s house because the power\u2019s out and they\u2019re not home. Eventually he teams up with a bunch of rich people and they have more or less a block party and eat lots of food.At some point Charlie has joined up with the Springsteens and Jonathan, who works for them or in their building, I don\u2019t know. Charlie introduces her obsession with One Direction, which is fine, it\u2019s the point of the book, I think. I guess. I don\u2019t even know.The story continues and Michael ends up stealing from a store and having his bike stolen. All I have to say is sweet karma I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t let me down. He also meets Molly and they steal bikes and then get run over by a horse and buggy. True story. Molly dies. Michael does not. I\u2019m upset about this.Liam and his group are apparently riding on the horse and cart that ran over Michael (if that\u2019s not true then that is what I was lead to believe, so whatever) and they are riding with two other men and two other women. We get this whole description of how Liam thinks they\u2019re couples and then they\u2019re not and then everyone from Latvia is insulted with this conversation between one of the Latvian men and Allison (the whiney Englishwoman traveling with Liam):\u201cYou English?\u201d asked the man.\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Allison responded in a condescending tone.\u201cI was in England last year.\u201d\u201cWere you really? Did you enter the country illegally?\u201dFor the first time, Liam was mildly amused by Allison Davies.\u201cSorry?\u201d asked the foreign man. \u201cI from Latvia. I in Lincolnshire, picking potatoes.\u201d\u201cFascinating,\u201d said Allison, with a nod to emphasise her sarcasm.-The conversation continues but I think it\u2019s clear that Allison has a bit of a problem with foreigners, which is funny considering she\u2019s a foreigner right now.We meet a few more characters and we only get to find out their nationality if it\u2019s something interesting, like Filipino. And apparently some girl named Danielle who can say she\u2019s four different nationalities. I guess I\u2019m confused by this because most people are not one specific nationality, especially in America, you know, the Melting Pot. And unless you go back multiple generations most people are actually from America. But, whatever, I\u2019m just arguing a pointless argument. But maybe it\u2019s important for us to know about Danielle\u2019s ethnicity because she\u2019s nearly raped. But she gets away, which, I\u2019m kind of surprised to hear, considering everything else concerning women in this book. And of course Danielle is obsessed with 1D as well and has the exact same tattoo as Harry. And stars annoy her.Liam\u2019s group gets to Boston, to find it more or less on fire, or completely charred, which really shouldn\u2019t be surprising. And they more or less ride right into gunfire. They basically have to run or die, so they run.Meanwhile the Country Club people are acting more like they\u2019re at summer camp. They\u2019ve been eating gourmet meals, playing softball and going on walks. Probably playing golf as well.Michael ends up killing someone who threatened him, even though he was the one trespassing. I can\u2019t blame him, it\u2019s a fight or flight response, what I can blame him for is trying to justify his actions and saying there was nothing else for him to do. And he steals her gun, which is actually a good idea, but ugh. I can\u2019t stand Michael.Liam\u2019s group decides to go camping, which is probably the smartest idea they\u2019ve had and of course the girls only carry one item because they\u2019re delicate or worthless or wimpy, I don\u2019t know. They stop for the night and Sabrina has a breakdown because she\u2019s scared and of course Liam\u2019s there to protect her. I seriously with they\u2019d just get together so we can\u2019t stop hearing about Liam\u2019s naughty thoughts and secret glances at Sabrina. Their group is confronted the next day and Julius dies. And Liam basically has this to say: \u2018She was his now and it was down to him to protect her.\u2019 While I get the idea I don\u2019t appreciate the fact that this girl is being treated as property. She doesn\u2019t belong to anyone. UGH.The Springsteens and Charlie arrive in Long Island at the mansion, which just happens to be where scuzzy security guard Ziegler is and they are reunited with their children. Yay. They meet other people in the \u2018enclave\u2019 and we find out that Mr. Ivanovic has more or less become dictator over the group.Then we go back to Michael and we get to meet all of his ex-girlfriends and we find out he\u2019s pretty much a man whore because he really doesn\u2019t tell us anything about any of these girls. He ends up meeting with the Army and they give him a ration pack and tell him good luck.Liam and co steal rations from a BMW showroom and then take a nap. And of course Sabrina sleeps with her head in Liam\u2019s lap. That probably gave him some more naughty thoughts.This is where I get confused. We are at the Country Club and Ferguson is giving a speech and Taylor blocks him out and all of the sudden we\u2019re talking about Lulu and Charlie and I have no idea how they are connected to the Country Club because they are all secluded in a house in their snobby neighborhood eating food cooked on an outdoor grill. And then we are completely enveloped in the world of the Springsteens and Charlie. WHAT???Then we get my feminist hackles up with an exchange between Ivanovic and Danielle. He more or less comes on to her, and actually kisses her, and she just stands there looking like an idiot. She slaps him after he said he expected to be slapped. Danielle justifies not slapping him at first because they\u2019re not living in normal times. Apparently when the power goes out it means women have no right. Great. Thanks. Then when Ivanovic says she doesn\u2019t have to hold back because of the way things are. NO. NO. NO.Liam and co find some guy on a boat who agrees to take them to New York but he decides to go rescue his wife first. They get mad, but before that Liam finally kisses Sabrina but he makes sure not to go too far because of her cultural beliefs. I\u2019m kind of shocked this is here, I\u2019m impressed actually. Then I\u2019m not impressed because Liam takes a running long jump over the boundaries.Then Michael ends up stealing a bunch of cell phones and shooting them in the forest, which is convenient because he\u2019s able to thwart an assassination on Ferguson\u2019s life and he gets roped into this bizarre Country Club life and I\u2019m seriously done with this book. I have no idea why I\u2019m still reading it. I\u2019m only 50% of the way through this book. I\u2019m just tired of all the convenient situations.I\u2019m seriously starting to question the common sense of people in this book. At one point a cruise is compared to the Titanic. We all know the Titanic sunk, right? So, why this: \u2018You could stand on the stern rail and imagine you were on the Titanic.\u2019There\u2019s also this: \u2018Sabrina was becoming more and more clingy towards Liam, something which he decided he quite liked.\u2019 Women do not need men to be complete. Women can be independent and strong.And this is where I lost all respect for this book and anything contained in this book. Charlie is talking to Mrs. Grainger, who used to be an author and she more or less attacks readers who dare to dislike her writing. Let me quote directly from the book. (I will be editing the swear words because my reviews are \u2018clean.\u2019)\u2018Charlie was surprised. \u201cYou wrote novels? Wow. What kind of novels?\u201d\u201cOh, erotica, dear.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYes. And here\u2019s another good thing to come out of all this \u2013 no more total a**holes posting one star reviews on my books. And some who moan at me and they haven\u2019t even finished the copy they were reading. I\u2019m so happy those f**kwits have thrown themselves off a bridge. I mean, if you don\u2019t like something, just forget it, just go away, go back to your f**king knitting, or something. Why do they feel the need to say \u201cit just didn\u2019t work for me\u201d? Really, please, who gives a sh*t for their dumb-a** opinion?\u201d-Well, let me answer that question for you, dear Mrs. Grainger. We rate books at one-star because they didn\u2019t hold up to their hype. When I see a book that has a 4.00 or higher rating on a review site I know that one of two things has happened, either the book is amazing or people aren\u2019t giving honest reviews, so I check out the book. I take a chance because I would hate to miss such an amazing literary masterpiece.I finish that book, or I don\u2019t because I don\u2019t enjoy it and then I go online and I tell people why the book didn\u2019t work for me, because it\u2019s my right as a reader to give my opinion, just as it\u2019s your right as an author to write what you want to write. I can appreciate the effort and time it took to write a novel, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to praise it up one side and down another. Especially when I was greatly offended by said book.As a reader I have a right to put down the book and say, \u2018nope, done\u2019 because I hate the book. This is called life. There is no way in the world that EVERY SINGLE LIVING HUMAN BEING is going to love your novel. It is not statistically possible. If, as an author, you can\u2019t handle that, maybe you, Mrs. Grainger, should stop writing for the world and go back to writing for your friends. And stop yelling at young girls who just wanted to know what you wrote. Goodness, you\u2019re an adult, you should grow up an act like one. Take a negative review as a learning experience and grow from it. It\u2019s called criticism and it\u2019s part of being an adult. So, you, dear Mrs. Grainger have caused me to put this book down at 65%. You were the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back so to speak.The Complete Lack of Concern for Human Life:Liam and Sabrina are talking about how they wish they had a time machine after making yet another pop culture reference to the movie The Time Machine and Sabrina thinks she wants to go back to see when President Kennedy was shot. Liam thinks that great, or to have been in New York during 9/11. Sabrina wants to take her dad to see D-Day. Liam thinks that\u2019s sweet. I think that\u2019s morbid. What is wrong with these two? Let\u2019s go back and relive some of the greatest tragedies in the last century. Awesome. Let\u2019s also go watch the Holocaust gas chamber murders or the Rwandan genocide. I mean, honestly, let\u2019s forget the fact that people died, it would be fascinating. Or, hey, forget that, Liam just wants to go back to the night he lost his virginity, so he could do it \u2018better\u2019 this time around.Then lets make a tasteless reference to 9/11 again. \u2018Liam, yawning but refreshed, felt he was experiencing what it must have been like to go through 9/11, unable to tell the time of day as the sunshine was blotted out, not by dust, but by smoke.\u2019-Really? Do you really think that was what people were thinking about? That the sun was blocked out with dust? I\u2019m pretty sure most of New York was living in fear that another plane might crash into the city. Or they might have even been worried about loved ones who were unaccounted for. Seriously, Liam, grow up.Racism:\u2018Danielle had tried to talk to the woman called Pam, but there was no real interest from her in making friends. The fact that the woman was black disturbed Danielle \u2013it was like there was a slave on the property.\u2019 NO. OH MY FREAKING GOODNESS NO.The Overwhelming Misogyny: \u201cI\u2019m Jane, sir.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, but before the world got screwed up. What\u2019s your full name? What brought you here?\u201d--All three females were dressed exactly like the waitresses from the day before, in white blouses, tied with a black belt and the sexy socks over the knees. (We apparently can\u2019t wash pants around the Country Club)--\u201cWill you be requiring company this evening, sir?\u201dHe looked at Taylor. \u201cSorry? What?\u201d\u201cCompany, sir. Female companionship.\u201dHe stared aghast at Taylor. (For the first time I have found respect for Michael.)--Buzzword Counts:Gun(s): 53(not counting the specific kinds of guns such as Uzi, submachine, etc.)Harry Styles: 21Dead: 27Kill: 16Power: 33I don\u2019t want to search for all the swearing in the book, but it was more than I care for. I understand that it\u2019s a way of life for some people but it just seemed like it was thrown in at times for shock appeal.The formatting of this book is whacky. You haveto get usedto reading sentences like this.And it makes no sense.Because then there will be full paragraphs written perfectly. It buggedme.A lot.The story was also littered with pop culture references that only seemed to be thrown in to either compare them to this story or to talk about some stupid point in the original context.I was extremely disappointed in this book, especially after reading the prologue, but I am so insulted by this book that I don\u2019t care how it ends.Thank you for your patience as I rambled a bit, but I just needed to get my true feelings out so I could stop feeling guilty about this review."}, {"userName": "Gloria Picchione Snodgrass", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12977480-gloria-picchione-snodgrass", "userReview": "Fun, Exciting and ScaryBy Zombie GloryaWant a story that has a scary plotline, exciting action and fun background?

So I thought what the heck, even though I probably would not have bought it normally.I actually really enjoyed it. More than I thought I would for sure, and it was a highly entertaining way to kill what would otherwise have been an extremely dull couple of hours.There are various characters scattered around the country after a sudden and unexplained mass power loss. NOTHING works. Not mobiles, not cars, not tablets not anything. You can't call the emergency services, you can't microwave your dinner and unless the person is standing right next to you communication is impossible. You COULD try standing on high ground and shouting loudly, but that is as likely to get you killed as anything else.So anyway, we meet a few people, follow them on their journey as they try and find each other, or loved ones, and it is sometimes funny, sometimes sad, often you will need to suspend disbelief and holding it all together at the core is One Direction. Not the band themselves that much, or the boy of the title who is much loved by girls everywhere, but more the idea of hero worship and obsession - not just of celebrities but of people you have in your life. There are some parts where I thought \"oh well THAT would never happen\" but this is after all, fiction. The writing is solid if not polished and the flow is good - I liked how the author explored how different personalities dealt with different situations, and it was pretty well constructed as we jumped between one group and another.I really liked the ending because I did what the characters did....completely ignored something major that had just happened then stopped and went \"erm hang on a minute...\"Overally then an enjoyable dependable read. Its not going to win any literary prizes, but I was engaged with the story, wanted to know the outcome and really wouldnt mind if the author continues with the tale. I'd like to know what happens next to our little group and I'd like to know more about the event itself - this story is about the consequences and as such was surprisingly addictive.Happy Reading Folks!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7087508-jennifer", "userReview": "This kind of story is usually \"my thing\". I love a good Apocalypse. I wanted this book to be more than it was. There were some good parts, most definitely. My main issue was the characters themselves. Maybe if I was a teen or twenty something they might have made perfect sense to me. But having gone beyond 40, the fact that all the characters we deliberately written to be young,hot, and really into sex bothered me. I even asked myself, was I like this once? Young , hot, and really into sex? I told myself YES. Yes I was and if I was a teen or twenty something this book would have made perfect sense. I would not have noticed the glaring plot holes, or that society completely fell apart in a 24 hour time period. And I could have focused more on Michael's morning \"wood\". Yes folks, I mentioned \"good parts\" above (no pun intended). I got a good chuckle. There were several of those moments.

It was an interesting take on an \"end of the world as we know it scenario\" and some of the characters were pretty interesting.The negative, the author killed off the interesting ones. I'm going to explain the thought process behind the stars, or lack thereof, that I have granted to this book. To me, every book starts off at five stars and stars or percentages of them are removed as the book goes in ways in which I do not agree.The first star was deducted because the author was unable to write Americans as convincing at all. The Americans all had British vernacular when speaking, thinking, etc. It drew me out of the story. Also, not every single person in America has a gun, especially not Uzis or other machine gun style weapons. The characters were in the NJ/NY/Boston area and the gun laws in those areas are rather strict and severe, so having a lot of guns and/or ammo for said weaponry is not overly easy to come by. Also, I HIGHLY doubt that after two hours of loss of power that a cabbie would try to rape his fare and that after only a day and a half without electricity that people would be committing suicide and freaking out and shooting first, looting the bodies later. Yes, this is a particular imagining of how society would look after a \"end of the world\" type of event, however I would like to think that people would be a bit more civilized then that.Second star deducted for the following quote, of an older lady in the book who was a writer. I copied and pasted this from another reviewer's review, but it is how it appeared in the book I read. \u2018Charlie was surprised. \u201cYou wrote novels? Wow. What kind of novels?\u201d\u201cOh, erotica, dear.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYes. And here\u2019s another good thing to come out of all this \u2013 no more total a**holes posting one star reviews on my books. And some who moan at me and they haven\u2019t even finished the copy they were reading. I\u2019m so happy those f**kwits have thrown themselves off a bridge.

Really, please, who gives a sh*t for their dumb-a** opinion?\u201dThat is just insulting to the reader. Actually, this is going to remove two stars from my possible total of five. That's how much this quote irritates me. Especially since I received this book with the express purpose to read and review, regardless of my opinion, positive or negative. The fourth star was removed due to the raging anti-female sentiments that came across to me in this book. Women were either madonnas or crazy-b*tches that were crazy because of men. Women were property and to be protected. They couldn't take care of themselves. Sabrina at the end actually shot and killed someone who was threatening her group and after she did so, her boyfriend (who earlier that day kissed her awake and then ripped her shirt open and demanded she wake up his sister. Her reaction was shock and happiness) took the gun from her and led her passively to the wagon they were traveling on. She went meekly along. This is just one example among many of where the men were \"taking care of\"the women folk and they were cooking and cleaning for the men. Not cool. I can take care of myself and I'm sure most women in America (as that is where this takes place) can do so as well. Yes, some of the women were not from America, but even the ones who were only used sarcasm and eye rolling to make their thoughts known. They didn't fight or stand up for themselves.The ending was also GARBAGE. SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!You are telling me that the electricity comes back and the FIRST thing the survivors notice is a TRAIN crossing sign flashing and a TRAIN traveling??!?! Really??!? There wouldn't be SCADS of military vehicles and planes and stuff moving around, ESPECIALLY around NYC trying to gain control of the people who went nuts without power for like a week (ok, ok, maybe a month, time passing wasn't very clear) that the powers that be would be focusing on getting the TRAINS up and running again? And I'm sorry, but after like a month or so without power and maintenance, how the HELL were trains able to work without some MAJOR maintenance?And another complaint, WAAAY too many characters. It was hard to keep them straight, the cool ones were introduced and then killed off and I got Charlie and Danielle confused in that I THOUGHT Charlie was the sister of Ian and the girlfriend of the scummy Michael, but apparently it was Danielle, who was hardly focused on AT ALL. Seriously, until Charlie said her BF was in England, I thought Michael was into HER. Then I was like, ok, his GF is someone else, but WHO? I completely forgot all about Danielle, as she had like five pages of time. Also confusing was the two Long Island gated communities. Couldn't have come up with a community in like NJ and one in Long Island to keep the readers from getting so confused? The book was unclear with both characters and locations. It was over the top less than positive towards women and it had some rather pointed hatred towards readers who had opinions contrary to the author's about how great his book was. I would not recommend this book to anyone, which is sad. I really wanted to like this book and was in the mood for an \"end of the world as we know it\" book and this one didn't deliver.

Even if, the book did seem to end a little too abruptly. At its conclusion, I did fight my e-reader for a few minutes, trying to convince it to turn to the next page when apparently there wasn\u2019t one. This book reminded me of Hollowland by Amanda Hocking, without the zombies. California, by Edan Lepucki, without all of the strained psychological undercurrents. There were plot holes that some people might fume about and there was an odd mix up with the characters\u2019 names at one point that left me slightly confused, but I don\u2019t think any of that is truly important in a book like this. Yes, we could spend our whole lives dissecting and obliterating every book we read, but I don\u2019t want to. This book is exactly what the title and description promises. An end of the world, post-apocalyptic tale that is meant to entertain and I think it does just that. The Harry Styles element is weak throughout, which leads me to believe the writer was more interested in using Harry Styles as a symbol for our reliance on modern technology, electricity, and our overwhelming need to worship celebrities. Without these things, many people in the book flounder, some even going so far as to off themselves rather than face the horrors of a life without convenience, Justin Bieber, and online friends. One of my favorite moments in the book comes from a cranky, if not likeable, older woman who writes erotic fiction. She states this about life after the cataclysmic blackout, \u201cYes. And here\u2019s another good thing to come out of all this \u2013no more total a$$holes posting one star reviews on my books.\u201d So there\u2019s that.

However, it definitely surpassed my expectations! The writing style and writing ability of the author are excellent. I really felt like the accuracy of GB Hope's vision of the Apocalypse was spot on. People die, as they would. Even people we were just getting to know but really liked. And it really effected the other characters, which is something usually missing from these types of books. I love that! On the downside, being American, I did notice a number of British errors: I accept that curb is kerb and a flashlight is a torch, but no one in New York would be likely to have an MRE containing curry, oat biscuits and tea. Our MREs in America have Pop Tarts, riblets and coffee or similar. No business owners or bosses would insist on a constitutional walk--Americans are lazy!"}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4147147-christina", "userReview": "Today's review is a very serious one for me, and I'm sure you can understand that I have a lot to say upon seeing my first-ever one star rating. I received Finding Harry Styles for review, and I requested it on NetGalley because the title drew me in with it's fun nature. I expected this book to be a fan fiction about finding Harry Styles in New York City. Instead, I got a post-apocalyptic novel in which there is a worldwide blackout. Harry Styles plays no role in the book whatsoever, except that a few characters are One Direction fans. Don't be fooled by the title.My main concerns with this novel are with the chauvinistic undertones. Women are treated extremely poorly throughout the entirety of the book, and are portrayed as weak, submissive creatures who must be protected and controlled by the men at all times. This really disturbed me, and I honestly couldn't believe that women were written in this manner. To illustrate my point, I would like to share a few scenes in the book that really stuck out to me. In one scene, a murder has just taken place, and a female character is crying. The man she's with doesn't approve of this behavior, so he slaps her across the face to shut her up. This unnecessary violence and abuse really shocked me. In the same way, the author writes a scene in which a man kisses a woman without her permission, then tells her she can slap him if she wishes because he knew it was wrong. She slaps him, and as the chapter closes, readers learn that the man let the woman slap him because he knew she would not be strong enough to cause him any pain.This chauvinistic writing is not appropriate, and I could not believe how present it was throughout the book. Similarly, the author does not talk highly of race or diversity, and even includes a racial slur in the book. Again, I was shocked and upset with this choice of writing. The last reason I felt truly compelled to give this book a one star rating was the treatment of suicide. In Finding Harry Styles, characters begin killing themselves after just a few days of the power being out. This continued every so often throughout the novel, and it was upsetting that the author chose to include these deaths in the story. Suicide is a very serious issue, and when young people in the book are killing themselves just because they can't use their cell phones anymore, that marginalizes an issue that should instead be talked about in a respectful manner. Thus, with the poor treatment of women, race, and suicide, I have no choice but to give this book the lowest rating. I cannot recommend this book to anyone because of this content. Moreover, even if I put all of those issues aside, I would still rate Finding Harry Styles with a low star count due to the writing style. This novel is replete with characters, and the point of view changes often to follow these different characters. I found it extremely difficult to differentiate between characters, especially because new characters were introduced in nearly every chapter, but then dropped off shortly thereafter. If the author wished to include so many characters in Finding Harry Styles, it would have been helpful to label each chapter with a character name so the reader can distinguish between them easier. In addition, the pacing of the novel was very slow and unbalanced. At the beginning of the book, the characters switched up quite regularly, but later in the novel we focus on certain characters for a long period of time. When the writing switches back to other characters, it was disorienting because it had been so long since we heard of them last. In the same way, there was no clear goal for the characters in this book. I spent the novel wondering what was going to happen, because it seemed the characters were just wandering around the East Coast trying to stay alive. As the book ended, I felt there was no point to the story whatsoever, and I just witnessed a lot of violence for no reason. Of course, no reader wants to feel this way. Finally, the writing overall was not executed well. There was a lot of telling, and not a lot of showing, so I never had a clear vision of the characters or setting. I would have preferred less straightforward writing, as it detracted from the reading experience when I was told flat-out every action. The author also mis-quotes a very popular movie, which did not affect the plot at all, but definitely detracted from the author's credibility. In the same way, the author includes a scene in which a character is an author, and speaks very poorly of people who leave her one star reviews. It's almost as if this author is now challenging the reader to give him a bad review. I found that extremely unprofessional.In the end, I am glad I completed Finding Harry Styles so I could share my thoughts on this novel and warn others of its contents. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book to anyone, and I would not pick up any other works from this author in the future."}, {"userName": "Lynda Dickson", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7863634-lynda-dickson", "userReview": "After an unexplained event takes out all electricity, communications, and transportation in the US - and possibly the rest of the world - we follow two men searching for the same girl: Michael Clavell is in Connecticut and is trying to find his way to his girlfriend in New York; and Liam McCalister disembarks from a cruise ship in Massachusetts and tries to find his sister. During their travels, Michael and Liam encounter extreme violence, but also great gestures of kindness, friendship, and even love. Throughout the course of the book, we are introduced to an enormous cast of characters - too many to keep track of even with the list at the beginning. Most of the female characters are not portrayed in a very attractive light. However, most of the male characters are not to be admired either, being violent and/or sexually depraved. A couple of ruthless men take advantage of the situation and set themselves up as leaders, forming their own communities with hierarchies and rules, mostly for their own advantage. This book provides a surreal glimpse into what lengths some people will go to in order to survive, and what trivialities other people will cling to in the face of doom. While this book deals with a lot of serious issues, it maintains a mostly ironic and slightly humorous tone. Overall, I felt that most situations were resolved too easily.

Not your typical \"post-apocalyptic\" book in that there are no zombies. No viruses. Just a complete loss of electricity, as well as to vehicles and most other items that we all probably rely on way too much.One thing that I always find interesting in these stories are the reactions of people and how groups form. Who becomes a true leader, and who becomes a dictator. You see several groups form in this story, and each one is fascinating in its own way - some are even scary.The title maybe off putting for some; really it just relates to a couple of the characters and their love of One Direction and Harry Styles.Honestly, the book entertained me, and I couldn't put it down.Maybe the women could have been stronger. Maybe some of the men not so bossy. The only thing that really bothered me was the one comment made about online reviewers saying \"It just wasn't my thing\". I do use that line because not everything I dislike is going to be disliked by others. I say it because I don't want anyone - other readers or authors - to think I'm judging them based on something I didn't enjoy and that they did.At any rate, I did enjoy this book.
