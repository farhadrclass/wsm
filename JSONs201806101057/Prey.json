There are pages and pages of the bear's thoughts. Oh, and he's a killer bear. Even better. Nobody wants to read pages and pages of a sweet and cuddly bear's thoughts. That would be boring!Bear thoughts are strangely existential...So, killer bear is out to eat people. That's his thing. He wants to eat our h & H, Angie and Dare. Frankly, I want him to eat the author for naming her character Dare.I couldn't resist, she triple-dog-Dared me!Angie and Dare are both mountain guides in Montana and have competing businesses. Dare's is winning because who would book a mountain trip with someone named Angie over someone named Dare?A trip with Angie:A trip with Dare:Why yes, there is a bear included in both trips, but one has a bit more pizzazz than the other. Sure, you end up dead - eaten by a bear - in both scenarios, but you'll have more FUN before being eaten with Dare's group.Bear don't even care. It's a flesh wound. He'll walk it off while he's digesting you.This book bored the crap out of me. I hate camping and the outdoors has too many bugs for me, so I should have known...The only good part was the bear killings. I would have been a fan of the bear except that he was gross and smelly.

I loved this book! Admittedly, it didn't quite reach the five star mark for me but that is really an oddly elusive thing lately, and books that get five stars from me get it for no reason that I can really explain...they just have a little extra wow. One of my favorite Howard books is Up Close and Dangerous...there's something I love about a couple forced to be in close proximity to each other by some accident of fate that makes them rely on each other for survival in the wild. Maybe because it strips them of their inhibitions and it boils all the details down to nothing. They are each who they were meant to be, without the influence of the world, without anything to worry about other than survival and each other. They struggle to meet basic needs, and when it all comes down to it, our physical and mental well being as humans really comes down to a few things.FoodWaterShelterCompanionshipIf we have these things, not only are we safe and healthy, but happy too. I liked how in this book, these MC's started off having legitimate reasons to dislike each other. Well, for the most part. Angie started out feeling flustered and googly eyed over Dare but that spark quickly fizzled when she realized that he was siphoning off her business until she was nearly bankrupt. Dare, on the other hand, is infatuated with her \"World Class Ass\" and can't understand where her animosity comes from. So a man eating black bear and a stone cold sociopathic murderer bring these two together...swoon! A love story for the ages, lol....Dare gets to play hero, but he wasn't so much a chauvinist that he has no faith in Angie's abilities...even when she's injured, he doesn't chalk her predicament up to womanly inexperience or incompetence. He simply swoops in, saves the day, and takes care of the girl until she is able to do so for herself. He was quite the complex guy, although Howard didn't really delve into his psyche all that much.Angie has a tiny bit of little man syndrome...what woman in her right mind would take two strange men up into the mountains on a week long hunting trip? I'm not really sure I care just how competent I think I am...facts are facts, and generally, men are stronger than women. That's quite the trust you're putting in strangers.This love story doesn't get romantic for quite some time but the slower pace was quite nice...the story was interesting enough by itself, and the hot sex and slow, timid chemistry creeped nicely along until the time felt right.I listened to the audiobook an the narrator did a great job...no overacting, she sounded like a young woman but not too young, inflection was great, and I'm hoping she does some more narrating, as I can't find any more books read by her."}, {"userName": "Norma", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1913550-norma", "userReview": "*Sigh* How horribly disappointing. This book was flat-out boring. There were actually chapters upon chapters written from a bear's point of view! A bear! Remember Up Close and Personal, where we learned everything we'd ever need to know if we crashed our plane into a mountain? Yeah, well here we learn about bears and camping. I'll give LH props for her research. The woman is an expert on so many things! However, in the end, I had to struggle to finish this. At one point I said to my husband, \"Just give me an hour or so, I just *have* to finish this awful book!\" Of course he thought I was crazy and still did even after I explained that this was a beloved author and that I wouldn't DNF her.On the positive side, I did like Dare. He reminded me a little of Sam Donovan and a very little of Wolf MacKenzie. He was grumpy and gruff. He had no filter and just said what he thought. He also never fought his feelings. He liked Angie and then loved her. He accepted it and set out to make her feel the same way. I liked Angie for the first part of the book because she was independent and strong like so many other LH heroines. However, after a while she was just annoying.Over all, I wouldn't even recommend this to the most die-hard of LH fans. :("}, {"userName": "Preeti \u2665\ufe0e (Romance She Reads)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32506772-preeti-romance-she-reads", "userReview": "Take rival adventure guides h/H, murderous clients, feral bears, dangerous storms, a run for their lives, enforced seclusion in a mountain cabin and you get the gist of this typical Linda Howard romantic thriller set up in the Montana Rockies. This is her third survival-up-a-snowy-mountain that I\u2019ve read. This book had too much narrative in the first half, although I enjoyed the first couple of chapters where we get the H's pov and get to know her as a person but then it got somewhat tedious till the part where all hell breaks loose.The H is an ill tempered foul mouthed grumpy ex military guy who comes back to their home town and unwittingly draws away most of the h\u2019s clients. So the fiercely independent h has hated his guts these past 2 years and this enmity (from her side) is at its peak, when she realizes that she has no other resort but to sell her failing business and go back to Billings. But for this last bookings by an old client who is bringing another guy interested in hunting down a bear. An old family friend feels uneasy that she would be alone with two unknown males up in the mountains and requests a very reluctant H to look out for her. It all snowballs into a dangerous run for their lives as new and unknown threats get revealed. But these two manage to steal two alone days in an isolated cabin during a brutal storm to finally give in to their fierce attraction to each other and acknowledge that hate is just another side of the love coin. The H is immensely likable in a grumpy sexy way and the h is admirable for her strong independence and grit. As for her story about her failed wedding/marriage is concerned, it was so ridiculous that it was completely believable and relatable. I totally got how this non-girly h would have felt so strongly about the messing up of her makeup and hair on her wedding day. And the ex definitely behaved in an asininely immature way! Why would people only see the funny side and not get her pov on the kiddish humiliation and also the betrayal of a promise.Two relatable quotes from the book . . . \u201cSome people instinctively knew the right thing to say, the right thing to do, but she wasn\u2019t one of them. The best she could do was, well, the best she could do, and hope she didn\u2019t screw up too much.\u201d\u201cThat was the best thing about female friends: the instant, unquestioning support, regardless of common sense or practicality.\u201dAnd not to forget the H\u2019s contribution . . .\u201cFucking nipples on ice! \u201d and \u201cFuck, shit, yeah!\u201d"}, {"userName": "Joan Reeves", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5232286-joan-reeves", "userReview": "Murder, Conflict, Sexual FireworksI was rather surprised by the overly harsh reviews I've read on Prey. I'll admit to being a diehard Linda Howard fan so I ignored the reviews and bought the book anyway. After all, as an author, I get bad reviews too, and I like to think that readers are discerning enough to wade through bad reviews if a book's blurb sounds like their kind of book.I liked Prey. In fact, I stayed up way too late to finish it the other night. Nobody does heroes better than Linda Howard. She writes the kind of man you'd recognize instantly if you met him on the street--that's how real her characters are. The heroines are always likable and are the kind of women I'd enjoy having as friends.Enter Dare and Angie--two people made for each other if Angie only knew it. Dare does. He's a walking, talking simmering cauldron of longing when it comes to Angie, and he hates the fact that he can't get her out of his mind. Dare was a soldier too long to attempt \"polite\" speech so his language is peppered with profanities--just like every soldier I've ever known. What a finely drawn character.Throw in a murder plot, a survival against the cruel Montana weather, and sexual fireworks that go off like the 4th of July, and you've got Prey by Linda Howard.Go for it!

I started reading her as a romance author, and stuck with her into the romantic suspense territory, even though I prefer books more centered on human relationships and emotions than action and mysteries. Even with bad guys present, she could describe a bit about his background to make him if not someone I'd like to be around, at least someone I can relate to on some level. But a couple of chapters into this book, the viewpoint switches to that of a killer man-eating bear. Seriously. To which, I throw up my hands and say I can't relate to that. That is just that one step farther from the romance genre I started reading Howard for to make me stop reading the book and pick up something else. I stopped on page 27. I will probably finish it at some point, I mean the two hot guides have to get together for some steamy sex and eventually marriage at some point, right? But not today. After chugging through 53 of her books, I find it fascinating on one level to know that a bear is my stopping point....three months later, I picked up the book and finished it, and ended up really liking it. I'd been reading historicals for the last 2-3 months, so a contemporary was like a breath of fresh air at that point. Also, the bear is barely (ha!) in the rest of the book, and the two guides are indeed hot. I really enjoyed the progression of their relationship, how blunt their personalities were. I do like my male protagonists grumpy, so Dare fit the bill well there. I couldn't give it four stars due to the bear thing, but Angie & Dare's snarky conversations easily brought the overall rating up to a solid 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3457572-kristin", "userReview": "I'm just continually bummed by Linda Howard these days. In the past she's been so brilliant, but things are hit and miss these days (as I have said many times recently). This book had a FABULOUS concept and the execution wasn't bad. She worked it out so that the scenario seemed plausible, and that was good. She also had characters that were just unique enough to make the story work. (Outdoorsy girl, abandoned by mother, raised by father, bad first wedding, not a quitter. Military man with shrapnel wound to throat and therefore hoarse voice, has a love of cussing, reads books, really grouchy but has a wry sense of humor and a bit of tenderness on the inside.) I liked them. I liked the concept. (Well, except poking around online makes it seem like black bears are the least likely to be maneaters, but I'm willing to suspend disbelief on that point.)My biggest complaint was how unsuspenseful the whole thing was. I knew the rough plot from the inside cover, and that's about all that happened. There was no build up to the climactic showdown, no running for their lives, no terror. Just a couple of people holed up staying out of the rain, taking FOREVER to finally have sex. (Let's be honest here. In reality, the sex may or may not happen. In a Linda Howard novel, it should happen a lot sooner.) I guess it's good that the reader has something to wonder about, because it's easy to forget about both the maneating bear and the homicidal client for a majority of this very slow moving story. I almost hate to shelve this with suspense. I still love Linda Howard, I like her ideas and her characters and her writing, but the execution just seems to be lacking again."}, {"userName": "Anne OK", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/285610-anne-ok", "userReview": "Nothing like I expected from an author of Linda Howard's caliber.

It was more an action survival book than anything else. The heroine had guts and then some. She had moral fiber to know when to sell out her property and business and she was super tough crawling down a mountain in a storm with a broken ankle to get away from a murderer and a maneating bear.I enjoyed the interlude with her and the super hot hero. I loved the way he was written, rough around the edges and with a potty mouth. I loved how he took care of her. Maybe we could have know a little more about him but I felt like we knew enough.The bad guy was realistic. I always appreciate when an author chooses to use something other than a terrorist or a serial killer as a bad guy. And the bear... well let me just say that even though I live in Missouri where black bears are only now making a comeback and moving north, I am scared sh**less of bears. I think I read too many \"Drama in Real Life!\" stories in the Reader's Digest over the years. So it didn't take much to convince me that the bear was the bigger evil. The writing was fast pace and absorbing as usual with Ms. Howard. She paints extremely clear word pictures and her stories are always alive in the reader's head. The only thing that was not totally in active voice was the epilogue which seemed almost as if a narrator was telling us \"and so gentle reader, our story draws gently to a close....\" Minor quibble, that.If the bear POV put you off, I say go back and give it another try.

Good thing he does, because of course Chad does shoot and kill Mitchell, and needs to also kill Angie, the only witness. However, Angie is saved by the interference of a vicious black bear that tears the dead body of Mitchell to shreds! She escapes into the stormy wilderness, where Dare eventually finds her, bringing her to the safety of his cabin. They spend the remainder of the novel getting romantic, until Linda Howard remembers that there's both a human killer and an animal killer out there, and quickly brings them all back together for a final battle.Phew. What a stinker! While the three sequences (three, in a 3oo plus page novel) involving the bear delivered the goods, they certainly weren't enough to save the rest of this snorefest! You should probably read the first 150 pages and then the last 30, because everything in between that is a complete bore. It's long, long, long drawn-out descriptions of Chad fumbling through the wilderness, or of Angie and Dare sleeping, drinking coffee, going to the toilet etc. It was a chore to get through. I'd rather climb a mountain! Well, actually, no I wouldn't, but this book certainly made me feel like I was trawling through the mud!The book's biggest sin is a sequence in which Dare, after snuggling with Angie overnight so they can both stay warm, makes a comment about morning erections and how they're unavoidable. Angie makes a sarcastic comment about its size in return. So Dare grabs her hand and puts it on his erection.I nearly threw the book at the wall in shock, outrage and distaste. The only thing that stopped me was the fact it was a library book!How utterly disgusting, revolting and piggish (and several other adjectives). I knew then, no matter how could the book might turn out to be (and I had already suspected it wouldn't get any better), it was an automatic 1 star!Maybe if they were already in a relationship, or had even shared a kiss, and he had given some prior indication he would do this, it might be acceptable. Maybe. But as a response to her making a jibe about the size of his penis? Nope, nope, nope. Would Dare do the same to a man if a man had made a similar comment? I doubt it. Dare is a disgusting pig and I hated him from that point on. That pages later Angie is thinking of him as a gentleman because he let her get changed without spying on her just made me feel in.I can't believe a woman wrote this disgusting garbage!On top of this, it's just loaded with non-sensical silliness:If Chad wants to kill somebody, why is he going into the fucking wilderness to do it, without some sort of prior recon to get a lay of the land? And why during encroaching bad weather conditions, knowing how unpredictable nature can be? The whole book's set-up is based on its villain being a complete idiot!Angie is still shamed by her first marriage, which she annulled, because her groom stuffed wedding cake into her face when she asked him not to.Oh yeah, and Dare is a gross, disgusting, juvenile pig!But the few brief sequences with the black bear were good.

I waver between 3 and 4 stars. Abby Craden's narration  is quite good for Angie, but her voice for the hero (Dare) is a bit too gravely, strained, and rough (she does this on purpose because he had a throat injury). As for how the audio story flows, the first 8 chapters are slow, with too much time devoted to Angie's thoughts, and few scenes with Dare. The action on the stormy ice-cold mountain with a man-eating bear and a ruthless killer begins at chapter 9. Even so, it's sometimes slow, with boring sections describing Angie's thoughts, about how to escape and survive. I liked reading those scenes, but on audio, the pace felt too slow. However, the pace picked up when Dare finally entered the picture for good, at the end of chapter 10.So... 3 stars for audio version, but 3.75 for text.Review of the text only: Horrifyingly gruesome at times, this is an absorbing, suspenseful, and detailed survival story with strong themes of tenacity, trust, and passionate unyielding commitment. Dare and Angie get my vote for most likely to succeed at ... anything and everything!I liked this book better the second time around (but this time I totally skipped over the really gory scenes and the 5 pages with the bear's point of view -- what was LH thinking!?).The first time I read it, the horror and survival aspects overwhelmed the romance and relationship, so I rated it 3 stars. However, on this second read, I concentrated on Dare and Angie, and felt like I really got to know the characters -- and more importantly, they began to bond with each other. A trusting, devoted relationship developed nicely, even though the entire book -- except for the epilogue -- takes place in about 48 hours. Ummm, well, actually...Dare has had his eye on Angie for the past two years. In fact, he's \"had his eyes on her world-class ass\" since the first time they met. But she wanted nothing to do with the guy who was \"stealing customers\" from under her nose. As you might guess, the course of true love (yada yada yada).Now, two years later, Dare goes up the mountain to keep covert watch over his hostile love, who is leading a hunting expedition with two men. Good thing, too.I'll probably never forget that scene in the dark, when Dare is desperately trying to find Angie, who is cowering in the icy rain, ankle on fire, body layered in mud, hiding from monsters with two feet and four. All his protective instinct kick into high gear.Dare -- former army -- is alpha all the way, so he rescues her, but Angie does her part, too -- she's not a quitter and stubborn to the core, despite suffering pain, fatigue, shock, and borderline hypothermia. Beating the odds is soooo not easy for these guys! Lots of intense survivalist stuff goes on for many pages, but I liked that. So many of these modern romantic suspense books make the big rescue look like a piece of cake. (or not...Angie's worst nightmare features a piece of wedding cake, so maybe not the best metaphor). Once the immediate danger is alleviated, they recuperate for a while. In between rest periods, Dare FINALLY gets his girl to look at him, talk to him!! So...lots of lovely relation-shipping (J) is packed into two cloistered days in a cabin, leading to a fabulously passionate love scene. There is also plenty of sexual banter. I chuckled several times.But...the danger is still there, and they gotta get off that mountain.In the epilogue, they get married (of course) and celebrate with a \"big-ass wedding cake\" (you'll see, the white icing is important).Note: The man-eating bear is really nasty. The stench. Then, we get to hear his POV for about 5 pages or so. Ick.(Adult content: explicit sex, several truly gruesome deaths, lots of F-bombs and such, minimal profanity.)"}, {"userName": "Nurhayat Turna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34869698-nurhayat-turna", "userReview": "Linda Howard favori yazarlar\u0131mdan biridir benim. \u00c7\u0131km\u0131\u015f olan kitaplar\u0131n, bulabildi\u011fim kadar\u0131n\u0131 alm\u0131\u015f tek tek okumu\u015f, hatta defalarca da okuyacak kadar \u00e7ok sevmi\u015fimdir.
