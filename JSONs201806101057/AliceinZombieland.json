I liked Alice in Wonderland as a child, and I wasn't too sure I wanted to see what changes would be made to this classic story. I was curious though after reading some Austen remakes that are being retold the same way. So I fell through the rabbit hole and began the journey with Alice.After only a few pages of the book, I knew this was going to be hard to get through. The writing wasn't favorable in the fact that it had a ton of run on sentences that began to be annoying. I kept wanting to grab a pencil and start editing. While it followed the story of the classic at times, some of it became horrendous. I actually rolled my eyes in several parts and put it down during some of it to take a break. I had to force myself to finish this book.Some stories should be left to the original version. In this case, I want to throw this book in the hole and not welcome it back. If you are a fan of fairy tale's being retold, and don't mind the darker side of it, I would recommend borrowing this book from the library first before purchasing it. You might find yourself wishing to save your money for a different fairy tale remake."}, {"userName": "Meghan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5234013-meghan", "userReview": "I loved Alice in Wonderland and was pretty stoked to finally be able to find this. I was not, however, much encouraged to finish :( I slogged through it and after a promising and pretty cute beginning, it just got pretty boring. It honestly just felt like the \"co-author\" cut and paste certain sections of the original and then added his own zombie bits to them that made the entire story just awkward, hard to read and thoroughly un-entertaining, at least for me. What writing he did do was stilted and didn't mesh well with the original flow of the story, and honestly, everything had that tacked on feel like the author wanted to do something great but couldn't pull it off and just kind of half-assed it instead. I'm all for a good zombie romp (Seth Graham-Smith did it pretty well!), but this was just a painful and altogether terrible mash up of a great classic and someone's get rich quick scheme to cash out what Pride, Prejudice and Zombies started. I really wanted to like this book after the beginning, but I forced myself to read it because damn it, I was halfway through and I finish books that I start!

It depends on your sensibilities and expectations. First of all, this is a humor book. The reader is asked to lighten up and go along for the ride. To have fun and not to dwell too heavily on the fact that there is little originality to the story except for the characterizations and some of the settings. As some reviewers have noted, and criticized Cook for, is the sense that he did not make this work his own as much as Seth Grahame-Smith did with Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. It\u2019s obvious from the beginning that he took Carroll\u2019s work and merely altered it. Either he did not feel the need to reinvent, or this is a slapped out, bandwagon jumping effort to take advantage of the success of the types of books I listed above. Even the publisher acknowledges this in an offhand way: \u201cA fresh and hilarious new zombie mash-up, bringing the hottest format on the humor shelf to a beloved classic, complete with zombie-fied updates to the renowned illustrations by Sir John Tenniel. Sure to be a major hit with humor, Alice and zombie enthusiasts everywhere!\u201d Uh, I\u2019m not sure about that last part. Yes, people who spend time in the humor section of the bookstore will like this book. Zombie enthusiasts should like the tack Cook takes with the story. But diehard Alice fans? I\u2019m not so sure. From what I\u2019ve seen around the web, not all were thrilled with Cook\u2019s efforts. I made it easy on myself and just read expecting nothing more than to have a giggle at Alice\u2019s adventures through a dark and disturbing world. It was a fun read, but challenging at times. The review copy I received was very raw. The errors in this unfinished product got to me, especially toward the end of the book. This however is the nature of the beast when dealing with an uncorrected proof. So I cannot fault the writer or the story heavily for things that should be fixed by the time this review is published. If you are expecting something along the lines of what Grahame-Smith as done, forget it. Not even close. If you are expecting a light, fun, humorous and horrifying read (especially the last chapter as it gets gory) \u2013 you will like this. I do have a problem recommending it, because when it comes to humor, you can\u2019t please all the people all the time. What tickles my funny bone, won\u2019t necessarily do the same to others. It was dark, disturbing, creepy, and humorous and I will be passing it around at work as there are a few who asked to read it once I was finished."}, {"userName": "Amy Seraphina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3371243-amy-seraphina", "userReview": "Oh my god! Doesn't even deserve half a star. A few pages in and I was instantly annoyed with this book. I knew this was a mash up and excited to get it in the mail, but i was hoping for some really witty macabre tale using Alice in wonderland as a base.I hold the original story close to my heart and I defend it against butchers like this... This... \"author\". It reminded me of Tim Burton's butchery of Alice last year (the only good thing was Johnny depp). The way the author just replaced parts and characters with simplistic dead things- graveyards and black rat instead of white rabbit- not very creative I must say, not really putting much effort into the horror side of the story. And the many use of brackets and inside comments against Lewis carroll's use of English (cite page 21, chapter 2), because did the \"author\" not realize the story isn't exactly a children's book per se. Growl! :(Cook is not funny and it was just boring and I was only up to the third chapter. This review may seem harsh, remember this is my opinion, but Alice in wonderland is my favorite books of all time and cook just wanted to get a quick buck with the whole mash up genre popularity to get published because he can't write an original book himself."}, {"userName": "Anita", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3202140-anita", "userReview": "Alice in ZombieLandAUTHOR: Lewis Carrol/Nickolas CookGENRE: Classic/Horror Mash-upFORM: Book \u2013 Advance Review CopySYNOPSIS: Alice and her sister go out to the graveyard to do her reading lesson when she gets distracted and sees a black rat checking his watch. Curious, Alice follows the black rat into a hole, and finds herself in a land where the creatures are zombies and ruled by an overbearing Red Queen. Alice finds that she herself is becoming more and more zombie-like and desperately seeks a way to go home.REVIEW: Assuming you like the classic/horror mash-up books that are pretty popular now, or if you just like a good Zombie book \u2013 this book is perfect! You get an almost humorous amount of blood, gore and zombies; and of course the crazy mixed up land of Alice\u2019s Wonderland. It probably has been about two years ago now that I read Alice in Wonderland for the first time, and I what I loved about the book was the double meanings and contradictions, which are of course still present in this version. I\u2019m not typically a lover of horror- like books (and I\u2019m trying to use \u201chorror\u201d lightly, it\u2019s not scary really, but I wouldn\u2019t read it to your grade-schooler!), but when I was approached about reading the book, it just had that fun, trendy appeal to it. And really, what could make the tripped out Alice in Wonderland even better? Zombies, of course! While it was funny envisioning all of the characters in Alice as flesh-eating Zombies, there were still parts where I was frowning and a little bit grossed out. WHAT I LOVED: I loved how Nickolas Cook took Alice\u2019s sunny colorful world, and changed it completely into a very dark cold one, starting right out with changing the happy tree opening setting to a dark damp graveyard. I wasn\u2019t expecting the transition to start out so quickly. I think I was expecting Alice to be her same sunny self, but sucked into this dark world, which I think would have changed the entire book, because instead of \u201ccurious-and-calm Alice,\u201d you would have had \u201cseriously-freaked-out-screaming Alice\u201d. Written this way, the Alice\u2019s are literally like day and night copies of the same book.NOT SO MUCH: Why is the rabbit a rat now? I don\u2019t know why this bothered me so much, because I can see how a rat fits in the book\u2019s theme, but a black zombie rabbit would have been FLIPPEN FREAKY, don\u2019t you think? Just imagine it with red eyes and sharp teeth\u2026."}, {"userName": "Fanny Towns", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6470221-fanny-towns", "userReview": "As a fan of Alice Alice in Wonderland...and zombies, I saw this book and couldn't wait to start reading.

I haven\u2019t read the original Alice in Wonderland story, so I don\u2019t know how close this one follows to that. Some of the storyline seemed familiar from watching the movie.

And because Nickolas Cook incorporated the same actions from the original story and modified new actions to go with the theme the story stays more consistent. For instance, in the original story, Alice had a drink and a tiny cake that were labeled for her to eat and drink, but in the story Nickolas Cook changes it to \u201cpoison\u201d for the drink. And with Alice\u2019s weakness of curiosity she drinks the solution anyway making her grow in size ending with her being the right size for the door she needs to enter. Or in other characters, such as the Cheshire cat that most kids know and surely love, has the same action of telling Alice where the two passages go and how she can go any way she desires at her own risk. As well as, disappearing as he pleases, however, because of the twist in the story the Cheshire Cat \u201clikes to eat little girls, not mice\u201d (Cook 108) again staying with the theme and making the story more believable, as well as staying more in the zombie-like characteristics. And Lastly, everything from the beginning molds very well to the end from the zombies having jeweled collars and being controlled by the red queen to the crave of meat pies that Alice has throughout the story. Alice puts her foot down and defends her new, dead friends against the Red Queen and her cruelty towards them, then later destroys the box that helps control the collars and sets the zombies free. As well as, helping them get revenge on the red queen for her crimes and eating her. However, even though that was not Alice\u2019s intention of them attacking the Red Queen she tries to stop them by screaming ( not only in frustration but in fear as well) later on waking herself up from where she started in the beginning of the book\u2026the graveyard. Where she finds out Zombieland was a terrible dream and finally gets the meat pies she has been dying for.As you read a story such as Alice In Wonderland, you think of the usual, such as a white rabbit that is always stressing over time, or the Red Queen having an army of a deck of cards. However, author Nickolas Cook modifies the family friendly story book into his own twisted tale with the help of his dark imagination. For instance, Wonderland isn\u2019t so wonderful, but is instead dead and renamed as Zombieland. The plot of the story does not change as much as the idea of the story such as, instead of sleeping on the bark of a comfortable tree, Alice hangs out in a graveyard and finds herself following a black rat down a deep, dark, scary hole; unlike a nice, anxious rabbit who is just trying not to be late for the Red Queen. This shows how Nickolas Cook incorporates the actual story and mold it into his own,leaving some similarities in the both. As well as, the characters who are known to be cheery and full of joy are now dead and trying to find a meal. However, the well know character the Mad Hatter is still a good character in both wonder and zombie lands. In zombieland he finds a way to control his hunger and help Alice through his journey. And with changing the happy story of Alice in Wonderland, instead of Alice\u2019s river of \u201ctears\u201d it is now blood from the cut she encountered when she went down the \u201crat\u201d hole which stays with her for most of her journey. Although, most of the main characters in the book are dead such as the Cheshire cat and tea party guest, the Red Queen and her king are human and living. And like in the original story, the Red Queen has the same personality and similar actions. For instance, yelling, being cruel to people (or in this case zombies), and as well as chopping off people\u2019s heads off. The main difference between wonderland and Zombieland Red Queen is their army. Instead of the army of deck of cards, it is the army of zombies and in order to control them she uses jeweled, red collars. And lastly, throughout the journey of Alice, she experiences a sort of change. Where her body absorbs the environment she is discovering and turns her into everyone else...a zombie. And develops a strong hunger where she wants to eat anything or one that gets in the way of her voyage."}, {"userName": "Dantie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23789976-dantie", "userReview": "It's kind of a rewriting fairy tales.

None of them have held my attention like this version. Alice in Zombieland kept me laughing page after page. I couldn't help but compare each of the scenes with my memory of how it was presented in a more traditional rendition. Alice is still a sweet, innocent girl, though her perfectly pressed dress and starched pinafore does take quite a beating and bloodying.The story starts with Alice and her sister outside enjoying the lovely day. This time they are in a graveyard., and it is a black rat that distracts Alice and leads her astray and down into an open grave. The tale continues to parallel Mr. Lewis's original story line, though the descriptive details and much more dark and dead. Zombie dead that is.As with the first version, I loved the description of the Mad Hatter's tea party. The teacups are all there, ample food to share and the same company. It was the change in the details that kept me in rapt attention. While I have had many tea parties with my daughter when she was young, I couldn't successfully imitate this one.I don't know that zombie books will ever become a first choice read for me, but this one kept me coming back for more. I loved the descriptions of the blood spurts and gore, the flesh ragged bones lying around and the listless responses of the 'cards'. Frequently I would stop and read a particularly gruesome passage out loud to which ever family member happened to be in the same room with me. I fear that they now think I am truly demented. If you have read Mr. Carroll's version and are looking for a read that is a lot less sweet, give Alice and Zombieland a read."}, {"userName": "Stormi (Books, Movies, Reviews.

I shall be late!\"I have never read Alice in Wonderland and I am not sure if I should have read that before this book or not. I know the basics of the story, but you put zombies in it and it gets a LOT weirder. So Alice follows a Black Rat instead of a White Rabbit down a grave and into the world of Zombie land. In Zombieland everything is pretty much dead. Alice starts to get hungry for flesh but she doesn't understand why. It's not till she meets the Cheshire Cat that she learns about being dead. \"Oh, you can't help that,\" Said the Cat. \"We're all dead here. I'm dead. Your dead.\" pg 108You can't have a Alice book without the lovely Mad Hatter and so you have the undead tea party. At the party Alice learns what happened to this strange land she is in and how the Red Queen controls the undead and uses her power to not just kill the undead but anyone who gets in her way. The longer Alice is in Zombieland the more she starts to change, soon she is starting to rot and her hair is falling out. Then as we all know how the story goes the Red Queen wants Alices head but all Alice wants to do is go home.I am still not sure how I feel about these new versions of classics, but if you enjoy them then you will like this book. Alice in Zombieland is a quirky, dark and can be a little gruesome at times. I myself found it to be sort of funny and laughable. I am not a zombie fan, but these are more laughable than scary zombies, except for the Red Queen she is sort of scary..LOL. I thought the book was okay though at times I found it a little lacking but over all I would recommend it to zombie fans or those who like the quirky new retaling of classics."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1956988-erin", "userReview": "When author Lewis Carroll took Alice through the looking glass in 1871, little did he know that a much more gruesome nightmare awaited his dear Alice. When 1864 Alice woke up in a land of wonder, 2011 Alice awoke to a land of the living dead ruled by a power hungry, yet very human, queen. Forced to listen to her lessons from her sister as they sit their favorite cemetery, Alice notices a black rat who seems to be in a hurry. More startling, he has a pocket watch and was quite verbally worried about being late! Unable to help herself, Alice abandons her sister to follow this black rat down a \u201cdead hole\u201d that takes her to a land that is bizarre as it is horrific. In her travels in this land, she meets a myriad of characters such as the Conqueror Wurm, the Corpse Turtle, and the Zombie Lobster.

Decaying every step of the way, Alice is relieved when she awakens in the cemetery next to her reading sister, just in time for tea. It was only a dream\u2026or was it?Nicholas Cook does a remarkable job of paraphrasing an entire work of classical literature in Alice in Zombieland. Keeping Lewis Clark\u2019s writing intact, Cook only changes a word here and there in the original Alice in Wonderland to create a nightmare world where a little girl is faced with a world of the living dead and her own zombification. Just as zany and dreamlike as Clark\u2019s characters, Cook creates inhabitants of this nightmare world that are both fascinating and terrible.

This book is exactly what the title says-it's Alice in Wonderland with the addition of zombies. And it was a weird read. There were points I wasn't sure how to feel about the changes they made to add in the zombies since it was either really stupid or really well done. Which I guess shows that I liked the book but felt it needed something a little extra to make it seem not as weird. Maybe if it was written by Seth Grahame-Smith it could have been a more cohesive mashup. But it was worth the read. I was entertained and liked the ending which are two things I look for in a book outside of a decent plot that actually makes me want to finish the book. (I'm talking to you Swan Thieves!) Would I read it again, maybe. Would I suggest it to others, sort of. If you want something silly and weird to read in one sitting, sure give it a try. If not, the original is just as good.

Would I read it again, pry not, but was it worth the first read through, yes."}, {"userName": "Jitka", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4536546-jitka", "userReview": "Tak jsem to nakonec do\u010detla...ale v\u00e1\u017en\u011b to byla p\u0159esn\u011b takov\u00fd ztr\u00e1ta \u010dasu, jak se od za\u010d\u00e1tku zd\u00e1lo.

For most of the book what happens is that the original text is used with some words dropped in here and there relating to the zombie theme such as the White Rabbit is now a Black Rat and the rabbit hole becomes a grave that has been dug but not used.Around two-thirds through the book some different material is added dealing with how the Queen of Hearts controls the zombies.The biggest difference is in the trial scene. Also, Alice's sister is a total bitch.I think more changes could have been made to the original story and still end up with a good story. As I noted above, the book is disappointing."}, {"userName": "Katarina  Martinez ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50927892-katarina-martinez", "userReview": "A book that should have taken me an hour to read, stretched out for days.

All of them were covered in Alice's now cold and congealed blood, which made them even tastier looking to poor hungry Alice.When little Alice follows the Black Rat down into the gaping darkness of an open grave, she falls and falls. And soon finds herself in an undead nightmare of rotting flesh and insanity. Venturing further into this land of zombies and monsters, she encounters characters both creepy and madcap along the way. But there's something else troubling poor Alice: her skin is rotting and her hair is falling out. She's cold. And she has the haunting feeling that if she remains in Zombieland any longer, she might never leave.Can Alice escape Zombieland before the Dead Red Queen catches up to her?", "title": "Alice in Zombieland", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10678311-alice-in-zombieland", "average": 3.27, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348477758l/10678311.jpg", "reviews": 245, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2958842.Nickolas_Cook", "name": "Nickolas Cook"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8164.Lewis_Carroll", "name": "Lewis Carroll"}], "type": ["Horror", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Fiction", "Humor"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10678311-alice-in-zombieland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9214714-alice-in-zombieland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10787726-alice-in-zombieland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7405041-alice-in-zombieland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15780358-dead-dog", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9228033-round-midnight-and-other-stories-of-lost-souls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6540669-the-black-beast-of-algernon-wood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11057922-paint-it-black", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6540670-baleful-eye"]}
