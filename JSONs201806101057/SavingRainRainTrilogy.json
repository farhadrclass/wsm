As far as \"Saving Rain\" goes, I have to say that I am torn. I really wanted to love this book. The concept of it was intriguing, and I was eager to get started on it. Unfortunatley, it was written in what I call; present tense and I found it extremely distracting for me. Most stories are written in past tense, and I have learned that I prefer this method when I am reading a story. There were a few times it bounced to and from past and present; but I did eventually get used to it for the most part. There is a disclaimer about the topic in the book which warns readers that there is dark content discussed in the book. This story does deal with childhood abuse, human trafficking, and physical abuse; but I will say that it is done in a way that doesn't come across as too disturbing or gruesome. This may be because I am a bit desensitized from some of my past reads that have been a lot darker, or that it was written more tastefully by the author. In any case, I didn't find the content to haunt me, and I found it a bit easier to swallow than some of my other reads.We are introduced to Raina who is 19 years old and has been abused not only as a child but also by her boyfriend. An incident occurs where she is badly beaten by her boyfriend, and an FBI agent who Raina has been aiding in a human trafficking case comes to her rescue. Kas has a soft spot for Raina, and when he finds out she needs help he steps right up to the plate and takes her into his home and his life. These two are working on a major case together; but they develop very strong feelings for one another extremely fast. The closer these two get, the more that Kas becomes aware that there is more than meets the eye to Raina. He gets desperate to find out what makes her so skittish, and who hurt her in her life. Meanwhile, Raina is falling in love with him too; but she has so many issues and fears, that she struggles with letting down her walls and letting Kas in to discover her secrets.I was rooting for this couple; but I did find it hard to become emotionally attached to them for the most part. During the story it seemed that they did more thinking in their heads than major interacting with each other. Their characters were often very contradictory as well. Most of the time Raina was very meek,mild,and easily intimidated; and then all of a sudden she would get a back bone and stand up for herself. Then with Kas, he was sweet,sensitive, and extremely patient; and then out of the blue he would try and pull off being demanding..and it just didn't fit his character that he was portrayed as for most of the story. These inconsistancies made it so that I enjoyed the story less.The big question I ask myself, is will I continue on with this series? I have to think on this because as I said earlier the present tense writing is really distracting to me and takes away from my enjoyment of the book. The end has a bit of a cliffhanger though, and I have to say that I am curious as to what will happen to Kas and Raina. Also, these two never did become intimate during Book one; but I hear they do in Book two!! Well, anyone who knows me, knows that I do like my books with heat!! I guess in my case, curiousity may win out! This is a book that some people who like a little more of a lighter alpha male might enjoy. Just be aware that it is written in present tense, and that is not common with a lot of stories. It is a very intriguing storyline, and there are some neat secondary characters as well. In the future, I would be willing to give this author another try with one of her other books. Thank you again Ms. Stewart for giving me a copy of your book, I truly appreciate your generosity!"}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3351964-tracy", "userReview": "This book had such a sad opening, that poor little girl. That little girl turned out to be Raina, all grown up now at 19 and still facing traumatic situations, my heart broke for her. Still she was a strong willed woman, very independant, she closed herself off toward men. But ever so slowly that one man managed to break through her defenses.Kas the FBI agent ;-) I could see the attraction to Raina as soon as he appeared in the book, he was gentle, kind, caring, always thought of others. And most of all wanted to earn Rainas trust. He was so patient with getting through Rainas emotional barriers. I loved Chase, he was a great character with his caring ways, and accepting people for who they are without judgement.I really liked that this book was in different POVs so i knew what Raina and Kas was thinking, even some of the smaller characters too. Although this book had some sensitive subjects, it was very well written and i felt myself drawn into the story and feeling the characters emotions. I also liked that this book didnt just turn into an instant relationship between Raina and Kas, there was a mighty big build up to that, around finding out what their jobs entailed and what they both dealt with on a daily basis, it gave the book alot of depth. I found myself with tears in my eyes through alot of this book so make sure your tissues are handy! The line i keep thinking about from this book is what Kas thought about Raina..... 'His beautiful, broken angel.' It really touched my heart.The ending....... Oh.My.God i was left sat here with my mouth on the floor, swiping back and forth thinking that cant be the end!?! I forgot it was a trilogy! I really NEED the next book :-)I was sent this book in exchange for my honest review .

Raina was abused as a child and now as a young adult, despite careful choices and the determination not to be a victim ever again, has fallen into the same pattern with the same type of guy as her father. Through one of her college classes, Raina has the opportunity to work with the FBI, where she meets Kas, the first guy in her life who does not try to hurt her. Kas will do anything to help Raina, but he quickly realizes he is way out of his league. He does his best, but it is not always enough.I think one of the things I loved most about this book was Raina and Kas' relationship. They felt an instant attraction to one another, but there was no insta-love (I actually hate that term, but I see it used a lot). Their relationship was given time to simmer and develop slowly. Raina does not fall immediately in love with Kas and trust him with everything she has. If it had happened that way, the story would have been ruined. Raina was abused and, as such, she has a hard time trusting anyone, including herself. She is not weak or a victim, though she has been made to see herself in that way, and it is going to take more than one man, no matter how patient and caring he is, to change that.While there are dark issues in the story, it is well written and the violent scenes/topics are handled carefully. The issues of abuse, rape, and human trafficking are very real, and the author does not pretty them up, nor does she give explicit descriptions that would be a turn off to many people. I have read many books where the characters were abused, and I believe (in my humble opinion) that this is one of my favorites, just because of the way the characters dealt with their issues. Rather than turning to drugs, alcohol, or aimless sex, Raina tried to make herself a better person, someone worthy of love. My only issue with this book was that there were many times in Saving Rain where the thoughts would switch from one person to another without any transition or warning, and it was very confusing. I found myself re-reading sentences or paragraphs after realizing the POV had changed suddenly. Overall, though, I really enjoyed the story and am looking forward to reading the next book in the series. Thank you to the author for providing me with a copy of her book."}, {"userName": "\u219c\u0188\u0266\u01df\u057c\u2602\u025b\u2113\u2113\u025b\u219d", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17896457", "userReview": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Saving Rain by Karen-Anne Stewart (Rain Trilogy #1)I was given this Saving Rain as a R2R, in exchange for my honest opinion. This is going to be tough because I don\u2019t know that I can truly express it in words. Every once in a while a book truly effects you. Whether, good or bad, it has lasting impressions that you will not easily shake. I still have an extremely strong love/HATE, with this book.Right from the start, I was imprisoned in my own personal hell, along with Rain. Every emotion flooded my senses. I was hurt, mad, ashamed, anxious, happy, doubtful, hopeful, nervous, untrusting, resentful, sympathetic, all at once. It has been an emotional roller coaster that I am utterly trapped on. If only I could get the damn seat belt, lap bar, and shoulder harness off, I might escape it. This book is the story of the \u201cSurvivor\u201d Rain. She has fond childhood memories, until one fateful day. That is when all hell broke loose and began raining down on her. Since that day she has lived in a constant fear, she can\u2019t hide from. Rain, like all survivors, lives her life day to day, and they seem to get better. I love the way she has learned to cope with her problems, it shows real courage to persevere in the face of evil. She still holds an innocence, that can\u2019t be broken and can find humor in things. But then it comes back to slap you in the face. Proving you can never escape the ghosts that haunt you.Kas works for the FBI. He is the lead, in a task force against human trafficking. He has everything meticulously planned out because lives are in danger, if they fail. He is used to playing the role of, \u201cKnight in shining armor,\u201d and he does it well. So he is absolutely beside himself, when it comes to Rain. Years of being a top profiler, when it comes to emotions and human behavior, send up all kinds of red flags. He knows she is hiding a brutal past, but can either of them truly live with the memories.At one point, I literally threw the iPad screaming, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare do it, Miss Karen-Anne. Don\u2019t you dare steal one more thing from Rain, hasn\u2019t she been through enough.\u201d I was so infuriated that, I had to walk away from it. But curiosity brought me back, and I had to know, if there was any hope left.I assumed there was going to be a cliff hanger, as this is the first book in a trilogy. But never did I expect one like that. Are you f&*$ing kidding me! The absolute despair will haunt me until I get my hands on book 2. This was like a horrific train wreck, that no matter how hard I tried, the memories came flooding back, and I could not peel my eyes from. I would highly recommend Saving Rain, but know this was an intense read, that is not for the faint of heart.Thank you to the author for reminding me there is still hope in the world."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10480068-christine", "userReview": "Review: This book had me from the first page. Those first couple of pages was hard for me to read since something horrific is about to be committed. You do not know at first what is happening, but when you do you hold your breath. When I realized what was happening, I starting screaming at my Kindle to get help. It was an emotional first chapter. The first chapter is my worst fear so it was difficult for me to read. However, saying that, it was well written.Raina truly went through a horrific childhood. One that is unimaginable. It broke my heart. What made me love her is that she was not an angry person, but one that tried to help others. The pain of her memories and how she tries to forget pained me. Raina is just a kind person.Kas is on the police force and working on a case to stop human trafficking of women and children. Raina joins his team to help him stop the trafficking. A lot of the interaction between Kas and Raina was predictable. Him being the guy that is attractive and really not looking for love, but can\u2019t help but fall for innocent and beautiful Raina. I loved it and I like those types of love stories. I can not get enough of them.Did I skim? No.Did I feel connected to the characters? YesPace of the story: The actual plot was well paced. Positives: I really liked the story. I liked the suspense mixed in with the romance.Negatives: Some of the emotions that the characters expressed for each other in the beginning of the book, I felt were told me. However, in the middle, I began to feel what they were feeling for each other.Do I look forward to the sequel? Yes. Do I recommend? Yes. The plot of the book is nicely done.A copy of this book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Emily (Mrs B's Books)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6885570-emily-mrs-b-s-books", "userReview": "** I received a free copy of this book from the author for an honest review**2.5 STARSThis story has a sad prologue, then it hits you with a sledgehammer with chapter one and continues to hit your senses right until the end and the dramatic twist.Raina is a very intelligent nineteen year old who is currently helping the FBI with her linguistic skills. However after her ex-boyfriend attacks her, things spiral with the sexy FBI agent Kas when he takes her in and looks after her.Kas helps Raina in becoming herself again instead of a victim, delving into her past and bringing out her most painful secrets and vows to always to protect her.She helps the FBI further with her computer skills and really lends a hand into the human trafficking case they are working on.Although I really love the story with this book I have big problems with the writing style. The context constantly jumps from the points of views of her major characters and adds some of the minor characters. Not only that is seems to jump from the first point of view to a third person point of view or more of a narration of their thoughts or feelings, making it seem unrealistic.Saying that though I was really drawn into the story, once I had my mind wrapped around the above.

Just even thinking about losing my mother has me in tears and to lose her at six years old would be absolutely devastating like it was for Raina.\"I want to go passed away and go with mommy to the better place, too.\"I am sure that whatever is in this review will just not do it justice! Saving Rain is in my top books of all time and has got to definitely be my favorite book of 2013 for sure!When Kas and Raina start working together within the FBI to take down the growing number of sex trafficking rings within the United States, they immediately take to each other and thier feelings quickly blossom. Because Kas is afraid Rain isn't ready, and Raina's self esteem is so low she doesn't think she is even on Kas's radar, they both try to deny their feelings for one another. They are so good together though! Kas takes care of Rain while she is recovering from a beating of a lifetime from her wannabe boyfriend, Chris. Gah, he treats her like a princess...opening doors for her, assuring she wants for nothing, and helping her cook breakfast every morning. With a little help from Kas's friend, Chase, and Kas himself, Raina begins to bloom like a rose in spring time! She starts to see that not every many hits, that a guy can get angry (because Kas and Rain do get into some doosies) and NOT hurt her physicall, emotionally, or sexually. Something, unfortunately, Raina has discovered isn't true with every man. Even those close to her.Kas, at first, let's Raina try and work through things on her own but when she doesn't open up to him so that he can protect her, things heat up. He isn't naturally overbearing but can be sometimes...all in good intentions of course! Raina, because she is really coming into her own and learning to think for herself, she doesn't take Kas's practically ordering to not do something laying down. When their tempers collide so do their desires for one another, and they are both tempted to throw their morals away and become one!Betrayal pretty much forces Raina to tells her story. About the abuse, the loneliness, and despair. Stewart had me crying my eyes out! I cannot believe what Rain has experienced and she is still standing! Not only that, but she still has this lovable innocence that you wouldn't expect from someone from her situation!The climax of Saving Rain had me speechless!I literally put the book down and had to prepare myself for what was about to happen! I cannot wait to read the second book in the series! Saving Rain is a MUST READ! Raina is the strongest female character I have ever come across!"}, {"userName": "Poet Gentleness", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14649015-poet-gentleness", "userReview": "First let me tell you that I'm a lawyer who specializes in child and woman abuse.Why did I started with this? Because this is the central theme of this book. But it is treated in a gentle and light way that while the theme might shock some, it isn't written in the dark tones that could make one cringe. On the opposite, it's very sensitively treated. There is no explicit sex scene, no explicit rape scene. The violent scenes are very well done. The author did a great job in expressing the feelings without spilling blood all over the book, but there is no escape. The violent scenes are there - if they weren't the book would be flawed. For those who have experienced this or have a weak stomach, it might cause discomfort. And although the theme is hard, the book can fit in a YA or a NA. The author informs on the blurb that this is for 18 and up, but considering that 14 year old girls are reading 50things of very horrible messages, as a lawyer and a teacher, I would recommend those who read the 50horrible shades of dirtiness this book without a second thought. But, as a mother, I would say 16 and up. But you should be the judge.The heroine, Raina is the victim here and the hero, Kas, is a FBI officer and her friend and then saves her from an attack, hence the name Saving Rain. Raina is not what you would expect from an usual abused child and teenager. She's a dear. Determinate, strong and gentle. No clumsy or dumbness for Rain. A hurray for you, Rain, and another for you, Karen-Anne. I've been sick with so many female weakness and clumsiness.Kas is not one of those typical hard, mind-torturing, alpha male I have seen recently. Sometimes, I miss a little of hardness in him - he is a FBI officer - that has too much self-control, but then, there have been so many bad examples in the literature recently that that it makes you want to kiss him for all his self-control. He is a gentleman, strong, and sensitive. This is what a woman should want in a boyfriend!!I got catch by the plot, despite it's not what I usually read (I prefer adult romances, thrillers, historical romances, poetry or philosophy) and I can say: Good job!"}, {"userName": "Flavs is Mrs David Gandy\u2665~\u2665\u2019", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10136059-flavs-is-mrs-david-gandy", "userReview": "Wow!! Thank you Karen-Anne for giving me this book!I have no words to describe it, from the minute I started reading I couldn't put it down. It was a late night for me two nights in a row just to see what is going to happen.The story is about a girl named Raina who I just fell inlove with. She is such a strong person after everything that she has been through (which in the beginning you dont know) but as you get to know her you find out that she is just a broken person from everything that has been done to her. When you meet her the first time it is not a good time, she is being attacked by her boyfriend and she is fighting back like crazy to get away from him. In steps Kas, the FBI Agent she is working with (as she is a whizz with languages and computers) to save girls that are being sold as slaves/sex objects to some serious disgusting men.From the minute he meets Raina they have this attraction but because she is with Chris (the douchebag boyfriend) she tries to deny it.But when things go totally bad with Chris (ends up in prison for beating her half to death) he takes care of. He is so patient with her and all he wants to do is just love her and take care of her.\"He wants to give her everything she wants and everything she needs. He wants to erase every bad memory to show her just how wonderful making love can feel. He wants to make it perfect for her, but he wants her to be ready, to be in charge. He needs her to regain some of the power they took away from her\"He does an amazing job with just getting her to be the person she is. As the book goes on you find out that her father abused her for years and you just can't help admiring this women who went through so much and yet she is such a kind/caring/sweet person who wants to help others.I am so excited to be reading the second one and can't wait to see what happens to Kas and Raina.Thank you Karen-Anne for this book, you are an amazing writer."}, {"userName": "Future Slayer Girl ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5302761-future-slayer-girl", "userReview": "DNF @ 15% The beginning had so much promise, and then once we got more than two characters in a room at once the head hopping was so out of hand, we got three POV in ONE PARAGRAPH!

The beginning drew me in immediately as it starts with Raina at five years old just finding out her mom has passed away in a horrific car accident. Her dad is distant and wants nothing to do with her anymore. The emotion in the prologue was outstanding and it made my expectations for this book really high. (This was my 1st BOOM)\n\n\n\nFast forward to when Raina is nineteen years old. She is strong willed and extremely smart but she finds herself in an abusive relationship with her boyfriend Chris. They have only dated a short time and she\u2019s not really \u201cfeeling it\u201d. He is smart and handsome but then she sees his mean streak. Left battered, bruised and unconscious in the hospital there is only one person who never leaves her side\u2026and that\u2019s Kas.Kas is her work colleague/friend and he is in love with her. He is drawn to her from the first moment he saw her. He knows she is in a relationship and he would never do anything to jeopardize that. He is a good looking FBI Agent who could probably have any woman he wants but it\u2019s just not in him to have meaningless relationships. He\u2019s not your one night stand kind of guy\u2026he\u2019s more of a forever kind of guy and he wants nothing more than to spend his forever with the beautiful crimson haired Raina. \n\n\n(Enter the fizzle\u2026fizzle)This is where the story went pretty slow for me. Sometimes I was thinking I just wanted to quit reading and not finish\u2026other times I found myself so engrossed into the story that I couldn't tear myself way from it. He\u2019s seen her feelings for him growing in her eyes, and he prays that her feelings are at least half as strong as his are for her. She is struck by the realization that she has already lost the battle. Her heart is no longer hers, it belongs to him, in all its brokenness and vulnerability. After the horrific events Raina has suffered throughout her life things are difficult for her. She thought she would take a chance at a relationship with Chris and that didn't exactly turn out. She has major trust issues when it comes to men and even though she knows Kas would never physically harm her there are still things that set her off and make her run. Kas is utterly amazing with Raina in knowing what she needs. He knows she has had a difficult past and even though he doesn't know all the details, he is willing to take his time with her. He will not rush her into anything. Their relationship was beautiful and it was amazing to see her growth throughout the book.She is becoming addicted to his touch, needing it more and more, and that sends her to terrifying and exciting heights.\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t want you to see him as some kind of monster,\u201d  she admits sadly.\u201cI don\u2019t see him as a monster. I see him exactly as who he is, a man who told his daughter she was to blame for her mother\u2019s accidental death, a man who continually beat his daughter with his belt so harshly it left welts, bruises, and even cuts, a man who locked away and starved his daughter, a man who made his daughter think she was weak if she cried when he was the one who was weak and got drunk every night instead of being the type of father he should have been!\u201d  Kas seeths. \u201cMonster\u2019s aren't real, Raina, but your father is!\u201d (Enter the 2nd BOOM)Kas and Raina are working on a human-trafficking case and being the genius she is\u2026she is more on the technology and translation side of things while Kas works more in the field. However, after some unforeseen events Raina finds herself right in the middle of the case at Kas\u2019 side. She is strong and determined to get the bastards behind the sale of these young girls. She is determined not to let her past interfere with the investigation and Kas tries to do everything in his power not to cause any more emotional pain for Raina. However, sometimes things have to be said and done. Can Raina forgive Kas for his behavior? Can Kas forgive himself for the things he had to do to protect the investigation and not be ousted to the traffickers? Raina wants to have a happy life. A life she never thought she could have. But when her past comes back to haunt her, along with a confession from Kas, Raina does the only thing she feels is right, the thing she always does\u2026 she closes herself off and she runs! Overall, I thought this was an pretty good storyline and I really liked the characters. Kas is passionate and so sweet and protective. He wants nothing more than to give Raina everything she deserves in life. Raina is a fighter and even though she has been through so much she is determined to follow her dreams and make something of herself. She is stubborn and it drives Kas crazy\u2026both good and bad.

I am extremely sensitive to domestic violence, child abuse and human trafficking! I've done quite a bit of my own personal research on the subject of human trafficking and that part of this story did intrigue me even though it can be difficult to absorb. After reading the book I was quite pleased at the way the author approached the very sensitive nature of this topic and gave us just enough information to get the idea without being too explicit. I can't say the same for the domestic violence or the child abuse. If you are sensitive to these topics just be aware that the opening chapter is somewhat explicit as well as the flashbacks to Raina's past child abuse. But, it is a little hard to \"get\" a character like Raina without dredging up the pain. I really, really liked Raina... she behaves as a woman probably would behave considering her abusive childhood. I love that she has decided to hold on to the last bit of innocence she has and save herself for the man she loves. Not having been given much control over her body in the past, it is the one thing she can give when she chooses... on her own terms. I thought it was a powerful message to send that innocence has very little to do with the physical act of sex but instead with the giving of yourself. Your body can be taken and abused but no one can really have you completely unless it comes from your heart. Yes, I like that a lot... Raina is a survivor. She could be wallowing in her own self pity but she doesn't. She holds her head up high and presses forward throwing herself into helping others and determined to be independent. She is such a courageous character considering all that she has been through. She also feels a connection with the girls they rescue from trafficking and it serves as a reminder that even though she endured similar pain, it could never compare to what these girls went through. So, it was almost a kind of therapy for her. I liked that... And what can I say about Kas?? Well, he is the best guy. He cares for Raina and recognizes that she needs protection from her past both physically and emotionally. I think he helped Raina finally understand that it is okay to admit defeat on some things and we all need somebody to take care of us. Despite the fact that the sexual tension is high between these two he promises to respect her needs and boundaries. So, all you ladies out there who are saying, \"Are they ever gonna??\" the answer is no! But, there is enough passion from this couple coming off the pages that it really doesn't matter. It simply is not needed nor would it be appropriate at this point in the story. But, I have a feeling it will come later in this trilogy... patience ladies... patience!! The best romances bloom slowly... And, guess what?? Yep... it ends on a big cliffhanger. No surprise there... it's a trilogy. The ending truly surprised me... I was a little annoyed at Raina but, we'll see how it all works out in the next book. Nice easy writing style, engaging story, very likable characters... intriguing enough to continue on to book two.

Part of her is determined to be a survivor, part of her is still the victim, but when Kas comes into her world she experiences something she has never felt before, protected and cared for as a person. But her damage runs so deep, she is afraid to believe her eyes, or her heart. Is his patience and caring a fa\u00e7ade? Can she truly believe she is worthy of what so many take for granted? Is real love, no strings attached possible? Is it safe to let her walls down? More importantly, can she survive without him?Saving Rain is a novel about a dark topic that should never exist, but Karen-Anne Stewart has done a remarkable job of presenting a horrific story in a such a way as to give both the reader and the characters hope for the future. Her writing is sensitive, yet does not hide the turmoil Raina feels as she struggles to rebuild herself into a strong \u201csurvivor.\u201d Ms. Stewart focuses on the healing power of love and compassion, while acknowledging the long journey ahead. Her characters are filled with depth, down to the last detail and often I was seeing them as Rain would, not as a bystander to the story. Some had honor, some obviously had none, but each was vital to Rain\u2019s story and ultimately her acknowledgment of her own inner strength. This is powerful writing and Karen-Anne Stewart is a powerful author with a presence far beyond what her published works would suggest.

Please do take note of the disclaimer. This book touches on some really heavy topics that may not be suitable for all. It addresses human trafficking, child abuse, abuse, and rape. I can't believe I had not heard of this series before. I signed up for a blog tour after reading and really liking the synopsis of a book. When I came to add it on goodreads I realized that it was actually the 3rd book in a series, so I had to pick up the first two books. And boy I am glad I did. This book probably wins the award for making me cry as much as possible in such a short time. By the prologue and first chapter I was already in tears. The story is about a 19 year old girl who is working as an translator on a Human Trafficking case for the FBI. Even though she faces some terrifying and brutal cases as she works as a translator and computer hacker, the real tragedy is what you find in past. Kas in a mid-twenties lead agent in the FBI, from the second he meets Raina he is immediately drawn to her. One day Raina is brutally beaten by her Boy friend Chris. As Kas takes care of her, he soon finds out that this was not the first time that she had been abused, but in fact the doctor finds evidence of repeated untreated old scars. Kas is determined to find out what happened to Raina, while Raina is trying to come to terms with her past and her new found feelings for Kas. Kas is she gentle and sweet and makes her feel safe, but thanks to a history of men who blamed her for things that were not her fault and made her self esteem so low, she is unable to see the treasure that she actually is. This book ends with a cliff hanger that will make you want to dive in to book 2.I believe I found this book at the right time in my life. I am currently doing my Psych Nursing rotation and just recently I had the privileged of working and speaking with someone who was seeking help from wife abuse. After speaking with this brave lady I was able to prepare myself for this series. As mentioned above this book is not for everyone. Some of the scenes are very graphic and hard to digest. But the sad reality of this, that even though this story is a work of fiction, situations similar to this are occurring daily.But don't let this persuade you against reading this book. Seeing Raina thrive and learn to love herself was absolutely amazing. And to have strong men on her side such as Kas and his bestfriend/clincial psychologist Chase is phenomenal. Also the suspenseful action packed mystery is also enough to keep you turning from page to page."}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3163971-lesley", "userReview": "I received a copy of Saving Rain in exchange for an honest review. Raina Kapture has managed to escape her troubled past, only to find herself in danger again, this time at the hands of her boyfriend. In addition to going to college, Raina's been working as a translator for the FBI under the supervision of Agent Kas Pierce. Kas and Raina have become friends and Kas will do anything he can to help protect Raina from danger. I love this story and once I started reading it, I had to keep going so I could see what would happen next. Karen-Anne Stewart has done a great job in writing a book that is thrilling right from the get-go and although you don't really know any of the characters yet, she's developed them so well that I could imagine the connection that Raina and Kas share and I loved watching Raina grow to trust Kas more and more, to the point where she was able to share her painful past with him. I do wish that I knew more about Kas' past, but since this is only book 1 in a trilogy, I'm holding onto the hope that we will get to know Kas even more in books 2 and 3. The subject matter is very heavy, dealing with abuse and human trafficking so it's not a happy-go-lucky quick read that will have you smiling and laughing throughout, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll want to keep looking. But if you're good with a broken heroine dealing with more junk in her past (distant past and not so distant past) than one person should ever have to deal with, and a hero who is willing to stand behind her and help her fight the brokenness while they both are put into more dangerous and heavy situations, this will be a must-read for you!I am looking forward to the rest of the books in the trilogy and also anything else that Karen-Anne Stewart writes."}, {"userName": "Jacqueline's Reads", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4197769-jacqueline-s-reads", "userReview": "Interesting blurb!Raina has tried to forget her past, forget the pain, but when she finds herself staring straight into the fury blazing in her ex-boyfriend's eyes, her dark past comes rushing back.

I can not deal. I need the second book like yesterday! Poor Raina! This book had me from the porlogue. It captured my interest from the first sentece.

I couldn't imagine growing up like she did and dealing with all that happened and coming out so strong at the. I was really disappointed that she eventually let it all get to her. Kas! Kas! Kas! Kas! Could you get any hotter? I mean come one! He is the first boom boyfriend that's a legit bad ass, he even has a badge! I don't know how Raina never gives in to that hottie with a body!!

It also had a great mix of romance and mystery which was very intriguing.Raina has a lot of mystery surrounding her. It is obvious that she has been through some sort of abuse and she doesn\u2019t trust men easily. She has spent several years gaining confidence and self-sufficiency. She is really smart and dedicated to her education. She never wants to rely on a man and I really respected that about her. She is so confused about the feelings that Kas brings out in her and she can totally see herself getting lost in him. She is really good at putting up barriers and not letting him know how she feels because she would be devastated if he didn\u2019t feel the same.\u201cEvery fiber of her being wants Kas, needs him. Her heart, her body, and her soul cry out for his love.\u201dKas is a genuinely good guy and he was attracted to Raina from the moment they met. He is so good at reading her and he knows that she has suffered from something terrible in her past and he desperately wants to know what it is so he can help her heal. He wants nothing more than to protect Raina and he is definitely more obvious about his feelings for her, though he doesn\u2019t tell her right away because he, too, is afraid of rejection. He could be a little overbearing and bossy at times but it was only to keep Raina safe.I loved the dual plot of this novel, which was the growing relationship between Raina and Kas and the sex trafficking case they are working together. Kas is an FBI agent and Raina is consulting on the case while she works on her doctorate. She speaks multiple languages and is a huge help on the case to translate for the girls involved. In the very beginning, Kas saves Raina from a dangerous situation and she is immediately enraptured with Kas. He makes her nervous because she can tell that he is the one man that could break down her barriers and that scares her. Kas is very determined and wants to break her barriers. When Kas learns what really happened to Raina, he is even more determined to help her heal and prove to her that not all men are like the ones from her past.I was super intrigued about the sex trafficking case and who the \u201cGhost\u201d was. As they get closer and closer, Kas puts himself in more danger and I was on pins and needles hoping that nothing would happen to him. I also enjoyed the sexual tension that built up between Kas and Raina after they admitted to each other how they felt. When Raina is confronted by someone from her past and she runs from Kas, I wanted to scream. Kas won\u2019t give up on her and it makes me love him even more. The ending was a definite cliffhanger and I was left wanting more.\u201cOh, I bet you can teach me all sorts of things, her mind wanders into sexual fantasies of Kas teaching her exactly what he knows, over and over again.\u201dOverall, I really enjoyed Saving Rain. The plot was intriguing and well-paced. I liked the characters and the growth they experienced together. This is the first book in a trilogy and I can\u2019t wait to see what will happen to Kas and Raina and find out if my suspicions about the \u201cGhost\u201d are right. I guess I\u2019ll just have to keep speculating until the next book comes along."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3973394-heather", "userReview": "I read the entire trilogy back to back to back. I could not put it down. I literally started one and kept going until it was done, then started another and kept going until I had to force myself to put it down at 3 AM, and then started the last one as soon as it was over. This is an absolutely amazing trilogy!In Saving Rain, Raina has just been attacked. Kas is her savior. Literally. We can see the attraction between them but neither of them are ready to admit it\u2019s there. Raina has been through more than any human being should have to go through, but this woman is strong. Not only is she working through her past, she is helping to take down the human trafficking ring. Both what she has been through as we get into it and the stories of these poor girls break my heart.This is a hard review to write because there are so many things going on, so many emotions that are building around their relationship, and the trauma she has gone through, and the things that are coming. I don\u2019t want to give away anything that isn\u2019t in the blurb, but to say this is without a doubt one of my favorite series now.Saving Rain was an amazing book to start it out with. Karen-Anne Stewart can pull that emotion right out of you through her words, through us sympathizing with Raina, through our hope that they get the human traffickers, through wanting her and Kas to completely find each other.I have to add that human trafficking is something we all should feel incredibly passionate about, and it is something we all should be on our feet actively fighting against, and books like this, that bring awareness to this horrible slavery in a way that engages the average reader, the one who doesn\u2019t want to read dry statistics or a non-fiction book, these are needed. This is something that is alive still in the society we live in, yes \u2013 even here in the United States and other developed countries. It happens to both girls and boys (men and women) that are brought in from other countries and to citizens of our own countries. It\u2019s horrifying and Karen-Anne Stewart is doing a beautiful service by bringing this into the light for some who might not realize that this is still happening.I loved this book.Karen-Anne Stewart is now on my favorite author list. She is an amazing talent.Thank you so much for my ARC!"}, {"userName": "Laura Greenwood", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19290780-laura-greenwood", "userReview": "Review forthcoming on http://a-reader-lives-a-thousand-live...I received a copy of Saving Rain in exchange for my review.Raina has started a new life for herself, studying hard for her doctorate, and working as an adviser for the FBI. One of the agents she works closely with is Kas, a team leader, and the pair can't help but feel the attraction between them when they are put onto the same human trafficking case. When Raina's ex-boyfriend is released on bail and comes after her, Kas and his best friend Chase, find her just in time. Determined to take care of the young girl, Kas moves her into his home, where the attraction between them grows stronger every day. But despite the care and devotion that Kas shows towards her, and the feelings she begins to feel for him, Raina just can't let go of the past she ran away from and trust him.Just as a warning before you pick up this book, there are some pretty serious issues dealt with by the main characters, both in the form of their jobs, and Raina's experiences. Though I try generally to steer away from anything spoiler worthy, this is the exception. There are many, somewhat disturbing in places, descriptions of human trafficking, as well as the memories of child abuse that Raina has, from both her father and her father's work colleague.Saying that there are some pretty serious incidents and themes in the book, there is also another heart warming quality to it. The relationship between Raina and Kas goes pretty slowly, in a very sweet way, and even when they have admitted they want a relationship they still go slowly, and in a way their attempts at not having sex are kind of sweet.As I mentioned above, the characters work for the FBI, and as you can imagine that means that some of the situations described can be pretty action packed, and I thought that the author managed to write those scenes just as well as the love scenes that she wrote.I've enjoyed this emotional roller coaster of a book, and I would definitely recommend it."}, {"userName": "Lisa @ 2bookaholics", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7142833-lisa-2bookaholics", "userReview": "Okay this book started off with a bang and just kept punching me in the stomach. Raina Kapture is a brilliant graduate student working who works with the FBI as a part of their Human Trafficking task force. She has the gift of languages and is a whiz at computer hacking. Kas is an agent with ability to read people's emotions. From the moment they meet there is a spark. After Raina is brutally attacked by an ex-boyfriend Kas is finds that this is not the only abuse she has suffered and is determined to get to the bottom of it and to break down her barriers and show her that not every man is going to hurt her. The more they're together the harder it is for Kas to hold back both his emotional and physical attraction to her and it definitely goes both ways. I really liked the storyline of this book there was so much going on and so many factors that came into play. Raina's strength and compassion for the girls they rescue is nothing short of amazing. To be able to perform the job she does after the horrors of her past is so heartwarming. Kas is an extraordinary person he's patient and kind with Raina but doesn't hesitate to pull her back when she is getting to far in. They're relationship is funny and sweet and passionate. He is overbearing and over protective but with good reason. As the book goes on and their relationship progresses old wounds are reopened giving each of them things they must overcome. I loved watching them work their way through every obstacle that was put in front of them. It's a bit of a cliff hanger and I had to rush to buy the second book\u2026 then the third. Thankful they were both out so I could get the rest of the story. If your like me and can over look a little bit of choppiness in the writing and a little bit of \"ya that would never happen.\" then this is an excellent read. There are morals and integrity in the characters and that was a bit refreshing for me with so much out there where the characters just act on every impulse.

She had the perfect life growing up \u2013 she was a ballerina, went to a school, and loved her adoptive parents. That is \u2026 until her life changed one day.
