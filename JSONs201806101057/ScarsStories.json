Kinsella's work. This book of short stories is the first, although he is more recognized for Dance Me Outside. All of the stories are written in the voice of Silas Ermineskin and are about things that happen on his small Albertan reserve. While many people dislike Kinsellas Indian book because they don't feel he can write authentically about Indians being white, I strongly disagree. I think his characters are flawed yet beautiful, and capture something of reserve life that often gets overlooked or left behind. There wasn't a single story I didn't enjoy."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18906157-maggie", "userReview": "I have read a lot of Kinsella in the past. This one slipped by me somehow. I always enjoy his writing. It is truthful and harsh, yet sweet and poignant. It will make you laugh and cry all in the same short story."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8834981-brian", "userReview": "Hard stories of down people."}, {"userName": "Lbaker", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5182359-lbaker", "userReview": "16 short stories, featuring Silas, and his friends Bedelia Coyote, Frank Fence-post, Sadie One-wound.Some of the stories I've read before, others were new to me.The book jacket describes the stories as full of laughter, but it is definitely dark humour, laughter that keeps you from crying. In the nearly 40 years since this book was published, there has been too little progress with First Nations, too much condescending by governments, too little understanding by them.I wish I could say that these stories didn't ring true, but they do."}, {"userName": "Paul Secor", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5737008-paul-secor", "userReview": "Kinsella's Silas Ermineskin stories are some of my favorite works of fiction. Scars, even though it contains some very fine stories, contains too much of what I think of - for want of a better term - as \"Tonto talk\" when using the verb, to be: \"The man be a boy, fourteen or so and Indian'; \"That Indian be stupid drunk.\"; \"it be kind of hard to make into English.\", etc. I don't find that in the other Ermineskin collections, and his use of \"be\" isn't consistent here, as far as I can tell. It bothered me enough that I won't be rereading or even keeping this collection."}, {"userName": "Richard Scarsbrook", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3896725-richard-scarsbrook", "userReview": "One of my favourite short story collections ever, which possibly influenced my own short story writing style. Kinsella is the master of the significant or twist ending that casts new light on the story just told. One of the highlights of my own early writing career was receiving a positive review from Kinsella for my first book, Cheeseburger Subversive"}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2300344-greg", "userReview": "I think this is Kinsella's first collection of short stories.
