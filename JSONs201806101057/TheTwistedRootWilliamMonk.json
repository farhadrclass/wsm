The story before this dealt with opium and this ones with another ugly hidden secret of the rich and famous toward their servants.Here's my latest:I am a fan of Anne Perry's mysteries series as this one with William and Hester Monk set inVictorian England. The whole setting, language, fashion styles, social and political happenings and all the uglies of the time is found in her writings. Proper (high) society to the dredge of the beyond what we know now, poverty and somewhere in between. Ms. Perry addresses crime within the era and in fact, society does continue to have it in 2013. Sometimes the harshness of the reality of what is done is disturbing and if the writer didn't have such memorable characters and lay out the story as she does, I might turn from it. I don't.This story is about murder, of course, and a court trial - as most of Ms. Perry's novels include- and the horrific lies told to keep an \"image\" and how that image is supported by high society. A woman engaged to a younger man from a wealthy family disappears with the family's footman who later is found killed. The woman is sought up one alley and down the other. Did she murder him or know who did? The young man can't believe his small fiancee would do that, nor will you believe who and why it was done. I like Anne Perry - not all are five stars though - and will continue to read to keep up with the unfolding of the Monks and all the other characters I've grown to like or not, but continue to be interested in."}, {"userName": "Hilary", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3282620-hilary", "userReview": "Monk and Hester are now married, and beginning to build their life together, each having to make adjustments in preferences and considerations. As expected, there are some tense moments: Monk mustn't try to lay down the law, or force Hester into the role of a subservient wife, if he wants them to be happy, and she must also allow him to retain some pride and decision-making.There continues to be medical and nursing history. Anaesthetic is now more commonplace, changing surgery for the surgeons as well as the patients. Hester, along with Florence Nightingale, is still trying to improve conditions at the hospitals and to train nurses to a higher standard, to make them skilled professionals rather than untrained, drunken cleaners. Nightingale is regarded, sentimentally, as a lady sweeping genteely through a ward at night, soothing fevered brows - rather as she is now - but is in the process of setting up her own training school (something which actually occurred in 1860, at St. Thomas' Hospital). Unfortunately Hester's hospital is not as forward-thinking.The social issue Anne Perry focuses upon here is that of veterans: those who fought in earlier wars, and the many who are now old and poor, unable to afford the medicines they need or to go to hospital. Used and discarded, these valiant soldiers who fought at Waterloo and Trafalgar are now the vulnerable in society, and yet hospital administrators and doctors seem to discount them, leaving only a handful of people and some dedicated nurses to try to help them.The mystery, of course, is murder, with the answer in long-buried history. Monk, Hester and Rathbone require all their skill and co-operation if they are to save their clients - if their clients are as innocent as they believe - and when the answer is finally revealed, it is the unthinkable."}, {"userName": "Mary Corbal", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37678846-mary-corbal", "userReview": "La trama es muy interesante y el final logra sorprenderte. Casi la mitad de la novela habla sobre c\u00f3mo eran consideradas las enfermeras en la \u00e9poca victoriana, por lo que la trama de los cr\u00edmenes se diluye un poco. As\u00ed y todo, la historia te atrapa y es una lectura amena."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/353707-diane", "userReview": "Anne Perry uses the cultural mores of the 18th century as the backdrop for her books, and in The Twisted Root the reader is delivered into a time when cultural taboos leave a woman ready to die rather than tell what she knows about three murders that she has been charged with committing. Even though the plot twists in this Perry book keep readers involved, the characters are missing the intensity of the earlier Monk books. It seems once William Monk recovered his memory and decided to settle into the domestic bliss of married life with Hester, some of the fire went out of each of them. Perry tries to rekindle that fire by depicting the inevitable conflicts, mainly unspoken, that must have been present in any 18th century marriage between an independent woman and a man who is unsure of how to define himself as the husband to this independent woman. The major secret of the book is apparent almost from the first. The only details left hanging are how and why the villain committed the crimes and who one of the victims is. One thing that is obvious is that the arrests and trial that play major roles in the plot bring home the inadequacies of the justice system of this time period. Evidence? What evidence? These people had motive and opportunity, so forget that there's no evidence against either of them that would stand up in a modern American court of law. I don't know how accurate that is to the reality of the time, but Perry usually does a good job of research.One problem with all of Perry's books is her insistence on repeating things the reader already knows. How many times do we have to be reminded that Hester served as a nurse with Florence Nightingale in the Crimean War? These repetitions do not further the plot and in this book they slow things down. Still, it's interesting to get a glimpse of the reality of domestic life during this time, and to know that Hester wants to hire someone to do the cooking and the housework because she doesn't like to do it. William goes along with her because her cooking does leave something to be desired."}, {"userName": "Katie Bee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38657732-katie-bee", "userReview": "It's fine. I find that with these Monk books, I can pretty much always put my finger on who did it from the beginning, but then Perry spends 500 pages of narrative investigating other things before coming back at the end and pulling the rabbit out of the hat to get her \"ending twist\" (often with the help of coincidence). I never get a sense of progression, or the little hints along the way that help the reader to build a case. Instead it's just \"who does your gut tell you Perry's picked to be the murderer\" - now read 500 pages and see what unlooked-for coincidence turns up at the last moment to shockingly convict them.If these books were really only William Monk, I wouldn't be reading them. I find him uninteresting, and the narrative is constantly telling me how brilliant and awesome he is at his job, when I don't think it proves it at all. In this book, we get the addition of some period-accurate sexism/patriarchal instincts towards his new wife Hester, which may be in character but only adds to my dislike for him. (I also think Perry rushed their relationship. I don't think they have any chemistry - again, the narrative just says they do, without showing it - and they went from vicious arguments to proposal to marriage in two seconds flat. I might buy things more if we'd had a book where they were shown to be falling in love, but that didn't happen. Proposal on last page of one book, married by first page of the next. And Monk demanding Hester be domestic. SIGH.)Luckily, there's also Hester and Callandra and Rathbone, who are great, and minor characters as well. I love Cleo, and Henry Rathbone, and Evan, and John Robb and his grandfather. My favorite parts of this book were Hester's relationships with the Robbs and with Cleo. Really very well done."}, {"userName": "JBradford", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946028-jbradford", "userReview": "This is #10 in the Inspector Monk series, although he has not been an inspector since Book #1, and Monk and Hester are finally married. (Is that a spoiler? Sorry about that!) Marriage has not hurt them, however, and the series just keeps getting better and better; this probably should get four stars instead of three. Perry keeps coming up with these odd murders (in this case, three of them), all tied together with some terrible social injustice brought about simply because of the inequality between the high class and the low, with innocent people being charged with hideous crimes from which only Monk\u2019s relentless pursuit of facts and Sir Oliver Rathbone\u2019s mastery of court procedure can save them\u2014except that, as usual, it is Hester, who solves the crime. As usual, too, we get some intriguing glimpses into life in Victorian British society, from its slums to its croquet parties in the garden, from below the stairs to the top of the stairs, from its hospitals to its courtrooms.This one starts when an anguished young man hires Monk to find his missing fianc\u00e9e, who dashed away from a pre-marriage party and disappeared with the family coach and coachman, whose body is found many miles away. With the typical extraordinary coincidences that fills Perry\u2019s novels, Monk finds that the missing girl was raised \\by a nurse from Hester\u2019s hospital, where there is growing concern about missing drugs. Monk becomes friendly with a rural policeman who is investigating the coachman\u2019s murder and also is taking care of a sickly grandfather, who though impoverished has a stock of medications in his cupboard. One thing leads to another, as it always does, and the story becomes as tightly wound as a strand of DNA."}, {"userName": "Greg Bascom", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9612959-greg-bascom", "userReview": "This is a splendid novel set in London in midsummer 1860. It begins with the abrupt departure and disappearance of Miriam Gardiner, a commoner, from a garden party celebrating her betrothal to Lucius Stourbridge, a younger man of considerable means. Lucius hires William Monk, an agent of inquiry, to find his fianc\u00e9e. With the particulars of this mystery launched, the story switches to Monk's recent bride, Hester, who is a volunteer nurse at the North London Hospital, which has a mystery of its own - medicines are disappearing. These two plots will intertwine.Within this historical setting, the author crystallizes progress in the past hundred and fifty years. I cringed at the subservient role of women in general back then, and the pitiful concept of the nursing profession in particular. Within this context, the author portrays determined efforts of strong minded women struggling without much wiggle room. However, to do this, there is excessive narration of the character's internal thoughts, the nuances of them, sometimes convoluted. If these were related through dialogue and body language, the read would be livelier.Masterful plotting drives this story. Around page 204, the culprit narrows to one of two characters; an experienced mystery reader would know which one. But why? Later, the author, instead of adding some implausible twist, explicitly eliminates cute surprises and gives the reader subtle clues, which keeps you turning pages, trying to figure the TWISTED relationships of secrets within secrets. This is edge of your seat plausible complexity with historical subtext."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Huston", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4091267-rebecca-huston", "userReview": "A very intense plot involving two story arcs that do merge. The first is about a missing widow, Miriam Gardiner, who has vanished on the day that she is celebrating her engagement to young Lucius Stourbridge. Missing along with her is the family coachman along with the carriage and horses. When the man is found with his head bashed in, suspicions fall on Miriam, being the last person to see him alive, but when Lucius' mother is found in her bedroom with her head crushed, Miriam is arrested. And she appears doomed to hang -- for she will say nothing in her defense. In a parallel tale, Hester is continuing to volunteer at the hospital but her attempts to modernize the care for patients and nurses' training is halted by a bureaucratic director. Then she finds out that one of the nurses is stealing morphine. Does Hester turn her in, or will she try to find the real truth? It's a fairly good novel, and has a nicely complex plot, but the reason why this didn't get five stars was that I was able to figure out who did the killing early on. I hate it when that happens. Overall four stars and a recommendation. Oh yes -- Hester and Monk have finally married.

Oliver Rathbone is then brought in to fight the case with little to go on but as the trial unfolds so do the clues unearthed by William and Hester.Now well into the series the writing seems to flow much better and there are less loose ends in the story.

Premise/plot: William Monk is hired by Lucius Stourbridge to find his missing fianc\u00e9e, Miriam Gardner. She disappeared during a garden party without a word. Monk, newly married, takes the case. As he begins work on the case, he stumbles onto a murder case that might just prove relevant to his missing person case. Sergeant Robb has found the body of a coachman. Robb soon is eager to find Miriam too, her probably being the last to see him alive. Meanwhile Hester is not staying at home doing nothing. She is fighting for reform and change in the hospital community. She has noticed that someone has been stealing medicine from the hospital where she volunteers. It turns out the thief has a heart of gold and is a kindred spirit when it comes to caring and nursing veterans. As so often is the case in Perry's novels, Monk, Hester, and Rathbone's paths and stories all cross. This one definitely has a twist ending. My thoughts: I really am liking the series again. Silent Cry seems to have been the low point for me. I am glad that Monk and Hester have wed, and equally glad that not any time is devoted to their physical intimacy in the bedroom. I was very, very happy to get one scene between Rathbone and his dad!"}, {"userName": "Debbie Maskus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2486098-debbie-maskus", "userReview": "As I have mentioned, Anne Perry's books improve with each new novel. Hester and Monk are newlyweds and attempting to adjust to this new lifestyle. Hester has never been a \"housewife\" and dislikes the confines of cooking and cleaning, and Monk will not allow Hester to work for wages. The story centers on a young widow, Miriam Gardiner, about to remarry. At a casual party, the prospective bride runs away without telling her reason. The coachman who drives her is found murdered five days later, and Miriam Gardiner has disappeared. Monk becomes involved when the future groom, Lucius Stourbridge, needs help locating Miriam. As usual, Perry discusses the problems of the time such as the sorry state of nursing. The majority of nurses could barely read and their wages were poor and consisted of a meal and alcohol. A surgeon might save a patient, but the nursing care after surgery was deadly. Sir Oliver Rathbone appears to defend Miriam and her friend Cleo from murder and from stealing medicine. Perry inserts the dilemma of war veterans that are sick and poor and cannot afford medicine or medical attention. Cleo has been stealing medicine from the hospital to give to these veterans. And of course, the ending is a surprise. I had figured the correct murderer, but not all the issues involved."}, {"userName": "Gayle Noble", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17445096-gayle-noble", "userReview": "When a woman engaged to be married disappears from her fiance's life for no apparent reason, murder and intrigue soon follow. I enjoyed this book. I thought the story was well-crafted, although the courtroom scenes went on a bit too long. It is easy to forget how poor the nursing standard was before Florence Nightingale and how much of a fight she had to get the establishment to consider nurses worthy of proper training. Character-wise, I continue to like Hester but I cannot fathom why she would have married Monk. I just cannot warm to him at all and personally I think she would have been better off with the lawyer, Rathbone.

Perry is masterful at weaving mysteries within mysteries. Then, another mystery needs Monk's attention. Hester and Oliver have work to do in order to assist in the solution. The social issues raised in The Twisted Root have relevancy to today's struggles: health care (and not just for military personnel); the strife of women used for sex trafficking; drug addiction; better care for the elderly and those without care givers. in the other books of this series, Perry seems to be heavy handed with some of the issues; I've felt she over-did the rhetoric. In this one, the story supports the use of the issues very well and does not rely on preaching about the ills of society. The relationship between the characters continues to evolve naturally, with the author's keen sense of how our emotions and rational thinking battle each other. As always, the thoughts of the characters reveal quite naturally how they feel and what motivates them to action. The Twisted Root is the best in the series, so far, I think. The title fits brilliantly with the plot and source of the trouble."}, {"userName": "N.W.

Missing drugs at the hospital where Hester now volunteers just adds to the mystery.This series has really hit its stride now. The last few books have been excellent, and this one is great. There are many twists and turns, only resolved in the last few pages. As always, Ms. Perry incorporates some social history into the story; here we see how veteran soldiers and sailors are treated after their time of service has occurred, something that unfortunately still happens in our own time.I was glad to see Oliver Rathbone again and find out how he was dealing with Hester's marriage to Monk. I also liked the introduction of the new police sergeant Robb and hope to see him in future books in the series.
