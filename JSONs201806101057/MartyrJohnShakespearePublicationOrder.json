That's about all the praise I can give it. WHY do all the heroes of these sorts of novels ALWAYS have to fall into the mold of \"the one person in a prejudiced society who has 21st-century notions of religious tolerance\"? Couldn't we, just once, have a hero who actually BELONGS to his time, who, say, believes in Walsingham wholeheartedly and believes that Catholics are not just \"following their conscience as best they know how and so we should allow them to do so\" but are actually damned sinners who are a menace to the state? Wouldn't it be interesting to have a character such as that be sympathetic anyway? Wouldn't it help us to understand the time period, and maybe, our own time and our own unquestioned prejudices?But no. We have John Shakespeare, William's brother, who is an incredibly enlightened man with modern notions of pluralism and multiculturalism, but who is nevertheless inexplicably trusted by Walsingham to root out Catholic plots against the queen. Jumping around between a dizzying array of seemingly unconnected characters, our intrepid hero unmasks traitors, tracks down murderers, deals with quite a lot of unnecessarily brutal fights and murders, and seduces a Catholic governess in what is one of the most laughable sex scenes EVER (yes, children, as we all know, good Catholic girls in the 1580's were only too ready to jump into bed with a man they hardly knew, especially if they suspected him of being an agent of the Usurping Bastard Queen. When this happened, the deflowering consisted of a moment of pain, followed immediately by practiced and ecstatic coupling, in a variety of exotic positions, and ending in simultaneous orgasms. You then proceeded to repeat the process twice before dawn. There was no fumbling, no shadow of inexperience, no worries about getting pregnant or catching an STD, no worries about sin, and quite a lot of knowledge about how it all worked and what made it pleasurable for a woman. Yes, that's exactly how it was).I cared enough to keep going in order to find out who committed the initial murder, but that was also pretty underwhelming."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5341034-dawn", "userReview": "I do like this era and the idea was good, I just don't think Clements managed to pull it off.John Shakespeare is an investigator for Walsingham, charged with keeping Sir Francis Drake from being assassinated and rooting out any Catholic plots against the queen. Fellow investigator and rival Topcliffe always seems to be just ahead of Shakespeare in the investigation, using his brutal methods to get the answers he wants from the victims and perpetrators.There were two things that jumped out at me from the start. First: I felt the characters were a bit one dimensional and typical, as in, the spunky girl willing to state her mind no matter what or the bad guys with no redeeming attributes or the hero just trying to do everything honourably. Second: the writing was so full of clich\u00e9s it felt like I was reading a newspaper article not a book. I did like the Will Shakespeare parts. I also liked how they all talked about Queen Elizabeth with her moods and avoiding her at times. I actually really enjoyed several of the bit players, Jane and the clubfoot guy (I can't remember his name right now), the two whores and Harry Slide........The atmosphere was also well done. The legislation to go to church on Sunday and the fear of being Roman Catholic was portrayed great.I found the last half too rushed, going here and there, it felt like it was all over the place, trying to tie up loose ends and characters."}, {"userName": "Susanna - Censored by GoodReads", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1109068-susanna---censored-by-goodreads", "userReview": "Good grasp on historical details.

While investigating the brutal murder of a noblewoman, Shakespeare finds himself drawn into an assasination plot against Sir Francis Drake and the hunt for a deadly Jesuit; what he discovers shakes his belief in himself and the world around him.Mr Clements excels in his debut. While he can write spine-tingling action with flair, his best asset is his ability to render believable, flawed characters, as well as the complexities of a society torn apart by religious discord, poverty, and greed. Highly recommended for fans of C.J. Sansom and Steve Berry."}, {"userName": "Wolf", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5636165-wolf", "userReview": "There are some books that never quite escape the shadow of the books that inspired them. Here it is hard to escape the feeling that C.J. Sanson's Shardlake books were not just an important inspiration, their success was, for the publisher at least, the real reason behind this book. Even the one word title seems designed to evoke Sansom's oh-so successful formula. But Clements' novel is nothing like as well done.Whilst not badly written, the characters are essentially flat and appear too obviously to be driven more by the demands of the plot rather than any inner life. The central character, John Shakespeare, can be shrewd or dim depending on the author's needs. Clues are scattered through the book more, it seems, because the plot demands them than for any particularly credible reason. None of which need necessarily matter, if the plot itself is sufficiently ingenious or thrilling - no-one demands perfection of an Agatha Christie or a James Bond movie. But again, the flaws are too evident.The story of an assassin stalking Sir Francis Drake before the Spanish Armada clearly owes a debt to Day of the Jackal. In that book Forsyth's skill is in telling a story where we all know what the outcome must be but still creating tension. It is created in the calm professionalism of the killer and the desperate attempts to discover information about him and track him. The simplicity of the action gives it strength. Here that approach is unwisely put to one side, with extra deaths to investigate, incidents that appear to have been grafted on from another story, and the assassin displaying nothing of the deadly efficiency of the Jackal.Finally, the world of John Shakespeare never rings entirely true. The characters might be dressed in the ruffs and doublets of the day, but they don't wholly convince as sixteenth century people. The most important part, for me at least, of Sansom's winning formula is therefore missing.The novel is perfectly serviceable but don't expect anything that challenges or truely grips. For a more interesting approach to Walsingham's intelligenciers and the Armada you could try Patricia Finney's book 'Gloriana's Torch'."}, {"userName": "Abigail", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4917481-abigail", "userReview": "The queen's cousin is found murdered in an unlikely place and in a terrible way. Spymaster Walsingham calls on his lieutenant John Shakespeare to solve the mystery. Shakespeare follows clues and red herrings and uncovers conspiracy.I was rather underwhelmed. It looked exciting, it's a time period I enjoy reading about and I like a good mystery. The historical aspect was very well done (hence the 3 stars instead of 2) and interesting, the mystery, not so much. There was just too much trying to be contained in this story making the eventual reveal fall very flat with me. I frankly just didn't care any more. A few twists and turns and added clues are usually good, but 'Martyr' was making me feel like a martyr for trying to understand where all of the story was going.This book just could have been much tighter, there was too much of it. Also John Shakespeare himself felt very boring to me. I was much more entertained by the multitude of side characters. Granted, much of the book changes perspective to the fringe characters, but as a leading man, shakespeare was just BORING. Certainly no D'Artagnan (the fictional hero stick to whom all fictional male heroes are measured to in my book).It wasn't a bad book, just very blah.

Neither did I. LOL John begins investigating the death of a woman, a noblewoman distantly related to Queen Elizabeth. Her body is found in a burned out house, carved with profane religious symbols--and she was with child, the fetus having been sliced from her body before the fire, which only partly consumed her body. While he's investigating, he uncovers a plot to murder Sir Francis Drake, Vice Admiral of England's Royal Navy and their only hope to stave off a Spanish invasion, and must also try to foil that plot while still looking for the killer of Lady Blanche Howard. All the while, he's working at cross-purposes to one Richard Topcliffe, a trusted advisor to the Queen, who has it in for Shakespeare and always seems to be one step ahead of John's efforts. Walsingham, not wanting to incur the Queen's ire, tells Shakespeare he'll just have to put up with Topcliffe.Set during 1587 with the backdrop of the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots and the attempt by the government to hunt down and kill Catholic priests and arrest those found practicing Catholicism, this book was gripping at the same time as it felt tired and rehashed. The author used a lot of well-documented details to flesh out and authenticate parts of the story, but anyone who's read a bit of Elizabethan history will have heard most of it before. The story had an interesting beginning, but I found the intrigue to peter out a bit towards the middle and became rather predictable, even down to the romantic twist for Shakespeare. I'll probably read the next one in the series, although it won't be anytime soon."}, {"userName": "Susan in NC", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/883451-susan-in-nc", "userReview": "As a fan of C.J. Sansom's outstanding Matthew Shardlake historical mysteries, I have to agree with the previous reviewer that John Shakespeare's debut outing doesn't quite measure up to that level. However, Clements does a pretty good job keeping everything moving, until the last quarter of the book or so, which dragged for me. I kept feeling like we were heading for a big denouement, but it just slogged on (in the case of John's \"frantic\" chase to Plymouth, literally. . .) The requisite \"winding up\" of loose ends seemed to take forever! John is similar to Shardlake in temperament (smart, sensitive, thoughtful, questioning the use and abuse of power by his fellow Englishmen in service to the Crown), but John is a bit of a wimp, frankly...Shardlake, even with his hunchback, seems tougher in a fight! Some of the supporting characters (Sir Francis Drake, Walsingham and Boltfoot Cooper) are very interesting, and I hope they return in future books. The villain in the piece, Topcliffe, is a totally reprehensible human being, and since he's also serving Elizabeth I and appears able to act with relative impugnity, I could see interesting conflicts ahead. He is so close to being over-the-top evil, however, that he overshadows the Jesuit assassin sent to kill Sir Francis, supposedly one of the key plots in the book. If this continues, I think I would rapidly lose interest in the series, as I don't think Shakespeare could be a competent \"intelligencer\" with someone on his own side (supposedly) constantly hiding/destroying/subverting witnesses, information and evidence! Having said that, I will try the next in the series, but I do hope John toughens up a bit, if for no other reason than it will help him hold his own against Topcliffe."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10449860-david", "userReview": "The general consensus amongst the other reviews I have seen is that \"Martyr\" bears many similarities to C. J. Sansom's Shardlake books, but just isn't as good. I would tend to agree, though I don't think Rory Clements need worry too much about that. Shardlake sets the Tudor murder mystery bar very high, if William Shakespeare's fictional brother is even half as successful as his Henrician equivalent then the author can at least look forward to healthy sales.Yes, it is very brutal in places, but I actually think it is good to be reminded of the atrocities carried out on both sides of the Anglican-Protestant/Catholic divide in the sixteenth century, and not just for historical reasons. Whilst this book doesn't make any claim to be improving literature, it might still make educational reading for anyone who believes that torture can ever be justified.Is it cheapened a little by the many references to women's breasts and to men scratching their private parts? Perhaps. Then again, perhaps there was a lot of scratching going on in sixteenth century London, when standards of personal cleanliness were very different?Another reviewer Margaret Pritchard Houston makes a very good point about how the heroes of this sort of book are very often more like twenty-first century liberals rather than true representatives of their time. I noticed this too, although it does not irritate me as much as it does Margaret. I doubt I could have stuck with the book if its hero was the odious Topcliffe."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5880552-samantha", "userReview": "This book was a quick, enjoyable read for me. As a fast-paced mystery with a likable protagonist and a skilled creation of the Tudor world, it captivated and held my attention. I liked the fact that even though Queen Elizabeth never appears in a scene, the reader is given a strong impression of her character and heavy hand on events.\"Those who caught her eye lived a life between heaven and hell depending on her moods, which were as changeable as the weather: one moment sunshine and balm, the next thunder and rage.\"Digging a little bit deeper, this book has a few flaws. John Shakespeare makes a great first impression, but I began to wonder what it was that he really believed and stood for as the book carried on. He is willing to risk his life to do his job, but why? The religious battle that grips the country seems to matter little to him, and he has no problem arresting one Catholic and sleeping with another.Yet it wasn't until the odd Mother Davis bit that I took this book out of 5-star contention. I'm not even sure what to say about that strange episode.The conclusion of the book felt a bit rushed after all the suspense of getting there, but the appearance of Will Shakespeare was a fun way to wrap things up.

This was an era when paranoia was alive and well (and often with good reason) and Mister Secretary, Sir Francis Walsingham and his spies or intelligencers played a significant role in shoring up the safety of the land and its monarch.Enter John Shakespeare, brother to William and a clever, generous and handsome bloke to boot, who is recruited into Walsingham\u2019s network. Between the brutal murder of one of the queen\u2019s cousins in a burnt out house on London Bridge and a plot to assassinate Sir Francis Drake, John has his work cut out. Alongside all this, King Philip and his armada threatens, Mary Stuart is poised for execution, while Jesuit priests walk the streets, harvesting English souls, evading capture by hiding in the houses of Catholic sympathisers. Tasked with discovering Drake\u2019s would-be assassin, the killer of the queen\u2019s cousin and the recusants hiding the Jesuits, Shakespeare is forced to confront his own beliefs, his heart\u2019s desire and the fears and realities of both Protestants and Catholics alike. Watching his every move but always seeming to be one step ahead is the awful character of Richard Topcliffe who, in real life, was known to be a blood-thirsty sociopath with a genuine love for torture. His name alone was enough to cast a long and horrifying shadow \u2013 and if you read books on the torture of the time and what this man did, it still will\u2026  Topcliffe knows that John has secrets, secrets that could undermine his position, family and his life. But when the assassin and Topcliffe start to threaten those John has grown to love, the stakes become even higher.I thoroughly enjoyed what at times is a very, very gory book that doesn\u2019t hold back from the shocking realities of Elizabethan life for the men and poor women who were held in thrall by violent, powerful people. The constant pressure brought to bear on Catholics and the religious schism that existed at the time is painful to read, but also reflects what was again a reality for many folk.In some reviews I\u2019ve read, readers\u2019 criticise Clement, the author, for giving his hero what they term \u201cmodern religious sensibilities\u201d, meaning, I think, a tolerance for both sides of the religious divide. The historical facts record that just like in any period, while there were fundamentalists and those who truly believed their soul was at stake if they adhered to a different set of religious principles, there were also those very tolerant and even ambivalent about specific religious practices, even if they never doubted God. This period was not as black and white as many other writers of the era make out, so in that regard, I think Clement has done something very original and interesting with John Shakespeare and the other characters who populate this book. Certainly, his evocation of the era is outstanding and his use of language rich and fruity. I really enjoyed this book and upon finishing it, immediately commenced the next in the series."}, {"userName": "Marty", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5877828-marty", "userReview": "I like a good historical mystery. This book, while not one of my favorites, is a good read on the whole. John Shakespeare (he's the brother of the Bard) is employed as a chief investigator by Queen Elizabeth I's spymaster, Sir John Walsingham. It's a bad time to in England if you're not English and/or Church of England - Elizabeth is struggling over her decision to execute her cousin, the traitorous Mary, Queen of Scots, there's a rogue priest on the loose, and someone has murdered and ghoulishly mutilated Lady Blanche Howard, a distant relation of Elizabeth and a recent convert to the Catholic faith. The Spanish are threatening war. Sir Francis Drake's life is in peril and Shakespeare is charged with finding the Spanish agent who is to carry out the bloody deed.The historical details that Clements carefully weaves throughout the plot are wonderful. He even provides a glossary of terms in the back of the book for readers who are not conversant in 16th century English colloquialisms. The problem with this novel is twofold - John Shakespeare, as a man of the time and an investigator, is perhaps a little too understanding, compassionate and liberal with those he must interrogate in the course of his investigation. Most officials of this period, unless they were Catholic themselves, would have had little sympathy with those of the 'Romanish' faith. The brutish character of Topcliffe is more believable in that respect. The other issue is the number of plot threads a reader has to keep track of in the process of getting through the novel. Twists are fine - but more than a half dozen tends to confuse the issue. Still, this is period I love to read about, the historical detail is great and the outcome of Lady Blanche's murder investigation was a surprise, at least for me."}, {"userName": "Bandit", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit", "userReview": "Trying a historical mystery again after Rebellion's Message. This one is set in the same time period, but Clements is much more impressive with his writing, plotting and evoking the sense of a bygone era. You may have heard of William Shakespeare, bard extraordinaire, who does make a brief appearance in this story. Well, Clements has invented him a sibling, John, on top of all of his real life brothers. John Shakespeare is a Queen's man working for Sir Francis Walsingham, who was the principle secretary to Queen Elizabeth the I and the original spymaster. As such he must undertake daring missions, solve murders and protect important personage, in this case Sir Francis Drake...all while navigating the delicate balance of court intrigues and social politics of the day. This was quite an enjoyable read, the historical setting was rendered vividly in all its unhygienic glory, the plot, convoluted and complicated as it might have been, was actually possible to follow confidently, John Shakespeare is a credible, strong and compelling character, a moral man in an often immoral world. He seems like a solid leading man for a series, as much as I dislike series. And the author has done a very good job of creating a literary universe worth revisiting. This interesting and entertaining armchair trip to Elizabethan England should appeal to any fans of history, mystery or, of course, a combination of both. Shakespeare (no, not John) did mention something about brevity being the soul of wit and this book is quite expansive, but it reads well and quickly enough, pacing being the key.

There will be inevitable comparisons to the Shardlake Tudor mystery series, which I like --- but I think I am going to like this one as much, to judge by the debut volume. It is set in the month of Mary Queen of Scots execution (February, 1587), and the hero is John Shakespeare, you-know-who's older brother, who is an intelligence agent for Francis Walsingham. Clements vividly creates London at the autumn of Elizabeth's reign. The characters use a rich Tudor vocabulary, and Clements trusts his readers to \"get\" the meaning of words through context. I also thought it was interesting to use a Walsingham agent as the hero --- but Clements uses Richard Topcliffe, who really was beyond the pale, as a counterpoint, and sets up a strong romance with a Catholic character for Shakespeare. The plot had enough twists to keep me going, but I was mainly interested in the depiction of England during this period (when I watch Titanic I spend most of my time looking past Rose and Jack to check out the accuracy of the ship recreation, so fair warning). Amazon is offering a lot of discounts on the books in the series, so I went ahead and bought them all. I finished the second one in a long gulp yesterday, and it was even better than the first, so I look forward to the rest of the series.Recommend, but with some reservations.

The hero of this story is William Shakespear\u2019s fictional brother (not too sure that this relationship was completely necessary, and it certainly wasn\u2019t key to the plot, but perhaps the author\u2019s going to make more of it in future novels), John, who as Walsingham\u2019s top agent, is tasked with protecting a belligerent Sir Francis Drake from a ruthless Spanish assassin. The characters were all believable, and I was gripped by the fast-moving plot involving the gruesome murder of one of the Queen\u2019s relatives, prostitution, double-dealing spies, torture, and a hired assassin. Of course, Shakespear has an arch nemesis, another spy called Topcliffe, who happens to have direct access to Queen Elizabeth, and is described as one of her \u2018favourites\u2019 (she seemed to have rather a lot of them!). Topcliffe\u2019s a good character, but his relationship with the Queen is not really explained and without this understanding, it\u2019s hard to accept his omnipotence. Still, that\u2019s a relative small quibble in an otherwise enjoyable story.The book was clearly well-researched, without being heavy going or losing its excitement. Some other reviewers have compared Clements unfavourably to CJ Sansom, but I think that\u2019s unfair. In my opinion, this book is as good as the first two Shardlake novels.

I think I need to take a break from Queen Elizabeth and her battles over religion and the intrigues and treachery of her reign.Of the 50 or so pages of the book I did finish, I will say the sense of place the author creates is well done. His descriptions were good at making me feel like I was there in the moment with the characters, so that was a positive.However, the characters themselves didn't really connect for me. They somehow felt pale and I didn't feel an engagement with them so it was hard for me to get excited or worried about what was happening to them, and that's usually a death-knell for me for a book.Finally, I found the descriptions of violence and sex excessively distasteful. While they were a legitimate part of the story, they just struck me as a bit too gleefully ghoulish.

For example, John Shakespeare was Shakespeare's father, not his brother.That's perhaps a minor quibble, but there are other broad stretches of history in the books that I find disappointing and knowing that I'm reading a \"broken\" history just doesn't sit well with me.I found John and Catherine's feelings for each other to be totally unbelievable given how they met and interacted, but the final straw was the baby being killed at the end. I suppose that sounds silly given that I read about the torture of adults in this book, but having a lovely 20-month old daughter running around the house, reading about children getting killed is particularly painful.If these are issues that you think won't bother you, by all means get the book.

The mystery lost it's punch and I just didn't seem to care as much what happened at the end. I think as a debut novel, it is a very decent start. The reviews of the later books in the series improve with each one. I probably won't read anymore in the series just because it's not my preferred time in HF and unless it's really good, I have too many others books to get to first."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56328-paul", "userReview": "A series of books following the fictional life of John Shakespeare, the Bards brother, who works for Walsingham and others solving mysteries in Elizabethan England. Good on period detail. A noblewoman is found murdered and fingers are pointed at the latest scapegoats, Jesuit Priests.Fr. Robert Southwell and others are on the suspect lists. There is a small cameo made by William. While John is out of town protecting Drake from an assassin, his house is entered by the \"bad guy\" Topcliffe and his men to take a Catholic woman and here 2 children. When his forces enter, there are a number of men already in the house in combat uniforms and with swords. Topcliffe backs down and out. The men in the house are the Queens Men, Shakespeare's new troupe and in their costumes with blunt swords. But the ruse works.Good story, several volumes to follow."}, {"userName": "Ken Vaughan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2941130-ken-vaughan", "userReview": "A suspenseful, evocative Elizabethan mystery featuring John Shakespeare (brother of William, who makes a cameo appearance). The Spanish armada is poised to attack England, and Mary Stuart awaits execution. Tension between Catholics and Protestants runs high. A young noblewoman has been found brutally murdered in a burnt out house in London, and clues on and around the body point to conspiracies against the Queen. Francis Drake is adored as England\u2019s greatest naval leader, but there are those across the Channel who want him dead. Shakespeare must piece together a complex set of clues to untangle the connections between the multiple threats to England\u2019s security. You can smell the city in these pages. The fear and anxiety among the cast of characters is tangible."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2437452-anne", "userReview": "This was a reasonable good book for a first book, but had little to keep me wanting to read it every day. The idea of mystery using Shakespeare's brother John as a protagonist was an interesting idea. He was asked to find out who murderd a relation of the queen, and while doing so comes across Jesuits hiding from her edict against Catholics, prostitutes who profit from a murder they did not commit, a cruel, evil man who uses his position to prosper, and a nice lady who interests John. I'm still not sure the priest did it, Topcliffe seemed like a better villian."}, {"userName": "Hannah Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14188805-hannah-elizabeth", "userReview": "It had the potential to be a gripping thriller - that much is abundantly clear. However, there was too much going on all at once, with too little time dedicated to any of it. The plot was undercooked; I found myself forgetting half the characters before they were even ushered off the page, and it all seemed rather rushed. But the writing itself was faultless. It was just the plot and all its aimless meandering I found disappointing."}, {"userName": "Alice", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6105401-alice", "userReview": "This book, set in Elizabethan London, was a great read. Centered around an Intelligencer named John Shakespeare, the plot weaves its way in and out of London's whore houses and prisons, as John races against the clock to discover an assassin, solve a mysterious murder and locate a notorious Catholic priest. All this while he battles his arch nemesis and falls head over heels with a papist!"}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1378222-gary", "userReview": "The period is interesting and the historicity is good but the characters are somewhat two dimensional and the plot is predictable. Damning words I know but strangely I still enjoyed the book and will read the next one I am sure. It's a light weight read and flips along with no great demand on me and sometimes that's all I want from a book. So, no great shakes but it'll do."}], "description": "In this ingenious debut, Rory Clements introduces John Shakespeare, Elizabethan England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most remarkable investigator, and delivers a tale of murder and conspiracy that succeeds brilliantly as both historical fiction and a crime thriller. \nIn a burnt-out house, one of Queen Elizabeth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aristocratic cousins is found murdered, her young flesh marked with profane symbols. At the same time, a plot to assassinate Sir Francis Drake, England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most famous sea warrior, is discovered\u00e2\u20ac\u201da plot which, if successful, could leave the country utterly defenseless against a Spanish invasion. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1587, the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reign is in jeopardy, and one man is charged with the desperate task of solving both cases: John Shakespeare. With the Spanish Armada poised to strike, Mary Queen of Scots awaiting execution, and the pikes above London Bridge decorated with the grim evidence of treachery, the country is in peril of being overwhelmed by fear and chaos. Following a trail of illicit passions and family secrets, Shakespeare travels through an underworld of spies, sorcerers, whores, and theater people, among whom is his own younger brother, the struggling playwright, Will. Shadowed by his rival, the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief torturer, who employs his own methods of terror, Shakespeare begins to piece together a complex and breathtaking conspiracy whose implications are almost too horrific to contemplate. For a zealous and cunning killer is stalking England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s streets. And as Shakespeare threatens to reveal a madman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocking identity, he and the beautiful woman he desires come ever closer to becoming the next martyrs to a passion for murder and conspiracy whose terrifying consequences might still be felt today\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Martyr\n      \n          (John Shakespeare [Publication Order] #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6397014-martyr", "average": 3.74, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440992298l/6397014.jpg", "reviews": 246, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2878975.Rory_Clements", "name": "Rory Clements"}], "type": ["Historical", "Mystery", "Historical", "Fiction", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6397014-martyr", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6428094-martyr", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6665057-martyr", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11404653-martyr", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21801879-martyr", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7717188-martyr", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7031035-revenger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11284827-prince", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13512047-traitor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23588565-holy-spy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16093526-the-heretics", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193858-the-cuckoo-s-calling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
