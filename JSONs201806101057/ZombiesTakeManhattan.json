I was looking for something fun and different and decided to give \"Zombies Take Manhattan\" a try.After reading it, I cannot give this book a high enough recommendation. It is made up of a series of interconnected short stories that tell about a zombie outbreak in New York City (not just Manhattan) and every single one of them is a ton of fun. The way the author weaves the characters and narrative in and out of the stories keeps things interesting. The only bummer was when it ended - I wanted more!If you like zombie stories with a lot of heart (and brains), interesting characters and some great humor, do yourself a favor and get a copy."}, {"userName": "N.E.

Funny, witty, and engaging, if you want entertaining zombie stories with character, read this collection. You won't be disappointed. I hope she decides to write more. I can easily see this turning into a long-running series."}, {"userName": "Robin S.", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20833374-robin-s", "userReview": "I do not like Zombie books. Let me repeat that. I. Do. Not. Like. Zombie. Books. I LOVED this! A collection of separate, but connected, short stories that bleed into each other. Fun read. Read this on my Iphone. Reading much of anything on an Iphone is a pain and I happily devoured this!"}, {"userName": "Helena Sheibler", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7804251-helena-sheibler", "userReview": "Great stuff, wish there was more. :)"}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17787531-daniel", "userReview": "Not bad , nice little collection of connected stories ."}], "description": "I 'HEART' New York!Five stories, one great city, and millions and millions of zombies.
