Ravens flew about among them, and clouds of dust hovered like halos around the hooves of their steeds. Wiping sweat from his brow, Tyrion spoke to yet another minor character you've never seen before. \"I hear that the Morvin and the Shornpel clans have sided with Darvus Farier from the great city of Bee Eff Eee, and are pushing forward late king Baratheon's bastard's scullery maid's uncle's melanoma as the true heir to the throne.\"The minor character chortled as he spooned up some of the newt egg soup. It had been spiced with cloves and the lightest touch of pepper, and leaves of cilantro floated like corpses upon its surface. Eating a side of braised elk spleen and a hunk of bread with a cheese sauce, the minor character said, \"If so, even more of the action is likely to shift away from the viewpoint characters, and THEN we'll see whether any of the characters from the first volume even make it to the final book, A Trample of Turtles.\" \"But,\" Tyrion pondered aloud, eating inch-long prawns from a trencher filled with a hot butter sauce, \"If the Starks send nine hundred of their men from the outer borders of ThatoneplaceImentionedOnce, and they move down toward the Lannister forces on Dragon's Fjord before the Lannister forces can unite with the Great Army of the Unwashed Men, perhaps they can defeat the bunjillion soldiers in the south now being ushered in the general direction of King's Landing by that one other guy. I can't remember his name. You know, the one?\"The minor character shrugged, tearing a piece from his bread bowl and dipping it into a small puddle of balsamic vinegar. \"You forget about the people beyond the wall, and the dragons in the east, and Bobbert, King Robert's mechanic. He now claims to have been conceived with the king's own cum, and thus has a claim to the throne.\"Tyrion scratched his chin. \"That does throw a new light on how convoluted things are becoming.\" They continued riding, their horses traveling gradually. More branches passed overhead. It felt as if the traveling had gone on indefinitely, and the audience was more than capable of empathizing. Tyrion munched on fresh radishes and drank a bold red wine from a skin hanging from his belt. The wine was rich, with plum flavorings and an oaky aftertaste. \"But,\" said Tyrion, suggesting another possible set of things that could happen. He made reference to an event that happened nine-hundred pages ago, but remembered it wrong, then postulated what the possible outcome could be. They rode onward. Minor Character munched on some pine nuts. SUDDENLY, SOMETHING EPIC WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!Chapter 2Eudaknow An Eudongivafuck, minor noble from Shelbyville, rubbed his temple, filled with anxiety at being introduced as a new viewpoint character 9,600 pages into the series. How would he live up to the amazing characters who had come before him and died so tragically? Perhaps because he had a valid claim to the throne, Having been the barista in King Robert's favorite coffeehouse. Yeah, that was the ticket. Riding his steed/ship across the desert/glenn/ocean/alley, he traveled gradually, wondering when he would arrive. Discussing with the others upon the ship, he theorized about possible outcomes of the conflicts in Westeros, all the while eating a succulent pomegranate, red juices running down his chin like he'd just been chewing on afterbirth. SUDDENLY, SOMETHING AMAZING WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN!Chapter 3The titties tittied, jiggling with much breastful bosomliness. The oiled girls with Brazilian waxes down below wrestled and licked each other's areolas, but it was only to help you become immersed in a realistic depiction of the ancient world. As the breasts bosomed with titful abandon, Tyrion ate shark flank. It had been buttered, cooked for twenty minutes at 345 degrees, then drizzled with a lemon sauce and allowed to cool for five minutes. The flavor was only mildly fishy, and Tyrion burped, taking another drink of the white zinfandel before digging into the raspberry crepes with a chocolate fondu. \"But still, Measter, you must understand the possibilities of that event rely on Stannis placing all of his trust in the moody lords of the upper northwest. They are known for being fickle and not holding to their oaths, and Stannis is more likely to try and seize the Port of Skulls. Will the king's ninth bastard even survive that battle? If so, at what cost to Stannis? Plus, what happens if the Lannisters and the Starks team up, and get Batman to join them, and Stannis can only get Iron Man? What then?\"Measter laughed at the dwarf. \"That may be, dwarf. You might be short and a dwarf, but you have a mind as sharp as a blade. But you are very tiny, in case that had escaped anyone's notice. Even so, if Stannis enlists Dumbledore, Gandalf and Belgarion, he will be more than a match for the team-up of Lannister, Batman and Stark. Even if they get Rocky Balboa and Wesley Willis on their side.\"Tyrion watched the boobs. \"But what about Joshua Lyman? Because he could totally take Dumbledore, and maybe Iron Man.\" Tyrion ate a lamb gyro, thinking back to the exciting thing that happened after the last chapter ended, thinking of it in an ambiguous and incomplete way. Since it had been 100 pages since his last chapter, you had entirely forgotten what the exciting thing at the end of the chapter was anyway, so it was not much of a loss. \"Well,\" he said, \"Now that all of the titties have jiggled sufficiently, we must needs be back on the road.\"They rode their steeds along a road, hooves raising up halos of dust, the ravens flittering about in the branches and saying what words they had picked up from the conversation. \"Death!\"\"Dumbledore!\"\"Titties!\"The half-man, who was short and a dwarf, wiped the sweat from his brow.SUDDENLY. . ."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1159787-valerie", "userReview": "Purchased anew, and laid it beside her bed,Conflicting thoughts flying through her head.Afraid almost to crack the covers, read the pages,What if it was the last book? \"No, More,\" she rages.What if it wasn't?

It only appeared in hardcopy so I can't link it.Since it's a national newspaper and many of the readers may never have read a fantasy book, let alone the first four in the ASOIAF series, the review is less about this book and more about the series and the author. I hope to make them the gift of a great reading experience. My rating for the book is set in the context of the alternative works of fantasy on the shelves rather than in an attempt to rank this volume amongst its predecessors (I would say signficantly better than A Feast For Crows - less good than the first three, still excellent)[Sunday Express review]By the time you reach the end of George Martin\u2019s A Dance with Dragons you will be nearly two million words into A Song of Ice and Fire, a sprawling epic fantasy series that is for many readers the single most defining work in the genre for a generation. A Dance with Dragons is itself over four hundred thousand words (one thousand printed pages), not that far shy of the whole of The Lord of the Rings or War and Peace - not that literary worth is measured on weighing scales.Martin\u2019s series, starting with A Game of Thrones, has been a slow-burning phenomenon, dwarfed only by the colossus that is Harry Potter. Right now all the volumes are on the Amazon top twenty list. When A Dance With Dragons was released in hardback last month it immediately became the fastest-selling fiction hardback this year in the UK.It has probably been the most anticipated (adult) fantasy novel ever published, helped of course by the recent excellent serialisation of the first book by HBO. A significant contribution to the anticipation has been the six-year wait since the last book, a source of controversy and teeth grinding amongst the readership. Internet grumbling about the delay reached such a pitch it prompted Neil Gaiman to blog to fans: \u2018George Martin is not your bitch\u2019. Whilst the books may roll out of the printing house on a conveyor belt, the words themselves cannot simply be squeezed out of the author by mounting pressure!So, has it been worth the wait? There was a five-year wait for book four, A Feast for Crows, and many fans felt the novel didn\u2019t fulfill the promise of the first three, making the critical success of book five the focus of still more intense speculation.Martin\u2019s success stands on the simple fact that he has brought to the fantasy genre the mature skills of realism, characterisation, and observation more commonly associated with literary fiction, and married them to a vivid and endless imagination. His commercial success derives from the fact that the books are addictively enjoyable. You don\u2019t need to be a reader of fantasy to enjoy Martin\u2019s work. Martin writes primarily about people. You will have fallen in love with, or at least be fascinated by, his characters long before you see your first dragon. By that point you\u2019ll believe in the dragon because you believe in the people through whose eyes you see it.A Dance with Dragons advances the story with more purpose and scope than its predecessor, reacquainting us with favourite characters (Tyrion, Jon, Dany, and Bran) we\u2019ve not seen since A Storm of Swords (2000). The story ranges across thousands of miles from icy wastes to dusty desert, expanding the incredible diversity of Martin\u2019s world, showing stories on the small scale (Arya\u2019s training) and the grand (Daenerys\u2019 realpolitik). And although the 1000 pages meander through many lives and situations, there are hints at the ultimate convergence and conflict of disparate story threads, a slow building sense of momentum, and finally a rising tension and pace that drives us breathless to the edge of several cliffs. One quote that stuck with me is \u201cA reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.\u201d And George Martin offers you a fair portion of those thousand right here.Turning the final page you can only be disappointed . . . to find it is the last, and you\u2019ll immediately want to reach for the next volume. And there maybe lies the rub.Edit - and 5 years later it's really starting to rub!Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes..."}, {"userName": "J.

At last the day had come. He stretched to work out the kinks in his joints and muscles and groaned at the throbbing in his head. On his nightstand lay a bottle of Dornish red, which he downed in one long swallow to clear his mind, wine dribbling down his beard and tunic. He spied the book at the corner of his room where he had hurled it, and nearly threw the bottle too as the rage resurfaced along with his senses.The book was called A Dance with Dragons, a book that he had vowed to write a review for to publish on Amazon.com. The ending had left him dazed and confused the night before, and he longed to leech the foulness from his blood in the form of a scathing review to warn others of the horrifying tedium that awaited them. But first...His bladder was full to burst, and he propelled himself to the privy to relieve himself of his heavy load. A steaming stream shot from his hose like the boiling vomit of a sick dragon; far more than what he had anticipated. He counted five and ten seconds gone by as he continued to shoot and spurt, and when it ended he sighed in satisfaction. He shook off the last drops and pulled up his smallclothes, mission accomplished, but what was this...His tummy rumbled.A dragon's roar erupted from his hind quarters, a sound that bellowed like the wet cheeks of thunder itself. The smell was revolting, and flakes of brown and bubbling slime oozed down his legs like gravy.\"Farts are wind.\" He chuckled, saliva running down his beard and undershirt.CHAPTER ONEHe opened his refrigerator to check its contents. He was hungry, and he was not going to write his review until he was full and sated. Much and more can be done in a day, and he wasn't about to rush himself.Within were foods beyond count and description, but he was going to try anyway. Two cartons of eggs sat at the top shelf, each carton containing sixteen shells filled with delicious yolk and white. On the shelf below there were meats of every kind: ham and beef and pork, bacon and roast beef and steak, enough to make his mouth water and his stomach jiggle with hunger winds. Yogurts dominated the third shelf of at least three different brands and ten different flavors. Orange juice, apple juice, grape juice, juice of every fruit and flavor. He would not go thirsty, mayhaps. There were also cakes of cheese and chocolate and strawberry short, as well as pies of apple and custard for when he tired of cake. Winter may come, but he would not go hungry. The bottom shelves were for vegetables, cabbages and carrots, broccoli and lettuce, tomatoes and...what...\"Neeps? What the hell are neeps?\" He shrugged.He broke his fast on fried neeps and bacon, scooping them up in week old hard bread that he hollowed out and used as a trencher. He tipped the delicious soup into his mouth, bits of neep and bacon grease running down his chin and robe. When that was done he ate the trencher too, the soggy crumbs clinging to his facial hair. He mopped up the excess grease with his beard, saving it for future consumption. If there was anything he hated more than procrastination, it was wastefulness.His review was in his mind. He yearned to write it, as that was his true purpose and he despised these bothersome distractions! But first, he had to travel. Surely there was plenty of time. Much and more can be done in a day, after all. Much and more.CHAPTER FIVEThe ship sailed down the river.In truth, he was not on a ship, nor was he in a river. But he had always longed to go sailing, and if he could, he would write about it incessantly and without restraint. But as of now, he drove a car, and while there was no river, there was a road, a long strip of gray asphalt that continued on to the vast horizon, leading to his destination, wherever that would be, and oh the Seven only knew when he would get there. The cement was cracked and the paint that divided it chipped and faded, mayhaps from age and use. The buildings passed by in a vague blur, but he could not pay attention to them now. He had to look ahead, or risk getting lost at sea. If I look left I am lost.Like the outstretched hand of a giant, a red light loomed before him, forcing him to stop in his tracks. There were three lights in all, red and orange and green. They played in sequence, herding the ships about like kings in an ocean court. He wanted to push on past that oppressive red god, but he knew to do so would be a one way ticket to the black cells. And the jail was dark and full of terrors.He could not afford to risk that, to be held captive for the tenth time like some onion smuggler. He had a review to write, and no time to waste. But he would get there, he assured himself. He only had to sail - drive - thrice more. But first comes the setup, and then he would put his pieces to play.CHAPTER THIRTY\"Good morning, sir. It's good to see you again!\"\"Hello, wench.\" He greeted. On the counter was an assortment of goods and food products. He had enumerated them in excruciating detail the chapter before, but he saw no reason not to do so again. Packs of lunchables were stacked like a mountain of prepared meals to lazily break his fasts on on the counter before him. Jugs of milk stood next to them, flanked by bags of cookies and crackers in varying brands and flavors. And oh R'hllord the cheese! Sliced cheese, round cheese, white cheese, blue cheese, string cheese and cream cheese. New pieces of hardbread were grouped to the side, of which he would use as trenchers when they become old and tough as rocks. And-\"That would be thirty-six fifty, sir.\", said the wench.\"What?\"\"Thirty six fifty. I rang them up while you were describing them. I like to pretend we're racing. I always win though.\" She smiled.\"Ah, I see.\" His eyes squinted at her, as if seeing her for the first time. Her hair was the color of straw and flowed past her shoulders and held in a band with a cute lion face (LANNISTER!) so as not to be obtrusive, culminating in a widow's peak at her hairline. Her eyes were like brown m&m's swimming in puddles of fresh milk. She wore a white blouse slashed with yellow with the top two buttons open. Her bosom was impressive, and on the left was a nametag.\"Darianne. Oh Darianne! How have I not noticed you before!\", he crooned.\"Um...I don't know. We see eachother everyday...you like to describe your purchases while I-\"\"Silence! Don't speak! You have awakened the dragon, and oh how he roars. I wish to sit for ten chapters straight and repeat your name! Darianne! Darianne! Darianne! And please, call me nuncle!\" Suddenly he shook his head, and his eyes focusing and his gut retracting, as if waking up from a terrible spell. \"No, I must not! I have a review to write, and these random romantic dalliances will only waste time!\" But as if succumbing to an invisible force that filled with extreme laziness, his eyes glossed over and his stomach spilled over his belt, and once again he was lost. \"Please, take me through your Myrish swamp!\"\"...\"CHAPTER 52 - 88\"Go Giants!\"CHAPTER 89It had been a long day, longer than the longest of books, longer than even the longest installments of the most epic of epic sagas. There had been many distractions along the way (through no fault of mine!), many foods to enumerate and much sailing - driving - to do, and he was contented to immerse himself in all of it. But the end had come at last; there was no more time for those distractions. It was time for the climax, and he must needs go with a bang. If there was actually anyone waiting, this was the moment they were waiting for.He sat in his chair, facing the computer screen, ready to write his review. The time was twelve and twenty, his cheek still stinging from the slap Darianne had given him, and his fingers flexed and ached to at last express what he felt after reading A Dance with Dragons. He glanced at the mirror hanging at his side, and for a fraction of a second he glimpsed the face of a rotund old man with a snowy white beard wearing a newsboy hat and an NFL jersey, who somehow reminded him of a greedy Santa. He shook his head. He must be weary from lack of writing.His fingers twitched over the keyboard, eyes glued forward at the screen. There was no shirking it now. The end would have to come. No more excuses. It was the end of the road. The final countdown. Duh duh DUHduh, duhduh duhduhDUH! The \"setup\" was complete, and his characters waited in place, ready to make their moves. This was the moment he had spent an entire day and one thousand figurative pages preparing for. At last the day had come. His beard smelled awful. A Dance With Dragons was...He wrote a word."}, {"userName": "Ser Nico", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3273115-ser-nico", "userReview": "Spoilers Included, so skip if you feel the need...So, it's like this. You like hotdogs. Hotdogs are your favorite food. And there's a jumbo hotdog coming out on the 12th, so yay. Come the twelfth, all you get is the bread, and they say, eat that, the sausage is coming. It's so meaty, you're already salivating, dribbling on yourself in public like a fool.Munch, munch, munch. But the bread is dry... Then you come upon a sausage factory. The Jumbo Sausage factory, and you get a grand tour, up and down every aisle, seeing the ins and out of sausage world, how they grind the meat, and all the health precautions and what-not. At the end of the tour, you get a frozen ketchup packet. Half the day is gone, and you've seen the jumbo sausage showcased in the window but all you get is dry bread and a ketchup pack that promises to melt in the next five to ten years. See how long-winded, pointless and totally irrelevant that was? It don't have nothing on ADWD. I used to like Tyrion, but he spent half the book rowing down a river, and the other half wiping a man's ass.Dany, reminds me of Brionny from Shadowmarch - clothes, food, suitors galore and loving servants willing to eat a sword for her. Dragons too, for about 50 pages, but mostly just food and tokars. Jon, hopefully dead. Yes, I said it. I used to like Jon, but he turned into a wilding-lover, an idiot, and a Stannis enthusiast. He knew nothing, Jon Snow.And those three make up 90% of the book.Theon was good, until the repetitive nature of his POV became boring.BTW, Aegon is still alive, which isn't really a shocker since the whole \"There must be one more\" vision, but we see him for all of five minutes. His bodyguard, the only truly interesting POV in the series gets two chapters. They are the only people who accomplish anything, and they do the majority off-page.One Jaime chapter, which was more pointless than Tyrion's stint as a pig-riding slave, if such a level of pointlessness is possible. The two Cersei chapters read nice, but are still pointless, (we've had enough introspection from her, right? Time for the trial/axman/exile).The whole thing is one massive filler that makes AFFC look like 5 star stuff.1000 pages plus? 90% based in Asia/Persia/Egypt/Greece/wherever the eff Meereen is supposed to be beside a cesspit. It's a literal cesspit... literally. That pale mare is going to leave its hoof prints on your soul. Raise your hand if you want the entire continent burnt to the ground! Who cares? I feel as if someone farted in my brain. And gave it the flux. Or if GRRM had the flux while he was writing this.Winds of winter though is poised to be beautiful, at least. Hopefully no more Wall, and no more Meereen, but I get a feeling we still have some \"Selmy's Round Table Rule\" to mock through.Victarion was in it, but he was on a boat too. Asha wasn't on a boat, but she was in the snow. Everybody was either in the snow, on a boat, or getting married and eating food.

This book was so bad. Not a single dragon danced once. I\u2019m so disappointed. Gosh! I may not even read the next one! You call that dancing? I\u2019m, of course, kidding. When the next book comes out I will devour it in an angry sort of way. It\u2019s been far, far, far, too long. Well, I should say \u201cif\u201d the next book comes out. But, let\u2019s not go there it is far too painful to think about. I\u2019m annoyed at the wait. I\u2019ll curse George R.R. Martin for leaving me in suspense, but I\u2019ll then praise his name whilst I\u2019m reading again.Enough of that, let\u2019s talk about this book. This really wasn\u2019t Dany\u2019s finest hour. It seems like everything she has created has fallen apart in her absence. Every Queenly decision she has made has backfired on her. Her people are angry with her; they\u2019re turning against her, and she can do little to prevent it. Here resides a massive flaw within her character. She has the strength to inspire, but she does not have the wisdom to rule effectively and efficiently. Her decisions are not constant. Some are governed by mercy and empathy whereas others are guided by cold logic and revenge. There is no sense of right or wrong anymore. She doesn\u2019t know what to do. Instead of governing by an effective amount of either, she governs with a touch of both which is completely detrimental to her rule. She looks like a foolish despot. What she needs is advice, what she needs is a friend; what she needs is some with the wisdom to help guide her compassion: what she needs is Tyrion Lannister. We all know is half way to her in this book. In the show he\u2019s already there. But, I can\u2019t wait to see it happen on the page. I can\u2019t wait to see him guide her back to Westeros, join up with the reanimated Jon Snow, kick some ass and join ice with fire. Well, that\u2019s what I want to see happen. Though in reality, something much more unusual will likely happen. What I want to see feels a like lot a typical plot line; it sounds like an obvious route for this to go down. George R.R Martin likes to be unpredictable, so it will probably end with something unforeseen, which will hopefully be better. I want to be surprised in the ending despite my investment with these characters.  Well, either way, I want to see Dany get the ending she deserves. I feel like she is the character who has, arguably, gone through the most; yes, all the characters have a rough time, but she has an especially rough time. She\u2019s got a lot resting on her shoulders. I\u2019m hoping she learns from her mistakes in Mereen, and uses them to benefit her possible rule is Westeros. Hopefully, she, with the help of Tyrion, will unite Westeros and destroy the Others. I did enjoy this book, and the one before it, though the plot didn\u2019t progress a great deal in either. It\u2019s quite worrying to think that this story could be concluded in two books. I mean\u2026.if it\u2019s another two like these two, where would that leave us?  A Song of Ice and Fire 1. A Game of Thrones- A life chnaging five stars2.A Clash of Kings- An Impish five stars3. A Storm of Swords - A Lannister loving five stars 4.  A Feast for Crows - A flat 3.5 stars5.  A Dance with Dragons-  A convoluted four stars 6.  The Winds of Winter- Will I ever read you?I think it\u2019s become far too big with unnecessary point of view characters. That\u2019s why I knocked my rating down a star; the book was very convoluted. I\u2019m hoping with the rest of the series there is a focus back onto the main characters. Well, at this point, I\u2019m hoping that this series actually gets an ending in the first place. As the years goes on it becomes less and less likely.

And why would someone give him an interesting storyline, so that I'd actually have to read them?Quentin Martell - what is the purpose of reading this?Asha Greyjoy - Stannis paired with an Ironborn makes everything grey and coldSome chapters make me incredibly happy, others curious and others again unbearably frustrated and annoyed. But now I'm left to wonder when we will get to read ASOIAF6.

Another one down! Each of these books are so incredibly long that it feels like a major accomplishment to complete them. I feel like I should get a merit badge or something.Nonetheless, this epic saga continues. While I didn't see a lot of forward movement, I appreciated the time spent with some of my favorite characters. Mr. Martin is not one to spare details, and this book is full of them.That being said, I spent a lot of time feeling lost. As if there weren't enough characters already, Mr. Martin continues to add even more side stories to this epic adventure. Maybe I'm missing something or just lack the insight to understand the workings of his brilliant mind, but I found many of these extra details to be trivial and irrelevant. I'm having enough trouble keeping the major characters straight. I certainly didn't need more added to the mix!Unlike book 4, this fifth book offers plenty of time with Dany and the dragons. This was a major plus for me, since Dany is my favorite character in the series thus far. I particularly enjoyed the way she finally embraces her dragons. I have an image in my mind of her flying through the sky on the back of her dragon that leaves me dying to get my hands on the next book.However, this book also showed the less confident side of Dany. She often struggled in her role as Queen, failing to make wise decisions. As her advisors have been whittled down, her ability to be the effective leader that she wants to be has declined. Many of the changes she implemented seemed to unravel in this book. Although, by the end of the book I had a renewed sense of optimism where Dany is concerned.'A Dance With Dragons' also features Cersei finally getting a taste of her own medicine. She is a character that I love to hate and seeing her brought down a few pegs was long overdue. If for no other reason, I would've read this gigantic book just to see her public humiliation and degradation. It was so worth it!Tyrion also reappears in this book. He's slowly making his way to Dany...and boy does she ever need him! Although his recent life events have made him even more aware of his expendability, he continues to be highly entertaining and incredibly wise.I am curious to see where this epic adventure is heading. It seems that these worlds are about to collide and I can only hope that my favorite characters don't begin killing each other off. Now that I've finished this book, I guess I can join the wait!As a side-note, I can say that the differences between the books and the HBO series are becoming more apparent the further along the series gets. Some of the events happen out of sequence and some things are added in that haven't happened yet. However, I'm still enjoying both immensely."}, {"userName": "Luca Ambrosino", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53478239-luca-ambrosino", "userReview": "ENGLISH (A Dance with Dragons) / ITALIANOThe fifth chapter of \"A song of ice and fire\" is yet another confirmation that George R.R. Martin, in the field of the epic-medieval fantasy, is the most worthy successor of J.R.R. Tolkien. The universe molded by Martin is described with a manic cure and with so many details that some readers are rather disappointed, accusing the work to be too long and/or boring. I do not agree. Game of Thrones has become what we today know exactly thanks to the painful precision of the author in painting the houses and the mechanisms that regulate their everyday life. The meticulous work done by Martin to draw up the genealogy of the main houses accompanying each volume recalls once again to Tolkien. At the moment, my reading experience is so immersive that I would probably guess the noble family of any new character only from the description of his ethics and behaviors. This means in my opinion that Martin has created a world, and he did it damn well.\u00abLife is not a ballad\u00bb the bitter thought of Theon the \"turncoat\", the outcast Geyjoy, beautifully contrasts with the fact that Game of Thrones is one of the most beautiful ballads that contemporary literature has given us.Lannister, Baratheon, Targaryen, Stark, Greyjoy, Bolton, Martell and many other houses continue their game for power constantly passing through alliances and betrayal, in which you can not trust anyone, not even your own children. The only voice out of the chorus is that of Jon Snow, who is not able to make everybody around him understand that there will be no Iron Throne to conquer unless the dark presence beyond the Barrier, the Enemy of all, will not be overthrown. Therefore, long life to George Martin. I hope he will leave his mortal coil at least in one hundred years. And not before finalizing A Song of Ice and Fire.Winter is coming. Aye.Vote: 8Quinto capitolo delle cronache del ghiaccio e del fuoco ed ennesima conferma che il successore pi\u00f9 degno di J.R.R. Tolkien in materia di fantasy epico-medievale \u00e8 George R.R. Martin. L'universo plasmato da Martin \u00e8 descritto con una cura maniacale, con una dovizia di dettagli che fanno storcere il naso a molti lettori, che accusano l'opera di essere lunga e/o noiosa. Non sono d'accordo. Il Trono di Spade \u00e8 diventato quello che conosciamo grazie alla morbosa precisione dell'autore nel dipingere le casate e i meccanismi che ne regolano la vita quotidiana, pi\u00f9 che gli eventi. Molto \"tolkieniano\" \u00e8 anche il lavoro svolto a stilare la genealogia delle principali casate a corredo di ciascun volume. A questo punto della lettura, la mia esperienza \u00e8 stata talmente \"immersiva\" che riuscirei probabilmente ad indovinare la nobile famiglia di appartenenza di un qualsiasi nuovo personaggio solo dalla descrizione che l'autore fa della sua etica e dei suoi comportamenti. Per me questo significa che Martin ha creato un mondo, e l'ha fatto bene.\u00abLa vita non \u00e8 una ballata\u00bb \u00e8 l'amaro pensiero di Theon, il voltagabbana, il reietto Greyjoy. Strano, perch\u00e8 Il Trono di Spade \u00e8 una delle pi\u00f9 belle ballate che la letteratura contemporanea ci ha donato.Lannister, Baratheon, Targaryen, Stark, Greyjoy, Bolton, Martell e tante altre casate continuano il loro gioco per il potere fatto di alleanze e tradimenti continui, in cui non ci si pu\u00f2 fidare di nessuno, nemmeno dei propri figli. Unica voce fuori dal coro \u00e8 quella del povero Jon Snow, che non riesce a far capire a chi gli sta intorno che non ci sar\u00e0 nessun trono di spade per cui combattere se non verr\u00e0 arginata l'oscura presenza oltre la Barriera, il Nemico di tutti. Pertanto, lunga vita a George Martin, che possa abbandonare le sue spoglie mortali tra cent'anni almeno. E non prima di aver terminato il Trono di Spade.L'inverno sta arrivando.

If the author had trouble writing it It\u2019s not surprising that it is also \u201cthree bitches and a bastard\u201d to read. Presumably the first 3 books were easier to write, I also found them far more enjoyable to read. I think part of my difficulty with reading ADWD is my refusal to skip anything, I never felt this urge to in the 1st 3 books. I read this today and thought it was very applicable, in his essay \u201cThe Art of Fiction\u201d Sommerset Maughm writes: \u201cThe wise reader will get the greatest enjoyment \u2026 if he learns the useful art of skipping. A sensible person does not read a novel as a task. He is prepared to interest himself in the characters\u2026 and what happens to them, he sympathises with their troubles and is gladdened by their joys. But he knows instinctively where his interest lies and he follows it as surely as a hound follows the scent of a fox. Sometimes, through the author\u2019s failure, he loses the scent. Then he flounders about till he finds it again. He skips\u201dMy interests are in Westeros, not in Mereen. I didn\u2019t feel the urge to skip in the Theon, Jon or Davos chapters. With Dany, Jon and Tyrion\u2019s character regression from the end of ASOS I have lost interest and sympathy with them. Its not a very plausible or thoroughly fleshed out setting, unlike Westeros with full family trees, coast of arms and centuries of history. As a reader I am floundering in these chapters because the author floundered in these chapters. Generally I can enjoy brilliant prose with zero plot. However Martin\u2019s excessive repetition of phrases is jarring. So to is his increasing use of inconsistent faux-medieval invented/adapted words (serjeant, neeps, needs must, nuncle) it does not make for good prose. In his 1st 3 books Martin avoided the fantasy tropes of unkillable farmboy saves the world. Now he has fallen victim of his own tropes, with comic-book like cliff-hangers at the end of every chapter and countless characters having soap-opera like resurrections. The realistic feudal medieval world of the early books is now replaced with an Orientalist flawed Eastern continent with none of the depth of the Westeros he created. Supernatural and fantasty elements are also prevalent, often as a tool for weak plot. Sadism, swearing and \"grimdark\" elements have also increased which is also in my opinion MArtin falling into his own tropes and not to the benefit of the prose or story.I have only just finished ADWD but others seemed to have finished very quickly, I suspect they skipped many Tyrion and Dany bits and probably found the whole experience more enjoyable. The Martin in the first 3 books is no longer the Martin of these last two. ADWD continues the drop in quality that came with FfC, I hope returns to enjoying writing the next 2 (or 3) so I can enjoy reading them again!"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt", "userReview": "This was a struggle between what I wanted to feel and what I felt. I\u2019m not going to lay false claim to being an early convert to George R.R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire cycle. To the contrary, up until April 17, 2011, I spent a great deal of time passively ignoring fantasy in general, and Martin in particular. (By passively ignoring, I mean I lived my daily life without ever thinking about the topic). However, on that date, HBO premiered Game of Thrones. Within three minutes, people were being decapitated, and my interest was piqued. I bought the first book, A Game of Thrones, finished it, and waited a couple days before ordering the second, A Clash of Kings. In the interim, I stopped eating, threw other, lesser novels in the trash, and started sporting a hobo\u2019s beard. When the second book arrived, I tore into it. By the time I reached the last fifty pages, I belatedly realized I needed to order the next installment, A Storm of Swords. (At this point I still thought I could kick the habit, and go back to a world where books that didn't feature castles, swords with names, and endless wine flagons could hold my interest). There was a daylong lag between finishing Kings and receiving Swords. During that 24 hour period, I experienced intense symptoms of anxiety, agitation, and sleeplessness. In other words, I went through the same withdrawal as your garden-variety crystal meth user. By the time I started Swords, the fourth book, A Feast for Crows, was already in the mail. Thus, I had a smooth transition between book three and four, which is to say that I stopped muttering I don\u2019t want to read other books ever again every time I looked at my bookshelf. Due partially to good timing, and partially to luck, I completed Crows shortly before the release of Martin\u2019s long-awaited fifth book, A Dance With Dragons. I went to work on the release date, signed out sick at lunch, drove to Barnes & Noble, and spent the rest of the day in Westeros. All this is to say that I was excited for the release of Dragons. Indeed, when I woke up the morning of the release date, I was in a state bordering on giddy; it may be worth adding that giddiness is not a state I visit often. Of course, my excitement doesn\u2019t hold a candle to the fervor of the true fans, the ones who\u2019ve been reading Martin since he first created A Song of Ice and Fire. The first three novels came out two years apart, starting in 1996. Following Swords, in 2000, however, the gestational phase for Martin\u2019s writing turned glacial. Crows did not come out for five years, and when it did, it landed with a thud. It had grown so large that Martin split the story in half; instead of dividing things chronologically, though, he did so by character. This meant that many fan favorites \u2013 Tyrion, Jon, and Daenerys \u2013 did not appear in Crows. Even worse, Martin stated in an afterward that the next volume \u2013 Dragons \u2013 would be arriving the next year.Six years later, that was true. So it\u2019s been six years since Brienne was left hanging by the neck at the end of Crows. And it\u2019s been more than a decade since we\u2019ve spent any appreciable time with the main triumvirate of Tyrion, Jon, and Daenerys. That\u2019s a lot of years for readers thirsting to know what happens next. Though I hadn\u2019t been there from the start, I counted myself among the insatiable.I counted down the days, checked Martin\u2019s blog, and when they started coming out, I read every early review, spoilers be damned. To a one, they were positive: Glowing. Effusive. Filled with praise. Yet almost all of them also had a but. \u201cIt\u2019s a great book, but\u2026\u201d \u201cFans should be totally satisfied, but\u2026\u201d When I finally started reading, the buts were the farthest thing from my mind. I\u2019m not what you\u2019d call an overly optimistic person; still, Martin had done enough to earn my trust. It took me till page 500 before a bit of doubt crept in; I did my best to suppress that. By page 700, the doubts had turned to a dull roar. On page 913, it hit me: nothing was going to save this experience. Dragons is a disappointment. More than that, it\u2019s a Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace-like disappointment. This is a book you want to like. No, that\u2019s wrong. This is a book you want to love. I\u2019m sure plenty of readers will love it. Or they\u2019ll say they did. I\u2019m just unsure how real that love is. The alternative is bleak: a six year wait only to discover that Martin blew it; that his story has spun out of control; that despite nearly 1,000 pages, the plot doesn\u2019t move an inch. I see now why the word but kept creeping into those reviews. The plot for Dragons picks up where Swords ended and runs concurrent (at least for the first half) with Crows (in an early scene, between Samwell and Jon, we are treated to a conversation held in Crows, though this time it is told from Jon\u2019s point of view, rather than Sam). As with all the other books in this series, Dragons is told from the third-person limited point of view, through the eyes of select \u201cviewpoint characters\u201d that alternate with each chapter. Back in Thrones, there were only eight viewpoint characters, which gave you depth without scope. That is, the limited points of view allowed you to become intensely connected to the featured characters; however, many of these characters were in the same geographical area, which meant that a lot of action took place offstage, and was related through exposition. At times, it was like looking at Westeros through a keyhole. In Dragons, there are a whopping sixteen viewpoint characters. This means you get great coverage of Martin\u2019s world. He has now put boots on the ground in every corner of the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. On the other hand, there\u2019s very little chance to grow connected to some of these newer additions. For instance, characters such as Areo Hotah, Victarion Greyjoy, and Quentyn Martell flit past so quickly, they barely register an impression.Right off the bat, Martin addresses the main criticism of Crows by treating us to successive chapters on Jon, Tyrion, and Daenerys. Indeed, these three comprise the bulk of Dragons chapters and length. Unfortunately, their mere inclusion is not enough to save the day. Of these three, only Tyrion is still mobile. Long regarded as Martin\u2019s greatest creation, Tyrion retains that distinction, if only because there are no other viable contenders. Tyrion, the Imp, is the dwarf son of a rich and powerful father, whom Tyrion killed in Swords. As always, Tyrion makes his way with a slashing wit, boundless confidence, and an unflagging desire for whores and booze. Part of Tyrion\u2019s appeal \u2013 which is testament to Martin\u2019s plotting \u2013 is that Tyrion is always dynamic. In Thrones, we underestimated Tyrion, who seemed a smart-assed, half-crippled bundle of hedonistic principles. In Kings, Tyrion was given a position of power, and used it wisely, displaying martial ingenuity along with flashes of humanity. By Swords, Tyrion\u2019s power had been stripped, and he was engaged in battle of wits with his sister and father. The result is that Tyrion\u2019s character has never settled; Martin has kept him on his toes, thereby engaging our interest. That holds true in Dragons. Following his escape from King\u2019s Landing, Tyrion embarks on a journey across the Narrow Sea, to find Daenerys Targaryen. I won\u2019t get into detail about his trek, as it contains plot spoilers. Suffice it to say, beyond the surprises and reveals, there are many nice moments to Tyrion\u2019s story, including a haunting boat ride past old Volantis, and a touching companionship with Penny, a fellow dwarf. Tyrion is still brash and funny and the bearer of a slightly-skewed moral compass. That I\u2019m beginning to tire of him probably has more to do with the fact that he\u2019s an old friend, and I\u2019m overly familiar with all his tricks and quirks. (Alas, Martin\u2019s attempt to frame Tyrion\u2019s quest as a way to find his place in the world is cringingly pat). Unlike Tyrion, Jon and Daenerys are rooted in place. Jon is on the Wall, where he remains throughout the entirety of Dragons. His conflict has to do with wannabe-king Stannis Baratheon, the red priestess Melisandre, and the hordes of wildlings that Jon has to resettle south of the Wall. The problem with Jon is that he\u2019s become a dull, stuffy hypocrite, in thrall to his own perceived rectitude. Despite spending much of Storms as a traitor, riding, eating, and sleeping with the wildlings (and by sleeping with, I mean boinking), Jon is still convinced of his own rightness. Throughout Dragons, his modus operandi as Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch is to stiffly inform Stannis that he is not allowed to help him; then he helps Stannis; and later, he rationalizes those actions to himself. This is repeated on a loop until the book ends. Meanwhile, Daenerys is stuck in Meereen with her army. The invasion that began with such promise in Storms has become a quagmire. While this may be a trenchant commentary on America\u2019s current military adventures in the Middle East, it creates a resounding narrative lull (about the only action in Meereen comes from the dragons, one of which gets loose and begins poaching children). Daenerys has chosen to stay in Meereen, despite all strategic advice to the contrary, because she wants to care for her people (whom she describes as \u201cchildren\u201d with queenly condescension). At a gut level, I disliked her for this stance. From the beginning of A Song of Ice and Fire, Martin has expounded on the theme of power and politics. Time and again, Martin has rewarded the purveyors of Kissingerian Realpolitik (such as Tywin Lannister) to the detriment of Stevensonian idealists (such as the late Eddard and Robb Stark). I spent much of Dragons annoyed with Daenerys for not making the tough, brutal, pragmatic choices that would allow her to win. Having given the notion a bit more thought, I realize that Daenerys actually deserves a bit of credit for having the most finely tuned moral sense of any other character. She is, after all, trying to help the poor, close the fighting pits, and free the slaves (even though Martin\u2019s other characters make such a persuasive case for slavery I got a little uncomfortable). Still, Daenerys\u2019 goodness is not a substitute for plot. As with Jon at the Wall, Daenerys\u2019 chapters are eye-glazingly cyclical: in each one, she is badgered to do something by an advisor or courtier; she gives a little ground while still holding to her principles; later, she is proven wrong; and the whole charade begins again. The other viewpoint characters are a mixed batch. The connecting theme with most of them is a desire to reach Daenerys in Meereen. The highlights include Bran, growing into his shape-shifting abilities; Arya training with the Faceless Men (and moving farther from the light); Ser Barristan Selmy at the twilight of his career, filled with regret yet still capable of kicking ass; and Cersei Lannister, who is forced to undergo an excruciatingly riveting trial by shame, which duly whet my appetite for her eventual vengeance. On the other hand, I don\u2019t care for the Greyjoys or the Martells. They were introduced too late into the series for me to have any profound connection. Moreover, their arcs and characterizations are uninspired. (There are two viewpoint characters for whom discussion would involve potential spoilers. Suffice it to say, one of these characters represents some of Martin\u2019s best work; the other embodies just the opposite).If it\u2019s not clear, my main criticism in Dragons is that nothing much happens. There is no action. It\u2019s a lot of people walking and talking and drinking and eating skewered meat. In other words, it\u2019s like a Renaissance Faire. But at least a Ren Faire has a joust. Here, in the midst of all that walking (and riding and boating) and talking, there are precious few battles, swordfights, fisticuffs or gratuitous sex scenes. I almost longed for a scene of depressingly low taste, such as the incestuous flirtation between Asha and Theon in Kings. To make matters worse, Martin (formerly a writer for The Twilight Zone) employs a cheap serial style that only serves to emphasize how little is happening. Each individual chapter follows the same general outline, just like a serialized drama. The viewpoint character is introduced; the character has a flashback that explains what he or she has been doing lately; the current narrative thread is joined; and finally, a conflict will arise. Just as something is about to happen, Martin will end the chapter with a cliffhanger. (One chapter ends with a character drawing his sword, just as a fight is about to start). This style is a huge miscalculation. After awhile, I became resigned to the fact that nothing would ever happen until the last page. Instead of action, I\u2019d be forever plunging forward, looking for a resolution that never came (or if it came, it\u2019d be so far forward in the book that I couldn\u2019t remember the cliffhanger to begin with). To be sure, Dragons is better than Crows. The writing is more sure-handed, unlike Crows which seemed carved out by an editor. Yet there is a distinct drop-off fromSwords. The descriptions aren\u2019t as fresh; the dialogue isn\u2019t as sharp; the plotting isn\u2019t as intricate. Maybe this is a function of the series\u2019 length, but cracks are beginning to show. I started to notice the clich\u00e9s, the lazy phrases, the writerly tics. For instance, in the span of two pages, Martin twice describes a character saying words that left \u201ca bitter taste\u201d in her mouth (in all my life, I\u2019ve never tasted a single word; apparently, this character feasts upon them). The dialogue, which once had a pulpy, almost Mamet-like pungency to it, has become pretty lousy. There are still some decent monologues, but the exchanges have devolved from evocative to exclamatory (and sometimes just lame; two different characters declaim that such and such a person is \u201cas useless as nipples on a breastplate\u201d). The leitmotifs, which used to be as simple and as elegant as \u201cwinter is coming,\u201d are now heavy-handed (\u201cwords are wind\u201d) or crude (\u201cwhere do whores go\u201d). Even the names have gotten worse. We used to have good, solid, muscular names, such as Bran or Ned or Robert or even the androgynous-yet-uncomplicated Jaime. Now, the reader is forced to make sense of unpronounceable collections of consonants and increasingly ridiculous aptronyms (Bloodbeard? Really?). (Anyone who doubts my qualitative critique of Martin\u2019s writing should find someone to read aloud to them from a Daenerys chapter. After a few sentences of stumbling over names and reciting exclamation-point-dotted sentences will prove my point). I don\u2019t think I\u2019m giving anything away by telling you there is a cliffhanger at the end of Dragons. By the time I got there, I didn't care at all. See, in Dragons, as in Martin\u2019s other books, major characters die. Or at least they appear to die. Back in Swords, Martin brutally killed off Catelyn and Robb Stark at the Red Wedding (and had Robb\u2019s decapitated body decorated by Robb\u2019s wolf\u2019s head). Since then, Martin has shown a preference for fake-killing his characters, tricking his readers into believing someone is dead before having that character reappear at a convenient moment. By this point, Martin has resurrected more people than Jesus. When people died in Dragons, I just shook my head and made my wagers as to when that person would show up. The biggest problem with Dragons is that it didn't fulfill what I needed it to fulfill. In other words, I set for Dragons an impossible task, and reacted with surprise when it could not complete it. Yet my expectations \u2013 and the expectations of millions of others \u2013 are part and parcel of Martin\u2019s grand enterprise. He set the bar very high for himself. It is becoming increasingly clear that he is wilting from that pressure. Instead of narrowing his story and focusing on its fundamentals, he has let the narrative explode. Instead of fine tuning plot points, he keeps throwing more plotlines into the mix. He\u2019s like some juggler who keeps adding pins to distract you from the fact that he\u2019s not wearing pants. The most damning indictment I can give Dragons is that I finished it a week after it came out, but didn't get around to the review until now. In those weeks, I have not missed it. Furthermore, I have not once thought about how long I\u2019ll have to wait until the next one. With his exceedingly long turnout time, Martin has set me up to stop caring. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be in five or six or seven years (it is a terrifying prospect to behold); still, I\u2019m pretty certain that A Song of Ice and Fire won\u2019t have a special place in my heart. Too many things will have happened. By that time, Dragons will be a distant memory: a book read by a different person in a different world. If the next book gets written, I may pick it up (or have it uploaded directly into my brain, if that\u2019s how things are done in the future), but it won\u2019t be the same experience.

It's wildly scattered all over the landscape of the current story, both in term of physical location and in terms of characters. There are so many new characters, new armies, new leaders, new kings, new slaves, new queens, and new vicious psychopaths that it's impossible to keep track of everyone, even if I wanted to. I know fans will say that's what the list of characters is for, but my *personal* attitude is that I don't like flipping back and forth in the book every time I forget who someone was four chapters ago. I feel as if the hole Martin got himself into when Danaerys chose to settle in one city rather than keep moving has expanded into a massive, unmanageable trap that it's going to be well-nigh impossible to write his way out of for any of the characters caught there. I feel the introduction of other contenders for her crown and the Iron Throne has pulled the story away from its central core and that most of this book could have been cut with no detriment to the main story at all. I feel the story's momentum has slowed to a complete crawl. Please don't yell at me for not loving the book or for questioning the series. This is my opinion, and it's the opinion of someone who's read the first four books twice. I've waded through a lot of gore, viciousness, woman-bashing, flaying, and cannibalism to get this far without a peep. (And please don't tell me there was a lot of rape in the middle ages. If that reasoning's going to be used, may I point out there weren't zombies, dragons, or White Walkers in the middle ages.) I do wonder if Mr. Martin isn't gaming the plot out, which at least would explain why it's gone so meander-y. Maybe it'll tighten up in the next book. I hope so.

I went nuts for the ever-more-elaborate mythology. And who doesn't like a climactic monster attack or a shocking character death? It almost didn't even matter how good a particular episode was, because it just gave you another chance to hang out in a story you loved, that fired your imagination. Even waiting for the next season was fun, to a point -- it gave you time to speculate about the plot in a way that you'd never bother to do if you could just pop in the next DVD.

Forget too that the only female POV characters (Cersei and Dany, and even Asha in her first chapter) can scarcely go two pages without pining lustily and pathetically for their male paramours. Don't trouble yourself with the chapters (Victarion, Davos) that could have been told more effectively in three sentence flashbacks in the next installment. And sure, one storyline features a character to whom we have never been introduced (Quentyn), forced to spend dozens of pages on, only to have that character fail to be an interesting character or a consequence to the larger narrative. So what?The larger issue is this: Martin has created a wondrous, fully-realized world in which many people (including myself) are happy to spend a great deal of time. He's just forgotten that he's supposed to be advancing a story within that world. Instead he spins his wheels. Nearly all the action takes place in a far-flung city operating within an alien (and uninteresting) civilization with a unique set of moral norms, with no apparent consequences for the people with whom we've already spent four books and 4000 pages with. Some characters don't advance at all from the beginning of this book's action; worse, some characters end up back where they began several books before. It's as if J.K.

A Feast for Crows \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605#readASOIAF Read-Along - Hosted by Riley from Riley Marie, Elizabeth from Liz Loves Literature, and Kayla from BOOKadoodles. \u2665A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons cover the same period of time, but split the characters and their points of view up. I've always chosen to read them back to back, but maybe people enjoy reading them simultaneously. If you would like to read them combined, here is the reading order: Link!\n\n\u201cNot all men were meant to dance with dragons.\u201d\n\nAt this point in the series, five books in, it would be almost impossible to talk about this book without heavy spoilers, so please do not read any further if you have not read this book or its predecessors. Okay, so on this reread, the prologue actually blew my mind. First, we learn it's a major no-no among wargs to skin change into other humans. You know, like what Bran has been doing to Hodor. Then, we find out the character in this prologue survives his human death by warging into his wolf. This is completely foreshadowing of Jon's fate at the end of this book. I mean, Melisandre tried to warn Jon of daggers in the dark, also, but like all Starks, he doesn't listen too well. Melisandre and her past is always hard for me to read. People always view her as this sex symbol from the show, but she has such a deeper, and sadder, past in the books. One of the things I look most forward to in this series is seeing her development and what she makes of her trauma. Oh, and seeing if she ends up resurrecting Jon, like in the show. I can't wait to see how important Ghost's role really was with bringing Jon back. \n\n\u201cThe strongest trees are rooted in the dark places of the earth. Darkness will be your cloak, your shield, your mother's milk. Darkness will make you strong.\u201d\n\nEven though Melisandre is marching with Stannis and his men to see if they can defeat the Boltons so he will be one step closer to winning the throne, my favorite points of view were from Asha Greyjoy. Like, besides the fact she is a super strong woman, she represents how unfairly some people are treated just because of what gender they were born. Again, I know a lot of people read this series and deem it sexiest, but there are so many feminist themes throughout, and Asha is such a wonderful example that I can't help but root for. And Asha's conversations with Alysane Mormont, while marching with Stannis' army, just further proves the theory from A Storm of Swords, that Tormund is the father of Lyanna Mormont!Meanwhile, on the Bolton side, Ramsey is really trying to out-do Euron for my most hated ASOIAF villain. The chapters inside of Reek/ Theon's head were some of the most disturbing things I've ever read. I know Reek/Theon did some terrible things, but no one deserves the karma he has been dealt at the hand of Ramsey. \n\n\u201cWhen you have known the kiss of a flaying knife, a laugh loses all its power to hurt you.\u201d\n\nAlso, if I were Jeyne Poole, Sansa's old friend, I would have been singing at the top of my lungs that I wasn't Arya, even if that meant my death, because Ramsey is that much of a sick fuck. Cersei's chapters were my favorite. Unlike Ramsey, her \"villainous ways\" make so much sense to me. Most mothers will do anything for their children, and Cersei will literally do anything. All her actions, both filled with hate or filled with love, are all because of what she thinks is best for them. There is something pretty endearing about that, and her chapters were honestly the best in this book.\n\n\u201cI am Cersei of House Lannister, a lion of the Rock, the rightful queen of these Seven Kingdoms, trueborn daughter of Tywin Lannister. And hair grows back.\u201d\n\nMy favorite part of this whole book was when Cersei was reflecting upon the events that have happened recently, and was so remorseful thinking about how differently everything would have been if only Joffrey didn't kill Ned in A Game of Thrones. It is crazy to think about how one terrible and thoughtless act can ruin so many lives. It is actually pretty heartbreaking. I very much loved rereading Tyrion's point of view, again! Oh, how I missed him! I completely forgot about Penny, but re- fell in love with her, too! Penny, Tyrion, and Jorah's journey in this book sure wasn't an easy one. Especially for Jorah, even though I low-key hate book Jorah. Dany's point of view starts with her being unable to control her dragons, but ends by leaving lot of mystery to where she will end up. I know that we have an unfair advantage with the show maybe being book-cannon, but I'm really looking forward to her meeting with Tyrion in The Winds of Winter. Like, I'm really, really, really looking forward to it.And I obviously want a Stark meet-up more than anything. Bran is learning so much from the three-eyed crow, and him being a greenseer. I have always loved the children of the forest, and it was a joy reading about them again. Especially Leaf <3. I'll be honest, for some reason I wasn't enjoying this book as much as the previous four. I'm not sure if I just burnt myself out on ASOIAF by rereading a book a month or what, but I felt more determination to finish than enjoyment while reading. Obviously this series is in a league of its own, and deserves five stars because of the masterpiece that it is, but I'm happy to now tunnel my enjoyment into waiting for the release of The Winds of Winter.\n\n\u201cA reader lives a thousand lives before he dies.

Daenerys's empire is threatened from within. Tyrion finds himself enslaved. Cercei finds herself in chains. The Crow's Eye desires Daenerys for his own but so do several other would-be suitors. And Jon Snow faces dissent from his brothers of the Watch...In the latest installment of Incest and Intrigue, more of the pieces are placed on the board. Daenerys can't trust anyone. Jon Snow can't trust anyone. Iron Lords cannot trust their own brothers. Sellswords in general cannot be trusted. In short, no one can trust anyone while the Game of Thrones is being played.This one had its share of memorable moments, both good and ill. I really like how Arya's story is developing but I don't see how it's going to tie back into things. The revelation of Young Griff's true identity was a game changer and its repercussions will be felt in the next couple books. I liked that Brienne is still alive and that Jaime Lannister chose to follow her instead of rushing to Cercei's defense. Jon Snow getting knifed on the Wall by his sworn brothers didn't sit well with me. I'm really hoping he's still alive come next book, whenever that may be.It looks like Theon is headed for redemption but I'd rather see him dead or taking the black. Bran is progressing nicely. Whatever happened to Ricken and that bastard of Robert's that isn't Gendry? And who is Cercei's new champion Robert Strong, the Mountain, perhaps? Barristan rose a couple notches in my estimation. I'm hoping he continues to draw breath in subsequent books.I honestly don't think Martin will be able to wrap things up in two more books, not with all the balls he has in the air. Plus, it would be all too easy for him to throw more players into the mix to keep the saga going indefinitely. Still, with A Song of Ice and Fire, George R.R. Martin has made an Oathbreaker out of me. I once swore I'd never get caught up in a neverending fantasy series. In fact, I believe I said I'd rather eat my own testicles. However, I'm pretty caught up in this one. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to join the tent city on George R.R.

Full of deceit and wrong decisions that lead to consequences beneath a human being's capability to accept. Never a dull moment with George R. R. Martin, another masterpiece.I could talk about the plot and characters for days if I wanted to, but I'll try my best to make this review as short as possible.\n\n Kindly note that this will contain spoilers! Don't read beyond this part, unless you're a person who actually likes reading spoilers. \n\nSo after the  short  break of the major characters from book four: A Feast of Crows, they now return, more than ready to scar the readers in different ways possible. \nTyrion Lannister!! \n continues to be the humorous man that he is. Right from the start of this novel, he showed humor already, with his endless rant of wanting more wine. I can't really say that he further developed, as he's already a fully developed character. There's no more space for us to like this character even more. The only possibility is that we  might  hate him in the next novel. Not hoping for that to happen though. For now, I don't see a bright future for the glorious imp, but you know George R. R. Martin, he has some tricks up his sleeves.\nDaenerys Targaryen!!\n I know that I'm not the only one who likes her, but I will be one of the few who will say that she has fully developed in this novel. Unlike Tyrion who has fully developed from book 1 or 2. I can't really say that she became a  strong  queen though. She made questionable choices, and let her heart rule her judgment. I expected better from the mother of dragons, but there's still more room to grow even further. her point-of-view in this novel was my second favorite, next to Jon Snow's. Obviously were no dull moments with Daenerys in this one. Readers, like me, wanted to know her decision in, well, everything. Be it choosing her future king, or the well being of her beloved dragons. The really exciting parts were evident in the second half of the book though. Right from when her dragon  burned  her, or her hair, and she rode on it and flew off. Some people believed she was dead, but she ended up  deserted  on an island. Then she meets Khal Jhaqo in the very end of the book (excluding the epilogue), so that's really something to look forward to!\nJon Snow!!!!!\nNow we're talking about my favorite character of the series alongside Tyrion and Daenerys as of right now (thanks to George R. R. Martin killing my other favorite, Robb). The Lord Commander of the Night Watch. Clearly he had one of the biggest responsibilities, and he made such bad decisions. Right from the start I already feared that something bad was going to happen. Aside from easily trusting people, he also neglected Ghost. Ghost was a huge advantage to him, and clearly he didn't use him as much as he needed to. The result? Four stabs. Four fucking stabs. And he didn't listen to Melisandre, the woman who kept warning him that something bad was going to happen. Freakin' daggers in the night! His future was foreseen, damn it Jon, next time listen to the woman. I know that Melisandre misinterpreted some information, but damn it Jon, now I think you're dead. I got mad, then got sick. I got the death hangover sickness. I didn't want any of my favorites to die anymore, but clearly I concluded without the author confirming. So I ended up hating the author till the end of the novel, but when I was reading the character/house list in the end, I saw that Jon didn't have the { } in his name, so there's hope! And I heard rumors that the author hinted that he's alive. There's hoooope! But, if he is alive, he clearly needs to get his shit together. Rely on Ghost more Jon, as he's my favorite Direwolf of the six.\nReek!\n Yes, that supposed minor character Reek. Very amusing man, in fact, in some parts he was more amusing than Tyrion! But, at the same time, in some parts he was clearly disgusting. But hey, he is living up to his name, Reek! With the constant finger chopping and skin peeling, his chapters were very entertaining! I liked the brutality that the author's trying to slowly mix in. Who would've known that the Theon Greyjoy would end up being a wimp that was Reek? But in the end he's slowly became the old Theon Greyjoy, and I liked that. I used to like Theon Greyjoy a lot!\nCersei Lannister!\n What an amusing woman to read about! She also became one of my favorites during book four, as the novel kind of revolved around her. Such a cruel fate to a cruel woman, truly deserving. Shaving all of her hair in her body, and  marching  naked was clearly a huge punishment condemned by Tommen, her son. We all know that Queen Margaery's influencing the young king. Two queens fighting, and the younger one's winning. To wrap things up, this was another amazing novel by George R. R. Martin. No, I'm not just going with the hype and saying this was one of the best novels I've read. I'm very frank about my opinion of a novel, and if I hated it, you'll hear about it. This was clearly not one of those hated novels. The length didn't bother me anymore, as I'm used to it already. Thanks to your first four gigantic novels Martin, I now read huge novels. So 5/5 stars and this has been added to my favorites list, if those were not enough to make you read this book, or this series to begin with, then something's wrong with you. Let's just hope that it doesn't take Martin forever to finish the next novel. It's only been an hour since I finished this, and I'm already yearning for more."}, {"userName": "ambyr", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2670408-ambyr", "userReview": "I don't know how to objectively review this book.I first found Westeros in high school--sophmore year, to be exact. I'd had A Game of Thrones for months, maybe a year. I think it was a present. I kept opening it, reading a few pages, and bouncing off. And then one day I was bored and didn't have anything better to read and I finally forced my way through the prologue (which I still hate, and skip on rereads) and fell head-first into the book. When I came up for air, I demanded my parents take me to the bookstore so I could buy A Clash of Kings, even though it was only out in hardcover and I was young and broke.I needed to know what was next. I'd never found books that so perfectly combined hard-edged politics with an air of the numinous. But it was more than that--I needed to spend more time in this world, with its history and mythology and people and landscapes and food. There's a picture of me reading Clash in my high school yearbook, hunched over on the school bus and oblivious to everything and everyone, including the camera flash.When A Storm of Swords came out, I ordered it from amazon.uk rather than wait an extra three months for the U.S. release. I did the same for A Feast for Crows, even though the difference was a mere three weeks. There's no question I would have done the same for A Dance with Dragons, if the option had been available.It doesn't matter that I find many of the characters objectionable, and not just the villains but also the heroes. (Die in a fire, Tyrion.) It doesn't matter that the Orientalist descriptions of Essos send my eyebrows crawling up to my hairline. It doesn't matter that the sex scenes are cringe-inducing and that all the female characters are written through a male gaze. It doesn't matter that Martin desperately, desperately needs a better line editor--or to listen to the one he has and avoid using the same phrase ten or twenty times in a single book.All that matters is that Westeros is home, and I will always be grateful to return to it.Even a week after finishing, I don't know what to say about Dance. Parts of it dragged (Dany). Parts of it flew all too quickly (Davos). Parts of it were deeply satisfying (Theon), and parts of it were enraging (Tyrion). All of it made an impression. All of it stirred a reaction.Was it a good book? Hard question, because it isn't a book. It's part 5 of X of the ongoing Book of Westeros, and it pretends even less than the previous volumes to have a contained storyline, to have a beginning and a middle and an end. I think it could have improved on that aspect; I am sorry it was rushed to press so quickly, because I think better editing could have produced a better-shaped book, with less repetition and more sense of emotional climax. (I don't necessarily think it needed more battles. Theon's final scene, Jon's, Dany's--those were all climaxes, even if they weren't filled with fire and blood. Even Cersei, to an extent. And I'm okay leaving Bran and Arya mid-training. But I thought the ends to Tyrion's, Victarion's, and Jaime's stories were bizarrely abrupt.) I still think it was a worthy addition to the series.But oh, god, the line editing. By the end of Dance, the \"much and more,\" \"little and less,\" \"words are wind,\" \"he was not wrong,\" and wroth/wrath confusion were so grating, and so prevalent, that I was stopping every two or three pages to close my eyes and cringe. I can forgive a lot--the racism, the misogyny, the endless meandering travelogues--as long as I'm allowed to sink into the world of Westeros. Redundant prose is like a hand constantly jerking me back to the surface. Please. Please. Be better in the next book."}, {"userName": "C.G.

Yet, no matter what bad things he has done or have been done to him, he still tries to maintain his humanity. Plus, he\u2019s funny as hell.Characters that are two sides of the same coin - Jon Snow and Daenarys. It\u2019s obvious why Martin kept these two character chapters back to back. Each was dealing with the reins of power in their own way. Daenarys as Queen was the more believable of the two. She was driven by her heart and by her need to do what\u2019s best for her city. She had advisors that she made use of. What she did and how she did it made sense in Martin\u2019s world.As for Jon Snow, what knowledge base was he drawing his decisions from? Did he have a copy of Lord Commander of the Wall for Dummies that he referenced? He acted like he\u2019d been doing the job for years. Wasn\u2019t he like 14 or something?Character I would have loved to take to the prom \u2013 Asha GreyjoyCharacter I did take to the prom \u2013 Brienne of TarthCharacter I would ask to help me move \u2013 (a tie) Hodor, Wun Wun. Ah, Hodor, be a good fellow and put the refrigerator over there. Wun Wun, careful with that grand piano, lad.Character who deserves a punch in the face (if not more than that) \u2013 Theon, Reek, or whatever clever chapter heading Martin came up for him. Beyond annoying.Character that should have a big flaming bag of dragon poo dropped off at his castle door \u2013 Stannis. What a wet blanket.Character I\u2019d like to grab a beer with \u2013 Tormund Giantsbane, he\u2019s fun, would have lots of cool stories and drink me under the table. One of the spearwives could be the designated driver.Sea faring character that put Bluto to shame \u2013 Victarion Greyjoy. Dude, harsh."}], "description": "In the aftermath of a colossal battle, Daenerys Targaryen rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way east\u2014with new allies who may not be the ragtag band they seem. And in the frozen north, Jon Snow confronts creatures from beyond the Wall of ice and stone, and powerful foes from within the Night\u2019s Watch. In a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics lead a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, to the greatest dance of all.", "title": "A Dance with Dragons\n      \n          (A Song of Ice and Fire #5)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18626828-a-dance-with-dragons", "average": 4.31, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1383741703l/18626828.jpg", "reviews": 20730, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/346732.George_R_R_Martin", "name": "George R.R.
