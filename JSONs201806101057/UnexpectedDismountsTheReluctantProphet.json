I've not read many, if any, books that so clearly demonstrate what following Christ truly means as this series does. Unexpected Dismounts continues the story of Allison as she follows the Nudge God gave her, leading her to buy a Harley and open a home to help prostitutes begin a new life. Now she is facing some rather daunting challenges (some \"unexpected dismounts,\" as they call them in the world of Harleys) and other than one new Nudge (which God must surely intend only to be followed in a theoretical, as opposed to literal, sense!) she finds Him to be rather silent. There's nothing quite like going out on a limb with and for God and then feeling like you're stranded there. . . .especially when almost everyone around you pretty much thinks you're crazy for being there in the first place! Including those who profess to be Christians, who just want Allison to get over this phase and get back in her pew and behave like a \"normal\" Christian. Allison must decide which is worse: for people to judge her for hearing and following God's voice, or for her to decide the cost is too great and close her ears and her heart to His nudges. Nancy Rue has definitely heard some nudges of her own in writing this series. This is not your typical \"safe\" Christian fiction. But come to think of it, the Christian life was never guaranteed to be \"safe.\" From a strictly literary sense, this is a phenomenal book. Several times as I read, I stopped and thought, \"where does she come up with this stuff?!\" The characters and the interactions between them are so well-done that I truly felt as if I might encounter them in real life. But the spiritual dimension utterly transforms it from simply a \"good read\" to one that will challenge you to follow the Nudge that God is giving you. Don't miss this book and this series."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3525770-diane", "userReview": "Nancy Rue is rapidly becoming one of my favorite authors. This sequel to the Reluctant Prophet followed the theme of service to the \"least of these\". This time the \"Nudge\" is not to buy a Harley--it's to wash their feet.

Cook takes us back into the life of Allison Chamberlain.From the Back Cover: Allison Chamberlain thought she was doing everything God required of her\u2014but as her journey continues in the second book of The Reluctant Prophet series, she might have to let go of everything she loves to follow the call. Allison is already taking care of five former prostitutes, trying to adopt an orphan, and helping a woman who\u2019s been raped. Along the way, she experiences unexpected dismounts, as every Harley owner who risks the ride eventually does. A relative challenges the adoption. An influential businessman blocks her ministry. A beloved friend is seriously injured. A piece of her past adds even more turmoil. As she picks herself up again and again, Allison realizes that some are guilty of terrible wrongs\u2014but everyone must be responsible for righting them.The Church was never meant to be a safe place. It was designed to be a hospital where the wounded and broken could come to get rest, healing and be tended to. That was Jesus in action. He dealt with sinners, sick persons, prostitutes and demon-possessed individuals. In \"Unexpected Dismounts\" Nancy Rue gives us a story that shows, through the life of Allison Chamberlain, what the Church is all about. Ms. Rue provides the themes of bikers, prostitutes and adoption. It is quite a book.If you would like to listen to interviews with other authors and professionals please go to www.kingdomhighlights.org where they are available On Demand.To listen to 24 hours non-stop Christian music please visit our internet radio station www.kingdomairwaves.orgDisclosure of Material Connection: I received this book for free from Jeane Wynn at Wynn-Wynn Media for this review.

Too much action--too many characters introduced to keep a storyline going...some which simply seemed to be compact little stories of their own: a raped prostitute, a child-custody battle interrupted at the 11th hour by a long-lost aunt, freaky motorcycle accidents tied to a mysterious one-eyed creep thought to be dead. Oh, and the rich old lady who can't commit a donation to fund a second Sacrament House...so many stories that could have been removed leaving the main story intact. In fact there was so much going on, it really wasn't until the final chapters that I realized that the whole build-up was to reveal a long-held vendetta. And then the plot became silly. When the child given-up for adoption turns up and \"coincidently\" becomes the lawyer come-to-town-to-save-the-day...well, it began to feel like an episode of DALLAS. Allison Chamberlain began to take on the persona of a long-suffering soap opera character.The confession of arch-enemy, Troy Irwin, was, unfortunately, the lowest point...because of the melodrama. On page 424 Troy asks Allison, \"Do you know why I raped that girl?\" Now come on. What psychopath calls his crime by its actual name? What sociopath--as Troy Irwin has been painted to be in the previous 423 pages--is going to admit to any wrongdoing, much less rape? \"I'll tell you why,\" he continues midway down the page. A confession...really? What psycho confesses to his crimes? especially a confession to the one he is bent on bringing down? \"I did it to show you that you are never going to change things.\" Oh, the drama, the angst, the raw pent-up emotion. It's there...it's just not believable. It feels as if it were written for effect, not for truth.Hoping that the final book of the series, TOO FAR TO SAY ENOUGH, brings back some of the honesty of one caught up in unexpected, undesired service to God."}, {"userName": "Sally Ferguson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25294957-sally-ferguson", "userReview": "Set in run down neighborhoods of St. Augustine, Florida, an unexpected messenger from God sets out to correct the ills of society. By becoming an advocate for drug addicts who are trying to get off of the street, Allison Chamberlain finds herself on both sides of the law. Unexpected Dismounts, by Nancy Rue, tackles unusual plot themes of bikers, prostitutes, adoption, and Nudges from God. Wrap those themes up in street lingo and biker slang, and you\u2019ve got an education coming that puts you right in the middle of a different world. Although a work of fiction, Rue\u2019s characters were so consistent, they took on a life of their own. The point of view came from Allison\u2019s own questions about people and their motives. And the emotions of doubt, fear and mistrust toward people and God were real-life snippets of our own tug-of-war with faith. I came away from the book feeling a kinship to people for whom I had not previously been able to relate. And it was refreshing to watch someone stretch in her understanding of God and His desire for her place in the world.If you pick up this book in the middle of the trilogy, like I did, you may have difficulty following the characters at the beginning.

CookOctober 2011ISBN: 978-1-4347-6492-8Genre: women\u2019s fictionAllison Chamberlain thought she was doing everything God required of her. She is mentoring five former prostitutes and trying to help orphans. And coping with unexpected feelings. But now she\u2019s experiencing UNEXPECTED DISMOUNTS. A distant relative challenges an adoption Allison hopes for. An influential businessman tries to stop her prostitute ministry. A piece of her past elbows it\u2019s way in. As Allison picks herself up over and over again, she realizes she might have to give up everything she loves just to stay upright. UNEXPECTED DISMOUNTS is the second book in her The Reluctant Prophet series. The first book The Reluctant Prophet should be read first in order to fully comprehend what is going on in UNEXPECTED DISMOUNTS.The story is written in first person, which doesn\u2019t appeal to all readers, and starts with celebrating Lent, a practice not all Christians (or prostitutes, in the case of UNEXPECTED DISMOUNTS) engage in. Allison is caring, wanting to help others. I did find the cast of characters confusing. There seemed so many introduced at once. But it\u2019d been a year since I read the first book and The term prophet in this series isn\u2019t used in the biblical way, but instead as someone who teaches others how to get right with God.

Unexpected Dismounts is the second in her series about Allison Chamberlain, a woman who was raised with privilege but has chosen to turn her back on the corrupt world she came from to rescue prostitute from the life of abuse they lead. Riding a motorcycle, she traverses the streets of St. Augustine, Florida following God's plan for her life.
