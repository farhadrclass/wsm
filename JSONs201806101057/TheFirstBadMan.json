There's all these bizarre jerks and twists and feints that are completely implausible until they happen, and you open your mouth to protest but Miranda just says shh shh shh, it's going to be fine and somehow it is. Despite being, plotwise, so bonkersly unlike anything you have ever thought of before, I don't mean to suggest that it's absurdist or surreal or Naked Lunch\u2013ian or anything like that. It's normal people doing things that are only a beat or two off of normal; you just have to go with it, and then before you know it it has become perfectly reasonable and you're on to the next thing. And in fact it is also an absolute astonishment of meticulous construction, one you don't even ever see coming. All the pieces fits so bizarrely & perfectly together\u2014click, click, click, like they're magnetized. I realize this is very vague and obfuscating but the book isn't coming out for like six months and I don't want to be a spoilery asshole. So here is a teaser list of things you will find in this book; I know it won't make much sense probably but oh well: role-playing therapists, appallingly selfish shirking of parental and grandparental duties, self-defense as fitness, globus hystericus, sexual-preference fluidity, May\u2013December romances, a sort of two-person female Fight Club, a bucket of snails, simultaneous baby reincarnation, chromotherapy, the most awkward sex ever and also the most compellingly, disturbingly sexy masturbation fantasies.Sorry, that's all you get. I loved this so so so much and you will too. Good luck with the wait. : )"}, {"userName": "christa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40816-christa", "userReview": "Typically when I don\u2019t like a buzz book I delight in mocking word choices and flimsy chapters or the thin line separating the novel\u2019s plot and the author\u2019s bio. The book becomes a contender for worst-of-the-year and I quietly, okay not-so quietly, dare someone, anyone to write something worse. When I don\u2019t like a book by Miranda July, my second inclination is to assume that there must be something wrong with me. I adore Miranda July The Artist and all the weird shit that brews behind those slightly alarmed-looking eyes. I was with her that time she did that social experiment involving the Penny Saver and I was with her when she made the movie that included a talking cat. I downloaded her app (until I needed the storage space) and I subscribed to the Email Project. But sometimes I\u2019ll just be walking along and I\u2019ll think of the short story from her collection \u201cNo One Belongs Here More Than You\u201d that starred a woman who taught land-based swimming lessons in her living room and I\u2019ll kind of shake my head because that one still doesn\u2019t make sense and even kind of bugs me. In July's \"The First Bad Man,\" Cheryl is a socially awkward 40-something who works at a non-profit that has recently rebranded its self-defense how-tos as fitness videos. She quietly pines over a 60-something board member who is always saying asshole-y things to her, which she assumes is done in an ironic way. She\u2019s honed her home life to a smoothly-run operation built around the optimization of her every movement. She understands that if things get lax, if dishes pile up, it\u2019s the fast track to depression which ends with peeing in mason jars. Phillip, the board member, seems to be returning her affections, but really he is just warming her up to confess that he has fallen in love with an underaged girl but that he hasn\u2019t yet consummated the relationship and he won\u2019t -- unless Cheryl gives the okay. As he waits for her to decide if it\u2019s okay, he sends her status updates on the sexual side of things: The girl has been rubbed through the jeans. She\u2019s held his stiff member. That sort of thing. Meanwhile, Cheryl ends up sharing her home with Clee -- her bosses\u2019 big blonde daughter who is supposed to be looking for work in Los Angeles. Things are a bit contemptuous on the Clee-to-Cheryl front, and eventually the former is waging physical attacks on the latter -- which Cheryl combats by turning these go-rounds into reenactments of the Open Palm video series. Then it starts to get pant-y between them -- though Clee\u2019s foot odor is a bit of a bonerkiller. Through all of this is a situation with a therapist who plays a receptionist as a twice yearly bit of role playing, and Cheryl is drawn to certain babies who speak to her on a cellular level. And there are the regular texts from Phillip, which she uses in her super rich fantasy life. At first I was ambivalent. I\u2019d moved past caressing the cover and dug in deep to find that \u2026 well, it wasn\u2019t screaming to me every time I set it aside. Then I actively hated it for a while. This ugly period faded and I had a sort of-kind of renewed interest that morphed into something along the lines of This is a Book with Words in it That I am Reading For Now. The End.In the meantime, everybody is loving this book. Lena Dunham posted a photo of herself holding a copy and she credited July with being \u201cfresh.\u201d New York Times likes it, though the reviewer sounds like she\u2019s trying to convince herself along with Book Review readers, Boston Globe, AV Club, etc. To not like this book feels like an inadvertent admission of a character flaw. The opposite of a humble brag. It\u2019s not July; It\u2019s me. Writing about this book and talking about it with other readers has made me question my own judgement. It sounds funny. You\u2019re right Lena, it does sound fresh! There are great lines, there are interesting ideas about relationships and the characters are truly unique. It is, I believe, even pretty funny. The problem: It\u2019s not fun to read. The characters\u2019 actions are nonsensical. The plot twists aren\u2019t compelling. When a character gobbles at her placenta like it\u2019s leftover spaghetti I rolled my eyes so hard I almost pulled a forehead vein. I\u2019ve defended July against this in the past, but this time it\u2019s true: Quirky for quirky sake. The worst kind of quirky.

Bizarre is a good way to describe it. The main character Cheryl - mid 40's - faces anxiety with disturbing sexual fantasies. She suffers from OCD and is mentally unstable.

Literally every single of those \"Reads to Look Out For in 2015\" lists has had this one near the top. I must admit that this is my first experience with July's writing. I know she has some short stories floating around somewhere so I'll catch them eventually. So, is The First Bad Man deserving of the hype? Yes. Or no actually. No, yes. Hmm. Maybe? Let's see. We are presented with Cheryl Glickman, our protaginist. A woman who Dave Eggers called, 'one of the most original, most confounding and strangely sympathetic characters in recent fiction.' I have a feeling that Eggers has been diagnosed with a severe case of hyperbole here. In many ways, Cheryl reminded me of a highly neurotic version of the protaginist of Jenny Offill's brilliant short novel Dept. of Speculation, one of the best novels of last year. I've seen many review of this novel describing Cheryl as \"quirky\". God I hate that word. I refuse to ever use it. Cheryl is highly individual, eccentric, and idiosyncratic. She's Frances Ha and Annie Hall. She gets dumped with her boss' daughter, ninteen-year-old Clee, and this is where the novel tries to begin. Not only does Cheryl, a woman in her early forties, have to deal with a teenager claiming squatter's rights on her sofa, she is also kind of obsessed with Phillip, a man who is twenty years her senior. However, Phillip has other, Nabokovian, plans. The first half of this novel middles along. It mainly concerns Cheryl's life and those around her. Nothing much happens. I might even go so far as to say the first half is boring. Well it isn't boring per se. To use Art Historical terms, the first half is Northern Renaissance and the second half is Rococo. The novel comes alive in the second half due to an event which inverts everything on its head. Suddenly you begin caring about the characters. You see their human side. It was in the second half that I really began enjoying this odd, odd novel. The plot is like that of the seminal classic Weird Science. At first it's great, partying with mid-1980s Kelly LeBrock but then you've got to deal with real issues. Like Bill Paxton being turned into a gigantic talking pile of shit.This novel is definitely weird. It's different. There isn't a single sane character in there. It's like an episode of Kath & Kim but also not like that at all. Margaret Atwood meets Woody Allen in this novel but not in the way you want. So, can we answer the question now? Is The First Bad Man worth the hype? I say, yes. Yes because it is unlike any other novel I've read. Yes because it makes you laugh at the most inappropriate of things. Yes because of the phrase \"mutual soaping\". Yes because it is a realistic portrayal of life, no matter how zany. Yes. It is worth the hype."}, {"userName": "Katie Parker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1731180-katie-parker", "userReview": "Miranda July, you wonderfully weird creature. This book is probably one of the craziest things I've ever read, but it works, absolutely and completely. She crafts sentences that make you think the world was missing something until they were written. She finds genuine humor in the sadness, and poignancy in the mundane.\"I wondered how many other women had sat on this toilet and stared at this floor. Each of them the center of their own world, all of them yearning for someone to put their love into so they could see their love, see that they had it.\"\"If you were wise enough to know that this life would consist mostly of letting go of things you wanted, then why not get good at the letting go, rather than the trying to have?\"And, of course, it wouldn't be the same if I wasn't scarred for life by a piece of her work. (Has anyone else seen \"Me and You and Everyone We Know\"? Then you know what I'm talking about.) I really hope none of my fellow bus riders were reading over my shoulder during the odd, explicit sex parts. As uncomfortable as they often were to read, though, they were so often bookended by incredible passages that pulled me right back into the story.In summary, it was amazing, though not without its cringeworthy moments. But they aren't cringeworthy because they are bad; they are cringeworthy because people are weird and flawed and real, and it's rare to see that in such a transparent way."}, {"userName": "Will Walton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28919261-will-walton", "userReview": "I read the final pages twice silently, once aloud.

Or : if A M Homes and Miranda July went to a party dressed as each other no one would notice. Lorrie Moore, though, she\u2019d be fuming (they\u2019re wearing her dress but it looks sexier on them!), but you can\u2019t copyright being really funny and sad about American suburbia. There\u2019s a Bad Sex in Fiction award given yearly by the (British) Guardian newspaper. Miranda July will not win. All the sex in this novel is bad, but it's deliberately very bad, wince-inducing, and there\u2019s quite a lot of it. I will spare you the details but do not read most of this book while eating cereals, they may well go up your nose.

Well, all the other reviews will tell you what happens then, or you could let MJ tell you herself. When I pick a novel to read I don\u2019t want to know much about it except it\u2019s supposed to be good. It seems people have been dancing naked in the streets to celebrate the wonderful loveliness of this novel. Well, I wouldn\u2019t go that far. I\u2019d doff my overcoat and loosen my tie and say \u201cyeah, pretty good\u201d a few times. It was nice. It was in favour of people and it has an understanding that there are those who in the midst of a teeming planet live lonely lives. I kind of sort of maybe-ish well yes okay recommend this.

Cheryl looks at the world in her own hopeful and peculiar way. She fantasizes about an older man who is busy seducing a teenage girl, she tries to make psychic connections to a long-lost baby named Kubelko Bondy, and she has therapy sessions with a woman who is not really a therapist and is actually having an affair with the therapist Cheryl should be seeing. When Cheryl lets her bosses\u2019 daughter, a young surly woman named Clee, move in with her, she takes on a person that she initially fears, but eventually loves and feels protective over. Without giving too much away, I\u2019ll say that what happens between Cheryl and Clee makes The First Bad Man one of the strangest and most surprising novels of the year. The way Miranda July writes about the inner-life and longing of her characters is a thrill to read. It\u2019s like she has a special kind of X-ray vision, where she can see the way her characters really think and act, and even when they\u2019re weird or inappropriate, she still presents them to us unashamedly.

YES NOWhat if that performance art came in the form of a book? YES NOScore each Yes with 1 point.

The first half screams \"look at me, look at me, I'm cool, I'm hip, I'm a performance artist writing a book.\" It also is very, very funny. It's entirely black humor. If you think it is serious, then you really won't like the book. I NEVER laugh out loud at books. Not books written by comedians, but there are some scenes in this one that definitely had me chuckling.The second half is much more of a traditional novel and is more sweet and touching.It's the combination of the two that probably convinced Amazon to recommend this as one of the best books of January. Trust me, you will think the editors lost their mind if you don't actually finish the whole book.The book revolves around a woman, Cheryl, in her forties who is narcissistic and really hasn't grown up. She also is a little nutty in some of her belief systems . . .just a little on the fringe. Clee, the 20-something daughter of Cheryl's bosses, needs a place to live and moves in with Cheryl. The book revolves around the two women, but there are a number of sub plots that somehow in the end do actually connect together. They all made me feel a little dirty while reading them to be a little honest. But on some level, this train wreck of a first half barrels down the track to a touching second half, and I find myself reflecting back on the whole thing as a fun, very fresh, read.I'm recommending this to exactly no one unless you pass the quiz above.

These are the little things that can pass through the mind without a second thought, but here she brings them to a whole new level. The characters have free reign to act on and explore all their deep impulses--they have let go completely of normal social rules. Things definitely get weird, as they would if anyone let their innermost, darkest parts of themselves guide their everyday lives.July's writing is so unique. There is no one who has her voice, though there are a lot of imitators out there. I loved this book for its small moments and beautiful turns of phrase.

The illogical magic that means when you finally forget someone or delete their number, they text you. The pathetic desperation of knowing you and a man have travelled through lifetimes together\u2026.while he's busy telling you about someone else.

As the reader, I understood Cheryl's body as something ugly - not because it was or wasn't, but because of the way Cheryl moved through life inside it. The First Bad Man is hyperreality, but still reality. Some parts were desperately uncomfortable to read but mostly because they reminded me of an ugliness inside myself. Cheryl was pathetic, but not over-exaggeratedly so, and the way her mind worked was breathtakingly familiar to me. The way so many babies become Kubelko Bondy. The way that sex - masturbation - becomes ritualised, inaccessible, too big to control. An aggressive maternalism that repulses and juxtaposes itself. I feel like I'm seeing more and more of these ugly, internal, hyperreal, powerful//powerless women in literature of late and I for one think it's about f*cking time.I kinda feel like those who don't get it probably aren't women trapped inside their own minds, with that pathetic, desperate ugliness inside of them.

I was, like, really? It would have been interesting to read a feminist Fight Club short story, but July must've, I dunno, gotten pregnant at some point in the writing and wanted to share her homebirthing experience with the reader, share her observations of maternity, motherhood, or whatever. I wanted more for Cheryl other than her life's plan being dictated by the poor choices of a psychotic houseguest (I never really got why the parents didn't just give Clee money to live on her own...I wanted to strangle Carl and Suzanne in every appearance...sic some of Marcellus Wallace's crew on Philip). Too bad July didn't. Want more for Cheryl, that is. P.S. I can't believe George Saunders blurbed this novel. Eggers, yes, because a byline is a byline.

I'm not sure I would recommend this book to anyone.On the plus side, I laughed a lot while listening to the audio. Miranda July reads her own novel in a perfect tone, with a practical straightforward voice that makes Cheryl come across the way she probably does in the world of the novel - a boring almost middle-aged woman on the outside and CRAZY on the inside. We are treated to an almost constant internal dialogue, of magical babies with the presence of Kubelko Bondy, of sexual fantasies that are anything but enticing, of the tolerance of horrible people that seem to surround her - inept therapists with imaginary specialties, bosses that are a flavor of \"enlightened\" plus an incredible variety of selfish that seemed actually pretty familiar to me, a man trying to get her approval to have sex with a teenager, and a teenager who lives in her house while physically abusing her and disrespecting her space. I'm not sure about your internal dialogue. There are certainly thoughts I have in my head that I wouldn't want shared, but Cheryl's internal life surpasses the absurd.

THAT SAID, the story does suffer a little bit in the second half, meandering a little too much for my tastes, and as the idiosyncratic main character starts to grow as a person, the oddness of this novel starts to level out. THAT ALSO SAID, it wraps itself up quite nicely in the end, and left me satisfied. This is less of a novel and more of an experience; one that you\u2019ll undoubtedly walk away from a better person. Good stuff."}, {"userName": "Tfitoby", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5454475-tfitoby", "userReview": "Miranda July has produced a novel that is so Miranda July only fans of Miranda July could love it. Yes, it's got her character quirks, yes it's got some potentially inappropriate relationships, yes there are some quite bizarre moments and naturally there are some magical ways of seeing the world, especially the world experienced by Cheryl Glickman. But then almost out of nowhere she flips a switch and Cheryl starts to come of age in a pretty straight forward narrative of self discovery. Except it feels like it has evolved naturally from the strange little narrative you've already experienced, you'll believe a man really can make the sun rise with the tapping of a coin on a lamppost or a middle aged white woman can be soul mates with a pre teen black boy.There were times when I was reading it as a response to 50 Shades of Grey, such is the honest and realistic representation of the exploration of female identity and sexuality that runs throughout but it is the way July explores her own feelings surrounding becoming a mother for the first time that makes the novel so interesting and moving to read. She seems to have such an interesting and unique way of representing the way she interacts with the world around her, it's inspired and influenced other artists who most of the time (including her husbands second film) just seem to appear like Miranda July-lite. She's a marmite artist and this is a marmite novel, it's love or hate and there's no real room for in between, unless perhaps you just \"don't get it\"."}, {"userName": "Anndra Dunn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5814292-anndra-dunn", "userReview": "This is a book about Quirkily Insane and unlikeable caricatures doing Quirkily Insane and unlikeable things. Unfortunately the book wants you to root for its protagonist and this just isn't going to happen.This was an exhausting read, maintaining a constant low-level unpleasantness. The authorial voice is arch and swithers between trying to present aspects of depression as slyly humorous - such as the protagonist explaining her system for managing her life, all going back to only having one set of dishes so that dirty dishes can't pile up and create a vicious cycle of depression - or attempting to evoke pathos, but the former is weak and the latter is plainly artificial given the contempt Miranda July shows for flaws of her absurd characters. Social dysfunction and anxiety is placed in the same category as a belief in crystal healing or eating kale with every meal.

That black-and-white cover doesn\u2019t really give you any clues, either, though when you open it up you get the riotously colored modern art swirls of the endpapers. You could think of the design as emblematic of the book itself: unpromising from the outside but reasonably rewarding once you get into it.Cheryl Glickman is a neurotic 43-year-old manager at Open Palm, a Los Angeles area women\u2019s self-defense organization that now mostly runs fitness classes. Her obsessive personality comes through with her devotion to \u201cthe system,\u201d a strict minimalism that involves as few possessions as possible, plus reusing everything to save time and increase efficiency, and her crush on Phillip Bettelheim, an odious colleague 22 years her senior.The book opens with two key events: Phil recommends she undergo chromotherapy for the globus in her throat; and her bosses con her into hosting their 21-year-old daughter, Clee, who seems to do nothing but lie around watching TV. The color therapy morphs into more general therapy with Ruth-Anne, while the unwanted houseguest changes Cheryl\u2019s life forever, though not at all in the way one might expect.\u201cWhat was the name of the situation I was in? What category was this?\u201d Cheryl wonders to herself. Clee messes with her system and starts mocking and even physically abusing Cheryl. Instead of kicking her out, though, Cheryl codifies their fights into reenactments of some of Open Palm\u2019s 1990s self-defense videos (the title phrase comes from one of these scenarios).And then things get sexual. First Phil starts texting about his infatuation with a 16-year-old, asking permission to make a move. Next Cheryl starts an intense masturbation campaign, imagining Clee in various pornographic situations. Sometimes Cheryl pretends she is Phil diddling Clee. To take her mind off things, Ruth-Anne suggests that Cheryl sing. She chooses a David Bowie song.(Still with me?)Cheryl has conflicted feelings about Clee. She likes the physical closeness of their combative relationship. At the same time, she\u2019s disgusted by Clee\u2019s laziness and smelly feet. Still, she\u2019s fixated. \u201cHer cowlike vacuousness didn\u2019t really bother me anymore. Or it didn\u2019t matter\u2014her personality was just a little piece of parsley decorating warm tawny haunches.\u201dEventually Cheryl wakes up to the reality that she is \u201ca middle-aged woman who couldn\u2019t keep her hands off herself.\u201d The first half of the book is about fantasy and fabrication. \u201cReal comes and goes and isn\u2019t very interesting,\u201d as Ruth-Anne says. In the second, though, things swiftly turn concrete when Clee realizes she\u2019s pregnant. Cheryl takes on an advisory and later a supportive role; \u201cI\u2019d been her enemy, then her mother, then her girlfriend. That was three lifetimes right there.\u201dDoes Clee love Cheryl? Does Cheryl love Clee? It\u2019s hard to say; \u201cmaybe that was the point of love: not to think.\u201d Regardless, all of a sudden, Cheryl finds herself a mother. \u201c[Clee] was the worst possible person to do this with\u2014that was evident now, but what could I do?\u201d July herself had a new baby at the time of writing this novel, which accounts for how authentic the Jack sections feel. It\u2019s a bit of an aimless story, but watching Cheryl\u2019s development is certainly interesting. I could have done without most of the Phil stuff, but it turns out he\u2019s important to the plot.If I had to compare July\u2019s style to anyone else\u2019s, it would be Douglas Coupland. At times Cheryl was also a bit like Don Tillman in The Rosie Effect, what with her matter-of-fact recounting of Jack\u2019s fetal development. Blend the voyeuristic raunchiness of The Heart Goes Last with the uncomfortable physical reality of After Birth, two novels I\u2019ve previously reviewed on this blog, and you get an idea of the dynamic at work here.I can\u2019t say I entirely enjoyed the book; I don\u2019t always appreciate quirky-for-quirkiness\u2019-sake. However, my utter lack of expectations was a good thing, and I thought July did a solid job of making her somewhat unpleasant characters sympathetic by making them go through one of life\u2019s central challenges: parenthood. She also comes up with some delightfully off-the-wall sentences, as in my favorite passage, in which Cheryl vocalizes her thoughts to baby Jack:\u201cYou are a sweet potato.\u201d This sounded literal, as if I was letting him know he was a root vegetable, a tuber. \u201cYou\u2019re a baby,\u201d I added, just in case there was any confusion on that last point.(Originally published with images at my blog, Bookish Beck.)"}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "[Anyway, the coexistence doesn't really work.

Just like a bad man, the kind that comes to a sleepy town and makes all kinds of trouble before galloping off again. She wasn't the first bad man ever but the first I'd ever met who had long blond hair and pink velour pants. She snapped her gum impatiently.\nThis was my first reaction upon finishing The First Bad Man, and it bears repeating: \u201cI smiled and winced through the whole thing and then ended it in tears.\u201d It would be patronising and dismissive to call this book merely \u201cquirky\u201d or \u201ckinky\u201d (but it is both), and Miranda July \u2013 award-winning filmmaker, short-story-writer, performance artist, and first-time novelist \u2013 is presumably too busy and too thoughtful to waste her time writing a book that can be dismissed that easily. I don't think July wrote a shocking book for shock's sake, or reached for the ludicrous just to be funny (but it is both shocking and terribly funny), but in a way that reminded me somewhat of the classic-of-the-absurd A Confederacy of Dunces, she created a character so outside the bounds of reality that she opened a window upon the hearts of all of us; Cheryl Glickman is the exception that proves the rules for this messy human project. This wasn't a passive reading experience \u2013 I had physical reactions, smiling and wincing, on every page \u2013 and I can't help but admire any book that pulls that out of me. Let's meet Cheryl Glickman:I drove to the doctor's office as if I was starring in a movie Phillip was watching \u2013 windows down, hair blowing, just one hand on the wheel. When I stopped at red lights, I kept my eyes mysteriously forward. Who is she? people might have been wondering. Who is that middle-aged woman in the blue Honda?Who is she? Cheryl is a frumpy forty-three-year-old single woman (her best physical features are her shell-like ears, so she tends to enter rooms ear-first) who lives alone (with a bizarre system of housekeeping rules meant to stave off decrepitude), who remote-manages a women's self-defense centre (Open Palm) that has transitioned into selling self-defense-as-fitness DVDs, and who has a vivid and long-running sexual fantasy involving a sixty-five-year-old board member, Phillip; a wrinkled, balding jerk who thinks it's funny to grab Cheryl by her chunky necklace and lead her around the office (but as this is the only action Cheryl gets, she's willing to laugh along as though Phillip is just making fun of the kind of jerk who might actually do something like that unironically). As the novel begins, two situations arise that rattle Cheryl's smooth-edged equilibrium: Phillip has fallen in love with a sixteen-year-old, and through a series of crude texts (he describes his \u201cstiff member\u201d and how he wants to \u201ccream\u201d on the girl's \u201cjugs\u201d), he asks Cheryl's blessing before bedding the girl; and Cheryl's bosses ask her to allow their twenty-one-year-old daughter, Clee, to temporarily move in with her. Cheryl is so passive and uncomplaining that she neither balks at Phillip as he downgrades her from potential partner to asexual arbiter, nor at Clee as she refuses to follow the household rules, looming large and beautiful, stinking of foot rot. Cheryl unintentionally begins therapy at this time, and for the first time ever, has someone to talk to. Putting aside the fact that the therapist invites Cheryl to pee in empty Chinese food takeout containers behind a ripped paper screen in the corner of her office if she needs to use the facilities, Cheryl finds the experience enlightening; and especially when Dr. Tibbetts shares the fact the she and the colour therapist she shares the office with like to engage in \u201cadult games\u201d involving fantasy and role-playing. Cheryl is able to use this idea of game-playing to reinterpret (and gain power in) her relationships with both Phillip and Clee. When Clee becomes physically abusive, Cheryl reacts with the popping and butterflying of Open Palm's old self-defense videos, and once Clee recognises the moves and the scenarios that Cheryl starts intentionally setting up, she responds in kind and the pair begin wrestling around the house like a cross between Fight Club and Cato jumping out of the shadows at Inspector Clouseau. It's creepy enough to have Clee reciting \u201cYum yum yum\u201d from the bushes as Cheryl approaches to unlock the front door, but what the young woman doesn't know is that on the inside, Cheryl is imagining that she has a \u201cstiff member\u201d that can't wait to \u201ccream\u201d on Clee's \u201cjugs\u201d. And while the game-playing does allow Cheryl to overcome her lifelong impotence, her therapist recognises that Cheryl has begun to dehumanise everyone around her; turning them into pawns for her fantasies. And then things happen and things change and Cheryl finds love in an unexpected place.\nSometimes I looked at her sleeping face, the living flesh of it, and was overwhelmed by how precarious it was to love a living thing. She could die simply from lack of water. It hardly seemed safer than falling in love with a plant. \nI liked that we don't learn anything about Cheryl's childhood that might explain the why of her strange existence \u2013 other than the time that she intensely bonded with a visiting infant when she was nine; an event that caused Cheryl to seek out a psychic connection with every baby she sees for the rest of her life \u2013 and meeting her in middle age, it was touching to watch as Cheryl transforms from someone with a wholly fantasy-based life to one who has a physical presence in the world. The ending was earned but not predictable, and as I opened with, I was in tears by the time I closed the book's covers. Loved it."}], "description": "From the acclaimed filmmaker, artist, and bestselling author of No One Belongs Here More Than You, a spectacular debut novel that is so heartbreaking, so dirty, so tender, so funny--so Miranda July--readers will be blown away. Here is Cheryl, a tightly-wound, vulnerable woman who lives alone, with a perpetual lump in her throat. She is haunted by a baby boy she met when she was six, who sometimes recurs as other people's babies. Cheryl is also obsessed with Phillip, a philandering board member at the women's self-defense non-profit where she works. She believes they've been making love for many lifetimes, though they have yet to consummate in this one. When Cheryl's bosses ask if their twenty-one-year-old daughter Clee can move into her house for a little while, Cheryl's eccentrically-ordered world explodes. And yet it is Clee--the selfish, cruel blond bombshell--who bullies Cheryl into reality and, unexpectedly, provides her the love of a lifetime. Tender, gripping, slyly hilarious, infused with raging sexual fantasies and fierce maternal love, Miranda July's first novel confirms her as a spectacularly original, iconic and important voice today, and a writer for all time.
