The first chapter is very confronting as the scene is set for what is to come. Then the author presents the sorry tale bit by bit, using each chapter for a different point of view. I found myself on the edge of my seat waiting for the final horrible thing that I knew must happen but when it did, the reason for it was not what I expected.I thought it was all very thought provoking and very cleverly done. So sad that a few short, ill judged minutes could ruin so many lives yet it was also very realistic, very possible.This was a fascinating read and I shall be looking out for more books by Anita Shreve"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1620952-carol", "userReview": "I had trouble rating this book; it is definetly a page-turner, so why only two stars? I found the storyline riveting, but the writing style took me many pages to get used to - overly simplistic at times. I also felt that it had too many frivolous descriptions; I found myself skimming to find actions, feelings, and more dialogue. During the first half of the book, I was saying, \"I do not like this book at all,\" but as I read further, I discovered the value of it as a lesson to be learned about how one poor decision can be tremendously devastating to so many lives, and what a snowballing effect each action and reaction has. Perhaps the reality of the choices (of both the adults and the teenagers) as a sign of the times was too depressing for me! As another reviewer mentioned, I agree that this could be a useful book for a high school class discussion, but some teachers may have trouble getting through the first few pages in a classroom setting. I am usually a Shreve fan, but this one gets a three for plot; a one for style; hence, an average of two."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "This was a bookclub read and would not be my usual choice in a book as I am not a fan of Anita Shreve and having read the blurb on this book thought the story sounded different and interesting.The story is about a sex scandal involving 3 boys and one 14yr old girl and is told from the prospective of all those involved and affected by this scandal. The opening few pages shocked me and I wondered how Shreve would handle the rest of the story how in depth she would go with her characters and their reasons for their actions. But unforunatly that is about as much impact this book had on me and I was so disappointed with the developments of this story. The story is told from several characters points of view and while I loved this idea I felt it did not work as Shreve's characters were never fully developed and as I thought I was getting to know one a little better it was on the next chapter and the next character and I was left feeling I needed more information. I think to be honest I never really cared about any of the characters to make me have any great love for the story.I wanted answers and never seemed to get them and felt the book fell short especially on the characters of Sienna and Mikes wife.On the plus side this novel really makes you think What If...... it was my daughter, my son, my neighbour how would I feel, how would I deal or cope with the situation, I kept thinking the whole way through the story that every action has a consequence and how you deal with the consequences can change the rest of you life and there is no going back. A very thought provoking novel and a great round the table bookclub discussion book but for me not a page turner and not enough character development and therefore a 3 star read."}, {"userName": "Deanna ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15662887-deanna", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the book Testimony by Anita Shreve. Once I started reading I found it very hard to put down and finished it within 2 days. The story revolves around Avery Academy, a small private High School where a sex scandal involving the students was captured on video tape and has shocked the small community. A retelling of the events leading up to the tragic night told by many of those directly and indirectly involved. I was quite drawn in to the characters sadness and pain. I felt for them as their mistakes and poor decisions drastically affected them and many others. A very well written and well paced book. I found it easy to keep up even though there were many characters with a variety of personalities. I found the characters very well developed and their voices added quite a lot to the book. This book shows how sometimes the decisions we make can alter and impact our lives as well as many others lives forever.

No matter what anyone tells you.\"Antia Shreve's Testimony is a stunningly crafted book. A sex scandal, caught on tape, rocks a private school in Vermont; the consequences (arguably) resulting in the end of several marriages, the end of several futures, the end of a life, and more besides. Shreve captures many points of view from character directly or indirectly affected, using a mixture of 1st, 2nd and 3rd person that works exceptionally well. Each chapter is titled with the name of the person who offers their thoughts via a journal entry, a letter, a conversation etc - but each character is so well written with their own individual 'voice' that you will soon be able to instantly recognise who's who.Moving at a cracking pace in the manner of a thriller, Testimony is much more than a literary experiment; it's a fascinating, at times profoundly moving book that offers hope amongst the bleakness and beautiful and ugly shades of grey."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899455-kimberly", "userReview": "I really looked forward to reading this book, but ended up being disappointed. I liked the plot, and I liked the idea of hearing the story from different characters' points of view, but ultimately I feel that the format caused a breakdown in the action and prevented the plot from clearly being executed. There were too many characters and descriptions that didn't do anything for the story, and too many parts that didn't fit. Two big points of contention for me were Mike and Anna's relationship, and the mystery of the cameraman. The affair between Mike and Anna felt out of place, and I think the format of the book is responsible. The individual testimonies didn't allow for the reader to sense that a relationship between Mike and Anna was developing, and for me it seemed kind of rushed and poorly explained. This was especially disappointing since the affair was the catalyst for Silas's actions. I also was disappointed because I felt that by the way characters kept wondering who the cameraman was, the identity of the cameraman was actually significant. Overall, I liked the story but I feel it would have been better served to be told in a traditional format. The separation of all the testimonies weakened the storyline and prevented me from really caring about the characters and what happened to them."}, {"userName": "Lanette", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/868482-lanette", "userReview": "I made it to page 83 and in the middle of a random paragraph asked myself \"Why am I reading this?\"The writing style... flipping between characters and times... is a tad confusing.

They are raised in a utterly sex-saturated culture, where women are now wrongly taught that objectification & promiscuity = female \"empowerment\". We blithely brush over the endangerment inherent in the new era of rampant, narcissistic social media and an epidemic of misogynistic pornography thrust on our young teens, and turn a blind eye to the havoc & destruction excess alcohol is wreaking across all sectors of society, but particularly in the lives of our young people. Then, the moment a vulnerable young lady finds herself in an exploitative situation, or worse - one of outright abuse! - we are quick to call \"she asked for it!\"Which is EXACTLY what Shreve's book does. Multiple testimonies of narrators, all contributing to the slut-shaming of \"Sienna\". Behold the tired, devastating, she-asked-for-it cliche rolled out once more to stomach-turning effect: She dressed too provocatively! She lied about being raped! She enjoyed it! She didn't say NO! She was drinking too much! She was out at night time alone!The sustained attempt in this novel to create empathy and sympathy for the three adult men involved in her exploitation galled me throughout: They were talented basketball players with such promising academic careers ahead of them! They were tempted by a temptress and they couldn't resist her tempting ways! I understand the author had a clear message here to impart about the stark dangers of underage alcohol consumption - and I do applaud her desire and attempt to do so! She's right, so sadly right; one moment of alcohol-fueled stupidity CAN and WILL lead to a life of regret, to ruination and destruction, to tragedy. However, I cannot stress enough how readily I felt this message got lost in all the slut-shaming and sympathizing with those good and talented boys who were led astray by that shameful, willing slut. Unfortunately, the cliche totally clouded the message.Alcohol has so much to answer for in the ruined lives of young people - yes! - but more culpable is the hypocritical culture in which they are raised. Sexuality shoved down their throats from the moment they can hold their baby heads up to see a objectifying beer ad. Mixed messages and double standards throughout their young lives - Women are sex objects! Women are equal to men! Women are temptresses! Women are in charge of their own powerful sexuality! Women are sluts if they ask for it too often and too readily!And yet we wave them off, unarmed, into the frighteningly fraught world of the hypersexualised adolescent with nary a moment of guilt re our own contribution to their vulnerability!Sheesh.Now, I must affirm: I won't let this book turn me off Anita Shreve's excellent writing in future. I am just, personally, so very disappointed with the tone taken in this book. \"Sienna\" read neither as a real character nor a thoughtful, driving message to young people. She was, merely, a shallow, distressing cliche. And that will be what I remember most from this otherwise promising book."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2657711-denise", "userReview": "4.0 out of 5 stars Sexting...this story is taken right from today's headlines...This review is from: Testimony: A Novel (Hardcover)This was a sad but interesting novel about 3 boys who were caught on videotape committing various activities that were labeled a sex crime because the girl involved was only 14 and the boys were 18 and 19 years old. The scandal and resultant fallout from the event affects the young female victim, the boys, their families and friends, the students, as well as the entire community of Avery where the private school is located.The disconcerting thing about the book was that it was told from many different points of view and sometimes was confusing as it went back and forth in time. Those changing voices also reflect the fact that perspective is everything when looking back at an event or situation. The characters in the story all suffer in various ways as the boys face the consequences of their drunken night of debauchery.No matter how you feel about teens, alcohol, and sexual activity - it becomes clear that when those three exist in combination there will be tragedy and innocent victims resulting from those poor choices.UPDATE -- I have used this book for my upper level high school book club that had both female and male members. It was so interesting to hear their thoughts about everything that happened in the book and which characters they identified with, the ones they hated -- and why, and how they felt about the consequences and conclusions.

The idea of a graphic sex scandal involving a very young teen did not appeal to me. I hate reading about that stuff. I ordered it just because it was a new Anita Shreve, not even really paying attention or caring about the premise. This author always manages to draw me in with her writing, however, and this book was no exception. Within the first few chapters I was hooked and stayed that way. The graphic stuff is dealt with in the beginning and the rest of the book deals with the fallout. This isn't just a book about a boarding school sex scandal. It's a book which shows just how far-reaching the acts of an individual or individuals can be. Instead of one narrator, there is a myriad of them. Though that might seem confusing, it isn't. It is a brilliant way to get the point across that life's ripple effect is broad and repercussions may be incalcuable. It is a sad, sad book and not for what may seem the obvious reasons.

I stayed up until 3:30 a.m. to finish it, then couldn't get to sleep for thinking about it! It's quite a departure from Shreve's usual style and content, so give it a try even if you think you don't care for her work. The story revolves around some drunken sexual antics in a boarding school dorm room that are caught on video tape.Shreve uses a large number of voices or points of view, which has the potential to be cumbersome. I thought she handled it very deftly, and the style works for this story. Taken as a whole, the book explores how different people view the same shameful event. Some are cavalier, some blame themselves, some want to blame others, and some just want to use scandal to further their own goals. Some people are able to pay for their mistakes and then move on with their lives, whereas others use this one misfortune to define the rest of their lives with regret and inaction.

Testimony was no different. It's a very powerful story that grabs your attention from the beginning and keeps you hooked to the end.The beginning of the novel introduces us to a devastating videotape that involves two boys 18 years old, one boy 19 years old and a very young girl, aged 14. The tape shows them involved in very explicit sexual acts. They are all very clearly drunk. This tape ends up falling into the headmaster's hands and he scrambles to keep it contained within the Academy's walls. However, this doesn't happen and from that point on everything spirals out of control. The story is told in the form of testimony, hence the title of the book. This testimony comes from several different people from the man who sold alcohol to teens to the cafeteria staff and to those more intimately involved and finally on to those who committed the offense. The boys involved all played on the school basketball team and were all very talented. They were to go on to college. They all came from decent enough homes. So this brings us to the question of how does this kind of thing happen? Is it something inherently wrong with the boys? Is it their upbringing? Or, was it instigated by the young girl as there will always be people who question this?I felt of all the characters Silas truly felt disgusted with himself over what had happened. He couldn't come to terms with it. His mother Anna and something she does is really a catalyst for all that happens. Not that anything could justify these horrendous acts but it really goes to show us how one act in a person's life can have devastating effects on others and spiral into one disaster after another for so many others including themselves. I found one section in the book that has stayed with me so I'd like to share it...\"A single action can cause a life to veer off in a direction it was never meant to go. Falling in love can do that, you think. And so can a wild party. You marvel at the way each has the power to forever alter an individual's compass. And it is the knowing that such a thing can so easily happen, as you did not know before, not really, that has fundamentally changed you...\" ---page 277The only complaint I would have with this novel is the way it was written in testimony. I didn't feel as if I really got to connect with anyone enough. That being said it is a gripping story and I read it quickly.

Each time I pick up one of her books it's a brand new experience; a completely unpredictable and entertaining experience. It feels as though she's reinvented her style with each book. Testimony was no exception. Told through the voices of 23 different characters - yes 23 - with snippets of information delivered in seemingly random order, and primarily in the third person I can't believe how well it worked. Somehow she gave distinctive voices to each character, the story was compelling and it became so personal I felt tearful on a couple of occasions.The story revolved around the discovery of a sex tape made by students at a private school in Vermont. Each of the 23 characters were involved in some way whether the headmaster of the school, the parents of the students involved in the incident, the students themselves, journalists, police, the lady in the dining room at the school and so forth. I especially liked the way Shreve focussed on how one incident could have such significant repercussions and as she wrote \"...you wonder how the events of one night ....can change the lives of so many people forever\"......\"A single action can cause a life to veer off in a direction it was never meant to go. Falling in love can do that, you think. And so can a wild party. You marvel at the way each has the power to forever alter an individual's compass.\" Instead of trying to make a moralistic judgement call on the incident itself she showed the ways people were affected, the way some people rightly or wrongly carried the burden of guilt whilst others were easily able to cast their guilt aside.Earlier I commented that Testimony was not one of my favourite Anita Shreve titles but I'm retracting that statement.

It landed at our place, left by a guest. So it was not a book I would normally buy and did not know what to expect. The private school sex scandal, starting the book in graphic detail almost had me put it down. It was not my kind of book at all. But then the story pulled me in. The different characters relate their involvement one by one in each chapter and although it was annoying in the beginning, it soon made sense. Although the taped sex scandal was the main issue in the book - who should be blamed, who was really guilty or innocent, it soon becomes clear that it was only the trigger that set off a multitude of 'endings' to pre-existing problems swirling around below the surface which ultimately results in death, divorce, and lost opportunities. It is really a remarkable book because at the end nobody could be found not-guilty. It is a brilliant constructed book about the effect one instant in time can destroy a lifetime afterwards and shook an entire community - not only one person. The reader is left with the question 'What would have happened if the egocentric J Dot did not want a tape of himself to upload to YouTube?' What a huge difference it would have made in so many lives! And Silas: how different would the outcome for him would have been if he responded differently to betrayal in his life. It counts for everyone involved.In the end I wanted to cry for them all. This book should change the mindset about prejudice, ignorance, and whatever inspires gossip to focus on one culprit instead of considering the complete picture.

It is a sex tape and it reveals the activities of some of the best and brightest \u2013 along with the unfortunate appearance on the tape of a fourteen-year-old girl \u2013 which makes the action unlawful in the state of Vermont.Next, we find Ellen, the mother of one of the boys, receiving a disturbing phone call, followed by a headlong rush to Avery, to learn more about her son\u2019s misdeeds.Over the next several chapters, the voices include the boys, the parents, the girl, the girl friend of one of the boys, the law enforcement officials, and even journalists and researchers \u2013 all eager to peek behind the scenes and uncover the antecedents to the behavior of these adolescents on one horrible night in January.In cleverly paced story-telling, the author peels back the layers until finally, at the very end, we see how the events began \u2013 or so it would seem \u2013 with one illicit action between two adults, which set a chain of subsequent events into play.

Thanks, Miriam! I met Anita Shreve at the 2002 National Book Festival signing in Washington, D.C. I've been in love with her writing since I first read The Pilot's Wife many years before that, and I will admit here that I've tried to emulate her style in my own writing, though my writing has not met muster.Testimony is one of those novels that slowly draws you into a prep school known as Avery Academy in Vermont where four boys and one girl make a decision that will change their lives and the lives of other students, teachers, administrators, families, and neighbors for years to come. Testimony is given throughout the novel from a number of characters--minor and major characters--illustrating the depth to which decisions of one or several people can impact others who are seemingly unconnected to the decision-makers. Jacqueline Barnard, a researcher from the University of Vermont, receives the interviews either in written form or through personal encounters with several of the characters.The videotape that surfaces in Avery Academy Headmaster Mike Bordwin's office is central to the story that unfolds in the novel, but another decision among a pair of adults also impacts the students and others in the town. Shreve is a master of character development and setting. I was drawn into the bitter cold winter snow of Vermont and the coziness of the town and the school, as well as the dark undercurrents in each of these characters' lives. Shreve is adept at highlighting the nuances of how underage sex and drinking affects the students, the faculty, and others, while not preaching to the reader.Silas and Noelle, two of the main adolescents in the novel, share a deep connection to one another at a tender age. It was tough to watch how this connection was tested and ultimately severed. Silas and his mother, Anna, also have a tight bond and naturally this connection is tested. Another adolescent boy, J. Dot and his bravado, serves as a foil to Silas' hard-working, compassionate, and dutiful persona. Noelle is the naive and romantic girl-next-door, while Sienna is the wild girl looking for trouble even if it is on a subconscious level.As always, Shreve has outdone herself in this novel, weaving a series of disjointed testimonies into a coherent and heart-wrenching story of love, loss, responsibility, and adolescence. I've often wondered if Shreve has ever tried her hand at poetry because the language she creates on the page paints a vivid image, and those images often conjure deeper meanings and emotions for the reader."}, {"userName": "Noel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/291748-noel", "userReview": "Excellent audiobook - narrated by several outstanding readers. The story unfolds in a Vermont elite boarding school when several older boys are involved in sexual activities with a 14 year old girl. The story is told from the point of view of the kids involved, the girl, the girl's roommate, the parents, the headmaster. All insightful. As the mother of 3 boys, much of the thoughts of the parents are thoughts that ran through my mind at one time or another. Not that I ever had these issues with any of my kids - but the thoughts, worries, and disbelief were present throughout their adolescence. And I could hear my sons' voices through the voices of some of these boys. Tough, lovestruck, good student, haughty, king of the hill -- if not my kids, then one of their friends.Shreve wrote eloquently and captured the essence of what it is to grow up - to make a mistake, albeit a huge one, and have not only your life, but many other lives changed."}, {"userName": "Chana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana", "userReview": "I didn\u2019t appreciate the graphic sex, nor did I actually appreciate the fiction. I found myself wanting to read the police reports, court reports and pyschological profiles of the incidents and people who inspired this fiction book.Here is a quote from the book that I thought had merit.\u201cI held on to the story at the Globe for as long as it lasted. I received a Pulitzer for my work on it. I could go on and on about the ethics of accepting a prize for a sordid tale about alcohol abuse, sexual assault, and privilege, but you take a look at any story that\u2019s won a prize in the last ten years, and you\u2019ll see that a lot of them are built on greed or lust or sex or murder. You tell yourself you\u2019re trying to go for a fair and responsible take - unlike the tabloids - but the truth is, we\u2019re all tabloids.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Lani", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/247896-lani", "userReview": "I haven't read anything by Anita Shreve before, so I didn't really know what to expect. Her writing style is pleasant enough, so it's a shame her book has me so angry that I don't want to read anything else she's written.You know what the world really needed? Another story about how girls 'ask for it' and cause the downfall of those poor beloved student-athletes. Because there isn't enough stigma around rape victims and whether they 'cry rape' and those poor manipulated rapists. This kind of BS is already fed to us on the regular by media, girls and women are frequently accused of making these stories of sexual assault up to... what? Ruin a guy's life? Or maybe excuse her own deviant behavior? Well, how about we acknowledge that teenage sex happens, that girls should be able to be sexual beings just like the boys, and maybe that whole shame thing can be taken out of the equation. But more importantly, why don't we acknowledge that the REAL problems here are the ACTUAL RAPES that occur far more regularly than these 'made up' rapes, and that we should maybe give the victim the benefit of the doubt since it's statistically a LOT more likely that she ISN'T LYING.Yes, in this book, the girl is lying. The girl is also a stereotype of a nymphette and a blond bimbo gold-digging and manipulating her parents and anyone else she can get her hands on. But every other woman portrayed is a pathetic stereotype, to the point where I find it difficult to believe that Anita Shreve IS a woman and has any female friends. Sure, it's fiction, every story gets told. But I think we hear this story all too often when a woman is assaulted - and we don't usually have 20 perspectives all clarifying just what a manipulative slut the girl was, including video to prove it! It's more often the athlete, the coach, the team, the school, the community that have all decided that he couldn't POSSIBLY have done wrong because they have a GAME to win, and a lone voice saying otherwise. Maybe this book would have had some merit if there had been ANY indication that the author knows that she's telling the story of the anomaly and not the more common reality. A note at the end about sexual assault and date rape and an acknowledgement that rape is really the one crime we always find the VICTIM at fault for one reason or another. Even in the 'book club notes' there were no questions about this issue, no comment made in the author interview.This book was disgusting and perpetuates the idea that rape victims are lying, were asking for it, and cannot be trusted. Fuck that, and fuck this book."}, {"userName": "Melissa (YA Book Shelf)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3599153-melissa-ya-book-shelf", "userReview": "I read this book at my sister's insistence, partially because she felt that the way the story was told amounted to little more that victim blaming and rape culture. Now, having read the book, I understand why she felt that way, but I also see more to it than that. The why? That's easy. There's a video with a bunch of guys (18-19) fooling around with a 14-year-old, and the first thing that the headmaster of the school says upon viewing it is that it looked like the girl knew what she was doing. This novel is told from the perspective of many other people - the boys, their parents, the girl...now known as Sienna..., her then roommate, etc. They're all either speaking to, writing to, or thinking about the situation that happened at Avery Academy a few years before because of a letter they received from a researcher from UVM who is studying the affects of alcohol on boy's behavior in secondary schools. There's only one person who is allowed to speak and voice a perspective in keeping with Sienna's story, namely Sienna herself. There are several people who offer a semi different perspective, but a few who clearly feel like the boys were wronged. The problem is that Sienna is portrayed like a liar and as someone who is less than intelligent. The only \"saving\" grace for me is that the multitude of voices that in some ways contradict one another only serve to point out how biased they are, that there's a problem with most of their perspectives. The only character who seems to offer a bit of hope is Robert, one of the boys who was charged for the incident. I wasn't expecting his letter to sound the way it did, but it was the best part in my opinion, other than the fact that it was incredibly addictive writing. I really couldn't put it down, even when I was uncomfortable with the way the story was portrayed, which I think says a lot."}], "description": "At a New England boarding school, a sex scandal is about to break. Even more shocking than the sexual acts themselves is the fact that they were caught on videotape. A Pandora's box of revelations, the tape triggers a chorus of voices--those of the men, women, teenagers, and parents involved in the scandal--that details the ways in which lives can be derailed or destroyed in one foolish moment.Writing with a pace and intensity surpassing even her own greatest work, Anita Shreve delivers in TESTIMONY a gripping emotional drama with the impact of a thriller. No one more compellinglyexplores the dark impulses that sway the lives of seeming innocents, the needs and fears that drive ordinary men and women into intolerable dilemmas, and the ways in which our best intentions can lead to our worst transgressions.", "title": "Testimony", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5519041-testimony", "average": 3.55, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442802133l/5519041.jpg", "reviews": 3135, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3530.Anita_Shreve", "name": "Anita Shreve"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5519041-testimony", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3121162-testimony", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3663146-testimony", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7804079-testemunho", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7250870-testimony", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5191.The_Pilot_s_Wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89399.Fortune_s_Rocks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14965.Light_on_Snow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228534.The_Weight_of_Water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96081.Sea_Glass"]}
