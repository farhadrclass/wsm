She writes more about state of mind, emotions, and point of view type themes than she does actual people and events. The common problem I had with her stories was the overall feeling that nothing ever happened. Her characters needn't be named because they aren't nearly as important as whatever \"point\" she's trying to make about what they're going through (typically about the pressures of being a woman in this time frame), and ultimately the stories are boring. There's also very little universality or timelessness with her work. Jane Austin and Kate Chopin are two authors who also loved writing about the difficulties of being a woman in their time period. I'm not a big fan of either of theirs, but I would never consider their stories to be boring, per se. Their chracters still do things, go places, they show us what life was like for them in their time. It feels like Stafford was less interested in creating stories to show us something than she was in just telling us what she wanted us to know."}, {"userName": "Christopher MacMillan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5964146-christopher-macmillan", "userReview": "What an unusual bunch of short stories Jean Stafford has come up with! First and foremost, to give credit where it is due, this is because Stafford's writing-style is so remarkable -- each sentence is rich with intelligent words and beautiful phrases strung together in a prose that is overflowing with symbolism and meaning, and which often surprises you with a sharp, unexpected uppercut of laugh-out-loud wit, right in the middle of the most dire and dark tales.Sure, much of these stories are dense and challenging to read and understand, usually because Stafford's vocabulary knows no bounds, but each tale is still magnificent. And the stories that are simpler to breeze through are just as intellectual, just as deep, and just as powerful as the ones which take a bit more time to trod through.Often hilarious, often sad, often disturbing, very often ambiguous, but always thought-provoking, Stafford's tales are all about people suffering from loneliness or the desire to fit in, and who, in the process, are on the brink of madness. Her characters always, inevitably lash out or break down in their [usually unsuccessful] quests for happiness, but we come to recognize that they are perhaps no more crazy than the rest of the population with which they surround themselves: perhaps \"normal\" or \"happy\" people are just as insane as Stafford's protagonists, but these outsiders will always stand out for being different from the status quo.\"The Collected Stories of Jean Stafford\" is divided into four sections: stories of Americans living abroad; of people in Boston; of people in the Midwest; and of people in Manhattan. The vast majority of these characters are women, and the age range is limitless -- she writes about young children and the elderly and everyone in between. Her stance as a feminist writer is clear, regardless of what age of the woman she is writing about, or in what location she may be; indeed, every different age and every different location (and every different marital status, every different social level, and many other demographics) allow Stafford to continually examine the feminist cause from a plethora of different angles. Her prose is always intent on destroying feminine stereotypes, and her symbolism tries to abolish gender roles, but it is never done lazily or in an overtly obvious manner: it's with subtlety and intelligence and originality and imagination, and as a result, I'm sure I missed some of the finer points along the way, but I loved the book - and each individual story - anyway. There are over 30 stories in this collection, and each one, in its own way, gave me quite a bit to ponder over. It's a terrific book which, deservedly, won Ms. Stafford a Pulitzer Prize."}, {"userName": "Ebirdy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6135779-ebirdy", "userReview": "Although I tend to gravitate toward big, meaty novels when I look for something to read, I am in awe of short story writers. To be able to weave an entire story in only 10 or 15 pages (sometimes less) that leaves the reader feeling completely satisfied is just amazing. Jean Stafford is a master at this - she can sketch a complete scene is just a few well-chosen words. She also had me reaching for the dictionary, which I love - nothing like adding a few new words to my Scrabble vocabulary! Stafford's descriptions of social settings - both high society and low - are beautifully done throughout the various sections of the book.I read one of her most well-known stories, In the Zoo last night. What an ending - it left me shaking my head both at the storyline and at Stafford's skill as a writer. The Echo and The Nemesis was another story where the ending had an unexpected twist - again, just a few brief words but they left you shaken. In The Healthiest Girl in Town her depiction of the main character's childhood anxiety and thoughts were wonderful, and marked with Stafford's wry humor.I think most everyone would enjoy at least some of the stories in this collection. Not every one is a diamond, but all of them are jewels in their own way. I think Stafford is one of the \"must read\" authors, especially for anyone who has to do much writing of their own (for any reason) - you can learn a lot about good, concise writing from her work."}, {"userName": "amy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8384-amy", "userReview": "Her stories remind me of a crisp autumn day, where everything is beautiful but twisted and cold and dying at the same time.

Ever.There's only one real dud in this volume, but the rest are so spectacularly good, you'll probably forgive it, as I did.Be careful not to read Stafford's stories while also reading a blowhardy, overwordy novel.

And those are her best stories. But she also wrote about kids growing up in the West and all sorts of social awkwardness found outside of society parties, too. A good 75% of these stories are best described as \"painful,\" but they're pretty wonderful, too."}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6262367-abby", "userReview": "\u201cOf course it could not have happened like this: falling in love is not an abrupt plunge; it is a gradual descent, seldom in a straight line, rather like the floating downward of a parachute.\u201d (from \"Caveat Emptor\")Jean Stafford: A forgotten American treasure.

As the two paragraphs below suggest, I think the stories are well-written, but suffer from an almost clinical detachment on the author's part. So, only three stars.Interim review:I've been dipping into this collection sporadically over the last month or so, and my reaction is ambivalent. I admire these stories a lot - insert appropriate verbiage along the lines of 'tightly constructed', 'keen eye', 'extraordinary evocation of a sense of place', the usual nuggets of reviewer approval. yes, indeedy, ms Stafford sure can write. Yada, yada.So why don't I enjoy these stories more? Why does it feel like more of a chore than a pleasure to return to this collection? Maybe it has something to do with the author's detachment towards her characters.

Too much hopeless boredom for these ladies trapped by circumstance and society left me feeling short of breath and a little panicky.I wish I could read the stories she must have written about cussy floozies getting rage drunk at bars, lashing out at all the wrongs done upon her in the past.looking forward to checking out \"the mountain lion\"."}, {"userName": "Erin Digmon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61526707-erin-digmon", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this collection of short stories.

The tone of some stories remind me of Dorothy Parker, but with less dark humor and more introspective bleakness, heavier on the physical and emotional description. It's not the specifics of the where, when, and who of the stories that grab - it's the unsettling feelings, amorphous not quite depression, or pessimism, not quite happiness or loneliness - like that one moment when you suddenly don't want to be at a party, and there are hours before you can leave."}, {"userName": "Randi Minetor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4497543-randi-minetor", "userReview": "This book is so beautifully written that the short story format became strangely unsatisfying. So many of the stories barely get started before Stafford ended them, leaving me feeling a little abused\u2014I had just gotten to know these characters, and their tale was over. I couldn't help but hearken back to my creative writing classes in high school and college, when we were taught that a story has a beginning, a middle and an end\u2014a conflict presented and resolved to the reader's satisfaction. Many of these stories established fascinating characters, presented a conflict, and then stopped before the conflict could be addressed, much less resolved. The notable exceptions in this collection were two stories in which young Emily Vanderpool is the protagonist, and these played out in a fashion worthy of Harper Lee, bringing the story full circle with near-hilarious consequences. In fact, all of the stories that took place in Adams, Colorado were among the strongest in the collection.

Yet, it is so smoothly written that I didnt find it boring. Although I had no problem setting it down I didn't mind picking it up again and wandering back into Stafford's world. What I did find however, is that her stories though not unpleasant were almost entirely forgettable for me. Not only was I generally uninterested in the characters, but I could not say what a single story was about after reading it.

However reading about her tragic life (a roommate that committed suicide, 3 marriages, drug and alcohol addiction) put the writing in context.That being said she does a great job of a complete story in less than 20 pages (mostly) and I found most of them fast reads - although at times it seemed she was showing off with her vocabulary (wish I had read this on the Kindle with the built in dictionary)."}, {"userName": "Zac Frank", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24629-zac-frank", "userReview": "I read Stafford's story, \"Children Are Bored On Sunday\" when it was featured by the New Yorker from the archive and completely fell in love with it.
