It just gets better and better. Let's go say hi to the old folks on the farm, shall we? Mad magicians, all! :)Original review:I've said it before, but I'll say it again: the juxtapositions are delightful. This time we've got a smidge of Doctor Who, a smudge of Cthulhu, spy fiction, and humorous red tape.

There is humour, as usual. There is Howard's ingenuity, as usual. But it all takes place at an asylum.

The three novella/short stories are \u201cDown on the Farm (Laundry Files #2.5),\u201d \u201cEquoid (Laundry Files #2.9),\u201d and \u201cOvertime (Laundry Files #3.5).\u201d Two of the stories are in the field and the third is set at HQ with a Christmas theme. Each starts slow, but they all get better the further in you get. All of them are quick, engaging reads, although Stross continues to be enamored with computing jargon and the vernacular of the Laundry\u2019s trade. I plan to continue reading this series.In \u201cDown on the Farm\u201d Howard investigates a message reporting patient abuse at the \u2018Farm,\u2019 a facility to help Laundry agents recover from mental breakdowns or to provide long term care.

Very clever play on the sad affliction of Alzheimer's, wrapped very carefully in the subtext of the story on how we so easily hospitalise people who we cannot help.

It clocks in at 74 ereader screens; it's hardly long enough to get a story going, let alone developed and resolved. There's a very long setup and then a super quick resolution which left me just a little puzzled - I won't give anything away but I feel the solution to the problem isn't consistent with the \"rules\" of the Laundry Files world. We did learn some more arcane trivia about the history of the Laundry, but we didn't learn very much about Bob Howard and the \"mystery\" aspect of the story leaves some huge gaps that aren't adequately explained. That being said, the writing is crisp and elegant which I appreciate after the clumsiness of The Rhesus Chart.A weak 3.5; it was enjoyable enough for fans of the Laundry Files but doesn't offer very much for people just coming into the series."}, {"userName": "Daniel Bratell", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5919112-daniel-bratell", "userReview": "Short story which starts by Bob getting assigned to take a look at the \"Funny Farm\", where the burned out and crazy laundry employees end up.

The funny farm! Haha! Ah...that's really the only joke in this story, and that is just fine with me. The setting is interesting enough! The plot revolves around a British secret agency which works to keep demonic and otherwise otherworldly forces at bay. Quite difficult, when these forces can be summoned by something as simple as written-down mathematics. Or even more basic things.Our narrator heads off to the agency's psych ward to investigate a distress letter which should not have been able to escape the ward's walls. He finds an institution run by unsettling automatons and nearly-powerless human guards, as well as inmates who hold dangerous power.I'd recommend this, quite certainly. It was a great little story.

This one seems to take place before the Fuller Memorandum, but the time is not easy to place as this series advances. While there's a brilliant One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest meets Lovecraft set up here and some great dialogue, the whole piece seems rushed and the ending a little too abrupt. Unlike the meal that Concrete Jungle and Overtime provided as two better Bob Howard stories, this one is more like a tasty but unsatisfying tapa plate. The titular \"Funny Farm\" is an interesting slice of the Laundry universe, and one alluded to in the other books, but the conclusion of Bob Howard's wild visit to it is a little half-baked. All the same, pitting Bob Howard against a demon trapped in an old mainframe computer with a bunch of lunatics in the crossfire is never really a bad idea."}, {"userName": "Fred Reinheimer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32811415-fred-reinheimer", "userReview": "A Quick Trip to the LaundryNot formally speaking a \"book\", but rather a 30 or so page short.
