Where to begin. For those of you who have followed all her series and other books involving \u201cThe Hollows\u201d, this one is a BIG deal. No spoilers here, but there is major character and plot development. I\u2019ve read almost all of Lisa Unger\u2019s books; I was first hooked when I picked up a copy of Fragile in the B&N clearance section and she quickly became one of my top 10 authors to read after devouring Beautiful Lies, Sliver of Truth, Black Out, & Die For You. I\u2019ve read all her other books as well, save for her Whispers novellas (which I now realize is a huge mistake that I must remedy immediately; it really could have made my experience with this book just that extra bit perfect).\u201cMillions of spiritual creatures walk the earthUnseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.\u201d-John Milton, Paradise LostIn this book (which some would consider Book 3 in The Hollows series) we are reunited with Jones Cooper (former detective with Hollows PD and now freelance private investigator) and Eloise Montgomery (psychic and assistant to Jones Cooper in solving multiple past cases in The Hollows), but we are also introduced to a new character, Finley Montgomery, who is Eloise\u2019s granddaughter. She has come to live with Eloise in an attempt to learn how to control her own psychic powers if you will. In an attempt to not rehash the book\u2019s plot blurb, Finley discovers an overwhelming sound (Squeak, Clink) that will not leave her alone. She discovers this one is calling her, not Eloise, to come and solve the mystery with Jones.\u201cThe girl was of this place; she belonged here more than she knew\u2026 She was unpredictable and wild, powerful, foolish, stubborn, like many children The Hollows had known.\u201dI loved, loved, LOVED this character Finley! She was a spitfire; tatted and wild with a quiet streak that works in conjunction with her ultimate stubbornness. This girl isn\u2019t going to be pushed into doing anything she doesn\u2019t want to (at least in the physical world). She has regular \u201cguests\u201d (as I like to call them) that she sees and hears daily, but also new ones that pop up along the way. I also loved the relationship between her and (boyfriend-ish?) Rainer. I could picture them easily in my mind as if watching a movie and was a little sad to leave them when the book ended.\u201cOur choices, even the small ones, all have consequences.\u201dThis book was intense. It was what I would consider genre-bending; yes there are paranormal elements but it was just as solid as any book I would read in the crime/thriller genre. I don\u2019t typically read supernatural books, but Lisa\u2019s have always felt so real that I can\u2019t help but get caught up in them. I can see why some threw in the Horror element, as the content was a bit disturbing but in a very realistic way (think Karin Slaughter in some of her graphic content/violence). Very little sexual content in this one, which I was very pleased with, as this book needed the continual flow of the story without that extra distraction.\u201cThe woods are lovely, dark and deep,But I have promises to keep.And miles to go before I sleep.\u201d-Robert Frost, Miles to GoI know I said no spoilers, and I won\u2019t spoil, but I have to warn you there are some big shocks at the ending regarding the direction of the series. I was so engrossed that I stayed up well past midnight finishing and read 70% of the book in one sitting because I just couldn\u2019t put it down. There are some seriously emotional moments, but I\u2019m not mad; I felt they were for the bettering of the story and needed to happen. Big twists and turns guys; this is one of those stories that all the clues are in front of you from well near the beginning and its fun trying to piece them together after the big revelation of whodunit. If you are a fan of the series, PLEASE don\u2019t miss this book! Its extremely crucial and addictive. I\u2019m assuming there will be a follow up of some sort (PLEASE LISA DON\u2019T LET ME DOWN) from the ending; I think we are just getting to know Finley in what will turn into a long, exciting adventure. Highly recommended! Go pre-order, buy it, request it at your library; get your hands on it! If you\u2019re new to the series, go pick up Fragile and start there.\u201cYou cannot hide in the snowNo matter where you goYou leave a trail behindThat anyone can find.\u201d-Anonymous\u201cYour vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart.

Eloise is a psychic and works with the police department at times. Finley keeps hearing this sound in her head and she has to fight to get it out.

She hasn't done anything like this before and the things she sees has her crazy with worry. She wants to find Abbey, but what she and Jones eventually find is worse than what they could have ever imagined. Finley finds a lot of ghosts in those woods. But will she find Abbey?I really enjoyed this book! I was on the edge of my seat many times yelling \"Go, Go, Go! Hurry.\"It was a tough and sad revelation all around. There was a twist that I should have seen, don't they always do that? When they find out the whole story though, it's just so very sad. But don't let that stop you.

Sorta see dead peopley. Finley is a pretty decent character..she has funky hair, drives a motorcycle, has tattoos all over. I liked her.

Not only is this particular sound a daily visitor that rests within her mind, but she sees the likes of a young boy playing with a train on the floor and three evasive young sisters that drift in and out of her field of vision like flames in a cluster of candles. Finley now harbors these abilities through the lifeblood vein of her grandmother, Eloise. She's moved in lock, stock, and barrel with Eloise in the small town of The Hollows. The Hollows keeps guarded secrets in which only those privy to its elusive ways can know. Finley's boyfriend, Rainer, has moved to the tiny town to be with her.When a young girl is missing during a hike with her father and brother in The Hollows woods, Finley is drawn to the area. Both father and son were shot and the girl disappeared into thin air. Jones Cooper, a detective who sometimes works closely with Eloise's psychic abilities, is hired by the girl's mother. But Eloise is not getting much feedback on the missing girl while Finley's abilities have intensified. Finley wears confusion, frustration, and perplexity like badges sewn onto a personal banner. Nothing definitive comes through as to whether this young girl is still alive or has suffered a horrendous fate.This is my first book by Lisa Unger. She certainly fries \"eerie\" up in a pan and serves it well. Her characters just about lift themselves off the page. I particularly liked Finley with her pink and black hair and motorcycle attitude. Unger's descriptors of the woodsy area lend themselves to vivid visuals for the readers. You see, you hear, and you almost touch the earthy surroundings.If you are looking for something outside of the usual boundaries of your reading appetite, this one should readily fit the bill.

For some reason I thought a bazillion of my friends had read this, but it turns out only Jess has. I should probably go get a CAT scan or MRI at this point to find out what the hell is wrong with me. Anywho, I had never read Lisa Unger before (I actually also thought this was a debut because broken brain \u2013 whoops). I do, however, read a lot of mystery/thrillers and will admit that I have become pretty hard to please. Lately everything has seemed to be a knockoff of the latest Lifetime Movie of the Week (*cough Girl on the Train cough*) so I was more than happy with the end result of Ink and Bone.The main character here was a young woman named Finley. Finley isn\u2019t like everyone else \u2013 she sees dead people . . . and so does her grandmother Eloise. Finley lives in a place called The Hollows, which just so happens to be the place where a little girl went missing while on vacation with her (dysfunctional) parents. The girl\u2019s parents have never given up hope in finding her, even after months of searching. Their Hail Mary pass is a private detective, who just so happens to occasionally work with Eloise. However, once Finley starts hearing the \u201csqueak-clink\u201d noise it becomes clear she is the one who might be able to help solve the crime.Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooh doggy. This was mystery/thriller just the way I like it. Most of the time the \u201cwhodunit\u201d part is fairly easy to figure out, so I enjoy knowing who the bad guy is/having a dual timeline type of narrative and the psychic aspect was done well instead of coming off campy like it easily could have. There was even a little twist-a-roo that I didn\u2019t see coming. To top it all off, although this is not marked as part of a series it could easily become one \u2013 AND I WOULD ACTUALLY READ #2!

I think you are referring to Ink and Bone.Damn, Are you a psychic too?\nEverybody knows everybody in the Hollows.\nStrap in and take a ride to the Hollows, a low key creepy town with some low key tourist attractions. Young Abbey, along with her brother and father went hiking in Hallows, only to get attacked by two mystery men. Abbey was taken by these men, leaving her brother and father injured. This leads to a huge collective effort to find her, but even though the volunteers and police combed the forest and nearby areas, they were unable to find any clue.That was ten months ago.Finley is psychic like her Grandmother Eloise. When Abbey's mother exhausted her options, she hires Private detective Jones Cooper and Eloise to find her daughter. And Eloise, with her infinite psychic wisdom, escalates this case to Finley.\nWill they find her? \n The book uses three different groupings of POVs to tell the story. One belongs to Finely and her gang, another focuses on the family of Abbey and the last one belongs to Penny, an abducted girl.I did like parts focusing on Finley and Jones. It was a shame that Unger decided not to give Jones a POV. His character was the most likable and comfortable one in this book. Our main character, Finley, who is a teen psychic who rides a Motorbike and paints hair body with tattoos might sound like a perfect character to irritate the reader with \"I did not ask for these powers\" existential crisis, but I am happy to say that Unger pulled it off. The back stories and her relationship with Eloise were a delight to read.But to counter all these good POVs, we have Abbey's family and their stories which tend to be overlong, unnecessary and pointless in the end. We get an impression about Abbey's family initially and the later chapters solidify that very impression without providing any depth.Also, some of the plot elements were predictable towards the end. The story neither pushes the limits of paranormal nor takes any risks with the mystery of missing girls. With Penny's POV, author banishes most of the mystery surrounding the abduction. Also, the story introduces a fascinating idea connected to hollows, but to my disappointment, the author decided not to pursue it in depth.Overall, Ink and Bone is a likable story with some fascinating ideas and characters.

So much so that before they knew it they were way ahead of him.

Eloise had an unusual gift and her twenty year old granddaughter Finley had inherited the same gift. Finley had been eight years old when she started noticing things happening to her which were difficult to explain. Now it seemed she would be able to turn this gift to helping others.

Even though it had already been ten months, she felt an urgency she couldn\u2019t explain. Would Finley be able to find the necessary answers? Or was it already too late?Ink and Bone by Lisa Unger is an absolutely brilliant, mind-boggling psychological thriller (with paranormal elements) that I could not put down!

Reading this book, I felt like I'd been dropped in the middle of an ongoing saga, like there's a whole lot of back story I should already know. Besides that, there just seemed to be so much going on, so many subplots and characters, so many POVs, that it made me dizzy.The main storyline involves the kidnapping of a young girl while the family was vacationing in The Hollows, New York. Ten months later, the distraught parents return to the area and hire a private detective, who's aided by a young woman with psychic ability. While I was drawn in by the premise, especially the paranormal elements, the story was too disjointed and confusing for me. One reason could be that I listened to this book on audio, which makes it harder to keep all of the layers straight.

Unger can somehow make the paranormal seem normal to the point where I was constantly reminding myself \"this is fiction, this is fiction, this is fiction\" so I wouldn't be so scared. This is one super creepy story - prepare for a heart-pounding, fast-paced read. I actually had to turn all the lights on while reading this at night.I feel like I should put in a warning: there is some non graphic violence against children. If you're sensitive to this material you may want to stay away - it is difficult to read at times. I am generally very wary of this subject matter, so I felt the need for a disclaimer.This book is not part of a series, but is set in The Hollows, a common thread in several of Unger's other books.

And taken as a whole, I liked way more things about it than I disliked. But the things I disliked I really disliked so I decided not to round up to 4 stars.This is my first Lisa Unger book, though friends of mine have read a lot of her books and quite enjoyed them. This book will definitely appeal to fans of Gillian Flynn and Tana French, but other than a few kick ass characters, some sprinkling of a more supernatural storyline, and a few themes that I found unique, there really isn't a ton about this to elevate it past a typical mystery/thriller, at least for me.That isn't to say that it wasn't enjoyable. It was.Basic synopsis:Finley Montgomery has just moved to The Hollows, a small community in upstate New York where her mother was born and raised. She moved from Seattle, so this was more than just a hop, skip, and a jump away. Several reasons exist for this move, but primarily they are:1-She doesn't get along with her mother.2-She needs to get away from her ex-boyfriend, Rainer.3-She has a few supernatural/psychic abilities that she can neither control nor fully understand and wants to learn more about how to do both of those things.4-Her beloved grandmother Eloise lives there and is also a psychic.Finley comes to learn that no two psychics are the same, and her abilities manifest themselves very differently from her grandmother's. Eloise's abilities mostly manifest themselves as premonitions or futuristic visions, whereas Finley can see and communicate with lost souls (or ghosts as we humans call them). Finley has a hard time trying to figure out how to use her abilities and what to do with them once she figures them out. She follows in her grandmother's footsteps by helping out local detective Jones Cooper with cases of abductions, homicides, and other mysteries he tries to solve. Finley is happy to help, but becomes frustrated in trying to figure out what to do (as her abilities aren't always reliable, nor do they always spell everything out cleanly). When Cooper picks up a case from a distraught mother whose little girl Abby was abducted from the Hollows almost a year before, Finley believes that she's receiving signs that she should help. And so she does.I loved Finley. She is a total gem of a character. She's kick ass and rough around the edges, and flawed and relatable and vulnerable and fierce all at once. She wears her hair short, spiky, and hot pink, rides a Harley Davidson, and has less natural skin showing than skin covered in ink. Her image is a source of a major contention with her mother Amanda, but Finley is very comfortable in her own skin and for the most part doesn't try to hide who she is. She also has several reasons for her image, the primary one being that she \"wants her outside to match her insides.\" You see, being a psychic isn't all its cracked up to be and seeing ghosts is a really hard thing to deal with. Finley tries to use her gifts to help save those who may be lost, bring lost souls home, or bring justice to families waiting for some to be served. But what happens to all those she can't save? She is the one haunted by them, unable to let them go, the one who sees them every single day, knowing that she failed. As Finley's abilities surfaced as a child, she had to endure therapy, being different, thinking she was a freak, her mother calling her a liar, refusing to admit that Finley shares the same fate with her own mother Eloise, with whom Amanda has been estranged for most of her adult life. Tattooing her body is Finley's way of coping, her own version of masochism, the physical sharing of pain that torments her insides. Every tattoo is a rendering of a person who has haunted her in her lifetime. Sharing her skin with them is a way of etching each and every one onto her very soul. The artist who works on Finley is her ex boyfriend, Rainer, who followed her across the country, took a job tending bar at the local pub while setting up his own tattoo parlor. I also enjoyed Finley and Rainer's story and though it is a far cry from a perfect romance, found their intimacy to be believable and sincerely deep.\nThere was a deep intimacy to ink work, especially when he worked with Fin. He saw what she wanted him to see. And when he put the needle to her skin and inked those images onto her flesh, he was closer to her than he was at any other time. She trusted him, opened herself to him. she let him mark her body with total faith in their connection. Even when their other connections--as lovers and friends--were strained, that remained.\nFinley and her story was my absolute favorite part of this novel and her parts read effortlessly. I actually hope that this book may be the start of a series of novels featuring Finley and her growth into her abilities. *Fingers crossed*Also sharing page time was the perspective of the kidnapped girl, living among her captors who call her Penny. There is a rawness here than almost reminds me of grit lit, or appalachian noir. Her captors are those who live off the grid, hate technology, and are just a little off from the rest of the town. As the story of who they are and why she was taken unfold, the depth of the novel unfolds.The third and fourth perspectives are those of the abducted girls parents, Wolf and Merri. Merri is distraught with grief and finds herself completely unable to move on until she finds out what happened to her little girl. Wolf is just as upset by the loss, and has had to cope with all the changes that day brought to him (he and his son were both shot the day Penny was taken) but has more or less tried to move on. He worries that Merri is only going to hurt herself, that the longer she takes to get over it, the further she retreats into darkness where her own demons dwell. Merri blames herself for what happened. Her daughter was abducted while on a hike with her father and older brother, a hike in which Merri was not present, for reasons that become more evident at the story progresses. She and Wolf have separated, due partly to the abduction and partly due to Wolf's chronic infidelity. I got both perspectives, and I have to say, these parts were the parts that presented the most problems. I disliked both Merri and Wolf and hated sharing headspace with them. Their constant dilemmas about the upcoming divorce, Wolf's girlfriend, their love for each other which is still not completely gone just grated on me. I didn't care about the divorce. I didn't care about them. I found both completely self-centered and annoying. Merri was unreasonable and cold. Wolf was childish and arrogant. And can I say AGAIN how overused and trite the marital infidelity angle is in every single mystery/thriller on the market? Why does every single couple affected by tragedy have to have some sort of secret life? I only found sympathy for Merri when she described her aching need to find out what happened, even if it leads to the inevitable bad news.\nthe most stressful condition for the human mind is simply not knowing. Even if the worst thing happens, the mind recovers eventually, returns to its natural baseline of happiness. But the wondering, the crushing weight of disappointments, the violent swing between poles of hope and despair It's almost more than a person can endure.\nI think moving on is a really important theme in this book, one that is central to Merri and Wolf but which also makes appearances throughout the novel. Constantly thinking back to what might have been or how things could be different isn't going to bring a person back. Or help you move on. Or allow the good memories of those we lose to linger. Nothing healthy can ever come by trying to keep a person alive who simply is not alive any more.There is a twist at the end which I did figure out, but which I liked anyway. I think I figured it out more due to the author's heavy handed hinting and not due to the fact that it was expected or predictable.So at the end, it was an enjoyable, but somewhat typical ride. The supernatural bits were better than the typical mystery/thriller bits, but both worked out well in the end. The Hollows itself kind of became its own character which kinda tied into the Appalachian noir tone that made its way through the storyline, and that was a nice touch. I recommend this for a quick thriller which includes a decent amount of different added to the \"been there done that.\"3.5 starsI received an ARC of this novel from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Ink & Bone by Lisa Unger is a 2016 Touchstone publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. Having read the three short stories which are preludes to this full length novel, I had a little background about \u2018The Hollows\u2019 and the three generations of women empowered with psychic powers, each one coping in different ways. Finley represents the third generation, but is less than thrilled by her gift and the responsibility of it. However, when a case comes to her attention which involves a missing girl, Finley gets sucked into the search whether she wants to or not. I immediately liked Finley, the inked, motorcycle riding wild child, who is not afraid to speak her mind. As conflicted as she is about her future and the emotional drama she will face by accepting her psychic abilities, she does the right thing, and perhaps even learns to not only accept her fate, but embrace it, with a fierceness neither her grandmother or mother ever could. I have some mixed emotions about the story, although it has all the elements needed for an atmospheric chiller, and even came with a few Gothic undertones, which I loved. Everything clicked along nicely with the suspense building with each chapter, the mystery solidifying, and the characters developing, becoming clearer, sharper, and stronger and the story progressed. But, the conclusion, while tense and emotional, lost ground, becoming a little murky, confusing, and with some threads not completely explained or fully closed, leaving me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. I would love to delve into that cryptic opinion, but doing so would give too much away. Despite feeling a little let down and sad by the way some things turned out, I was pleased by the characterizations, the ultimate feeling of closure, and the promise of new beginnings. Finley is a character I will look forward to hearing from again, as she perfects her natural talent and uses it to help others.

Because of those that take place in The Hollows, I knew to expect supernatural elements in this book. I was familiar with psychic Eloise Montgomery and PI Jones Cooper and The Hollows. Eloise's granddaughter, Finley, also has a psychic gift. She's not sure she wants it, would like to control it on her terms, and is learning what it means. She's tough, troubled, and terrified, and turns to Rainer, a tattoo artist who followed Finley from Seattle. I really liked these two characters.The book is beautifully and sensitively written. It's eerie, but not scary. Girls are missing. Their bodies have never been found, but their families still hope. Finley slowly accepts that she has to help, needs to help. The story is told from multiple points of view, including one feisty little girl named Penny. The conclusion leads me to believe there is more for Finley to do in the future in The Hollows, but there is no cliffhanger."}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36817401-carrie", "userReview": "Twenty year old Finley Montgomery has grown up being visited by people who others can't see and haunted by prophetic dreams. She has no control over what's going on with her and is lost with no one to understand it. Her mother had taken her away from the Hollows and her grandmother Eloise Montgomery but now Finley knows it's time to return and learn how to control her psychic abilities. Merri Gleason's husband, Wolf, surprised the family with a trip to the Hollows. While Wolf was out hiking with the kids they were attacked and Wolf and his son were shot while their daughter Abbey was taken. Now several months later and down to her last bit of hope Merri has decided to hire detective Jones Cooper who sometimes works with psychic Eloise Montgomery. Eloise and her granddaughter find themselves caught up in trying to solve Abbey's disappearance. Ink and Bone is part of a series of books by Lisa Unger that feature the Hollows and former detective now turned investigator Jones Cooper and psychic Eloise Montgomery. This is the first of these books I've read and I do believe it read fine as a standalone novel. This would be another definite page turner of a book as you follow along with a wide range of characters looking to solve the disappearances at the place called the Hollows. Finley is a rather colorful character as she's grown up dealing with these powers all on her own and now finding herself with her grandmother. The family of the missing girl all had their own struggles as they have tried to cope and not fall apart each day that their daughter has been missing. I loved the added touch of the paranormal brought into this thriller. Different from your normal follow the clues that police or investigators find in a read we are following along with Finley and her visions which even she sometimes doesn't know what is real or not. Overall, an engaging thriller with paranormal psychic elements. Interesting case with interesting characters involved. One that I'd recommend checking out.

Haunting. Tense. It took just two days of spare-time reading to finish this book, and on the second, anyone who even thought about prying my Kindle out of my hands would have regretted it. My sweet husband, bless his heart, knows better than to try - even though it meant he had to fetch take-out for dinner.Ironically, I almost didn't read it at all. When I had a chance to get it from the publisher (via NetGalley) in exchange for an unbiased review, I of course read the description and editorial reviews. Twisty psychological suspense? Check. Prophetic dreams? Maybe. Supernatural? You've got to be kidding. In the end, though, my sense of nothing ventured, nothing gained won out. And within the first couple of chapters, the author won me over.On the surface, this is a story about Abbey, a young girl who has been missing for 10 months, and Finley Montgomery, a tattoo-covered 20-year-old who \"sees\" and \"feels\" people and things no one else does - with the exception of her grandmother Eloise. The grandmother, in fact, is a well-known psychic in The Hollows, a secluded New York community. Finley is staying with Eloise over the objections of her mother, who wants nothing to do with the town in which she once lived and even less with her mother, Eloise, whom she fears might encourage Finley to explore their shared \"gift.\"Abbey was taken while her parents and younger brother were vacationing in The Hollows. Her father took the kids on a hike in the woods, where both he and his son were shot. Alive but unable to move, they watched as a man dragged a screaming Abbey away. Understandably, the incident tore the family apart and traumatized the young boy. In desperation, Abbey's mother Merri decides to return to the scene of the abduction and hires a local detective, who happens to work occasionally with Eloise, in hopes of finding her daughter. If that were all there were to it, I suppose the story could be told in a handful of chapters. And certainly, there are plenty of thrills and chills as details of what really happened are revealed. But the real intrigue lies in the complexity of the characters - and it is here that the writing really shines. Chapter by chapter, layers are peeled back and we see the good, the bad and the downright ugly as well as everyone's \"connections\" to the living, the dead and the...well, just read the book."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara", "userReview": "2.5 starsTen months after her daughter Abbey was abducted during a vacation in 'The Hollows,' Merri Gleason returns to the upstate New York town. Desperate to find out what happened to her daughter, Merri hires cop turned private investigator Jones Cooper - who usually works with psychic Eloise Montgomery. This time, however, Eloise's gifted granddaughter Finley is getting paranormal 'messages' about the case.Finley recently moved to The Hollows to be close to her supportive grandmother and to get away from her difficult mom and unfaithful beau. However Finley's cheating boyfriend Rainer followed her to town, hoping to redeem himself. Nevertheless Finley concentrates on her college classes and keeps Rainer at a distance - aside from going to his tattoo parlor to get inked. As the story unfolds there are flashbacks to the Gleason family before and after the kidnapping. We learn that Merri's husband Wolf was having an affair that affected his judgment and behavior. The flashbacks alternate with what's going on in the present, including Cooper's investigation; Finley's psychic experiences; and accounts of a girl called Penny, who's being held prisoner by a hillbilly family. During his inquiries Cooper discovers that, over the years, several girls have disappeared from The Hollows. WE learn that all these girls had some psychic abilities. And that's about all I can say without spoilers. For me this isn't one of Lisa Unger's best books. The Penny parts are disturbing and slow down the story too much; the police investigations (prior to Cooper being hired) are inept; Merri and Finley are too 'understanding' of their cheating men - who should be cut loose immediately and forever; and the hillbilly people are more like caricatures than real humans. Moreover, the story's ending isn't quite satisfying. Though I'm not a big fan of this book I'd probably read other stories by Unger.

I have never read anything by Lisa Unger before, which is exciting because not only does she have more books out there, but others in this same setting with overlapping characters! Love finding new (to me) authors.I personally have no reservations when it comes to the theme of psychic abilities, which is a major one here, but I really think this book is written solidly enough that even for a complete non-believer it would still be a great read.I felt like all of the characters had a credibility (and a complexity) to them and felt pretty real. The writing itself was something I really admired and I would often re read parts because they were so pretty or articulate or both. I especially liked the relationship between the main character and her on again off again boyfriend and the one between Eloise and Cooper. Although I felt there were certain moments where a new paragraph would begin and it wasn't immediately clear whose perspective we were now hearing from and some slight moments that were confusing in other ways and didn't quite gel for me, they were the minority by far.Overall I would give this a 4.5/5Really well done.

From voices, ghosts,  spirits, evil, visions, monsters, whispers, graveyards, voices, trains, birds, death, torture, abuse, grief, identity, obsessions, prophetic dreams, imaginary friends, and the mysteries of human psyche.

She especially loves her Daddy; however, he seems to be often distracted by his phone (no kidding)!. Dad was not supposed to be talking on his cell phone (porn or sexting) during their special outing on a hiking trail, while enjoying the nature and birds. A tragedy occurs, dad and brother are hurt, and she was taught to run. However, she was not fast enough. The men have caught her. All is turning black. Finley Montgomery (Eloise\u2019s granddaughter), twenty-years old, (with her tattoos and motorcycle) is center stage in Ink and Bone. Picking up from the last installment, she is moving to The Hollows, New York and lands in the middle of a dangerous investigation involving a young girl who has been missing for ten months, and the police have all but given up hope.There were 9,780 living souls populating The Hollows. There were good people and bad ones, people with secrets and dark appetites, happy people, and people buckling under the weight of grief and sorrow. There were people who were looking for things --and loved ones they had lost--people hiding. Lost people trying to find their way home. Each of them connected to the others in ways that were obvious, or as hidden as the abandoned mine tunnels beneath the ground. Each had his purpose and his place in The Hollows. Finley\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Rainer from Seattle had followed her, now tending bar at Jake\u2019s Pub, a cop hangout. She does not need the distraction. However, he keeps showing up.Merri Gleason,  Abbey\u2019s mother has been hooked on pills, an unfaithful husband, Wolf (narcissistic-what a jerk), an OCD son, Jackson, and a daughter, Abbey \u2013 still missing. A bad marriage. After a weekend mountain lake house getaway trip to the Hollows\u2014her life turned into a nightmare. The enormous unthinkable tragedy that ultimately blew them to smithereens. After ten months she has to try everything to find her daughter. They had spent money, had news conferences, searches, volunteers, fliers, and manhunts. All had ceased and weathered away. Everyone had given up. She still blamed herself. Her husband, the Ivy League travel writer, adventurer\u2014educated man of the world (and skirt chaser) had taken the kids on a hiking trip to give her time by herself. The shooting of father and son, and her daughter was taken. Merri was living in fear and guilt\u2014the world had become such a crowded frenetic, and terribly lonely place. She has turned to  Jones Cooper PI (retired Hollows PD) and psychic Eloise Montgomery for help. She is desperate for answers. However, Eloise is not getting anything and turns it over to her granddaughter, Finley to work with Cooper. Eloise and Jones  had worked many cases with good success, their talents balancing and complementing each other. They had good energy. Merri has checked into Miss Lovely\u2019s Bed and Breakfast in The Hollows, a charming little guesthouse, where she felt safe, while she was determined to find her daughter. Finley and Eloise  were Listeners, people who heard (saw, and experienced) what other people couldn\u2019t. Someone like Jones was a Sensitive\u2014whether he knew it or not\u2014someone with sharp instincts with the ability to see right through the layers of person straight into the truth.There are similarities  between two cases \u2013The Gleasons and Fitzpatricks. Both families had come from Manhattan. Eliza age nine and a boy Joshua age fourteen. The Gleasons had hired other detectives and now a lot was riding on the case\u2014Finley was feeling the pressure pushing down. She did not disappear into visions like Eloise did, or actually communicate with the dead like Agatha Cross. She sort of did both, but sometimes there wasn\u2019t a lot of cohesion to what she experienced. Lines were blurred\u2014visions or reality. What did the dead want? The lost were getting restless and angry. The truth was Finley wasn\u2019t sure how she planned to use her gifts (Eloise was a slave to the gifts), and she was not sure she wanted this. Eloise had told her she was chosen. She was unsure she was ready.\u201cLife is an impossible twist of choice and circumstance, one rarely exists without the other.\u201dThe Whispers were usually quiet; however, at times they could be loud. A million voices telling their stories, the full rainbow of human experience\u2014birth and death, joy and grief, fear and love. A New York real estate developer visitor gets murdered, (wrong place-wrong time) people living off the grid- the townies call them \u201chill\u201d people. They felt the Hollows belonged to them. Folks who lived off the land. Masking themselves as normal people, coming into town. What monsters are hidden in the Hollows Woods? The underground minds? Hidden rooms. The pain givers, and the misery makers. Why are they taking and torturing innocent people? How could Abbey, and those other two children, this man, just disappear and not be found? Swallowing up innocent lives. The negative energy of The Hollows could not be denied. Missing persons, miscarriages, accidents, and unexplained events. Brutal murders, witch burnings, and horrible mining accidents. It was not always positive or negative, but always demands something of people like Finley. A place where people moved their families to get away from crime and the chaos of the big city, vacationing here for its natural beauty. We hear from Abbey,  Penny, and the evil monsters connected, in the deep woods, hiding their evil secrets. Flashing back and forth from Eloise, Finley, Jones, and characters and spirits from previous books --a race against time to find the monsters, who collect Dreamers, before they kill again. There are those trapped, and someone is holding them back so they cannot pass. Will they be heard? If you look hard enough at the facts, you will find the trail of evidence that leads you to the truth, no matter how ugly. People always thought the dead haunted the living, but sometimes it was the other way around. \u201cSomeone at peace has to show them the way out. Once negativity has been released, it won\u2019t attract anymore.\u201d Taking the haunted  characters of previous books,  The Three Sisters,  the victims of hatred and jealousy, The Burning Girl and her sister abused by their stepfather then murdered by their own mother, and Elsie another little girl drowned by her mother. The lost ones. Finley was buried under the weight of the terrible sadness\u2014each horrible moment of abuse, neglect, and murder which flashed before her eyes\u2014the horror. The lost girls. The brokenness. The screaming. Recommend reading  The Whispers #1 to learn about the background of Eloise and Finley. Loved Fatboy and Priss in  Crazy Love You. Unger definitely crosses  to the dark side with Ink and Bone,  with more supernatural crazies than I particularly care for (Not a fan of paranormal or horror); however, she is a superb storyteller. Definitely dark and disturbing\u2014so if you are looking for a feel good book, you need to look elsewhere. For me, some of the paranormal, horror, Gothic, and ghoulish took away from the overall suspense thriller side, I prefer. Since I have read  all the books and novellas in the series, was curious to see how things would end up with Eloise, Finley and the missing girl. Unger leaves the ending open to another installment which fans will look forward to. Not the ending I was hoping for.  Was intrigued how she ventured into this dark subject material.

She recently moved to The Hollows, a secluded town somewhere upstate New York, to live with her grandmother Eloise. Both, Eloise and Finley, have special gifts and Finley wants to understand more about these abilities so she can learn to control them better. Eloise has been working with private detectives to help locate missing people and is a very well-known psychic. But when PI Jones Cooper is contacted by Merri Gleason to help find her daughter Abbey, who was abducted nearly a year ago, Eloise feels it will be Finley\u2019s turn to assist.Just before listening to this, I listened to the three short stories The Whispers, The Burning Girl and The Three Sisters which provide a solid introduction to Eloise and Finley, their family and their abilities over a time span of 30 years, but I have never listened to/read any other books by Lisa Unger. This story, however, would work fine if you haven\u2019t read any previous books set in The Hollows, as there is sufficient background given.The story is told from various points of views, and I really enjoyed the relationship elements of the plot. The characters were very well developed and although some of them were not particularly likable, they were interesting. We find out how the victims\u2019 families are coping, or not, and there is a lot of depth to Finley and her relationship with her family and her ex-boyfriend who followed her to The Hollows. There are a few very emotional scenes towards the end that left me teary-eyed. The mystery aspect of the story was a bit of a disappointment, though. I was expecting more of an intense page-turner. There were a couple of twists, but otherwise, it was pretty much straightforward. Not being a massive fan of supernatural stories, the paranormal aspects took over too much for me in this one. I thought it was much better handled in the three short stories I listened to. How many \u2018special\u2019 people can you have in one small town?I think some of my disconnectedness is due to the narration. I believe this is the voice artist\u2019s first experience of narrating an audiobook. Hence, I hope that with continued experience she will gain a better feeling for making the narration flow and sound less stilted. With a large cast of characters such as in this book, it is immensely helpful if the narrator is able to differentiate voices and keep them consistent. It\u2019s kind of difficult to become immersed and gripped by the plot when you are listening to a monotonous voice for nearly 12 hours. The quality of the production was otherwise great.I gave the story 4 stars, the audiobook narration 3 stars. If this had been a more seasoned narrator, it would have been lower. I would recommend the book to all fans of paranormal fiction.Audiobook provided for review by the audiobookreviewer.com"}, {"userName": "Elle \u2726 Pretty Little Books \u2726", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44344367-elle-pretty-little-books", "userReview": "Release Date:  June 7, 2016 :: 5 Pretty Little Stars This is an intense and creepy psychological thriller that will haunt you through the night.
