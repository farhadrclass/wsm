It was a really long plane ride, but I slept a lot, so that's why I'm writing now and not yesterday. Mom and Dad said I had to go back to school today, and I'm really mad about that. I had to go to school at Grandpa's too, because I was there for so long. So when I went to school this morning and talked to the principal to get me back in, they told me something that really made me upset. Remember how they moved me to 4th grade when I was at Grandpa's? Well, they put me back in 3rd! I did so good when I was in 4th grade, but now I have to go backwards! I'm not stupid! It's not fair! I don't want to start over! I think Dad was really mad about it, but I don't know why, he doesn't have to go back to 3rd grade. Not bad, not the greatest I've read but curious enough to read the next installment to see what happens with Kellie.Kellie herself as a character: 4 stars Writing : 2.5 stars Plot: 3 stars"}, {"userName": "Farith", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31454912-farith", "userReview": "2 stars.I read this because it was actually free on Amazon Kindle. I kind of regret reading this. I kind of not.This short book is about this little girl who is normal and ordinary. She's in third grade and then every body in her classroom start getting sick. Later she will have to confront a zombie apocalypse.You can choose if you want to read Kellie's diary with her actual handwriting. It was the only original part of it.I didn't like this book. When I was reading it, I kinda enjoyed it because I wanted to know what was going to happen, but the final was so MEH that if I had had a physical copy of it, I would have thrown it against the wall. Nothing interesting happened in those 50 pages. The girl just kept saying that she was scared and yeah, we know that you're scared because you're between a zombie apocalypse, but GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER AND TRY TO SAVE YOUR DAMN LIFE! I was frustrated to death with this book.I don't really recommend it but if you like zombies you might like to give it a shot.So, again, I didn't like this at all and if I buy the next book is just because I want to know what happens next. Maybe you'll see the next book with two stars reviewed by me soon.OVERALL THOUGHTS:You can buy this book for FREE here."}, {"userName": "Sophie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20011429-sophie", "userReview": "Although this book has high ratings by other readers, I was one of the few who struggled to enjoy it.It was quite a short novel (which didn't bother me too much), but the way it was set out made it difficult to focus.

Kellie is a young child whose managed to survived through the beginning of a Zombie Apocalypse. Kellie having no other survivors to talk with shares all her fears and experiences with her diary \"barbie\". Be prepared though it is quite sad seeing all the death and destruction through a child's eyes but I'm telling you it is worth it in the end. Overall, Kellie's Diary is one of the most unique novellas I've read in awhile and I cannot wait to see more from this brave little girl. I highly recommend picking this one up and giving it a go. My only small little gripe about this novella was the fact I couldn't really tell it was set in the early 90's and based on the description that's supposed to be important. Does it ruin the book at all? No, but a few references here and their couldn't hurt either."}, {"userName": "Brittney", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10187943-brittney", "userReview": "I have been writing these graphic novel reviews for almost a year, and never have I encountered a book that was so misleading. Kellie\u2019s Diary does not fail due to a weak concept or bad anatomy. It fails because it breaks the only cardinal rule that can never be broken in any graphic novel of any genre: Kellie\u2019s Diary has no graphics.Kellie\u2019s Diary is a completely textual diary of a nine-year-old girl as she lives through the first stages of a zombie apocalypse. Altogether it is not a bad concept, but the writing within the diary does not seem like that of a nine-year-old. The syntax and observations are that of an adult with the odd phrase or misspelling in an attempt to make the work seem like that of a child. With no actual art to redeem this book, the reader is left completely dependent on the weak narration, which eventually becomes extremely annoying because of how broken-up and unbelievable it is.Kellie\u2019s Diary is meant to be a graphic novel representation of Kellie\u2019s Diary: Decay of Innocence by Thomas Jenner and Angeline Perkins. When I first picked it up, I thought it was odd that there was no illustrator or colourist listed, but now I understand why: the only \u201cgraphic\u201d quality to this graphic novel is that each page is made to look as if it has been handwritten and kept in the same journal.I would not recommend Kellie\u2019s Diary to anyone. Not only is it not a graphic novel, it\u2019s just plain boring to read.cross-posted from theotherpress.ca"}, {"userName": "Jessica Chancellor", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29242338-jessica-chancellor", "userReview": "I don't usually go for this type of writing style, but, surprisingly, I enjoyed it.This very much reads as if a nine-year-old girl was attempting to survive the start of the zombie apocalypse. A kid would not really know what's going on, what those things were, and would have a \"My parents will make it better\" mentality. Kellie just wanted to get home and make sure her parents and friends were okay, and even grabbed food for anyone else she may have found.The only downside I felt could have been improved was that there wasn't a strong enough sense of urgency in Kellie's writing. Someone that young, experiencing that kind of event would probably be much more terrified than let on. But this was helped by the fact that she felt that her diary was like a friend, and her talking to that friend gave her comfort. I also loved that she knew that those monsters were once people, and she felt sorry for them, not just terrified of them. And her heart went out to their families.Although It wasn't very long, I feel it was worth the time."}, {"userName": "Shadow Girl", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8180580-shadow-girl", "userReview": "This is the diary of a nine year old girl who is experiencing the very beginning of the zombie apocalypse, although she doesn't know that's what it is.

Genius. It's a real wonder to see how a child would see the start of the zombie apocalypse and I found myself stuck on every word, reading and reading, devouring the words that were placed on my Kindle. Jenner did something amazing here, taking something that is old and not so scary for us anymore, to something that sparks fear in use because now we see it from a child's point of view, we feel the fear that they are feeling, and it sparks that old childhood terror in ourselves of the things we were scared of.I do feel like the writing was weak at parts, which is why it lost a star, but at the same time, I'm not sure if it was because it was written by the point of view of a young child, or on Jenner's part as the author. Either way, it was a beautiful read, and I'm excited to read the rest of the series of Kellie's Diary. I recommend this to all zombie lovers because this is a refreshing perspective on the age old tale of zombies take over the world."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2867944-kelly", "userReview": "Interesting premise, slow start...After a brief (and unexplained) stay with her grandfather, Kellie has just returned to her third grade class. Not a day back, and already some of her classmates are falling ill - never to return. At first, everyone assumes it's \"just the flu\" - but by week's end, her entire town has been devoured by zombies. Kellie is sitting in class one morning when a scary man barges through the window and promptly bites the substitute teacher. Terrified and not a little confused, she hides in the girl's bathroom until the mayhem subsides. With no other destination in mind, she decides to try and find her way home. Along the way, she dutifully records her journey in her diary (\"Barbie\"). (For what it's worth, Kellie reminds me of a (very!) young Julie Grigio. To wit: \"They're [the zombies] scary, but they look sad too.\")When I first picked this up, I wasn't quite sure what to expect: Graphic novel? A narrative book presented in diary format? Or a combination of the two, a sort of faux diary complete with scribbles and drawings and assorted ephemera? As it turns out, the answer is closest to B, and it lends itself well to the Kindle format. The authors use a handwriting font to give the book a handmade feel, and the \"diary\" is written on lined notebook paper, complete with faint water stains. In contrast to titles that contain visual art, Kellie's Diary #1 is easy enough to read on the Kindle. There aren't any real pages, but Kindle tells me that there are 69 locations, if that helps. There are nine chapters, and the diary covers exactly one week in Kellie's life: January 18 through January 25, 1993. (Crossing my fingers for copious '90s references down the road!) In any case, the story is rather short; I finished it inside of an hour. The first installment in a episodic series can be tricky; you need to establish the plot and atmosphere quickly enough to draw the readers in, and engage them in the story so that they'll return for more. Exploring the zombie apocalypse through the eyes of a child (and a seemingly abandoned one, at that) is an interesting (if risky) approach. Since Kellie tells the story, the language necessarily falls somewhere around a third- or fourth-grade level - which isn't my usual cup of tea. Then again, this can be used to present a chilling contrast in future installments, when young Kellie will inevitably encounter some very adult situations. Though there isn't much action in Part 1, there's real potential here. Free on Amazon, Kellie's Diary #1 is the first of four books: Kellie's Diary 1 through 4. There's also a collection (the only one in the series also available in print), Kellie's Diary: Decay of Innocence, which gathers books 1 through 3, along with some bonus material. Decay of Innocence is printed in a more traditional font, so if ease of reading is a concern, I recommend picking that up in lieu of the single issues. http://www.easyvegan.info/2014/02/05/..."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2280231-jess", "userReview": "Written in journal style, this book shows the fictional story of a girl in search of her family. Kellie has a diary in which she makes entries about her daily happenings. Events in Kellie's Diary occur in the 90s, where this girl still in elementary school begins to write in this journal what she observes around her. As days go by, people with flu show in the population, as it is evidenced in the entries Kellie writes in the pages of her journal addressed to Barbie. The situation becomes difficult when she observes the first attacks and also, it is then that the story reaches its climax. The fight for survival starts for Kellie. Kellie with cunningness, intelligence and courage embarks on a journey to her home and to her family.It has been a while since I have read a book that was so amazing for its simplicity and way of presenting the plot\u2019s situation from the start. Journal entries are generated in a straightforward manner by presenting errors and corrections as a child would have written them in an effort to show their experiences as they are occurring. All entries except the first, are addressed at Barbie, name given to the journal by Kellie. When she composes each diary, Kellie writes as if she was sharing her feelings with a friend. This gives a sense of camaraderie to the interaction between Kellie and her \u200b\u200bdiary.Authors Thomas Jenner and Angeline Perkins manage to create a unique experience in this character. Kellie has to make decisions that even an adult would find difficult by fear and terror. This girl is bold and wise, has common sense and intelligence, reasons that provoke in me fast interest in the events surrounding this girl. I kept reading so I could know what she would do next. This book left me wanting to know more about Kellie and about the 90\u2019s as this decade is represented in Kellie's Diary. This is a series I want to continue reading during 2014."}, {"userName": "Eleanor Luhar", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45807885-eleanor-luhar", "userReview": "This was free in the Kindle store and despite not really knowing much about it, I decided I'd download it. It's the graphic novel version of the first part of this collection, which is also available as an ordinary novel. It's a short story, as I believe each individual story is.As this is only a really short part of the collection, and I don't want to spoil the story, I can't really tell you much. But it is written fantastically, really capturing the voice of a young child. It's based in the early nineties, when several children - and then teachers - start to fall ill and disappear. Kellie is later forced to fight for her life against the \"monsters\" - most commonly known as zombies. Yep, this is an apocalypse diary written by a small child, alone.Of course, being \"written by a child\" means that description - even spelling - is not great. But that is obviously intentional and adds to the overall effect of the book. This particular edition happens to be designed to look like a notebook too, as opposed to the ordinary text of a novel.I am really tempted to look into buying the whole collection. It really ends quite suddenly and unexpectedly, and I do want to know what happens to Kellie. Does she find her family? Does she even survive in the end?

A good read, but I have a small piece of advice: it\u2019s much easier to read the text-only version of the book. The graphic version can\u2019t be magnified, so I quickly abandoned it. The story itself, however, is highly entertaining. The zombie thing is the new craze, I know, and I\u2019ve never been crazy about zombies \u2013 but this isn\u2019t just a story about undead wind-up dolls. Mostly, it\u2019s the story of a terrified, sure-to-be traumatized little girl.
