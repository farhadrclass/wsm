They claim that this series is sexist, mainly because of the character of Hattie Durham. That is ridiculous, not only because such women exist in the world, but especially because there are other female characters (Chloe, for example) who do not behave in this manner. Additionally, there are male characters who have impure sexual motives as well. So, calling this book sexist is utterly unfounded. Secondly, they have called this book \"racist.\" Now that I didn't get at all, since race is not even mentioned in this book... so I can't fight fire with fire when there isn't any fuel. And lastly, they claimed that this book is \"offensive to anyone who isn't a born-again Christian.\" Well, I'm not. I'm Catholic, and I'm not offended. But I also have more than half a brain to think with.The authors' theology does come on a bit strong -- but really, consider the source. Both are established Christian writers. What did you think they would write about? Some sort of philosophy in which God doesn't really care about our ultimate fate? That seems to be the popular idea nowadays, but still not one everyone embraces. These authors are writing from their ideas and their life experiences, which surely are different from mine or yours. Additionally, if you are trying to compare this fictional work with the text of the Bible, this series will come up short every time -- it is FICTION for a reason! It is someone's idea of what COULD happen, not a definite foretelling of what will happen.I enjoyed this book because it is a fascinating look at what COULD happen at the end of time. How the \"Rapture\" will effect the global economy, politics, and families. How easily people can be deceived and killed with kindness. It makes the reader reflect on what he or she would do in that situation. It was a very easy read, and very entertaining. I will absolutely be reading the next in the series. My only real complaint with this book, which to me was a noticeable step down from the first book, was that about 100 or so pages were devoted to Buck's and Chloe's relationship, which was filled with bumbling dialogue and halting narration. Clearly, romance is not the authors' forte."}, {"userName": "Rissa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41794459-rissa", "userReview": "3.5\u2b50\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "Timothy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4873764-timothy", "userReview": "While slightly better written than the first book (which is like saying steer manure is slightly better smelling than cow manure), this second helping of the \"Left Behind\" series suffers even more from lack of storytelling ability and imagination. The first 1/3 - 1/2 of the book is mostly taken up with an insipid budding romance fraught with problems of mistaken identity and mixed signals that seems like it was lifted straight out of any bad sit-com you can name. And once that is finally resolved, we are treated to a scene of synchronized cookie eating that sounds like some bit of smarm from a tween romance or \"Sweet Valley High\" book. The rest of the book is about on the same par as we are treated to such clever witicisms as the old \"I'm sorry.\" \"Don't apologize!\" \"Sorry.\" and a reporter saying \"...a lie announcement. I mean live announcement\" at the appropriate time. It isn't until the last 1/4 - 1/3 of the book than anything finally happens, and even that is tepid and unimaginative. How evil can the Anti-Christ really be if all he is capable of is a couple of murders, stealing an airplane, a few Jedi mind tricks, and getting his secretary to send a woman flowers and candy in some lame attempt to get the woman's father to leave town to protect his daughter from some \"dangerous\" stalker? And how can one of the two \"witnesses\" call someone on the phone if they never leave the Wailinig Wall? Then, at the end of the book, the author's conveniently skip over an entire 18 months they, obviously, don't feel capable of coming up with enough to write about just so they can get to the part where they can start writing about the beginning of the \"Judgements\" and the main character getting married to a woman who was only mentioned once before and that we never met before he asked her to marry him.

The romance story line gets really intersting for a while, then ends up getting sappy toward the end of the book.Suspense, intrigue etc. etc. [personal complaints]:They actually moved the U.N. to a place called \"New Babylon\". I can't believe people, especially religious people (for example the Catholics, or especially the Jews that were left behind) would not see that there was something spiritually fishy about that idea, seeing how frequently the name of Babylon is used in the old testament to refer to evil.Also, Actual fire blew out of the mouths of the witnesses to devour their enemies. Again this seems a bit too literal for me and makes them seem a bit meaner than I would have expected. Also, the Jews are not only waiting for the messiah to return, which many believe has happened, but many chritians are still waiting for Elijah and Moses to return (which we believe has already happened)--but this reaction is just because of my personal beliefs.Also the Jewish scholar who does a 3 year study on prophecy of the messiah sounded exactly like a Christian Scholar. This was a slightly inspirational part of the story but it was obviously scripted by a Christian author which made it less believable.I am surprised it took 1 1/2 years from the \"rapture\" until the world started seeming like it was receiving tribulation.Still a good novel."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193580-amanda", "userReview": "After the first one, I didn't really want to chew through alot of political stuff. I liked the first book, but parts of it moved really slow for me. However, book 2 in the Left Behind series was great. While still slightly political, the action is much more fast paced. As the group of four who call themselves the Tribulation Force move closer to the signing of the treaty which will start the seven year Tribulation period, the world rejoices in the new world leader, Nicolae Carpathia. Even religious leaders are taken in by his promise of world peace, overlooking the slight manipulations that those who've given their life to God (albeit a little too late as they missed the Rapture) can see. The story moves quick and has several powerful moments. Admittedly, these will probably hit you harder if you're a Christian (but these books are good enough to be enjoyed by everyone, so don't let that deter you). The prophets at the Wailing Wall, Tsion's speech about the true Messiah, and the coming of the Red Horse of the Apocalypse are all moments in the book where I had to truly stop to take a breath. While all the books are steeped in Scripture, this one may be even more so than the first one. While \"Left Behind\" sets the stage for the rest of the series, \"Tribulation Force\" gives it momentum and the urge to jump right in to the next book. Criticisms? The romance aspect seems a little overdone and partially contrived.

But based on the recommendation of several friends, I picked up the second novel in the series and gave it a try.And while I liked Tribulation Force and it was a fairly quick read, I can't say that I was overly impressed by it.Please don't misunderstand me--the authors have done a great job of researching the end times as predicted in Revelations and creating a world in which those events are coming to pass. If they stuck to that alone, my rating for this story would be a lot higher than it is. It's just that they don't write characters very well. None of the main protagonists feels very three-dimensional and that causes me to lose interest in them from time to time. Add to it that they pause every four pages to reflect on the events that have taken place up until now and it can get tedious quickly.I will, however, give the authors one thing--they know how to end a book.

There were a few things that annoyed me though.1. Rayford and Chloe's relationship. It didn't seem believable as a father and daughter relationship. I guess they were just very open and that's great, but I didn't fully buy it. I found myself wondering if perhaps the authors (both males) were living vicariously through Rayford and wishing their relationships with their own daughters were so amazing. A lot of times I kept feeling like I was stuck in an episode of Full House (a show I love and adore) which is great and all, but like I said just not totally realistic to me especially for two people under so much stress and trauma.2. Buck and Chloe's relationship. I understand this is a Christian book so relationships won't have that level of intensity or lust, but I didn't feel like it was so realistic either. I appreciate the wholesomeness, I often rant in reviews about sex scenes in books (I don't mind them if they're relevant, but sometimes it just seems like authors just throw them in because they have nothing better to do, you know?). However, Chloe and Buck were a little too wholesome and the relationship just seemed superficial. I guess two elderly male authors who are very Christian may have had trouble conjuring up a decent romance? I just felt like the whole \"romance\" was very flat and emotionless. I didn't really FEEL THE LOVE. Same goes for Rayford and Amanda White. I just wasn't \"sold\".All in all, it was a great book. Very exciting, kept me interested the whole time. I love the message and the different character's faith is inspiring.

Why are there so many good reviews? Surely the Antichrist is to blame on both counts. I hate to leave reviews this brief and snarky, so I had to come back and elaborate. 20 years ago, when these books first came out, I was working in an office in Lexington, Ky, with a large number of evangelical type folks. They were nice guys, but given to starting arguments about evolution (it's all made up, have you heard?), singing Gospel songs at top volume in the office, and one of them once told another one that a recently deceased family member would \"burn in Hell\" if she hadn't been saved. Honestly, that last bit even shocked the other evangelical guy. Anyway, they were all reading these books and digging on them hard. I guess they thought, \"Hey, let's recommend them to that Heathen girl.\" (<--that's me, your humble narrator.) The first book was no great shakes and nothing was going to onboard me with the End Times philosophy, but it did have a certain compelling flow. I did have to get through to the end to see what happened, even as I'm still embarrassed to admit it. They loaned me the second one then, this book. At this point, I noticed a disquieting sort of joy at this upcoming tribulation business emanating from the text. Maybe I was imagining it, but it sure seems like Tim LaHaye (the half of the writing duo that provided all the Rapture intel) was positively gleeful over the shitstorm in store for all those non-believers. I did finish the book before I returned it.I don't know where exactly I'm going with this. I guess that the series is supposedly a conversion tool, but why would you want to woo people to your beliefs just by terrorizing them? Are they really going to be sincere practitioners of the faith, or just terrified that the Anti-Christ is hiding under their beds with a bunch of Ozzy Osbourne albums? (and if he is, does he have a spare copy of Bark at the Moon, because my version is really scratched up.) Also, there's the small matter that the Rapture is hardly universally accepted amongst theological scholars. In fact, almost no scholars-real ones-believe in it. I remain an Atheist, so mission not achieved. I doubt in reality many minds were swayed by these books though. The series was not only a tool, it was a serious cash cow. It spawned 16 books in this series alone. There is also a \"Children's\" series which sounds hideous. And there's a video game series where the players can either pray at or shoot non-believers. See? I was right.

What I can say is that the book continues from where the last book finished where the main Christian characters decide to form some elite commando group called the Tribulation Force to go and tell as many people the gospel of Jesus as possible. A noble idea and something that we should consider doing ourselves, except that while the gospel should be first and foremost in our lives, we should learn to balance our relationships with others so that we do not drive them away with them thinking that we are fundamentalist jerks.\tI have known people that base their relationships purely on their success of sharing the gospel with others. A friend of mine once said that he met somebody in his university course whom he became friends with however as soon as this person discovered he was a Christian, she no longer wanted to have anything to do with him, and this person was a Christian. Others make friends and immediately launch into a gospel presentation, and when that person rejects the presentation, they simply dump that person and move on to a new person. I can understand some of the reasoning of the second person (though not the first) however I have always preferred to develop the friendship alongside my love of Christ so that while they know that I am a Christian, they can also see my Christianity in action and respond appropriately. I have had rabidly anti-Christians come to me and tell me that I am one of the best Christians that they have known, and with that, I feel that my role in their understanding of the gospel has been successful. Remember, sharing our faith does not come down to runs on the board, but rather our living relationships with others, both Christian and non-Christian.\tNow, I will speak about the idea of pre-millennialism. This is the theory that there is a period in the future (usually the near future) in which all Christians will be taken from the Earth (the rapture) which will herald in a period known as the last days, or the Tribulation. During this period things will go from bad to very bad, namely because the moderating force of Christianity is no longer present. This period usually lasts for seven years, at which time Christ will return and rule for 1000 years. At the end of that thousand years the final battle between God and Satan will be fought with God being the ultimate victor. \tI used to subscribe to this idea, but not any more as I feel that there are a number of problems with this theology. First of all, where do all the bad people go for the millenium? They suggest that they are still present, only they are under the authority of God no matter how much they hate it. The second is that there is a focus on the rapture that could happen at any time, so we need to be prepared. Graeme Goldsworthy supports my view on this in that whatever the idea of the rapture, we must remember that we could die at anytime, and the fact that I could walk out onto High Street and get hit by a bus sort of makes the idea of the rapture a moot point. Yes, the rapture could occur, but then so could my cold blooded murder. I think we need to be aware of the fact that we all die more than the belief that all Christians could suddenly vanish. If that is the case, at least we get a second chance. There is no second chance where death is involved.\tAnother problem is Jesus' warnings about calculating times and dates. He specifically says that we should avoid trying to pinpoint a time when he is coming. As he says, he will come like a thief in the night, suddenly and unexpected, and that we should actually avoid those people that try to tell us when he is coming, or even pointing to events and saying that these events say that he is coming soon. Of course he is coming soon, he told us that when he was on Earth, and he has been coming soon for the last two thousand years. Time to God is not time to us. God is patient, and to God a thousand years is a day and a day is a thousand years. We should be aware, just like death, Jesus could come at anytime, and there is no actual event that will signal this, beyond his death and resurrection.\tIt is also interesting that in one of the epistles (I cannot remember which one) we are warned against focusing on times and dates as it is distracting. It seems that even as far back as the early church people were caught up with times and dates, whether it be when he would return, or the exact age of the church, or whether God created the world in a literal or figurative seven days. We are told that this is not only irrelevant, it is also very distracting. It takes us away from the centrality of Christ's death and resurrection, and gets us caught up in fringe arguments that have nothing to do with our salvation."}, {"userName": "Darrell Marshall", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51960244-darrell-marshall", "userReview": "If the whole series of the \"Left Behind\" books were not based on a very deceptive teaching that was NEVER taught in the early Church, and in fact, originated less than 200 years ago, I may have given them 3 or 4 stars, because they are not that bad as works of fiction.But because Tim LaHaye teaches in supplementary books and group study workbooks, that the \"Pre-Tribulation Rapture\" is Biblical Doctrine, his multi-million dollar bestselling series is no longer just a \"Christian Fiction Thiller\", it is dangerously deceiving millions of people as well.This \"Pre-Trib Rapture\" teaching began as anti-Reformation propaganda created by a Jesuit Priest, but was rejected as false doctrine by the Protestant Church up until around 1830, when it was reintroduced as a \"new revelation\" from God and erroneously \"supported\" by Scriptures that were then, and continue til this day, to have been completely and repeatedly taken out of context, and during the mid to late 19th century, became \"doctrine\" within some denominations after being adopted and spread throughout the United States by D.L. Moody in his Prophecy Conferences, John Darby in his commentaries, and probably the most significant contributor to its widespread popularity, C.I. Scofield in his \"Scofield Study Bible\" which is still in print today.The \"Pre-Trib Rapture\" teaching later had a resurgence in the late 1960's and early 1970's with devotees and self-proclaimed \"prophecy experts\" like Hal Lindsey (\"The Late Great Planet Earth\"), Jack Van Impe, and Tim LaHaye, amongst numerous others, who have all made millions of dollars peddling this erroneous teaching through books, TV shows, and movies."}, {"userName": "Boundless", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56656165-boundless", "userReview": "DNF - I read the first book as a kid, so obviously when relationship drama happened in the second book, I got bored and stopped.

Only the people that truly love God will understand what is happening on Earth."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "I don't have a problem with these books, i don't know if the Book of Revelatuion will be worked out as literaly as these stories picture it. They require as a necessity of their telling a certain amount of interprition, for example, who the \"Beast\" will be, where he will arise and so on. I am a Christian and believe that the Book of Revelution is in the Bible for a reason, Like I said, i'm just not sure of some of the literalness here. they could very well be right, but I I'll wait and see.The real reason I give only 2 stars here is for poor story telling. I just don't think the books are quite that good. here we follow the \"left behind\" who have turned to Christ after the Rapture as they watch the tribulation being set up.The characters continue their lives and they lose their first member as WWIII starts."}, {"userName": "Alexander Draganov", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3826049-alexander-draganov", "userReview": "Massive improvement over book one.

This spark quickly expired and I am confident in saying I will not be reading any materials from LaHaye and Jenkins again. I read this book shortly after completing Left Behind. I found Left Behind to be somewhat entertaining and thought, well, let's give the rest of the series a go. About half way through Tribulation Force I regretted this decision and cursed my inability to put abandon a book once I've started it.The storyline between the characters in this series is painfully dull and reeks of those \"after-school-dramas\". Honestly, if the authors stuck to their take on the actual Rapture, they'd have a winning story. But they haven't and I can't take anymore."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18427573-rachel", "userReview": "This was my first re-read of the stores since they first came out, just before 9/11. Jenkins and LaHaye are strong writers, and back up their fiction with scriptural prophecies. I did find myself wishing the characters would just get on with things... (ahem, Chlo\u00e9!) when entire chapters were created from simple misunderstandings. but alas, that's what sells fiction, right? these books challenge me to take end times more seriously and to redouble my efforts to warn my loved ones about their future without Christ."}, {"userName": "Tyler Sellers", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37791342-tyler-sellers", "userReview": "The \"Tribulation Force\" was an amazing book filled with suspense, romance, drama, and action. I love how it actually matches up to scripture when it talks about prophecies and the events happening during the Tribulation. The authors did a great job of portraying the characters to what I believe was spot on to how they would have acted in the end times. Even though its just a science fiction book, it still moved me at points and I can say that it is the best christian book I've read let alone maybe even the best book I've read."}, {"userName": "Talia Colley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8228269-talia-colley", "userReview": "[ Bruce's death at the end of the book was so sad, but I'm sure it's just the first of many terrible events to come.
