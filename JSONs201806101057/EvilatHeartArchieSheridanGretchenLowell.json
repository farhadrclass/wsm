This is book Three in the Archie Sheridan and Gretchen Lowell Series. This is a very fantastic dark series. It is definitely not for the faint of heart since there is a lot of torture going on. I was up till 2am reading this book and when I fell asleep I actually had a nightmare. I recommend that you read these in order.Archie Sheridan was held captive and tortured by Gretchen Lowell, a beautiful and sexy serial killer who has haunted the citizens of Portland, OR for years. She brags that she\u2019s killed over 200 people, and she nearly killed Archie. He\u2019s voluntarily admitted himself into a psychiatric hospital in an attempt to get over his addiction of Vicoden, and Gretchen herself.Archie\u2019s not the only one who is infatuated with Gretchen. Her crimes have been sensationalized by the media; Hundreds of \u201cBeauty Killer\u201d fan sites have popped up on the internet. There\u2019s even a tour bus that drives tourists around to the spots where Gretchen\u2019s victims\u2019 bodies were found.When body parts are discovered in the bathroom of a local rest stop, along with the tell-tale \u201chearts\u201d Gretchen was known to decorate her crime scenes (and victims!) with, everyone believes the serial killer is killing again. Archie\u2019s good friend, Detective Henry Sobol, new lead of the \u201cBeauty Killer\u201d task force, asks Archie to check himself out of the psych ward to once again join the hunt for Gretchen. Joining the hunt alongside Archie and Henry is Susan Ward, a reporter for the local newspaper, another near-victim of the Beauty Killer.Bodies begin showing up at the sites of Gretchen\u2019s killings. Something seems a little off to Archie. Gretchen\u2019s MO is to remove the spleens of her victims and to carve hearts on their bodies. These new victims don\u2019t quite fit the profile of Gretchen\u2019s handiwork. Once again, Archie puts his own life in danger in order to find the truth behind the killings.Chelsea Cain has once again done a stunning job! Her ability to portray such a vicious killer astounds and impresses me. As in the previous two books, Sweetheart and Heartsick, the relationship between Archie and Gretchen fascinates me! Archie\u2019s character has performed an astounding transformation. He literally went from a bumbling love-sick puppy in Gretchen\u2019s presence to a relatively strong character.There are quite a few scenes in Evil at Heart that are terrifying and gruesome, even more so than any of Cain\u2019s previous books. However, this wasn\u2019t just randomly inserted, I think it was done to realistically capture the pure evil that resides in the killer.I highly recommend this, and the other \u201cBeauty Killer\u201d books to anyone who enjoy a nice, terrifying read! Read it I dare you! Gretchen is just pure evil. I can't wait to read the fourth book and I am hoping I will be able to fit it in at the end of this month."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32799998-erin", "userReview": "4.5 StarsEvil At Heart may be the scariest book in the series in my humble opinion, because it's not about one deranged and charismatic serial killer. It's about a group(cult) of people who are obsessed with said serial killer and who maybe either helping her kill or committing copycat killings. I love True crime but I've never understood people who write letters to killers in prison or who want to own things that killers owned or created. I can understand why a person becomes a serial killer but serial killer groupies baffle me. Evil At Heart picks up roughly 2 months after the events of Sweetheart and we find our hero? Archie Sheridan drug-free but still struggling. I deduced 1/2 a star because there wasn't enough Gretchen Lowell and I found the bad guy to be a little boring. Chelsea Cain continues to write with savage grace and at this point I would read anything she writes. I tried to put this book down and read something else but this story would not let me. In the last 2 days I have finished the first3books in this series and as I write this review book 4 is sitting right next to me. If you've read my reviews for Heartsick and Sweetheart than you know that these books are not for everyone but if you loved those books than you will love this one as well.Summer Reading Challenge: Read A Book That Scares The Beejesus Out Of You."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1876672-emily", "userReview": "FINALLY Archie Sheridan gets his balls back. That should really be the subtitle to this book. Evil At Heart: Archie Sheridan Finds His Balls. And it seriously can't come sooner enough after the self induced torture fest that was Sweetheart. Jesus H, I've never wanted to punch a main character in the face more then I did through that entire novel. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER REVIEW ENTIRELY. Moving on. I absolutely loved this. We see the (somehow, didn't think it was even possible to go further) darker side of Gretchen Lowell and the consequences of being a crazy messed up beautiful serial killer that abducts children and tortures them. There's a lot of mind games in this one between Archie and Gretchen but not in the annoying WHY CAN'T YOU JUST SHOOT HER IN THE FACE way that was basically all of Sweetheart. A lot of twists where you're not sure if Gretchen is telling the truth, then you're not sure if NOW she's telling the truth, and it all gets seriously F'd up in the end but it's AWESOME. Susan is back being bad ass and hilarious as usual, and Archie, once again, finally chokes the bejesus out of Gretchen. A couple of times. It's the most fulfilled I've felt after reading a book in awhile. The book also takes time to delve into the consequences of a media saturated culture, and how a serial killer can be glorified by the media to become an unintended role model to the public eye. Especially a beautiful one. I thought it was a great take on societal interest in murder and and our cultural obsession with beauty and power but it was subtle enough to not be preachy or overbearing. In Susan's voice it was absolutely perfect. Thankfully, the relationship between Archie and Gretchen isn't nearly as irritating this time around as it's mostly about Archie getting his shit together and releasing the hold Gretchen has on his massively damaged psyche. It's most fulfilling. Now if Archie and Susan would just get together, this would top my list as one of the best mystery series of all time. Regardless, it's still up there for sure."}, {"userName": "Angela DeSilva ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29037227-angela-desilva", "userReview": "Binge reading this series."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin", "userReview": "While Heartsick was a nifty twist on the serial killer novel and Sweetheart was a good if predictable follow-up, the third installment of the Grechen Lowell series loses the excitement. Evil at Heart misses on many levels. Gretchen Lowell barely shows up, Archie Sheridan descends from tragic to pathetic and the author seems to be wingin' it through 80% of this novel. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the book is the author's choice to make an indictment of our society's habit of glorifying murderers. While there may be an argument to be made here, I do not think it should come from a writer whose bestseller status rides on the exploits of a sexy charismatic serial killer. I think the Gretchen Lowell series is officially running on fumes. I hear there is a fourth book but count me out."}, {"userName": "Janet ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19512233-janet", "userReview": "Another fast paced read in the series.

Part of me feared this series would become strained and repetitive, but three books in I\u2019m of the firm belief this series is going to continue growing stronger and will keep us on our toes.Honestly, I was amazed by the tale in this one. The usual undertones are felt throughout this story \u2013 everything we have come to love about the Archie Sheridan and Gretchen Lowell dynamic in the first two books \u2013 yet the story has a slightly different feel to it. It was a refreshing addition to the series, a way of guaranteeing fans will continue to return.I was hooked with this series already. Book one gave me the dark and twisted villain I had been hoping to receive. Book two gave me the damaged lead and twisted emotions I had hoped for in regards to our main character, the damage continuing to develop. Book three gave me both of those things, along with an addictive storyline that works perfectly fine as an individual tale whilst also adding a lot to the overall series.I feel as though this book holds a number of secrets that will become more important in the later books. There were details I found truly interesting, and yet I cannot help but hope they will prove to be truly powerful elements in the later books.Without a doubt, I think this is my favourite in the series thus far. There is such promise of where the future books will take us, and I cannot wait to dive into more of this series."}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun", "userReview": "3.5 This was a bit of a disappointment compared to the first two books in the series. The plot is too convoluted and too over-the-top with its many implausible twists. Sure this is fiction and I'm willing to \"play along,\" at least most of the time, but the story-line was bordering on contrived and overtly so. The great characters are also on the verge of becoming caricaturesThat said, I've still opted to bump this up to four stars because I think, despite its flaws, Cain manages to do some really important things in this book as it relates to the series and the ongoing drama that is Archie Sheridan's life. However, if book 4 fails to deliver...well, I might just have to move on.Had this been the second book in the series, I might have passed on book 3 (yeah...I know), but as it is I am invested enough in the characters to forgive this book its shortcomings and continue with book 4.I still think this would make a great HBO series as the cast of characters is so strong and I can't see how it could be anything but a success."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15055195-gary", "userReview": "The 3rd book in the Archie Sheridan and Gretchen Lowell series by author Chelsea Cain. I had previously read the first 2 books in the series and enjoyed them but to be honest I found this one less entertaining. Maybe the story has worn thin or maybe it was simply that the main character featured a lot less in this novel. This series needs to be read in order to fully appreciate and I am willing to give this series another chance with the 4th book."}, {"userName": "Katie(babs)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/179852-katie-babs", "userReview": "Evil at Heart is the third book by Chelsea Cain that showcases the barely forty year old homicide detective Archie Sheridan who fell victim to serial killer Gretchen Lowell. For two years Gretchen has been Archie\u2019s everything. She has been in his thoughts, much like a drug that he craves everyday even though he knows if he has her, she will be the death of him. She almost killed him once, by holding him captive for ten days and torturing him in the worst ways imaginable to the human mind. Archie lived through it and has been trying to get his life on track. In Heartsick we were given a small piece on why Archie was so obsessed with Gretchen and she with him. In Sweetheart we saw Archie brought down by this sick and evil woman because of his own stupidity. I won\u2019t go in great detail why my opinion of Archie changed after reading Sweetheart, because it\u2019s a big spoiler, but let\u2019s just say his physical and emotional suffering and guilt is enough for the wrongs he felt he has done against his wife, family and co-workers.At the end of Sweetheart, Gretchen, who is known as the Beauty Killer, escaped from prison and lead Archie on a merry chase. She is now on the loose because of a pact Archie made with her. As long as he doesn\u2019t kill himself, she won\u2019t kill any other people. Now two months later Archie is in a mental hospital recovering and Gretchen has become a media superstar. She is a celebrity idol whose face is on billboards and countless magazine covers. There is even a bus tour that takes tourists to the various places where she killed. Even with all this exposure, you would think someone would spot her. But Gretchen is an untraceable phantom. Suddenly, bodies start piling up and are found in very sickening ways. Is this Gretchen at play again or perhaps a copycat? A copycat could be a good possibility because Gretchen has a fan club and many of her fans want to be just like her.Archie\u2019s former partner Henry Sobol is called on this case and Susan Ward, reporter for the Herald, who thinks of Archie as a friend and has seen Gretchen\u2019s work up close thinks there are more to the killings than meets the eye. And because Archie is the only one who knows about Gretchen and her crimes in everyway possible, Henry asks him to help with the case. Archie doesn\u2019t think Gretchen is the one doing the killings and he rather stay at the hospital drifting away where he has no responsibilities. Gretchen wants Archie back into the game and because she is a master manipulator, she is able to get to him even though he is under lock and key. He has no choice but to join the investigation in a different way where the rules no longer apply to him. He doesn\u2019t care if he \u2018s putting himself in harm\u2019s way because he know Gretchen won\u2019t allow anyone to hurt him unless she can be the one holding the knife against his throat herself.Chelsea Cain has written another suspenseful and riveting thriller with many twists and turns. Evil at Heart is a bit more gruesome than her last two novels because the way the victims are killed are told in great detail. This time Archie is a bit more pathetic. He has lost everything, from his wife to his job, as well as the person he thought he was. He comes across a bit too weak and stupid. I used to hold Archie in high regard even though he was obsessed with Gretchen. But because the dynamics of their relationship changed in Heartsick, I lost a bit of respect for him. I actually feel pity for this man and I am at the point where I\u2019ve begun to question why Gretchen is obsessed with Archie as he is with her. Gretchen likes to prey on weak men. Archie seems very weak and I believe he didn\u2019t he may have been this way from the start.Gretchen is always an interesting character to read. She is a very masterful character who brings forth a great deal of confusion. Gretchen\u2019s \u201cscreen time\u201d is very slim. Just by the characters and public keeping her first and foremost, she comes alive. This is so very surprising because even though Grechen doesn\u2019t make many appearances, she is the most important part of Evil at Heart.The final showdown, yet again between Archie and Gretchen, will have you a scratching your head. What Archie goes through to find Gretchen or the killer responsible for the copy cat Beauty Killings gets a bit ridiculous. How much more suffering is Archie going to go through for the sins of his past? I\u2019m surprised he wasn\u2019t in a vegetative coma by the amount of abuse his body goes through. Gretchen always comes out smelling like roses. Everything rolls off her back and we still don\u2019t know her motivation for things and why she has such strong feelings for Archie. What is about Archie that makes him stand out from all the rest of her victims? I think it\u2019s about time Chelsea gives us some insight on what makes Gretchen tick.Overall, Evil at Heart is a fast read that many readers will enjoy. Things are left in such a way that things are not over between Archie and Gretchen and I do believe Chelsea has a few more tricks up her sleeves. These tricks may come as a surprise because she may have a new centralized story where Archie and Gretchen may finally become supporting characters instead of being the main ones.I know if Chelsea were to write another book, with or without Archie and Gretchen, I will be there to read it."}, {"userName": "Titas (I read in bed)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33262643-titas-i-read-in-bed", "userReview": "It has been 2 months since Gretchen disappeared after promising Archie that she won't kill any more. Archie is still in a mental patients' home to recover from his last encounter with Gretchen. The media is going crazier day by day with a serial killer loose again. And if this was not enough of a pandemonium, the killing starts again. The same spots of Gretchen's murders are again being decorated with bodies in a similar manner. Did Gretchen start again?I am now disappointed with the series. The book surely is thrilling, gripping and full of adrenaline rush like the previous two but the problem is that there is no character development. Archie is still obsessed with Gretchen, Henry is failing at saving Archie and Susan is being a pain in the back like she is supposed to be(complete circle). For me characterization is very important and if they are in a series of a continuous storyline (unlike separate stories with same characters) then there must be some significant character developments.I am borrowing a line from the movie The Dark Knight to describe Archie. He is like a dog chasing a car. He runs and runs but doesn't know what to do if he ever catches it. Archie wants to capture Gretchen, he wants to see her, hunt her, arrest her. But when she actually is in front of him, he is like dumbstruck puppy with a gun almost every time. Doesn't Henry already know that Archie and Susan don't listen to him? Every time he tells them something, they do completely the opposite like a bunch of irritating teenagers. Then why does he never make sure about that? In a same book, they disobeys him again and again but he still trusts their words?And last but not the least, there is still nothing about Gretchen's past. Why does she kill? Why had she started? Who is she? The book answers none.Although the book has its thrill, suspense and rush, now the series feels really repetitive and lacks the magic of the fist two books.

Instead, the parodic moments are for the most part folded neatly into a running sub-theme about the cultural fascination with serial killers like Gretchen, a theme that takes a dark turn when some of her fans start to identify a little too deeply...Although it occasionally starts to feel like the train is in danger of losing its momentum, Chelsea Cain still has some secrets left to reveal in Archie and Gretchen's backstory, and enough new curveballs to make it pretty obvious that we could be looking at a fourth novel in this series, to say the least.

Evil at Heart follows Heartsick and Sweetheart and we pick up a couple of months after the conclusion of Sweetheart. This review will have **Spoilers** for Sweetheart because it\u2019s almost impossible to talk about Evil at Heart without referencing what happened at the conclusion of the last book.So when we open, Archie has checked himself into a mental facility voluntarily after failing to apprehend Gretchen when she escaped in the second book and also because of the sort of relationship they had while they were together when she was on the run. At the moment they\u2019re at a kind of stale mate \u2013 Gretchen is promising not to kill anyone else as long as Archie doesn\u2019t kill himself. It\u2019s a tenuous thread but it seems to be holding \u2013 until bodies start turning up in previous dump sites of Beauty Killer victims. Everyone is sure it\u2019s Gretchen starting her murderous spree again but Archie isn\u2019t so sure. The Beauty Killer doesn\u2019t repeat things and this is all looking like the work of a copycat killer. Gretchen has been sensationalised by the media \u2013 she\u2019s on every magazine cover going around, she\u2019s on billboards, there are books and TV specials about her, there\u2019s a movie being made. She\u2019s been turned into a figure that\u2019s almost sympathetic, that is worshiped and admired by the wider community, her brutality a dim memory to anyone who didn\u2019t experience it firsthand. She remains still at large although there are reported sightings of her all over the world, including in two continents at the same time. While Archie tries to remain hidden away in his psychiatric facility, trying to come off his addiction to prescription drugs, he is forced to accept the fact that Gretchen can reach him anywhere \u2013 even in here. He is forced to leave the facility after one of her \u2018apprentices\u2019 murders a resident that Archie was nice too, aware that he is putting people in danger. He\u2019s also back unofficially on the case, trying to track down the Gretchen worshipers and find out just who exactly is committing these murders.Sniffing around is Susan Ward the journalist from the first two novels who wants to write a book on Gretchen and how the media has elevated her. She wants Archie involved and members of the public are involving her sending her into an abandoned house to discover a body \u2013 the latest victim of the copycat Beauty Killer. As Archie and Susan end up together again searching the seedier areas of Portland for the Gretchen fans, they are once again in danger but this time not just from Gretchen \u2013 from her busy fans as well. And then there\u2019s Gretchen herself, wandering in and out of houses as she pleases to chat to Archie before taking off again. The one good thing that\u2019s come out of this is that Archie\u2019s feelings for Gretchen have changed. He\u2019s going to be stronger this time\u2026.I enjoy these sorts of novels, I do. But I\u2019m also by nature, cynical and mocking and it does make me laugh how unbelievably stupid the main characters often are. Obviously in these types of novels, there are certain people that are never going to be murdered no matter how stupid they act and how evil/insane/murderous their opponents are. Clearly Archie and Susan are two of these people \u2013 Gretchen has had him twice now and tortured him beyond belief and he\u2019s still alive. And unforunately, so is Susan, popping up in every other scene discovering bodies, asking annoying questions and investigating armed only with a can of Mace, her ridiculously coloured hair and her annoying personality. If I were Gretchen it\u2019s quite likely I\u2019d kill her just to stop her talking and just being everywhere at every possible time. In the first novel I thought she was a little bit of a quirk, just an additive to the main storyline but now it\u2019s becoming obvious that she\u2019s half running the show and she\u2019s going to be all there, all the time. I wish I liked her more, I do but I\u2019m afraid that I really don\u2019t. I wish that just for once, she\u2019d go and sit in her car and lock the doors and do what the police tell her to instead of being all \u201cI\u2019m coming with you!\u201d. She\u2019s a journalist. I\u2019m not sure how often journalists apprehend serial killers, or help discover bodies but I\u2019m not thinking it\u2019s all that often. And if they do then probably they\u2019re candidates for Archie\u2019s psychicatric ward. But Susan just keeps bouncing back like she never nearly got killed 39 times. It\u2019s mind-boggling. I\u2019m not entirely sure why she\u2019s there as she doesn\u2019t really ever provide much to the storyline. She\u2019s just\u2026there.I\u2019d probably like these books a whole lot more if she wasn\u2019t in them. I can take Archie discovering bodies and going looking for Gretchen because he\u2019s a detective and actually ran the Beauty Killer task force before. It\u2019s sort of amazing he\u2019s still functioning after what has been done to him too and although he\u2019s gone through some utterly deplorable stages, I think he\u2019s starting to come out the other side now. His relationship with Gretchen in Sweetheart was pretty hard to stomach, especially towards the end. Although this novel has its gory bits, it seemed less confronting than previous novels. It\u2019s more focused on how the media made Gretchen into a celebrity, how people came to admire her rather than fear and abhor her \u2013 how the media ran Gretchen story after Gretchen story long after there was anything new left to write. And it\u2019s happened \u2013 perhaps not to this extent, but certainly tragedy, death and destruction sell newspapers and magazines and tune people in to the TV. And it\u2019s not like serial killers haven\u2019t inspired people in real life, or taken on apprentices as Gretchen does. Males who are willing to do anything for her, even kill or commit suicide.What I wish was more explored, was Gretchen\u2019s charisma. We\u2019re told a lot that she\u2019s just that compelling \u2013 Archie has an affair with her both before he realises that she is the Beauty Killer, and also after and there are several men who are discovered as being accomplices. She\u2019s able to move around Portland relatively easily, despite all the aforementioned magazine covers/billboards/etc and no one spots her. She walks in and out of a police officer\u2019s house while there is a uniformed car and cop out the front. It\u2019s very easy to create this amazingly intellectual and charismatic killer but I need to be shown more. She\u2019s tortured and killed about 200 people in the conservative estimate, but we learn very little about how she managed to do it.Despite my cynicism coming out, the books really are quite gripping. There is something about the pacing that really sucks you in and spits you out at the end leaving you a bit horrified and disgusted but sort of enthralled. The nitpicks I have wouldn\u2019t be an issue for many people who enjoy crime novels and the little suspension of disbelief that you have to do in order to read and love them. I like them but I can never quite stop snorting with laughter at them. I have enjoyed this series a little more than some others and I\u2019ll keep reading it \u2013 a 4th novel has already been written and I kind of hope we\u2019re getting away from Gretchen now. Surely her story arc is done \u2013 she\u2019s killed, been captured, escaped, escaped again, etc. With a bit of luck she\u2019s mostly gone now and Archie can start putting the pieces of his shattered life back together and get back to being a fully functioning human being (well as much as someone can be after being kidnapped, tortured, etc by a psychopath) and solving crimes."}, {"userName": "Bev Taylor", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5162540-bev-taylor", "userReview": "serial killer gretchen lowell is on the run. she has a cult following and near superstar media coverage but to detective archie sheridan, whom she nearly killed and then saved, she will always be his nemesis he has spent the last few months of his life on a psychiatric ward but now she has resurfaced with her signature at the killing - red hearts and eyeballs taken from the slots of her victims soon he is back on the trail with journalist susan ward and another detective, harry. but r these her works or those of a copy cat who is out to get recognition from their hero? whatever the answer, they r determined that archie will never find out - or live to tell the tale a fast moving novel wonderfully crafted and with great characterisation there was obviously a prequel and must be a sequel as there r many unanswered questions. these i will not detail as they will give too much away ! suffice to say that u can read this as a standalone bev"}, {"userName": "Katie(babs)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/179852-katie-babs", "userReview": "Evil at Heart is the third book by Chelsea Cain that showcases the barely forty year old homicide detective Archie Sheridan who fell victim to serial killer Gretchen Lowell. For two years Gretchen has been Archie\u2019s everything. She has been in his thoughts, much like a drug that he craves everyday even though he knows if he has her, she will be the death of him. She almost killed him once, by holding him captive for ten days and torturing him in the worst ways imaginable to the human mind. Archie lived through it and has been trying to get his life on track. In Heartsick we were given a small piece on why Archie was so obsessed with Gretchen and she with him. In Sweetheart we saw Archie brought down by this sick and evil woman because of his own stupidity. I won\u2019t go in great detail why my opinion of Archie changed after reading Sweetheart, because it\u2019s a big spoiler, but let\u2019s just say his physical and emotional suffering and guilt is enough for the wrongs he felt he has done against his wife, family and co-workers.At the end of Sweetheart, Gretchen, who is known as the Beauty Killer, escaped from prison and lead Archie on a merry chase. She is now on the loose because of a pact Archie made with her. As long as he doesn\u2019t kill himself, she won\u2019t kill any other people. Now two months later Archie is in a mental hospital recovering and Gretchen has become a media superstar. She is a celebrity idol whose face is on billboards and countless magazine covers. There is even a bus tour that takes tourists to the various places where she killed. Even with all this exposure, you would think someone would spot her. But Gretchen is an untraceable phantom. Suddenly, bodies start piling up and are found in very sickening ways. Is this Gretchen at play again or perhaps a copycat? A copycat could be a good possibility because Gretchen has a fan club and many of her fans want to be just like her..Archie\u2019s former partner Henry Sobol is called on this case and Susan Ward, reporter for the Herald, who thinks of Archie as a friend and has seen Gretchen\u2019s work up close thinks there are more to the killings than meets the eye. And because Archie is the only one who knows about Gretchen and her crimes in everyway possible, Henry asks him to help with the case. Archie doesn\u2019t think Gretchen is the one doing the killings and he rather stay at the hospital drifting away where he has no responsibilities.Gretchen wants Archie back into the game and because she is a master manipulator, she is able to get to him even though he is under lock and key. He has no choice but to join the investigation in a different way where the rules no longer apply to him. He doesn\u2019t care if he \u2018s putting himself in harm\u2019s way because he know Gretchen won\u2019t allow anyone to hurt him unless she can be the one holding the knife against his throat herself.Chelsea Cain has written another suspenseful and riveting thriller with many twists and turns. Evil at Heart is a bit more gruesome than her last two novels because the way the victims are killed are told in great detail. This time Archie is a bit more pathetic. He has lost everything, from his wife to his job, as well as the person he thought he was. He comes across a bit too weak and stupid. I used to hold Archie in high regard even though he was obsessed with Gretchen. But because the dynamics of their relationship changed in Heartsick, I lost a bit of respect for him. I actually feel pity for this man and I am at the point where I\u2019ve begun to question why Gretchen is obsessed with Archie as he is with her. Gretchen likes to prey on weak men. Archie seems very weak and I believe he didn\u2019t he may have been this way from the start.Gretchen is always an interesting character to read. She is a very masterful character who brings forth a great deal of confusion. Gretchen\u2019s \u201cscreen time\u201d is very slim. Just by the characters and public keeping her first and foremost, she comes alive. This is so very surprising because even though Grechen doesn\u2019t make many appearances, she is the most important part of Evil at Heart.The final showdown, yet again between Archie and Gretchen, will have you a scratching your head. What Archie goes through to find Gretchen or the killer responsible for the copy cat Beauty Killings gets a bit ridiculous. How much more suffering is Archie going to go through for the sins of his past? I\u2019m surprised he wasn\u2019t in a vegetative coma by the amount of abuse his body goes through. Gretchen always comes out smelling like roses. Everything rolls off her back and we still don\u2019t know her motivation for things and why she has such strong feelings for Archie. What is about Archie that makes him stand out from all the rest of her victims? I think it\u2019s about time Chelsea gives us some insight on what makes Gretchen tick.Overall, Evil at Heart is a fast read that many readers will enjoy. Things are left in such a way that things are not over between Archie and Gretchen and I do believe Chelsea has a few more tricks up her sleeves. These tricks may come as a surprise because she may have a new centralized story where Archie and Gretchen may finally become supporting characters instead of being the main ones.I know if Chelsea were to write another book, with or without Archie and Gretchen, I will be there to read it."}, {"userName": "Jodi Kauble", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11672296-jodi-kauble", "userReview": "3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Sebastian", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10589966-sebastian", "userReview": "Fans of Chelsea Cain\u2019s police detective Archie Sheridan have already been forced to suffer through a lot in the first two books of her gripping Gretchen Lowell series: he almost died twice, became heavily addicted to pain killers and destroyed his marriage because of his obsession with the woman who put him through all this misery. So on the one hand it\u2019s almost a relief to see Archie trying to finally leave his past with Gretchen behind in the third book \u201eEvil at Heart\u201c, even though this means he had to check himself into a mental institution. But on the other hand, seeing Archie in what feels like a prison cell together with an insane roommate and vegging out all day in the asylum is in some ways even worse since it shows how much his nemesis, serial killer Gretchen Lowell, has wrecked him.The Gretchen mania is everywhereWhile Archie spent week over week participating in self-help groups and trying to get Gretchen off his mind, the outside world did the complete opposite and all over America a real \u201eBeauty Killer\u201c mania broke out with special reports round the clock, Gretchen merchandise on every corner and even fan clubs that are crazy for the attractive serial killer on the loose. I was a bit surprised that after playing such a big role in the second book \u201eSweetheart\u201c there were now only a few scenes in which Gretchen Lowell actually made an appearance but nonetheless she was still EVERYWHERE: she was in everyone\u2019s thoughts, on every magazine cover and on every tv channel with such absurd shows like \u201eAmericas Sexiest Serial Killers\u201c. So to me it felt a bit as if \u201eEvil at heart\u201c wasn\u2019t exactly a story about Gretchen Lowell herself but rather about society and its reaction to her crimes. Now you might complain about not getting that many Gretchen scenes as you might have hoped for but I found the state of society that Chelsea Cain described in her novel extremely interesting and also very disturbing because I can totally imagine that such a hype about a serial killer would be possible these days. I often caught myself thinking something like \u201eWhere can I get one of those ,Run, Gretchen\u2019 t-shirts\u201c or \u201eI would definitely join one of those Beauty Killer bus trips and visit the places of her murders\u201c and found it pretty scary that the sensationalist side of this book and the Gretchen Lowell case had such an appeal to me, too. So if it was Chelsea Cain\u2019s intention to hold a mirror up to society then she definitely succeeded in my opinion and this somehow made me feel very uncomfortable.A very gripping and extremely disturbing thrillerTalking about the sensationalist aspect of this story let me just say the following: if you\u2019re rather sensitive when it comes to very graphic descriptions of violence then DON\u2019T READ THIS BOOK. I have read hundreds of thrillers in my life but Chelsea Cain still provides some of the most shocking murders I\u2019ve ever encountered in fiction and some parts really made me worry about the author\u2019s sanity since she let her characters do things to other people that I couldn\u2019t even imagine \u2013 and trust me, my evil mind can imagine A LOT ;). I think it\u2019s safe to say that Gretchen Lowell is probably the most terrifying killer I\u2019ve ever met in a thriller or crime novel and that\u2019s not only because she has killed more than 200 people in her criminal career but also because of HOW she killed them. Yes, the story takes a lot of its wicked fascination from the cruel murders but that doesn\u2019t mean that the plot itself isn\u2019t intriguing \u2013 which it definitely is. Once again the pace is very high and there\u2019s hardly a single chapter without a WTF moment or an evil cliffhanger and I became so obsessed with the story that I found it impossible to put this book down. In my opinion Gretchen Lowell and Archie Sheridan are among the most fascinating characters in this genre and I couldn\u2019t believe what both of them were capable of \u2013 I mean I already knew that Gretchen was insane but even Archie did some things that I found VERY disturbing just to get this case that has ruined his life closed. I have to admit that I\u2019m not 100% happy with how Chelsea Cain ended this book because I felt like the showdown lacked a bit of the consequence that I had expected from a series like this but overall \u201eEvil at Heart\u201c was a hell of a ride and easily became my favorite book in this series so far."}, {"userName": "Carmaletta Hilton", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/950738-carmaletta-hilton", "userReview": "Hannibal Lecter is known as the best part of Silence of the Lambs, and yet he was only in about 20 minutes of the movie, if that. Chelsea Cain seems to be taking the comparisons of Lecter and her character, Gretchen Lowell, kind of seriously, because Gretchen is the best part of this series, and she was very rarely actually in this book.Taking the comparison further, the more I read, the more Archie reminds me of a cross between Will Graham in Red Dragon and Clarice in Silence of the Lambs. (Be aware, I'm talking about the movie, as I haven't read either book yet) The tease of Gretchen killing again was nicely done, however, the teasing aspect only lasted a small time before it became very clear that she was not killing again. Once that hit, I was kind of reluctant to go on, but because it was moving so quickly and there was the chance of Gretchen later, I kept going. Some of it was worth it, some was not.The best thing about this series is the relationship, the connection, between Gretchen and Archie. The idea of a female serial killer, a BRUTAL female serial killer when such a thing is so rare, is what first attracted me to these books. Archie's obsession with Gretchen and the way it ruined his life pulled me in. Archie and Gretchen were the reason I continued to read even though the story was so overrun with a character that I can't stand.I hate Susan. I get this idea that we're supposed to like her, we're supposed to want her and Archie to hook up, but I just don't like her. She's selfish and she's annoying and she's the perfect example of what's wrong with journalism. Even her little speech in Ian's office means very little. Why? Because she STILL wrote the article, further cashing in on Gretchen Lowell. Her drug use and repeated mentions of doing this or that bad thing in college feel like she's trying too hard to be edgy and cool.The thing I don't buy the most is her and Archie. I don't feel like Susan likes him. I feel like she's using him. She may have convinced herself that she likes him, or maybe she pities him, but once she's over her own version of the Gretchen Lowell obsession, she won't want anything to do with him. Her life is about the story, and when Archie isn't the story anymore, I don't see her staying around. The same goes for Archie, really. Susan plays into his Gretchen obsession, and now that Gretchen is locked away again and his love of Gretchen has turned into anger, I don't see him lasting too long with Susan.Overall, it was pretty good. If Susan's part in the book had been lessened, I might have even bumped it up to four stars. There isn't very much in the story that couldn't have been done without her, and it would have felt more fluid. Also, I have to take away because that whole bit with Frank and his \"sister\" seemed odd, and it was like it was thrown in there as a last minute \"twist\" without much thought. Because of that, I would like to give it 2.5 stars. I bumped it to three because of the last few chapters with Archie and Gretchen."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael", "userReview": "It would be easy to compare Chelsea Cain's series featuring serial killer Gretchen Lowell to the best-selling series by Robert Harris featuring the unforgettable Hannibal Lecter. Both series have catapulted their respective authors to immense fame and respect within the publishing community and while Harris has the fame, Cain's series about Lowell is showing signs of having better legs for a long-run of stories. Or, at the very least, that Cain has some kind of plan and something new to say in the crowded world of serial killer novels.\"Evil at Heart\" is Cain's third installment in the Gretchen Lowell series and it may be the most chilling. One of the themes explored is the world's fascination with killer Gretchen Lowell, including bus tours of some of her crime scenes, web sites devoted to the killer (including fan fic) and a newspaper editor who wants to find an angle or tie-in to Lowell for each issue to keep newsstand sales at a high rate. In the light of the recent events surrounding the death of Michael Jackson and the media circus that has become, Cain's observations about celebrity and the cult of celebrity that can spring up are extremely timely and well observed. What's more chilling is how far some of these fans are willing to go to emulate Lowell's success. As with previous installments in this series, the novels are not for the faint of heart or those with a low tolerance for scenes of torture. It's not graphic, but Cain deftly weaves in just enough details to allow your imagination to take over and fill in the rest in far more grisly detail than any book could ever hope to do. All of this overcomes a slow start to the story, with things only really taking off and shifting into gear at the halfway point of the novel. What we get in the first half is essential set-up and some work on developing some of these characters, as well as setting up some of the plot twists that come in the novel's second half. But if you're patient, you will be rewarded with an ending that will leave you thinking and wondering when the next installment will be published."}], "description": "Chelsea Cain\u2019s novels featuring Portland detective Archie Sheridan and serial killer Gretchen Lowell have captivated fans through two nail-biting entries, Heartsick and Sweetheart, both of them multiweek bestsellers in The New York Times, USA Today, and Publishers Weekly.Gretchen Lowell is still on the loose. These days, she\u2019s more of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre than a feared killer, thanks to sensationalist news coverage that has made her a star.
