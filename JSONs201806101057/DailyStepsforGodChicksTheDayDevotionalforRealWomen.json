This one will help encourage the reader in their relationship with the Lord. This is a great addition to anyone's library - as with all the books that Holly Wagner has written. This one is no less humorous and enjoyable. Her writing leaves the reader feeling like they are in conversation with a close friend and enjoying great fellowship and bible study. Thank you Gospel Light for this review copy."}, {"userName": "Deborah-Ruth", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9973394-deborah-ruth", "userReview": "In Daily Steps for God Chicks: the Devotional, Holly Wagner offers women a short Bible passage, an exposition of the Scripture (usually from a practical angle) and then ends off with a challenge to her readers. It was a great book in terms of getting me to think through my faith, however, is quite repetitive from the actual \"God Chicks\" book (she uses many of the same stories). Still, a good, easy read if you're into 5 minute devotions or are pressed for time :)"}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5881944-meg", "userReview": "I love God. I love Holly Wagner's books. But this one fell flat for me. I gave this book an extra star for the fact that it is inspirational in a Christian way but otherwise I'm disappointed. For one, the cover art is suggesting more of a teen/young woman age for me, but the inside material is an odd mixture of married older woman and a young teen. Talking about sex with your husband isn't geared toward a teen audience. Overall, I would suggest readers towards GodChicks and the Men They Love or Survival Guide for Young Women and skip this one."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4792771-julie", "userReview": "Really great book!

Based on Proverbs 31, \"Daily Steps for GodChicks\" highlights the characteristics that God has put into every woman to be the best she can be. Holly's desire to draw women closer to God takes on added poignancy as she shares out of her heart and her experience with battling breast cancer this year. Find out why Holly sees spending time with God, reading the Bible and praying as lifelines to the Father.", "title": "Daily Steps for God Chicks: The 90-Day Devotional for Real Women", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10393072-daily-steps-for-god-chicks", "average": 3.91, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1371437369l/10393072.jpg", "reviews": 6, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/288465.Holly_Wagner", "name": "Holly Wagner"}], "type": ["Womens"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10393072-daily-steps-for-god-chicks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3423978-daily-steps-for-god-chicks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1165925.Warrior_Chicks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/892914.God_Chicks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27833541-find-your-brave", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1087234.Daily_Steps_for_Godchicks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23411599-warrior-chicks"]}
