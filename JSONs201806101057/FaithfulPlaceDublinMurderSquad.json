After proving his worth as Cassie Maddox's handler in The Likeness, Francis 'Frank' Mackey is given his own novel, where the reader can explore the deep and emotionally-driven aspects of the man's life. At nineteen, Mackey and his sweetheart, Rosie Daly, planned to leave their dead-end lives in Dublin and cross over to England. When Rosie did not turn up at their rendezvous point, Mackey slumped back home, only to find a 'Dear John' letter, which explained that she chose to flee alone. Feeling jilted, Mackey ran off, never to look back on his family or the life he hoped to soon forget. Just over two decades later, Rosie's suitcase is found around the Mackey home and Frank's emotions come rushing back after a call from his kid sister. Soon a body is discovered that bears forensic similarities to young Rosie Daly and Mackey tries to weasel his way into the investigation, much to the dismay of Dublin Murder Squad star-detective, Scorcher Kennedy. Not only does Frank have to come to terms with the murder of his first love, but he also must return to face his family and the issues he thought he left in his past. If that were not enough, his closeness to the victim and surrounding area has Kennedy blocking his access at every turn. Remembering not only the lead-up to his planned departure with Rosie but also the struggles he faced growing up in a tenement house, Mackey vows never to let his own daughter bear witness to the depravation that almost crippled him, while he juggles processing his lot who have not matured in the two decades since his absence. With Rosie's killer potentially somewhere in the tenement project, someone else close to Mackey dies and all eyes shift on him. Could he have killed Rosie and then tried to cover-up when others began to poke around? Told in her brilliant form, French offers the reader a slow and methodical examination of a central theme while developing the story narrative throughout. A must-read for those who have tired from all the cookie-cutter \"kill/search/find\" police procedurals on the market today.I am as gobsmacked as the next person that French has me speechless (save for this review) three books into the series. There is nothing commonplace about these books or the characters found herein. While I expected a series of cases with the same central murder squad, these books have taken twists and turns I could not have expected, pulling me well beyond simple admiration. This novel seeks to push away from the formal murder investigation as Frank Mackey takes the reins and does his own investigating, introducing readers to a handful (or a score, even) of local and less-refined Dubliners who have always lived in the shadows of tenement houses and blue-collar lives. French does not shy away from their boozing, beating, and belligerent nature, while shaping a story that uses this to her advantage. The narrative is slow as January molasses, but in so being, allows the reader to gaze at all that surrounds them and develop deeper bonds and curiosities. As with each novel, French offers a soap box for a central theme; this one being the role of family. Frank Mackey is forced to return to the childhood home and face the dysfunction that he sought to flee with two ferry tickets over to England. He must admit from where he has come while trying to shield his young daughter from mixing with his own blood. French effectively shows the less than desirable side of the Mackeys and the Dalys, but also the great socio-economic disparities in Dublin, without making a mockery of the entire thing. Class and standing play a central role in one's upbringing, but forgetting one's roots will never erase the past that has shaped the present. A stunning novel that has left me aching to get back over to Ireland sooner than later. I only hope the next story is as captivating, as I have discovered a pattern in French's choice in protagonists.Kudos, Madam French for yet another wonderful novel. I do hope my friends and family will find your work as riveting as I have, as I speak about it on a daily basis.Love/hate the review?

The night faded to a thin sad gray and round the corner a milk cart clattered over cobblestones towards the dairy, and I was still waiting for Rosie Daly at the top of Faithful Place.\"Twenty-two years ago, at the age of nineteen, Detective Frank Mackey had a plan \u2013 a plan to escape his alcoholic father and dysfunctional family with the most enchanting girl ever to emerge from the squalor of the Liberties. But Rosie Daly never showed up and Frank turned his back on his family and his past forever. Until now, when a battered suitcase shows up at Number 16 Faithful Place, and Frank is sucked back into the Place, his memories, and his family all over again. This book is the third in Tana French\u2019s Dublin Murder Squad Series, and I have savored each one nearly equally. It\u2019s not necessary to read them in order, although I find that I am doing so \u2013 more out of habit than anything else. We are introduced to Frank Mackey in book 2, The Likeness, although he doesn\u2019t play the main role in that one as he does here in Faithful Place. A detective in the Dublin Undercover squad, Frank was a bit of a presumptuous jerk in The Likeness, to put it mildly. So I wasn\u2019t sure what I would make of this one to be honest. I shouldn\u2019t have worried because French is extremely adept at writing thoughtful and meticulous character studies that highlight the psychology and nuances of each person she brings to the page. Even if you despise them, you still grow to understand each character and his or her actions. I confess to feeling a deeper appreciation and even a slight fondness towards Frank \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong though, I\u2019m not over the moon here! He\u2019s still a ruthless wise guy, but I do like his brand of humor, and his interactions with his young daughter, Holly, won me over. Frank can\u2019t help becoming involved in the case, despite warnings from Detective Scorcher Kennedy of the Murder Squad to lay low and stay away. Frank runs his own unauthorized undercover investigation, while all the time scorning the practices of the other branch of the Dublin force. \"If you want to hunt like a good little panting puppy dog, shooting off on the trail the second you\u2019re let off the leash, you work Murder. If you want Undercover, and I always did, you learn to hunt the way big cats do: set up your ambush, stay low to the ground and move closer by hidden inches, for as long as it takes.\" The two units clash and add to the entertainment value of the plot. The mystery itself is a bit understated and slow-moving; instead it\u2019s the process of the investigation, the subtle revealing of characters\u2019 motives and behaviors, and the interactions between each player that draws the reader into this one. The atmosphere and grittiness of the setting mingled with the sweetness, hopes and dreams of young lovers make for an absorbing read. This is a well-written series with an interesting look at Irish culture, fascinating and flawed narrators, an unexpected twist or two in the storyline, and typically a thrilling and intense scene towards the end of the book. Tana French is definitely on my list of favorite mystery writers, and I will read the rest of the series as well as anything else she might have up her sleeve! \"In all your life, only a few moments matter. Mostly you never get a good look at them except in hindsight, long after they\u2019ve zipped past you\u2026\""}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "When Frank Mackey was 19, he planned to run away to London with his sweetheart, only she never showed up. Everyone assumed she ran away on her own, including Frank. Decades later, when her suitcase turns up in the chimney of a building being renovated, Frank returns to his old neighborhood to confront the possibility that Rosie Daly never left at all...What would you be willing to die for? That's the question Frank Mackey's father asks him in his youth that sets the tone for most of the book. Another of the running themes is \"no one can mess you up like your family can.\" Faithful Place brings undercover cop Frank Mackey back to his old neighborhood and reunites him with the family he hasn't spoken to in decades. It didn't long for me to figure out why Frank is such a manipulative asshole. It runs in the blood. The poor Dublin neighborhood Frank grew up in is one of the better-developed settings I've ever encountered. You can almost smell the desperation wafting off the pages. Frank's family is a well drawn bunch, all seeming like real people, warts and all.The mystery itself was much easier to crack than in the previous two volumes. I guessed the killer based on a line he uttered somewhere in the first 30% of the story. Frank catching up with me was quite a ride. By the time I was finished, I was glad the sadness parade was over.The third book in Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad series maintains the standard set by the previous two volumes.

After all, he spent 22 years away from the place he grew up and away from his family; and it's only a suitcase found in an abandoned house on his old street, Faithful Place, that can bring Frank back home - and open an old wound that has never healed.\n\"The suitcase was by the window. It was a pale-blue thing with rounded corners, spotted over with big patches of black mold, and it was a crack open; someone had forced the pathetic tin locks. What got to me was how small it was. Olivia used to pack just about everything we owned, including the electric kettle, for a weekend away. Rosie had been heading for a whole new life with something she could carry one-handed.\"\n You see, once upon a time Frank was a 19-year-old raised in the dysfunctional family terrorized by a violent alcoholic father in a poor working neighborhood in Dublin, where you were fine as long as you went to church every Sunday, and always put your family first, and never ever squealed to the police about anything. The street, Faithful Place, was its own little suffocating universe with few hopes for its children to grow up different from their parents, to break out of the familiar rhythms of life.\n\"The rules in my road went like this: no matter how skint you are, if you go to the pub then you stand your round; if your mate gets into a fight, you stick around to drag him off as soon as you see blood, so no one loses face; you leave the heroin to them down in the flats; even if you're an anarchist punk rocker this month, you go to Mass on Sunday; and no matter what, you never, ever squeal on anyone.\"\nBut Frank and his first love Rosie had a plan - run away to England and start their new life together, full of hopes, dreams and expectations. Frank and Rosie were supposed to meet on the night of their getaway - except that Rosie never showed up. What did show up was her suitcase with her birth certificate and ferry tickets meant for their joint getaway - showed up two decades later, found in an abandoned house in Faithful Place. It seems that Rosie never managed to leave the place she so desperately wanted to escape - just like she has never ever left the thoughts of Frank Mackey, now a gruff Undercover Detective.\n\"I had spent my whole adult life growing around a scar shaped like Rosie Daly's absence.\"\nAnd now Frank returns, hoping to solve the mystery of Rosie's death - and immediately gets sucked in right into the life he tried so hard to escape - right into \n\"the bubbling cauldron of crazy that is the Mackeys at their finest.\"\n\n\"In less than a day and a half, I had had enough of my family to last me another twenty-two years. That morning in the shower, I would have bet my soul to Satan that nothing in this world could drag me back into Faithful Place.\"\nWhat I love about Tana French's books is that they are hard to pigeonhole. If I had to describe them - and that includes this one, oh it so does! - I'd say something along the lines: psychological mind-f*ckery that usually starts as a murder mystery and quickly develops into an unsettling character study in a guise of police procedural, with the inevitable result of you coming to deeply care for the said characters just to watch Tana French f*ck up their lives while making your heart ache and leaving your soul shattered. And, of course, this pathetic attempt at a summary does not do her books any justice.******\n\"Here's the real risk in Undercover, in the field and out: you create illusions for long enough, you start thinking you're in control. It's easy to slide into believing you're the hypnotist here, the mirage master, the smart cookie who knows whats real and how all the tricks are done. The fact is you're still just another slack-jawed mark in the audience. No matter how good you are, this world is always going to be better at this game. Its more cunning than you are, its faster and its a whole lot more ruthless. All you can do is try to keep up, know your weak spots and never stop expecting the sucker punch.\"\nFrank Mackey is a cynical man always prepared for the worst after having seen the worst every day on his job; a man who is not a welcome figure in his old neighborhood that does not trust police; and underneath the rough exterior, secretly a man still mourning the loss of Rosie all those years ago, still missing his ex-wife Olivia, and counting his young daughter among what he'd readily die for. Oh, and he's a man who is not ready to let go of the long-standing resentment towards his past and his family - which are the same thing as far as he's concerned. And let's not forget that Frank is the man who, in the eyes of his older brother Shay, has no loyalty towards his family - but who has created his own family, the family he is ready to do anything to fiercely protect, and the family he cannot help but hurt sometimes, because the world can be a mean sonovabitch. His family of one - daughter Holly, a loved and sheltered child who nevertheless has Mackee blood - the blood of that aforementioned \"bubbling cauldron of crazy\" that fiercely protects its own. It's Holly that's never out of Frank's thoughts.\n\"I want my daughter to learn that not everything in this world is determined by how often she hears it or how much she wants it to be true or how many other people are looking. Somewhere in there, for a thing to count as real, there has got to be some actual bloody reality. God knows she's not going to learn that anywhere else. So I'm going to have to teach her all by myself.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to bring up a kid, Jackie. That alone is enough to scare the living daylights out of any sane human being. Throw in the fact that I'm trying to bring her up in a setting where she's constantly being told to think about nothing except fashion, fame and body fat, ignore the man behind the curtain and go buy yourself something pretty... I'm petrified, all the time. I could just about stay on top of it when she was a little kid, but every day shes getting older and I'm getting scareder. Call me crazy, but I kind of like the thought of her growing up in a country where people occasionally have no choice but to focus on something more crucial than dick-replacement cars and Paris Hilton.\"\nFrank Mackey is a gruff seasoned Detective, but his job and the solution to the old disappearance/murder all take a backseat here. What takes central stage are the emotions and complicated family relationships of past and present, all that people dismissively and resentfully refer to as \"baggage\" - just like a literal piece of baggage that finally reveals that Rosie has never made the escape she so desperately wanted.And so we have the rest of the madness, both past and present, forming the rest of the novel's heart and soul. The crazy dysfunctional family with its deep secrets, trying desperately to keep up its face in front of the neighborhood, hiding the damage inflicted by the violent alcoholic father who treats wife and kids as punching bags for his pent-up mindless rage; sibling rivalries that end up being rooted in more than just expected everyday resentment; fierce protectiveness that mixes love and hate indiscriminately; the blind happiness of first love and the blind hate of old resentments; the sharp class divides of then and now that Frank Mackey now has to straddle; and the danger of mixing personal and professional.And we know - because it's a Tana French novel, after all - that in the end there will be no feel-good warm fuzzies, that Frank Mackey will be left raw and hurt and forever changed by the experience, and that the same thing will happen to the reader. And so we brace ourselves for what's to come, and treasure the moments of happiness with the characters we came to care for, knowing that the happiness will not last.4.5 stars - and childish excitement upon learning that Frank Mackey may make a reappearance in French's fifth Dublin Murder Squad novel.----------------------A side note: Despite being marketed as a series, Tana French's Dublin Murder Squad novels are quite stand-alone, related only by a peripheral character in one of them making an appearance as a central character in another - so that you can pick up any one of them as your first Tana French experience. And you should - because they are great.----------For other examples of me gushing over Tana French's novels, see my review of 'In the Woods, my review of 'The Likeness', my review of 'Broken Harbour', and my review of 'The Secret Place'."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "This is a murder mystery. Yes, it really is. Too bad the mystery gets pushed aside to make way for repetitive domestic fiction. Frank Mackey's family is of the Irish Catholic poorer class. The men are alcoholic and violent. The women are typical of any abusive family---placating, cowering, and above all, keeping the family secrets like good little enablers. Nothing new there. A bit of a snore, actually. French's writing is up to its usual standards with regard to form, style, and dialogue. The Irish speech patterns here are interesting for those of us who don't read much from the more traditional Irish yarners. I love the way French's characters insult each other. And the line about ZZ Top had me laughing so hard I was snorting! Then I got a fit of the giggles and laughed till my ribs hurt. Unfortunately, the plot execution in Faithful Place doesn't measure up to her previous work. She does finally come back around and let Mackey solve the mystery, but it's not a credit to the genre. I figured out early on who did it. It's so transparent that I thought surely I must be wrong. I wasn't. The \"why\" of the murder(s) is a little more interesting, but also somewhat predictable. Oh, and Ms. French, the expression is \"spit and image,\" not \"spitting image.\" No expectorating relatives, please.

Following the trend set in 2008\u2019s The Likeness, this is not so much a sequel as a revisiting of the same setting. The protagonist of The Likeness was one of the characters in 2007\u2019s In the Woods, but not the lead. Correspondingly, Frank Mackey, the hero here, was a character in The Likeness, but not the lead. I like how she is doing this and it makes me wonder whom will be her narrator in the next entry, 2012\u2019s Broken Harbor.Though her previous two books were set in Ireland and captured the heart and soul of that culture, she never got as close to brilliant characterization as she does here. These characters live and breathe and the dialogue seems spot on. When I get lost in a story, forgetting momentarily that I am reading, then that author is more than doing her job. French delivers.Blending elements of James Joyce\u2019s Dubliners short story \u201cEveline\u201d and scenes from J.M. Synge\u2019s The Playboy of the Western World, French describes a murder cold case that is personal to the hero. Frank Mackey left home more than 20 years ago and vowed to never go back. His was a stereotypical poor Irish Catholic dysfunctional family, with an alcoholic and abusive father and a long suffering, verbally abusive mother. His was the neighborhood that he did not want his current friends and associates to know from where he had come. So when a discovery brings him back, he finds himself and his daughter caught up in a hypnotically entertaining dramatic thriller.The last quarter of the book was read in one sitting.

While French is ostensibly writing murder mysteries, she is also writing thoughtful psychological profiles of a detective heavily involved in the case. In Faithful Place we dive into Undercover Detective Frank's history, following him as he is drawn back into drama from a home he left decades ago. A suitcase discovered in an abandoned house opens up a host of memories and leads to the discovery of a dead woman. He finds very little of his dysfunctional family has changed, and resolves to leave them behind once more as soon as the case is in competent hands. While the mystery pulls the reader in and subtly drives the plot, the focus is equally on character, relationships and setting. French is brilliant at capturing the mood of a place and time, wrapping it up in a small snow globe--and then shaking it up on the unfortunate lead character. It becomes evident that Frank is replicating many of his father's dysfunctional behaviors in his family interactions. Interestingly for me, I've been able to identify the murderer in both the books I've read. I've come to suspect this is deliberate on the part of French, giving the reader further insight into the lead's particular emotional short-sightedness, and building suspense around that fault line. It's an unusual and delicate narrative choice, but I think French handles it well without much loss of tension.I wondered somewhat at some of the descriptive choices, especially musical, that clearly anchor the story to a specific place and time. The family discussing a potential national economic disaster stands out as well. Somehow it felt jarring more than evocative, but those instances were rare. My most serious quibble comes from the narrative voice; I found myself not entirely believing in Frank's narrative from the perspective of a middle-aged, rough-edged undercover cop. Mostly, I found myself wondering at dichotomy between the sensitivity and nostalgia of his memories, the fact that he seemed emotionally stuck at eighteen after a tragic first love, and his isolated, ruthless existence as a undercover detective. Scenes with his informant in the investigating squad came closest to the manipulation and ruthlessness I expected after reading The Likeness. Overall, however, the writing and character development shines, and I will undoubtedly read French's next book."}, {"userName": "RH Walters", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3055179-rh-walters", "userReview": "What French does best is ally you with her character's deepest wishes, and I was very involved emotionally in her other stories. When Rob in In The Woods desperately tried to solve the mystery of his own childhood the forest seemed to breathe back at him, and when Cassie in The Likeness fell in love with a utopian country house and its creators I understood her desire to stay and belong. Frank, on the other hand, is a swaggering divorced cop with an estranged family and lost first love, but what he misses in this story is his divorced wife and child, cutting off the powerful melancholy that French harnessed in her other work. French's strength as a mystery writer is her nuanced characters and layers of understanding, but as they were lacking in this story it was doubly disappointing to figure out the killer early, which incidentally never happens for me. I hope her next story about Scorcher Kennedy is more personal for her and for us."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "Tana French's books are so good they can always pull me out of a reading slump. \"Faithful Place\" is the third book in her Dublin Murder Squad series, and it centers on the life of Detective Frank Mackey, an undercover officer who has a reputation for breaking the rules. One of the things I enjoy about this series is that each book focuses on a different character, and someone who has a minor role in one book could be the main person in another book. (And if you're new to this series, you don't have to read them in chronological order. You can skip around.) So I have memories of the trash-talking, manipulative Frank from the second book, \"The Likeness,\" which focuses on a female undercover officer, Cassie. But in this third installment in the series, we get a better understanding of Frank's hardscrabble childhood and why he acts so tough all the time.This novel fosters more sympathy for Frank, whose heart was broken when he was 19. He and his girlfriend, Rosie, were going to run away to London together, but the night they were supposed to meet, she never showed up. Decades later, Frank hears news of Rosie, and it forces him to return home to Faithful Place and figure out what really happened that night. He also has to reckon with his family, including those who never forgave him for becoming a cop.Aside from good storytelling and psychological suspense, Tana French's books are a delight to read because they are so well-written. When talking about these books with friends, I describe them as literary mysteries because the writing is so strong. These are great books to have around when you need a reading rescue.

Frenchova je za proteklih par godina postala moja omiljena autorka psiholo\u0161kih triler romana, u kojima neopisivo u\u017eivam. Razlog za to je pre svega njen jedinstveni stil, pristup temi koju obra\u0111uje i savr\u0161ena karakterizacija likova bez koje smatram da ni ne vredi pisati trilere - a u \u010demu ona apsolutno dominira.I \"Kobno mesto\" kao i prethodna dva romana, odlikuje spora i razvu\u010dena radnja, ali upravo to i daje poseban \u0161arm i unosi potrebnu dozu neizvesnoti.U ovom romanu narator je jedan od njenih najbolje portretisanih likova do sada, Frensis (Frenk) Maki, detektiv Tajne jedinice dablinske policije. Nemam nameru da iznosim bilo kakve spojlere, pa bez straha mo\u017eete nastaviti sa \u010ditanjem ovog prikaza :) Dakle, Frenk poti\u010de iz radni\u010dke irske porodice, oduvek je \u017eeleo ne\u0161to vi\u0161e od \u017eivota i to ne\u0161to je i na\u0161ao. Ali, 22 godine kasnije, pro\u0161lost sa svim svojim avetima je pokucala na njegova vrata. Misteriozna sudbina dvoje mladih ljubavnika, dovoljno hrabrih da poveruju da mogu sve samo ako su zajedno, promeni\u0107e sudbine \u010ditavog kraja iz koga su potekli - Fejtful Plejsa (da, to je i naziv romana, a za\u0161to je kod nas preveden kao Kobno mesto je jo\u0161 jedna od misterija univerzuma :) )Frenchova na sjajan na\u010din do\u010darava irski duh, kao i \u017eivot radni\u010dkih porodica koji sastavljaju kraj sa krajem od prvog do prvog u mesecu, sklonost ka alkoholu, nasilje u porodici, veliki broj dece, i okrenutost Bogu. Njeni junaci, heroji i antiheroji, zlikovci, ljudi su od krvi i mesa, kojih ima u svakom sokaku i ulici. Frenk Maki, kao pripoveda\u010d u ovom romanu, izdominirao je od prve do poslednje stranice. Postepeno, mic po mic, \u010dovek mi se prikrao i uvukao pod ko\u017eu, tako da sam tamo oko 200. stranice imala ose\u0107aj kao da smo stari drugari iz kraja koji se dugo nisu videli, ali koji bi nastavili sa pri\u010dom kad bi se sreli. U jednom trenutku sam imala utisak da bih Frenka mogla da prepoznam na ulici kada bih ga srela (da, znam da je re\u010d o izmi\u0161ljenom liku :)).Frenk mi je najdra\u017ei lik iz ovog serijala, pun mana, tvrdoglav (ta\u010dnije bandoglav), ali jedan od onih junaka koji i dalje duboko u sebi veruje u pravdu, iako dobro zna da je ta Dama odavno slepa. Znate ve\u0107, jedan od onih tipova koje biste voleli da imate na svojoj strani za slu\u010daj da stvari postanu gadne. Slede\u0107a re\u010denica mo\u017eda na najbolji na\u010din opisuje tu njegovu pomalo i\u0161\u010da\u0161enu prirodu koju ne mo\u017ee\u0161 da ne voli\u0161:\"Mnogi su mi govorili - poneki \u010dak u pohvalnom smislu - da imam od Boga dar da ubijem ljude u pojam; a to \u0161to mo\u017ee\u0161 raditi nepoznatima nije ni\u0161ta u pore\u0111enju sa onim \u0161to mo\u017ee\u0161 raditi rodu ro\u0111enom.\"Nadam se da \u0107emo Frenki i ja nastaviti dru\u017eenje u nekom od narednih romana Tane French."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "[Why did the police not see Frank as a suspect?

You see, Frank Mackey here investigates the disappearance of his first love who he for over 20 years thought dumped him and ran away to England. The whole narrative is laced with Frank's memories of Rosie and their teenage romance. I didn't quite expect it, but the story gave me goosebumps like only a very few teen novels about first love ever did. This is probably the main reason why Faithful Place is my favorite of Tana French's novels, at least for now. The other reason is Frank. I love his voice, he is funny and sarcastic and can bullshit people into doing just about anything. He is also vulnerable and fragile and damaged. Who doesn't like reading about a man like that?And then there is Frank's family. They are a group of sad cases and yet, strangely, they all are lovable and relatable in some strange way, even the worst of them. Finally, my last \"plus\" - out of all 3 books in the series, Faithful Place is the most \"Irish.\" It gives a very honest and often harsh view of the working class living in Ireland. Not quite the picture you get after reading Fever books.On the other hand, the mystery in this novel is probably the most straight-forward and obvious. I knew (well, guessed right) the perp probably by the middle.It doesn't take away, however, from the fact that Faithful Place is, if not a strong mystery, a very personal, very nostalgic, very tender story..."}, {"userName": "James Thane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483907-james-thane", "userReview": "I enjoyed very much Tana French's first two novels, In the Woods and The Likeness, but I think that this book, her third, is by far her best work. It's another atmospheric character-driven story, featuring Frank Mackey, the Dublin police detective that French first introduced in The Likeness.As a nineteen-year-old boy, Mackey was living in Faithful Place, one of Dublin's poorer neighborhoods, jammed into a tiny home with his brothers, sisters and ever-battling parents. It was a grim, depressing place, and few people ever seemed to escape from it. The culture of poverty being what it is, most of the young people in Faithful Place simply grew up to turn into their parents.Young Frank, though, was desperately in love with Rosie Daly, a neighbor whose father forbid the romance, assuming that his own family, poor as it might be, was well above the Mackeys. Frank and Rosie determined to escape their families and their destinies by running away to London. They saved their money, bought the tickets, and on the night they were to leave, Frank sneaked out of his house to wait for Rosie.She never showed up.Late that night, Frank found a note from Rosie, apparently intended for him, indicating that she had decided to leave alone. Broken hearted, Frank never returned home but rather left without a word himself and ultimately wound up in the Guard, the Dublin police force, something that would have made him an outcast in his old neighborhood and in his family as well.Frank married, had a child of his own, and divorced without ever telling his family of the marriage or the child. Now, twenty-two years after that fateful night, Frank's sister Jackie, the one family member with whom he has remained in contact, calls him to say that Rosie Daly's suitcase has been found in an abandoned home in Faithful Place.The discovery upends Frank's life. For all those years he assumed that Rosie had simply ditched him and gone to England alone. But the discovery of the suitcase suggests that something much different might have happened.For the first time after all those years, Frank returns home to examine the suitcase and launch a personal investigation into Rosie's disappearance. Once again, he find himself deeply immersed in the affairs of the dysfunctional family into which he was born and from which he thought he had escaped forever. And along the way, he will discover some hard, shocking truths about himself and the people of Faithful Place.In addition to being a compelling suspense novel, this book is a powerful meditation on the nature of family life and on the obligations that one either assumes or has forced upon him simply by the act of being born into a family. It's beautifully written with great characters and it's hard to imagine any reader that would not treasure this book. I can hardly wait to get my hands on Tana French's next novel."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1233686-megan", "userReview": "At this point, after reading Faithful Place I am pretty much an official Tana French fangirl and am afraid that all further reviews of her work will be reduced to inept gushing over how, like, totally awesome her novels are. These glowing reviews are also gonna include rants about people who dislike her books, how they are stupid fecking eejits who clearly aren\u2019t reading these books the right way ;)Seriously, though there are quite a few reviews of Faithful Place here on Goodreads which criticize French for making protagonist Frank Mackey sound too much like a woman, and not enough like a cynical, divorced, undercover cop. These people must not have read The Likeness, French\u2019s second novel, where we officially meet Frank. There, we see him through Detective Cassie Maddox\u2019s eyes as the cynical arsehole he is. Just one of the things I love about Faithful Place is that we still see moments when Frank does whatever it takes to meet his ends, but we also see who he really is, what his soft spots are, and what made him that way. Had French written this novel showing us Frank just as disenchanted and snarky on the inside as he presents himself to be, this novel would not have been nearly as interesting. Seeing both sides of Frank makes him a much better character. Besides, French already did sarcastic and cynical with Rob Ryan in In the Woods. Speaking of which, people who say French cannot write a male protagonist have evidently not read that book\u2026.You see, fangirl rants! Really, that\u2019s all I can do when \u201creviewing\u201d this novel. It\u2019s hard to put into words what exactly I loved about this. French\u2019s writing is so engrossing, her characters amazingly flawed and believable, and her settings so realistic. For a proper review, let me refer you to Tatiana. Here, I\u2019m simply going to finish by saying I have been giving each book in this series four stars. But the third time book is a charm. Rather than being so stingy with those stars, this one gets five stars, as do The Likeness and In the Woods. (Of course, if Tana French never takes us back to Rob Ryan\u2019s mystery, I fully reserve the right to take these all back down to four stars!)"}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5240149-brenda", "userReview": "I've now read the first three books in the Dublin Murder Squad, and this is the best so far. It's not necessary to read the first two before reading this one, and if you want a really great book, go ahead and skip right to this one. I was absolutely taken by Francis (Frank) Mackey. I got to know his friends, his family, his life. Dialogue was top-notch, from the heart, and often so freaking funny! I found myself reading with an accent! I love Tana French's turn of phrase: Ma grabbed the \"soft skin of Frank's arm with a lobster pinch.\" He caught \"his sister's eye and sent her the superurgent sibling distress signal.\" I also became immersed in the culture of Faithful Place, with noisy, nosey neighbors, dysfunctional families hiding secrets, and teens trying to escape dismal lives.

There is not a recurring cast of characters from one book to the next, other than one person \u2013 a single different character in each succeeding story\u2013 who appears in the next novel, never to be seen again in following books, except, perhaps, for a brief mention. In Faithful Place, the third of the batch, we get Frank Mackey, whom we met in The Likeness as Detective Cassie Maddox\u2019s undercover boss. Like the two previous books, Faithful Place is unique. Our senses are not assailed with images of squad rooms littered with paper, coffee cups, and overflowing ashtrays. Nor are we frequently privy to seeing suspects interrogated in claustrophobia-inducing rooms with one-way mirrors. Oh, there are cops, to be sure. Frank is one of them. Only this time, he is ordered to stay clear, because the first victim is someone he knew 22 years earlier, someone he loved. He was a teenager back then. The next victim is someone closer than that. Most of the story takes place in Francis \u201cFrank\u201d Mackey\u2019s old street, Faithful Place. It\u2019s a down-and-out area where folks know each other\u2019s business, like who\u2019s a drunk, who beats his wife, and who\u2019s sleeping with someone else\u2019s girlfriend or wife. But when it comes to murder, they won\u2019t be talking to the police; at least they might not be tellin\u2019 the truth \u2013 or the whole truth. Francis, who left Faithful Place more than two decades earlier, is finding that out the hard way. Frank left Faithful Place and eventually joined \u201cthe Guard\u201d. His sister Jackie\u2019s frantic phone call has brought him home. Now we learn what growing up in the Place was like, and why Frank has never returned. But to some of his relatives, family is family, no matter what. Can Frank make peace with them?Tana French is a marvelous storyteller with a wonderful ear for dialect and dialogue. She brings her characters to life. I felt that I knew each and every one of Frank\u2019s siblings, his parents, and neighbors. I loved his little daughter Holly, and I even liked his ex-wife Olivia. With all of the characters, the author takes time to develop relationships and show us who these people are, how they live, how they fight, and how they love. In addition to Frank\u2019s family, former friends and neighbors in the Place, I also liked I Stephen Moran, the young detective that Frank enlists to keep him up to speed on the investigation. He\u2019s smart and he\u2019s a great contrast to Frank\u2019s Once Rosie\u2019s body is discovered, we see Frank become obsessed with his memories of her. I didn\u2019t particularly care for him in The Likeness, but now I understand where he came from and who he is. I still don\u2019t love him, exactly, but I do respect him, and I like him as a father to his daughter.The more I read of this series, the more it grows on me. I can\u2019t wait to see what happens in Broken Harbour with Scorcher Kennedy, a character I really didn\u2019t like \u2013 perhaps French will be able to change my mind about him as well!

He, because of unanswered questions from his past, is reluctantly but inevitably drawn back to the place that he has successfully ( for twenty plus years so far ) avoided. In true Tana French style this one doesn't disappoint as a hard hitter and suspense grinder. I thoroughly enjoyed this as (I've frequently stated ) that Francis is and will always be one of my fave characters.I seriously can't get enough of his witty nature and enjoy his dialogue and interaction with every character he communicates with. I always get all Sherlock Holmes when I read her books and I swear that this is me while I read and try to figure out who done it...Tea and all peoples *Wink Wink*\nI love trying to figure out the Who, When and Why of the murder.

It isn\u2019t just any old whodunit sleuthing story, but a great, emotionally charged story about love, longing and dysfunctional families that definitely raises the bar in the mystery genre. Her voice is fresh and believable. The prologue completely sucked me in and I had to buy this book. I don\u2019t normally read prologues; they often seem weird and confusing to me so I skim the first few sentences, head straight for chapter one, then maybe I'll go back and read them once I\u2019m committed. But not this time, not this one:\"In all your life, only a few moments matter. Mostly you never get a good look at them except in hindsight, long after they've zipped past you: the moment when you decided whether to talk to that girl, slow down on that blind bend, stop and find that condom. I was lucky, I guess you could call it. I got to see one of mine face-to-face, and recognize it for what it was. I got to feel the riptide pull of my life spinning around me, one winter night while I waited in the dark at the top of Faithful Place.I was nineteen, old enough to take on the world and young enough to be a dozen kinds of stupid...\"Brilliant. Tana French does an outstanding job of setting the tone, setting up the main character, Francis Mackey, as the now long suffering middle-aged detective haunted by an event from his past.\u201c\u2026Over more than half my life it had worn itself a nice little corner in my mind, like a bullet lodged too deep to dig out; I didn\u2019t feel the sharp edges, mostly, as long as I didn\u2019t touch.\u201dI couldn't help but fall in love with Frank Mackey, and find out his story. He's complicated, real, and oh so believable. The pacing was perfect and as the plot unfolded, I was on the edge of my seat. Flashbacks are handled skillfully and without confusion. Every character is rich and well rounded with their Irish slang and quick wit. I laughed. I cried.

When I'm reading her books, more than with any other author I've ever read, I feel ensorcelled. Like, I'm being pulled in to the book with ropes that have been tied around my emotions, and it's entirely not in my control how much I'm allowed to be inside the story. Her books are wrenching. So much humanity in there. Joy and suffering and pain and longing and regret. All at the same time. Plus a murder mystery!I'm almost more impressed with her after reading this book. It was easy to get me to fall in love with Rob and Cassie in their respective books (In the Woods and The Likeness), but Detective Frank Mackey rubbed me the wrong way from the get go back from when we first met him in The Likeness. So the fact that I was so emotionally invested in his story by the end of this book, had in fact fallen a little bit in love with him and his messed up family, is probably the best testament to her writing and character work that I can give. I also found the story she was writing this time to be a more uncomfortable experience, and I tend to shy away from those as a reader. So again, the fact that I gobbled this book up like it was ice cream says something about her skills.Nominally, this is a story about Frank finally coming to terms with the disappearance of the love of his life. Rosie Daly and Frank Mackey planned to run away to London when they were nineteen, but on the night they were set to leave, Rosie never showed up, and Frank assumed she'd gone without him. He never got over her leaving him. Only, now that her suitcase has been found in an abandoned house on the street where he grew up, it seems the story of what actually happened to Rosie Daly is still a mystery. I say nominally, because this isn't just a story about a guy getting over his murdered girlfriend and solving her murder. It goes a lot deeper than that. This is really a story about coming to terms with the things you wanted but will never have. It's a story about knowing when to stop fighting, and what happens if you don't.I can't sing the praises of these books loudly enough. I can't believe it took me so long to finally start reading them. I can't believe I only have one more left to read.[4.5 stars]"}, {"userName": "Alex is The Romance Fox", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6663962-alex-is-the-romance-fox", "userReview": "I have read two books in this series, Book #1 In the Woods and Book # The Likeness - I liked both of them but I must be honest and say that Book #3, Faithful Place, didn't do it for me.I didn't connect with the characters and I found Frank Mackey, the main protagonist (who we met in the previous book) really cold and remote.

The first time I got out, it had let me run for 22 years before it jerked the leash tight. The second time, it had given me 36 hours.And there I was again, back with Miss Tana French, just like I had never been away. Her first book, holy shit. What an introduction to police procedural where the author really didn't give a fuck about examining a case as much as examining a mind. Her second? Proved her first was no fluke. Now on her third brilliant book, I'm experiencing slight panic that I'm already halfway through her novels.There have been no missteps or disappointments to date as I make my way through the Dublin Murder Squad series. Reading French's work is simultaneously comforting (hooray for good writing and nostalgia and dialogue and plotting and suspense) and uncomfortable (as you travel down the rabbit hole with the narrators into the dark places of their minds, you literally start to feel the room close in on you).With each books' final pages, I'm left with too many unanswered questions, and too much concern for main characters. I'm reminded how fragile we all are, and how much baggage we've got. Frank Mackey, the narrator of Faithful Place (and whom we are first introduced to in The Likeness), is no exception. As with In the Woods, French displays how well she can write men. We wouldn't hear Cassie, our narrator in The Likeness, call someone a \"squealing little arse-gerbil,\" for instance, or deliberately pick a fight so she could get punched in the face to take her pain away. But that's our guy Frank this time around. Frank is Undercover (he thinks Murder is basically a bunch of pansies); he's scrappy and the definition of self-made. At age 19, he turns his back on his childhood neighborhood Faithful Place and his big, loud Irish family--complete with alcoholic Da and a bitter Ma--after the love of his life leaves him a Dear John note and heads to England without him. ... Or did she?Twenty-two years later, evidence emerges that proves Frank's love never made it to England, and foul play is confirmed. Consequently, Frank heads back to Faithful Place--confronting his family in the process--to search for answers. Things get messy: The world felt lethal that night ... The tricky shiver in the air a reminder: everything you believe is up for grabs, every ground rule can change on a moment's whim, and the dealer always, always wins.I've nothing to say about Faithful Place other than to heap all the praise on it that it deserves. In some ways, it's French's most impressive novel to date, just because I see more than ever what type of range she's capable of with her narrators and dialogue.I'm 99 percent certain I've pegged who the narrator will be in the fourth book. It will be interesting to get a full picture of my suspect, as opposed to letting the present narrator color my opinions. This technique--being re-introduced to characters from the previous book and realizing the past narrator had left out important information--is just one of the gazillion reasons I feel my already-serious-French-girl-crush growing.Bravo."}], "description": "That which was buried is brought to light and wreaks hell -- on no one more so than Frank Mackey, beloved undercover guru and burly hero first mentioned in French's second book about the Undercover Squad, The Likeness. Faithful Place is Frank's old neighborhood, the town he fled twenty-two years ago, abandoning an abusive alcoholic father, harpy mother, and two brothers and sisters who never made it out. They say going home is never easy, but for Frank, investigating the cold case of the just-discovered body of his teenage girlfriend, it is a tangled, dangerous journey, fraught with mean motivations, black secrets, and tenuous alliances. Because he is too close to the case, and because the Place (including his family) harbors a deep-rooted distrust of cops, Frank must undergo his investigation furtively, using all the skills picked up from years of undercover work to trace the killer and the events of the night that changed his life.", "title": "Faithful Place\n      \n          (Dublin Murder Squad #3)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7093952-faithful-place", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1291165900l/7093952.jpg", "reviews": 6227, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/138825.Tana_French", "name": "Tana French"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Thriller", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7093952-faithful-place", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9128231-faithful-place", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9128233-faithful-place", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22022575-kobno-mesto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8292350-faithful-place", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27250120", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8602351-faithful-place", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237209.In_the_Woods", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1914973.The_Likeness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10805160-broken-harbour", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821043-the-secret-place", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29430013-the-trespasser", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35005051-the-forgotten-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
