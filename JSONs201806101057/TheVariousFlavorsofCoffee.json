The impoverished poet is sitting in a London coffeehouse contemplating an uncertain future when he meets Samuel Pinker. The owner of Castle Coffee offers Wallace the very last thing a struggling young artiste in fin de si\u00e8cle England could possibly want: a job.But the job Wallis accepts\u2014employing his palate and talent for words to compose a \u201cvocabulary of coffee\u201d based on its many subtle and elusive flavors\u2014is only the beginning of an extraordinary adventure in which Wallis will experience the dizzying heights of desire and the excruciating pain of loss. As Wallis finds himself falling hopelessly in love with his coworker, Pinker\u2019s spirited suffragette daughter Emily, both will discover that you cannot awaken one set of senses without affecting all the others.Their love is tested when Wallis is dispatched on a journey to North Africa in search of the legendary Arab mocca.\u00a0As he travels to coffee\u2019s fabled birthplace\u2014and learns the fiercely guarded secrets of the trade\u2014Wallis meets Fikre, the defiant, seductive slave of a powerful coffee merchant, who serves him in the traditional Abyssinian coffee ceremony. And when Fikre dares to slip Wallis a single coffee bean, the mysteries of coffee and forbidden passion intermingle\u2026and combine to change history and fate. My Review: Um. Well. Uh. I have a problem here. I started reading one book, thinking I was getting one kind of thing, and I ended up getting rather another, and along the way I oscillated between irked and amused often enough that I thought I was on some sort of story-magneto, swinging from pole to pole.There's a good deal of energy in this tale, no doubt about that. It's got a swinging pace, it's got an emotional charge from its characters' absurdities and failings, and it's set at a time of radical change which is always good for a sense of urgency.The irked pole on the mageto, for me, was narrator Robert himself. His studied, dandyish pose of Oscar Wildean epigrammatic speech made me homicidal. That the conceit of the book is a tale told in retrospect prevented me from hurling the damn thing aside, as the narrator-Robert shared my amused, then annoyed response to character-Robert, is both a good and a bad thing. I got the sense that narrator-Robert and I were in cahoots, smiling with impatient indulgence on the emotional excesses and self-delusions of Those Young People. It also popped me out of the story a good deal, at least until I'd made my peace with its narrative drag on the pace.Also on the irked pole of the swing was the romance Robert clearly has with himself, and extends to Emily, a Modern Girl (in the 1897 meaning of those words) working (!) in her father's firm before entering into marriage. As Robert is hired to create a coffee vocabulary with Emily's help, the story being told about coffee seemed to suffer from the superposition of A Romance. That the romance was doomed (not a spoiler, Robert says so) is no surprise whatsoever. No one's first love is his last. More to the point, Robert's constant use of prostitutes isn't gonna fly with a Modern Girl, and one can always rest assured that the secret one least wants revealed will be known by those one least wants to know it at the worst, most embarrassing moment. In fiction as in life. So the doomed-ness of the romance was crystal clear and left me waiting for the other shoe to drop, rather than being a sad case of readerly anticipation followed by a wistful sense of opportunity lost. It might be an inevitability of the retrospective structure used here. I would have thought, however, that the author would have expended more effort in making this Grand Passion more immediate, no matter the structure.But the real annoyance to me was the occasional interpolation of present-tense bits into this review of the life and times of Robert, when the PoV shifts to others. If these aren't Robert's memories, why are they here? So annoying to have the rules the author himself chose broken with such complete, unexplained violence. So. Annoying.But there were positive pole-swings, too, and really good ones. The author has narrator-Robert decrying the change from Victorian to Edwardian worlds, from hidden, gaslit Vices to unforgiving, electrically lit Morality...a point I found really interesting. The backdrop of Africa was also deeply felt and wonderfully evocative. I have no gauge to measure its accuracy, as I've never been to East Africa, but it felt wonderful and enfolding and right to me. The author, I will note, was born in Uganda. This makes me inclined to trust his evocation of place.But the main pleasure the book afforded me was coffee. The smell, the taste, the politics, the essence of the world in these pages is coffee. The vocabulary character-Robert develops with Emily, the first of its kind, is delightful. The descriptions of the coffees, their differences, their quirks, all superbly rendered and skillfully deployed to avoid both the dreaded info-dump and the (inexplicably, to me) less-dreaded light garnish or inadequate gilding of fact on a wodge of story that could be anywhere, anywhen, about anything and/or nothing.And while I've mentioned in positive terms the pace the author sets in the book, I can't overlook the sheer length of the opus. Over 500 pages. Oh dear. One hundred fewer, with the simple alteration of no annoying PoV switches, and I think this would have been a more exciting, more fully enfolding book.It's a good read that could have been excellent. *sigh*\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Gayle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/264226-gayle", "userReview": "This was an interesting book - a mix of love story, adventure, women's history and coffee growing text book. The first 100 pages are dry and I found myself wondering why this book had been so highly recommended at the library. Once the main character is sent on his African safari style adventure it picks up and becomes quite interesting. There are some graphic scenes in the section that covers one of the characters involvment with the militant women's rights movement (a step by step discription of a woman on a hunger strike in person being force fed) but overall it was interesting. I loved the ending. Ultimately I can only give it an \"okay\" because I feel the book tries to be too much - if it had stuck with the african story or the love story or the woman's rights story and expanded it would have been fascinating. As it is, it's just enough to get you interested, then it jumps to another subject. I'd have to read Capella's other novels to decide if this is just the author's style, or simply an overambitious attempt."}, {"userName": "Carey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1496307-carey", "userReview": "\"A well made cup of coffee is the proper beginning to an idle day. Its aroma is beguiling, its taste is sweet; yet it leaves behind only bitterness and regret. In that it resembles, surely, the pleasures of love.....Although in this case, it seems to taste of nothing much except mud. With, perhaps, a faint aftertaste of rotten apricots.\"With these words Robert Wallis seals his fate. Not that it didn't need to be sealed. After having been expelled from Oxford (too much partying, no studying) and cut off by his father, Robert is living in London on credit from various tradesmen. He is the very picture of a dandy, dressing in the most fashionable manner, writing marginal poetry by day and visiting local brothels by night. A dissolute young man who is nevertheless endearing from the very first page.While sitting in a cafe one morning his remark is overheard by coffee merchant Samuel Pinker. Mr. Pinker wants to develop a reference manual to describe the tastes & smells in the various coffee beans that he imports. He needs someone with a discerning palate and the vocabulary necessary to complete the task. He offers Robert the very last thing that he wants, employment. But even Robert realizes that he will not be able to maintain his lifestyle with no income, so he reluctantly accepts.The dreadful dullness of employment is greatly reduced when Robert meets his assistant. Mr. Pinker's lovely daughter, Emily, serves as secretary and partner in the task. Robert, of course, is attracted to her (and her father's wealth). He feels that he is a wonderful catch, a view not shared by Mr. Pinker. In order to win her hand he is given a mission. A five year trek to Africa, to plant and grow a crop of the best kind of coffee available. Obviously this kind of job is not to Robert's taste but again, he sees that his life has left him few options and he agrees to go.Africa will profoundly change Robert in ways that he cannot begin to imagine. The man who returns to London has learned hard lessons and survived harrowing experiences. The years have changed London and its inhabitants, as well. When he returns he will have to rebuild his life and try create a future for himself. Mr. Capella has written a fantastic historical novel. He brilliantly describes London at the end of the nineteenth century with all of its wonderful depth, from the glamorous upper class drawing rooms to the seedy, poverty stricken streets. Then he takes us to the dusty plains and steamy jungles of Africa and introduces us to the native people, showing us their struggle to maintain their way of life in the face of outsiders in search of wealth and land. It is a rich, evocative, compelling story and I loved it."}, {"userName": "Uci ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/619633-uci", "userReview": "\"Anggap mereka seperti pasukan tentara...Setiap resimen punya tempat asal, watak, tetapi setiap resimen terdiri atas individu-individu, pejuang-pejuang yang sudah melepas identitas pribadi mereka untuk menjadi satu kesatuan...Dan persis seperti pasukan tentara mengaktifkan kavaleri tergantung tugasnya, maka campuran bisa menyelamatkan kopi Brasil yang lembut dengan sejumput kopi Sumatra, atau menutupi kekurangan dari satu kelompok dengan sifat-sifat terbaik kelompok lain.\"Seperti halnya rempah-rempah, kopi menjadi komoditas penting yang ikut berperan dalam mengukuhkan penjajahan bangsa Eropa atas bangsa kulit berwarna. Kopi yang di Afrika dibiarkan tumbuh liar dan dipanen secukupnya (sehingga menghasilkan kopi bermutu yang mahal), diubah menjadi industri oleh bangsa Eropa. Perkebunan luas yang dibuat dengan membabat hutan, perbudakan untuk memperoleh tenaga kerja, dan ketika sampai di Inggris, kopi-kopi bermutu dari berbagai belahan dunia dicampur dengan kopi yang tidak terlalu bagus guna mendapatkan keuntungan sebesar-besarnya. Maka legenda rakyat di Ethiopia tentang asal-usul kopi terasa sangat sesuai. Menurut legenda tersebut, air mata pahit Tuhan jatuh ke atas makam si penyihir; dan di tempat air matanya jatuh, semak kopi pertama tumbuh. (hal. 616) Untuk bisa terhidang dalam cangkir-cangkir cantik di meja orang kulit putih, di Afrika atau Amerika Latin sana ratusan orang harus bekerja keras tanpa bayaran yang adil.Membaca novel setebal 677 halaman ini bagaikan menelusuri sejarah kopi yang penuh darah dan air mata, juga kisah-kisah ajaib dan luar biasa. Saya pun makin sadar bahwa bagi penikmat sejati, kopi-kopi instan yang dijual massal dengan rasa yang terstandardisasi mungkin terasa palsu karena sejatinya, kopi dari tiap daerah memiliki keunikan dan rasa tersendiri, tergantung tempat tumbuhnya. Tentu saja ada kisah cinta dalam buku ini, karena Capella selalu bercerita tentang cinta sepasang manusia dalam novel-novelnya. Tapi saya puas dengan proporsi antara percintaan dan sejarah dalam novel ini. Percintaannya tidak mengalahkan cerita tentang kopi. Di awal kisah, karakter Robert Wallis, si tokoh utama, sama sekali tidak mengundang simpati. Tipe orang yang menggampangkan hidup dan bertingkah seenaknya. Tapi perjalanan ke Afrika yang dipaksakan kepadanya membuat dia lambat laun berubah. Saya pun senang karena di sana dia mendapat pelajaran yang benar-benar pahit karena mengira bisa menaklukkan seorang perempuan Afrika cantik dengan membebaskannya dari perbudakan. Dan bukan Capella jika tidak melebarkan ceritanya ke sana kemari meskipun masih berkaitan dengan tema utama. Dalam novel ini kita juga disuguhi sekelumit sejarah tentang bursa komoditas, perjuangan kaum perempuan di Inggris yang menuntut persamaan hak, serta awal mula iklan dan produksi bahan pangan secara massal yang dijual ke seluruh dunia.Tapi yang paling membekas bagi saya setelah menutup novel ini adalah ketamakan dan kejahatan penjajahan atas nama peradaban. Para penjajah mengira sudah kewajiban mereka untuk membawa peradaban ke seluruh dunia, tak peduli dengan cara apa pun. Pertanyaan orang-orang kepada Wallis sepulangnya dia dari Afrika dengan keyakinan baru bahwa bangsa Eropa tidak berhak mencampuri kehidupan bangsa lain adalah: \"Tetapi kalau begitu, Mr. Wallis, apa yang harus Dilakukan dengan Afrika? (hal. 498)Sempat terlintas kalau Capella mungkin mendapat ide dari kedai-kedai kopi yang cabangnya menggurita ke seluruh dunia. Karena dalam kondisi demikian, yang menjadi ukuran adalah angka-angka, bukan aroma kopi yang dipanggang atau kualitas biji kopi yang diperoleh hari ini. Bukan pula perdagangan adil bagi petani-petani kopi yang menjual hasil panennya dengan harga murah untuk kemudian dijual dengan harga berkali lipat di kedai-kedai tersebut.

The passages describing how coffee tastes, how each type of coffee tastes and feels, those passages are lovely to read. The story itself isn't so fabulous for the first 3/4 of the book. The protagonist is a self-centered shallow twit and about the hundredth time we've been treated to the same sort of description of just what a self-centered shallow twit he is, I had to re-read the reviews to see if I wanted to keep reading.The last quarter of the book is magnificent and worth all the slogging to get to it. Drama, drama everywhere, all expressed in achingly beautiful prose. The building and breaking of fortunes by manipulating the stock market was eerily familiar to our current economic crisis and fascinating to follow.

Mungkin karena kandungan kafein di dalamnya yang memacu detak jantung lebih cepat dan juga memacu asam lambung untuk berproduksi sehingga hanya kembung yang kurasakan ketika memaksakan diri menenggak segelas kopi yang berbau harum untuk memaksa mata tetap melotot ketika lelah.Sialnya, aku mencintai aroma kopi.Lalu kusadari, masalahku dengan kopi ini hanya terjadi ketika minum kopi instan dalam sachet. Semua kopi sachet yang kuminum, sampai yang namanya terkenal secara internasional pun berefek sama pada perutku. Sampai aku menemukan satu merk yang dihidangkan padaku ketika aku meeting di pabrik pembuatnya. Yang juga memproduksi permen kopi terkenal. Harumnya membuatku mencicipnya sedikit ketika masih panas dan berbuih. Eih, satu jam, dua jam, sampai pulang, tak bermasalah dengan perutku. Akhirnya sesekali aku mencobanya, hanya dengan merk dan jenis itu. Namun memang kopi itu harus diminum dalam kondisi tertentu. Kadang aku nyaman meminumnya, kadang juga tidak. Mungkin ada satu kondisi lelah yang tak tertanggungkan oleh kopi.Awal tahun ini aku terbang ke Belitong. Di sana terkenal dengan kedai kopinya sebagai tempat bermasyarakat, bersosialisasi antar penduduknya. Aku mencoba minum kopi di saat sarapan di satu kedainya. Aromanya yang harum, dari bubuk kopi lokal yang dimasak terus menerus di tungku batu, menguarkan bau yang menggoda untuk dicicip. Dan ternyata, tidak bermasalah dengan perutku.Aku jarang minum kopi kecuali butuh. Dan terkadang aku lebih memilih minuman lainnya untuk menjaga mata dari kantuk. Namun kopi-kopi lokal ini, yang dimasak dengan air mendidih, bukan dengan air dispenser, memang memberikan sensasi menggoda. Sehingga aku pun jadi rajin mencobai kopi-kopi lokal di tempat-tempat yang kudatangi.Membaca buku ini membuatku merindukan lagi harumnya kopi. Bagaimana ia berada di gudang dan meraup segenggam biji kopi untuk dibaui, membuatku kembali ke gudang harum di belakang toko Kopi Aroma Bandung. Cara menikmati kopi dengan mencium dan menyesapnya sebagai teman diskusi membuatku percaya bahwa peminum kopi adalah pemikir. Bertualang mencari bibit kopi terbaik hingga Afrika dan Brasil, hingga sejarah moka yang berasal dari kota Mecca. Dalam beberapa cerita lain yang pernah kubaca juga dikisahkan bahwa kopi dibawa ke Indonesia oleh pedagang dari Arab.Kopi yang tersaji dari rumah hingga gelas di warung atau di kafe mahal di sebuah pusat perbelanjaan memberikan gengsi pada lokasi meminumnya.Tapi untukku tempat minum kopi hanya satu : di material berbahan gelas.

Saya jadi impulsif gara-gara ada kata kopi pada judulnya. Sebagai penikmat kopi (meskipun lebih sering minum kopi instan), saya merasa wajib membaca novel yang satu ini. Dan ketika saya membuka halaman pertama, saya tahu membaca buku ini seperti menikmati secangkir kopi. Sesapi rasanya perlahan-lahan, rasakan kepahitan, manis, legit, dan aroma kopi memenuhi pikiranmu. Dan ketika halaman terakhir ditutup, ada rasa puas dan menyenangkan yang ditimbulkan seperti efek secangkir kopi.Robert Wallis, seorang pria yang pandai merangkai kata, menjalani hidupnya dengan gaya mewah dan dipenuhi wanita penghibur. Robert selalu ingin menjadi seperti penulis favoritnya, Oscar Wilde. Di suatu ketika, saat keuangannya sudah mulai menipis, dia masuk ke sebuah kafe dan memesan secangkir kopi. Tetapi saat dia meminum kopinya, seketika itu juga dia mengumpat karena kopi itu berasa seperti karat di lidahnya. Umpatannya didengar oleh seorang pengusaha kopi, Samuel Pinker. Samuel menawarkan pekerjaan untuknya, membuat semacam pedoman mengenai cita rasa kopi. Pedoman itu selanjutnya akan dinamakan Pedoman Wallis-Pinker.Dalam menyusun pedoman itu, Robert harus berkerja bersama Emily Pinker, anak sulung Samuel Pinker. Semakin sering bertemu Emily, Robert jatuh cinta padanya. Dengan memberanikan diri, Robert melamar Emily. Ternyata Mr. Pinker meminta mahar sebesar seribu pound. Robert tidak punya uang sebanyak itu. Mr. Pinker pun mengusulkan kepada Robert untuk pergi ke Afrika dan membuka lahan perkebunan kopi miliknya di sana. Demi cintanya, Robert berangkat ke Afrika.Di Afrika, Robert mulai mengenal adat istiadat termasuk upacara meminum kopi khas Abyssinia tradisional. Dalam upacara itu, Robert melihat seorang budak wanita yang langsung memikat hatinya. Perasaan Robert berbalas. Dengan mengambil resiko, Fikre, budak wanita itu, menyelipkan sebiji kopi ke tangan Robert. Ketika seorang wanita memberikan biji kopi pada seorang pria, itu artinya dia juga memberikan cintanya pada pria itu. Biji kopi pertama diikuti oleh biji kopi \u2013 biji kopi berikutnya. Robert semakin yakin akan cintanya pada Fikre. Hasrat liar dalam dirinya membuatnya mengirimkan surat untuk membatalkan pertunangannya kepada Emily.Di London, Emily yang sedang menunggu kepulangan Robert menyibukkan dirinya dalam pergerakan politik. Emily berjuang untuk hak suara wanita dalam politik. Ketika surat pembatalan pertunangan dari Robert datang, Emily patah hati. Untungnya ada Arthur Brewer, seorang politisi yang menghiburnya. Singkat cerita, Arthur melamar Emily dan mereka menikah. Tetapi ketika Arthur kemudian menjadi seorang politik sukses di parlemen, kehidupan pernikahan mereka mulai berubah. Sembunyi-sembunyi, Emily melakukan pergerakan di bawah tanah memperjuangkan hak wanita. Hal yang tentunya bertentangan dengan kedudukan Arthur di parlemen.Membuka lahan perkebunan di Afrika bukanlah hal yang mudah. Robert harus berurusan dengan penebangan hutan, perbudakan, pemberontakan kaum pribumi, utang piutang, dan kondisi alam yang tidak ramah. Seakan belum cukup masalah yang diterima Robert, dia pun menjadi korban penipuan yang telak. Penipuan yang hampir saja membuatnya mati di Afrika, seandainya saja dia tidak ditolong oleh pekerjanya.Seperti kata pada judul aslinya, the various flavors, buku ini membahas mengenai politik, ekonomi, agronomi, humanisme, hingga percobaan medis yang berkaitan dengan orgasme dirangkai dengan apik. Dan bagi anda pencinta kopi, jangan lewatkan pengetahuan tentang aneka ragam jenis kopi di seluruh dunia yang diangkat dalam beberapa bagian buku ini. Buku ini layak untuk dikoleksi. Saya mengacungkan jempol untuk semua riset yang dilakukan oleh penulis."}, {"userName": "Abiyasha Abiyasha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1258940-abiyasha-abiyasha", "userReview": "I was a fan of Anthony Capella's The Wedding Officer and when I found this book in bookstore, I grabbed it right away.

He fancies himself a poet or writer, but isn't actually talented or motivated. To support himself, he finds employment with a coffee merchant -- tasting various coffees and finding the precise words to systematically categorize the various blends.Robert is sent on a five year journey to the coffee producing areas of the world (Africa, the Middle East) to establish plantations. This part of the book is very interesting and reads like a historical travelogue. The white man's heartless exploitation of the land and people of Africa is hard to read about, but interesting from a historical perspective. Later in the book the wheeling and dealing of major coffee merchants (trading, speculation, etc.) to drive small competitiors or tiny coffee farms out of business is explored.One of Robert's love interests is a young lady with modern ideas. There's a lot of interesting historical info on the Suffragette Movement and women struggling for equality in turn of the century London.I wish I could say I enjoyed this book more. It was interesting. The author's The Food of Love: A Novel is a 5++ star read imo -- a Cyrano de Bergac (sp?) like story, only with food -- a gem of a read, lots of humor.

It had an overall darker tone to the plot and the main character, Robert, fell victim to a series of unfortunate events. So, in that respect, it was a much sadder book, but it was also very interesting. Robert lived in England but traveled to Africa and South America, which gave the book nice changes of scene. He witnessed many events, whether they be historical, like women's suffrage, or fictional. And, I also learned a lot about coffee, that is, if this book had any historical accuracy in that respect...

But my feelings changed from almost abandoning the book to absolutely loving it.It opened up: when Robert Wallis, a regular patron at the Caf\u00e9 Royal, had a chance encounter with Samual Pinker, a wealthy coffee merchant. He had overheard Wallis criticising the coffee. It was his description of the coffee that piqued Pinker\u2019s interest. He needed someone for his business who could distinguish the various tastes of coffee and capture their elusive flavours, in words that Pinker was sure someone like Wallis could express.Pinker proposed an offer of employment, which Wallis could hardly refuse, even though it wasn\u2019t well paid. Wallis had been expelled from Oxford for failing his exams. Influenced by the indolent company he kept, he simply hadn\u2019t studied hard enough. His real interest was in writing poetry. He had been living off his father\u2019s allowance, which he spent on fine clothes and a hedonistic, decadent, lifestyle. But then his father discontinued his financial support, so Pinker\u2019s offer couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.In the beginning, I found Wallis\u2019 highfalutin language infuriating. It was so flowery and long winded, it made tedious reading. He didn\u2019t take life seriously, so he, and the book, seemed pointless.But then, Mr Pinker commissioned him to travel to a remote part of Africa, searching for the finest coffee - and to set up a coffee plantation. It was a ploy of Pinker to get Wallis out of the way: a personal reason, which is explained in the book.From the moment Wallis set off on his adventure, my opinion of the book took a dramatic u-turn. Wallis himself became thoroughly fleshed out and his character became enriched. I began to understand why he was so bland to begin with. It was purposely to gauge his development and how much he matured. I found his time in Africa so engrossing. The author\u2019s descriptions were put to awesome effect; I could visualise the scenes \u2013 my senses were virtually given a treat; I could hear the sounds and imagine the smells/aromas. In a nutshell, I was in Africa.After his experiences, Robert Wallis came home a changed man; a more principled one and one that I cared for. Gone was the shallow waste of space; instead, there was significantly more depth to him.The book included politics and I found the suffrage movement interesting. I hadn\u2019t taken an interest in the suffragettes previously, so I didn\u2019t have a full understanding of what they endured to secure the vote for women in Parliament. Thus I found it informative.I\u2019m giving the book five stars, because, although I didn\u2019t like the beginning, I felt that it more than redeemed itself. I\u2019m so glad I persevered; otherwise I would have missed out on an amazing read."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25698493-jennifer", "userReview": "This is another of those books that is probably unfair of me to rate because I would not have picked it up for myself. A friend of my mom's bought it for her because my mom likes coffee, and my mom passed it on to me because I also like coffee.On the surface, this is a work of historical fiction about a man who finds himself employed in the coffee distribution business, and it addresses British colonialism and the free market, touches briefly on slavery, and ends by focusing on the women's movement. On the surface, it sounds like a perfect blend of politics, history, and coffee.I just...wow. Wow. There are so many things about this book that turned me off. The main character is terrible; in the beginning, he admits he's terrible. He changes throughout the novel, and we're supposed to like him at the end (I think we were also supposed to like him at the beginning but just...I couldn't), and I did like him better at the end, but I still didn't enjoy reading about him.And then there were things that felt anachronistic. Not that the events were wrong for the time, but certain conversations and the narrator's commentary often took me out of the narrative. Unfortunately, these were often conversations or asides the author included to make the book sound as if it took place at the end of the 19th century - he had a habit of explaining historical events or practices, which made the effort involved in creating the time period too apparent.While this book did not fail in producing a politically charged love story that began with a business based in coffee, I did not like much about how that was accomplished.Near the end, I thought I might up my rating to two stars, and then some things happened, and it became a solidly one-star read.

Evoluzione degli eventi, dei personaggi. \u00c8 palese, ma anche credibile e gradevole, il modo in cui Robert ed Emily evolvono: lo fanno riuscendo a tirarsi via di dosso l'uno lo stereotipo del dandy dagli scarsi contenuti, l'altra quello della ragazza perbene moderatamente idealista. Robert cresce, ma lo fa mantenendo alcune debolezze e la conclusione non fa che confermare quanto poco scontata sia stata la scelta dell'autore; il personaggio evolve come potrebbe farlo chiunque di noi, senza trasformarsi o perdere di credibilit\u00e0. Cambia ma mantenendo le proprie caratteristiche. Cresce ma lo fa rimanendo, credibilmente, se stesso. A sua volta Emily ne assume di nuova, di credibilit\u00e0, abbandonando sempre pi\u00f9 l'immobilismo dei propri valori per scendere in campo ed, in campo, trovare la fine. La fine di una vera suffragetta, che sceglie di non calpestarsi e calpestare i propri principi neppure per un lieto fine che io, lettore, avrei ritenuto troppo degno di un romanzo rosa. Un po' prevedibile la conclusione con la nuova storia d'amore, ma in fondo lo si perdona all'autore in quanto questa scelta fa parte di quell'iter che rende il \"nuovo Robert\" amabilmente credibile.
