That number was no accident: Inside was a slim chapbook recounting the autobiographical tale of Koons Crooks, a programmer whose religious devotion to the tweets of the Silicon Valley elite leads him to a tragic demise.The book was an absurd, scathing sature of tech culture, and the people who received it\u2014a group that included Fusion editor Alexis Madrigal, Buzzfeed executive editor Doree Shafrir, and Mother Jones editor Clara Jeffrey\u2013were captivated. As were their Twitter followers. There were obvious questions: Was this a gimmick, an elaborate marketing ploy? A righteous indictment from someone deep within the tech industry? Who wrote this?Now, you can read the book and start sleuthing yourself. Earlier this week, FSG Originals published Iterating Grace, now available for $8 in a bookstore near you. But the author (or authors) remain anonymous, and not just to you: also to obsessive readers trying to unmask the author; and even to Sean McDonald, who edited and published the book without ever knowing who wrote it.Decoding AnonymityIn the weeks after Iterating Grace reached its initial audience, speculation ran high. Accusations of authorship flew\u2014from BuzzFeed\u2019s Jacob Bakkila to WIRED alum Tim Leong to Robin Sloan, author of Mr. Penumbra\u2019s 24-Hour Bookstore.\u201cI wish I had done it!\u201d says Sloan. \u201cIt hurts. Denying it was a little painful, because I wasn\u2019t the one with an idea this creative and vital.\u201dAfter Madrigal, Sloan\u2019s neighbor, accused him of writing Iterating Grace, he showed it to his literary agent, Sarah Burnes, and to FSG\u2019s McDonald, who didn\u2019t have high hopes for publication. \u201cI was intrigued by it, but it seemed absurd to me that we could do something with it,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cIts length, its strangeness, not knowing who wrote it\u2014it all seemed insurmountable.\u201dBut Burnes reached out to the email address listed on the original 140 copies. And as long as their anonymity was guaranteed, the authors agreed to a five-figure book deal to publish their work. According to McDonald, only one person in the contracts department at FSG Originals knows who the authors are\u2014and she\u2019s sworn to secrecy.To date, no one has been able to definitively uncover the identities of the authors, despite endless speculation\u2014which includes one extremely detailed statistical analysis on the text. For his efforts, the authors of Iterating Grace have given that particular fan a wink: The FSG print of the book is dedicated to him.Parodic Form, and ContentThe book itself is a tongue-in-cheek takedown of the blind worship of the tech elite, littered with insider references: Koons Crooks shouts commands at his dog in Unix, an operating system popular in the 1980s. He wears a fleece vest from Pixelon, a startup that went bankrupt in 2000. He\u2019s \u201cfully post-meal,\u201d surviving on frozen snack food.But by omitting their real names, the authors have taken their parody of Silicon Valley\u2019s self-adulation one step further. If published with a conventional byline, the book would still be a satire, but a reader would be engaging with the hyperbolic personal narrative of a known author\u2014which isn\u2019t very different from the VC tweets handwritten into the chapbook. (A sample: Brad Feld\u2019s \u201cReminder to self: not happy with game: change the game.\u201d)Because of the pseudonym, the reader is conscripted into a more active role of trying to puzzle out the whodunit\u2014and hopefully recognizing his or her own over-reliance on social media in the process. \u201cIf [Koons Crooks] revealed themselves, they\u2019d just be the authors of Iterating Grace,\u201d says Sloan. \u201cBy not revealing themselves, they\u2019re remaining the authors of this whole experience.\u201dAnonymity: An Unlikely Social Media ToolBefore the 1800s, authors were often anonymous. (Shakespeare\u2019s name didn\u2019t appear on any plays until 1599, seven years after Henry VI was first performed.) But in recent years, the form of anonymous writing\u2014of letting the written word speak for itself\u2014has fallen out of vogue. Contemporary authors are expected to play a role far after the book goes to print by promoting their work through public appearances and interviews, or suffer financial consequences.\u201cIt\u2019s the economics of publishing,\u201d explains Michael Reynolds, editor-in-chief of Europa Editions, which publishes the best-selling \u201cNeapolitan Novels\u201d under Elena Ferrante\u2019s pseudonym. \u201cIf you\u2019re not willing to do live interviews, to go on book tours, on TV, on the radio, then certainly at bigger publishers, that would affect the advances you\u2019re being offered.\u201dBeyond in-person promotion, authors increasingly must maintain an online presence. This works out well for some authors\u2014just look at how Shea Serrano managed to mobilize a Twitter army 40,000-strong to catapult The Rap Year Book to The New York Times Bestseller List\u2014but writers less adept at self-advertising risk obsolescence.Serrano\u2019s success came from a cult of personality, from what felt like a personal relationship with thousands of loyal fans. But Koons Crooks and Elena Ferrante suggest that the opposite approach\u2014complete anonymity\u2014offers an alternate path to literary success.Since her debut novel in 1991, Ferrante has refused to do any promotion or public appearances, insisting that her work should speak for itself. \u201cI believe that books, once they are written, have no need of their authors,\u201d she wrote in a letter to her Italian publisher. \u201cIf they have something to say, they will sooner or later find readers; if not, they won\u2019t.\u201d Let the work speak for itself.\u201cWhat does that mean for readers, when 95% of their interaction with an author is through the book?\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cBy being a successful author who has decided not to participate in promotional activities, [Ferrante] suggests another paradigm for authors\u201d\u2014an alternate route recognized when Foreign Policy Magazine named the anonymous author as one of its leading global figures. (The only other Italian on that list was the Prime Minister.)In their own way, the authors of Iterating Grace are attempting that same alternate path. \u201cThe anonymity forces the conversation to the actual text,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cThere\u2019s the mystery, but there\u2019s no cult of personality to it.\u201dExcept, of course, there is a cult of personality to Iterating Grace, as evidenced by the endless speculation and tweets and articles about who the real authors could be. But that\u2019s the point. Rather than obsession with a particular author through social media, anonymity has forced the conversation back on the readers, turning the mirror on our own fixations with innovative ideas and the individuals behind them.

Later, rumours of Crooks' strange behaviour and bizarre demise are passed around San Francisco and make their way to an anonymous editor, who pieces together the tale. In a half-hearted stab at pretending it's a true story, the whole thing is labelled as the work of 'Koons Crooks and Anonymous'. This wasn't awful or anything, just kind of pointless outside its original context. I know the backstory, but having read the 'book' (very short story), I assume there must be something more I'm not seeing, maybe references that would only make sense to the original recipients. There are a few gently satirical details, but it's just so slight; I certainly wouldn't call it 'vicious' or 'scathing' as the article that first brought it to my attention did. I really should have taken heed of the fact that people suspected Robin Sloan of being the author.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1349291-james", "userReview": "While I second the comments others have made (\"not my world\", \"obviously a marketing ploy\", among others), I believe that this work makes fun of itself in such a way that makes it truly important to the history of the technology world. It mocks the longevity of our technology (or lack thereof), it mocks the personalities that have created it, and it touches on what is (perhaps) most important:That startups are a kind of spiritual exercise. While we might debate if this is a good spiritual exercise, it has many of the hallmarks of what non-Judeo-Christian religions commonly count as such, namely:- Ineffability (inability to capture the experience in ordinary language). - Noetic quality (the notion that mystical experiences reveal an otherwisehidden or inaccessible knowledge).Those 2 are very easily met by a startup - it is impossible to capture the experience in ordinary language, or to even attempt to explain The Struggle. The experiences also reveal hidden or inaccessible knowledge - not just knowledge of the market, the products and technology, but in people. Most notably, it reveals hidden truths about yourself, your best friends (founders), and humanity as a whole.In short, if you're in tech I strongly recommend reading it.

Who is this Koons Crooks?With its privately-printed, anonymously-produced 140-copy first printing, Iterating Grace became the talk of summer 2015 in the tech world. From Buzzfeed to Tumblr to Fusion, people were puzzled and enthralled by the story of Koons Crooks, a young man who took the Twittered musings of the Silicon Valley elite to heart-and ended up on a profoundly unexpected path, leaving behind only the lovingly hand-calligraphed tweets that had meant so much to him. His story struck an immediate chord.There were competing efforts to identify the author of Iterating Grace; blog posts and lengthy comment threads pointed finger at writers all over the country, from Robin Sloan to Susan Orlean to Dave Eggers. Other early theories supposed it was the tip of an elaborate marketing scheme, and soon all would be revealed. But gradually it became clear that it was simply this: a small piece of literary art, perfectly pitched and driven by a Twain-like bemused outrage, by a creator who did not want to be identified, and would not explain anything beyond what the satirical fable said for itself.Disruptive innovators whose tweets are illustrated in Iterating Grace include: Austen Allred, cofounder of Grasswire; Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator; Marc Andreessen, coauthor of Mosaic, cofounder of Netscape and Andreessen Horowitz; Jeff Bussgang, VC at Flybrige Capital; Tony Conrad, cofounder and CEO of about.me; Benedict Evans, VC at Andreessen Horowitz; Brad Feld, VC at Foundry Group-and many more.", "title": "Iterating Grace: Heartfelt Wisdom and Disruptive Truths from Silicon Valley's Top Venture Capitalists", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28043027-iterating-grace", "average": 3.28, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1448948178l/28043027.jpg", "reviews": 52, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14074282.Koons_Crooks", "name": "Koons Crooks"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5158478.Anonymous", "name": "Anonymous"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Science", "Business"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28043027-iterating-grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26199239-iterating-grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25696427-iterating-grace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36521466-stetige-anmut---iterating-grace"]}
