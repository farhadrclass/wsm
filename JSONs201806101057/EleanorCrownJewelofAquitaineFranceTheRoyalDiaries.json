It's not the best book of the series (although I remember liking it enough to own it), but it applies because my paper is about the Middle Ages as presented in young adult literature. Expect reviews of most of the other Royal Diaries books to follow, assuming I get around to it. Through about 5th to 8th grade I was completely addicted to these books, and I'm pretty sure I read all of them except the ones that came out later in the series. So, these are sort of like the Dear America series - introducing kids to historic fiction by writing fake journals of various people from various periods - but here each diary is \"written\" by a famous woman (always royals, either by birth or eventual marriage) when she was a teenager. Simply put, these books were the shit when I was twelve. They're about princesses, which is awesome in itself, but these aren't Disney princesses. These bitches are seriously badass, and I wanted to be each and every one of them at some point."}, {"userName": "earthy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/657422-earthy", "userReview": "Not nearly as well-written or interesting as others in the series. The time period is interesting, and the events of Eleanor's real life seem perfect for a novel, but her characterization here makes her seem too frivolous and, at times, vapid, to be a particularly endearing character. Her sister is given minimal characterization, and the developing relationship between Eleanor and her \"favorite knight\" is chucked aside rather abruptly when historical fact requires her to be engaged to the soon-to-be king of France.

This book covers about a year of her life when she was 13-14, the last year before her marriage to Louis Capet.While Eleanor herself seems to obsess about trivial things - as do many people that age - there is a good amount of historical detail woven in, making their lives more approachable: the drawbacks of armor in hot sun and jewels on dancing shoes, the dangers of being an unmarried heiress or pilgrim, and even bathroom arrangements. It is Eleanor's diary, but I would have liked Petronilla to have a little more character - she just passed through, like a minor character in a play whose sole purpose is background - and Eleanor was able to dispose of her crush on a knight with not a thought after her engagement and marriage. None of it showed what a keen and shrewd mind she had, or talked about her famed beauty (or even the promise of it).I was glad to see the family tree, photos and epilogue in the back which gave more details of Eleanor's life, but they barely scratched the surface: her marriage to Henry was mentioned but not the political upheaval it caused, while Louis was portrayed as a normal youth for the time, not the monk he almost was. Her own Crusade went unmentioned, implying she was just accompanying Louis (and with no clarification of how unusual that was). But... it's a good start and a good way to get children reading about real historical figures and understanding the concerns and issues of their daily lives."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3942402-megan", "userReview": "I've been wanting to read this one for awhile. While Eleanor is not my favorite historical figure she is still very interesting. I usually find her to be exceedingly spoiled and selfish. These are not qualities I enjoy in my main characters but I liked the way Gregory wrote Eleanor wrote this book. I'm not sure how true to history it is because this is one of the first books I've read where Eleanor wasn't portrayed as being completely self-involved. I really liked that, it made her seem human and like the girls I grew up with only she is high-end aristocrat/royalty. I liked imagining her as a young girl prior to her first marriage to Henri II of France. Most of the time you only hear about her life in England but this story is set almost exclusively in Aquitaine. I love reading about her and the relationship she had with her sister Petronilla. I feel a kinship with them because my sister and I are the same way. Were weren't when we were younger but since we've gotten older she is pretty much my best friend so I know how sad Eleanor felt when she thought that Petra was going to be going to Paris with her. I feel the same when I think about moving to the coast to go to school while my sister stays here.

Well, finally Kristiana Gregory has remedied that in a book aimed at kids 8-13. The early years of Eleanor are not quite as exciting as her later years, as we learn in the Historical Note, but it was nice to see things from her perspective.I personally would have liked a little more description of daily life at the castle, but I can understand why Kristiana Gregory did not include more (it would have turned into a lecture). In Eleanor: Crown Jewel of Aquitaine we don\u2019t really see Eleanor\u2019s love of books and literature, even though she was a huge patron of the arts later in life. Still, I loved seeing the strong relationship between her and her sister that lasted into adulthood. Sadly, the book ended just when things were getting interesting, what with her marriage to Prince Louis and all.Eleanor: Crown Jewel of Aquitaine is well written and entertaining, but it\u2019s certainly one of the shorter books in the Royal Diaries series.

Taking note of the historical significance during that period, and how a young girl of her prestige and circumstance was able to cope with all the events that she must regrettably undergo without warning. Not only that but also taking into account of her love of parties, jewelries, expensive and extravagant clothes, reading and her spoiled but strong characteristics. Who says that women are fragile creatures? She was a predominantly a force to be reckoned with in a world where men are the most in number during the 12th century. It was a joy to read however she, the author, just decided abruptly that she was going to end the story between Clotaire the Strong and Eleanor.

I expected a little more creativity presented in the story than what I received. I perceived this even as a preteen, which is probably why I forgot all about Eleanor until I stumbled across it on Goodreads and was reminded of its existence. Gregory is very careful to remain true to both the diary format and the ADD mindset of a fourteen-year-old girl. As a girl, I read all of the Royal Diaries books, and I honestly don't recall any of them being quite this scatter-brained. It made it hard for me as a reader to remain engaged with the story. I remember what it was like to be a fourteen-year-old; I KNOW how hard it is to stay focused. But really, Gregory, for the sake of the story KEEP IT TOGETHER. I should have gleaned more of Eleanor's personality than I did, especially considering that it's written in her point-of-view. Eleanor seems to have been deeply religious, or at the very least, unusually pious for a young teen. Other than that, I learned nothing particularly unique about her as a person. She had few wants and worries aside from her father's safety, and was never truly rebellious - sneaking out of the castle from time to time hardly counts as rebellious behavior in my book, as I would've done the same and more. She had opinions and observations about the world around her, but they don't make for a decent read. As a result, I perceived Eleanor to be a generally uninteresting person. This is odd, considering that in the historical note at the end of the book, it is stated \"That she was headstrong and spoiled is undisputed.\" (p. 161) I didn't get that impression at all. In fact, both the epilogue and the historical note were more entertaining than the actual story. I learned more about Eleanor than I would have otherwise, and lo and behold, she's a fairly interesting historical character. Who would've thunk it? The only time Eleanor displays originality in her actions and thoughts is her rather unorthodox way of meeting her husband-to-be, Louis VII: she marches down to where the prince is camped, only to decide that she'd rather jump in the river instead. One guess on who pulls her out of the river. This is the only memorable part of the story, folks. Here's the page numbers (p. 124-126) so you can jump right to it thus avoiding all the uninteresting crap.One could make the argument that \"Oh, it's meant for kids and young teens, so it doesn't have to be quite so detailed as other historical fiction novels.\" To that I say, \"Yes it does.\" I use Marie Antoinette: Princess of Versailles, Austria-France, 1769, another Royal Diaries book, as an example. It remains true to the diary format, and yet manages to be historically accurate AND engages the reader throughout the duration of the story.It's also a kid's book. Imagine that. I realize that Marie Antoinette and Eleanor are different people from very different eras. As a result, there's more information to go off of on Marie Antoinette than there is on Eleanor, simply because of the different times they lived in. I get all that; really, I do... but I expected more from Eleanor: Crown Jewel of Aquitaine."}, {"userName": "Jinny", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4296908-jinny", "userReview": "Continuing my Royal Diaries nostalgic re-readathon, I have just finished this one on Eleanor. I actually don\u2019t even remember if I read this particular one as a kid, though as an adult now, I find myself fascinated with Eleanor of Aquitaine\u2019s life.I think this book is a great way for kids to be introduced to this princess/queen. This book focuses on Eleanor\u2019s life as a pre-teen. In this story, she is living happily with her father, the Duke of Aquitaine, and her younger sister Petra. The Duke of Aquitaine holds even more land than the King of France himself, and as the Duke has no male heirs, the lands will pass to Eleanor one day. Eleanor worries about how a lot of people seem to despise her father, especially when he decides to help Count Geoffrey of Anjou invade Normandy. When her father returns, he is a changed man, becoming more kind and spiritual, although many doubt this is a sincere change. When the Duke unexpectantly dies, Eleanor realizes she has become the most eligible bride in the country, since she is in control of so much land, and is soon to be married to Prince Louis the Younger of France.This portrayal of Eleanor is mostly made up, I think, since even the historical note at the end said the real Eleanor was said to be extravagant and spoiled, which is not really shown in this book. However, she was also said to be headstrong and carefree, which this book Eleanor certainly was. Book Eleanor was also very much a family person and adored her father and younger sister, as well as a person who was quite kind to her servants. So basically, she was portrayed in the most positive light possible, which is how all the other royalty in this book series are portrayed too. Not that that\u2019s a bad thing, exactly, but the princesses all kind of blend together since they are not really made to be unique. I guess they want to set a good example for the middle schoolers reading this book, which is understandable, and I suppose one would not notice unless one actually plans to read more than few books from this series.Characterization is basically my only complaint with this book. Other than that, I enjoyed reading this quite a bit. You get to learn the circumstances that brought Eleanor to become Queen of France, and there is also quite a lot about what life was like back in the medieval times. I knew the medieval times was a \u201cdirtier\u201d time, with ticks and bugs crawling in people\u2019s hair being a regular thing, but I was really horrified at the scene where Eleanor sees one of her servant boys throw up a mass of white worms, and a physician pulling out a long white worm the length of an arm from a girl\u2019s head! Poor medieval people, I thought!All in all, this was a pretty good book, I think a middle schooler would enjoy reading this one. It ended off at a good spot too, right when Eleanor becomes Queen, so that kids who are interested in what happened after she became Queen have a good place to start."}, {"userName": "Small Review", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4579690-small-review", "userReview": "Originally posted on Small Review blog3.5 stars.This book is gross.You know how sometimes you can read a historical fiction book and not really feel like you're IN the time period? Yeah, not this book.Hats off to Kristiana Gregory because this lady nails the historical time period despite the thoroughly modern middle grade voice used for Eleanor (complete with groan-inducing \"diary I must hide you in a clever place!\" thoughts scattered throughout the book. I swear these diary book heroines spend 1/4 of the pages talking about hiding their diary).Mostly Kristiana Gregory accomplishes this sense of \"place\" by throwing in every random bit of disgusting 12th century detail from parasitic worms to bathroom accommodations. You can also play a rousing game of 1000 Ways to Die in Old Timey Europe! because, holy cow, red shirts abounded in this book.On the plus side, all these bits of barf-inducing gore totally made me spend at least three hours on Wikipedia looking up all the historical bits Kristiana Gregory threw in (Wikipedia confirms them, btw, though I still haven't found that eye worm thing described in quite that way. Oh, and that reminds me, Ms. Gregory, mind explaining to my students why I was gagging in the library?). But, hey, what do I expect from a book set in the 1100s? Those were gross times and life was definitely cheap. So points to Kristiana Gregory for keeping it real and packing in a ton of historical details between covert diary stashings (and even managing to combine the two! Flea ridden diaries, yay!). And, ya know, I know it was a total diary gimmick, but I SO wanted Eleanor to snoop in her sister's diary. Which is to say, I was getting pretty into these characters and I'll be the first to say I'm shocked because they weren't written with that much depth, but I was still totally invested.Of course, like all these Royal Diaries books, this one ended right before the good stuff really started. But that's necessary because all the good stuff is hardly fodder for middle grade books. Still, these books serve their purpose better than I would have ever expected.Bottom linePacked with historical detail, the Royal Diaries series is an excellent way to read about the early years of great historical figures (years often skipped over in adult books).Don't expect great depth of characterization or to know the real Eleanor (or any of the historical protagonists in this series) because she's written with the voice of a modern middle grade girl (albeit one expected to do needlepoint and marry for political gain).But that's ok, because as an introduction to Eleanor's childhood and her world, this book definitely serves its purpose.

My thought on this book was that it is an awesome book to read as adventure and view of culture of her time. This story followed Joseph Campbell\u2019s hero journey and of which three out of twelve steps which are steps are one: hero\u2019s introduction into world, two: call to adventure, and six: tests, allies, and enemies.\tStep one of the hero journey is the introduction of the hero into the world. In this case the main character is Eleanor, daughter of the duke of Aquitaine. The type of world that she\u2019s in is the 1100\u2019s medieval time period. Eleanor\u2019s introduction also includes what her role was which is to take over the area of land her father rules over when it is time.\tStep two of the hero journey is the call to adventure. The problems Eleanor has in that time are numerous. At the beginning, her dad has fought with the pope over something and was still fighting. As time went on though, for some reason the dad apologizes to the pope after he clearly has major issues with him. Eleanor\u2019s only reason for her to rule after her dad relieves his position by death or something else was because her four year old brother died years ago a couple of months after her mom died from the sound of it either a stroke or a heart attack. Plus, she falls in love with a knight known as Clotaire the Strong. Back then the knights were born to peasants and a person of higher position is forbidden to marry any lower than they are. \tStep six of the hero journey is the tests, allies, and enemies. A test that Eleanor had in this story was bearing the burden of her dad going into an invasion of Normandy. Her dad was gone a lot for collecting things from the peasants from around the area that he owned and afterwards had to go help with the invasion of Normandy. Some of the allies she had were her younger sister Petronilla (Petra), her favorite knight Clotaire the Strong, and the maidens she had. Lastly, the number one enemy she had in the story was named Baron William of Lezay. He was greatly trusted by her dad to look after everything when he was gone to Normandy but he kept on messing with the maidens in inappropriate ways and even tried that on Eleanor herself. His reward for that was a hard slap on the face.\tInside this story was an awesome adventure of life for a daughter of a duke in medieval time full of interesting views of culture and society."}, {"userName": "Liralen", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4089241-liralen", "userReview": "I discovered a whole slew of these at the library the other day -- bringing back memories! I was much more into the Dear America books than the Royal Diaries books when I was in the target age range, but I remember loving the books about Elizabeth I and Cleopatra VII.This one interested me because, although I am waaay out of the age range for the series, I think Eleanor of Aquitaine was basically a BAMF (erm, excuse my language). I wanted to see what they'd done with her story here.Unfortunately, the answer is 'not much'. Part of this, I expect, is due to the target audience and the general branding of this series: it wouldn't fit to put Eleanor at even eighteen or twenty, since these books tend to be both narrated by and aimed at a younger age range. It would be similarly impractical to get into Eleanor's difficulties with Louis (and vice versa), given that they wanted a happy ending.But it's like all the interesting parts were stripped out. One of the things that makes Eleanor so interesting is that, for a woman in that time period, she had an incredible amount of power. She was, at different times, queen of France and England; she accompanied Louis VII on the Crusades; she supported her son in a rebellion against her (second) husband and was subsequently imprisoned for sixteen years, until her husband died and her son installed her as his regent. You don't achieve all that by accident. You do it by good advisors and good luck and a death grip on your wits and intelligence and calculation (and a healthy dose of ambition).The Eleanor presented here is inoffensive, and occasionally strong in her way, but she shows no real initiative or drive. In many ways she's just an average teenager mooning over this boy or that one. That may well have been true for the real-life Eleanor, but on its own it doesn't make for a terribly interesting story.My first pick for 'which two historical figures, dead or alive, would you ask to dinner?' is always Eleanor of Aquitaine -- but not this version of her."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23978004-rachel", "userReview": "The reading challenge I'm taking on. Join me!This book fulfills the challenge: \"A book set in a different country\" (France).Actual Rating: 2.5 StarsThis is a sub-par entry in the otherwise excellent The Royal Diaries Series. Written by various authors, the series imagines a fictional diary of a real female figure of royalty as a child or preteen throughout history. In this book,  Kristiana Gregory writes from the perspective of a 14 year-old Eleanor of Aquitaine.The Pros: The experience of living in 12th century France is accurately depicted. Also, Eleanor's anxiety and concern for her father's well-being helps to make her character easier to sympathize with.The Cons: Eleanor can, at times, come across as shallow and selfish. The writing also seems a bit stilted and awkward, and sometimes doesn't flow very well.Despite this less than stellar book, I would definitely recommend the rest of the series. Two of my favorites are: Kaiulani: The People's Princess, Hawaii, 1889 and Mary, Queen of Scots: Queen Without a Country, France, 1553.One of the thing this series does best is help its readers, especially the target audience of preteen girls, more easily relate to history in fun, quick reads. For those real history buffs, in the back of every book, there's a section containing a family tree, a who's who and an epilogue documenting what occurs after the events of the journal.In short, I don't particularly recommend the book, but the rest of the series is definitely worth a look."}, {"userName": "Carlyn Brody", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8851468-carlyn-brody", "userReview": "The Scholastic Royal Diary series are fictional diaries of ancient royal women when they were teenagers at an exciting point in their lives. Eleanor of Aquitaine was a real person who lived in France from 1122-1204. She was the Queen of France from 1137-1152 and later became Queen of England from 1154-1204. Eleanor was the mother of King Richard I who was also known as Richard the lionheart who is connected with the Robin Hood legend. Eleanor was the daughter of Duke William X who owned more French land than the King. When Eleanor\u2019s father died he left all his property and riches to Eleanor as he had no sons and she was his oldest child. Eleanor suddenly becomes the most eligible woman in Europe. Many men want to marry her and are even willing to kidnap her. It is a lot for a fifteen year old to handle but in the novel Eleanor is an intelligent and outspoken girl. In the novel, Eleanor spends her time in the castle longing to be free. There is a bit of intrigue and romance though which makes the novel exciting. What I liked about novel is the insight into medieval life, such as what they did for fun and daily life. I could relate to Eleanor as she was just a regular teenager. In the novel, she talks about clothes, loves to go out and have fun just in a medieval way. She also has a grandmother who forever reminds her to be a lady. The grandmother reminds me of the mother from Brave. The royal diary series includes an epilogue of what really happened to the noble woman after the story ends. I think Eleanor had an interesting life, she had two husbands, was queen of two different countries, had ten children and lived to her eighties. She had a happy life compared to some of the women featured in the royal diaries series. I enjoyed reading about Eleanor of Aquitaine.

A princess with vast lands and holdings, she lives her life in relative leisure, craving romance and passion in her daily life. Longing to model her life after the King Arthur legends, she flirts gently with her chosen knight and begs the castle minstrel to compose songs to their chivalric (and chaste) \"love\". When her father dies unexpectedly, leaving no male heir, Eleanor and her sister are confined as much as possible to the inner castle, as the local lords and barons plot to kidnap the two girls and take them as unwilling wives, in order to claim their lands as their own. Eleanor dreams of a dashing prince who will arrive to save her from the fear of being kidnapped and from the monotony of being a lonely princess. As far as the Royal Diaries go, this one is a quick, light read and very pleasant. The history here is interesting and provides a nice contrast to some of the later diaries - it is something of a shock to see the princesses living in relative isolation and danger after having read of the palatial estates of, say, Catherine the Great or Marie Antoinette.

In the novel, she has to deal with problems such as the possibility of being kidnapped and held for ransom, her father going on a pilgrimage from which he never returns, and living in physical conditions which are primitive by today's standards.It's not a nice world that she grows up in, and her problems become more complicated when she's scheduled to marry a person that ends up suddenly becoming the King of France.The historical section of the book is particularly interested. Apparently she wasn't necessarily the nicest person in the world as she was involved in various court intrigues. She was also different in that she was quite educated, a trait not common at all to girls of the time.For anyone who likes stories of knights and armor, kings and queens then this is a good book for you."}, {"userName": "Heather Gmiterek", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63434769-heather-gmiterek", "userReview": "We do Classical Conversations with my kids for school, and Kairi loves the history sentence about Eleanor of Aquitaine and her son Richard the Lionhearted. Saw this at the library and thought it would be a fun read to create a picture of life in the middle ages and bring history to life. To show that Eleanor was actually a little girl, a real person and historical fiction has a way of making history fun.This book was all about the younger years and I loved the way it described life in the middle ages. I think it gave Kairi a good picture in her mind, although it didn't go into her later life and the crusades although I think I will be hard pressed to find something age appropriate that delves into that era of her life. Kairi really wanted to hear about them fighting the Turks for Jerusalem. Perhaps on the go through classical conversations cycle 2 we will find something that goes a little more in depth that will build on what we learned this year."}, {"userName": "Mads", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/409814-mads", "userReview": "When reading the Royal Diaries series or the Dear America series, there are two authors who stick out in my mind: Kristiana Gregory and Kathryn Lasky. I find that their books are the best-written and most interesting.Gregory writes in in a way that fills the story with plot, even where there is little to say. Gregory has written some great Dear America books, including my personal favorite (The Oregon Trail diary of Hattie Campbell), and each of her books are interesting and well-written. This book would have gotten two stars, but because it was so well done it's gotten three.Thanks to my sister, who lent me this book.

I didn't feel like this was one of the better stories in this series, but was still entertaining. Eleanor was the daughter of Duke William X, granddaughter of William the Conqueror, and mother of Richard the Lionheart and King John. She was first married to Prince Louis VI, whom was more interested in attending to his hobby of locks, and reciting his prayers than he was in paying much attention to his wife. She later married Henry II, having many children in this union, including the 2 sons named above. She was a strong woman for her time and ruled as queen of 2 nations - her home country of France, and later in England.

Her father's only legitimate son died as a young child, leaving Eleanor, the oldest of his two daughters, next in line to inherit his lands, which are larger than those controlled by the King of France. Eleanor knows that because of her position, she will be married off in a strategic alliance. But what she would like is to marry for love, something that's completely impossible. Eleanor records the experiences of her life as a noble girl in Medieval France in a diary given to her by her grandmother. This was one of my favorite books in the Royal Diaries series. I especially loved the Medieval setting. I'd highly recommend this book to all Royal Diaries fans."}, {"userName": "Cara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5453326-cara", "userReview": "Thankfully, I enjoyed this book! Much better than many of the others I've read in this series.I learned a lot about Eleanor from the epilogue, which is usually the part that I enjoy most from all the books in the series and they are usually the only part worth reading as well. But I didn't know that her family owned more land than the King of France at the time. Also didn't know that she would be Queen of two countries and that she was the mother to one of the most famous English Kings in history: Richard the Lionhearted.The story was likable and more importantly, believable, because it seemed realistic that I liked that she was stubborn and strong-willed."}, {"userName": "Lucy Zheng", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3140546-lucy-zheng", "userReview": "Eleanor was a princess of france.

Their mother died several years earlier, so their grandmother and ladies-in-waiting raise the girls. Eleanor is extremely intelligent and literate, having been carefully educated by royal tutors. Spinning bores her, as does weaving, sewing, and other housewifery skills expected of her. She would rather be a knight and ride off to war.
