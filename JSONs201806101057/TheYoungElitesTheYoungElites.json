Who will ever want you, Adelina?My fury heightens. Everyone. They will cower at my feet, and I will make them bleed.\nTwo words. Fuck, yeah!I don't even know how to describe this book. Maybe William Shakespeare's Mistborn? It is not without its flaws, but the love of a book, much like the love of a human, is completely chemistry-based, and for me, this book just clicked. Every so often, the planets align, and Khanh completely loves a book. It happens!This book has so many elements that I love. A very light romance. A dark, physically-scarred main character. A beautiful (and completely platonic) friendship between the main female character and a male courtesan. A complex \"villain\". And a plot to take over the kingdom.Can I get a \"Fuck, yeah?\"The Summary: \nYou tried to escape from me, he says, but I found you. You have lost and I have won. I tell him that I\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead. I tell him to go away. But he stays.It doesn\u2019t matter, anyway. I\u2019m going to die tomorrow morning\nAdelina Amouteru is a murderer, justified. Adelina has a shitty life. She is like Cinderella, without the stepmother, but with a father like hers, who needs a wicked stepmother? There is only one word to describe daddy, and that word is motherfucking asshole. Ok, make that two words. Whatever.Anyway, it is a pretty shitty life mainly because not so long ago, this fever thing swept through her country, killing massive amounts of people, leaving the rest physically scarred. Adelina herself is not exempt. Not only that, there is the mental scarring, the stigma of being a \nmalfetto\n. Malfettos are feared, hated, shunned. Their very existence puts shame onto a family name. Adelina's family, formerly wealthy and respected, now suffers from her disgrace. Because she lived. And sadly, her fate is far better than some...there have been rumors that the malfetto are cursed, as such, they have been badly persecuted.It could be worse for Adelina, but not by much. Her dad hates her. Her sister is blissfully under her dad's thumb. And now her dad is going to sell her off to be a nasty old man's wife. What's a girl to do? Run away! And when daddy catches her and cruelly forces her hand? Kill him!\nI am Adelina Amouteru, the phantoms whispered to my father, speaking my most frightening thoughts in a chorus of voices, dripping with hatred. My hatred. I belong to no one. On this night, I swear to you that I will rise above everything you\u2019ve ever taught me. I will become a force that this world has never known. I will come into such power that none will dare hurt me again.\nAnd that, my friends, is how Adelina becomes a murderer. Totally justified. You go, girl! Way to self-defense!Only she is caught. Sadface. And she is sentenced to be executed. Even more sadface. Only at the last minute (it's always the last minute, isn't it?!) she is saved. Not that she needed much saving. I mean, look at this shit. Girl's got it under control, yo! Then she faints. Totally excusable, I mean, look at that shit. \nAnd just like that, the black clouds twist\u2014they scatter into a swarm of a million moving flecks that swirl across the sky and then dive down, down, down at the crowd. A nightmare of locusts. They descend on us with merciless efficiency, their buzzing drowning out the people\u2019s cries.\nThat takes a lot of energy. Maybe an entire package of Oreo's worth of energy. Can't blame a girl for fainting after that.Next thing Adelina knows, she wakes up in this totally plush place, handsome stranger rescuer dude is there, and he's in a Super Secret Special Society called The Young Elites. Only it's not just ANYONE. This guy, Enzo is the crown prince!\nThe word was that he had nearly died from the blood fever. He came out of it marked instead. Unfit to be heir to the throne. Enzo\u2019s older sister stripped Enzo of his crown and banished him permanently from the palace, never again to set foot near the royal family.\nKind of. Not really. That's because, he, too, is a malfetto, and since the public has been told that malfettoes are BAD EVIL NO GOOD, it would be kind of problematic to put one of those people on the throne, right? So his uncle, the King...is not fond of the prince, to put it lightly.And now the prince wants his throne back. WHAT DO??! TAKE OVER THE WORLD. Or the country, at least. Baby steps! Today, the country. Tomorrow, the universe.So the malfettoes are a potentially powerful bunch. The trouble is that malfettoes are aplenty, but only a few of them have special powers. Is Adelina one of the select ones? Yes. But can she actually control her abilities? Can she pass the Young Elites' test?The price for failure is high.\n If for some reason I can\u2019t control my abilities, they won\u2019t just cast me out of the Dagger Society. I know too much. A weak link in a world that wants us dead. That weak link could be me.If I cannot pass their tests, then they will do to me what they must have done with the boy who could not control the rain. They will kill me.\nThe Setting: I do believe the best word for this setting is plush. It has a very Renaissance Italy feel to it, and there is plenty of bling. The main character is rescued from a somewhat poor existence and boosted into the lap of luxury. The setting is oftentimes luxurious. There are secret lairs. And there are pretty pretty dresses and I DON'T EVEN CARE. I loved it all.The Characters: How do I love them? Let me count the ways. There are no heroes and heroines in this book, only anti-heroes, and I'll be damned if I didn't love them.Adelina:\nAs I stare silently back, I feel something powerful stir inside me\u2014a buried fire, subdued during childhood and long forgotten. I have lived all my life in the shadow of my father and my sister. Now that I\u2019m standing in the sun for the first time, I dare to think differently.The broken butterfly has been made whole.\nI love a strong, dark, bitter, angry character (who's not afraid to kill), and I can only describe Adelina as totally kick-ass. She has a darkness inside her that I love, and she is physically scarred, which I also love. Adelina is missing an eye. She is good-looking, but the book never makes it overwhelming. She has doubts, she has fears. She is haunted by the ghost of her own guilt.\n I do this because I love you, my father\u2019s ghost whispers. You may not understand it right now, but it is for your own good. You are a monster. I still love you. I will set you right.\nShe has worries about her own self-worth.\nThey are only good to me because they need me. Just like Enzo. Kindness with strings attached. Would they have befriended me if I were worthless?\nShe is not afraid to get revenge. Adelina is no pussy-ass weakling female character, and that is the most important thing. I also absolutely love her relationship with her sister.Enzo: \n\u201cI will take back my throne soon,\u201d Enzo whispers. \u201cAnd malfettos will no longer live in fear.\u201d\nThe man with the plan. The Boy Who Would Be King. He wants his birthright, and he'll go through anything to get it. Adelina be damned. His romance with her...is it a romance?\n\u201cShe is nothing to me,\u201d he snaps with a careless gesture of one hand. \u201cNothing more than a Dagger recruit. Just part of our plans.\u201d The ice in his voice hits me hard. Nothing more. A rip appears on my heart.\nIs it love, or manipulation? There is only one goal here. Enzo may have a noble purpose...but he is no saint. He can kill with the best of them, and don't you dare cross his friend.\nThe next morning, Inquisitors find Count Maurizio Saldana\u2019s dismembered body nailed to his front door, his mouth suspended in a scream, his corpse burned black beyond recognition.\nTeren: \nHe kneels on the floor. Lifts the whip. Holds his breath. Then he snaps the whip over his head. The blades rake deep into the flesh of his back, ripping jagged lines across his skin. He lets out a strangled gasp as pain floods him, robbing him of his breath. I am a deformed creature, he mouths silently, repeating the words he once said as a twelve-year-old boy, an Inquisitorin-training, kneeling before the sixteen-year-old Princess Giulietta.\nMad, obsessive, worshipful love. Teren is alternately a pitiful and terrifying creature. He has been in love with beautiful young queen all his life, he is utterly devoted to her. He will do anything for her, including find and destroy Adelina Amouteru, using any tactic possible, however dirty.\n\u201cYou have three days,\u201d he says in a low voice. \u201cIf you go back on your word again, I will shoot an arrow through your sister\u2019s neck and out the back of her skull. She\u2019ll be lucky if that\u2019s the first thing I do.\u201d He smiles, his teeth flashing in the night.\nTalk about evil! Talk about madness for love. Talk about a low-sense of self-worth! Enzo, the evil guard, is the \"villain,\" of this book, if it has one. He is so filled with self-loathing.Rafaelle: Probably my favorite character, to be honest. How rare is it that one finds a beautiful amale character in a platonic, true friendship with a female character. And beautiful he is. \n\nDaaaaaamn, son!\nHis hair, black and shining, drapes across one of his shoulders in a loose, silken braid. His olive skin is smooth, flawless, glowing. The faint musk of night lilies envelops him in a veil, intoxicating, promising something forbidden.\nI like him because he's pretty. I like him because he is a male courtesan. I like him because he wants a better life, and he has a kind, gentle heart. Beautiful boy!This book. Can I get a FUCK YEAH?"}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Want to know what happens when Marie Lu does darker and sexier? \nThen read this book.\nContrary to what I first believed, this book is not dystopian or post-apocalyptic, but is actually a dark fantasy set in a bleak world full of magic, complex villains and princes looking to reclaim their throne. And it's damn good.Adelina Amouteru is a survivor of a blood fever that swept through her nation when she was a child. The fever left only a few survivors and those survivors remained permanently scarred with strange markings on their bodies. But some of them were left with something else... strange abilities that made them powerful, dangerous and feared. These people are called The Young Elites. Adelina discovers her own unique abilities in unfortunate circumstances and is propelled into a world where everyone, it seems, is an enemy.I absolutely loved Adelina.\u201cI am Adelina Amouteru. I belong to no one. On this night, I swear to you that I will rise above everything you\u2019ve ever taught me. I will become a force that this world has never known. I will come into such power that none will dare hurt me again.\u201dShe's spent her whole life being abused by her father, feeling unloved and worthless. And she has a complex relationship with her sister - while she loves her dearly, she's always been jealous of the way their father was affectionate towards her. Her life moves from one hurdle to the next; when she finally unleashes the power she needs to stand up to her father, this makes her an enemy of society.Enter the Young Elites.There are so many fascinating characters in this novel. Obviously readers will love the extremely sexy (but not sexually graphic) scenes between Adelina and Enzo, the leader of the Elites, but there are many other interesting dynamics going on. I especially loved the relationship between Adeline and Raffaele; it's so rare to see a platonic relationship between a young male and female told well, particularly when the guy is described as \"beautiful\".But I think the thing I like best about this book is how no one is simply good or bad, everything is much more complicated and interesting than that. Adelina is allowed to have her own dark, twisted thoughts. She's not a hero. She's broken, selfish and even a little wicked at times:\u201cIn spite of everything, I feel a strange sense of glee.All this chaos is of my own creation.\u201dAnd every few chapters, the evil Teren is given his own perspective for several pages that gives us insight into why he behaves the way he does. I never liked him, of course, but I did feel a strange sense of sympathy for him. Aren't complex villains just one of the best things ever?So Adelina gets caught between two powerful groups of people who could each make her life hell, simply take it away from her, or hurt the sister she loves. She must learn fast, keep secrets and trust no one... it's a wild, breathless journey that had me thanking the god of literature that this is going to be a series. I can't wait to see what happens next.\u201cEveryone has darkness inside them, however hidden.\u201dBlog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Christine Riccio", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10093827-christine-riccio", "userReview": "I grew to enjoy this book! At first I was hesitant, but the darkness of the characters eventually sucked me in and I will definitely be reading book 2.

Sure, the story you're telling is kind of boring, and you had to be there to find it funny, but they're your friend or family member and you expect them to wake the fuck up and listen when you speak. But they don't, and you can't stop talking, because then you'll have to address the fact that they're not listening, and that's exactly the sort of social situation that you strive to avoid with every fibre of your being. So on you go, trekking forward, and on they go, not giving a single shit.That's what reading this book is like. The lights are on, but nobody's home.I'm not a huge purist with literature. I know I nitpick, but only because I care. That doesn't mean I expect every book to be a didactic critique of the blue-collar lifestyle told with an eloquent postmodernist flair that, in all its hipster charm, fancies itself the \"voice of the new generation\". I don't even write books like that. Books like that annoy me. Books like that are why Chuck Palahniuk annoys me.But this book is so dead inside, it's like a Republican. It has absolutely no soul. What did I say before? I said that the lights were on, but there was no one home, and that encapsulates all that is wrong with this book. Up front, it seems like it should be awesome: X-Men meets Assassin's Creed and never mind how much I fucking hate that whole \"X meets Y\" thing (it's corny as hell). It sounded interesting, and it should have been interesting, and it had all the components of an interesting thing, and yet it was just dreadful.Dreadful might be pushing it. It definitely wasn't the worst book I've read. (You ALL know what the worst book I ever read was.) But it's not that I think any emotion went into writing it, and it's not like I feel as though the author even cared about her own characters, or the story she was telling. This book is like a big dead goose hanging over my bookcase. It's like the author just scribbled it down one bored Saturday afternoon, threw it at her editor with a sigh and said, \"Okay, sure. Whatever. Publish it. I don't really care.\" But it's not appalling. It didn't make me rage. It didn't make me want to kick a hole through the wall with my righteous female anger.It's still awful, though. We have this asshole main character and her dick of a love interest, and then his sister Cersei Lannister who's banging Paul Bettany from Angels and Demons. There's Snow White who talks to animals and stuff, and then this dude whose powers are so vague and barely explained - no, actually, there are two of those dudes, one of them is a \"consort\" (I think you mean \"courtesan\") and the other is the typical Doubting Thomas who gets his comeuppance in the end anyway. We all know the premise: blood fever, strange markings and powers, secret society gathers together underground and tries to overthrow the prejudiced government that's killing off the X-Men. Oh, and it's all set in old-timey Italy. No, it's not \"Kenettra\" because, besides the random flying manta rays and three moons (strange moons! How original!) there is nothing that isn't lifted straight out of Renaissance Italy. It's fine to structure your high fantasy world around human history, and that can actually be ingeniously done. In fact, I welcome it. But this isn't creative. It's alternate history. And that's okay, but call it that. Don't give me alternate history and slap a high fantasy label on it. That's just dishonest.The biggest thing people will tell you about this book is that it's all about grey areas and the story of a villain, which is false, because it's abundantly clear who we're supposed to sympathize with and who we're supposed to hate, and we are not supposed to hate our protagonist, Adelina. I did, unfortunately, because she's not only as thick as two short planks, but she's a total dick about it. And she's not a dick in a complex character sort of way, in the way that makes her a grey area. She's just an unlikeable asshole. As in, I didn't care. And that's not how you create a grey area character. Look at Loki, or Tyrion Lannister, or Rick Grimes. They all do some questionable shit, but we care about them so damn much, and it's weird, because why? That's the essence of good writing. When you adore a character who does unsavoury things, and you're torn between knowing that what they've done is wrong...and that you love them anyway. Loki is the best example by far. He's a fucking dick and he does some truly awful, terrible, horrible shit, but he's so popular because he was written well. Making a grey-area character is less about making the character question themselves and more about making the audience question themselves. Don't expect this sort of complexity from Adelina. She's weak and boring and incredibly irritating, constantly weeping over all of the \"dark\" things she has done, even though everything bad she ever did wasn't her fault. She's actually completely innocent, which cheats this whole moral ambiguity line we've been fed. It was like when Katniss only killed the bad guys in the arena. The folks in the book will kick up a stink about their \"humanity\" and some such nonsense, but we as readers can see that there's nothing that dark about the whole thing. We're not questioning the characters or ourselves, because we're not being forced to.Of course, everyone goes on and on and on and on and on about this \"darkness\" inside Adelina and it's all just garbage. Adelina will think, \"I fantasize over killing people\" and then when someone accidentally dies (there are so many accidental deaths in this book that it's sort of ridiculous) she feels like shit and we know it totally wasn't her fault. I just feel that it's like Shadow and Bone, where the characters seem really deep and multifaceted and actually they're not at all. It's just good marketing.The writing was okay, but devoid of feeling. Someone took a Bissel and just vacuumed the soul right out from between these incredibly expensive pages. I paid $25 for this shit, and look what I got. I got a rainy day and a Monday. That's no fun for anyone. Honestly, this book really disappointed me. It was not a book that I expected to hate. I didn't go in hoping not to like it. I didn't go in looking for snark fodder. I genuinely and whole-heartedly wanted to, and tried to, love this book. But it was entirely unlovable.

Just with this you know it's going to be EPIC!!!These here are her actual drawings for the characters!!!If it's even half as cool as these pictures it will be the best book ever! Let's hope it lives up to them!More Pictures here: Young Elite Inspiration Picture!!!!!! UPDATE!Now it has a cover!For some reason I expected something cooler. After all the cool pictures and concept of the story I expected something so much more colorful and just plain better. I hope they change it.AFTER READINGThis was a very interesting book to read after reading Vicious by V.E. Schwab. Both are actually pretty similar. Both are filled with anti-heroes in search for redemption and revenge. The characters are hurt and they want to hurt. Many have been betrayed and many have betrayed. Everyone has their own morally ambiguous motives and everyone is determined to achieve their sometimes destructive goals. Just like Vicious this book follows the lives of super powered characters. They are not your regular super powers as one might see in super heroes. These powers were acquired through death and sickness. These powers are unnatural and ungodly. At least that is what some say. Others believe these powers to be god sent. Also like Vicious there are characters that fill certain spots. The man looking to kill them all, believing himself to be holy. They even have the exact same power and that is Eli in Vicious and Teren in TYE. There is also the person looking to claim his revenge. In Vicious it is Victor while in TYE it is almost everyone. Still, in spite of the similarities I did manage to look at the two as very different books. TYE takes place in a renaissance/ medieval-ish world. Ten years ago there was a plague that killed every adult infected. The children who were infected lived but came out twisted and marked. A few among them even came out with supernatural abilities that do not belong to the world of man. Now those with powers, called the young elites, are being hunted down and killed. They are also doing some hunting and killing of their own trying to dethrone the king of Kenettra so a new age of Elites can rule. Mixed in the middle of all of this is Adelina a girl who has been abused and used her whole life. Now with her new found ability and Young Elite status she is out for vengeance. With darkness in her soul she will do whatever it takes to make sure that she is not the one that gets hurt anymore. That she is not the one that gets used. She vows to destroy anyone who has ever harmed her and take down anyone that dares to stand in her way. The book was filled with interesting characters that I see as having a lot of potential. Great things can come in the future of those characters and I cannot wait to see how they all turn out. It is possible that my enjoyment of the story was affected by my reading of Vicious and the distracted way in which I read the book. Still, I think that great things will come from this story.

She's such a strong heroine. The kind we just love to have in our fantasy reads. It\u2019s pretty crazy, to say, how easily she and I clicked. Turns out, even though I don\u2019t believe myself to enjoy or, sometimes, want to hurt people, we have many things in common, such as fighting for what is dear to us, family and always trying our best.Enzo is the love-interest of Adelina. He is the rightful heir to the throne, but was banned, since he is a malfetto and malfettos are feared and, even, in some other places killed. Just because they\u2019re different from others. They may not be \u2018evil\u2019 but, to the eyes of others, they very likely are since they are usually flawed and have unique powers. Enzo is the head of the Young Elites which is a secret sect of malfettos who are organizing\u2026something big. They want to make of Enzo the ruler of the Kingdom. Which is fantastic. I think it to be a great idea\u2026except that there wasn\u2019t much they actually did to achieve their goal.In fact, there wasn\u2019t that much happening in the story. It mostly revolves around Adelina who became a spy, in order to free her sister, Violetta, from the hands of Teren, someone who despises malfettos. I do understand why Adelina decided to agree to Teren\u2019s terms for the freedom of her dear sister, but I think the whole concept and situation was too simple, in a way. There was a lot lot lot of potential but it feels, to me, like the author somehow decided to take the easiest path, because of how she \u2018handled\u2019 everything that happened. No scenes that will blow your mind.Other than that, I did enjoy this, really. I wasn\u2019t that disappointed, since I did not have very high expectations, being one of the few who were not mesmerized by the \u2018awesomeness\u2019 (as many say) of the Legend trilogy. I enjoyed it, same as this one, but nothing more\u2026There was almost no romance. A little, but this is definitely not driven by romance. When it was present though, I was hooked and hold my breath at how captivating it was. But, like I said, there\u2019s isn\u2019t much of it. What a shame.The writing was good and pleasant enough to read. I did think that the world-building wasn\u2019t as developed as there was possibility to be though. The author did a great job at creating unforgettable characters but, in my opinion, she kind of neglected the world-building. There is some of it, of course, but you can see how the characters are more important compared to it.When I think about how the author switched from dystopian (with Legend) to fantasy, (with this) I think she overall proved that she can create a story, whatever the genre will be. And that\u2019s fantastic! Bravo to her! Would love to see if she pulls contemporary off. I think she could.I would recommend this to fantasy fans out there. Be warned, though, it is very different from her well-known trilogy. You may see similarities to characters but, other than that, it\u2019s completely different. It was a good read, some scenes were dragging here and there or having too much of Adelina\u2019s internal struggles but it was engaging enough and the magic interesting.PS. Am I the only one who thinks the cover is a little\u2026cheap? Giving the impression that the design as a whole is only half finished?

So, you know, fellow minority readers - I hope it will be the same for you^^\u25ba My review of book 2 : The Rose Society \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nHey YOU! BOOK! You pretended to be right up my alley! You said I will love you! You said you were dark and captivating! The truth is, after getting off to a flying start, the tension loosened more and more, making the next 300 pages a real core to read for me. When I first met Adelina, I was ecstatic : because of the darkness that seemed to lie in her heart, she appeared to be the kind of morally ambiguous character I could root for. Too bad the whole book turned out to be completely anticlimactic : I. WAS. BORED. \u2718 I don't like Mari Lu's writing : I wouldn't be able to point what was wrong, exactly, but I kept feeling that something wasn't quite right with it. Frankly, I think that the present tense throws me off guard. And her sentences seemed... weird to me sometimes, bugging me so much that I had to reread them. It didn't flow smoothly. Not in my opinion anyway.\u2718 Let's forget the fact that there's barely any world-building, except a re-creation of the Renaissance Italy with the black plague as an explication to the Young Elites new powers. Frankly, I'm okay with authors using real settings to create their fantasy world (take Mark Lawrence for example, whose Broken Empire is nothing more than Europe after an atomic war). However, if Mark Lawrence plays with this real background, letting the reader know where his inspiration lies, Mari Lu merely uses entire settings without never acknowledging what she borrowed. Changing names isn't enough. Is it high fantasy? No. It's alternate history with fantastic elements. \u2718 The pacing was uneven a big fail : after a strong beginning which put my feelings all over the place, nothing really happens during several chapters.... until we start a new cycle again : an amazing scene and then boring pages during which I don't really know what to think. Like, the consort pages. What's the point? While I desperately wanted to feel something, to feel captivated, I was drowned in descriptions of clothes and other useless details. For real, how many times do I have to read the word velvet? Huh? Take Gabriele I meant Raphaele, and yes, I can confuse a character's name AND having read the book. Please. Don't be ridiculous. for example. I don't need to know everything he's wearing every day. Call me shallow, but I don't care.\u2718 This book is... putdownable. Is that a thing? (apparently, no, but I'll make it a thing, because I can) Indeed I kept feeling distracted during my read and before I could think more about it I was doing something else entirely (laundry, watching TV, just name it). As far as my investment in the story is concerned, it's a big huge fail for me.\u2718 But my biggest disappointment is Adelina. I expected dark. I expected complex. That's absolutely not what I got. Let's get this straight : I love antiheroes. I have no problem to adore characters who are complete little shit and who embrace evil as a living. I crave them, for crying out loud, because good (haha) antiheroes are rare and complicated to create : how to make the readers root for a character whose actions disgust and disturb them? I have no clue, but when it's well-done, it's amazing. Adelina... wasn't quite like that. She is NOT an antihero but spends her time whining about events that aren't even her fault. Okay, okaaaay, she thinks about killing people and keeps telling us that there's a darkness inside her but frankly? BRING IT, GIRL. Stop whining and show me that there's more to you than your internal confusion. I was ready to accept EVERYTHING from her : jealousy, selfishness, murder instincts, betrayal, everything. What I got is a lot of TELLING but not near enough SHOWING to make me care about her. I didn't. And you know what happens when I don't care about the characters?It becomes a core to finish. \u2718 I didn't feel anything towards Enzo as well except during his first apparition (what? I'm an Assassin's Creed whore and my eyes sparkle at the mention of daggers, don't mind me). \u2718 To be frank, during most of the book I got the impression that the characters were... wandering... to go.... somewhere... I think... It lacked directions and the plot was almost non-existent, except for the betrayal trope I see in every Fantasy YA book I read these days. Look, it was a trope I used to love, and I still do, when it's executed properly, when it's more than an easy way to bring angst in a story. Sadly, in my opinion it belonged to the second category : I simply COULDN'T FEEL Adelina's struggles. Oh, she tells us. Well, she tells us a lot of things. But to me neither Teren nor Violetta felt like real characters, therefore I was never moved by this situation. Heavy sigh.\u2714 The ending, though? It was good. It was everything I wanted from the book. It came... too late. How am I supposed to savor epic scenes if I haven't given a fuck about the characters for pages and pages? Why using most of the book as a set-up for a shocking ending? It feels just... cheap to me. A genuinely great ending won't make me forget that I was bored to death during 300 pages. Nope. Sorry.This book didn't quite give me what it was telling me.

I couldn't put this down ?? I'm so happy ??everything about it is just .... amazing. the story, the complex characters, the world, the plot, the action, THE FACT IT'S A VILLAINS JOURNEY !!! the anti-hero's and general greyness of the characters, PLOT TWISTS, oh and it's super diverse and aaaaaaaaaaahhhIM SO SHOOK I AM REELING FROM THAT ENDING I NEED THE NEXT BOOK .. IMMEDIATELY !!~ ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~ ~ ~DAYS have passed since I wrote this mess of a post-reading review on this book and my thoughts have not changed !!. I'm still so shookSince 2017 began I haven't loved anything I read. I mean it was okay, but there were no books which made my heart rush, which had me DYING to know the end. This book did. I was doing that thing where you peek at the end of the chapter because you must know (anD THEN SPOIL YOURSELF), and I stayed up sooo late to finish it. It was so damn exciting, I was completely hooked on this book, seriously, un-put-down-able. I mean ? How could it not be. Kids with superpowers ? Check. Unstable government that must be overthrown by the rebellion ? Check. A squad of friends ? Check. A cast of anti-hero's who do bad things for the ''greater good'' ? Check. I WAS BOUND TO LOVE IT. \n\u201cI am tired of being used, hurt, and cast aside. It is my turn to use. My turn to hurt.\u201d\nNOTE ABOUT THIS BOOK: absolutely none of these characters are good people. Even the ones I thought were decent turned out to be shit. there some serious villainous mfs over here. The characters were the absolute highlight !! Each was incredible complex and nuanced, each was built up on those murky grey lines, every single character had aspects of their personality that made them the anti-hero, but every single one thought themselves the hero. I adored this characterisation, on a character level but also as a depiction of humanity. We aren't all good or all bad, we're all somewhere in the middle. The beautiful thing about this villainy though is that it isn't in your face - it's perfectly, gorgeously subtle. It's just a lie here and there, it's people pretending and hiding their true thoughts, it's gently befriending someone just to use them. The thing that had me so SHOOK was even I was convinced, even me, who got to see from multiple points of view thought some things that turned out to be fake were real. I was also caught up in the lies and the manipulation. I LOVED that the main character is a girl who just got pushed a little too far. A girl who's been abused and manipulated and shunned and who is now getting back, who's rising above it, who's been turned hard and cruel by the world. Adelina is an incredible interesting character with many nuances and complexities AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER TO RISE IN THE ROSE SOCIETY. \n\u201cI hereby pledge to serve the Dagger Society, to strike fear into the hearts of those who rule Kenettra, to take by death what belong to us, and to make the power of our Elites known to every man, woman, and child. Should I break my vow, let the dagger take from me what I took from the dagger.\u201d \n \nOther good points\n SUCH. GOOD. REPRESENTATION !!!!!Many, many people of colour !!!!! lgbt rep !!!!! characters with physical flaws which they use to their advantage !!!!! Soo twisty turny, !! never guessed where it was going next and reveals and plot points which genuinely shocked me. good romance !! not too much of it but an interesting romance and one which, like the characters, is complex, built upon ambition and lust for power (perhaps) more then love. AWESOME super powers !! I'm always like, super powers are boring sometimes because there's no diversity in the powers but nooo I really liked these ones ! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~Honestly, this book was just super intense and fun !! Gave me lots of six of crows vibes and overrall was just really good.

But after reading the first 50 pages or so, I DNFed it because I was completely creeped out by Adelina's one eye malfetto flaw. XD Plus, I honestly couldn't get into the story. As The Young Elites became more popular, everyone praised this book and series to no end. Everyone was excited over The Rose Society and I was indifferent because I never really liked the first book.But after seeing the cover for The Midnight Star, I just knew that I had give this series another try. Now here I am jumping onto The Young Elites bandwagon and praising this book like there's no tomorrow. :PI absolutely loved the concept of The Young Elites and the different powers and abilities that each Elite has. I am so intrigued by Adelina and her thirst for power. I really enjoy peeking into the mind of a much darker character that comes off as a villain. I understand Adelina's anger and her reasons for doing what she has to do. I'm curious as to how this character turns out in the end and whether or not her thirst for vengeance will make her rise to the top or bring about her downfall.Violetta turned out to be my favorite character in this book along with Raffaele! Violetta came off as helpless and cowardly to me in the beginning but after finding out about the truth, my whole opinion of her changed. I really can't wait to see more of her hopefully in the next book. And as for Raffaele, I love everything about him and I'm honestly glad that he's the new leader of the Daggers members.Overall, I'm disappointed in myself for putting this book down too soon because I missed out on such a great storyline of intriguing characters!

Reading this made me feel like I was in a world that was already familiar, but then she'd sweep the rug out from underneath me and change things completely!

She is marked in more ways than one\u2013 she lost her eye to the virus, and her hair turned shock white. I love that Adelina is a flawed protagonist, not just because she lacks stereotypical beauty, but because she has a darkness inside of her that almost makes her an anti-hero. We want her to succeed even when her motives are questionable, because know society's flagrant disrespect and her father's abuse are what makes her vengeful\u2013 and when she learns that she has powers inside of her that can wreak havoc on the world that has spurned her, we find ourselves afraid for her and for the world itself if she succeeds.THE YOUNG ELITES felt both epic in scope (a grand conspiracy, a secret society of warriors, a leader with a hidden secret) but full of specific, almost poetic detail.

The blood fever took Adelina's left eye, turned her hair silver, and gave her a power that's remained dormant--until the fateful night her merchant father agrees to trade her to a suitor in exchange for cleared debts. Adelina runs away from home, and once her father catches up with her, she taps into a great hatred within and conjures forth phantoms that quickly cause his death. It was an accident, but the Inquisitors arrest Adelina and sentence her to burn at the stake--a common punishment for malfettos--for the murder of her father.Master Teren Santoro, the 19-year-old Lead Inquisitor of Kenettra, works to cleanse the world of malfettos with \"demon\" abilities. When it comes time to burn Adelina in the central market square, Enzo Valenciano, a malfetto known widely as The Reaper, melts her shackles with his burning touch and releases her. He takes her to Estenzia, the northern port capital, where Enzo introduces Adelina to the world of the Dagger Society--a group of Young Elites with dangerous powers--and their mission to find malfettos like themselves before the Inquisition can. Adelina must pass a series of tests before she can undertake bigger missions with the other six Young Elites who can control their talents, and it's here with the Dagger Society that she discovers her ability to conjure illusions is rooted in darkness. But when Teren Santoro takes her younger sister hostage in exchange for information on the identities, location and plans of the Young Elites, Adelina is compelled to betray them, even if it means leaving the undiscovered malfettos all over the world prey to the Inquisitors, and risking her own death as punishment at the hands of the Elites.In Lu's compelling new novel, the characters are morally complex (the Young Elites are not fully innocent, there are depths to Adelina's darkness and layers to the cross Teren bears)--and no one is safe in the book's final conflict. What at first appears to be romance-lite unfolds in tricky and interesting ways. The many twists, cinematic battles and the overriding epic fantasy will keep readers hooked for book two, which teases to be quite the game-changer.

This is what I want to say about my expereince with this shocking Young Elites series. I am being in awe right now for Lu. I can't believe that she wrote such an amazing story like this among many typical YA books out there. She didn't even try to make her story feel good for everyone.

To be honest, I didn't enjoy some parts of this book because it was clich\u00e9 and it would have been better if it had been cut out.

The ending saves it all, I like the way Lu introduced me to a new character and made me look forward to the next installment. The world I've seen in this book is just the tip of the iceberg, the path Adelina chooses at the end will lead her to somewhere I can't predict, and I'm so lucky that I bought the whole series, otherwise I'll be suffering now.Oh I almost forgot to say this, I have one little problem with Adelina, her voice when she narrates the story is flat, I felt no emotions in it at all.

Always mistreated, mistrusted and hated Adelina lives a horrible life with her father and sister. He hates her because she is a malfetto, a survivor of the blood fever left with a marking on her face - the loss of an eye - and silver hair. And malfettos bring bad luck. Day per day she is treated badly and her thoughts are unkind to herself until darkness fills her up. Until one night her father does something horrible and Adelina runs away. Adelina thinks she is alone, but that\u2019s not true. There are others like her, other Malfettos left with markings and powers. They\u2019re called the Young Elite and they\u2019re here to bring chaos and justice.I loved loved loved this story. There was so much action, darkness and affection. There was betrayal and love and fear. I was immediately sucked into the story. It was so interesting and addictive. Characters \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fI\u2019m always very much in love with the \u201ebad\u201c characters in nearly every story. They always turn out to be the most interesting ones. In this story that even applied to our main character Adelina. She was really insecure in the beginning, filled with fear and the feeling of helplessness. But when her powers start to appear and she learns to control them a bit she becomes more confident, strong and badass. The more her character grew, the more I fell in love with her. She was such an interesting and entertaining character. And her look - it was so awesome! Silver hair and just one eyes plus marking? That\u2019s such a really special look. Definitely a nice change to the always perfect main characters in other stories. Next to Adelina there\u2019s Teren who\u2019s probably a crazy masochist with crazy fanatic thoughts. He is so so violent and really really weird. I didn\u2019t like him (even though he\u2019s kind of the villain in the story?), but I felt like he was still created perfectly fitting for the role in this series. Enzo is another main character I liked, but not like I loved Adelina. He was a really silent and serious character, only a few words and conversations escaped him, but he had something appealing about him. He seemed like a lost man trying to fight his way back. I really liked that about him. World \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThis book is filled with perfect world building in my opinion. It was filled with a problematic reign and hungry citizens in the streets. It was filled with young people called malfettos being mistreated and killed. And a group of them who wants to fight back, to regain control. The country seemed inspired by Italy a bit, but had also own additions. The thing I love the most about the story was the powers the malfettos gained after their fell ill with the blood fever. There was fire, wind, control over fire, over things and sounds. And there were also illusions, that mixed with the reality so well. There was the darkness in Adelina that fed her powers and made her stronger and more dangerous. All in all I loved the world building in this one and the Epilogue made me want to read the rest of the series immediately. Relationships \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fThere was a tension between two characters in this story and I felt it from the beginning. In some way it was really predictable, but it was still sweet and lit up the darkness of the whole story a bit. Reading about them made me smile, because finally, finally Adelina got some love, something that wasn\u2019t filled with darkness, fear or hate. Something nice. But there were always Adelina\u2019s insecure thoughts, the whispers of her father in her ear that made her be suspicious and so so sad. Writing style \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fI really fell in love with Marie Lus writing with this book.

Familiar with Marie Lu's style and a die-hard fan of the Legend series, I thought this new story will be along the same lines as Lu's prior works: action-packed, romantic, funny -- you know the drill. Only set in a fantasy world, of course, but nonetheless still cute on a basic level. That... Was a mistake, because The Young Elites is so far from cute you cannot imagine. Eons away from cute. Zero cuteness. \n\u201cA newborn babe takes its first breath / and creates a storm that rains down death.\u201d\nYou wanna know how TYE truly is? It's edgy. It's dark. Thrilling. Awfully intense. Depression-inducing. Dare I say it, even sexy -- in no way romantic. But, most important of all, it's different and realistic in terms of characters. For once in my lifetime as a book addict, the book I read follows a heroine that has such great potential, but one that will inevitably step into the darkness. Meet Adelina Amouteru, a 16 year old girl that survived the fever which decimated the population. There were no adult survivors and the children that were affected ended up gaining unusual marks -- and some even dangerous powers. They were called malfettos and hated by most people, being treated as the gods' abominations and associated with bad fortune. That's another aspect I loved: the fact that the \"special\" ones aren't treated as kings and queens like in most books. They're cursed and killed without a second thought and it all makes for a fresh change in the sea of ever-glorifying the gifted characters (see Victoria Aveyard's Red Queen, Leigh Bardugo's The Grisha Trilogy and Josephine Angelini\u2019s Trial by Fire). \n\n\u201cThe gods gave us powers, Adelina, because we are born to rule.\u201d\nBack to our main character. Adelina has no apparent powers until she triggers them on a fateful night, trying to escape her father and accidently killing him. She discovers she has the power of illusion and that she could very well be considered a young elite \u2013 a malfetto with abilities. In spite of fleeing her father\u2019s estate, she is captured by the Inquisition Axis, the \u201cpolice force\u201d of this world, and is awaiting to be executed, only to be saved at the last moment (I know, I know) by a group of elites lead by an infamous malfetto \u2013 The Reaper. Adelina is taken under their wing and she finally finds out more about her inheritance, her limits and her saviors. \nIt might seem strange for you, especially if you read this book, but I completely loved Adelina and I sort of\u2026 clicked with her. She\u2019s so ambitious and stubborn and I admired her desire for revenge, even if her decisions weren\u2019t always the best. Forced to betray a lot of those close to her heart and abandoned in the end as well, she delves in a world of darkness and self-destruction that could\u2019ve been avoyded if only someone had paid more attention to her insecurities. I actually cried a couple of times for the things she had to go through, because the heartbreak she must\u2019ve constantly felt was saddening to no end. \n\u201cBe true to yourself, Violetta once told me when I was trying in vain to win Father over. But that\u2019s something everyone says and no one means. No one wants you to be yourself. They want you to be the version of yourself that they like.\u201d\n\nShe truly cared about The Dagger Society \u2013 the bunch of young elites that saved her \u2013 and she was able to create wonderful altough fragile friendships with some of them. Unfortunately, the losses, the unimaginable power awaiting at the top of her fingers, the self-loathing and the deep fear of never belonging will take their toll on her. Add those to the overwhelming pull to hate and fear and her dark past when she met no acceptance and you\u2019ll create a lonely, broken, desperate monster. She\u2019s the Darkling\u2019s female version and she\u2019ll become a true and great villain -- her transformation will be amazing to watch (damn, I sound evil). \n\u201cIt is my turn to use. My turn to hurt.My turn.\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d I say. My voice emerges flat and cold. The voice of someone new. \u201cBy not killing me now.\u201d\nMoving on from our anti-heroine, the rest of this literary cast is as mesmerizing as Adelina. No one is innocent, no one is honest and everyone has their own dark secrets. Firstly, The Reaper, aka Enzo. I adored him. It might have been for his emo personality and his overall badassery or for the fact that he\u2019s pretty bruised up on the inside, but Enzo\u2019s strong and intense existence won me over. Also, he might as well be the only one that put his faith in Adelina. Plus, he\u2019s quite smoking hot \u2013 literally and not literally. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he says, his voice firm. \u201cYou are stronger than that.\u201d\nThen there\u2019s Rafaelle, a courtesan who became Adelina\u2019s best friend, but who didn\u2019t return the feeling as honestly. I wasn\u2019t exactly his fan, contrary to the fact that his character combined seduction, loyalty (for Enzo) and a cunning mind. He would\u2019ve been perfect if not for his double-faced behaviour that helped Adelina\u2019s downfall from humanity. \nTeren Santoro, the most intriguing character of all. Hypocrite, manipulated and a na\u00efve lovesick puppy, he\u2019s the leader of the Inquisition Axis and the one in charge to capture her back. His hate for malfettos of any kind runs deep and he resembles a madman, ready to do whatever it is in his power to bring them all down, especially the young elites. But Teren\u2019s not exactly a villain, nor is he an innocent puppet. He\u2019s a combination of the two and when you find out his background and how he ended up being so hateful, you cannot help pity him. I seriously hope he\u2019ll realise his worth in the next installments. Adelina\u2019s sister, Violetta, was a big surprise and I was glad she was on Adelina\u2019s side, despite the few big secrets she kept hidden. The rest of The Dagger Society\u2019s members \u2013 Gemma, Michel, Lucent, Spider \u2013 were interesting and I would\u2019ve liked to know them better. Oh, and I hated the Queen. \nOne of my friends, upon reading the synopsis, decided TYE is sort of like Shatter Me with a fantasy twist. I guess you could say that. I guess you could also say that it's a bit similar to Shadow & Bone. Or, as I did, you could get The Winner's Curse vibes for no reason at all -- I still don't know what triggered them. What I'm trying to say is that Marie Lu created a story that, if dissected, would probably ring a bell with tons of other famous fantasy books, but if analyzed as a whole, then you cannot help calling it an original idea. It's bits and pieces that trigger a small deja-vu, but the fact that the author managed to put them head to head and develop them with her own brilliant ideas only increased my love for this women's talent.\n\u201cWhen the world was young, the gods and goddesses birthed the angels, Joy and Greed, Beauty and Empathy and Sorrow, Fear and Fury, sparks of humanity. To feel emotion, therefore, to be human, is to be a child of the gods.\u201d\n\nMarie Lu deserves a standing ovation for another gorgeously-written novel. While Legend will always have a special place in my heart, TYE brings a mean game as a last effort to change my 2014's best reads hierarchy -- and I think it succeeded in entering my top 5 from this year. Nothing is flawless, so I do have some minor complaints. Firstly, the world-building isn't exactly the main element of the story and I would've loved to see it a bit extended. On the other hand, I have a feeling my wish will come true in the next installments. Secondly, as much as I'd like to overlook its existence, some predictability was present in the plot. Still, it did not interfere with my overall enjoyment of the book. Let's talk a bit about the last third of the book that was, hands-down, the best part of the entire novel. It was the climatic ending I was hoping for, full of sacrifice, loss, humanity and power. I honestly didn't think that the author would take such a risky path, but I guess it was a success considering Adelina's villainess only increased -- despite my very very broken heart. \nAnyway, I want the sequel. Or maybe I want a re-written version of this one. No no no, I still have hope that Lu will sew my broken heart back. Somehow. If not, I'm gonna curse that freaking epilogue to the moon and back, because that last pages filled my heart with hope and excitement, but weariness as well. Also, I realized that Adelina's story is just a small part of the malfettos' universe and I can't wait to discover it all. *bring on the awesomeness* This book completely and utterly wrecked me and I'm half excited to continue my journey with Adelina, and half scared to experience the same level of anguish and sadness all over again. All I know is there is still a lot -- like A LOT -- of time until I get my hands on the next volume. \n\n\u201cTo love is to be afraid. You are frightened, deathly terrified, that something will happen to those you love. Think of the possibilities. Does your heart clench with each thought? That, my friend, is love. And love enslaves us all, for you cannot have love without fear.\u201d\nFrom the Italian spin on world-building, to the constant rush, overwhelming feelings and original characters, The Young Elites blew away my expectations and delivered a story I honestly fell in love with. Not exactly perfect, but amazing in its own way. It was badass, it was gruesome, it was violent and it was the foundation for a new hit trilogy. My dark self was joyous at such a compelling read. Verdict? I loved it and I recommend you grab it next time you're at a bookstore.

I've been in some kind of readers' slump these days, but then I discovered this book and BOOOM I'm back om track baby!I've felt so many emotions while reading this. I really felt Adelina's pain and loneliness. I felt happy when she was happy and was scared when she was scared. And that ending... oh the tearssss! I never expected and ending like that to be honest, it left me heartbroken and I still haven't fully processed everything that happened, but I loved everything about this book anyway and I wouldn't change a thing! I'm sure everything will turn out okay for everyone in the end.This was just such an emotional rollercoaster, involving just the right ratio of action and adventure.I loved every single character. Adelina was a really refreshing heroine. She isn't your typical goody two-shoes at all. She could fend for herself and I loved that she had some darkness in her, it makes her different from every other female lead I've encountered. Everyone betrayed her but she's still going strong! Enzo was absolutely lovely as well. He also had a dark side, which made him perfect for Adelina in my opinion, and he became yet another one of my book boyfriends in no time! Violetta seemed like the perfect little sister at first, but she also became pretty badass in the end and I loved it. The rest of the Dagger Society's members were all different and likable as well. I can't wait to know more about them and I hope they'll still play a huge role in the next book.And Teren, oh Teren... I'm still conflicted about him. I do like him, but up till now he just seems to be the Queen's doormat. I hope he'll turn out to be something more in the end!Marie Lu has quickly become one of my favorite authors ever. After reading the Legend series first, and now this one, she can really do no wrong in my opinion. Whatever book she'll release next, I'm gonna read it anyway!I can't wait to start reading the next book because I can't wait to see how Adelina's adventure continues!"}], "description": "I am tired of being used, hurt, and cast aside.Adelina Amouteru is a survivor of the blood fever.
