Is what I thought when I first heard about this retelling. However, it worked nicely into this book. Jack has a twin sister and her name is Gen and she helps quite a bit in the success of her brother. I like it that Gen isn't one of those who seek out adventure. A reluctant heroine if you will. While Gen is practical and dependable Jack is spontaneous and erratic. So when it is Jack who brings home the magic beans he is more than ready to climb up to the world above. But things go wrong and Gen must eventually go rescue him.What I like about the series is that the books are short and sweet. Although sometimes I wish the plots and characters were more developed, it's refreshing to not have to read so much about all the world building that other fantasy books usually do. Dokey makes it very uncomplicated and easy. There is a World Above past the clouds. Never mind that it's supposed to be cold up there and the air is supposed to be thin, there are people living up there (period). But don't get the wrong idea, I love fantasy and the world building is usually very fun. It's just a nice change.Loved the whole bit on Robin Hood in the story."}, {"userName": "Anne Osterlund", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2232237-anne-osterlund", "userReview": "Were you aware that Jack, from Jack and the Beanstalk, had a twin sister named Gen? Or that the tears their mother cried when Jack traded their cow for magic beans were actually tears of joy? Or that she was an exiled Duchess from the World Above. And that Gen--the practical twin--is actually the heir to that magical realm?I liked the practical twin sister spin on this story. And that, for once, I didn't totally despise Jack."}, {"userName": "Cara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1876075-cara", "userReview": "Long sigh... What can I say? Well that this is one of my new favorites in the series. I was wondering how they were gonna pull this one off because the protagonist are always females and  Jack and the Beanstalk  is known to have a male lead. As always the series put their twist on it so we could see the \"real\" story. Gen and Jack are twins and live on a farm with their mother trying to scrape by. Gen is the pratical twin and Jack is the adventuresome one. The other big difference between the two is that Jack has always believed in the World Above. The World Above is a magical place and since Gen was a little girl she can remember being told of how her mother had escaped down a beanstalk and began her life in the World Below. Gen's mother has always wanted to go back, and the opportunity arises when Jack trades their cow for a few magical beans. As you can guess these are the beans that will give them the chance to go back to their real home, The World Above. Now Gen can only come to the realization that the bedtime stories were all true. Jack being the adventuresome one is the first to go, but soon enough sensible Gen has to go help her brother got out of a huge mess. Along the way she meets some great characters and together they figure out how to make things right.I really enjoyed the little tidbits that let us see the link to the original tale and we also see references to another well known story. The series is a little predictable, but I simply love all the stories. Sometimes the short length doesn't bother me, but this one I did get a little bothered because I could see the potential for this to be a great full-fleged novel. I wold have simply eaten it up. Still recommended and will be awating eagerly for the next one they come up with. Hopefully there is enough fairy tales to keep them busy."}, {"userName": "Bookworm Jo", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6187289-bookworm-jo", "userReview": "This was a cute quick retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk.This book differs from the fairytale in that Jack is not the main character and not the one who saves the day. His twin sister Gen, is the main character. She is practical, quick thinking and a planner; a total opposite of her brother Jack who is impulsive and often finds himself in trouble. Gen and Jack grew up on their mother's tales of her life in the world above where she was basically royalty. Gen doesn't really believe her mom's stories but Jack does wholeheartedly. So of course when he meets someone who will give him magic beans to the world above, he trades the family cow for them. And he is the first one to climb the beanstalk to the world above while his mother and sister stay in the world below. And there are giants and the 3 things Jack steals in the original fairytale play a part but thats where the similarities end. The reason why Jack and Gen were born in the real world has to do with..yup you guessed it....love, betrayal and murder. Obviously if Gen's mother was royalty so was their father and by blood they are too. So going up the beanstalk is a matter of getting back what rightfully belongs to Gen's family. So Jack goes up the beanstalk a few times and the last time he goes up he goes to try to take back what's his. So of course he gets captured by the tyrant who rules there and it falls on Gen's shoulders to save him. I like Gen. Like I said she is very practical, level headed, quick thinking and a planner. She is deeply rooted to the world below and has no desire to rule over anything or to even live in the world above. Its only because of her brother that she goes up the beanstalk. Doing this also shows how brave and loyal Gen is to the people she cares about. She's willing to risk her life to save her brother. Jack was a bit annoying. He wasn't in the book for the most part but when he was he was impulsive, a dreamer, a risk taker and kind of a stereotypical dumb blond. He's more like \"Oh your so pretty\" when he does things. I also didn't care for how he was obviously their mothers favorite child. There were also a few other characters that I liked. I liked Shannon who is the giant Sean's normal sized sister. She was exactly like Gen; practical, level headed and more cautious that her brother who was a lot like Jack. I also liked Robin (Robert) who was the tyrant's son. Circumstances led him to be an outlaw in his father's land. He had the love of the people and would rob his father's rich men to give it to the poor. He was in essence, a Robin Hood. He and Shannon help Gen save Sean and Jack.Of course there was romance between Gen and Robin. It was insta-love, which I hate but will accept in this book because it is a fairytale (fairytales can get away with that). I mean there was attraction between them but nothing more and the next thing you know they are madly in love. Whatever, I saw it coming so it didn't shock me. Robin and Gen were cute together. I wish the book was a little longer and had more romance involved. I would of liked to see Robin and Gen get to know each other more. Also the ending was a bit anti-climatic. The villain gave up way to easily. I was kinda disappointed. Oh well.

Overall, the story was interesting and a good read."}, {"userName": "Jerome", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7672919-jerome", "userReview": "A fun read. \"The world Above\" is an imaginative and fresh retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk. Dokey proves herself a clever writer with the rearrangement of the old tale to accommodate a spunky, if not reluctant, heroine and two different worlds--one 'Above', and one 'Below'. Like with many fairy tales, the true love happens with a snap of the finger, unexpected heroes and heroines nobly rise to the occasion, and the villain is quick to admit his mistakes and accept defeat when cornered. Nonetheless, all of the favorite elements of the story are present, and with a smart ending and a lesson on nobility and love and faith, The World Above is a great story for readers in want of a story more involved and complicated than the simple fairy tale.Also, Gen meets Robin, a prince who lives in the forest, steals from the rich and gives to the poor. That's right, Robin Hood meets Jack in the Beanstalk.I must say at first I was a little irritated, but soon I was delighted. The stories mesh seamlessly, and no mention of \"Robin Hood,\" \"Merry Men,\" or \"Little John,\" is anywhere in the book. For some reason, that satisfied me. Dokey's writing is, as always, smooth and flowing. She masterfully creates a vision with only a few sentences. Gen is a serious young woman who points out her own flaws and does not apologize for them. The characters are interesting, the story is short and sweet. Nicely done."}, {"userName": "Mara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6879652-mara", "userReview": "Gen is a wonderfully upbeat heroine who doesn't allow her skepticism get in the way of accomplishing what needs to be done. She's practical and blessedly admits when she is wrong, rather than hanging on to denial for the entire duration of the story. The contrast between her and her twin brother add much to the believability of their relationship, and gives them both a very distinct personality.Adding onto this is the combination of a retelling of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" and \"Robin Hood,\" which are two stories that interact beautifully in \"The World Above.\" For once, I actually liked Robin! The Author plays cleverly upon all elements of both stories - giants, Sherwood Forest, the archery contest - and even integrates different versions of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" into the storyline with incredible smoothness.The story opens with Gen saying how her story is far more interesting than any Jack and the Beanstalk the Reader has read; she's right. \"The World Above\" is, from beginning to end, far more interesting and exciting - and makes far more sense - than any version of the classic fairy-tale, and Robin Hood, combined."}, {"userName": "Meli", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5087694-meli", "userReview": "RESE\u00d1A EN EL BLOG :DUn lindo libro, sencillo y entretenido.Me gust\u00f3 porque, si bien es corto, las cosas pasan r\u00e1pido y no hay lugar para que se profundice en nada, est\u00e1 bien construido, as\u00ed que todo es cre\u00edble -tan cre\u00edble como puede ser un cuento de hadas- y tiene de todo, magia, aventura, un mont\u00f3n de acci\u00f3n, personajes queribles, sangre y amor.

I'm familiar with very few fairy tales, this being one of them. All I ever knew was Jack had a bean, he planted it, and *poof*, a beanstalk. What happens after that, I don't have a clue. That said, there wasn't anything I could expected out of the story.I found the first few pages to be somewhat confusing. I had to re-read it several times to understand who was who. I'm slow on catching on. I felt that some parts were unnecessary to include, and others needed elaborating. For instance, the relationship between Gen and Robin. It was underdeveloped, but eh, it was alright.Gen and Jack were great characters. I liked that they were opposites; reasonable Gen and adventurous Jack. The fact that Jack even had a sister was cool. A character I really liked was Steel. He's a minor character but a great addition to the story. (:The epilogue was sweet. Yay for happy endings!

I hate to give it two stars, quite honestly. But... I have to be honest. Cameron Dokey is not my favorite author, and I didn't think this was a stellar book.It's the re-telling of Jack and the Beanstalk, except that it's Jack and his twin sister (Gen) and the handful of beanstalks. Yes, it has the goose that lays golden eggs, but Dokey did *NOTHING* with it. Yes, it has the bag of money, but Dokey does *NOTHING* with that, either. Yes, it has a giant, but she does very little with him, either. Instead, disliking the elements of the faerie tale that it was, she changes it out for Robin Hood. Which works, but not well.Jack and Gen's mother lived in the castle in the world above, until a neighboring ruler attacked, killed her husband the king, and took over. She escaped to the world below with the help of an old woman named Rowan with nothing, and became a farmer, a pregnant one all alone... like it's believable that a woman in her dire straits would give birth to TWINS alone, have the wherewithal to take care of them AND run a farm by herself. Impossible.Years later, Jack gets the beans from who-knows-who, and it's TIME to go back up. Is the woman who gave him the beans Rowan? Dokey never tells us what happened to Rowan, either. Jack befriends Sean (the giant), decides to try to steal the harp from the usurper king to prove he's rightful heir to his father's kingdom (and HOW would that prove it, honestly?)... and instead Jack gets captured. Yet the giant gets away. ????So Gen has to go up and rescue her brother. On her way to the usurper's castle, she has to travel thru a woods, and Robin Hood swoops out of the trees, waylaying her. Turns out, he's the usurper's noble and honorable son, robbing from the rich to feed the poor. And the King has an archery tournament to lure his son out - the winner deciding the fate of Jack.It. Was. Lame. Everything was reasoned out, there was too much talking, no chemistry between Robin and Gen, and who the HECK knows what happens at the end to Jack, as Gen and Robin take over the usurper kingdom, and Mama gets back her kingdom. And nobody chops down the last beanstalk, so there's an open portal left there, in the end.I was not impressed. At all. Someone needs to write a less-Robin-Hood-y version, and have the giant fall for Jac(queline). Now THAT would be a good story. This...? Was a hodge-podge, loose-ended *MEH* of a read."}, {"userName": "Jeanna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1531932-jeanna", "userReview": "Yes, I think I have probably read every book in this series. I just really like retold fairy tales (that might explain my gazillion-year obsession with writing a retold Beauty and the Beast) (which, by the way, is going reasonably well!). This one was middling for me.This is what I liked: The deeper version of the story. Here's what I remember about the original: Jack makes a stupid bargain for beans that probably aren't magical. By tremendous luck, they are. Then he goes up a beanstalk, steals from a giant (admittedly, the giant wanted to eat him, but that doesn't necessitate thievery, just really fast running), and gets away. Then he goes back, steals some more, and kills the giant. Jack does not seem like a winner. But Dokey's version creates a plausible backstory in which Jack is actually likeable, though perhaps a bit foolhardy.This is what I wasn't thrilled about: I have read all of Dokey's fairy tales. I loved Storyteller's Daughter and Beauty Sleep the best. After those two (the first I read), they all felt a little repetitive to me. Do I agree that it's important to know your heart? Yes. Do I think you must risk your heart wholly in love? Definitely. But do I also think there's more to relationships than that? Also yes. It just feels like I want her to say something new about life and love and all that jazz. But she keeps saying the same thing. Good and important, yes. But not enough.Also, as a very minor quibble: I think the plausibility of the one single giant in this story would have been aided by the presence of other magic or nonhuman creatures or something. As it was, the giant really stuck out without much believability. So I'd say, unless you're a fanatic like me, read Storyteller's Daughter instead. And then, if you're still happy with Dokey, read Beauty Sleep. After that... I don't remember which to read next."}, {"userName": "LPL Staff Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43210325-lpl-staff-reviews", "userReview": "This is the last book in the Once Upon a Time series, a series of fairytale retellings written by several different authors. Every book in the series, including this one, is a quick read that stands on its own. While not the most original novel or even my favorite in the series, those are reserved for Snow by Tracy Lynn and Scarlet Moon by Debbie Viguie, The World Above is an enjoyable read with a few unique twists of its own.After reading so many of the Once Upon a Time novels, I admit to getting a bit tired of the romance, especially the love-at-first-sight romances that dominates the majority of the books. Though The World Above does have the love-at-first-sight romance in it, it thankfully did not dominate the plot. In fact, I made it through about half the book before the main character falls in love and even then, the romance takes a back seat to her finding and saving her brother. Also, though the romance is quick, it did not feel overly gushy.I also enjoyed the different take on the Jack and the Beanstalk story and the previously nonexistent sister\u2019s perspective. The World Above had a Jack and the Beanstalk meets Robin Hood twist that was fun and the story had a good pacing, not too slow. Though it takes a while for the main character to actually climb the beanstalk to the world above and search for her brother, Jack trades for the beans, climbs the beanstalk and steals two items very early in the story.Overall I think The World Above is a quick and enjoyable read. Like all other Once Upon a Time novels, it is short, sweet and has a happy ending for all.Lubbock Public Library Call#: YA FIC DOKEAmber S.LibrarianMahon BranchReview originally published in Abilene Public Library blog June 21, 2013."}, {"userName": "Kirsten", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12081693-kirsten", "userReview": "http://kiribeth.blogspot.com/2014/03/...I enjoyed reading this. The way the author interwove Jack and the Beanstalk with Robin Hood was clever. The characters were believable, and each new page kept you wanting to read more. Gen was a wonderful narrator, and I enjoyed seeing things from her point of view. Of course, Jack and the Beanstalk has long been one of my favorite fairy tales, yet it has faded greatly in the popularity of other fairy tales such as Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast, so there really aren't that many JatB retellings out there. This one was a gem as far as retellings go for. And I'm looking forward to reading more of the books in the Once Upon a Time series.My only real disappointment would be in the length of the book. It's really short, and that made the plot feel really rushed. I didn't get to know the characters as much as I would have liked, and I felt a little gypped. The ending, too, was a letdown, as far as the final villain conflict was concerned. But for those who prefer a light and enjoyable fairy tale, then this is the book for you; my curse is that I care too much for lengthy novels. *winks* So... all in all, a good, fast read.Advisory: There was some light romance between two characters leading to a kiss.
