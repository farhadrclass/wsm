The black eye is the crowning touch, though. At least you know for certain I didn\u2019t fall in love with you because of how you look.\u201d\nIf this book hadn't been written by Linda Howard, it would have turned out to be another survival handbook. But this is Linda Howard. Needless to say, she's a master of turning simple plots into engaging stories.As always, the author has a way of pulling me right into her books. She weaves romance, suspense, and a bit of humor and drama into the story of two people who were thrown together in a life threatening situation. I think the romance in this book could be considered slow-burning. I could feel the sexual tension between Cam and Bailey there, but it just gradually built up and then erupted into flame eventually. To be honest, I expected hot and sizzling romance like her usual work, but what could I do except to roll with it. Hmm...I can always find my ideal hero in LH\u2019s male leads. Her heroes are alpha men who never play games and never give up. There\u2019s no holding back, no nonsensical issues (like love or commitment issues), no pushing away, and no emotional weakness. And Cam is no exception. He is calm, but decisive and determined. When he realized that Bailey was the only one he wanted, he made up his mind that his bachelor days were over. I loved that he took their relationship seriously.How can one not love this man?Because of her love and trust issues, Bailey kept most people at her arms length, never allowed herself to lean on anyone. But after she and Cam had survived a plane crash, she could feel the bonds between them growing, and that scared the hell out of her. Cam determined to make her trust him and he wouldn\u2019t ever let her pull away from him or go back to her former frostiness anymore.The thing that surprised me the most was the twist ending. My jaw dropped open in profound amazement. OMG! I couldn\u2019t believe what I just read!Although Up close And Dangerous isn\u2019t LH at her best, I enjoyed reading it a lot and found myself engrossed in the story that I almost lost track of time. This was an entertaining and worthwhile read. Fans of romantic suspense will certainly enjoy this one."}, {"userName": "Auntee", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/886675-auntee", "userReview": "This book won't be for everyone--even fans of Linda Howard may have a hard time with it, because a lot of it has to do with surviving a plane crash, and there isn't a heck of a lot of romance or suspense. But because I don't mind a plot that hinges on survival in the wilderness, for the most part I'd have to say I enjoyed it. Not that I didn't wish that LH would have included some more of this and less of that...The heroine, Bailey, is a 32 year-old attractive widow from Seattle with huge walls around her heart. She was involved in a brief marriage of convenience (for reasons I won't get into) and now that her rich husband's dead she's forced to deal with his two very spoiled, irresponsible, nasty adult children. To take a break from them she decides to go on a vacation with her brother and his wife, and needs to fly to Denver to meet them. She decides to fly by private plane and uses the company that her husband's corporation always uses, J&L Executive Air Limo. The pilot on this trip is one that Bailey considers a grim sourpuss, tall and broad shouldered Cam Justice.Cam thinks Bailey is cold and stuck-up, and figures the trip to Denver is going to be a looong one with her on board. But less than half way there, over some rugged, mountainous terrain, there's engine trouble, and Cam is forced to make a daring, last ditch landing among the treetops. By some miracle, Cam and Bailey survive, although Cam has a serious head injury. Bailey then goes into wonder woman mode (the woman exhausted and impressed me with all she was able to accomplish) and not only pulls the dead weight of Cam from the airplane, but stitches up his head wound, keeps him from dying of hypothermia, and erects a shelter for them. All of this while she has injuries herself. Cam is grateful, impressed, and turned on by Bailey, and makes plans to get around the walls she has around her heart. It will be days before a search team will find them. If they can stay alive that long, will that be enough time for Cam to worm his way into a very cautious, distrustful Bailey's heart?I really liked Cam. He was funny, sweet, and sexy, and appreciated a strong and smart woman like Bailey. Bailey was a bit prickly, and it took me a while to warm up to her. Once LH explained her past a bit, I saw where her attitude was coming from, and I cut her some slack. I liked her and Cam together, although I didn't totally buy the love story. I thought their 'love' might have been influenced a little by their dependence on each other for survival, but what the heck, I decided to go along with it and just enjoy it.I appreciated the survival part of the story, with all the ingenuity that Bailey and Cam showed about how to salvage the plane and the stuff they brought with them to keep themselves warm and alive. At one point though I was tired of all the suffering they went through and I was ready for them to be rescued!The suspense aspect of the plot? Well, the suspense of the plane going down was very harrowing and well-done, as well as the immediate aftermath as it's up to Bailey alone for their survival. Of course we know someone tampered with the plane, but we don't really know who (although LH serves up some prime suspects) or why. The revelation at the end threw me for loop though, as I just did not see that coming.Now the romance? This is where I though LH short-changes the reader. I loved the connection that Cam and Bailey shared as they struggled for days to survive. As Cam got better, his amorous side came out, and somehow (even while practically freezing to death and wearing layers and layers of clothing) he was able to put some moves on Bailey (verbally and physically), and the payoff (when Bailey finally succumbed) was hot and sweet. But I needed to see a little bit more of this emotional and physical connection . Even though the book was over 300 pages, I thought it ended rather abruptly. I needed to see Cam and Bailey under normal, every-day circumstances, to believe that their connection was true and that it would last. A nice little epilogue would've done that for me.Nothing wrong with the writing, the characters, or most of the execution of the story. If LH would've added just a little more, I would've bumped it up a notch. This was a good story, but certainly not one of LH's (who has a ton of wonderful reads) best. 3 1/2 stars"}, {"userName": "Mo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11856352-mo", "userReview": "I have had this book on my kindle for 5 years.

It was a show in the '80's, I think, and was about some guy who could take a paperclip, a rubber band, and a straw - and somehow make a bomb. I never saw the show, but I've seen a lot of things making fun of it.Anyway, this book is more about the ingenuity of a couple who survives a plane crash more than anything else. If you are looking for straight forward romance, this isn't the one. If you are looking for a mystery - uh, no. The main thing you are going to find here is survival stuff. If you know who this guy is, you'll like this bookSo, we have our couple who hate each other get into a plane crash. Now, they have to help each other to survive, and guess what? The reasons they hated each other was wrong! How convenient! So, of course they fall in love! Who wouldn't fall in love while you are freezing, injured, bleeding, starving, dirty, dehydrated, and sick from the altitude?

It's kind of like a Plane Crash/Rocky Mountain High version of Survivor. The banter between sexy, arrogant ex-military Texan pilot Cam Justice and his aloof, yet smart and tough widowed client Bailey Wingate as they battle the elements to survive is loads of fun, and they have sexual chemistry so hot that it melts her frosty demeanor and the snow around them!I tell you what...I had a lot of respect for Bailey's character. I think if I ever found myself in the same situation, that I'd be in big doo-doo (and complain a heck of a lot more too) because I sure wouldn't have thought of all the rugged, survival stuff she did. And the whole building a shelter thing sounded complicated and exhausting! Overall, this is a gripping romantic suspense read with a likable H/H, and it might even make you want to take a survival class!"}, {"userName": "DarienMoya", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3069494-darienmoya", "userReview": "^^NOT THE MOST HAPPY OF WAYS TO GET CLOSE!^^So I read this book a few years ago, and truthfully I was not overly impressed. The second time around was a lot better if I do say so. I interpreted it a lot differently from the first time and found it amusing and very romantic regardless of the dire circumstances.Cam Justice is a pilot, not for a big airline, but a small independently own air fleet that takes rich people to their destinations. He loves his job and shares his work with his best friend and his lioness of a secretary, things are all good. On his day off he gets a call saying he has to fly Bailey Wingate because his partner had a serious allergic reaction and his unable to fly, He is not impressed because Bailey rubs him the wrong way, but he has no other choice.Bailey is looking forward to her mini vacation with her brother and sister-in-law. She wants to escape her evil step-children who hates her existence because she controls the money left by her husband their father. This marriage was basically a business situation, because the step-children are money hungry grubbers. So until they prove some form of maturity the money remains hers to handle and it is looking like forever. Well the vacation will be a welcomed breath of fresh air, until she learns who her pilot is, seems Cam also rubs her the wrong way and this flight looks like its gonna be tortuous.Well there is hardly anytime for uncomfortable moments when the plane sputters and the engine dies, and they crash in the snowy mountains. The book now becomes a matter of survival and remaining alive until they are rescued. What is surprising is that Bailey is the one who does the work of trying to keep them alive, because Cam is seriously injured and she can\u2019t let them freeze to death. This woman comes off all man verses wild, and she handles business. Builds a shelter and works her ass of to make sure Cam remains alive. Nothing brings people together like plane crashes and almost dying it then becomes a classic case of never judge a book by its cover. Bailey thought Cam was a hard ass with his sourpuss face, and Cam thought Bailey was a snooty rich bitch and they realize that they were \u201coh so very wrong\u201d. They come to realize they could love each other and it took a bloody plane crash to do it. I find it a metaphor for how ridiculi people can be, take time to get to know each other, take the time.Well we know they won\u2019t stay in the cold forever, and some quick talk time and lets keep each other warm sex leads to rejuvenation, and melting snow for water and eating snicker bars. A look around the crash proves the plane was sabotaged and now its figuring it out who wanted them dead.Not a blow away by Linda Howard but I did like Cam he is the type of guy I wanna be stuck with if my plane crashes or something equally disastrous happens to me. The sex was warm enough and Bailey and Cam are good together, not heavy hitting on plot just a light read. I raised it to a 4/stars because I liked Cam, and the other characters are well done, those evil step children are spoiled."}, {"userName": " Chele", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3782879-chele", "userReview": "[I had my doubts after awhile about who was the actual villain but I did not expect the twist at the ending.

This was probably the first winter in my life with absolutely zero snow. I know the US had quite the opposite of that but we just got loads of rain. I\u2019m Polish \u2013 I miss the snow and I miss the cold, so I asked people to recommend me romance novels with lots of snow and cold and people having to share their body heat to survive or some such.\u2018Up, Close and Dangerous\u2019 was a perfect choice. The hero needs to crash land a plane with the heroine on board somewhere up in the mountains. Of course they don\u2019t like each other at first but they need each other to survive, etcetera, etcetera. The survival bits were fantastic. I was very happy I was provided with every single detail \u2013 what they ate, what they drank, what they wore, how they built a shelter, and what afflictions they suffered from. I do love me a good survival story. The romance itself though, was lacking. If you took away all the excitement of being stuck in the wilderness, there just wouldn\u2019t be much to it.First of all, there is one lesson I learnt from Sandra Bullock in Speed the Sequel and that is that the relationships formed in extreme circumstances hardly ever survive (that\u2019s how they explain the lack Keanu Reeves in the sequel), so maybe these two should slow down with their talk of moving in together, marriage and living happily ever after, because even though I\u2019m sure they learnt a lot about themselves in those three days of sharing their body heat, I don\u2019t know if it is quite enough. I mean, they should be a bit traumatized after that ordeal and maybe some time off would actually be useful. Additionally, there is that final twist, and while I appreciate the author trying to make things more interesting, that twist means that both the hero and the heroine would need at least six months of intense psychotherapy to even be a normal, trusting person again. Jumping head first into a super-serious relationship would be the last thing anyone in such circumstances would or should do. And yet, I gave it four stars. Because in the end it did what I wanted it to do and that was to have a good snow-related survival story and outdoor sex scenes."}, {"userName": "Chitra *CJ*", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46841583-chitra-cj", "userReview": "\"Up Close and Dangerous\" is the story of Bailey and Cam.When Bailey Wingate decides to take a much needed vacation with her family, she hires a private jet and vows to finally have some fun- away from her vicious stepchildren who hate her for having control of their fortunes.Her pilot turns out to be ex military, the brooding Cam Justice- who when the plane malfunctions, crash lands and saves their life.The book then revolves around them staying alive in plain wilderness, and the heroine being an ingenious, super efficient survival expert extraordinaire.

Jim needed someone to oversee the trust funds of his two adult, good-for-nothing children and Bailey, as his PA and quite investment savvy, was the perfect choice.Now Jim's dead and Bailey has to suffer through endless tantrums from her step-children, who hate her guts.Apparently they hate her enough to kill her, since, while flying to her two-week vacation, her Cessna runs out of gas and it's only thanks to the calmness of her pilot, Cameron Justice, the Bailey, the plane and the pilot don't splatter over a mountaintop.Now the two are stranded in the snowy wilderness with (almost) zero chance of being rescued, having to rely on their own ingenuity and each other...This was one heck of a book. In someone else's \"hands\" the almost claustrophobic atmosphere with just two characters and a whole lot of wilderness would have buried the story, yet Linda Howard skillfully maneuvered the plot, masterfully twining the scenes with Bailey and Cam with little tidbits about the secondary characters.While the romance did seem a little rushed at times, specially toward the end (the two didn't even like each other at the beginning!), the explanation was utterly plausible and believable. Stranded for six days with only one person for company, one is bound to develop some feelings toward their companion...Bailey and Cam were nicely drawn and Bailey's development extremely well done, adding a tad more to making the story-arc believable.I was surprised by how well the suspense part played out. The author masterfully led the reader to assume who the bad-guy was (wonderful delineation of the character, his inner turmoil, the hide-and-seek of clues), making the grand finale with its humongous and completely unexpected twist that more jaw-dropping.Kudos to the author.

I wasn't wrong. Bailey Wingate is a woman that is taking care of the trust funds of her step children, who are about her same age. she only does this out of loyalty to her deceased husband and former boss. But it is a lot to handle and the \"kids\" are terrible to deal with. When she decides to take a vacation in Colorado, river rafting, she boards a small plane to take her from Seattle to Denver. but things aren't all peachy keen right from the first. The pilot that was scheduled is sick and she is stuck flying with Mr. Sourpuss. Then only a little way into the flight there is engine trouble and eventually the engine completely fails. thanks to the \"sourpuss\" he sets the plane down in some trees on the side of a mountain, which saves their lives, but they aren't out of the woods yet. Cam Justice is a loner but a great pilot. He runs his air limo business with his best friend and a grumpy secretary. When his partner gets sick at the last minute he has to jump in on that flight. It really shouldn't be a problem, except that he is flying a beautiful but cold and icy Mrs. Wingate. She makes it know that she doesn't like him. But when their plane crash lands in the Idaho Mountains her real self comes out and she shows him how caring, resourceful and determined she really is. She is also a very beautiful woman that he means to get close to. Over the next 5 days they fight the cold, hunger, and a desperate situation. They both surprise each other and show their true selves. And while they overcome obstacles and a work toward survival they also discover that they are very attracted to each other and find that they don't want to let what they have found go. I liked the mutual respect that the couple found in this book. It wasn't the typical man saves woman type of story. And I didn't see the twist at the end coming, which I usually do.

Still I had hope that maybe, just maybe, she might one day get back to the magic of yesteryear. Once I finally got time to read it, I was pleasantly surprised.I wasn't really disappointed with this one.Oh I'm not saying it's all there- all the joyful fangirl glee I used to feel with her work- but there was definitely glimpses of old glory in this one.Sticking with her romantic suspense success, LH starts UC&D off with a peek at our erstwhile heroine's life. Bailey Wingate, The widower of an arranged marriage- arranged by she and her deceased husband- is in charge of dead hubby's bratty kids trust funds. She does an excellent job of it- and they hate her for it. I mean killing hate her for it.Thankfully Bailey's got a vacation planned and is packed and loaded for bear. (Pssst, She's going white water rafting.) So, she heads out to meet her brother and sis-in-law with Cam Justice, That's Captain Justice to you, her personal pilot for the day.Yeah you guessed it, the plane goes down, but thanks to our hero's top notch flying skills AND our plucky heroine (who just happened to over pack for her vacation leaving them with just about what they needed to survive surviving a plane crash till help comes along ) they live- and fall in love.Ok, Ok all kidding aside- this book is rather easy. Although there is a bit of a twist as to who the \"baddie\" actually is, (No,I didn't go with the glaringly obvious wanne-be killer because it just screamed it too loudly)-it's a simple romantic suspense plot line. Let's face it, LH basically started the trend toward romantic suspense awhile back- or at least was instrumental in moving it along- can you blame her for falling back on what made her great?So yes, basically LH held our hands through this one, obviously not wanting to strain our attention span, but you know what? I just don't care. I liked Cam and Bailey. I liked her pluckiness and his pride. It's a tried and true method, **cough cough** Jane Austen **cough cough** and it works, dammit.Now if only LH wouldn't have rushed the ending so much. (HA! I swear it was like I heard her say, \"I'm tired of writing now, so let's wrap this thing up.\")Something feels \"done before\" about it, and, as somebody already said, it surely isn't a Mr. Perfect, still I think you might like it if you give it half the chance. It is a Linda Howard after all."}, {"userName": "Cata", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7100011-cata", "userReview": "\u00cdntimo e Perigoso foi mais uma estreia para mim! Li-o porque era o livro seleccionado para o BookClub RSunshine!Infelizmente n\u00e3o consegui encontrar o livro na biblioteca, nem tive possibilidades de comprar o livro, pelo que arranjei um daqueles e-books manhosos em PT-BR [o que foi \u00f3ptimo, considerando que era ler em e-book ou n\u00e3o ler de todo]. O problema desses e-books s\u00e3o mesmo as tradu\u00e7\u00f5es que s\u00e3o de meter medo ao susto. H\u00e1 de tudo: verbos mal conjugados, palavras mal escritas, trocas absurdas eu/ela/ele e trocas de g\u00e9nero masculino/feminino. Obviamente, a p\u00e9ssima tradu\u00e7\u00e3o retirou prazer \u00e0 leitura, o que se reflecte na classifica\u00e7\u00e3o e aprecia\u00e7\u00e3o do livro. Quanto \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria, tal como j\u00e1 referi aos membros do BookClub, temia que fosse parecida com o Calafrio de Sandra Brown [que n\u00e3o gostei], mas felizmente tal n\u00e3o se verificou. Gostei da hist\u00f3ria, gostei do humor e descontrac\u00e7\u00e3o da autora e senti empatia pelos personagens, pelo que nesses aspectos, foi uma experi\u00eancia positiva.Acho que por vezes a autora foi um pouco fantasiosa [como algu\u00e9m \u00e0 beira do colapso e sem treino m\u00e9dico coser a cabe\u00e7a de outra pessoa que est\u00e1 igualmente \u00e0 beira da morte], mas n\u00e3o foi excessivamente fantasiosa, uma vez que isso aconteceu em situa\u00e7\u00f5es extremas.Fiquei um pouco triste com o final, pois esperava algo mais desenvolvido, mas n\u00e3o foi mau de todo. Seria bom ver o Cam , a Bailey e o Seth algum tempo depois para ter um vislumbre de como se aguentaram e ver Tamzin na rua da amargura [afinal a mulher era irritante e m\u00e1 como tudo], mas suponho que j\u00e1 estou a pedir de mais.Espero um dia vir a ler este livro com a tradu\u00e7\u00e3o oficial PT-PT [que j\u00e1 me constou que \u00e9 boa] ou em ingl\u00eas. De real\u00e7ar que a SdE est\u00e1 a fazer uma promo\u00e7\u00e3o no site em que os 3 livros da autora publicados pela SdE est\u00e3o a 16,20\u20ac"}, {"userName": "Jane Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart", "userReview": "Nice story. Good characters.Most of the book took place on the mountain where Bailey and Cam had to survive cold, hunger, thirst and injuries. This was more of a survival story than a suspense story. I loved Bailey's common sense strength and how she saved Cam's life. I was drawn to both characters while watching their decisions and actions during their mountain experience. There was a mystery as to who sabotaged the plane. The ending was good. The side story about Seth was interesting. There is some romance but not a lot.STORY BRIEF:Cam is pilot of a charter plane flying Bailey. She is the widow of a wealthy man. They didn't like each other before this trip. The plane crashes on a mountain and they start seeing the true character and personality within each other and eventually fall in love.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Natalie Ross was excellent.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Story length: 325 pages. Swearing language: s*** used once. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: two. Setting: current day Seattle and mountains near Utah. Copyright: 2007.

Cam's small charter plane crashes in the remote snow-covered mountains somewhere around Hell's Canyon, Idaho. He is concussed. His passenger, the wealthy widow Bailey Wingate, keeps him alive till he's ready to hike out. In the worst conditions, Cam falls in love with Bailey, realizing she's not the cold stuck-up B he always thought. A book about surviving the cold, similar to Ice -- minus the meth-heads. There are some smexy scenes, some sweet scenes, and a little suspense, with a twist. I felt the saboteur was identified too easily. Why would anyone jump to that conclusion?Quibbles: I would give it 4 stars if it had a nice long epilogue, and if fewer pages were devoted to explaining all the details of survival. Also, too much mental reflection on Bailey's part slowed the pace.Still, I really liked it. Loved this couple, both the hero and the heroine.  Update: 11-30-2014 : The audio by Natalie Ross is very good, with the same quibbles as when I read the book."}, {"userName": "Pamela(AllHoney)", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/884792-pamela-allhoney", "userReview": "For the mystery/suspense part I'd give it 5 stars but there were times I felt I was reading a survival guide and well, got a little bored.

First of all, the math is faulty and doesn't account for time spent sleeping and just plain away from each other while supplies were being gathered and shelters made. It also assumes they spent the remainder of the time talking and much of their energy was spent with just staying alive. I don't care what weird math they used -- these two did not know each other well enough to declare undying love within a few days, even if you discount the whole fact that they were in an intense, emotional situation.
