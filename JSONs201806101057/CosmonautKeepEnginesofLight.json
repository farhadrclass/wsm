I won't repeat the plot summary, but, to read, a very frustrating book. The author chops between the two stories in an abrupt manner that does not serve either character development or exposition. And there is an overuse of organisational acronyms that is truly baffling. I gave up trying to sort through which faction or organisation was which. First and last names are also confusingly used. In such a short story with such an array of ensemble characters it was too much.Peter F Hamilton does this kind of thing so much better. A great space opera lives on the detail, both technical and human, and it's just lacking here. I rarely say this, but the book needed another 250-500 pages to flesh out the story.It was also quite strange that the only two powers in this alternate universe where the European Union and the USA - what happened to everyone else? China, Japan and Sydney get mentioned once as asides. Is this a case of white western English speaking writer showing his limited world-view? I hope not.And as a personal aside, maybe it was my edition but it is beyond irritating to read made up American words like 'debarked' - what the hell is that, like declawing a cat? It's bad enough reading supposedly European internal dialogue with spelling like meter for metre and liter for litre, my brain can't read the right pronunciation.grumble grumble."}, {"userName": "Peter Tillman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman", "userReview": "Another fine thinking human's space operaI don't think I'm giving away too much by saying that Cosmonaut Keep is a variant of the old Elder Races Rule the Universe shtick -- in this one, Fermi's Paradox is enforced by stern Galactic Gatekeepers, and woe to junior races who run afoul of the gods.

In a second storyline set light years away the human populations of another solar system live with intelligent extraterrestrial lizard people with a taste for weed, giant squids who pilot spaceships, and inconceivably ancient 'gods' who live in space.I can't really say too much more about the story because it's too complicated to make short sense of. This is only the first part of a trilogy so much is left unexplained in any case. Matt goes to Area 51 and then into space to hookup with cosmonauts and scientists making First Contact while conducting a rebellion. That tells you enough.As the shenanigans in space hot up there is an awful lot going on back down on Earth too, but you don't really get any idea of the scale of the crisis. The narrative could have done with some eyes and ears on the ground in the second half.MacLeod is strong on the political shadings which drive the plot, strong on cheeky cultural and scientific speculations, but weak on character depth and development. The climax, when it does arrive, is something of a letdown, which was not excused by this being the first book in a trilogy because the story arc of this novel was completed.An interesting first installment nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2526106-jason", "userReview": "Cosmonaut Keep is the first in a new series by Ken MacLeod, who wrote The Stone Canal and The Cassini Division. As in those earlier works, this novel skillfully interweaves the personal and the political in a tapestry of transcendental posthumanity.MacLeod again uses two narratives spanning an unknown amount of time to tell his story, and this conceit (while a bit confusing at first, at least in this novel) works. The \"present\" narrative takes place in the near-future, albeit in an alternate world where the EU is part of a larger Communist bloc and where alien technology, specifically a starship and drive, are being discovered. It follows one Matt Cairns as he makes his way from Edinburgh, Scotland to Area 51 in New Mexico to a space station and the future. The \"future\" narrative takes place on a world called Mingulay, which is inhabited by humans and saurs, intelligent descendents of the terrestrial dinosaurs. (Other forms of intelligent life in the novel include the kraken, superintelligent spacefaring squid, and god-like colonies of microorganisms that inhabit millions of asteroids in the solar system. There we follow one Gregor Cairns in his quest to solve the Great Game---to discover the secrets of interplanetary navigation believed to be possessed by his ancestor, Matt.If the rest of the series is as fascinating as this volume, then reading it will be a real joy. Once again, MacLeod shows himself as one of the smarter writers in contemporary SF and speculative fiction."}, {"userName": "Jerico", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/605278-jerico", "userReview": "So this is an interesting book that I enjoyed reading quite a bit. It`s a split narrative book, that opens in 3rd person, in a fascinatingly constructed setting that is clearly quite distant from modern day. The 3rd person sequences focus on marine biologists discovering their family`s business and unpeeling some layered local and regional history. The other thread is a 1st person narrative much closer to the current world, where an algorithm wrangler in a communist Scottland exfiltrates some sensitive data into (an even more) capitalist America. The writing is a little wobbly; at times it is extremely evocative (MacLeod writes revolutions and rebellions really well, capturing the build up and release of tensions well, and manages to get the recursive paranoia cycle that characterizes uprisings across with clarity and precision. Other parts are vague almost to the point of being difficult to follow, with scene transitions and narrative ligaments rushed through.The world that he builds, both the near future Earth and orbital system with it`s intricate politics and numerous references to Communist history and policy and the distant space opera setting with its distant space gods, tiers of being from Kraken on down to human, and the disruption that the Cosmonauts bring, are well fleshed out. They possess the ancillary details that make them live, and they`re both dynamic and suitably involved in a way that makes them believable despite the various suspensions of disbelief he navigates. He populates this world with some occasionally flat and occasionally vibrant characters, and for the most part his characters act fairly close to how people would. The 1st person sequences are a bit more immersive due the strength of the narrative voice used.He has a few types of aliens, or well, `aliens` since they`re all Terran evolved organisms snatched out of history and sent through the stars on a light speed drive that pauses time during duration. It`s a nice conceit, and the sequences detailing its construction and design are also interesting and believable. His sole alien species are the gods, asteroid colonies of nanobacteria who are profoundly beyond human ken. The communication sequences are a great example of writing alien aliens, and appreciated by this reader.He also has an odd subtheme linking all of this to UFO experiences, which I couldn`t believe as I read it. It`s kind of a joke, but also integral to the theme and I enjoy the high weirdness of the concept and execution here and later in the trilogy. Good, easy to read and a fascinating setting, with occasionally lifeless character dynamics but a satisfying conclusion and fun political angle."}, {"userName": "Peter Cowman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19418627-peter-cowman", "userReview": "First of all, I want to make it clear I am newish to Sci-Fi so will not be comparing it to other authors of the genre.This book is quite extraordinary for me. It has an unusual style in the it has two story lines running side by side, one revealing the history of the characters on Earth, and one moving through the present in Space. The different narratives alternate between chapters and I found this to be infuriatingly effective. The plots were fascinating to me and so my attention was held by having to read another chapter of Earth story to find out what happened next in Space, and vice versa. I also enjoyed the writing style - I see one review on the site mentioning the Americanisms in the book (spellings are mentioned I think) but I think that must have been the reviewer's edition as this is not something I experienced.To me, there are certain criteria you must meet to read this book and enjoy it:1. Be sciency. Ken MacLeod used to be a Computer Programmer and there is some fairly overwhelming technical stuff at times which may go straight over your head if you're not computer-savvy to some extent.2. You must not object to drugs use in books. My old school librarian hated this book because of the regular references to Marijuana throughout. MacLeod does not set himself on one side of the fence or the other in the legalisation debate, but the stuff does appear many times.3. Be prepared to take your Sci-Fi with a pinch of salt. Unlike my only other experiences of the genre with Iain M. Banks, the physics of the world simply don't work. Well, theoretically they do, but there is no way they could be possible by the laws we know of today. The engines used to travel across the universe in a split second are Anti-Gravity drives which allow the device to escape all gravitational influence and thus travel instantaneously. Theoretically sound, but implausible. Iain Banks at least used Wormholes for this, which are actually known to exist in Space.4. Last, but certainly not least, be politically aware. Basically the whole point of these books (this is part 1 of a trilogy) is an examination of political devices and systems. If you get confused by the difference between Trotskyism, Stalinism, Communism and Capitalism and variations thereof, you either need to be prepared to get your head around some concepts or this is not the book for you.I loved this book unreservedly. It is not often that I can give 5 stars without thinking twice. While I was reading it, I dreamed about it while sleeping, thought about it while awake and was always looking forward to getting back to the read the next chapter (it turned out to be a bad thing to find in the run up to exams!). I will however openly admit to bias. The Earth based narrative largely takes place in Edinburgh, a city in which I lived for some time so I know all the places mentioned. Also I am a programmer/hacker and a socialist, so the society in the book and the political struggles appealed to me. It was the kind of future I could dream about becoming a reality. Indeed some of the tech is already in the development pipeline (the Google Glass project = Spex?).I am also intrigued by some of the concepts introduced. For the example the effects on the culture and society of the individual planets of the \"Second Sphere\" by the arrival of the very occasional starships are very interesting. It is also a space opera that does not involve everybody being able to travel in space. In fact, only 2 ancient species are able to travel in space, one having been given the technology to do so by the other. Humans have no control over their destinations - they simply go with the ship as guests, trading what they can at each stop off. The fact that they travel instantaneously but time moves on in relation to the number of light years traversed also makes an interesting point, as the star traders live only normal human lifespans but witness history over centuries or millenia and MacLeod uses this as a way to show cause-and-effects of politics and cultural revolutions.In summary, this book is a political, cultural and technological maze that will either hold your attention or have you running for the exit. I loved every second of it and was unable to put it down. If I could I would give it a solid 7 out of 5...and I assure you, I am not easily kept happy by a book, especially a non-realism based one."}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "My first book by this author. It's first in the \"Engines of Light saga,\" but, I was pleased to discover, works perfectly well as a stand-alone novel... at the end, of course, there is room to wonder \"what happens next\" but the characters, and their relationships, all come to a nice stopping-point. \"Cosmonaut Keep\" is really 2 novels in one. There are two completely separate plotlines, and the connection between them is not made explicitly clear until chapter 18 (of 21).In the first one, we meet Gregor and Elizabeth, two young marine biologists living on the planet of Mingulay. Here, humanity co-exists peacefully with the alien saurs (and several other spacegoing races.) Visited by spacegoing traders, the colony does not feel totally cut off... but Gregor's family is involved in a generations-long Great Work - the goal of rediscovering the secrets of interstellar navigation on their own, so that humanity will not have to depend on others for space travel. Drama erupts when Gregor develops a passionate infatuation with the beautiful daughter of a space trader, unaware that his parter Elizabeth has far more than mere friendly feelings for him...The second plot is far closer to our own time - in a near-future, Russian-dominated EU, computer programmer/hacker Matt is given a disk of information by his dissident girlfriend, Jadey, right before she gets arrested. Matt flees to the still-capitalist U.S. The disk seems to contain specs for building a flying saucer. Right after he discovers this, the government announces that it has made first contact with intelligent aliens. Soon, Matt finds himself at the center of subversive political and scientific plots, and in an affair with the rah-rah-America test-pilot Camila...The first plotline reminded me a lot of Anne McCaffrey - the second, more of Bruce Sterling. However, both were enjoyable, with a good mix of ideas and old-fashioned soap-opera."}, {"userName": "D", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4789146-d", "userReview": "The thing that makes Cosmonaut Keep interesting is the amount of detail the author put into the universe in which it takes place. Throughout the book, the universe's extensive history and intricate political setting is gradually explored, giving the reader a good overview by the time the time they reach the end. At times, the universe exposition seems to take priority over the plot. The characters often feel more like historical figures in the universe's history, rather than, well, characters. Although there is a fair amount of personal strife in the story, the focus often seems to be strife on a more macro scale.The exploration of societal strife in the novel comes mainly from its political themes. The novel features both capitalists and communists, with a plethora of factions and individuals at various points along the political spectrum. Fortunately, the author's political views do not influence the story too extensively, and so the universe feels like a politically diverse playing field, rather than means for the author to promote his particular position.The complexity of the universe combined with its gradual exposure makes the novel somewhat awkward to read at times. In some places, the author describes parts of the story that do not make much sense to the reader yet unfamiliar with some particular intricacy of the universe, forcing the reader to backtrack in order to gain a better picture of the story. Fortunately, this is only a problem for the beginning chapters of the story.Overall, the novel is a decent read. Despite some of its failings, it remains fairly engrossing throughout."}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1933201-tracy", "userReview": "Interesting, and a worthwhile read, but it didn't knock my socks off. It was well-crafted, with alternating chapters taking place in two different times and locations, only slowly letting the reader see how they are connected. Clues for understanding what was going on in one area were given in the other, which was clever, but I found the corresponding changes between first- and third-person a little jarring. The near future is thoroughly detailed and felt like a believable world, but the politics were so complicated I felt it slowed the story down, and I enjoyed the other world more.

I know the adage, but still, I let the cover set the expectations. The danger in putting such an awesome cover illustration on a book is that it will prove better than the text. Illustrator Stephan Martiniere, whom I'm now a fan of outshone Ken MacLeod, whom I'm coming to expect less and less from. Superficially the book presented so many of the features I look for in science fiction. It was enigmatic, promising revelations. It was inventive, dazzling with believable technology. It was flashy, taking us someplace where imagination can run wild. It was political, offering a future different not only from ours but from what is generally even considered. There was a shallowness to the book, however, that tainted every one of those aspects. I never felt excited or in suspense about the mysteries or revelations; I never came to hope that the main characters succeed. When it came time for the parallel storylines to intersect, I was left cold, thinking, \"That's all this was leading up to?\" For all its cyberpunk flair, society was left remarkably under-described and under-envisioned. The world to which we were invited left so many basic questions unanswered. Most grating were MacLeod's politics. This is my fifth MacLeod book, and its my fifth time exploring Trotskyism in science fiction. MacLeod's challenge, as both a writer and an activist, is to make his politics real and appealing. I have sympathized with and understood all kinds of religious, scientific, historical, social, and ecological positions that I disagree with or outright reject. A good author helps you relate even to the most unlikable character or objectionable decision. MacLeod, after five tries, has never made me feel that or understand why I should care about Trotskyism. In the detached viewpoint I'm left with, so much of the political discussion and division is nothing more than a squabble. Still, for all my complaints, the book was a breezy, enjoyable read for the bulk of it; it is only as one nears the end that you realize that none of what you were hoping for is going to be worked out, developed, answered, or fulfilled. I've held out hope for MacLeod because he is working on so many issues and styles that interest me. He was a high school classmate and professional friend of Iain Banks, one of my favorite science fiction writers. They are working on similar themes and in similar directions, Banks, however, on the far future and MacLeod on the near. MacLeod's challenge is more difficult, I think. To take the future not too far away, make predictions in such a way that they seem both feasible but not obvious is more limiting. The bigger difference, however, is how they write politics. Both are leftist offering radical futures, but Banks's politics are shown through the actions of the characters and groups in big picture settings. MacLeod loves the minutiae of committee meetings and sparring quotations from communist forefathers. I prefer the more creative, big picture, far future, action adventures of Banks over the more grounded, detail-laden, near future, bureaucratic thrillers of MacLeod. I've not yet given up on the latter, but I won't greet the next MacLeod novel with much enthusiasm."}, {"userName": "Michael Whiteman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20715369-michael-whiteman", "userReview": "This is slow to get going, spending a lot of time establishing potential relationships and the two settings \u2013 a near-future Earth dominated by a communist Russia/EU in conflict with the USA and a far-future planet in the \u201cSecond Sphere\u201d of terrestrial expansion into the universe. Once everything is in place and the intertwining plots become more clearly connected, it became a lot more engaging.As the parallels come into focus and we see both generations of Cairns and their companions attempting to (re-)discover FTL travel, the strengths of the book become more apparent. The tech-thriller aspects of the Earth plotline increasingly fall away after the move into space and the space opera holds more interest. The human relationships are mostly juvenile and have a style of looking at women which grates consistently. It seems like every sexual encounter must be followed by lots of wink-wink, \"why are you two so tired?\" interrogations the next day. There is some impressive imagery, notably the dinosaur drive on Mingulay, the farming of the giants being a secondary detail but sticking in the mind. The method of communicating with the alien \"gods\" is necessarily near-impossible to describe but it was done well enough to convey the experience. The internal and external political wrangling, full of plots and coups among factions of the communists and US spies, gets wearying and ultimately feels inconsequential in the face of contact with the \"gods\". The politics remains in the Mingulay sections but feels more relevant to the overall plot as it appears the future instalments will focus on the far-future and dispense with the Earth-based.

Reading the reviews gave me pause, but it was good enough to make me want to take a flier on the first of the series. Ultimately, the plot is interesting. Macleod tells two divergent stories, on in the recent future from when he was writing, and another in the far future on a planet somewhat like ours but populated with space fantasy creatures. What makes it not work is that the characters aren't that compelling. There are a couple of love story arcs that make you wonder if he's ever talked to a woman or been in love. And with speculative fiction, you do have this dilemma where so much time is spent on world building that you might be able to let bad characterization slide, but the problem is that here there's two separate worlds that the author is building before bringing then together.

It is clear quite early on that the future planet Mingulay is somehow connected to Matt Cairns and what happens to him in a past Socialist Scotland.This book deserves and rewards concentration as much for hidden jokes and comic moments as for the clues which are strewn here and there like cast-off pearls.Essentially, just as the EU (Eastern Union) announces that it has discovered alien intelligent life in an asteroid, Matt is given a data-disc containing plans, purportedly from the aliens \u2013 for a space drive.He defaults to the US and is persuaded to travel to the asteroid (whose workers have overthrown their EU masters and declared a form of independence) where a motley collection of characters decide to build the space drive.We know that they succeed as the asteroid crew and scientists are the forefathers of the people of Mingulay who travelled to the planet in a ship called \u2018The Bright Star\u2019 which now orbits the planet, but MacLeod cleverly keeps us enthralled as to how the voyage initially came about.Simultaneously (at least to the reader) Matt\u2019s descendant Gregor resolves to complete his father\u2019s Great Work, reclaim the \u2018Bright Star\u2019 from orbit and fly to another human-settled world, Croatan.Amongst all this, as added spice and mystery, we have various alien races who exist in a hierarchical system similar to that in Brin's '\u2018Uplift'\u2019series. It transpires that human tales of alien \u2018greys\u2019 were based on the Saurs, a reptilian race descended from dinosaurs who have been transplanting groups of humans to other worlds for quite some time.Above the Saurs in social status are the Kraken, mysterious giant squid which communicate through coruscating displays of bioluminescence. They navigate ships through space, are highly intelligent and enigmatic, but are themselves subservient to the aliens of the asteroid, \u2018The Gods\u2019 who are paradoxically some form of microscopic hive bacterium.Macleod\u2019s aliens succeed where Brin\u2019s fail, since Brin tends to be rather oversentimental and anthropomorphic, assigning many of his aliens with human responses and emotions.Apart from the extremely long lived and cannabis-smoking Saurs, who have adapted to human society reasonably well, the other aliens in this book communicate via interpretative media or \u2013 in the case of The Gods \u2013 an interface which reveals such beauty and ecstasy in the microscopic societies that the process of mere communication is addictive and not often very meaningful.In his earlier series of \u2018Sky Road\u2019 books, MacLeod also contrasted contemporary (or near future) socialism with a society centuries hence and \u2013 as he does here \u2013 used a process of longevity to carry a character through into the future,It\u2019s difficult to say by how much Matt Cairns has changed over centuries on Mingulay since it is only in the final chapters that his descendant catches up with him. Matt and the other passengers of \u2018The Bright Star\u2019 it transpires were treated with a one-shot longevity drug, the secret of which has been lost, and have learned to live in hiding amongst their descendants from interstellar traders who might want to kidnap them to learn the secret from their bodily tissue."}, {"userName": "Mike Franklin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16460451-mike-franklin", "userReview": "3.5 starsThis was my second book by Ken MacLeod and was much better than my first; Learning the World. For the most part the elements of this story were more realistic and believable than that previous book.The book consists of two stories told in parallel; one set several centuries after the other. One charting the lead up to starflight and the other the descendents of that starflight. Both stories were engaging, interesting and well told. The characters were well rounded and convincing. The East-West politics were a little dated but not unreasonable so. The technology was generally believable where necessary and totally alien, again, where necessary. There were some choice little computing in-jokes (mostly early on in the book) including one in the fourth sentence of the book that I suspect will sail over most readers heads without their realising it (unless they are into the historical origins of computer gaming).Sadly it was rather let down by a lot of silly little inconsistencies, typos and confusing sentences, despite this being a third re-print of a second edition. There really is no excuse for that level of errors in such a late printing. These were all mostly very minor but annoying all the same. For example, at one point the narrative states \"I was on call all the time and often had to visit the fabs, in real or virtual space.\" Then just ten pages later: \"The fabrication units occupied a separate wing of the station. This was my first visit to them outside of VR....\" Or \"...side by side and face to face, were Aleksandra Chumakova and Grigory Volkov.\" That one reminded me of an old ryhme: \"back to back they faced each other, drew their swords and shot each other.\" Minor? Maybe. Am I getting picky in my old age? Probably, I'm certainly expecting better quality from my reading than I did just six or seven years ago. But I don't think unreasonably so; these are errors of sloppy editing and each occurence pulls me out of my immersion in the story.All that said they were still only minor technical grumbles and didn't put me off an intriguing and imaginative story. My one stronger grumble was with the ending(s). One of the stories (the older one), was wrapped up nicely, although inevitably it was very predicatable with the very existence of the other story providing a major spoiles. However the other story was left completely open with virtually no resolution at all. Okay so he wants us to go out and buy the next book in this trilogy, but still I hate cliff hangar endings in series with a vengence.Overall a very good book, if a little untidy in places. I will be continuing with the series."}], "description": "Matt Cairns is a 21st-century outlaw Programmer who takes on the shady jobs no one else will touch.
