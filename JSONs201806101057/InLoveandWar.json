In 1937, Esmond is sent to Florence to set up a radio station after being sent down from Cambridge for a homosexual affair. Initially he has a flimsy sense of identity - not quite sure if he's gay or a fascist. The first part of the novel is his sentimental education. Eventually he will meet the Jewish Ada who provides him with self-knowledge. When war breaks out he stays on in Florence and joins the resistance. Strangely Esmond, the pivot of the novel. was the least convincing character for me. While the Italians around him were vivid and convincing Esmond himself always seemed a bit implausible to me, overly romanticised. However, this was an excellently written novel and though I found the first half overindulgent of Esmond's sex life I really began to enjoy it once the war began."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "[Bettie's Books (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "From BBC Radio 4 - Book at Bedtime:\"[He] unfolds a portrait of himself in gouache [...] It is a good likeness, he thinks, if a little tragic, and big-eared.

I requested it as I love historical fiction and 1930s Europe is one of my particular areas of interest. I have studied and taught Mussolini\u2019s Italy a little but not read many novels set then/ there so I was keen to give this a try.In Love and War starts with the main character, Esmond Lowndes, on a plane to Florence being waved off by his parents, both enthusiastic members of the Oswald Moseley\u2019s British Union of Fascists. Lowndes is in disgrace after his parents discovery of a homosexual affair at Cambridge and has been sent to set up a radio station in Italy designed to promote fascism and bring Britain and Mussolini\u2019s new state together. As war creeps closer Esmond becomes increasingly disillusioned with fascism and starts to develop relationships with a group of anti-fascists.I would say for me this is a book of two halves, or rather a book of 2/3s to 1/3. I really didn\u2019t enjoy the first 60% or so. The overly sympathetic portrayal of the BUF, the lack of criticism of a character who is, quite frankly, a predatory paedophile, overlong history of Art lessons and oddly passionless, clunky sex scenes left me cold. However, once the war is properly underway and then Mussolini has fallen from power it picks up in both pace and intensity. I didn\u2019t particularly like Esmond but I was interested in his arc from semi-reluctant fascist to member of the resistance. The mindless everyday violence of the regime is well portrayed, too.2.5 stars (3 if I\u2019m being particularly generous, and for Goodreads which doesn\u2019t allow halves!)"}, {"userName": "Jan Hawke", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4252399-jan-hawke", "userReview": "A book of 4 quarters as the football pundits would not say. It is about a young gay Fascist Esmond Lownes who is banished to Florence to set up a radio station there. After a short sojourn he realises he is neither gay or a Fascist. The first part of the book described his idyllic summer there before the war and the evil of Fascism directly affected him. I agreed with another reader who felt the book was overly explicit at this point but realised afterwards that this was intended as a direct contrast to the horrors to come. The middle section describes Lowndes from different viewpoints; both from friends, family and business aquaintances' letters to him and in his own voice recorded on the back of radio tapes. This part felt a little disjointed and slow but the book became more energised in the final quarter which was both enthralling and distressing. Esmonde saw himself as an 'inconsequential being' but I guess the point of the letters section was to display how he touched so many people's lives and how they much they cared for him. Apart from the narrative and the characterisation- the growth of Lowndes from a 'foppish Englishman' to a man with real heroic qualities was completely believable - the depiction of Mussolini's Florence was really instructive. So many books are written about occupied France and how the resistance operated in other countries but I have read little about Italy in the war. And the descriptions of Florence were glorious!"}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10449860-david", "userReview": "A powerful novel that touches on all the big issues, not just the love and war of the title, but the very purpose of life. Should we live in the mind, detached from events around us, like characters in some nineteenth century Russian novels, or should we embrace heroism? Is war about groups or the sum of millions of individual stories? How can the highly civilised people of a city like Florence, or a nation like Germany, succumb to barbarism and torture?I nearly gave up on this one, annoyed by what to me seemed excessive explicitness. I'm glad I didn't because, when the novel is viewed as a whole, the sexual explicitness in the earlier chapters could be seen as a counter-weight to the bodily expression of hate that is later described in agonising detail. Why did I recoil against the former so strongly, when I should surely have been more enraged by fingers being broken or shoulders being dislocated by torturers?A character (who I shall not name to avoid a spoiler) stares at his brother's gravestone and, seeing the symbol that separates the dates of his birth and death, ponders on \"all the life, all the love, contained in that single engraved hyphen\". This is an example of the meaningful observations found throughout this novel, and it also neatly sums up a book that is full of life and love."}, {"userName": "Kellie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12088627-kellie", "userReview": "The first several chapters of this book bothered me. The main character was having a lot of sex and I was trying to figure out what it had to do with the rest of the book. Like most people, I am a very busy person and I do not have time to waste on a book that's going to turn out trashy. I read the end. I wanted to make sure that I was not going to hate the author for wasting my time with trashy romance when I wanted historical fiction. The last 50 pages were good and were going to make whatever happened in between the beginning and the end worth it.I'm not a prude, but there was just so much sex. Gay sex. Straight sex. Old perverts having sex. TMI... I wanted brain bleach for a few of the encounters. I read another review here on Goodreads and the reviewer mentioned that the sex was to show how decadent the lifestyle was at the time. Our protagonist had money, he came from a titled family, he was a fascist in Mussolini's Italy. Somewhere along the line with the book that he's writing he begins to change. Part of his journey has to do with him writing a book for his father, about one of his father's friends from World War One. As he matures, his friends and a publisher help to make him aware of his own conflict inside. His father is furious with him for not coming back to Jolly Old England to sign up with his regiment. Son stays, for he has fallen in love, he begins fighting with the Resistance. About a quarter of the way through one of the lead characters in the beginning died. It was easy to become connected with that character. #RavelryPeeps I was very upset and I decided to create a lace shawl in the honor of that character, something that takes from the colors of pre-World War 2 in a motif and shape that was common during the time for that character's social standing. I will get complimented on that shell and it will give me an opportunity to tell people about why I created it! There is much mention of shawls with this character. and it's really hard to not tell you what happens and the whole story behind it, but you will see.As a mother of a soldier, the whole story hit me. That's why I'm up at 3 o'clock in the morning on a Saturday night having not been able to put this book down. I keep thinking of a painting by K\u00e4the Kollwitz saying that \"seed corn should not be ground!\" I cried too many times to count while I read this book. The story of a life that was too short, a representation of many lives that should have not been ended because they were pointlessly murdered in wars and by the evil doings of agents for the other side. By the end, our protagonist has matured as have I. What these people were doing was not about them, it was about something much bigger. They were fighting and they were risking their lives to help other people and to make the saving of other people be possible. I will be reading more books by Alex Preston in the near future."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10804388-michelle", "userReview": "I didn't expect to enjoy this book but once I got into it I was completely taken over by the story, the characters, the history & not least by Florence itself."}, {"userName": "Sorcha O'Dowd", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11334864-sorcha-o-dowd", "userReview": "I was too emotionally drained to write a review coherent enough to express how much of a masterpiece this book is when I first finished it. I\u2019m not ashamed to admit, I was a bit of a wreck. I\u2019d just been through one of the most powerful, heart-wrenching reading experiences, and I couldn\u2019t even begin to put my thoughts into words. All I could say was; \u201cWow! What a heart-breaking, just all round outstanding novel!\u201dThis is the first book I\u2019ve read by Alex Preston, but it most certainly won\u2019t be the last. \u2018In Love and War\u2019 was an incredibly well-written and powerful novel that just highlights Alex Preston\u2019s talent as an author. The story starts in a Pre-Second World War Florence, and immediately I connected to the writing. I could feel the Italian heat, I could see the balconies, the streets and the people. Everything was so well-portrayed that I wished I could go to Florence, but not today\u2019s Florence, a 1930s Florence unchanged by war and technology.There are different parts to this novel, and each one is different. We see Esmond\u2019s journey from his perspective, his loves, losses and works, and we see the story and passing of time through letters, telegrams and radio recordings. All of which were paced perfectly.I won\u2019t spoil the story for potential readers, but I\u2019ll just say this. You will smile, cry, shiver, clutch your chest at the pain of war, and really think about all the unnamed people who died in WWII trying to make this place a better world. Not everyone gets a happy ending, but through this book, Alex Preston has given a new meaning to these brave men and women, and the battles they fought.6 Stars!P.S. Thank you so much Alex Preston for signing my book before it was sent to me.

The author writes in such a way that it evoked the sights, smells, and sentiment of the time of a city rich with culture and untarnished by modernity. The novel is multi-layered with several intriguing subplots and a bevy of colorful characters. Through their eyes, and their interaction through letters, radio programs, and telegrams, the tale unfolds with poignancy. The author was able to evoke many emotions where the brutal realities of war was skillfully intermixed with themes of love, endurance, and family. It is not an easy read because of its rich complexities, but one that should be taken seriously and read at leisure to learn and experience Italy and how its people suffered and survived World War II.

They come from the Daily Mail, Country Life, GQ's Twenty Best Beach Reads and ... something called Monocle. Monocle! I used to buy a magazine called The Chap, which had articles on how to make yourself look like a nineteenth-century consumptive, and innovative uses for a Corby trouser press. Monocle sounds like that--only not satirical.The first half of this book reeks of privilege: ex-pats abroad shagging the locals. The winking indulgence the characters and the narrative show towards a predatory paedophile is particularly queasy. The second half contrasts strongly with this--no doubt intentionally--and is about self-sacrificial heroism in the Italian resistance during the Second World War. The detail about how the resistance operated is odd, and strangely implausible, even if it's true (which it probably is, given the author's insistence in the afterword on his research). The various cells communicate in uncoded transmissions on an open wireless network, they don't observe any kind of compartmentalisation (members know lots of information they don't need to know), and none of them break under torture. Whereas I thought it was a maxim that everyone breaks, and you can only realistically hope to hold out for 48 hours to give the network time to disperse (no-one bother doing that here: they just cross their fingers and hope their comrades will give nothing away). Maybe you can operate like that in a situation in which resistance is widespread, and the authorities don't enjoy unqualified support from the populace, but the contrast with the descriptions of clandestine networks in (say) Alan Furst's Night Soldiers and Dark Star is striking.The first half is two stars; the second three and a half. As a portrait of British Council ex-pats caught up in the war and dealing with local fascists, I prefer Olivia Manning's Balkans Trilogy, and as a portrait of partisan warfare, I prefer Furst's Night Soldiers. But the historical detail on British fascism, and later on the Italian resistance, is interesting (both subjects being underrepresented in fiction in English). Though I wasn't entirely convinced by the way the book stitches the two halves together."}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12639970-craig", "userReview": "On the cover the Times says this book is \"utterly compelling\".

Vivid, faultless, engaging, earnest, profound, brilliant.I do not go out of the way to read historical fiction and both the blurb and cover meant clearly didn't have me as target audience since they drew me in not at all; I felt I'd have to force myself to read it. It was recommended to me as a book which succeeds in creating 'atmosphere' so I approached it almost as a text, 'for the purpose of learning something.' The first page did not encourage me but then I read the author's note and it was this that triggered my interest: many of the book's characters were based on people who really existed and the author resisted the urge to fictionalise in order to be faithful to historical truth, studiously researched.Now I will never forget Mario Carita, Firenze's leader of the Blackshirts and his torture house, the Villa Triste. Mario Carita and The Villa Triste were real, whether known by different names or not I'm unsure. Norman Douglas was based on a real and infamous character as well. Though this is almost a side note, his inclusion also illustrates how much has changed in the last 80 years. How different those days when a character like Norman Douglas could groom children openly (seemingly treating them in a benign and kind manner all the while) and meet with nothing more than the disapproval of his friends!But the story is aptly titled and Norman no more than a minor character, part of the environment, part of a scene that is perhaps the first shot in the engagement with the war and the Resistance that will become life for Edmond, Preston's main character. Love and War is a memorable feat of historical fiction, that I'd put on as high a pedestal as Chimamanda Adichie's 'Half of a Yellow Sun' or Markus Zusak's 'The Book Thief.'How our perception of history changes with time! Novels such as these allow us to look at 'history' as the contemporaries of that era might have done. Here is a story in which communism, as yet not fully tried, is an ideal to fight for and British self-described fascists are presenting a seemingly benign ideal, lead by educated and cultured Brits. Just this week a British resident of Italy was telling me that in Italy fascism and Mussolini are taught in such a way that the Italians cannot forget. Perhaps though, given the tone of contemporary conversations, the Brits think themselves immune to fascism, remembering history through a prism in which they fought the Germans, in which they were the good guys.Preston says he hopes 'In Love and War can stand as a monument to the extraordinary bravery of the young men and women who wrested control of the story of modern Italy from the Fascists and the Nazis, to the lives they led, the deaths they suffered, to the history they forged through their actions.'This rich and touching story achieves exactly that."}, {"userName": "Candy Nichols", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16107828-candy-nichols", "userReview": "The story if historically correct gives an insight into living in Florence as an Englishman during the occupation of the Germans and the rising fashist state of Mussolini Featuring a young man who experiences are numerous I was intrigued by the tone of the book and the general feeling of the story is a man growing up I wont reveal any of the plots as it is better to read them and find out for yourself I was sad at the end though"}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76199604-patricia", "userReview": "DNF (might go back though!)"}, {"userName": "Guy", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27424971-guy", "userReview": "Absorbing and gripping..Esmond was a tragic character but loved the backdrop of Florence during the war.

The novel is told through the eyes, letters and journals of Esmond Lowndes, who comes to Italy a lonely young man in the shadow of his politician father. On the cobbles of Florence\u2019s many-storied streets, he deepens his appreciation of art and literature, and falls in love.With the coming of war, Esmond finds himself drawn into the Tuscan Resistance, hunted by the malevolent Mario Carit\u00e0, head of the Fascist secret police. With his lover, Ada, at his side, he is at the centre of assassination plots, shoot-outs and car chases, culminating in a final mission of extraordinary daring.In Love and War is a novel that will take you deep into the secret heart of history. It is a novel of art and letters, of bawdy raconteurs and dashing spies.
