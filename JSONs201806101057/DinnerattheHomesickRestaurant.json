Absolutely", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely", "userReview": "This is my first time to read 3 books by an author in succession: one, two, three... Just like the saying when it rains, it pours, I am having an Anne Tyler Book Festival. After reading her The Accidental Tourist I went to the bookstore and bought Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant and read right away. Then last Friday, when I was winding down with the second book, I bought Breathing Lessons and I am now reading it. The whole experience is like finding a gold mine. Here is Anne Tyler who I never thought to be an author I would enjoy reading. A couple of years back, with only 200+ read books, I was having a hard time naming my favorite contemporary female authors. Jodi Piccoult was a turn off. Jennifer Egan was a disappointment. Elizabeth Gilbert was a dud. Of course, I loved Virginia Woolf, Emilie Bronte, Muriel Sparks, Carlson McCullers, Flannery O\u2019Brien, and Iris Murdoch but they are all dead. Let\u2019s not talk about Emma Donaghue. The two Alices - McDemott and Munro - won my heart but not enough motivation for me to look, buy and read their other books right away.Anne Tyler is different. She writes with so much clarity and her characters are so interesting you could almost see, feel, smell and taste them. Her settings are all in heartland USA (Baltimore, mostly) and so, reading her books feels like you are watching afternoon drama series of American families, regardless of how dysfunctional or typical they are.I was blown over by the eccentric characters in her The Accidental Tourist but I admired how she narrated the flight of the Tull family in this book, Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant. The book has 3 themes and each of them is emphasized at different parts of the book:1. The effects of a father\u2019s abandonment of his family. Beck Tull, because of some flimsy personal reasons, abandons his family that includes his three kids, Cody, Jenny and Ezra. Underneath their life stories is the pain that they have to live through because their father just, without telling them so, stepped out of their lives at the time they needed him to be there.2. The difficulty of the remaining parent to try to make ends meet for the family. With Beck Tull gone, Pearl Tull, the mother has to support her 3 kids. This book shows that a mother, however loving she wants to be, can be neurotic and lose her temper because of the tall responsibility of raising her kids single-handedly. Mothers are human beings and they can do wrong. However, it is up to us to understand their shortcomings. Sometimes, however, some of us may not be as understanding as our siblings.3. The passing of time, No matter how much painful our childhood was, we are now adults and we have our own lives to live: our own wife, children and grandchildren. We tend to do to them what our parents showed us. At the end of our life\u2019s journey, however, it all boils down to the passing of time and this theme was brilliantly encapsulated in this paragraph (let me give you a sample of Tyler\u2019s wonderful prose):\u201dEverything,\u201d his father said, \u201ccomes down to time in the end- to the passing of time, to changing. Ever thought of that? Anything that makes you happy or sad, isn\u2019t it all based on minutes going by? Isn\u2019t happiness expecting something time is going to bring you? Isn\u2019t sadness wishing time back again? Even big things \u2013 even mourning a death: aren\u2019t you really just wishing to have the time back when that person was alive? Or photos \u2013 ever notice old photographs? How wistful they make you feel? Long-ago people smiling, a child who would be an old lady now, a cat that died, a flowering plant that\u2019s long since withered away and the pot itself broken or misplaced\u2026 Isn\u2019t it just that time for once is stopped that makes you wistful? If only you could turn it back again, you think. If only you could change this or that, undo what you have done, if only you could roll the minutes the other way, for once.\u201dI am now reading her Pulitzer (1989)-award winning book Breathing Lessons and one thing that is very apparent is Tyler\u2019s ability to make each of her book distinct and different from each other. Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant has different POVs and the story is centered on a single family. The Accidental Tourist has only one POV, that of Macom Leary\u2019s. Breathing Lessons opens with a couple who has two kids and at least judging from its opening, has a different taste compared to the first two books.Anne Tyler (born 1941) has so far written 17 novels. I blame her for adding 14 more to my hunting-for-this folder. If only I could read two books at the same time, one book per eye/hand, I would read all her other 14 books straight without letup."}, {"userName": "Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell", "userReview": "This was only my 2nd Anne Tyler novel but I can already tell she is going to become one of my favorite authors. Her characters are SOOO real, and her observations of everyday life are spot on. It's the kind of story where nothing happens but you can't stop reading. She brings everything to life and puts you right in the center of the story. This one took a couple chapters to get into, but once I got situated I was hooked. I loved the changing perspectives and how she was able to show you the same memories from different family members and how they viewed the same moment differently. Can't wait to read more from her! I'd highly recommend this to people looking to get into literary fiction."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12851291-karen", "userReview": "I liked this book and really felt like I knew these characters.,, loved one of the sons, Ezra, he had my heart."}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "This was my second read by Anne Tyler, and I instantly knew that I loved it as much as the first one. However, it wasn't until the very last pages until I realized what it is exactly that I love so much about her stories: They speak the truth! From the two books I've read by her so far (this one and \"A Spool of Blue Thread\"), I can gather that Anne Tyler writes about family life and the dynamics between family members. She's a master at creating a clever plot that hides things and leaves you wanting more. Some might say that her books are boring because they focus more on the characters than they do on action, but I disagree: Anne Tyler's books are amazing exactly because they focus on the characters. Her depiction of ordinary life is so spot-on that it's kind of scary. She doesn't leave out anything - she tells you the truth as it is, and that combined with her wonderful prose makes for beautiful stories."}, {"userName": "Florence (Lefty) MacIntosh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10856439-florence-lefty-macintosh", "userReview": "Now this is great literature! It follows the lives of three siblings: Cody is bitter & envious, Ezra kind but excessively passive and Jenn is overly impulsive with a penchant for marrying the wrong men. After their father deserts the family they\u2019re left to be raised by their mother Pearl Tull, a rigid perfectionist with a definite mean streak. What struck a chord for me was how all three children growing up in the same household could all remember their childhood so differently. I thought it hilarious that they couldn\u2019t make it through a meal together without one of them storming off in a huff. It\u2019s a raw sort of story, not a lot of kissy / huggy going on, but it\u2019s real. Finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1983. According to Wiki Anne Tyler considers it her best work.Favorite: \u201cCody, in particular referred continually to Pearl\u2019s short temper, displaying it against a background of stunned, childish faces so sad & bewildered that Pearl herself hardly recognized them. Honestly, she thought, wasn\u2019t there some statute of limitations here? When was he going to absolve her? He was middle-aged.

It was a slow beginning for me, but I eventually came to love her writing style and her quirky observations on life.So, I put it out there to the ladies of book club. . . does anyone have a copy of that other book she wrote, you know, The Accidental Tourist? One of the ladies not only brought it straight to my doorstep, but also handed me Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant and said it was her \"favorite Anne Tyler.\"Me: Oh, but I'm right in the middle of another book. What? You really loved it? Well, okay, maybe I'll just read the first page and see if it captures my attentionThe voice from The Exorcist: NO DINNER TONIGHT!! NO BREAKFAST, EITHER!!

As in, we're hungry for what we had, hungry for what we didn't have, hungry for what we think we want. Most of us are just plain starving. I was ready to eat the book.I don't know how Anne Tyler does it. She lulls you into her stories, somehow convinces you that you're just out for a Sunday drive, then, BAM, you're crouched in a corner, sucking your thumb.Go read this book!"}, {"userName": "Xueting", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4691420-xueting", "userReview": "I think any aspiring writer (myself included) should read this book by Anne Tyler. It doesn't have the best \"storyline\" if there is one really here, it's not always engaging plot wise because her playing with different points of view left me quite disconnected from the characters when they don't appear after a while or suddenly a big chronological time jump happens. But it kept me reading because of the amazing, mind-blowing writing! Seriously, this are some real messed up characters and family, and there's an emphasis on REAL too. Anne Tyler adds very distinct voices and personalities to her characters, I could guess how one of them would feel in reaction to something. And I truly got either very empathetic or very annoyed by the characters, so in other words I had a significant response to each one of them. From interviews, Anne Tyler said she loves Ezra most and loves him to bits, and I can feel it in how she writes his voice. But I actually felt most distant from Ezra, funnily enough, because I could tell he was meant to be the very lovable guy but I couldn't figure out why, there was no clear and convincing example. Although Cody was way too insecure and arrogant most of the time, I felt very interested in him. I wanted to know more about Jenny too, sadly Anne Tyler didn't seem to devote a lot of time to her story. Some character at the end (spoilers!!!) really annoyed me then made me think again. I can see how the craziness of the family drama may put people off, it kinda made me take a break at times too, but then I'll jump back in real quick once I get started on it again! All in all, I wouldn't think this is a book I love lots or one I'd reread from start to finish again, but I give it 4 stars because I would flip through it again to learn from some of its excellent writing - AMAZING dialogue and narrative voice, I can't stress this enough!!!

I\u2019ve been lukewarm on Anne Tyler\u2019s novels before \u2013 this is my sixth from her \u2013 but this instantly leapt onto my list of absolute favorite books. Its chapters are like perfectly crafted short stories focusing on different members of the Tull family. These vignettes masterfully convey the common joys and tragedies of a fractured family\u2019s life. After Beck Tull leaves with little warning, Pearl must raise Cody, Ezra and Jenny on her own and struggle to keep her anger in check. Cody is a vicious prankster who always has to get the better of good-natured Ezra; Jenny longs for love but keeps making bad choices. Despite their flaws, I adored these characters and yearned for them to sit down, even just the once, to an uninterrupted family dinner of comfort food."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51395417-brian", "userReview": "This novel sat on my \"to read\" pile for years, and boy do I regret that now. This is one of the best written character studies I have ever come across in my reading life. From the first page I was struck by the clarity and humanity of the writing, and the depth of reality that oozed from the characters as I kept turning the pages.I won't rehash plot points here, but contrary to what some of these reviews say, there actually is a plot. We peek into the life of Pearl Tull from teenage years to death, and those people that her life encapsulates, mainly her three children. This is not a depressing text, or even an uplifting text. It defies such simple categorization. It is a book that examines life, and family, and how those two forces shape each other. As I was reading the book I vacillated between hating and loving certain characters, mainly Pearl's oldest son Cody, but as the book continued I realized that there is always more to the story, and that none of the characters are really \"bad\" people so to speak. They all do very unlikable and even downright cruel things, but actions are rarely just what they appear on the surface to be. I kept thinking of Kurt Vonnegut as I was reading, and how he said he never wrote heroes and villains in his books. He meant we are oftentimes both, and \"Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant\" demonstrates that idea. Once I completed the novel I realized I loved the characters. You can only feel that emotion when the author has created a complex and rich reality. These characters are real...they are me and you and our brothers, and our mothers, and our fathers, etc. And it made me grateful for them, even though it is not always ideal or perfect, and often is the exact opposite, it is family and that is a gift.This novel won't change your life, but it will enrich your appreciation of it. Our motives, and our actions are complicated, and Anne Tyler has captured that essence of human existence in this excellent novel. That is no easy feat, and this book deserves your attention."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "This is my second encounter with Anne Tyler's books and this time is as good as the first one.Pearl Tull raises her three kids after her husband just pack up and go. It's in the 1940 somewhere and there's not much a fuzz when it happens. Pearl stays loyal to the scroundel but also turns out to be an often miss-understood, mean and abusive mother. Most of the time it is verbal, but the effect on her children is as damaging as their father's abandonment. How they approached life is evident in the end when all the characters in this nuclear family comes together to take leave of the very old Pearl Tull at her funeral service. Despite everything she did, she left good people behind. How did it happen?The story left me emotionally apathetic, untouched, yet, sad. I did not identify with anyone, but that was not the purpose of the book. The readers is suppose to understand the characters, and it happens quite rightly in this story. Anne Tyler builds a strong tale with strong figures filling in around the family theme, and that speaks to me. I love books about families. Romantic love does not play such an important role. The connection to reality is much more important and believable, and in some readers' s choice of preferences, more acceptable.So yes, the elements in the book worked well together. A good experience."}, {"userName": "Reese", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2624836-reese", "userReview": "Since I finished DINNER AT THE HOMESICK RESTAURANT yesterday, I have started at least five very different reviews of the novel. I've got a bad case of Prufrockitis. I'm stuck on the \"overwhelming question\": What am I really willing to pay attention to? As Tyler's work reminds us, what we pay attention to, not only reveals who we are, but also --to a great extent -- shapes who we become. And yet, despite its importance, this point is not what I want to focus on. That I keep discarding drafts of reviews is appropriate: discarding is what many of the major figures in Tyler's novel do, and we get to see the long-lasting effects on the discarded. But as important as the themes of this work are, the book's greatness -- and it IS great literature -- comes from the various carefully drawn and evolving characters that Tyler keeps us caring about -- even when their behavior is despicable. Give me characters that I care about; and unless your book is a trailer after a tornado tossed it, I'll give your work five stars.Pearl Tull, the cloud-wearing sun around whom the other characters orbit -- as close as Mercury, as far away as Neptune, or somewhere between the two -- has a \"favorite expression\": \"'I wouldn't know you if I saw you on the street'\" (274). But I know her and just about everyone whose life she has affected.I came to this novel with memories of a mother whose dreams for her children were not her children's dreams; a father who kept trying and traveling and failing until he died, leaving one sometimes out-of-control parent to do the job of two; three children whose mother's eyes saw one paper, one rock, and one gold crown; a child who was lied to about the departure of his father; a sweet adult son who worked and still devoted himself to serving his sick mother; a family that could not get through a special occasion without someone's selfishness creating a \"crisis\" and an abrupt end to the celebration. Would I have been interested in the characters in DINNER AT THE HOMESICK RESTAURANT if I hadn't wondered whether they were withdrawals from my memory bank? Absolutely. Tyler has created beautiful stained-glass windows, artfully pieced-together incidents that reveal complex characters; and if we pay attention, even on a cloudy day, \"We'll Understand It All By and By\"(286). DINNER AT THE HOMESICK RESTAURANT feeds the heart, the mind, and the soul. The author of this masterpiece has prepared a satisfying multi-course supper at the Sickhome Restaurant; and unlike the members of the Tull family, her readers want to stay for the whole meal, even \"the dessert wine\"(303)."}, {"userName": "Bam", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam", "userReview": "#2016-usa-geography-challenge: MARYLANDOnce again, Anne Tyler has written a terrific book about broken families and eccentric, wounded people.

Hope to read some of her others. Interesting story of a family that is torn apart when the father decides to leave. Totally dysfunctional in their inter-personal family relationships due to that. The mother is a hard woman, who has to raise three totally different children as a single-parent. Despite this the children all succeed in life, the daughter becomes a Pediatrician, the eldest son an Efficiency Expert and the young son owns a Restaurant. It is the restaurant that becomes the title of the book: The Homesick Restaurant, and there is a running story line of all the family dinners that Ezra the youngest son tries to organize over the years at his restaurant and how those dinners never get finished. The oldest boy, Cody, is to me a total jerk. The daughter who is the pediatrician has her own issues and Ezra the youngest is the most likable character. By the end the family comes full circle when after the mothers death and there is a final family meal at the Homesick Restaurant - but will they finish the meal? Are there surprises awaiting them? Are certain parts of their past going to make sense?

That being said, I struggled with a lot of the book and never really cared much about the characters. However, the last chapter brought it all together for me. We meet Pearl Tull at age 82 and dying as she reminisces about her life. It is also told from the point of view her three children over the years. Her husband Beck Tull, a traveling salesman only home on weekends, leaves the family when the three children are nine, elven and fourteen years of age. Pearl then goes to work Sweeney Grocery but Tull's absence is never discussed; it is almost like he is away on an extended sales trip. There was a lot of dysfunction in this family.

If you think your family is dysfunctional and the people you're close to are full of grudges from past hurts, and angry about miscommunication and childhood psychological abuse -- reading about this bunch will probably make you feel at least a little better about your situation (!).... I read this fairly quickly and really enjoyed seeing the story unfold from the perspective of each character -- chiefly three siblings and their mother in a period from the 1940s to the early 1980s. The book reads like a juicy talk with a good friend who always has interesting anecdotes about their in-laws and extended family. Tyler makes interpersonal relationships within the immediate family and the dynamics brought about because of a broken home life reveal the action of the story in a more nuanced way with every new point of view. It's not that there's a lot of action in the book, or that what action there is is especially fascinating, but she makes the unfolding of sometimes boring daily life over two to three generations an interesting epic in itself.I'd read an Anne Tyler novel years ago (\"Breathing Lessons\"), which I think I'd appreciate more now that I'm nearly 20 years older than I was at the time. But this was a nice re-introduction to her work, which is sometimes underrated as cookie cutter \"women's fiction.\" It's not -- Tyler is a master her craft with character-driven narration and well-honed detail.\"Dinner\" had been sitting on my bookshelf for a while, and I was glad to read it and move it to my finished stack, but now I've raided a family member's bookshelf of Tyler novels, so I have less space on my shelves again -- but when they're crowded with good novels like this, I feel like it's a good problem to have."}, {"userName": "Imi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3126915-imi", "userReview": "\u201cYou think we're a family,' Cody said, turning back. 'You think we're some jolly, situation-comedy family when we're in particles, torn apart, torn all over the place, and our mother was a witch.\u201d\nBooks about dysfunctional families are my favourite. This is my first book by Tyler, but it definitely won't be my last. The plot is quite simple, as Tyler's focus is the day to day lives across the years of this American family. She superbly intertwines the perspectives of four distinct characters, a mother and her three children, as they grow together and then later separate and continue their individual lives. Tyler writes fantastically; her dialogue and use of narrative voice is incredible. Tyler's depiction of family dynamics really rang true (some parts were painfully too close to home for me personally..) and in particular I was impressed with how well she demonstrated that despite the fact that the three Tull children grew up in the same household, they all remembered their childhood and their mother very differently. My opinion on Pearl changed throughout the novel and it would be fantastic to discuss her character with someone, as her character is so rich and complex. My only disappointment of the novel is the fact that Jenny's character seemed far less developed than her brothers'. The dynamics between the brothers was certainly interesting, with Cody's bitterness, envy and arrogance, and Erza's increasingly pitiful passivity, but I also found Jenny's situation very interesting and wanted to learn more about her. I felt that in comparison to the rest of family, I never got to truly know Jenny. It was like Tyler just didn't think she was as important.

If you're still reading this then you're either disobedient or you know how truly fabulous this novel is. Anne Tyler is an absolutely genius writer. She takes a series of events that are seemingly nothing--seriously, nothing of \"consequence\" really happens in this book--but you're captivated from the first chapter.As I was reading I found myself feeling sympathy for which ever perspective was being used--she writes from Pearl, Cody, Ezra, and Jenny at different points throughout the book. When you're reading Cody you feel so badly for Cody, and (paradoxically) when you read Ezra your heart breaks for him. And it seems hard to imagine, having read any of the children's chapters, but you actually feel that Pearl (and her husband) as well are characters were rich and deep back-stories that are so complex.At the end of the book I found myself deeply saddened, to the point of near tears (if I hadn't been at dinner with my family in Fazoli's I'd probably have let the tears spill). I just felt that these characters were all so tragic, their lives so sad, and then I realized what Tyler's teaching--everyone is tragic. No one has the perfect life. Family is very nearly all anybody has, and it makes you re-think what you think of your family and closest friends.This book was easily, so easily, an A+ in my book.

The on start might not be so engaging but once you settle down in the story, the interest deepens and you are not even halfway through and you decide that this the sort of stuff you have got to like. It would take a lot not to love the story of a mother, her three difficult children, a home that is left fatherless not because of death but a sudden caprice. Or something that had been brewing for long under a calm surface, which one might have already felt, but also with gradual hope to know more of it with regressions and progressions of the story. And no it is not just the children, if there is something like a difficult mother it is Pearl Tull. A difficult mother or a difficult person, I could not decide. I could not decide what went wrong with her marriage, why that desertion of a home and a wife. Though half-guessed it, I was left unsure. There is something of the tragic about the life of Pearl Tull. In the way she shuts off the world, bristling in her own little space with her children, bringing them up, witnessing and doing her bit at subverting the clashes, sibling rivalry and bitterness, giving away her own excesses and eccentricities, there is an intense attempt to erase every impression of vulnerability and loneliness. And there is something heart-wrenching about this woman who goes on to live a long life and die with her pride intact, surrounded by her children. I am not sure if her pride was accompanied by satisfaction, or was it actually the way she wanted it. Or if she did yearn for things to be different or for her husband to return. I do not know if she deserves my pity or respect. I might not have fallen in love with any of the characters, it is true they are all flawed. But that surely does not do much to make the story any way less appealing to me. Anne Tyler\u2019s writing is beautiful, it so touches my heart. And the story she tells through different perspectives, meets an end in which all the strands are weaved into perfection."}, {"userName": "Darlene", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene", "userReview": "I have read many of Anne Tyler's novels over the years but for some reason, I never got around to reading 'Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant'\u2026 until now. Having finished the book, it seems to me that I unknowingly saved it for just the right time in my life. I found pieces of my own life in the characters in this story. The novel contains several themes but the theme that seems most prominent is that of the fluidity of human memory.. perhaps not simply the fluidity of memory but how unreliable memories actually seem to be, how open to differences in perception and interpretation. This story is about the Tull family. Pearl Tull is the matriarch and in the opening pages she is on her deathbed at her home on Culvert Street in Baltimore. Immediately we discover some important clues about Pearl.. who she is as a woman and a mother and the nature of her relationships with her children, Cody, Ezra and Jenny. Pearl married Beck Tull later in her life (or at least what was considered later in that time period, the 1920s)\u2026 she had been 30 years old and Beck was 24. Pearl had been virtually written off by her family and community as a hopeless old maid; but she met Beck and he was charming and gainfully employed (an important quality!) selling farm equipment throughout the eastern seaboard. That was enough to plant visions of a bright future in Pearl's mind and although the reality of her life with Beck never seemed to measure up to her rich fantasy life, Pearl and their three children dutifully followed him from town to town, through many transfers.. pulling up stakes and never really putting down roots in any one place; that is, until the family ended up in Baltimore. By this time it was 1944. Cody was 14 years old, Ezra was 11 and Jenny was 9. It was a Sunday evening when Beck informed Pearl that he was being transferred yet again but this time, he was going alone. He was deserting her and their children. At this point, we are provided with additional clues about Pearl Tull and her peculiar ability to reject reality completely and this is a pattern which will play out throughout her life. Pearl's refusal to accept the new reality of her situation lends the story a surreal quality. It would seem that I should have been able to pity this odd woman; instead, I was frustrated and impatient with her. Throughout the book, I often wanted to shake her and tell her to wake up! It didn't seem that she was in any way rationalizing what had happened\u2026 she simply seemed self-absorbed, prideful and mired in her fantasies of what she wanted her life to be to engage with her children or the world around her.Pearl's refusal to believe that her husband had deserted her left her incapable of acknowledging or discussing the family's new reality with her children. In fact, she NEVER actually told her children that their father was gone and that he did not wish to see them. She acted as if he was on another of his extended business trips\u2026 one that would last for the next 35 years. And of course, she could not tell her children how dire their financial situation was so she simply told them she was taking a job at a local grocery because they were almost grown and they didn't need her around as they used to. Despite Pearl's inability to level with her children, Cody, Ezra and Jenny DID understand enough to realize that their father was gone. They frequently talked among themselves, snooped in Pearl's things and waited and waited for her to tell them the truth. That NEVER happened. The family, minus one member, continued on as if nothing had changed.. at lead on the surface and with the face they presented to the public. On the inside, although never acknowledged or spoken about, Pearl seethed with bitterness, anger and resentment and when she could no longer control her boiling emotions, she let them loose on her children, screaming at them\u2026 \"Parasites.. I wish you'd all die and let me go free. I wish I'd find you all dead in your beds.\" After unleashing her pent up venom on them, she would often inexplicably lament\u2026 \"We're a family! We used to be so close! What happened to us?\" These rages most often would occur at dinner time so the evening meal became something her children began to dread. Meal time often ended with the children feeling terrified, angry and of course, off to bed without assuaging their hunger. This novel covers decades of life in the Tull family. Cody eventually graduated from high school, went to college and ended up obsessed with the acquisition of power and money.. without ever really having an understanding of why. He rarely visited Pearl and the old row house on Culvert Street. After a brief stint in the military, Ezra returned to his mother's house, working in a restaurant and eventually OWNING that restaurant , calling it the Homesick Restaurant. He tried to create a 'homey' atmosphere for his diners, serving them meals of comfort foods like homemade soups, stews and pot roast. He attempted over and over to invite his family for one of these comfort meals in his restaurant but their old habits reared their ugly heads.. the family never made it through an entire meal. Often, at least one of them became angry or upset before the first course was finished and they stalked out of the restaurant. And Jenny\u2026 she married over and over again, always choosing men who were unsuitable for her.. men who were detached and unemotional. She became a pediatrician.. treating and caring for other people's children and eventually she married a man whose wife had deserted him and left him with a large brood of children who were traumatized and needed a mother. Jenny went to great lengths to appear confident and competent to cover up how inadequate she felt on the inside. Although single parenthood is another theme in this story and although Pearl Tull experienced a great deal of stress, worry and isolation, she never becomes a sympathetic character. In fact, I find her one of the least sympathetic characters I have ever read about. If she hadn't been so full of pride and dishonest with herself, perhaps she could have reached out to people who would have cared\u2026 family members or members of her community. Instead, she continued to lie to herself and her children; and in fact, in all the letters she wrote home to family members, she never mentioned to anyone that Beck was gone. Even on her deathbed, she was full of thoughts of self-congratulations for how she handled Beck's betrayal and desertion\u2026. When remembering that time, she thought\u2026 \"Cody graduated from high school and Ezra was a sophomore , and Jenny was a tall young lady in eighth grade. Beck would not have known them. And they, perhaps, would not have known Beck. They never asked about him. Didn't that show how little importance a father has?\u2026 she felt a twinge of angry joy. Apparently she had carried this off\u2026.\" Except that she HADN'T really carried anything off! Yes, her children were functioning adults and of course, no matter what a person's childhood has been, ultimately, each person is responsible for what they make of their lives; but it is also true that people continue to carry around all of the scars and hurts from childhood . I believe we are the totality of all of our experiences.. good and bad. In the end, this story.. full of so much family dysfunction, confusion and insecurity\u2026 ended on a hopeful note for me. Perhaps I will seem heartless to suggest this but with the demise of Pearl Tull, I believe Cody, Ezra and Jenny could perhaps finally be free of the tyranny they had spent their lives under.. free of the well placed mean comments and criticisms and free of Pearl's endless disapproval. Maybe, just maybe.. the three Tulls , along with the growing families they had created, will someday have that family dinner at the Homesick Restaurant and they might all just remain seated for dessert."}, {"userName": "Gerald", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75671-gerald", "userReview": "There used to be a restaurant in Baltimore called Hausner's and I always imagined it might be the model for the Homesick. I don't think it was, though.I just read this book again, and I find it remarkable that I remembered almost none of it. It's much sadder than I remembered. And, most surprising, I didn't remember the incidents of child abuse. Of all the things to forget! Anne Tyler is noted for her \"angel's eye view\" of her characters, loving and forgiving even the meanest among them. And she certainly does that here. I wonder how much abuse she saw in her own life and whether any of the interviewers ever asked her about it."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102271-cynthia", "userReview": "Update: I've been thinking more about this novel, based my Goodreads friend Reese's review and on my reading of Jane Smiley's \"13 Ways of Looking at the Novel.\" Smiley makes some wonderful points...\"(Smiley, p. 104) And to tell the story of an ordinary family, as Anne Tyler does in \"Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant,\" may be the hardest of all to justify. The Tulls have no pretensions to distinction, other than the normal distinctions of ordinary life; they live at a certain address and have experienced certain events, that is all. Tyler is such a retiring and self-effacing writer that she makes no overt claims for her subject--like Proust, she relies on the telling itself to give it a reason. But in the end, the history of the novel is what justifies the story of the Tulls: the tales of all those other ordinary folks have given both writers and readers the conviction that everyday existence is something to be observed and learned from.\"(Smiley, p. 167:)\"'Dinner...' never purports to be a revolutionary document of social history, and yet by contrast to almost every early novel, it certainly is, because it is about ordinary people, and because it dispenses with romance within the first few pages when Beck Tull leaves the family. Tyler's novel explores the inner lives of Pearl and the children from an entirely practical perspective, never pointing them toward happiness or transcendence through love or family connection, and never elevating their status as a way of justifying the reader's attention to them.\"(Smiley, p. 531) \"In some sense, \"'Dinner...' stands as Tyler's answer to Freud, Jung, the behaviorists, the attachment theorists and the ranks of therapists and clinicians. She is saying, here is a family; here is a bad mother; her is dysfunction. But the meaning of their family is not in any theory about it, but in the details of what happened, how they experienced it, and what wisdom they took from thier experience.\"(Ok, with that, now we continue with my previously written review:) A re-read. I remember borrowing this from Janice Flood as a newlywed. At the time I found it very sad. Really enjoyed the characters the second time around.I just re-read this for the THIRD time for book group. These reads were spread out by many years, so each time, the novel was a different experience. This time I had more sympathy for Pearl, the matriarch, as I am looking at a future empty nest at my house--both kids off to college in the fall.(p. 4) \"Girls were kind of a luxury, Pearl felt. But she couldn't give Jenny up either. What she had now was not one loss to fear but three. Shill, she thought, it had seemed a good idea once upon a time: spare children, like spare tires, or those extra lisle stockings they used to package free with each pair.\"Pearl's youngest child Ezra is the sweetest thing ever. On page 277, he reads to his elderly mother Pearl from her old diary. \"'Early this morning,' he read to his mother, 'I went out behind the house to weed. Was kneeling in the dirt by the stable with my pinafore a mess and the perspiration rolling down my back, wiped my face on my sleeve, reached for the trowel, and all at once thought, Why I believe at just this moment I am absolutely happy.'His mother stopped rocking and grew very still.'The Bedloe girl's piano scales were floating out her window,' he read, 'and a bottle fly was buzzing in the grass, and I saw that I was kneeling on such a beautiful green little planet. I don't care what else might come about, I have had this moment. It belongs to me.'That was the end of the entry. He fell silent.'Thank you Ezra,' his mother said. 'There's no need to read any more.'\"I love this novel more every time I read it. It stands up very well for a nearly 30-year-old novel."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6102247-william", "userReview": "This review contains spoilers:I found this very normal as a certain type of novel. The type that portrays the mostly everyday life of a person/family/etc over a period of time, delving into their thoughts and feelings, to look into the underlying forces that guide our human experience. In this case, it's a family, and their lives are profoundly uninteresting most of the time, and wildly implausible some of the time. I suppose this could provide fertile ground for the whole delving-into-the-underlying-forces thing if done well. But here I did not think it was done well, and I think I have identified at least part of the reason.One good point is that this book made me sympathetic to women who read books by male authors and find that the women are not portrayed realistically as women. I don't feel like you hear much about the opposite case, but if you want one, I think this book is a good example. The men in this book seem to be caricatures of some women's worst stereotypes about men. If you, like me, find it implausible that the father leaves his family so suddenly without any explanation and never looks back, consider that maybe Anne Tyler has some sort of feelings about men being uncommunicative and unfairly able to leave women and families high and dry just on a whim. And then consider the same thing when you're wondering why Cody becomes a complete Darth Vader-like villain and basically ruins his own life in his weird Oedipal revenge fantasy. These may work as stereotyped man-boys who are unable to grow up, but they are not well-drawn and fully realized characters.So, despite its huge problems, this is a very quick and somewhat entertaining (sometimes boring, though) read. But I find it fails to do what it is trying to do by being populated by lame caricatures rather than the fully realized characters it would have needed."}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4867998-abby", "userReview": "This quotation characterizes the entire novel: \"You think we're a family,\" Cody said, turning back. \"You think we're some jolly, situation-comedy family when we're in particles, torn apart, torn all over the place, and our mother was a witch... A raving, shrieking, unpredictable witch. She slammed us against the wall and called us scum and vipers, and she wished us dead, shook us till our teeth rattled, screamed in our faces. We never knew from one day to the next, was she all right? Was she not? The tiniest thing could set her off. 'I'm going to throw you through that window,' she used to tell me. 'I'll look out that window and laugh at your brains splashed all over the pavement.'\"Pearl Tull leaves a lot to be desired as a mother: she's critical, at times verbally abusive; she doesn't listen to her children; she's self-absorbed. All of the characters in this novel are flawed; some are more likeable than others, but what I really like about Anne Tyler is that she manages to show us the humanity of even her most unlikeable characters. You finish the novel with some insights: There are no perfect human beings. There is no perfect family. People want to be loved, to be connected to others, but they also want to be free--and God, what a mess they sometimes get themselves in because of these contradictory desires.And just like Ezra's abortive family dinners, old age and death overtake most of us while we're still figuring things out.The two most poignant moments are 1) the moment of pure happiness Pearl recollects from her diary, and 2) the last line of the book."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2149039-rose", "userReview": "Tyler's humor, her sense of place, her eccentric characters, her use of language, and her lyrical descriptions are magnificent.

Ever thought of that? Anything that makes you happy or sad, isn't it all based on minutes going by? Isn't sadness wishing time back again? Even big things--even mourning a death: aren't you really just wishing to have the time back when that person was alive? Or photos--ever notice old photographs? How wistful they make you feel? ...

Homesick is the story of a family. A very dysfunctional family. Of course, who's family isn't dysfunctional, right? This is sort of the point it seems to me. Each chapter is some part of the family story and each one is told from a different point of view. The mother, the father and the three children are all so very different from one another, but are held together somewhat tenuously by their family ties. The father walked out on the family. The mother was the head of the family and took care of the children but was sometimes very irrational and mean spirited, almost possessed. The oldest son, Cody always felt that the youngest son, Ezra was his mother's favorite and thus punished his brother, and his mother for that, and hindered his own life. Ezra was a gentle spirit whose life attitude was \"Let it be\". This he recognized to be both a virtue and his downfall. Jenny, the daughter, was constantly nagged by her mother and eventually hid her emotions behind a smiling, joking exterior while taking care of others in order to make herself feel as if she had a purpose.I read a review in which the author complained that the book was frustrating because the characters never changed...as far as their personality flaws were concerned. But, I think that is what makes this book so real. It is hard to change. It's hard for most people to even realize that they may have a \"fatal\" flaw in their personality. It's hard to come to the realization that we cannot do anything to change others, especially the ones that we love. There's something very true, but also sad and lonely about this underlying theme."}], "description": "Pearl Tull is nearing the end of her life but not of her memory.
