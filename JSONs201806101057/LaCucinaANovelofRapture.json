And then you read it and found it to be a pretty vapid and pretentious travelogue? Well, then La Cucina: A Novel of Rapture might actually satisfy you if you are looking for something similar to what was promised with that other book.Not only are there a ton of mouth-watering descriptions of Sicilian cooking, but the prose is actually scrumptious. Really. When I see people reviewing a book and saying the writing was \"beautiful\", I usually roll my eyes because what a lot of readers call \"beautiful\" really just amounts to 8th grade poetry. Not here. La Cucina is written much like Italian cooking - rustic and simple, yet elegant and filling."}, {"userName": "Rosie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43399-rosie", "userReview": "I felt like I needed to include a book I didn't like. I really, really, really disliked this book. The author peppers the story with Italian words, but never really captures Italian culture. She resorts to some tired stereotypes - the ignorant peasant girl, the possessive father who uses the words \"dishonor\" and \"puttana\" way too much, the fat middle-aged woman, the Mafia taking out a foreigner, etc. This left me cold. I couldn't sympathize with the characters because they were so two-dimensional. The story is supposed to be about a woman who finds love after a long time alone and rediscovers her sexuality with an Englishman, but a lot of the scenes were bordering on gratuitous. I only finished it because I kept hoping it would redeem itself. It didn't."}, {"userName": "Saleh MoonWalker", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66648866-saleh-moonwalker", "userReview": "Onvan : La Cucina - Nevisande : Lily Prior - ISBN : 60953691 - ISBN13 : 9780060953690 - Dar 263 Safhe - Saal e Chap : 2000"}, {"userName": "Sve", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1997873-sve", "userReview": "\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0431\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0446\u044f\u043b\u043e. \u041d\u0435\u0449\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \"50 \u043d\u044e\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e\" \u0438 \"\u041a\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0448\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0434\".\u0418\u0437\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0449\u043e \u0435 \u0447\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0435 \u043f\u044a\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0441 \u0433\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0438 - \u043d\u0435 \u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19198565-elizabeth", "userReview": "Magical realism combined with Italian charm make this a really imaginative and romantic read, with deliciousness weaved throughout."}, {"userName": "Albert", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5916992-albert", "userReview": "Title - La Cucina: A Novel of RaptureAuthor - Lily PriorSummary -  This is the tale of Rosa Fiore, a peasant Sicilian girl who grows up in a passionate household and who in her way finds her own passions. From the men she loves to the cooking she does. Rosa's family has always been suspect in her small village. Her mother's powerful and lustful ways the stuff of much gossip. Until the birth of her brothers, Siamese twins, proof of her mother's wickedness the gossip was always in whispers. For Rosa, in her youth she falls in love with young Bartolomeo, the son of a local Don of the Mafioso. A relationship that would not be permitted.\"..Then you may begin the rolling. Dust the table lightly with flour and divide your dough into eight equal pieces. Taking one piece, begin rolling by moving the rolling pin in a motion away from you, pressing evenly to create a rectangular shape. Continue thus until your sheet of pasta is long and thin and about the thickness of the blade of a knife. The knife that slit Bartolomeo's throat. Slicing through his beautiful young flesh like coltello through lard...\" In her grief, young Rosa cooks and cooks. Her recipes and abundance of food feeds her family and the village. She cooks herself into exhaustion. No longer able to stay in the village where her young love was murdered she leaves to become a librarian in the small town of San Domenico. Twenty five years pass and she has settled into a new life of her own. Far from her village, from her family and from the two passions in her life. Until one day a foreigner comes into the library looking for manuscripts on the recipes of the cultures that had built the city and the island of Sicily. With the arrival of this L'Inglese, the passions that had laid dormant in Rosa would re-ignite. Her love and her cooking.\"..Of course, signor,\" I said very quickly, as if afraid my courage would desert me at the last moment, \"if you really want to know about our food, you will not find it in books.\" \"No?\" L'Inglese read the signal. \"You, um, you need someone to show you.\" I looked at him squarely while blushing like a beetroot. \"You mean you cook, signorina?\" he asked, his eyes bright with a sudden fire.\" \"Signor,\" I said, \"I cook...\" Together, with her L'Inglese, Rosa comes alive again. But will the disapproval of her family reach out to take her happiness away once again?Review -  La Cucina is very similar in its telling as Like Water For Chocolate and if you loved Like Water for Chocolate, you will love La Cucina. If you didn't get Like Water for Chocolate, you will not get La Cucina. It is romantic and passionate but not erotica in a obvious way. It is subtle yet powerful. Prior chooses to be descriptive about the passion and dreams of her characters rather than the acts themselves. The influence of family and small village life is also interesting and adds another dimension to the happenings in this novel. All around a very good read."}, {"userName": "Tanya", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/709053-tanya", "userReview": "L\u2019histoireLa Cucina se passe au d\u00e9but du 20e si\u00e8cle.

What can I say, I finished it, and it's not as bad as expected, but it's not great.The story is OK - what there is of it - only daughter Rosa grows up on a farm in Sicily in the 1920s surrounded by her dominating mother and multiple brothers - no cliches here! She has a short-lived romance with a local boy but he is contracted to marry the Don's daughter and is murdered by his father for dishonouring the family. Distraught, Rosa throws herself into cooking, cue lots of descriptions of classic Italian foods, puts on weight, and runs away to Palermo and hides out working in a library for 25 years, until one day an ugly Englishman appears to research the cuisine of the region and sweeps her off her feet for a summer of love and food porn. There are some grotesque scenes involving oysters, spaghetti and bodies that would put most people off both food and sex for some time. Then suddenly, like her father so many years before, her lover disappears and poor Rosa falls back into fantasy land. I won't spoil the end of the story as that was what kept me reading to the end.The most annoying thing was the writing style - a mixture of first person and omniscient that doesn't work, she should've chosen one or the other, and ridiculous comments like referring to bad things always happening in the basement in movies... Not in 1958 they didn't...The foodie stuff didn't do much for me, I'm not that enamoured of Italian food anyway, and the OTT descriptions were just too much - what was supposed to be sensual just turned my stomach, and the \"love scenes\", while not as graphic as I feared, were in no way sexy. There were also way too many descriptions of masturbating priests and Peeping Tom's, and people getting it on in cowsheds - I suppose they're meant to convey the lustiness of Sicilian life but it really just showed the hypocrisy of the culture."}, {"userName": "Val", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5271574-val", "userReview": "The author takes a lighthearted and superficial romp through Sicilian stereotypes regarding food, sex and honour. It is a quick and sometimes amusing read, which I quite enjoyed, but neither the descriptions of the sex or of the food really reach the heights of rapture. There is plenty of sweaty pounding of dough and flesh, but the pivotal scene combining food and sex just made me laugh and I'm not sure whether this was intended or not.The book is divided into seasons. In Winter we hear of a series of tragedies which have afflicted the Fiore family over the years: the birth of Siamese twins, Papa's disappearance, Grandfather's death. After each Rosa cooks. Her latest cooking spree seems at first to be a continuation of those, but is caused by Rosa's boyfriend's murder, a completely over-the-top act by his Mafioso father which I can't imagine we were intended to take seriously. Rosa also over-reacts, slaughters all the farm animals, cooks far too much food, pounds more pasta dough, etc. and then, when her mother eventually persuades her to stop, she leaves home. At this point I saw the book as a pastiche, a kind of Cold Comfort Farm with Sicilian sunshine and a volcano rumbling in the background.After this promising start the book unfortunately abandons the farcical overtones and much of the humorous touch. It becomes a story of an overweight, middle-aged librarian finding love with a mysterious stranger; Spring is the anticipation, Summer the consummation and Autumn the withering. The second half of the book is not funny, apart from the food sex scene mentioned, so that I wondered if the humour in the earlier section was accidental. At least the sex was consensual, not abusive, and it was enjoyed by all participants.PS Don't try to follow the recipes, they are all incomplete, confusing or wrong.

Some of the supporting characters were basically vague outlines rather than fully developed personalities but I don't hold this against the author because it is a fairly short book and I don't believe it hurt the plot. There are a few too many perverts, weirdos or just plain quirky folks in this book but again, it doesn't really detract from the plot.I'm sure this book has been compared to Like Water for Chocolate numerous times so I'll refrain from making the same comparison.

La Cucina, the heart of the family's lush estate, was a place where generations of Fiore women prepared sumptuous feasts and where the drama of extended family life was played out around the age-old table.When Rosa was a teenager, her own cooking became the stuff of legend in this small community that takes pride in the bounty of its landscape and the eccentricity of its inhabitants. Rosa's infatuation with culinary arts was rivaled only by her passion for a young man, Bartolomeo, who, unfortunately, belonged to another. After their love affair ended in tragedy, Rosa retreated first into her kitchen and then into solitude, as a librarian in Palermo. There she stayed for decades, growing corpulent on her succulent dishes, resigned to a loveless life.Then, one day, she meets the mysterious chef, known only is I'Inglese, whose research on the heritage of Sicilian cuisine leads him to Rosa's library, and into her heart. They share one sublime summer of discovery, during which I'lnglese awakens the power of Rosa's sensuality, and together they reach new heights of culinary passion. When I'Inglese suddenly vanishes, Rosa returns home to the farm to grieve for the loss of her second love. In the comfort of familiar surroundings, among her, growing family, she discovers the truth about her loved ones and finds her life transformed once more by the magic of her cherished Cucina.Exuberant and touching, La Cucina is a magical evocation of lifes mysterious seasons and the treasures found in each one. It celebrates family, food, passion, and the eternal rapture of romance.", "title": "La Cucina: A Novel of Rapture", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20643643-la-cucina", "average": 3.47, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390864460l/20643643.jpg", "reviews": 193, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/212530.Lily_Prior", "name": "Lily Prior"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Food and Drink", "Romance", "Cultural", "Magical Realism"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20643643-la-cucina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/401528.La_Cucina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18331192", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13550003-la-cucina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1086194.La_Cucina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/372767.Nectar", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1292523.Ardor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/918250.Cabaret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15755442-la-cucina-seconda", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10322257-the-first-time-i-heard-anthea-speak"]}
