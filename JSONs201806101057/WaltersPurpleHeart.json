It was such a refreshingly different story line. The truisms were plentiful, I highlighted several of them.

When I compare it with \"Say Goodbye for Now,\" I get very sad. Weird obsession with justice and moving on = misguided. Especially given the assertion that this ephemera ceases to matter once we die and are subsumed into oneness with time and the universe. Additionally, what a boring and dickless man was this Walter. Yawn. Also, why wasn't Michael more assertive about pursuing his own life and desires?? Finally, it was too long, continuing looong after Walter had completed his self-assigned mission. If there had been a plot twist at the end, it might have been worth it. Alas, no such luck. Still, this writer is clearly a true talent, as you can see when she has a real story to tell. I would give a different tome of hers a try, and I will. My new rule for myself is _never_ to read anything having the slightest reference to WWII- I AM OVER IT."}, {"userName": "Lyndsey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8077267-lyndsey", "userReview": "My rating is really based on the first 80% of the book, which was interesting and unique. It had the same quality of the author's other novels but with a really different spin. As usual, there was depth and interesting backstories, sorrow, and triumph. But the really interesting thing was having the story of Walter told by Walter after his death. However, I actually was a little over the ending; I thought the beginning was messy and real- the ending didn't need to be so tidy. Still beautiful."}, {"userName": "Hank Pharis", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3610199-hank-pharis", "userReview": "Quite different from most of the rest and not quite as good.

I am glad this wasn't the first book I read by this author. I may not have stuck with the confusing parts. I'm glad I read on. Walter has to kiss his girl good night. He has to kiss her in a way that will last through WWII, if he comes home or forever if he doesn't. Usually, when the hero dies, the story is over. This one is just beginning.We're headed back to Henderson field, relieved of the WORST duty known to man. I never really knew how awful a job was until that magic moment when I got to stop. Death doesn't hurt. Sometimes the events leading up to it can be painful, but the dying is always easy. There's a special kind of freedom to that moment. Things don't wait for a person to believe in them, they happen. Walter found a real sense of safety in reincarnation. Nothing ends but everything changes. In those changes something is gained but something very important is lost. It's so much bigger than words. I have to squeeze it down small to fit into words. Then it's like a shadow of what I know I felt. Now the most tedious and uneventful day I ever spent feels like a gift."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35624333-pam", "userReview": "Very Interesting BookNot sure I believe in the premise of this book, but found this book very interesting nevertheless. Wasn't sure I liked Michael at first, wondered why Walter picked him, but grew to like him. Liked Walter a lot, bad things happen to good people. Mary Ann got dealt a bad hand, but not sure marrying Walter was a good choice, especially when she explained why Walter and her never had a family! Andrew still mulling him over in my mind, although he paid for his choices all his life. Book really drew me in, again interesting premise. This is the 2nd book I read by this author!

I have enjoyed most of the books I've read by Catherine Ryan Hyde - but this one was not my favorite. The premise is a little strange, but even if you can suspend belief long enough to follow along, it still doesn't hold together. There are 4 main characters in the book, and while Mary Ann, Andrew and Walter are wonderfully crafted, Michael just doesn't get his due. He is more of a suggestion than a character, yet all of the action circles around him."}, {"userName": "Galina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5184782-galina", "userReview": "Having finished this book I'm still doubting if I read something good and just haven't noticed or it was really so stupid as I feel. I give these 2 stars only for some parts with the memories - it's really enjoyable and well-written. But the whole plot is absolute craziness - like \"Pearl Harbour\" movie scenario is transferred into trash movie. Reincarnation, spiritual tables, love between 21-years old boy and 60+ woman... Doesn't this writer feel by herself that something is wrong with the story? THis book has high ratings so you always have chance to make your own opinion.

The story is about reincarnation, but even if I can let my mind go there and believe the premise, how it plays out is just too unbelievable. I do not believe that the main characters would be affected or act the way that they did.

Michael Steeb is young and more than a bit lost, living a ramshackle life in California with few material possessions, little direction and no real goals, until Walter arrives. As the dead man's past becomes entwined with Michaels' own memories, this spiritual connection moves Michael's mind and transforms his identity and direction. Walter gives Michael a mission: to find Walter's old war buddy, Andrew, and tell him the truth about Walter's Purple Heart. Finally locating the sixty-year old man, Michael travels to Albuquerque to relay Walter's message. He arrives to a surprise: not only does he find Andrew, he also finds Mary Ann, the girl left behind after Walter was killed by a Japanese soldier. It seems that Andrew stepped in and took care of everything when Walter didn't come home, including his best friend's fiancee. While Andrew considers Michael to be deluded, or a conman, or both, Mary Ann falls in love with the young man as a way of reenacting her love affair with Walter. Together, the two explore the past and search for the future, despite the realities that may forever change their lives.", "title": "Walter's Purple Heart", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215635.Walter_s_Purple_Heart", "average": 3.98, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387736756l/215635.jpg", "reviews": 45, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/126447.Catherine_Ryan_Hyde", "name": "Catherine Ryan Hyde"}], "type": ["Fiction", "War", "Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215635.Walter_s_Purple_Heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18888928-walter-s-purple-heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215631.Pay_It_Forward", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6780660-when-i-found-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19355355-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33389838-allie-and-bea", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
