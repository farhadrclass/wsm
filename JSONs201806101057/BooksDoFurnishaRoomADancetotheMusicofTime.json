The central plot thrust of book 10, or the first book of the final season/October (if you will) centers on X. Trapnel a novelist loosely based on Julian McLaren-Ross a writer described by his biographer as \"mediocre caretaker of his own immense talent\". This novel is the first of the post WWII novels. It takes place in the years immediately after WWII when England is dealing with the social and economic turmoil of the Post war years. Powell describes these changes by describing how the sea and tides will roll certain things back, lose certain things, and propel new things onto shore. I'm obviously paraphrasing because it is late and I haven't the energy right now to find the damn quote. Anyway, it was an interesting brick in this series, not my favorite, but rewarding for some of its dialogue and plot twists. * An amazingly rich work that I'm almost done with myself (I've got two hundred pages left in the last of the three partitions.

It is strange, and informative, to read an evocation of the atmosphere of post-war austerity in England, a period that doesn't appear to feature too often in literature (in contrast to the pre-War years and the war itself). As the title suggests, Books Do Furnish a Room is about publishing, and specifically the publishers, Quiggins and Craggs, including their new literary magazine Fission which Nick Jenkins joins. Plenty of pre-war characters reappear, along with a younger bohemian crowd most notably the up-and-coming novelist X. Trapnel (famously based upon a literary hero of mine Julian Maclaren-Ross). From what I know of Julian Maclaren-Ross, X. Trapnel appears to be a fairly faithful rendition of his personality, and his strengths and foibles.At the start of Books Do Furnish a Room we discover that narrator Nick Jenkins is writing a study of Robert Burton author of \"The Anatomy of Melancholy\", which was first published in 1621. I had never heard of Burton, or his book, but was inspired to find out more. The full title of The Anatomy of Melancholy is \"The Anatomy of Melancholy, What it is: With all the Kinds, Causes, Symptomes, Prognostickes, and Several Cures of it. In Three Maine Partitions with their several Sections, Members, and Subsections. Philosophically, Medicinally, Historically, Opened and Cut Up\" which I think gives a good indication of what the reader might expect. Nick Jenkins makes numerous small references to Burton throughout this volume which doubtless adds yet another layer of enjoyment for Robert Burton aficionados.After the formality of the war years, Books Do Furnish a Room contains more humour and Anthony Powell seems to consciously add in more comedy including one of the most funniest accounts of a funeral I have ever read.Pamela Flitton, who we first encounter in The Military Philosophers, continues to live up to her billing as the ultimate femme fatale and, once again, wreaks havoc. She is a wonderful literary creation. Meanwhile, our narrator, Nick Jenkins, now in middle age returns to both his university and his school in this volume which provokes reacquaintance with some old characters, and reflections on his younger self. As with previous volumes, this book is funny, wise, compelling and addictive. Taken as a whole, A Dance to the Music of Time is really something special. Now, with only two volumes left to read, my heart is heavy at the prospect of finishing this magnificent work of literature. It is one of the best things I've ever had the pleasure of reading and I will be revisiting these books again before too long."}, {"userName": "Ted", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7213075-ted", "userReview": "In the new year, without further compromise, Dickensian winter set in. Snow fell, east winds blew, pipes froze, the water main (located next door in a house bombed out and long deserted) passed beyond insulation or control. the public supply of electricity broke down. Baths became a fabled luxury of the past.\nor, if you prefer,Takes place: winter 45-46 to late autumn \u201847. Somewhere in here Nick Jenkins has probably entered his fifth decade.Book published: 1971. Anthony Powell was 65 years old.The main characters (by roughly the number of pages they are referenced on \u2013 with new characters in bold) \u2013 Widmerpool, X. (Francis Xavier) Trapnel, Pamela Flitton, Lindsay 'Books-do-furnish-a-room' Bagshaw, J.G. Quiggin, Viscount Erridge, \u2018Sillers' Sillery, Gypsy Jones, Roddy Cutts, Leonard Short, Howard Craggs, Ada Leintwardine - and with a tip of the hat to Robert Burton, the 17th century writer of The Anatomy of Melancholy.One thing I noted when making this list is that, whereas in the preceding books set during the War, a list mentioning characters who had fifteen or more pages in the novel circumscribed a cast of about ten. But in Books Do Furnish a Room that 15-page level of engagement would require a playbill mentioning almost twice as large a cast.This larger cast, though not surprising given the situation of the war narrative in the prior volumes, does indicate the general truth that now, with the war over, Powell\u2019s characters, Jenkins as well as the others, are beginning to reestablish the prewar variety of everyday human connections. In a similar way, many of the characters which would be shown on the lower half of such a playbill would again be members of the Toland family, Jenkins\u2019 in-laws. During the war, there was the occasional set piece in which several Tolands were present \u2013 and of course Jenkins\u2019 wife Isobel was never too far in the background. But with the war now over, these lesser familial connections again take a more prominent role in Jenkins\u2019 affairs. Moving into the post-war years, Powell shows us that Jenkins - and by implication society in general - has been freed from the necessarily more focused regimen of his life during the war. Not that everything has returned to \u201cnormal\u201d, as so defined in pre-war days, but rather that there is an attempt, a yearning, to refocus on some routine, some way of life, which had been abrogated by reason of that regimen.Widmerpool Windmerpool, as in the previous two volumes, plays the leading role, and Pamela (as in her introductory role in the last book) is an extremely important character. How has this come to be? Is Powell saying something extremely important about Widmerpool as a type?In searching for an answer, I thought of a regular feature that I remember from the old Readers Digest my parents received when I was young \u2013 something like \u201cThe Most Unforgettable Character I\u2019ve Ever Met\u201d. I think many (most?) of us can bring up someone from our life\u2019s passage, perhaps someone we may not have even been emotionally close to, who has remained lodged in our memories over the years. Someone not constantly in mind, but a person who, for reasons obvious or obscure, pops into our consciousness at random intervals \u2013 and someone who, once resurrected from the unconscious, floods us with a certain set of memories, pleasant or otherwise, that remains clearer and more detailed than there seems any reason to warrant.This isn\u2019t a perfect likeness. Widmerpool is much more (to Jenkins) than a mere set of memories revisited at odd times through his life. He is a character encountered again and again, and in the years of these later volumes, for extended periods of time, with frequent personal contact. Yet for all that imperfection, I see (for myself) Widmerpool best viewed as that Unforgettable Character (that I really do have in my own life) \u2013 not someone so knit into my experience as Widmerpool is to Jenkins, but someone who shares many of the colors with which Powell paints him. A person whom one can get along with, but unpleasant, not well-liked, full of himself \u2013 and one who has enough interaction with oneself and one\u2019s friends, and enough force of action, to play a negative role in things. Books Do Furnish a RoomThere\u2019s no mystery where this book\u2019s title comes from. You must have seen the source in that list of characters above. Jenkins even tells us a couple legends of how Bagshaw\u2019s sobriquet arose \u2013 one involving a large bookcase toppling on him, another involving the man advancing naked through the book-lined study of a drama critic, toward a paramour (being the critic\u2019s wife) \u2013 in both stories Bagshaw having uttered the titular phrase. (Though Jenkins admits that the truth of the matter \u201cwas lost in the mists of the past\u201d.) But apart from Bagshaw\u2019s appellation, his entire career serves as a signpost to the topic which the book\u2019s narrative swirls around \u2013 that of books, books, books \u2013 the writing and the publishing world of the post-war years. Despite lingering paper shortages, almost all the significant characters in the novel are involved in one way or another in producing copy for the larger world to read.The central enterprise which links most of these characters is Quiggin & Craggs, a left-leaning publishing house established after the war by Quiggin (Marxist) and Craggs (left wing pub.); and especially a Q&C house magazine, Fission. Widmerpool, now a Labour MP, is on the board, and uses Fission as an outlet for the promulgation of his political and economic views; X. Trapnel an up and coming author signed by Q&C, frequent contributor to the magazine; Bagshaw a longtime journalist, \u201cdeeply learned in left-wing lore\u201d, and editor of Fission; Sillery, well-remembered don from Jenkin\u2019s school days, reentering the narrative and signing a lucrative deal for his diaries with Q&C; Gypsy Jones, long time CP member, now married to Craggs and influential in unofficial capacity as promulgator of the party line; and Ada Leintwardine, Sillery\u2019s secretary after the war, joining Q&C in similar capacity, but soon published herself as a novelist.The publishing world in these years, for Jenkins, saturated with the fellow-traveler, Communist-impregnated fog of the pre-war years, the Fascism of the ultimate enemy now vanquished, once again the specter of Marx rising out of the ruins \u2013 Russia to be viewed as a valiant partner in the triumph, a beacon to a more just economic world? Or as a virulent foe, now that the preliminary bout won, standing in the way of a less-revolutionary progress?Powell uses this world of writing to manufacture a magnificently satirical (and ridiculous) compendium of titles, mentioned as dating to, or recalled in, these years: from memoirs of the war by unnamed authors [one of these not mentioned by the author] (Moss off a Rolling Stone, Crying or Laughing Out Loud: When Did It Matter?, Purged Not in Lethe, Slow on the Feather, Stockbroker in Sandals); to titles casually mentioned [ditto] (Comrades at First Sight Yet Lovers in Arms: A Novel, A Hundred Disagreeable Sexual Experiences, Marx Without Tears, The Pistons of our Locomotives Sing the Songs of Our Workers); to books and articles written by the characters, forming structural elements in the narrative (Affirmative Action and Negative Values, Assumptions of Autarchy v. Dynamics of Adjustment, Bin Ends, Camel Ride to the Tomb, Profiles in String, Dogs Have No Uncles, Borage and Hellebore: a Study, Integral Foundations to a Fresh Approach to Art for the Masses, I Stopped at a Chemist, Mimosa, Miscellaneous Equities, Paper Wine, Secretions, Sad Majors, Sweetskin, Unburnt Boats); and finally a lecture delivered by Mark members, Kleist, Marx, Sarte, the Existentialist Equilibrium.Borage and Hellebore: a Study \u2026 or, Time Marches OnAs the book opens, we find Jenkins returning to university to engage in research for his only non-fiction book, named above. Rather inaptly named as far as sales go, a study of Robert Burton. (Well, the plants borage and hellebore are both mentioned by Burton, but who would know?)Reverting to the University at forty, one immediately recaptured all the crushing melancholy of the undergraduate condition. As the train drew up to the platform, before the local climate had time to impair health, academic contacts disturb the spirit, a more imminent gloom was reestablished, its sinewy grip in a flash making one young again. Depressive symptoms, menacing in all haunts of youth, were in any case easily aroused at this period, to be accepted as delayed action of the last six years. The odd thing was how distant the recent past had become, the army now as stylized in the mind \u2013 to compare another triumphal frieze \u2013 as the legionaries of Trajan\u2019s Column, exercising, sacrificing, sweating at their antique fatigue, silent files on eternal parade to soundless military music.Jenkins and Burton \u2013 the melancholy brought on by advancing time. Into the war as a still-young (or at least youngish yearning) man, out of it as one entering, perhaps already arrived in, middle age - even though not directly involved in the most intimate aspects of facing the enemy. The abrupt shift in perspective having been brought about by the war years, which form a chasm across which that which came before, and the continuance of life coming after, seem somehow unbridgeable. Not only have things changed (bomb-damaged buildings, some still used though needing repair, others abandoned; liquor and wine supplies unrecovered to previous levels, forcing low quality, if not watered down, libations), but the view of those things has changed; and together, the different landscape, plus the changed perspective, produce this intense uneasiness which infects both Jenkins and the reader - particularly the reader advancing like Jenkins, or even leading him, into the first stage of the Winter of their years. The Indian Summer has been all but missed entirely, and the cold \u201cDickensian winter\u201d is not too far off on the calendar."}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "The war is over and those who survived try to readjust to peace\u2026Books Do Furnish a Room turns around literature and books\u2026 And, of course, it turns around writers.\u201cA novelist writes what he is.

Fission's most notable contributors are the ever-present Widmerpool, now an MP contributing unreadable articles on economics; and the talented but impecunious novelist X Trapnel. As the novel progresses, the two men's fates twine, with narrator Nick Jenkins present at most of the crucial points.The individual novels of the Dance are at their best when they use a single character's story to frame the series' interplay of coincidence and reflection. Trapnel is a particularly well-drawn and interesting example, and so this is a particularly strong volume. It helps, too, that Pamela Widmerpool is a lot more entertaining in this book - still barely believable in her malice, but funnier, and as a force of nature and narrative she works. But, as ever, it's the side characterisations and vignettes that often truly resonate - particularly (since we're into the Winter trilogy) revisiting characters from the earliest novels and seeing what they made of themselves. Less than expected, in some cases: the opening encounter with master networker Sillery is particularly well done - presented as a man of influence and substance in volume 2, he shows up in this book as the shabby, conceited and rather pitiable creature he always was. Other old characters - like the ambitious one-time firebrand Quiggin - find some kind of settlement too. Powell's (and the narrator's) amused Tory contempt for the left shows through a little, but he's too good a novelist to rely on being mean, and there's just as much affection in this tightly drawn, evocative portrait of a literary milieu."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3301814-james", "userReview": "Sometimes I feel books should come with careful handling instructions. For example only read hemmingway after two shots of rum. The ideal way to read the books in A Dance to the Music of Time would be to retreat to a cottage, equip oneself with an ever replenishing cup of tea and some sort of exhaustive reference work which would have every character in the book and spend the next month reading every single one in series.In the absence of such preparation I instead go through the same familiar stages of adaptation as I immerse myself in the Powell`s world. First complete confusion as I try and remember who on earth all the different characters are. Second the renewed realization that nothing that in a traditional novel would take center stage will happen at all, and if anything does it is best dismissed much like a rude visitor in one line. Finally the payoff comes as I am finally able to immerse myself in the acerbic worldview of Nick as he is begrudgingly dragged along by other more forceful characters in their entirely random machinations. It is total genius but one that does not give up its joys easily.

When you start a \u201cseries \u201ewhich will go on for twelve installments you wonder if the author will keep up with the intrigue, the suspense or if the plot will lose intensity and you will eventually get bored. At least I did. And there have been some moments when I was reading novel number six, I guess, when it seemed that interest was not at the level of the first two marvelous novels in this extraordinary masterpiece.Books Do Furnish a Room brought back, if ever lost, an acute sense of humor an extraordinary capacity to paint an immense fresco, of the size of the Monet late work in the Orangerie, I think.It is at times beyond my power of concentration or memory size to remember the relationships and the exact place of some characters, which may sound natural, considering that we may be dealing with over one hundred roles in this gigantic play of human spirit, not unlike La Comedie Humaine.We are even introduced to a new character, named X by his lover, the intriguing, attractive and strange Mrs. Widmerpool. Pamela is at the center of a scene taking place at a funeral\u2026I will avoid naming the people who die, partly because I can\u2019t recall them all, except for Stringham and Peter Templer and in part to avoid disclosing anything for a reader who might want to take the plunge. On second thoughts, the latter reason seems flimsy- I don\u2019t see someone trying to read a review of the tenth volume and then embarking on the introduction, unless by mistake or design sprang from an unusual taste, which could then be matched by an odd presentation, like this.Anthony Powell has an astonishing capacity to write with humor, incredible power of observation, a rigor which is even more remarkable given the size of the task- organizing and keeping track of a huge number of characters, over a large number of pages.In the church, at the funeral service, Widmerpool shows up with a retinue which is as odd as the new MP himself- since we last met Kenneth, he has joined the British Parliament and at one later point, even the government. There is Gipsy, Pamela and a number of other companions, who turn what is supposed to be an opportunity to meditate, think of the departed into a scene. On another note, Powell writes about Naturalism, Tolstoy, Anna Karenina in a very interesting way, with some different points of expressed in a dialogue between Nick and X.In an unexpected turn of the story, we met Le Bas, the one and the same who was turned over to the police, about a thousand pages before. Le Bas is now eighty but his judgment seems to be unimpaired- he has a low opinion of the MP Widmerpool, which gives him a lot of credit and an advantage over many of the characters who are so easily fooled by the few positive qualities that Kenneth possesses and are blind to the pure evil that lies within and who has sent Stringham and others to meet their death.A Dance to the Music of Time is a complex, beautiful and very rewarding book. I have only two novels left and I regret having to finish so soon such a great read."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7483415-rob", "userReview": "The title comes from a possibly apocryphal saying ascribed to a rather sodden career journalist who we haven't seen before this book (which is no. 10 of 12). In this not-quite roman a clef cycle, we can't be sure if it was a real-life quote or not. We are now in rationing-era London. Maida Vale is a dump; the pubs are draughty and often empty. The journalist is a red herring; the real new character followed here is the shambolic but talented writer X. Trapnel, based on Julian McLaren-Ross, whom Nick hires to write literary reviews. Alongside him is the voracious Pamela Widmerpool, nee Flitton, introduced in the last book, and her stilted marriage to our roly-poly go-getter.If you've come this far, then you're in it to the end (as I'm sure I've been saying for a few instalments now) but I have to say I really have mixed feelings here. When Powell gets it right - the initial description of Trapnel, the walkout scene, the showdown in the hovel in Maida Vale - it's great. At other times there's a feeling of shoehorning as much lived experience as possible into this structure, which gets a bit stale. This entry is a bit more lively than the plodding spy fare of the last and Powell makes Trapnel work as a character, but his intuitions on Pamela are woefully two-dimensional, and the publishing adventure lacks a narrative arc. Again, Widmerpool, the character used as Powell's revenge on an old boss (he is based on Col. Denis Capel-Dunn), gives us a relentless force of nature, but the political barbs tossed by our supposed boho-Tory Jenkins are pretty anodyne. There is a tantalising glimpse of Sra Flores (as Jean Templer now is), and a great description of her some of her tics, but it goes nowhere. Not yet, at least.So, one step up from the last instalment, but still not recapturing the spark of the earlier novels, although the structure and its comment on faded Empire are well in place.

We meet again many of the recurring characters who have populated the first nine novels of the series and, as always, meet a number of new ones.Books Do Furnish a Room is one of the finest novels in the series, and my favorite so far. Powell had always planned on creating a long-form narrative, attempting to avoid the restrictions imposed by putting an entire plot in 250 pages. In my blog to the first book, A Question of Upbringing, I quoted this excerpt from an interview with Powell from an interview published in Paris review: \u201cWell, this is rather a long story. You see I haven't any great talent for inventing plots, and indeed it seems to me that even the best writers are inclined to churn out the same stuff in eighty thousand words, although it's dressed up in a different way. And so I thought that there would be all sorts of advantages for a writer like myself to write a really long novel in which plots and characters could be developed, which would cover this question of not doing short-term plots\u2014doing rather larger ones, in fact. But of course I didn't know at the beginning quite how long all this was going to be . . . I knew there would be a great number of novels, and about, I suppose, halfway through I realized that I should have to do at least three about the war. Well, having done six before, it seemed the obvious answer to do three to end it up with, because I think it's quite a good idea to have some sort of discipline imposed on yourself in writing, and therefore I deliberately wrote the last three with the idea of ending it up and doing the neat twelve volumes. But I have to admit that in 1951 I didn't know there'd be exactly twelve.\u201d When I started the series, I thought of the novels as being essentially plot-free. There were a lot of beautifully drawn characters all interacting with each other in interesting ways, but there were no moments that seemed to be setting up some future event. Instead, each chapter read as a sort of short story involving multiple characters in a single universe. There is much that is funny and some that is moving, but Powell\u2019s writing and power of observation always made the reading interesting and rewarding. Each novel moves us forward in time, taking us from the narrator\u2019s time at university to, here in book ten, when he is in his early 40\u2019s. Two things make Books Do Furnish a Room particularly enjoyable. First, the novel feels more cohesive in its focus than previous novels in the series. Perhaps I feel that more than in the other novels because I am particularly interested in Books\u2019 focus on writing and publishing. Second, I begin to feel the gathering force of the larger story working towards its conclusion. I don\u2019t expect anything especially dramatic at the climax of the series, but all the characters and relationships have the strength of familiarity and time. Early in the series, it was hard to tell where everything was going. The individual stories were all overlapping in their way, building off each other and calling back to past episodes as different elements moved in and out, vanishing for several chapters or volumes, only to come back in again with extra weight. I had assumed that the four men at the heart of the first novel would be the recurring center of the entire series, but with Stringham and Templer dead (or presumed dead), only Nick and Widmerpool remain. Widmerpool has appeared in every volume and he seems to be the only character with a central arc, having begun as an object of humor and worked his way up to an MP in the government. As Le Bas in the final chapter of the tenth book notes, Widmerpool is the last of Nick\u2019s classmates that anyone expected to achieve so much. As we build to the end of the series, I suspect that Widmerpool has a fall before him.I have observed in past posts what a wonderful narrator Nick is, full of observation and judicious opinions while at the same time possessing such humor and an eye for irony. While the novels are not about him at all, he is a wonderful character whom the reader wants to hang out with as much as everyone else in the novel who insists on his company when it\u2019s available.I also suspected from the beginning that we would watch the world change over the course of the series, and while that is certainly true, the consistency of Nick\u2019s tone makes that change more subtle and gradual than I anticipated. As we move from post-Victorian to post-war England the tone of the world has changed, but Powell avoids over-dramatizing those changes, giving us continuity as well as changes. Certainly the younger generation, represented in Books by Pamela Widmerpool and Trapnel are very different from Nick\u2019s friends, but Nick is hardly shaking his head wondering about the youth of today. The parties that Nick attended in the first movement of the series are a quaint tradition of the past, but there is no bemoaning that absence. Politics have changed too, as Gypsy Jones, Quiggins, and Erry show. But like time itself, the change is so gradual that it feels as natural as life as we live it, drawing more attention to similarities than differences. Whether that was Powell\u2019s intentions, I do not know, but I find it a very interesting effect.I am excited to see how and to what extent all the threads come together, or to follow the metaphor Powell himself sets out in the opening novel, how the dancers conclude their time on the floor and who will still be among them. It is on now to the penultimate book in the series, which has the wonderful title Temporary Kings."}, {"userName": "Ian Brydon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28014642-ian-brydon", "userReview": "This is the tenth volume of Powell's autobiographical epic, \"A Dance to the Music of Time\", and sees his fictional avatar Nick Jenkins return once more to civilian life after his service in the Second World War, as chronicled in [The Valley of Bones], [The Soldier\u2019s Art] and [The Military Philosophers]. However, before resuming his former place in London's literary world, he returns to academia, staying in his old Oxford college while researching the life of Robert Burton, and in particular his classic renaissance volume, [The Anatomy of Melancholy]. There is a certain poignancy about this choice of subject for Nick Jenkins: while [A Dance to the Music of Time] has frequently been praised for its humour and piquant observations of life, beneath the jolly carapace the predominant theme is one of cyclical melancholia.His return to a post-war Oxford offers an opportunity for another encounter with Sillery, one of the principal influences during Jenkins\u2019s time as an undergraduate. Still steeped in his intricate webs of political intrigue and relentless snobbery, underpinned by his particularly delicious form of personal malice, Sillery has been ennobled by the new, post-war Labour administration, and seems agog for any snippets of gossip or speculation about life in London, although his energies are principally directed to editing his journals for publication. Jenkins\u2019s spell in Oxford is cut short by news of the sudden death of his brother in law, the socialist peer Lord Warminster (known to friends and family as Erridge). Erridge\u2019s funeral is one of Powell\u2019s set piece masterpieces, with the Tolland family demonstrating all of their own respective foibles while also having to contend with the unexpected appearance of Kenneth Widmerpool (now an ambitious Labour MP), and his wife, along with J G Quiggin and Gypsy Jones, among others, who had lately been involved with Erridge and, in particular, his plans to fund the launch of a new, left-leaning politico-literary magazine called \u2018Fission\u2019Returned to civilian life and back from his brief hiatus in Oxford, Jenkins now finds himself \"doing the books\" for \u2018Fission\u2019 while also struggling to complete his exegesis of Burton, which will eventually be published under the title 'Borage and Hellebore'. Working for Fission brings Jenkins back into regular contact with J G Quiggin who has now relinquished his own aspirations as an author and taken to publishing. The magazine is edited by Lindsey Bagshaw, known to all his acquaintances as 'Books Do Furnish a Room' Bagshaw, or simply 'Books'. Bagshaw is a veteran journalist and lifelong student of the numerous strains of socialism. Through Bagshaw, Jenkins also makes the acquaintance X Trapnel, a highly accomplished yet dangerously volatile writer who strides around the icy capital in an old RAF greatcoat while brandishing a swordstick. Jenkins was surprised to find that Kenneth Widmerpool, recently appointed as Principal Private Secretary to a member of the Cabinet, was involved with the magazine as one of its financial backers and a regular columnist. In this latter role he churns out wordy pieces espousing the merits of increased cultural and trade links with the Soviet bloc countries. After an inauspicious first encounter with her, Trapnel becomes utterly enchanted by Pamela, Widmerpool's unconventional wife. Pamela has hitherto been a fairly ephemeral character but takes a more prominent role in this volume, leaving her husband to set up home with Trapnel in the dim hinterland of Kilburn. Needless to say, life with Pamela is far from tranquil, which drags Trapnel down, and compromises his health (he has never been physically robust) and his writing. The portrayal of Trapnel is based upon the equally melancholic life of Julian Maclaren-Ross, who promised so much but died regrettably young without ever fulfilling his potential.As Jenkins becomes more deeply immersed in Burton's work he sees ever more characteristics of different forms of melancholia among those people with whom he works, and Trapnel in particular. Trapnel does display a certain style, but is ill-equipped for the vicissitudes of post-war London, and the Dickensian winter that shows no sign or thawing. Often very funny this novel is also very closely observed and offers pellucid insight into the difficulties endured by the professional writer."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce", "userReview": "In this, the tenth and antepenultimate novel in Powell\u2019s magnificent series, \u201cA Dance to the Music of Time,\u201d the narrator, Nick Jenkins, has returned to his writing life after the end of World War II, re-encountering old acquaintances at the University, people who have changed considerably. He comments about \u201cthe relatively high proportion of persons known pretty well at an earlier stage of life, both here and elsewhere, now dead, gone off their rocker, withdrawn into states of existence they - or I - had no wish to share\u2026Some kind of reshuffle has to take place halfway through life\u2026Friends, if required at all in the manner of the past, must largely be reassembled at about this milestone. The changeover might improve consistency, even quality, but certainly lost in intimacy.\u201d He learns that the ever irrepressible Widmerpool has been elected a Member of Parliament and that his own wife Isobel\u2019s brother, Erridge, has just died unexpectedly.In many ways, this particular novel seems to be a kind of summing up, a bringing of the reader up to date with characters from the entire series, characters that had become lost during the books dealing with Nick\u2019s involvement in the war. Now we are learning the toll that the passing years have taken on relationships, the variety of paths that familiar friends and relatives have taken, and how the years have altered the aspirations and perspectives of them all. In many cases, we are now dealing with children and grandchildren of some of the characters in the earlier novels, each having a unique history and familial legacy to carry forward.The series as a whole deals with artistic creativity, and this particular novel delves deeply into the field of publishing, Nick for a time having a role in a group attempting to establish a new literary magazine; it was interesting to experience the roles of different personalities on the decisions made. Finally, however, one is most captivated by the continuing story of human interactions and psychological motivations, the vagaries of chance and intention, the rise and fall of individual destinies. Widmerpool remains as enigmatic as ever, a unique and strange character, while Nick himself is always the acute observer, the view of this fascinating world being through his eyes alone."}, {"userName": "Glen Engel-Cox", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1028300-glen-engel-cox", "userReview": "I'm into the home stretch of Powell's Top 100 Modern novel series (in a sense, like Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings,\" this series by Powell is a meta-novel; unlike Tolkien, however, Powell was the one to split his sections into separate books), and it is gaining momentum, mainly because of the inertia gained from having placed this much of a time investment into the series. The title of this novel has to be my favorite, and the anecdote within the book from which it comes is quite amusing--a character receives the nickname Books for his statement, upon entering the library of a home in which he is about to commit an adulterous act with the wife of a prominent book person that \"books do furnish a room.\" This kind of droll, understated, and somewhat dark humor is indicative of Powell's series.This picks up in the aftermath of World War II, as Jenkins and his friends attempt to return to life as civilians. Jenkins becomes the book review editor for a magazine that was endowed by his brother-in-law, Erry, and is also supported by Widmerpool, newly elected MP. Jenkins is fascinated with the novelist X. Trapnel, a strange free spirit of words who is constantly in debt and quite deft with \"the touch\" (i.e., borrowing from friends and acquaintances), yet who can follow up a touch with the offer of buying a beer for the person from whom he just borrowed a quid. Trapnel finds himself entranced by Pamela Widmerpool, but, as readers of the previous book should know, this is doomed to be disadvantageous to everyone involved but Pamela herself.The description of how a small literary magazine was run in the post-war era is quite interesting, and unfortunately put in the background as Powell features the actions of the characters. Jenkins sees the magazine as a job, and his interest, as always, is in the gossip that can be provided by the changing of partners in this complex dance of life. Maybe I'm just a wallflower, who finds more beauty in the decorations than in just who is dancing with who on the floor. However, midnight is drawing near on the dance, and most couples are, as Molly Ivins would say, \"dancing with the one what brung ya.\" It will be amusing to see if there are any coaches turning into pumpkins in the last two books."}, {"userName": "Lars Guthrie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie", "userReview": "Number ten in the twelve-volume 'Dance to the Music of Time.' As I approach the end, I feel relief and accomplishment, as well as regret. In 'Books Do Furnish a Room,' World War II is finally over, and to this reader it feels like a weight has been lifted off Powell, as his narrator, Jenkins, can now return to old haunts and those friends and acquaintances who are still alive. This despite a London suffering through an economically depressed post-war funk. The major new character here, X. Trapnel, an outlandish 'naturalistic' author, makes for far more engagement than the parade of military men marching through the past couple of volumes. Also the vampiric Pamela Wimerpool (nee Flitton) is allowed to take up a bit more of the stage. We don't learn as much about her as about what she does to men, though--mainly Widmerpool and Trapnel. As I near the end of the work, I am more and more interested in what is not in Powell's novels, and women are not really always there, but often inhabit a mysterious parallel world. Pamela seems to be the ultimate Mata Hari figure. Nick Jenkins's rather witty wife, who rarely appears, seems to be the sole example of a practical and down-to-earth woman. And that brings up the fact that Jenkins himself is rather a cipher. In 'Books,' his family grows by one but we don't learn much more about them than a daughter's sickness preventing his wife from attending a party, and 'some arrangement about a son going to school' allowing for another random encounter with the irrepressible Widmerpool (who is the glue that holds 'Dance' together). We learn more about the subject of the book Jenkins is working on, Robert Burton, author of 'The Anatomy of Melancholy' (a very interesting subject, to be certain) than the members of his immediate family.

It opens in the winter of 1945/46 as Britain settles back into peacetime, though not without annoying rationing and shortages. Jenkins has come to his old university for research towards a biography on Robert Burton, but soon first himself involved in the launch of a new literary magazine with distinct leftist tones. Indeed, we return to a world of shady politics left behind in the early 1930s in THE ACCEPTANCE WORLD, the third novel of the sequence, and many of the characters from those days return. Widmerpool, his political career now taking off, also comes into the picture, and his continual defence of the Soviet Union makes him a more repulsive antagonist than ever.But beyond revisiting old friends, BOOKS DO FURNISH A ROOM introduces two new characters with very distinctive personalities. One is the novelist X. Trapnel, whose bohemianism mystifies his fellow characters and ultimately leads to his grisly ruin. The other character is Pamela Widmerpool. Though she appeared first in the previous novel, she was mostly a force of nature destroying the lives of numerous male characters offscreen. Here Jenkins talks with her on several occasions, revealing something of her as a person. As this volume was written at the end of the 1960s in a more frank era, Powell felt that his language could be a bit more coarse, and it is Pamela who utters all the profanity. The relationship between Widmerpool and his wife sometimes descends into mere soap opera, and the literary allusions, especially to Burton, get rather tiresome. So, this isn't among the best novels in the Dance. Still, I enjoyed this novel, especially the diary-like chronicles of life in a postwar literary magazine, and I look forward to continuing with the Dance."}, {"userName": "Arukiyomi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/161559-arukiyomi", "userReview": "By quite a margin, I found this to be the most readable of the entire series of volumes so far. This is because Powell develops a number of minor characters into major ones, most notably in this volume Pamela nee Flitton and X Trapnel the esoteric author whose lifestyle forms a major theme.And not only does Powell develop these characters as individuals in their own right, he arranges a number of quite memorable scenes in which their characters come to the fore. Through these, as we have come to expect, Widmerpool blunders in his usual socially reckless manner. It all makes for a quick episode.The era is post war and the characters are trying to figure out how to get back to normal. Jenkins returns to university and eventually ends up working as an editor for a new literary review which is the backdrop for Powell\u2019s continuing fascination with cultural hoi polloi (or, just to show howcultured I am, should that be hoy polloy. I forget.)Although this exploration of art, literature and the like is, overall, the one major common theme of the entire series of 12 volumes, Powell does not leave the reader with only that to trawl through for pithy statements regarding life, the universe and everything. Rather, he sets up some well-crafted conflicts between the characters of Widmerpool, Pamela and X Trapnel who get involved in a sort of hate-triangle.There\u2019s also an amusing incident with a Chinese urn.I enjoyed this one and it\u2019s a good thing too.
