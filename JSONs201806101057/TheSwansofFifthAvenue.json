This is one of those books. I found this book so saccharine, so gushing, so star struck that it was barely readable to me. I almost made an appointment for the dentist as my teeth ached from so much sweetness. I can not tell you how much this book left me cold and it was only seventy five pages near the end that saved it as an one star for me. Let me be clear. I have read this author before and like her. I am truly disappointed. The story centers around Truman Capote and Babe Paley's friendship in the late 1950's/early 1960's. It is full of stories of the famous rich and famous of that time period like C.Z. Guest, Pam Churchill, Diana Vreeland and even appearances from Betty Bacall and Jackie Kennedy. They were Truman's swans who found him so amusing. He gossiped with them, flattered them and became their pet. he participated in their parties, stayed in their houses and shared their secrets. Frankly I did not find them interesting at all. Their lives seemed so boring to me. It consisted of lunching, shopping and keeping themselves in perfect shape. They were bored out of their minds and looking for a diversion when Capote stumbled into their lives and they all adored him. It gives you a pictures of the privileges they seemingly enjoyed but it also lays out the high price they paid for it. Their subservience to men so they could stay married to the money was just horrifying. It is terrible to envision the beautiful and stylish Babe Pauley rub her husband's feet and keeping her make-up on all night so he could never see her face bare. Shudder. Here are some examples of the gushing writing. \"She (Babe) was a princess, a walking fairy tale.\" Truman says, \"You simply can't understand how glorious they were, those girls!\" Truman's supposedly last thoughts, \"The splendor of belonging, being included, prized, coveted. The beauty of a perfectly tailored shirt, crisp, blinding white, just out of a box. The beauty of taffeta, the tinkling of bells, diamonds, emeralds, a pristine paper flower. Beauty.\" If you are interested in the lives of the rich and famous who fill their days with shopping, eating, caring for their bodies and faces, partying and not much else then this book could be the one for you. I'm not so it wasn't the books for me."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9420458-jennifer", "userReview": "Tell me -- What is your greatest fear?There was a long silence. No sounds but the low hum of the pool filter, the faraway grazing of a lawn mower, and the determined \"clip clip\" of a gardener on the other side of some tall azalea bushes, trimming away.\"That someone will see,\" Babe whispered, while at the same time, Truman murmured, \"That someone will find me out.\"\"That no one will love me,\" Truman added after another moment. While at the same time, Babe admitted, \"And that I'll never be loved, truly.\" In her latest novel, Melanie Benjamin peeks behind the curtain of the famous friendships (and infamous exploits) of Truman Capote and his \"Swans\" -- the best-known New York socialites of the early and mid 1960's, including Babe Paley, Slim Keith and others. For years Capote and his Swans, particularly Babe, were inseparable, until Capote published a scathing short fiction piece in Esquire magazine that was a thinly-disguised portrait of the most embarrassing aspect of the Swans' lives. After publication, a schism developed between Capote and the group, and he was ostracized from their circle for good. I found this book to be fascinating. On one level, it could just be read as a story of the glitterati gallivanting around the big city (and the world) doing nothing more than spending money and being \"fabulous.\" But I looked at it as more as a character study -- both of the individuals involved and of personality types in general -- and a tale of love and friendship.I know a bit about Truman Capote, but I haven't read about him extensively or seen any of the biopics about his life. Benjamin describes for us a man who is simultaneously overconfident about his talent and importance, yet still desperately longing for approval and acceptance. \"If he only told the best stories, dished the most delicious gossip, dropped the grandest of names.Then, perhaps. Then. Would he truly belong?\"Why would Capote, who seemed to find pure (though platonic) love with Babe Paley, turn around and betray her in such a public way? Was it hubris? Did he think that they were so close she'd forgive him? Did he think he was so smart that no one would know who he was writing about? I don't know. It's a question as old as time -- why does any friend betray another?I knew nothing about the famous 1960's socialites, but their worries and concerns are the same the world over, particularly for women obsessed with beauty, who think they're going to be \"traded in\" for a newer model when their husbands get bored.\"Blond, brunette, tall, short, European or Californian, they were still the same; only the exteriors were different. And they devoted their lives to maintaining this difference, striving to shine, be the one jewel who stood out. Yet at night, they took off the diamonds, and gowns and went to empty beds resigned to the fact that they were just women, after all.

I have always been fascinated with this era; New York in the 60s; the fashion, the art, and the people....and the story of Babe and Truman. (I love stories about complicated relationships.) Years ago I had read parts of La C\u00f4te Basque, 1965, so I was somewhat familiar with the background of the story. While reading this book, I spent hours reading about the lives of the other women in Truman Capote's life, (some that were just barely mentioned in this book), the Paleys, their apartments, the art they owned, looking at images from the famous Black and White Ball, and more! I found myself wishing I had a Mr. Kenneth hairstyle and a cute little Pucci dress! (I may have even teased my hair a little while reading:)The Swans of Fifth Avenue is so well written and intriguing, especially knowing much of it is based on real facts. It's an unusual story about a love between two so seemingly different people who are, at the core, so alike; two \"lonely, damaged souls...so vulnerable and naked in every way that matter.\" (one of the last lines in the book that described the relationship between Babe Paley and Truman Capote perfectly.)"}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947323-dianne", "userReview": "I was in the mood for something light and fun and gossipy and this book was certainly those things. The cast of characters include William and Babe Paley, Truman Capote, Diana Vreeland, CZ Guest, Gloria Guiness, Pamela Churchill and tons of other heirs and heiresses and celebreties. But - the writing was almost childish and full of vapid psychological musings. OK, maybe a bit harsh....I did enoy the re-creation of high society New York in the 50's and 60's and the lifestyles of the rich and famous. I just couldn't get past the hammy writing.If you are looking for something similar in topic, allow me to recommend Dominick Dunne - \"The Two Mrs. Grenvilles\" (tells the story of Ann Woodward, a character in \"Swans of Fifth Avenue\"), \"An Inconvenient Woman,\" and \"People Like Us.\" Several of these books have a thinly disguised Truman Capote character. His books are great fun to read and have really good writing.

Filled with tales about Truman himself and his beloved swans, the society women who were his best friends, this book is a delicious, delectable foray into their dirty little secrets. The women tell Truman things they don't even tell each other or their husbands, because their trust in Truman is implicit. But after the success of In Cold Blood and Truman's \"Party of the Century,\" he changed. He turned to vodka and drugs and grew lazy, more concerned about his image than with his writing. He finally wrote about what he knew best, his swans-- friendship be damned--because they made for good stories. He and Babe Paley were the closest of them all, so the reader wonders if at least the two of them will patch things before it's too late.I remember very well watching Truman make the talk show circuit back when I was a pre-teen. He was so flamboyant and outlandish, nothing about him seemed geniune. I felt the same here. His friendships and the trust they demanded were tested, and he gets a failing grade. He didn't know love as a child and so as an adult his conception of love was skewed. Maybe with Babe he struck gold, but then he risked even that.I was quite taken with the first half of this book, but in the second half I felt the portrayal of Truman's personality gradually enervated the enjoyment factor. The author still managed to turned some of the vinegar into champagne, so for that I give her points.

Sophia CoppolaI found this book utterly fascinating, every time I picked it up I found myself completely submerged in this ephemeral world. Even though I knew of the Swans individually, I\u2019d never heard of them referred to en masse, unaware they were part of the same circle and missed the Capote angle. I\u2019d certainly never heard about the literary scandal. Like the author, my vague memory of Truman Capote growing up was of a bloated caricature of an alcoholic, he seemed mean-spirited with too much self regard, I had no knowledge of the man before his descent. Babe Paley was known to me only as one of the beautiful people.Beyond the glittering world and the scandalous tales of high society, this is a story about a friendship, an unconventional love affair between Truman Capote and Babe Paley. Each of these central characters shares their version of that union set amidst the glitz and glamour of a culture all but gone today and offers a cautionary tale of entrusting one\u2019s secrets to someone who might not be worthy. Beware the storytellers, the story they might tell is your own.On the whole, though, this is a highly entertaining tale, its narrative structure going back and forth in time and offering us private and public moments of both comedy and tragedy. The comedic elements are imaginatively rendered as gossipy bits, almost as if we\u2019re eavesdropping. For instance, as the book opens we are privy to a gathering of Swans as they try to distance themselves from Capote after the scandal, then cut to the next chapter, many years earlier, they\u2019re all vying to crown themselves the one who discovered Truman. I love when an author finds a way to expose an understood reality, the lies we tell ourselves and others.In an interview, Melanie Benjamin remarked that she is \u2018drawn to people whose public stories are fairly well known, but whose private lives seem to indicate that there was a lot more going on that we didn't know about or learn about. The liars of history, in other words.\u2019 And that\u2019s what stood out the most to me about this story, the sordid pasts, the hidden truths and the masks that people wear to hide what cannot be shared.This is one of those books that just begs for more research. Throughout the reading I continually searched these names to have a more vivid image and now after finishing the novel, I cannot seem to stop myself from continuing my search. I really hated leaving this fantastical world, this is my favorite kind of reading where I am transported to another place, another time and populated with characters that I don\u2019t always like, but who intrigue me all the same. It\u2019s not for everyone and if you can\u2019t get past the lives of the rich and (in)famous mantle, then this won\u2019t be your particular brand of reading.

I was looking for a book that would be entertaining and not too difficult for my vacation read, well mostly airplane read! I made a great choice.Of course I had read Truman Capote\u2019s books \u201cIn Cold Blood\u201d and \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d and saw the movie of that book many times. Neither my mom nor I ever really followed any of the rich and fabulous but that was all the more reason why I really enjoyed this novel.The story begins at the end and is told backwards in time. I had never heard of the \u201cswans\u201d of this era but enjoyed their stories and their relationships. As with most Hollywood stars we seldom hear of their real lives and how sad and sordid those lives could be. We like to believe in the fantasy world that they portray and forget that they are just human beings like everyone else. Wealth and being famous can certainly change a person particularly if it happens suddenly. Then there are those who have been privileged their entire life. I think the saddest of the women are the \u201ctrophy\u201d wives who existed to make their husband\u2019s lives, sometimes rich industrialists, sometime the privileged super rich, look and feel effortless. I think that Ms. Benjamin really wrote an honest, although fictionalized, version of Mr. Capote and the \u201cswans\u201d. The story of Hollywood in the 50\u2019s and those people who inhabited it, Babe Paley, Pamela Churchill, Gloria Guinness to name just some and those that they worked with, tried very hard to maintain the illusion of themselves that they wanted the public to know. I loved reading the descriptions of the parties and luncheons and just all of the scenes in the book that took place in the 50\u2019s.

Both did an excellent job at mimicking Truman Capote\u2019s drawl, lisp and voice. I listened to Capote on YouTube to confirm if the intonations were correct renderings or perhaps exaggerations. I am satisfied that they both captured the lilt of the characters\u2019 true voices. The chapters are split between the different narrators rather than having Campbell read the females and Boehmer the males. The speed was easy to follow and the voices felt utterly genuine. I feel the narration deserves five stars. The book I give four. I separate the two ratings. While I listened I had a nagging doubt, \u201cIs all that I am being told really true?\u201d After checking internet I became convinced. I feel the author has done a tremendous job assimilating all the known facts. It is she that has added fictional dialog. Before reading the book I knew very little about the central characters: Truman Capote, Babe Cushing Mortimer Paley and her husband William S. Paley (the founder of CBS), Nancy \u201cSlim\u201d Keith, Gloria Guinness, Lucy Douglas \"C. Z.\" Guest, Marella Agnelli and Jack Dunphy (Capote\u2019s long time lover). All of them have photos and in-depth articles on them on the net. These women were the high society dames of NYC in the 50s, the \u201cSwans of Fifth Avenue\u201d. All ultra-wealthy, all attractive, all the cream of the crop, the pace-setters. Most promiscuous. So if reading about the elite draws you, then this is a must read. The book is well-researched. Of course, if you want to know about Capote, this is another reason to read the book. It is this that drew me. This is one of those books that you finish wondering if it wouldn\u2019t have been more pleasant to not know the truth. The truth is ugly.So you learn about New York high society in the 50s and you learn about the above people\u2019s lives all the way through to their deaths. You learn about why Babe and Truman Capote became such close friends. What was it in them that drew them to each other? The author believes she understands, and her reasoning is definitely convincing. The change in Capote after his magnificent Black and White Ball at the Plaza Hotel in 1967 is important too. All of his books are discussed, and how they relate to his life. There is an author\u2019s note at the end that says exactly what is fact and what fiction.

The design, the illustration, the product and its nuances can be extraordinarily beautiful. Those who employ fashion artfully, in their personal style, in their wardrobes and toilette, their environments and decoration manifest a form of creativity that has had an ageless appeal. \"The Swans of Fifth Avenue\" were five such outstanding women, notable in the 1950's and early 1960's, for their impeccable taste, beauty, manners and knowledge of that era's social etiquette. In the 1950's and early 60's, women were very restricted financially to become successful in their own right. Banks would not approve credit unless a husband co-signed; married women were looked down on if they worked. Successful marriages were the ways and means to improve one's circumstances, which had been the case for eons. Success also was found in marriage to the \"right\" people, the heirs of fortunes made in the 1800's, the descendants of Peter Stuyvesant who first settled New York, the wealthy relations of the Gilded Age of America who danced at Mary Astor's balls or whose lineage could be traced to those American debutantes who funded crumbling British gentry's estates through marriage in the early 1900\u2019s. Slim Keith and Gloria Guinness began their lives in modest circumstances, and ambitiously climbed up the social ladder into New York's elite. C.Z. Guest had impeccable Boston Brahmin ancestry and after a short period of being a wild child (which included posing nude for Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo's lover, in Mexico), she returned to marry within her wealthy pedigreed W.A.S.P. class. Pamela Churchill had been married to Winston Churchill's son and was British gentry, with a formidable and famous libido, many lovers and a railway heir husband who would lead her to eventually utilize her charm in Washington on Clinton's campaign. But it was Babe Paley, daughter of Boston Brahmin stock Dr. Harvey Cushing, famed neurosurgeon and wife of William Paley, founder of CBS TV, whom was considered to be \"perfect\" by Truman Capote, in the close friendship with her and the others where he deemed them \"the swans\". (Her first marriage was to Stanley Mortimer Jr., heir to Standard Oil. Lee Radziwill and Jacqueline Kennedy's mother's second marriage was to a partner in the same enterprise.) The novel follows the blossoming friendship, interspersed with the disastrous, socially moronic actions of Capote in submitting heartfelt confidences as a bitchy article to Esquire. Capote was fascinated by the exclusiveness of this wealthy enclave and dreamed about being part of it. He saw himself as a literary genius, that one of his books would open all doors for him and he would be an equal, if not superior to this clique. He nurtured friendships, but most had an element of sharing gossip from one to another, as if they all were a creation of his imagination rather than real people. The \"swans\" try to survive in their hostile upper crust society where women are replaceable; they age, support each other, are superficially cynical and have to work at remaining relevant. Truman Capote doesn't get it. He doesn't understand the connection of family, the history of others before him, the need to \"save face\" for that family and the friendships which likely have some branch on a family tree. \"Oh, Truman! The little devil. ...Dammit. C.Z. still liked Truman... But he had gone off the rails, rather. He'd always been charming, amusing, gossipy, but never downright bitchy. His self-importance, his astounding self-confidence, had been benign. .... This bitchy little story...had murdered one of her tribe, if all of the gossip was to be trusted. He didn't have the breeding, the pedigree. He wasn't a thoroughbred. It was a damn shame, but there it was.\"3.5 stars. I liked learning about this piece of Americana. I was not familiar with the story of the swans. I knew a little about Babe Paley. The part which boggled my mind was the \"pedigree\" which these people share.

Secrets betrayed and lives destroyed. By the viper in their nest; the storyteller in their midst.\"In the mid-1960's, Truman Capote was at the height of his talent and his fame. He had published In Cold Blood, which would be the most successful work of his career; and he had firmly established himself within the upper crust of New York society. Rich, stylish, bored women invited him to their vacation homes and yachts and private planes; in return, Capote amused them by telling them fabricated stories about his childhood in Alabama, and by being scandalous and extravagant (see - his Black and White ball in 1966, where society immediately became divided into who had received an invitation and who hadn't). And then, in 1975, Capote published a short story called \"La Cote Basque, 1965.\" In what was intended to be an excerpt from a book he never finished, Capote revealed every scandal and secret that he'd learned in his years in the inner circle. His rich friends effectively disowned him for the betrayal, and Capote was ruined. His career never recovered. The Swans of Fifth Avenue jumps around in time, opening with the aged \"swans\" gathering in the infamous restaurant to strategize after Capote's scandalous story comes out, and Melanie Benjamin also takes us through Capote's rise and fall in New York society. Although she shows us Capote's interactions with a handful of influential society women, she focuses primarily on Capote's relationship with Babe Paley, who was likely the most betrayed by the publication of his story. (to Truman Capote's credit - at least he wrote about these women's private lives using pseudonyms. Melanie Benjamin doesn't bother to do this, possibly because the proverbial cat is already out of the bag, thanks to Capote's original story)If you view literature about the Secret Lives of Rich People as a spectrum, The Swans of Fifth Avenue would be placed closer to Gossip Girl than The Age of Innocence. Which is not necessarily a criticism - Gossip Girl is a delightful trash heap and I love it, but Cecily Von WhateverFace is no Edith Wharton and never will be. Ultimately, your enjoyment of Swans of Fifth Avenue will depend on how much you enjoy novels that can be summarized as \"Look! Rich people!\" It's light, fluffy fun that never says anything particularly new or innovative (What's that? Obscenely rich white women should be pitied because they're kept down by society?

The story begins at the end (so no spoilers here) and moves backwards to tell the stories of the \"swans\"-these original trophy wives and fabulously wealthy socialites and their ultimately shallow, lonely lives. In particular, she focuses on Babe Paley, the kindest and most famous of the swans and the one closest to Capote. Babe trusted Capote the most, he seemed to love her the most dearly, and she was, of course, the most hurt by his depiction of her, her marriage, her deepest secrets.The book is a fascinating, delightful read. I was least comfortable with the italicized portions at the beginning and end, with its semi-lyrical, almost fairy tale descriptions of the swans. But the rest of the book was terrific. I couldn't put it down, it was like being inside the events I'd read about. And although the story has no surprises (even if you are unaware of the events, everything is revealed early on) it is well-told. I felt like a child hearing a bedtime story: all I wanted to say was \"more please\" and \"don't stop.\"I am so happy to have been given this book by NetGalley. I loved it: it was like taking a vacation into another world. It's gossipy and fun and although the lives at times are sad, the book is not. It might be a weakness of the author's or, more likely, of my own that the pain of the characters did not touch me deeply but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's like reading a popular magazine article that is exceptionally well done and detailed. Or maybe a kind of fairy tale, dressed in the New York clothes of the 1950's and 60's, with a kind of moral at the end. Anyway, it's great entertainment."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie", "userReview": "This is my second book by Melanie Benjamin and like the other, I absolutely loved it! I knew of Truman Capote and that he had written \"In Cold Blood\" and that he was a strange looking thing that sort of talked funny as I had seen him on the talk shows growing up. I remember him clapping his hands and sitting on his feet all excited about the story he was telling. I never knew about his swans and the book that he wrote about them.What I loved most about this book was googling those women and seeing their images. It gave me a real connection to the characters like I have never had. I even saw the picture of Penelope Tree (whom I had never heard of) in her black and white ball attire. If those women freaked about that showing of midriff, they could not even prepare for what was to come. HA!!!Of course, that does not take away anything from the author and the conversations that she imagined and shared with us. The characters were already developed before I decided \"Hey, I can look these women up on Google\". What a fascinating story of a poor man who makes it rich and still isn't happy and a rich girl who has everything and still isn't happy until they both come together. However, due to their lives and human makeup, they would never be together. It was an ecstatic, slow and moving journey to the top and a short, crashing journey to the bottom.The book was an absolute gem even without the characters being famous, it would have been a great story. The fact that it was true only makes it that much sadder. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. While I had to put it down to put up Christmas decorations, I was thinking the whole time that I could not wait to get back to it. The wait was two days too long, but worth it when I made it back.I highly recommend this book. Written during an era when a big change was coming to America, the swans were some of the last of their breed. Reading how the author shows us how the world was and how it was becoming through their eyes held my interest throughout and totally entertained me along the way. Huge thanks to Random House/Ballantine and Net Galley for approving me to receive a free e-galley in exchange for an honest review. I loved this book!

Best of both worlds--digital and print.  Top 50 Books of 2016!When you think of Melanie Benjamin\u2019s writing, and her spectacular historical novels which come alive with rich characters\u2014reminiscent of past eras, as THE SWANS OF FIFTH AVENUE, representative of Timeless Elegance. Classic. Society. Glamour. Passion. Elite. Literary. Cultured. Flawless. Sophisticated. Vintage. Stylish. . . . And often S C A N D A L O U S !A literary scandal.  Truman had divulged secrets. He called it literature. His friends had shunned him. He died. A cautionary tale.  Social suicide.However, what happened in \"between the lines?\"  The author peels back the layers. The exquisite swan, Babe with the grotesque Truman. Why? She explores what happened between Truman and Babe. This is the story the author so elegantly tells, an inspiring blend of fact with fiction. \u201cWhat happened to Truman Capote and his swans? What happened to elegance. What truly was the price they paid for the lives they lived? For there is always a price. Especially in fairy tales.\u201dSet in the dazzling world  of the elite in the 1950s and 1960s, meet the alluring socialite \u201cSwans\u201d: Babe Paley, Slim Keith, C.Z. Guest, Gloria Guinness, and Pamela Churchill-- New York society. Babe Paley, the stunningly beautiful socialite befriends literary Truman Capote and introduces him to her friends. Gaining insights into the lives of Manhattan\u2019s elite and influential \u2013their secrets, scandals, and hidden desires. Truman Capote soon became known as the darling of an inner circle he called his \"swans.\"Babe is married  to a high-profile husband, wife of CBS president William S. Paley, a beautiful home, wealthy, jewels, travel, and influence, social circles, and all which come with the lifestyle. However, she is lonely and wants love\u2026. Truman is available.Truman was obsessed not so much with money, as he was by many of those who have it. The stylish rich. Women delighted him, and he pleasured them in every way but one\u2014the physical act of love. He is adored by the swans. They enjoyed his company, as much as he enjoyed theirs. He admired all of his swans, but the one who captured his head and heart were in some ways, the loveliest of all.However, in 1975, the dear friends and Manhattan socialites discover the literary lion Truman Capote has betrayed them, revealing their dirtiest secrets, to the world in a story published to great fanfare in Esquire.The latest issue had hit the stands, the cover profile picture of a fat and pasty-looking Truman Capote, the headline trumpeting the acclaimed author of, In Cold Blood\u2019s newest, hotly anticipated short story. \u201cLa Cote Basque 1965,\u201d it was called. The murder Capote had committed, by telling the stories he had told. Stories he had no right to tell. Stories they never should have told him in the first place. Lunch at La Cote Basque  was not for soul-searching. Now they are seeing their exclusive, privileged, envied set-eviscerated, skin flayed open, souls laid bare, ugliness, acknowledged. Secrets betrayed and live destroyed. By the viper in their nest; the storyteller in their midst. Now the four are trying to recall how the southern-fried bastard arrived here in the first place. The story of how Truman came to betray all his swans\u2014one especially. The one they all loved. The one he loved. I have always read in Vanity Fair and other writings: \"Of all Truman\u2019s writing, \u201cLa C\u00f4te Basque\u201d is probably the one piece that can be called a tour de force: he has transformed a table in a Manhattan restaurant into a stage on which he has placed his own jet-set Vanity Fair.\" But Truman had more than literature in mind when he wrote \u201cLa C\u00f4te Basque.\u201d He also used it to get back at some of his rich friends who, for one reason or another, had offended him over the years.A fabulous account  and reenactment \u2013the author\u2019s view of these mythological creatures. Best of all Benjamin outlines the fact and the fiction; where she took leeway and stretched the imaginations. A large portion was factual with some liberties-- expanding the emotions, motivations, and intent. What I absolutely LOVED was the author\u2019s note. When a reader invests their time reading, blogging and reviewing\u2014AND the time, research, and effort \u2013heart and soul --an author pours into creating a novel---to learn what inspired a writing-- is always a special gift and an added bonus, to further enhance the overall reading experience. You always wonder the why, how, when? Why choose certain time periods to explore, or subjects? I can envision Benjamin as a girl with her Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, drawing her into the world of glamor and sophistication. City lights. I had to laugh about the parent's view of city life and its dangers (sounded like mine). I enjoyed hearing her story, the beautiful images, clothes which were exquisite and unattainable. Fashion\u2014fantasizing about the people and the places. Her passion and enthusiasm are reflective throughout the pages, as the characters come alive. The spark-- there is always more to the story. A story within a story. Well-researched. Engrossing. Priceless! No one can re-tell it like the storyteller, Melanie Benjamin. Loved the Palm Beach portions (Oct 1975), of course; as C.Z. recalls Truman\u2014when he stopped being Truman. The gay, gossipy little friend, arm candy, pocket change, was another creature entirely. A giant, a literary sentinel. His greatest achievement to his greatest failure. A chic sophisticated front cover, beautifully packaged, compelling--exquisitely written, Deserving of 5 Swans.  (5 Stars)The Swans of Fifth Avenue  is set in a glittering fairyland\u2014Manhattan in the 1950s and 1960s. This is the Manhattan of The Plaza, Tiffany's, Bergdorf's; the playground of Truman Capote and his Swans.  Revisit the past, follow in the footsteps of The Swans  with Melanie Benjamin.

I\u2019ve always admired his intelligence. I knew he lived a flamboyant life and hobnobbed with celebrities, but I had never been interested in that part of Capote. When I first heard of this book, I was intrigued, though, especially as I wasn\u2019t very familiar with the scandal associated with his short story, \u201cLa Cote Basque 1965\u201d.I was a bit put off at the beginning with Truman constantly falling all over the \u201cswans\u201d (socialites) and constantly telling them how beautiful they were. But then I really got into the book and it was quite an interesting journey. The author did a good job of portraying these real people and their privileged lives and the price they sometimes paid for it. She also was able to aptly show Capote\u2019s fascination with the rich and famous and his contempt for them. For those of you who are not familiar with the actual story of these people and their relationships, I won\u2019t go into any details. I do believe the author did her research and consistently kept true to what is known to be fact about these people during this time period. I\u2019ve been discouraged with some of the historical novels involving real people that I\u2019ve recently read that seemed to be trending towards being filled with imagination and little factual basis. That\u2019s not the case with this book. Plus the author was very clear in her comments after the book about what was true and what wasn't, which I found to be very helpful and aboveboard. Even though there\u2019s a lot of emphasis on the lives of the rich and privileged and that can all be quite grating and boring to read, I think the author pulls it all together towards the end when things start to fall apart in those perfect worlds. This certainly isn\u2019t a literary work on the caliber of Capote\u2019s work but it\u2019s entertaining. It will spike your interest in these people and if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll be hitting the internet numerous times throughout the reading of the book to look for more information about Capote\u2019s swans.This book was given to me by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16909720-abby", "userReview": "This book was provided to me free from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Why do I keep getting accepted for the worst Netgalley books?

The Swans and the watering holes are all quite familiar. The basis of this very pitiful and sad story are facts I witnessed. The rest is the authors speculation - but I suspect it is on the money. Paley's adoration of Truman may or may not have been as intense - but I do believe it was real. Capote was like a playtoy for the swans but he played them even better. The vast amounts of money and style ring so true - In the early 70's you could not miss the Ladies Who Lunched if you were in midtown. Or if you read WWD or Vogue or gossip columns. This was their chosen life and they played their parts well. Think of their serial marriages as changing jobs. I don't think of them as exactly \"role models\" but to a certain echelon they were exactly that. I wound up in horse and dog country and saw it there as well. And the temptation to follow suit was a carrot dangled in front of many. When I did marry and found my own pedestrian name in the Social Register of 1966 (whilst on the john) I thought I would lose my mind. And of my arriviste classmates - I was the only one who got there. No longer alas (is there still a social register?). No one ever said a word about it to me. It was never mentioned before or during the brief marriage - but to be honest - it tickled me. However the book Ms. Benjamin wrote (so well) was fact filled on so many levels. And cliques of these \"grande dames\" existed all over NYC, LI and points north. The right schools, the right dances, the right clothes all attained the \"right husband\". Repeatedly. Truman? Truman was a narcissist and a gay man in a time when it was a very difficult place to be as a person. His choices with his swans was self-serving and beneficial to him and as a writer - he was incredible. Every book; every story. But flawed - like his swans and so needy. As an observer (well past the Social Register moment) -I recognized as late Cole Porter creations and very joyless. Gossip is lots of fun but it can turn quickly to venom; as it did for Truman. I have read the other versions of this same story and answered prayers are indeed not always the ones you really want to appear. Did he betray them? Of course. But they betrayed themselves and in their need for adoration - allowed an angry, talented, deeply scarred little man to hang their laundry out for their world to see. Had he always had the end in mind? That will always be the mystery - left in the end at La Cote Basque 1975.

Perhaps it is the function of the great narrators in the audio version, but I loved it.

However when the author described the voracious Bill Paley (an ultimate outsider) realizing that radio was an antidote to people's loneliness (creating CBS) I felt there was something deeper going on. To this day social media gives us the same sense of connection and yet the same haunting sense of alone-ness. Each character was a beautiful person, but love and connection was elusive.
