I had previously experimented with and enjoyed POTter on 3 different occasions, but could easily have walked away and never touched the stuff again. Then, under some pressure from some POTterHEAD peers of mine, I tried the newest blend called the Goblet...and everything changed. As the warm, easy, potato chip prose crossed my blood-brain barrier, euphoria ensued. My inner child was smitten. I...was...hooked and I...was...happy. Ignore the so-called \"experts\" who say POTter is brain cell killing pap. Don\u2019t listen to those jaded, book snobby squares. Most of them are wound so tight they wouldn\u2019t know a good book if it sat on their face and wriggled. POTter makes you feel good. POTter makes you smile. POTter makes you joyous and giggly. Hell, POTter makes you want to use the word giggly. POTter is enjoyable and fun. That's enough for me. So what made  the Goblet so much more addicting than the rest of the POTter I had tried. Part of it was that I had already seen the movies (up through Order of the Phoenix) before I got my hands on genuine POTter. The first 3 were fun but I felt like I had already \"been there done that\" as they were pretty faithfully adaptated for the screen. Still enjoyable, but not enough to put the POTter monkey on my back. Then came the Goblet of POTter and it was a big, huge, tightly-rolled fatty at 750 pages. The cut, diluted movie strain couldn\u2019t hope to be as potent as the primo original and the story was finally given the room to breathe and take on an epic feel. It was completely addictive. The world-building details started coming fast and furious and the characters were given considerably increased depth. Add that to Rowling\u2019s breezy, \u201cear friendly\u201d prose and I found myself spaced out for hours turning the pages and still hungering for more. It\u2019s high praise indeed when I say that 750 pages did not contain a single dull, ploddy moment. This was fun and wonderful and a pleasure to experience. It deserves to be recognized for the iconic work that it is in the realm of YA fantasy. Is it popcorn? Certainly. Is it a joy to read? Definitely. Is it one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to all lovers of feel good, comfort food? YES. 5.0 stars.

ROWLING FORESHADOWS EVERYTHINGGGG-when the Weasley men come to Privet Drive through the Dursleys' fireplace is just.... priceless. Yet ANOTHER scene that I wish had made it into the movie.-We get to meet Bill in this book (way earlier than in the movies, I might add), and Mrs. Weasley is very disapproving of how Bill looks. I love that Bill stood up for himself and was like NOBODY GIVE AN F HOW I LOOK, AND NEITHER DO IIIIII. It was a nice thing to throw in there.-Dobby is also in this book more, and seeing how different he is was really fun.-Harry and Ron fighting made my heart hurt so much.-All of the drama at the Yule Ball just made me SQUEEE because it's so obvious that Ron and Hermione like each other and they just don't want to admit it and GAH. THE FEELS.-I also love how much Hermione stands up for what she believes in, which you can particularly see in this book. She wants justice for the house-elves, she won't let Ron get away with being an idiot (like when he says he just wants a pretty girl to go to the ball with), and she is especially confident in this book as well. Malfoy and many other people are constantly teasing her, but she is completely above it, and for that I admire her.-WHEN HARRY IS LISTENING TO HAGRID AND MADAME MAXIME AND HE SEES THE BEETLE? IMAGINE IF HE HAD JUST STEPPED ON IT? WOULDN'T THAT HAVE BEEN GREAT?-I completely forgot about the part where Harry sees Barty Crouch on the Marauders Map! He was so close to finding out something big, but then things got crazy and he didn't, but WHOA. SO CLOSE. -Cedric's death hit me a lot harder than it ever has before... He was such an amazing person, and I wish that he could have survived so him and Harry could have been buddies.-VOLDEMORT FORESHADOWS HORCRUXES IN THIS BOOK. TWO MORE BOOKS UNTIL HARRY ACTUALLY LEARNS THOUGH.ok so I think it's safe to say that this is one of my favorites in the series for sure.

Here are some of my favourites:1. S.P.E.W.2. Hermione in every scene ever3. The house elves and the kitchen scenes (I'm honestly so in love with the kitchens. Every time they tickle the pear in the portrait I get all excited)4. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons5. The Yule Ball and the fact that Harry thinks Hermione is a girl he's never seen before6. The fact that Ron has a huge crush on Krum while Hermione stays utterly unimpressed and as soon as Krum takes her to the ball the situation changes, Hermione likes Krum and Ron rips him (well, miniature him) apart7. Harry's fight with Ron. Not because I enjoy them fighting but because Jo perfectly captures the feeling of anger and frustration that I have everytime I'm in a similiar situation.8. The Wonky Feint. I'm still laughing.9. Rita Skeeter's reports. I love to hate her.10. Severus Snape cold bloodedly claiming he can't see a difference when Hermione's teeth are half a metre longer than usual. This incredible man.11. Molly Weasley being such a good mom to Harry. Got tears in my eyes just thinking about it.12. Hermione's triumph over a vicious beetle.Still, the book is not my favourite in the series, the reason being the horrible graveyard scene in the end. It's just a little too much to take for my poor Potter heart.Find more of my books on Instagram"}, {"userName": "Adam Silvera", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4050629-adam-silvera", "userReview": "Reread done for #AdamRereadsHP! GOBLET OF FIRE is definitely work and I could've done for a lot of cutting. One of the things I admire most about this series is the way J.K. Rowling can speed through a year in under 300 pages. And GOBLET is twice that length and it didn't always feel justified. I shouldn't complain because more time in this world is MORE TIME IN THIS WORLD, and it's all very realized, but the pacing still felt off. (I really, really could've done without the Quidditch World Cup.) When I first read this novel when I was 13 going on 14, I took a break for MONTHS. And the same thing happened during this reread as a 28-year-old. I think it was around the same part too. But once you get to the Third Task, it all picks up. This last fourth of the novel has always been my favorite. Voldemort's return! That scene with the Death Eaters! Harry vs. Voldemort! Moody isn't Moody! Rita Skeeter exposed! It's all wonderful. GOBLET isn't my favorite in the series, but it's still pretty damn magical."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "I have no idea why this didn't show as being read but who cares.

Rowling. Although this one was close to a 5 for me, I think it's enough to give 1 book in the series a 5-rating, which means this one will stay at a 4. But I still loved and adored the characters, the setting, the story, the themes... all of it! Rather than go into a detailed review, as we've seen too many of them (always fun to read tho!), I'm just going to chat a little bit about the parts that I enjoyed the most.1. The selection of the 3 students to participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. It's scary to think the schools condone putting the kids at such risk, but then again, I suppose they'd stop it just before anyone died or was hurt irreparably. To imagine the goblet of fire choosing one from each school, and then Harry's name being cast as a fourth one... fantastic idea and approach. I felt the drama. And I loved having him put to the test mid-way thru the series... as he never seemed to be all that good of a student or a wizard!2. The introduction of new characters in this one is intense. I loved all the folks at the various stages of the competition. To see feelings emerge for one another, to know they were going thru the same unrequited love and anger we all go through as teenagers. Was a good experience -- I thought it was one of the more real aspects of the series.3. The imagination for all the tournaments and the dance... fantastic. I wanted to be there watching it all happen. I can only imagine how it felt to write those scenes... knowing it would propel the characters forward in a very different path by the end. And to see the drama of how it all turns out.I am feeling the need to re-read this series again soon...\n\nAbout Me\n\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads, and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https://thisismytruthnow.com, where you'll also find TV & Film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I've visited all over the world.

Who knows ? Harry Potter grows up and becomes a boy who has to take the responsibility on his shoulders, he never wants to be selected, he never wants glory and prestige, yet the world turns against him anyway.I love that this book isn't a children's book anymore, in my opinion, it becomes hastily intense and has more dimensions than J.K. Rowling had ever intended. She did a great job when she wrote this book, I could see her intention for the book to be a mature one and she made the right decision for doing that. I'm so pround of her and so she becomes my favorire author EVER !\n\u201cIf you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.\u201d \nNot only this book is full of adventures, but it hides some messages for you to discover. Isn't it the best way to teach our children via books ? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has everything I've asked for since the first time I read. Until now, the book is like a gem and I think of it as my treasure because it's so precious my eyes hurt to look at.Many things happen in this book such as a tragedy and deprecation, but it's the way our lives go on, right ? So I embraced this book like a teddy bear and told myself that perhaps something really bad would happen, but it's just mishaps and it would pass like a rainy day.\n\u201cRemember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.\u201d\n#TeamKrumioneMore at http://goo.gl/kNcx2n"}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11284813-christy", "userReview": "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was my most anticipated read of the series\u2026 It\u2019s my favorite movie (I KNOW I KNOW- the books are SO MUCH BETTER) and it\u2019s where the books really start to get intense. Even though there was a part that brought tears to my eyes, its not as sad as whats yet to come\u2026 I feel like this book is the book of transitioning for Harry, Ron and Hermione. This is the last book of their childhood. If the movies follow the books as well as I hope, shit really starts to get real after this one. There is a lot of depth to this story, the characters and it gets a bit darker than the first three. I love the Tri-Wizard Tournament aspect and the new characters we meet. Once again, I listened to the audio book and the narration was fantastic. If you\u2019ve never read the books before, or your a long time fan- I highly recommend these audio books. The narrator does a fantastic job. I love getting lost in the world of Harry Potter and can\u2019t wait to read more <3"}, {"userName": "Brina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina", "userReview": "This is at least the 10th time I have read Harry Potter. I feel like I am doing a disservice writing a review of this book. That being said, I usually reread the entire series around this time of year when I am waiting for spring to start. It is like revisiting an old friend and brings a warm feeling to my heart. In my last review, I equated reading Potter to warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top, basically the ultimate comfort read. My favorite section in this book occurs in the last 150 pages. The first time I read the series it was my favorite book because of all the action and new characters. Digging deeper, I have come to love book 3 more but value book 4 as it acts like a segue to years 5-7. Harry comes face to face with Voldemort at last and leaves behind the rest of his childhood innocence. Dark times await in the near future, and Harry must keep his friends close at hand. As the Hogwarts Express leaves Hogsmeade station, we grow apprehensive of the journey that Harry has just embarked upon and look forward with excitedly to the next installment of J. K. Rowling's magical world."}, {"userName": "Andie ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30510075-andie", "userReview": "I've read this series more times than I can even remember. But every time it feels like the first time all over again. There's always certain details that I forget between my re-reads and movie watching and it's great to revisit and remember why this is one of my favorites of the series. I loved how much foreshadowing is in it and knowing what's coming, certain parts just break my heart. I decided to do the audio book by Jim Dale for the first time ever. Oh my was it great! Definitely recommend it!
