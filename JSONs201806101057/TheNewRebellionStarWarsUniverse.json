In fact, this book seems more like a Star Wars movie than some of the films themselves. I've read nearly all of the Star Wars expanded universe novels including the film adaptations and can personally vouch for this title. The New Rebellion is superb! Although I won't say it is the best Star Wars novel there is (it isn't), it is the ONLY novel that reads like it is part of the film saga. The character are so much like themselves in this book that I can't believe that George Lucas didn't write the dialogue! One of the big complaints that I have with the other Star Wars novels, is that they don't feel like the films. One of the reasons for this is that the other novels lack the trademark Star Wars humor. Fortunately, this book has all of the essential action and humor which defines Star Wars!The only problem that I have with The New Rebellion is its main villain. (Note: this book was written before the release of Episodes 1-3.) With that said, I really hate most of the villains of the expanded Star Wars universe. After having been introduced to Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace, it will take more than the generic wanna be Sith Lord to peek my interest. Why do Star Wars expanded universe authors think they always have to come up with 2nd class villains who they believe are even nearly as cool or powerful as Darth Vader?Even so, I highly recommend The New Rebellion to Star Wars Fans. This book would get perfect marks if it dealt with more intriguing matter such as Sith Lords battling Jedis. It still rocks though!"}, {"userName": "Crystal Starr Light", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light", "userReview": "Luke and Leia feel a disturbance just moments before the great Senate Hall explodes. Luke senses that Brakiss, one of his former students turned Dark has something to do with it, and he leaves to seek him out. Han, who had been meeting with a smuggler with apparent knowledge of the explosion, leaves for Smuggler's Run to learn more about this plot, leaving Leia at home to protect Han from negative implications and to balance the power held precariously by the former Imperial senators who now populate the senate.NOTE: This is a review based on the audio book and what I remember from reading the actual novel years ago.I Liked:I was afraid going into this book. Terrified at the outcome, terrified to read yet another subpar Star Wars novel. But I was pleasantly surprised at what Rusch gives us. The New Rebellion is a rather enjoyable novel.Rusch firstly pulls us into the novel really quickly. She introduces her new character, Kueller, and ties in Brakiss from the Young Jedi Knights series. Not a chapter later, the Senate explodes. This was a good move, the audience didn't really need a huge build up like we did in the Black Fleet Crisis or the Thrawn Trilogy.The story isn't hugely complicated, yet is different and unique. For fear of giving spoilers, I won't reveal the source of the explosions, but it is not a superweapon and has a very believable grounding. The story then follows the three (four, if you include the bad guys) subplots: Leia, Han, and Luke. These are well done, exceedingly, and all tie into the main plot perfectly. Leia stays on Coruscant for a while until she and Wedge leave for Almania. Han decides, after speaking with a smuggler who promptly dies, to head to Smuggler's Run. Lando then goes after Han, at Leia's request. Lastly, Luke leaves to seek out Brakiss. Through his interactions with Cole Fardreamer, we set off another thread, where Cole leaves with R2-D2 and C-3PO. Unlike with other books (namely, the Black Fleet Crisis), all the plots tie in with each other and don't go branching off in other, strange, disconnected ways. Not to mention, each plot thread makes sense for each character on it. Leia isn't going to Smuggler's Run and Han isn't after Brakiss or some other strange combination.I was impressed with how Rusch handled the characters. Han was a perfectly balance of smuggler and general. I liked how Leia was biased against the former Imperials who were joining the Senate (and how Rusch didn't fall back on having them be portrayed as bad guys--in many ways, Leia is the \"bad guy\" for being so biased). And I want to applaud Rusch's Luke. While I do have reservations (see below), Luke is much, much, much better written than in almost every other book. He was powerful, he was smart, he was a Jedi. I could believe that this was the Luke in the movies. Cole Fardreamer was an interesting character, if too Luke Skywalker for my liking. I did enjoy seeing Rusch include Mara Jade and Talon Karrde, two characters who are continually overlooked in EU. I thought they were adequately done.I Didn't Like:How is it that so many people are from Tatooine or there are Tatooine references? This book has two of them: Cole Fardreamer is from Tatooine (hence the last name) and the smugglers import Jawas from Tatooine to clean equipment. I am really beginning to doubt Luke's whiny \"If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.\"While Rusch does a much better job than many other authors, she still falls back on crippling Luke to make him, I guess, more manageable. Here, Luke falls and breaks his ankle. Of course, he can't get away to fix it up. Oh, no, he has to walk all over the place, climb ladders, battle with a broken ankle. Good grief.One of my few complaints about the audiobook was how the narrator gave Wedge Antilles an inexplicable Scottish accent. I didn't even know who he was personifying until I finally caught a \"Wedge\" and did a double take. What is even stranger is that I never recall the narrator in the Jedi Academy Trilogy audiobooks Wedge having a Scottish accent and Wedge certainly didn't have a Scottish accent in the movie.Rusch doesn't do a particularly impressive job with the ysalamiri. She almost makes the animal generate a motion sickness field. Mara gets headaches in the field, Kueller suddenly acts stupid, Luke and Leia get sick...you catch my drift. My impression of the ysalamiri is that they push back the Force. You could sense the darkness in the Force, and, once inside, you couldn't sense the Force and were as if blinded. None of the symptoms have ever included \"nausea, vomiting, migraines, and stupidity\".I thought the plot was really creative, but the payoff at the end is very weak and lacking. I couldn't help but be disappointed at the outcome.The battle sequences were not particularly brilliant. Wedge takes a leap of faith and starts blasting at his allies to learn that the crew of the Star Destroyers are the stupidest droids that money can buy. I can't believe Kueller would have purchased droids without the ability to think strategically and tactically for the sole purpose of crewing his fleet. He should have sprung for the upgrade. Luke and Leia fight against Kueller, and while them working together is awesome, the actual battle is pretty lame. It goes something like this:\"Kueller smashed his lightsaber at Luke. Luke blocked, then blocked, then parried. Leia shot at Kueller and Kueller ducked.\"*yawn*But by far the worst part I found was the antagonists/villains. Brakiss and Kueller are just not up to the task. Not only am I amazed that both were former Jedi students (Luke has a bad success rate, huh?), but I was astounded that, yet again, Kueller wants Luke and Leia as his minions just for the heck of it. Oh-kay. That makes zero sense. Kueller was upset at Leia because his parents die, but now he wants to turn Luke and Leia to the Dark Side? I just don't get that line of logic. I think also Rusch attempted to make him minutely sympathetic, but it failed. Kueller is too pathetic, too evil, too maniacal laugh for me to feel sorry about his family. Also, kinda hard to overlook the mass murder to enact revenge (we *are* looking at you, Kyp Durron).Brakiss is no better. I felt he was more whiny brat than an actual force. He was easily manipulated by Kueller, when that felt odd. Don't you remember what this guy looked like under the mask? Pillsbury Dough Boy? So why are you always cowering in fear? And having him get kidnapped as a baby by the Imperials--wow, it's almost as if the Imperials are bad now.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Minimal (I don't recall any).Han and Leia have some time alone towards the end.There is a senate explosion, Luke fights pink bubbles, Kueller threatens to set off more explosions.Overall:One of the better books of this era, The New Rebellion has a lot going for it. Good story that doesn't rely on superweapons, good character interpretations, interesting developments. Not too fond of the bad guys, who are instantly forgettable, but this is one book that won't have you clutching your head in agony when you finish reading it."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/216373-jessica", "userReview": "Definitely one of my favorite Star Wars pieces.

Like the original trilogy, it is fun, exciting, fast-paced, and reminiscent of the classic pulp sci-fi stories from which George Lucas was inspired.It is also one of the few SWEU novels that blatantly attempts to interject relevant social commentary within its fantasy setting, using the Star Wars universe as a way to examine current events. In this novel, Rusch cleverly examines the terrorist mindset: how and why terrorists do what they do. Interestingly enough, Rusch published this novel in 1996, five years before 9/11 (but three years after the 1993 bombing of the North Tower of the World Trade Center, which resulted in six deaths and hundreds of injuries). \u201cAl-Qaeda\u201d, \u201cTaliban\u201d, and \u201cOsama bin Laden\u201d were not the common household terms that they are today. Americans went about their lives back then with a sense of safety and ignorance, as if the entire U.S. was encapsulated under a protective bubble from the dangers of the rest of the world.Reading \u201cThe New Rebellion\u201d today, with the jaded eyes of the post-9/11 world, tarnishes some of the \u201cfun\u201d of the novel, but Rusch is certainly not at fault. She could not have foreseen the horrors of that calm September Tuesday. That parts of her novel eerily parallel the events of that awful day may feel unsettling, it is purely coincidental.The plot: President Leia Organa of the New Republic is just about to begin her speech to open Senate when an explosion interrupts the session. Dozens of senators are instantly killed, and hundreds are wounded, including Leia, in what appears to be a terrorist attack.Just prior to the attack, Luke, Leia, and the Solo children felt a great disturbance in the Force, similar to the kind that Obi Wan Kenobi felt when Alderaan was destroyed many years before. Somewhere in the universe, millions of lives have been snuffed out in an instant.The perpetrator of this heinous crime is a mysterious figure named Kueller, who sits on a self-appointed throne on the distant planet Almania. The Force is extremely strong within Kueller, but it is the Dark Side of the Force. He has waited a long time to exact revenge upon the children of Anakin Skywalker, and he has calculated an elaborate plot to destroy the New Republic, the Jedi Knights, and the entire Skywalker family.To give more away would be spoilers. If you\u2019re a Star Wars fan who hasn\u2019t read this one yet, I highly recommend doing so now."}, {"userName": "Sophi Link", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42379547-sophi-link", "userReview": "For some reason, I've always been loath to pick up books based on movies, tv shows, video games, or what have you. Maybe it's because the authors are so rarely (are they ever?) the same people who created the fictional world and characters, or because the movie/tv show/video game/what have you feels complete in itself, or maybe I'm just a book snob. Who knows.Whatever the reasons behind my ingrained biases, this weekend I had a horizon-broadening experience as I read this lovely Star Wars novel, the first of many bequeathed to me by my lovely, book-donating boyfriend. Okay, maybe \"lovely\" isn't the word for this book. Exciting, action-packed, rewarding: all of these work better. Mostly, though, I was impressed by two things. One, the author's fairly deft handling of multiple storylines. She didn't always pull it off without a hitch, but I'll take the slight bumps to my suspension of disbelief for the emotional gratification of getting to see all the working parts move together. And two, this book has a genuine Star Wars feel. There was humor and excitement and suspense and some moral ambiguity (!) and overall just a real edge-of-your-seat good time that I didn't know could be replicated in book form. At least for Star Wars. Also, props to the author for keeping Han and Leia apart for most of the story. There should be a law against allowing couples whose romantic arc is based on sexual tension and witty back-and-forth to be shown past the point where they kiss and get together at the end. It just feels so wrong."}, {"userName": "Matthew Vinueza", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24780534-matthew-vinueza", "userReview": "Star Wars The New Rebellion Somewhere in the galaxy, millions of people are suddenly eradicated in seconds that then triggers a moment of sadness horror and pain.

I thought that this was a pretty decent book, there were many parts where I was at the edge of my seat and didn't exactly know was going to happen next. it was a bit suspenseful which made me eager to continue reading this book .

I'm please to say that The New Rebellion fell into the former category for me. This one grabbed me right from the start, with the mysterious genocide event perpetuated by a new villain by unknown means, followed very quickly by a bombing at the Senate Hall in what appeared to be an assassination attempt against Princess Leia. The book started on a strong note and maintained my interest throughout.While I sometimes feel like these books arbitrarily give subplots to characters just to keep them involved in the action, everybody had interesting roles in this one, from R2-D2 and C-3PO revealing a particularly dangerous situation, to Han Solo and Lando Calrissian getting involved with a smuggler station in a subplot that at first appeared completely unrelated to the main storyline, but ended up tying in nicely. (I also enjoyed how the author addressed Lando Calrissian's lingering guilt over having betrayed Solo so many years ago during the events of The Empire Strikes Back, something I don't recall other Star Wars authors having done.)I also particularly enjoyed Leia in this one. While I feel like her character is often limited to being kidnapped by the given book's antagonist, or being constantly maligned by the politicians in the New Republic (which, to be fair, did happen again in this one), I liked that Leia was very strongly involved in fighting Kueller, the Big Bad of this book, rather than taking a back seat and letting Luke do all the work. (The revelation of how Kueller was committing his mass genocides was an interesting and creative twist as well.)It's a shame Kristine Kathryn Rusch only wrote one Star Wars book, but I certainly enjoyed her entry into this wonderful universe."}, {"userName": "Arlene Kellas", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14330057-arlene-kellas", "userReview": "This is the book all Star Wars fans want.

I felt like they behaved and spoke the way that they should (particularly Luke, which is often one I am most critical of as people tend to have a hard time getting him right). So, for that, a definite thumbs up. On the negative side. The mystery was easily solved very, very early in the book, and I found it distressing that an advanced civilization couldn't investigate the correct cause of a tragedy, when I could figure it out from my couch. This also meant that the story felt dragged out much further than it needed to be. If I were to summarize the story it wouldn't take that much time, which is strange since the book clocks in at over 500 pages. I think that some of the newer characters could have been better drawn (Cole Fardreamer for one). I also felt that some of the story opportunities were lost. Didn't the main baddy want to let one of our heroes know why he was so upset? I thought so, but that never actually happened when it came down to it. Maybe he's a baddy who learned to shoot first and give exposition later... I'm not sure.

Rusch brings in a lot of information seen in previously released forms of media - much more than with BFC. The Solo children are in this more often, particularly with their Force abilities and how Leia and Han manage their work lives with parental ones. However, Rusch introduces quite a few new species and characters; the info-dump confused me a bit.She also doesn't use anything from the BFC, showing some of the lack of continuity that was in Lucasbooks at that time.I had an overwhelming sense of Christian themes while reading this, particularly in chapter 6:\"When something destroys life on a grand scale, we feel it as if it happened to us. Because, in a sense, it did.\" (Luke)Then two paragraphs later, he tells the Solo kids that sending heat to a cold place is like sending love to those who have only known hate. We can help others heal with that love and heat, even though we can't take the event from them, make lives reappear.There are a few things I don't like with her writing style. While I appreciate the simple sentences and short chapters, some of the sentences (and then paragraphs) are choppy, and try to force too many cliff-hanger-type endings to chapters. Brakiss is used yet again by another Dark Sider - this one named Kueller, who helped him after the events on Yavin 4, in \"I, Jedi.\" Even in this book, I feel bad for him, despite knowing where he ends up. (As a side note, in looking up his info on Wookieepedia, I was surprised to see that Brakiss first appeared in the YJK series, even though \"I, Jedi\" chronologically came before that series and this novel. That shows even more how much Rusch tied together with regards to the EU at the time).Kueller destroys millions of people, a horror felt by multiple Force sensitives, including Leia and her children. Luke is a fantastic uncle and mentor as he talks to the kids about what they felt. I definitely get the sense that Rusch has had experience with talking to children so that they didn't feel patronized nor falsely placated while having their concerns addressed.Anakin is quit precocious and has an overactive streak. Rusch's portrayal of children is spot-on.Han's old smuggling buddy Jarril comes to him for help in the Smuggler's Run. From the start, the reader wants to believe all of the big three:Luke - The deaths of millions and the destruction at the Senate are not isolated, independent events.Leia - Some of the former Imperials can't be trusted; they blew up the Senate.Han - Okay, but we can't blame everything on former Imperials, and it's likely that the Senate bomb and issues in the Smuggler's Run have some connection.Really, I'm surprised at how vehemently against the former Imps Leia is, and the discrimination she has against them. I'm touched though by Han: despite his issues with 3PO, he doesn't want to see the droid destroyed.Something that I liked more with the BFC was that Leia expected to be investigated; otherwise, a team isn't doing their job correctly. Here, she was shocked at the thought that she would be investigated.Kueler is crazy but he has a solid understanding of history and the Force.Rusch uses the word \"flimsy\" instead of paper. That is perfect!Cole Fardreamer makes me smile. I'm so glad he found out his mechanical abilities WERE important, despite pushback, and that he could leave Tatooine and help the New Republic in his own way. R2 helps him uncover interestingly scary information about a new X-Wing computer system.I love 3PO tagging along and helping R2.There is an interesting animosity towards droids by the Kloperians.Weird Things- Gobbledy gook- Celsius (though I understand why this was used).- Winter calling Han \"sir.\"- Leia being so damned adamant that former Imperials can't be trusted to work with the New Republic."}, {"userName": "Michael Otway", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14305210-michael-otway", "userReview": "3.5 Stars. Not Quite The Thrawn Trilogy quality, but better than all the rest. After reading through the pretty average New Republic Era of Stackpoles atrocious X-Wing books, to the slack Jedi Academy Trilogy, it was like a breath of fresh air reading this book. Other than Zahn's work, this is the best of the new Republic era books. I would go as far as to say in this era you should really only read this and Zahn's books. However it is not without it's flaws.WHAT I LIKED:- It was a solid story all the way through.- It was a really big, really ambitious story. With books like this, most of the other authors have gone either far too small or tried hard to make it seem big, but not being talented enough to actually do it. This author makes the stakes feel huge, and the scale, massive. It was really nice to read a book where you felt like things really could go wrong.- The characters read well, like the film characters.- The mystery unravelled piece by piece and was well crafted.- It had Mara Jade in it.- She got Wedge and Lando right! (Honestly, my biggest frustration of the writers in this era is the need to bring in Wedge and Lando into every damned story, when they have no reason to be there, just to have them kind of hang around, but they were both useful and well done in this book.- I liked the bad guy character. He felt realyl powerful and threatening for so much of the book. He unravels a bit in the end, but overall, he felt like a strong bad guy.- I liked Leia's bias against the Imperials. It served the story well.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:- The pink bubble monster. Wtf! Honestly, the book was going so well and then this came along to take away all credibility. Reminded me of the blob-race chapter in Jedi Search.- Luke was weak. Oh man, far too many of these books make him weak and pathetic. The whole story he's injured or broken or paralysed and iot gets ridiculous.- She CANNOT write action. Lightsaber fights literally read as \"Strike. Parry. Strike. Parry\" and \"Duck. Parry. Duck. Parry\" It's pretty awful compared to how some of the other authors are able to craft these scenes.- Too much politics. It was fun at first, but the sheer amount in this book made it feel like the prequels.- The ysalmari work very differently in this book than they did in the Thrawn Trilogy, making them have a completely different effect on force users, which was pretty silly.- While I liked the bad guy throughout the book, in the end, he was far too weak and unravelled pretty fast. His accomplice was pretty pathetic too.- The entire droid factory scene with R2 and C3PO was utterly absurd and pushed the boundaries of believability.- Everything was all too convenient in the end. Every single one of the 10 threads came together so conveniently that again, it pushes the boundaries of credibility when you imagine that if even one of them had gone differently, it would have been complete disaster. In the end, the huge 500 page build-up falls flat and is just \"all too easy\".- At 540 pages, it really slumps in the middle, between about pages 100-300. Then it gets good again from 300 or so to the end.But all together, despite these annoyances, it's a very solid and entertaining read and I enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Anime Mage", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68491769-anime-mage", "userReview": "You know what? The Expanded Universe is the gift that keeps on giving. While undeniably there are plenty of books with in the EU that just aren't very good, there are also a handful of books that are fairly enjoyable and even a few that surpass the movies. Thankfully, this book is one of the better entries in this ongoing franchise. In fact, I would go as far as to say that this is one of my favorite Star Wars novels.Basically, Luke Skywalker and Crew have to stop one of his fallen students (who now leads the remnants of the Empire) from causing trouble for the New Republic.The first thing I like about this book was the portrayal of the characters. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, and all the other characters from The Original Trilogy are true to form. Plus, the new characters introduced feel so natural to the StarWars universe that they feel like they have always been there.The second thing I like about the book was the writing. The thoughts of the characters are made with both clarity and potency while being immersive and highly detailed without being convoluted. Action scenes feel intense, fluid, and highly engaging. Honestly, the writing seen here is really well done. The third thing I like antagonist....he was just awesome. For one thing, he was credible threat to our heroes. For example, Luke couldn't simply steam roll through him in a few pages. In fact, Luke had a hard time defeating his fallen apprentice....and even then Luke actually lost the first time. For another thing...he actually had real motivations. I am not going to spoil what those motivations are....but I felt moved by them none the less.And the final aspects of the book that I liked were the overall narrative and pacing. The story remained highly engaging and enjoyable for most of the proceeding, and there were enough plot developments and well-executed action scenes that made the book reasonably paced.The only negative thing I have to say about this book was that one of the characters, specially the antagonist's apprentice, didn't get closure on his storyline. I just wish that his story arc was resolved here instead of some other StarWars novel. But this flaw is so minor that I don't think that it significantly impacted my enjoyment of this book.Final verdict:Overall, I love this book. The characters were great, the writing was highly effective, the antagonist was perfect, and the pacing/narrative were highly engaging. Thus, I give this book a perfect 5/5 stars - A must read for any and all Star Wars Fans!!"}, {"userName": "Pieter", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24493459-pieter", "userReview": "- This review contains spoilers! May the Force be with you.- At the end of episode VI, I would have expected that creating a new republic would be a piece of cake. The first 20 pages of this novel prove me wrong \u2026- This is the first Star Wars book I read that takes place after \u2018Return of the Jedi\u2019.- There are several books between \u2018Return of the Jedi\u2019 and this book, so those might have given me a better insight on the situation the New Republic is in. - - However, these books are not canon, as far as I know. These book were listed at the end of the book, hence, the list probably not up to date.- Han Solo is clearly struggling with his past (as a smuggler). For me it was already a surprise that Han settled on Corusant, and tries to be a real father for his children, yes, Han Solo and kids. Who would have thought.- Leila is the sister of Luke, however, I\u2019ve never thought of her being a Jedi. Yes, that\u2019s my mistake.- As a result of this, Leila started the Jedi training, however, she hasn\u2019t finished it yet. What do you expect if your husband is Han Solo, you have three children, and you are the leader of the New Republic?- Next to having a connection with the Force, she also caries a lightsaber with her. This is, to me, a strange combination, especially because during the original trilogy we only saw her with a blaster in her hand.- The overall development of the story was good, but some people might find the beginning a little bit slow-paced. However, this was not the case for me.- The different story lines of the (groups of) characters really didn\u2019t seem connected in the beginning/middle, but in/near the end they all came together. This really gave me an \u2018Aaahh\u2019 feeling.- I had a weird feeling during the first part of the book, a certain tension created by the mood of the story (maybe related to the previous bullet), however, near the end it faded and it was replaced by a heroic Star Wars feeling which lasted till the last page of the book.- It almost felt like a real Star Wars movie.- One of the main characters is killed by a blaster, really?

Leia, as the Chief of State, does not like this and does not trust the former Imperials, but knows that democracy must be allowed to run its course. Then, an explosion rocks the Senate chamber on Coruscant, and when the dust settles and the wounded and injured are counted, accusations begin to fly. Leia must deal with the political fallout, which grows even worse when it turns out that Han Solo might be connected to whatever happened.Meanwhile, Luke feels a great disturbance in the Force, as if many people have died at once (think Alderaan all over again). He pursues leads that take him to one of his former Jedi students, only to discover that the student is only the bait in a much larger trap.And Lando and Han Solo follow leads that might give them insight into how the terrorist attack was carried out, but that require them to enter back into the seamy criminal underworld which they once knew so well - and to confront enemies from their own pasts.This is one of the better EU books I have read so far, and there are really two reasons for that. First, the plot is actually somewhat original. Although all of the elements have been used before, the configuration is unique. The enemy behind everything is not another Imperial warlord, but rather a genuinely new threat. And his plan of attack is one that we have not previously seen. Second, and more importantly, Rusch gets the characters right. Oh, how she gets them right! Everyone is allowed to do what they do best. Lando and Han and Chewie get to be rogues and scoundrels (with hearts of gold). Luke gets to be a true Jedi Knight, facing off with another Force adept in a showdown at the end. Leia gets to be both the diplomat and the feisty Princess with a blaster. Even Threepio and Artoo are given unique moments of droid heroism. The dialogue from each of the characters feels like it could have been ripped straight from one of the film scripts.All in all, this is the EU book that has felt the most like the original film trilogy for me since I read the Zahn books. Recommended, even for the more casual Star Wars fan."}, {"userName": "Sebastien", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7104916-sebastien", "userReview": "Avec ma commande de Shadow of the Empire j'ai commander 2 autre livres: New Rebellion et Corellian Trilogy.Je dois dire qu'apr\u00e8s avoir lu Shadow of the Empire, la commande \u00e9tait s\u00e9v\u00e8re que d'avoir un roman aussi satisfaisant. De par ma critique vous croierez que ce ne fut pas le cas, mais je dois dire que j'ai lu ce roman en 2 semaine et que ce fut une de mes lecture les plus rapide \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque.Pourquoi ai-je donc cot\u00e9 ce livre 3* seulement, c'est parce que ce qui m'a pousser \u00e0 en lire plus c'est la sur-utilisation de l'auteur de la fin de chapitre de type Cliffhanger et le nombre de d\u00e9ception que cette utilisation a occasionn\u00e9.Je m'explique. Il y a facilement 2 chapitre sur 5 qui finisse dans le style \"il va changer d'avis sinon il va mourir\", \"la personne s'en va voir son supp\u00e9rieur et il va l'\u00e9couter sinon il mourra croyant \u00e0 ses convictions\" \"tel personnage s'en va voir son allier et il va le payer de sa vie\". Vous voyez le style, sa laisse sous-entendre que \"\u00e7a va chier\", que quelqu'un va laver le plancher avec sa face ou que certain personnage vont souffrir/mourir. Mais l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement en question avait toujours lieu 1 \u00e0 2 chapitres plus tard. Donc \u00e7a me poussait \u00e0 lire plus afin de savoir comment \u00e7a allait se r\u00e9gl\u00e9 et \"pouff\" quand le chapitre commen\u00e7ais le personnage \u00e9tait polie/peureux/lavette et il ne se passait rien de ce que j'avais pu esp\u00e9r\u00e9.Il me semble que quand un perso dit \"I'm gonna change his way of thinking or die trying!\" tu t'attend \u00e0 un peu d'action. Mais dans ce livre il y avait toujours un \u00e9chappatoire. Sa finissait toujours par un p\u00e9tard mouill\u00e9. C'est sur que les id\u00e9es de base du roman \u00e9taient int\u00e9ressante et certain bout son carr\u00e9ment m\u00e9morable. Mais la sur-utilisation du cliffhanger m'a beaucoup g\u00e2cher mon plaisir de lecture car je me suis senti \"cheater\".Un bon livre \u00e0 lire tout de m\u00eame et s'il existait un suite je l'aurais surement lu depuis longtemps."}, {"userName": "JJ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8910475-jj", "userReview": "Star Wars: The New Rebellion is the first Kristine Kathryn Rusch novel I've ever read. The \"About the Author\" page in the back of the book indicates that, at the time the novel was published in 1996, Rusch had received nominations for and won a handful of prestigious awards. Regretfully, then, I must admit that I didn't care for this book very much. There were many fine ideas in the book, but many of the plot threads felt padded, too drawn out. The resolution of the story was anti-climactic after the big build of a mysterious new weapon and a vastly powerful and mysterious foe. The characterizations were flat. And, for me, the biggest downfall was the writing style. It was not bad, but it was not great either. It was just OK. A lot of sentences were clunky, mechanically constructed, and never achieved a sweep and flow that fully engaged me in the tale. As I progressed deeper and deeper into the book, I'll admit, I was anxious to reach the end. Not to learn the resolution of the story, but just to be done with it. This is not a horrible book, there are some fascinating creatures in it, R2-D2 plays a big part and does something very cool, and there are some fun scenes. It's the sort of book and story to which I would normally give a 3-star rating. Perhaps, if the writing had been a bit more elegant, and if the plotting and pace had been a bit tighter, I would have."}, {"userName": "Darryl Dobbs", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43479831-darryl-dobbs", "userReview": "The Star Wars books had been waning of late (reading them chronologically), but they got a 'little' better with this one. A former Jedi-in-training (looks like they don't use the term 'Padawan' in the new, rebuilt Jedi Order) has turned to the dark side and tries to destroy both Luke and Leia. He also manages to cobble together a pretty big army and, with his followers under the guise of the Empire, infiltrates the New Republic. The plotlines involve Luke going after his former student, Han trying to investigate who is behind some bombings by going to his old smuggler colleagues, Lando going after Han to warn him, the droids stumbling on a larger plot and trying to get someone's (anyone's) attention, and Leia trying to hold the Senate together. The Senate is in trouble as some former Imperials have managed to worm their way in and presumably try to take down the New Republic via legal channels.The story moved along without any serious lagging, the plot was decent if you overlook how such a young villain managed to get such assets together in such a small window, or how this giant pussycat creature could communicate via telepathy and Luke discovered this but his nemesis - who imprisoned him with said creature - did not.

This wonderful page turner by Kristine Kathryn Rusch brought out every element in the Star Wars expanded universe by executing a flawless narrative that wound around an intense plotline.By reading the narrative, it was clear that the author had done her homework. Every character down to the evil Kueller and fallen Brakiss were very round and dynamic. Also, many of the expanded universe books fail to illustrate good Star Wars heroes, but in the New Rebellion even the major familiar heroes held the qualities that were given to them in the films.The pace was as quick as the film. While reading the novel, I could almost hear John Williams' soundtrack in the background during several scenes. I would have to honestly say that The New Rebellion almost matches the intensity and depth of the Thrawn Trilogy. Read the book and remember the feeling of being part of the Star Wars universe once again. If you already read the novel, read it again. It is wonderful.

It was mind candy, but not such total fluff that it didn't require any of my attention. It was definitely plot--and not character--driven. I don't think any of the characters developed in any way, but the plot kept me interested. It wasn't a book where I knew exactly what would happen after reading the first page. In fact, I wasn't sure what exactly would happen until I was at least 3/4 of the way through the book.

I'm not sure what exactly is is about this book that pleases me so intensely, but here's a few ideas: It has some of the best Han and Leia scenes ever written, it has a fantastic scene involving Luke, Jacen, Jaina and Anakin, it's a great showcase into how the relationship has developed between Luke and Leia and how much each will risk for the other, and it's got a genuinely exciting plot and a really scary bad guy. Rusch's descriptions are magnificent; everything from the incident at the Senate hall to Luke's encounter with the Thernbee to the children's reaction to the massacres is done brilliantly. This is also one of the few standalone Star Wars books. I'm glad they didn't stretch it into a trilogy; it works wonderfully as a one-shot deal and wraps up nicely at the end.

He proceeds to go about this by killing lots and lots of people quickly and efficiently (No, it makes sense, I promise). I enjoyed this one, if for no other reason it had a bad guy who wasn't the Empire. It also explores a little the idea that even though the New Republic started with the noblest of intentions, it\u2019s not immune to corruption, incompetence, and failure. I only wished this story had stretched out a little longer. Kueller is a solid villain, so it\u2019s a bit of a letdown when everything wraps up so quickly and neatly.
