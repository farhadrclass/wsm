Perhaps this was intended as the story was written from the point of view of an 11 year old boy but I have read other books with a young storyteller that didn't seem so jerky and/or unexplainable. At times, you feel like a waterbug, skittering over the best part of the story that, in places, seems deeply submerged. Perhaps I wanted more background on why this area seemed to be such a backwater when it came to race relations. Perhaps I needed a better sense of the years when the story happened or even how the major characters ended up linked to each other before the book was almost over. Given that this was a story of realisation, perhaps the author intended to make the nuts and bolts hazy and to make you wonder where this was all going.I liked the actual \"story\" I was being told once I could see clearly (and this happened long before the storyteller realised the events) and it was obvious that the setting could have been anywhere as the race relations card was of no real importance whatsoever, it just contributed to the \"filler\".This is a first novel which may explain some of the rough edges but I note he has written nothing else since this was published in 2006."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5913149-sandy", "userReview": "Nice read. I liked the way Charles added lots of dimension to this book. We had the main story in the book which dealt with Charlie and his parents situation and then we had another deep issue of Lacy and the racial situation for Charlie and then we had Hollis which played a sinister role for Charlie. Charlie perfect little word was totally turned upside down for an eleven-year old for which he does not remember parts of which adds the drama- great story line. There were parts in the story that I was crying for Charlie, parts that had me cheering for him and later I was thinking \"what in the world are you doing Charlie!\" He sure did a lot of growing up and learned a lot about the world and himself and what he was capable (or anyone) is capable of doing. Not so sure about what they did to help Charlie was the best approach but they probably did the best they thought they could under their situation.

There's a killing and a trail, but the narrator is 11 years old so you don't see the whole picture which really helps add to the suspense. This isn't a kids book even with the young protagonist.

He\u2019d come down from Angel\u2019s Rest a couple times a week and folks cleared the sidewalks when he past.\u201d And it was soon made clear Hollis wasn't the only person in the little Virginia mountain town of questionable character with deathly secrets. Charlie\u2019s father had been murdered, his mother spiraling in depression, and it\u2019s 1967, so color and good-old-boy \u2018economics\u2019 divides the town. Then ever so subtly as the mystery unfolds and the suspense heightens, the match flame turns into a raging fire of fear, hate, and injustice. Only truth seekers and those willing to forgive can find hope and peace in the ashes and learn to start anew \u2013 which is a tall order for an adolescent boy. \u201cAngel\u2019s Rest,\u201d despite the heaviness of topic(s), it's a heartfelt enjoyable novel. Being narrated by Charlie, prose and dialogue are atmospheric authentic to that of an eleven-year-old boy, and the delivery follows suit in simplicity. The epilogue was a bit too explicitly tidy per my tastes, but some people like their loose ends tied up with a perfunctory bow. All in all, a wonderful story.

This story, which starts in Virginia's Allegheny Mountains is no exception. Charlie York is an 11 year old boy who loves the outdoors. He and his friends form a small scout troop and spend lots of time exploring Angel's Peak, which rises above their small town. The one barrier is the scary Korean War veteran, Hollis Thrasher, who lives on Angel's Peak. He is reclusive and despite their trying to steer clear of him, the boys encounter him more than once. One day, his mother is arrested for killing his father and Charlie is left in the care of Lacy Albert Coe, who is an old black man who not only cares for him but tells Charlie stories that he hopes will help the boy figure out who to be and how to live his life--to sing his own song. As the story continues, we learn just exactly what happened in the town's past that bound all of these characters together. This is a beautifully written book and thank you to the Shelfari member who recommended it!"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/546484-anne", "userReview": "This debut novel contains themes of loss, grief, racial prejudice and powerful love. Set in the late 60s in Virginia, USA - the story revolves around 11 year old Charlie York. His life has fallen apart after the death of his father. His father was shot dead in the family home. Charlie was present at the time but cannot remember the details - his mother is arrested for the murder.This is a convincing picture of Charlie's love for both of his parents and how he struggles to make sense of what is happening to his family. When Charlie's mother is arrested and held in the local jail, he is cared for by Lacy - a black man who was a friend of Charlie's father, yet has been the victim of racial hate in the town.The author is very convincing in showing the rollercoaster of emotions that Charlie has to deal with. Charlie loves both of his parents and his grandparents - yet his grandfather is a racist and a bigot and this confuses the young Charlie.A really good story with strong and likeable characters."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49732-alex", "userReview": "This book is an easy read in every sense of the word. The prose is simple, the accents are easy (when they aren't flat-out wrong), and I'd figured out the entire plot by the third paragraph (no surprises at all). Despite all these short-comings I almost gave this book five stars and recommended it anyway. Despite knowing where I was going- for the most part I enjoyed the ride. What dragged me back down to three stars (which is 'on the fence' in my rating system) - was the very annoying repetition of description throughout the book. Simple is fine, but the author crossed a line and began to treat the reader like a simpleton in places. I guess the editors know their readers though, and even with the glaring flaws this strikes me as a happy surprise pick-up in a truckstop swap or backpackers' book exchange box... or even an impulse buy at Walmart. This reads like a poor man's John Irving - and that isn't meant as an insult."}, {"userName": "Sally Whitehead", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5874718-sally-whitehead", "userReview": "What a wonderful book. For sure, it's not the most brilliantly written book ever, and elements of the plot are somewhat predictable, but it is still wholeheartedly enjoyable and incredibly readable. Comparisons to \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" are rather over generous, but many of the themes are similar.The characterisation of the wise old black man, Lacy, is simply yet beautifully crafted and his relationship with our narrator, the troubled and lonely eleven year old Charlie, is really quite moving.There is a slight jolt for the reader around the 200 page mark when the setting and focal characters rather abruptly take a different direction and as a result the pace, style and \"feel\" of the novel alter. However, in conclusion this actually adds to the reader's empathy with young Charlie as he too begins to adjust and \"start over\".Fantastic small town American setting with lovely characters, a simple yet engaging plot and timeless themes.

Great writing. Good at getting into kids' heads. The main character, a little boy, was probably a little too astute for his age, but this was a heart-wrenching and, I think, fairly realistic portrayal of a damaged family because of a marriage for poor reasons and lack of fidelity.
