I\u2019d found out what Lady Audley\u2019s secret was. I didn\u2019t really want to read any further. But, that\u2019s what I was meant to think. Her actual secret isn\u2019t revealed to the very end. And, I must say, I was rather surprised. I didn't see it coming. It was quite a shocking discovery. I\u2019d spent the rest of the novel is a state of absolute certainty regarding the secret. I thought it was quite a crap secret to be honest. Well, not entirely crap, but revealed too early within the narrative. It disrupted the narrative drive, I felt like I had nothing new to discover. But, again, that\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t the real secret. It was a red herring meant to throw the reader off. The result of this was a pleasant surprise towards the end, though it also meant that the first third of the novel were incredibly slow, whereas the last parts were intense and utterly gripping. Overall, it was a fairly enjoyable book, but I could not get over my lack of engagement with it in the beginning. Its purposeful obviousness made me want to stop reading, but it did make up for it in the end. \n\n \"My intellect is a little way upon the wrong side of that narrow boundary-line between sanity and insanity.\"\n\nThis is a sensational novel, so it was written with two purposes. The first was to shock its readership and the second was to make money. It has the obvious shock factor. The fact of what Lady Audley has done is incredibly shocking, and her true secret is even more surprising. To a Victorian audience this would have been scandalous. But, I don\u2019t feel that there\u2019s much beyond that. Yes, the plot had its moments, but literature like this needs more than an exciting plot. When I read a book like this I want to have emotions beyond a simple shocking; I want to see and feel the characters. But, I just couldn\u2019t. There was an element of emotional depth missing in this. I did like the detective aspects. They became quite thrilling. The exploration of the meaning of sanity was the most memorable thing of the novel. It follows the idea that it can be internalised and self-created. In the circumstance this was quite horrendous, but it was also an appropriate reaction. The Victorians didn\u2019t understand what could, and what could not, be inherited from our parents; thus, this character has practically devised their own fate through their pitiful ignorance. The stand offs between Robert Audley and Lady Audley were very tense. I was expecting to see something explosive happen after them: \n\n\u201cYou seem to have quite a taste for discussing these horrible subjects,\" she said, rather scornfully; \"you ought to have been a detective police officer.\"\"I sometimes think I should have been a good one.\"\"Why?\"\"Because I am patient.\u201d\n\nWell he has good reason to be..........(I'm saying no more)There was also the separate issue that my university insisted that we read it in periodical segments. We were to read a few chapters each week. I found this quite difficult. I read a lot of different books. So, to have a massive break like that between chapters meant that I\u2019d actually forgotten most of what happened the week before. I had to rely on plot summaries to remind myself of what actually had happened in the book. I seriously recommend avoiding this. Whilst it may be quaint to read it in the same manner of the Victorians, I know for a fact that it hindered my appreciation of the novel. I\u2019ve tried to be deliberately cryptic in my review. This book relies on its shock factor, and I didn\u2019t want to give anything away with a plot summary; it would spoil it. This was a thrilling read, the detective elements and the shock factors made it quite exciting, but I think this was mainly the case in the second volume. The third volume was very tense; however, the first volume felt very, very, flat. I did enjoy this, but I have no interest in reading anything else by this author."}, {"userName": "Sean", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5753689-sean", "userReview": "This is a sadly forgotten but great 19th century sensation novel that rivals some of Wilkie Collins' best books such as The Woman in White and the Moonstone.

Sortof likes ColdplayThe mid 1800s saw the rise of the sensation novel, which brought the spooky atmosphere of the Gothic into normal peoples' homes. Now the spouse (or other family member) was the danger. Anthony Trollope suggested that they should be \"at the same time realistic and sensational...and both in the highest degree.\" The most famous example is The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins; the other two pioneers are East Lynne by Ellen Wood and this book right here. The genre was immediately successful, and remains so today: if you liked Gone Girl, here is its grandmother.And sensational it is, chock full of intrigue and reversals and madness. (Victorian madness, with its gleeful disregard for the DSM.) Foreshadowing oozes out its sides like an overstuffed sandwich. Braddon addresses us directly, chatty, sarcastic, sometimes catty, often with what feels a little like misogyny. We're repeatedly reminded of \"the horrible things that have been done by women since that day upon which eve was created,\" and the \"feminine prevarication - [the] womanly trickery\" ladies are capable of. Hints of sympathy emerge: Lady Audley, she of the secret, knows what \"Every school-girl learns sooner or later - I learned that my ultimate fate in life depended upon my marriage.\" She has no way to better her situation except by marriage, and so she's forced to pursue it by any means necessary. But Braddon is no feminist.The characters are terrific. Phlegmatic Robert Audley drifts his way through the mystery, sighing about all the effort. He will learn seriousness, but not without trial: he'll be forced to smoke innumerable shitty cigars. Bratty Alice Audley (not Lady - her stepdaughter) - \"Such a nice girl, too, if she didn't bounce!\" - runs away with every scene she's in. Lady Audley herself is a mighty femme fatale. Braddon has a knack for great characters: there are memorable ones in her early detective novel Blood of the Serpent too. She shows an affinity for detective stories in both books.Braddon was very popular in her time, but she's faded now. You wonder why, right? This is a fun book, engaging and well-designed. It lacks something - an authority, a certainty, maybe? And it's not like there's a ton of doubt about how the mystery's going to be resolved. I can't make a super forceful case for re-elevating her. She's good, not great, for me. But I had a good time reading this book."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "Loved this...great fun. 4.5-stars, rounded down. As I read Lady Audley's Secret, I kept thinking of Poe, Conan Doyle and Anne Bronte. A nice combination, if I must say so myself. Braddon has created an interesting story line and a creepy environment in which to plunk down her motley set of characters. I loved the conflicting ideas that are present within Lady Audley herself and especially enjoyed the myriad ways she is viewed by the other characters in the story. Her secret did surprise me, and I confess I thought it would not. Braddon does a wonderful job of creating atmosphere and her descriptive passages are delightful and vivid. She plants red herrings and takes the mind into many dead-end suppositions. She made me laugh a little, but at the same time cringe. In the end, I loved both her story and the way it was delivered. While many things progressed in the novel exactly as I assumed they would, there were a few moments of complete surprise and that is always nice in this genre. I will not hesitate to read more of Braddon's work when I can fit it into my schedule."}, {"userName": "Piyangie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48056505-piyangie", "userReview": "Lady Audley's secret is yet another Victorian 'sensational' novel I read for the year. My first such experience was The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins. I have read that Collins and Ms. Braddon are known as the best authors of the genre and that Lady Audley's secret is regarded as a rival to The Woman in White. This knowledge made me want to read the book, and when a group to which I belong was intended upon reading this I couldn't resist the urge to join in. I'm very much glad that I did. Told by an unknown narrator, the story is focused on a secret of a woman named Lady Audley and the ultimate revelation of what this guarded secret is. When one reflects after the read, the story is a pretty simple and straight forward one. But the beauty lies in the twists and turns Ms. Braddon had so carefully employed to keep the reader guessing on what actually the secret is. She lays down clues and throws hints here and there without giving way too much and keeping the secret well-guarded until the time is right for a confession by Lady Audley. I found the writing of Ms. Braddon remarkable. There is so much beauty in her metaphoric prose. The subtle descriptions of a setting, a character or anything in general is so colourful that you are instantly transported to the time and setting of the story. Though her writing is a little verbose at times, this was balanced with the use of simple dialogues. The usage of such techniques made the read both interesting and quick. The set of characters used are quite unique and intriguing. The main male character, Robert Audley, is a young barrister. He is lazy and purposeless; but by fate, the discovery of Lady Audley's secret is forced on him. The story is both this discovery and Robert's struggle to gather clues and evidence towards this discovery at the risk of his own life. I really enjoyed reading how Robert's character was developed throughout the story. From an idling and purposeless life, he was slowly but steadily uplifted to a responsible and intellectually mature one. Throughout his journey to unveil the secret, he becomes determined and courageous and he finally understands his duties and responsibilities to his loved ones and to the society at large. I was very much impressed with his character development. While Robert Audley represented the detective, judge and the jury, and the executioner, the culprit was Lady Audley, a wicked and treacherous woman who uses her beauty to appease her mercenary intentions. Lady Audley is undoubtedly the most dangerous female villain I have come across. She is resourceful and has a surpassing strength of mind and she can only be compared to a demon in the guise of an angel. The battle between these two main characters that were in opposite ends was really intriguing. Throughout the read I was in the middle of a waging war waiting impatiently for the truth and justice to triumph. All the other characters were well placed and developed in the course of the story. They provided a well-structured backdrop for the story. Having read both The Woman in White and Lady Audley's Secret, I now understand why it is said that they rival each other. While The Woman in White touches on the male villainy against innocent and unprotected females, in Lady Audley's Secret the gender role is switched; here we find female villainy against the males. It is said that Ms. Braddon had admired The Woman in White but was not happy with the Collin's heroine. Since I have also heard that The Woman in White served as an inspiration for Ms. Braddon to pen Lady Audley's secret, I feel that Ms. Braddon has purposefully used a character who has an incredible strength of mind and who is resourceful as the female lead, though she represented evil. Both were great reads and I enjoyed both very much. I'm really glad that I came across these two books this year and they both have gained a position in my favourite classic shelf."}, {"userName": "Carol  \ua9c1\ua9c2 ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25867535-carol", "userReview": "[ The Hero telling The Villainess his plan of action (& not just once!) was inexplicable.

This was a highly entertaining and readable mystery - yes you'll guess some of what's going to happen but trust me the author has a red-herring or two and plenty of twists and turns ahead for the reader. Braddon's style was very light and readable, not as heavy handed as some 19C authors can be and I really enjoyed her descriptions of the settings, particularly the very very old Audley Court and its grounds.

However, reading to the end wasn't a chore, and the last fifty pages or so actually moved at a rapid pace. Good writing on the part of Braddon? Maybe I had just clued in to the fact that half of every page was description that neither served the plot nor gave symbolic depth ( as in \"And now we will discuss furniture as a Metaphor For Life,\" or \"The place was really run down, so I will describe it in hyperbole because hyperbole is clever\").Two major problems: The plot of the book often goes absolutely nowhere. Two thirds is Robert Audley wandering around, asking various stock characters about clues for Lucy Audley's past life. Which we already know everything about because of a chapter from her first husband's perspective early on. Pointless. What really makes a difference is how Lucy reacts to the slow disintegration of her plans and the raising of the stakes. But we don't get much of that, at least in the first two thirds of the book.Other major problem: I didn't care about any of the major characters, at least for the reasons you're supposed to care about them. Liked Alycia, really sympathized with her for getting an Evil Stepmother, being estranged from her father, and never being good enough for the man she loves. However, she doesn't do much and pretty much drops out of the picture in the last fifty pages.Robert Audley was a little interesting--as if Bertie Wooster had decided to become a serious detective. Someone who never does anything trying to do something and being completely out of his depth. However, he has no real character traits that make me root for him. As others on this site have pointed out, his friend George is shiftless and inconstant, and his love interest Clara appears for few scenes and is cardboard thin. His uncle's bland too. Robert seems to have some moment of conviction about the need to stop a woman's sin, but it just doesn't take, and feels shoehorned in by the author to make the tale more sensational.Lucy Audley was a character I've seen a million times before--the supposedly ideal woman and wife (older husband) who Uses Her Femininity to get what she wants. I only really became interested when she started to lose it--just seeing how she reacts to all the pressure put on her. I think the story would have worked better if it had been told entirely from Lucy's perspective and just focused on the one character instead of following Robert on his mind-bogglingly obvious interviews. There's a real Macbeth story going on here, where someone does something bad because, what the heck, they really really want to, and thinks \"Just this once doesn't make me evil. I won't do anything bad again.\" But then someone finds out and the person goes \"Oh, crap! Why do I have to keep doing more bad things to cover up the first one?\"But that's not the story Braddon wanted to tell or her audience wanted to hear. Set up an unnecessarily complicated cast of stock characters, develop none of them because the audience already knows how to pigeon hole them, throw in some long paragraphs of description that add nothing, don't forget your symbolism and literary allusions (they're like easter eggs full of chocolate that the readers just love to pick up, plus they make the author look smarter), and round out the story with some moralistic revelries (oops, reveries) that support societal norms--and you've got a Victorian novel people will be reading for years to come.

I quickly made a comparison to Trollope's An Old Man's Love which I note was written 20 years after the publication of Lady Audley's Secret. Braddon takes her old man/young woman in an entirely different direction - so different that, after the opening pages, I completely disregarded the comparison.Some GR readers have this shelved as gothic. To me, it falls somewhere between psychological fiction and gothic, sometimes more one than the other but never quite fitting either. There were brief passages where those critical of the flowery phrases of 19th Century fiction could be justified. Even I, who love 19th Century fiction, rolled my eyes on occasion. While it in no way ever resembles the spare and simplified prose which has become popular, this is quite readable. I was pleasantly surprised to find some quite decent characterization in what I expected to be simply a plot-driven novel. It is told mostly in third person ominipotent, but we spend a lot of time with one character, Robert Audley, and in that part we know little of what is going on with the other characters. Robert grows from who we think of as a man who lives only for his self-interest and a man with no purpose in life, to one with a single-mindedness of purpose and who looks out for the interest of others. And then there is this:\"...Why don't I love her? Why is it that although I know her to be pretty, and pure, and good, and truthful, I don't love her? Her image never haunts me, except reproachfully. I never see her in my dreams. I never wake up suddenly in the dead of the night with her eyes shining upon me and her warm breath upon my cheek, or with the fingers of her soft hand clinging to mine. No, I'm not in love with her, I can't fall in love with her.\"This, I believe, is Braddon's most well-known book, and it may be her best. I am more than willing to try others and see if that is correct. After about 50-60 pages, I couldn't wait to find time to put my nose in this book.

Certo \u00e8 che in quegli anni lei stessa aveva a che misurarsi con dei veri mostri sacri, primo tra tutti il sopra citato Wilkie Collins \u2013 impareggiabile autore della sensational novel, padre degli ingranaggi ricchi di colpi di scena e saturi di quella follia riscontrabile nello stesso \u201cIl segreto di Lady Audley\u201d.Ed \u00e8 proprio ne \u201cIl segreto di Lady Audley\u201d che l\u2019autrice stessa fa dire al suo protagonista Robert Audley \u201cNon ho letto Wilkie Collins e Alexandre Dumas per niente\u201d proprio quando egli sar\u00e0 quasi venuto a capo del tortuoso segreto della Lady del titolo, come a voler omaggiare i due grandi autori in un ultimo valzer prima dell\u2019epilogo."}, {"userName": "SmartBitches", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43581981-smartbitches", "userReview": "Full review at Smart Bitches, Trashy BooksI\u2019m going to pay Lady Audley\u2019s Secret the highest compliment I can pay a sensation novel: I kept finding great passages to bookmark but I didn\u2019t bookmark them because I didn\u2019t want to stop reading long enough to do so.That made for a great reading experience but it will make for a superficial review considering all the meaty stuff in this book that we could happily analyze for days if I had just slowed down long enough to use some post-it notes instead of flipping pages like a squirrel on cocaine.Regarding romance \u2013 there is romance, but as befits Gothic Noir, it\u2019s all pretty icky. Robert has a romance with George\u2019s angelic sister, and Alicia wants to have a romance with Robert, but Robert only sees her as a friend. Ostensibly that\u2019s because Alicia is too much of a tomboy for Robert, who prefers to date angelic women who look just like his best guy friend. The modern reader will note that Robert and Alicia are also first cousins, but that was not unusual at the time.What keeps this book fun is the feeling that the reader never knows what move is coming next. What makes the book interesting is that every character\u2019s true self becomes revealed, not only to the readers but also to themselves. It\u2019s a story of fa\u00e7ade versus reality, even in the case of minor characters. Lady Audley is not the only one with a secret! The novel is available in paperback or for .99 on Amazon (Ebook price). It\u2019s not a romance, but I think fans of Victorian literature will love it as will readers who love crazysauce plots, noir, mysteries, the gothic style, and swooning.

Braddon makes use of many of the tropes of the 'sensation' novel but gives them some additional twists of her own, especially with regard to gender stereotypes. It's no surprise that Dickens, Thackeray and the young Henry James were all fans - an intriguing read with clear precedents that lead forward to today's 'psychological' thrillers."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley", "userReview": "This was a well-structured, well-written drama with hints of deceit, which makes for a fantastic Gothic Victorian novel. It echoed Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte, and the story-line / writing style was very reminiscent of \u2018My Cousin Rachel,\u2019 and \u2018The Go-Between.\u2019 I really enjoyed reading a novel that was written in such formal language, as it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve read an old classic\u2026 and I was starting to miss it. I was also very intrigued by the characters and the setting and the story itself. Even though its miniscule font took me centuries to get through, at times it was difficult to put this book down.My sole complaint would be, as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, that it was kind of predictable from the beginning. As a mystery novel, it failed to provide a stimulating, thrilling secret for the reader to contemplate. But as a drama, it soared. I would even argue that the purpose of this book was not to create a mystery, but to emphasize the challenges of the time and to pinpoint the causes of horrible acts. The themes of female domesticity, lack of female agency, and the conflict caused by traditional definitions of status / wealth, were subtly incorporated into the plot. I was amazed to realize how much I was willing to pity the extremely flawed men in this tale, thanks to a biased, omniscient narrator that favours a perspective set against the women; these women having struggled against the obstacles imposed upon them by the patriarchy; these women having manipulated the patriarchy to the best of their abilities in order to survive comfortably in it.And I think this novel must have showed misogynistic Victorian men that complex, self-serving, and morally ambiguous women are a force to be reckoned with. They, at the very least, make for some thrilling drama. Miss Alicia with her desire for more than the typical male suitor, Phoebe Marks with her domestic troubles, and Lady Audley herself with her need to create a life for herself, a life with comfort and security and maybe a few sacrifices along the way\u2026Old-fashioned Robert Audley, the main character, seemed out of place in this world where women were demanding, and manipulative, and had the upper hand. His misogynistic views, his determination against sympathizing with the plight of women, and his insistence on judging women based on how well they played into stereotypes -- all this made Braddon's point abundantly clear: women cannot be categorized or controlled, and furthermore, men at some point need to make an effort to have a deeper, more contemporary understanding of them. And furthermore, poverty and subjugation only breeds desperation.I loved the female stereotypes called into question: the enchantress, the mad woman, the conniving wife, the fragile, child-like damsel, the materialistic step-mother\u2026 And what an accomplishment that Braddon wrote one character to embody all of these tropes: a woman who, in the end, turned out to be quite within reason.Mixing elements of 'Fingersmith,' 'My Cousin Rachel,' and 'The Go-Between,' this is a sensational drama for classic lit readers. If you\u2019re a fan of Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, or the Brontes, Lady Audley\u2019s Secret will surely appeal to your tastes. What a joy to read."}, {"userName": "Kathrin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7359792-kathrin", "userReview": "I don't think that I would have picked up the book if it hadn't been a group read on Goodreads - but this is mainly based on my ignorance when it came to the author. I believe it was a really good choice and was fascinated with the story a long time. Obviously, there is a 'but'. Just let me point out a few positive aspects earlier:What did I like about the book?- the pacing (especially in the first part) was great Ever since reading 'The Woman in White' I was determined to come back and read another sensational novel. It's an entertaining read because there is always a lot going on. Yes, you might get the impression that the story is rushed because literally, anyone seems to have a hidden agenda and is planning and plotting away. I, however, like this kind of story. - I love the settingVictorian England is a thing I can hardly turn away and I enjoy my stay in almost all cases. The descriptions in the book were lovely. In the course of the story, a place might change according to whatever happened there. The author did a great job of creating a fitting atmosphere. - Awesome writing styleIt's a shame that the author is more known nowadays. Her narrative suits the story and it's pretty easy to get lost in it. I'm also a big fan of her portraying of Lady Audley and revealing her secret. There are numerous points in the story when you believe you have everything figured out but it will actually take until the very end to reveal everything. So, let's look for the 'but'. As much as I was a fan of Lady Audley, I didn't like Robert Audley. Unfortunately, he took up quite some space in the novel and I got bored of him. I liked the effort of integrating bits of a detective story but it just didn't work for me. His narrative was lost on me. Looking back, this might be the reason why it took me so long to finish the book. Anyway, I believe he was the only downside. I don't want to give away too much about the book - it's dripping social anxiety all over and offers some of the best (female) villains that I've read in a while. Great read! My recommendation goes to fans of 'The Woman in White' and if you haven't read a sensational novel before, you might want to give this one a try."}, {"userName": "Mo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13030645-mo", "userReview": "This was a very interesting story, but I am torn as to whether or not it was a good book. It most certainly was a very long-winded one.I quickly grew tired of Robert\u2019s continual angst! The soul searching, the breast beating, the second guessing\u2026 it went on and on. And George\u2019s continual lamentations of his lost love were completely overdone. Talk about beating a dead horse!I jokingly wondered if the author was being paid by the word, and it turns out that she was! This book was originally partially serialized in Robin Goodfellow Magazine, then entirely serialized in Six Penny Magazine. Although to be strictly accurate, it was most likely that she was paid per installment, not actually per word. Charles Dickens first popularized this format, and it remained popular throughout the Victorian era. Many authors of her day published their works first in serial form. (Only later was Lady Audley\u2019s Secret published as a three volume novel).The verbosity ultimately became too much for me, and I had to skim the last hundred pages. I was very glad to have finished the book.NOTE: All of the comments attached to this book stem from a buddy read with my sister, and contain spoilers."}, {"userName": "Trisha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4280826-trisha", "userReview": "In this strangely swirling tale, Lucy, a governess, marries Sir Michael Audley, a much wealthier man. It is their story. Simultaneously, Robert Audley reunites with an old friend, George, recently returned from Australia and looking for a happy homecoming with his wife. It is their story. And it is the marriage of these two stories that really sets off the mystery.This is one of those books that is difficult to talk about for fear of revealing anything that will be more exciting if revealed by the text. Of course, the mystery itself is actually not much of a mystery in my opinion. I - and I think most readers - knew very early on what Lady Audley's secret is. Sort of like Victoria's secret, Lady Audley's is not exactly well hidden. What is so intriguing about this tale is not the mystery, it's watching Robert decide if he wants to actually solve it and it's contemplating Lady Audley's actual culpability and motivation. Despite the relative obviousness of the text's twists, the novel remains suspenseful throughout, and I was flipping the pages as fast as I could without losing the intricacies of the plot."}, {"userName": "MichelleCH", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379606-michellech", "userReview": "I've read my fill of mystery/suspense stories and I must say that this was one of the better ones, in my opinion. Although it was published in the mid 1800's, the story line still felt fresh. Lots of build- up and even midway through I was not knowing where we would go next. I don't want to say too much, as to what happens, as \"the secret\" is the primary focus of the novel.What I can say is that I was kept guessing throughout. There was one point in the book where I thought something was going to happen and I had to hold my breath and keep turning pages. My guess was wrong, which I was happy to see.The main characters were diverse and Lady Audley was portrayed perfectly; I would loved to see a photo of her. She is described as being incredibly beautiful, childish and doll-like, Robert Audley who plays the detective reminded me of a young Bruce Willis, laid-back, witty and forever the bachelor.This was a very enjoyable, quick read and I will be checking out more of Braddon's work.

Not only does it reflect the mode and style of \"scandal\" novels of its period, but it also displays excellent word craft. She wrote in the 1860's speech patterns and mannerly long phrasings- quite sublimely. The plot is apparent to a modern reader and yet the depths of the character and personality detailing make it well worth the read. George and Robert seem superbly of one piece with their period, IMHO. Quite the study- for both of them. Even better than the main centerpiece of our story, the stunning but never simple Lady Baronet."}], "description": "This Victorian bestseller, along with Braddon's other famous novel, Aurora Floyd, established her as the main rival of the master of the sensational novel, Wilkie Collins.
