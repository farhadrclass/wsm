I know, I know--Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character. But despite this, despite being a man born of the imagination rather than the flesh, Sherlock has always operated within the real world. The cases he solves, while appearing supernatural at times, always have a solution that is down-to-earth. That was not the case with The Patchwork Devil, and if you don't like material that diverges from the original in such a fantastic way, you probably won't like Cavan Scott's addition to the Sherlock Holmes universe.That aside, The Patchwork Devil was well written, if not predictable. I'm a total sucker for the Holmes-Watson camaraderie, and Scott more than spoils the reader in this regard."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1492392-rose", "userReview": "Man, I really liked this one. It ticks a lot of my pastiche boxes; most especially, that it's set in 1919 (putting it firmly in \"His Last Bow\" territory, which always delights me). Not enough has been written of Holmes and Watson's adventures in the era of WWI and after, perhaps because Conan Doyle established that Holmes retires and moved to Sussex at the end of his detecting career. But of course, for Holmes, detecting is a calling, not just a profession; and Conan Doyle himself wrote a couple of stories about the Great Detective following the threads of a mystery even after Holmes's retirement. Pastiches featuring an older Holmes and Watson are favorites of mine, and I was thrilled to find one as enjoyable as this.While there is, as others have noted, a definite sense of science fiction to this read (especially towards the end), this book is a true adventure novel. I don't mean to knock the mystery of the book -- because there is so clearly a mystery, and an engaging one at that -- but there's a lot of chasing and confronting and perilous escapes; it is, indeed, an _adventure_. That's not to say we don't have plenty of time for character development. I loved watching Watson struggle to decide how much Holmes was still a part of his life, and how much he wanted him to be; I loved watching Holmes struggle to reconcile the known with the unknowable. (Damn, those last two paragraph are crackerjack; I can't remember the last time an ending line so pleased me.) These are real people here, real _friends_, and I loved seeing that friendship so wonderfully displayed.One especial note: I get frustrated with pastiches and adaptations that portray Sherlock Holmes as flawless. It drives me particularly batty when a story will have Holmes getting physically injured or emotionally bested, only to have him turn around in a few scenes and go, \"Oh, ha ha, I wasn't hurt/debilitated/in danger at all! That was all an act, a disguise! It actually fit into my plan all along!! I was in complete control of the situation the whole time!\" People seem to forget that Conan Doyle had the Great Detective fail on several notable occasions, and it doesn't seem to occur to writers that having a faultless character who is always two steps ahead of the villain makes for less-than-dramatic reading. How can there be any tension, or indeed any real triumph, if Holmes is always in complete, superhuman control of all aspects of the situation? So I really appreciated Scott's balance here: when Holmes got hurt, he was _hurt_, and if he was still able to rally to continue pursuing the case, it did not undo the stakes because, y'know, the _stakes actually existed_. (This, of course, makes it MORE impressive when Holmes wins the day, because he's doing so against stacked odds. When your hero is in perfect control of every detail the entire time, it's much less impressive, and I appreciate that Scott _got_ that.)I recommend this one especially to fans of the Downey-and-Law Holmes & Watson duo, because the banter between Scott's Holmes and Watson put me so in mind of the sibling-like friendship between Downey and Law's takes on the characters. I hope this isn't the last Holmesian pastiche from Mr. Scott."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13752173-sarah", "userReview": "I would first like to say thank you for Titan publishing for listing this give away and allow me to read this bookWith any characters as famous as Sherlock Holmes there will always be some skepticism over what they will do. I felt to begin with that Scott hadn't quite grasped the Sherlock Holmes that everyone is used to however I was soon proven wrong. Scott pushes the boundaries of what a Sherlock novel would usually entail whilst retaining the traditional characters see in Arthur Conan Doyle's work. Whilst I enjoyed this more unconventional plot I am not sure whether this would appeal to everyone, never the less I would encourage any fans of the original books to take a look at this book"}, {"userName": "Chris Apolant", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44636112-chris-apolant", "userReview": "This is a tricky one to review, because while very well written and engaging on many levels, even despite the suspension of disbelief element, it wasn't a bad story at all. Predictable, yes, but also fast paced and exciting. However, the characterizations left so much to be desired, and the arguing between every character at some point that went beyond the normal creation of conflict in any given work of fiction was just grating in the extreme. Watson (who needed a dose of Midol throughout) was constantly at odds with Holmes, Mycroft, and even with his wife. Overall, I felt that while the story was good, it went no way in capturing the feel of one of the greatest friendships in all literature, and was decidedly not a pastiche."}, {"userName": "Eukaryote", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6388405-eukaryote", "userReview": "[Unwind (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Mabji", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66737341-mabji", "userReview": "Und wieder ein extrem spannender Sherlock-Fall!Es scheint fast, als k\u00f6nnte man mit den Titan Books - Reihen einfach nichts falsch machen.Besonders mag ich dsa halboffene Ende, ist das Monster nun tod?

Holmes and Watson are retired men now, each having gone their separate ways. It is during one of Sherlock\u2019s visits to London however that the two are called back in to action.A severed hand has been found along the bank of the Thames. Fingerprints show the hand belongs to a young soldier who supposedly died in France \u2013 two years earlier. Yet the hand found is fresh and looks as if it were recently amputated. So how did it end up back in England when its owner was killed half a continent away? And what of the strange giant seen following them?I am always pleased when a book manages to surprise me. Whether it be from how a character acts to a plot twist no one sees coming; I enjoy them all. So I\u2019m sure you can imagine my surprise and delight, dear reader, when I came across a book that is a combination of two of my favorite stories \u2013 Sherlock Holmes and Frankenstein.Just going by the blurb on the back of the book, I already had an inkling that the plot of The Patchwork Devil would likely hint at the original Frankenstein. A person or persons seeking to create life where once there was none, for whatever purpose. So I\u2019m sure you can imagine my surprise (and delight) when during the course of their investigation, Holmes and Watson learn that their main suspect is a descendant of Viktor Frankenstein and has seemingly picked up his work!Alas, to say much more would be to give away important spoilers so dear reader, I shall have to stop there.Scott has done admirable work in giving a voice to older Holmes and Watson. There were several moments that had me smiling as the men attempted things that were possible in their younger days only to suffer the consequences and realize getting old is difficult! He also did excellent work with the character of Frankenstein\u2019s monster. Those who read the original book know that he is an eloquent character, well spoken and quite intelligent. Unfortunately the movies (and sometimes books) have cast him as a shambling individual with a childlike intellect. Scott has reminded us that that man was anything but.If I have any qualms with The Patchwork Devil, it would be how quickly everything was resolved. The whole mystery and bad guy were dealt with in what seemed like a matter of paragraphs. It felt a bit too rushed to my taste.Other than that, I rather enjoyed this most recent Holmes tale. Readers like myself and those who like a good medical mystery will likely enjoy it as well."}, {"userName": "Dale", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31434347-dale", "userReview": "The fresh hand of man dead for two years...I will put up a SPOILERS ALERT warning although I will try to not ruin the book for anyone. It is simply common courtesy, and I have been taken to task for not giving warning too often!The year is 1919. Sherlock Holmes is visiting at Dr. and Mrs. Watson\u2019s home. One thing I should add is that at no time does the author give the name of the second wife. Mrs. Watson has less patience with Holmes than Mary Watson had. So it is far from pleasing when Holmes and Watson get into another case\u2026While solving the problems and old friend of Holmes\u2019 is having with his nephew, Holmes and Watson manage to get in a fight. Holmes agrees that he has presumed on Watson\u2019s good nature enough, and he is planning to return home.Inspector Tovey arrives at Watson\u2019s home before Holmes has left for his train. There are unwritten adventures involving Tovey mentioned, and it is plain that this is not their first meeting. The Inspector is seeking Holmes\u2019 help once more.By now Holmes and Watson have patched things up, and agree to aid Tovey. The Inspection states that a hand has washed up on the banks of the Thames near Tower Bridge. This would usually not be strange, but fingerprints prove it to belong to a man killed in WWI. He had part of his head blown off and was definitely dead. But this hand is fresh, and there are surgical sutures holding the hand to the arm, which has been sawn off perhaps four inches above the wrist\u2026The harrowing tale winds from the bank of the Thames, through an abandoned Hospital, to consultation with a Doctor who specializes in treatment of a rare bone disorder, to Germany, and beyond. Along the way Holmes and Watson will risk life and limb searching for the origins of what could be termed \u201cpatchwork devils,\u201d while being tracked by a series of unusual agents\u2014who may or may not have interest in the successful conclusion of this mystery\u2026I give the book five stars!
