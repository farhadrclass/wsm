He is so lonely and broken that I wanted him to be what Rose was looking for. Luckily I came to like Rose and Declan together but still poor William left to go into hiding and had no one. Cerise on the other hand has a huge family living in the swamp between worlds and every single one of them seems a little on the crazy side, so she should have no trouble taming Lord William\u2026right?\n \u201cWhy couldn't she have gotten another Edger or some dimwit from the Broken for a passenger? No, she got Lord Leather Pants here.\u201d\nThe snarky humor between Cerise and William was fantastic. She comes from a large family and is trying to save their land after he parents have been kidnapped by an organization of magically mutated beings. William is trying to find the same beings to take out their leader once and for all. But just because their goals line up doesn\u2019t mean that everything else does right away.\n\u201cWilliam strode to her. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done. Drink it in.She surveyed the carnage behind him. \u201cDid you have fun?\u201dHe showed her his teeth. \u201cYes. Now they won\u2019t take you anywhere.\u201dCerise stepped closer to him, so close he only needed to lean in and dip his head and he would kiss her. Since he saved her, maybe he could just grab her and\u2014\u201cThat was the stupidest thing you have done since I\u2019ve met you,\u201d she ground out through her teeth.Belay the grabbing.\u201d\nCerise is a strong heroine. She is easy to like because everything she does is for her crazy family and she has no time or inclination for angst or drama. William is drawn to the woman she it right away and one that doesn\u2019t even want to be saved by him, it is a confusing thing.The enemy is even greater than in On the Edge as the magically mutated Hand operatives are searching for Cerise and doing unspeakable things to the parents they abducted from her. Spider is truly horrible and a great bad guy as he sees nothing wrong with what he is doing, I loved hating him.One of the things I liked the best about this book was Cerise\u2019s family. They were funny and a handful. Her grandmother the wise and knowing was full of mischief and Kaldar making absurd bets because that is how his magic worked trying to marry Cerise off. The clan was full of mischievous characters that added all kinds of fun. \n\u201cHow did the hearing go?\u201d she asked.\u201cWe won, sort of,\u201d Kaldar said. \u201cWe die at dawn.\u201d\u201cThe court gave the Sheeriles twenty-four hours,\u201d William corrected.\u201cYes, but \u2018we die at dawn the day after tomorrow\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound nearlyas dramatic.\u201d\u201cDoes it have to be dramatic all the time?\u201d Catherine murmured.\u201cOf course. Everyone has a talent. Yours is crocheting and mine ismaking melodramatic statements.\u201d\nThe feud between the families seemed almost of Hatfield and Maccoy standards in its duration and fallout, with a few more laughs maybe. Kaldar was an interesting character and the Hero of the next book. I\u2019m interested to see what kind of trouble he can get into, he seems a very mischievous man indeed.There wasn\u2019t a lot of time needed for world set up so the story flowed much better from the first book. Everything about this magic system and the characters in it is really growing on me. I enjoyed seeing Jack and George a few years later along with Declan and Rose.If you like Ilona Andrews then I\u2019m sure you will be able to find something in this that you love. Kate Daniels is still my favorite series of theirs so if you have already read that might as well try out this world too."}, {"userName": "Carol.

On the Edge went well, though it seemed a bit Kate Daniels Lite--milk chocolate version. Bayou Moon, on the other hand, is Kate Daniels Special Dark--dark chocolate version.It begins with William, the wolf-shape changer from On the Edge. It's a couple years later and he's hanging in the Broken, working flooring jobs and drinking beer. A noble from the Weird comes to see him and enlist him in the cause to bring down the lead spymaster for the opposing team. William's unable to resist the offer, as he's been on William's personal to-kill list for years. At the same time, Cerise is working to keep her family's fiances together when her parents disappear. They live in a multi-generation household in The Mire, an Edge area known for extensive swamps and a very insular lifestyle. Apparently the family's arch-enemies have decided to re-open the feud by laying claim to her grandparent's old house. She needs to journey to the Broken to retrieve some documents. Her return trip and William's entry into the Mire coincide. They work together to navigate the Mire, and on their respective missions, dancing around their attraction for each other.Narrative flows fairly smoothly, largely with alternating viewpoints between William and Cerise, with occasional intrusions by the Spymaster. Plot moves fairly fast and is generally straightforward, with heavy emphasis on action scenes. There is a significant amount of physical fighting in this book with particular techniques described.The setting is clearly modeled on the marshy, changeable waterways of deep swamps and is always atmospheric. Both William and Cerise have a connection to the natural world, although for different reasons, and their likes and dislikes of the area help bring it alive. The world-building is generally solid with more focus on the weird creatures than on personal magic or spells. However, there's some mutation-type magic employed by the Spymaster and his country that adds a fearsome, freaky angle to the story. There's some mildly confusing Weird politics between the two countries and their spy agencies, the Hand and the Mirror, that play into the reasons for hunting the Spymaster. It's awkwardly integrated largely because William and Cerise are generally apolitical and insular, although for different reasons.As always with Andrews, characterization and characters stand out. William's dual nature is given a realistic feel as he continually works to understand human cues and maintain 'normal' responses (much like many introverted people, I might add). Cerise's extended family is very idiosyncratic with enough development to make the reader unsure of allegiance, and even those with brief appearances provide interest. Unlike the Kate Daniels series, body count of both friend and foe is high--these are life-and-death matters, so there's an appropriate cost. It might be a shock to those fans of Daniels who rarely encounter a death of characters on the side of 'good.'For me, it was a solid diversion. I wanted an immersive read in an interesting world without intellectual or emotional commitment. For fans of romance, I'm not entirely sure it would satisfy; because both Cerise and William are who they are, it takes a long time for them to acknowledge their mutual attraction. On the other hand, as a non-romance reader, I appreciated the relatively uncomplicated romance structure. It also has almost equal emphasis on action/fighting. Overall, enjoyable and slightly more intriguing than On the Edge.Three and a half dark chocolate kisses."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "In this second volume of THE EDGE series Ilona Andrews dives full-on into bayou urban fantasy realness. The Edge is a semi-magical border land between our normal world and an alternative version called the Weird, with kingdoms, swords and magic - both good and highly evil. Cerise Mar is part of the Mar clan, a powerful family in the Mire, a swampland in the Edge where family vendettas are a way of life. When Cerise's parents disappear, it seems like it's part of the ongoing feud between the Mars and the Sheerlies. But behind the Sheerlies is the corrupt Kingdom of Louisiana and a ruthless agent of the Hand called Spider, with a grotesque and magically powerful crew. And coming after Spider is William, a former soldier, shapeshifter and agent of the rival kingdom of Adrianglia. When William meets Cerise, sparks fly, but there's the not insignificant distraction of trying to find Cerise's parents and, by the way, avoid getting killed or captured by Spider, who has a hidden purpose for going after the Mars clan. As always with the Andrews' books, the plot is highly imaginative and action-filled, with a heavy side of hot romance.\"If I don't let you in, will you huff and puff and blow my house down?\"She had no idea. \"I'm more of a kick the door open and cut everyone inside to ribbons kind of wolf.\u201dWilliam definitely has a wild wolf side. The broken side of William the Wolf is well-depicted, though, and my heart ached for the generations-long bayou feud, the way it was used by the dark forces of the Hand, and the devastating effects on the families on both sides of the feud.I think I liked the first book, On the Edge, a little better ... and by the way, it's great fun when Cerise meets up with Rose from that book.\u201cMy youngest brother killed a lynx yesterday,\u201d Rose said. \u201cApparently it came into his territory and left some spray marks. He skinned it, smeared himself in its blood, and put its pelt on his shoulders like a cape. And that\u2019s how he came dressed for breakfast.\u201d Cerise drank some beer. \u201cMy sister kills small animals and hangs their corpses on a tree, because she thinks she is a monster and she\u2019s convinced we\u2019ll eventually banish her from the house. They\u2019re her rations. Just in case.\u201dRose blinked. \u201cI see. I think we\u2019re going to get along just \ufb01ne, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI think so, yes.\u201dAs soon as I finished Bayou Moon, though, which was sometime after 1 am, I went searching on Abebooks (my favorite online used bookseller) and ordered the next two books in this series. It may be brain candy, but it's really good brain candy, and it's got some emotional and intellectual heft to it."}, {"userName": "Jessica \u2741 \u27b3 Silverbow \u27b3 \u2741 Rabid Reads-no-more", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336538-jessica-silverbow-rabid-reads-no-more", "userReview": "So here's the problem with Ilona rereads--I have a vague recollection of not liking this book as much as I usually like an Ilona book (still liked it, of course, but I think we've established that Ilona operates under a different set of standards), but I cannot, for the life of me, remember why . . . Not much of a problem, I know (that's the point).So we're back in the Edge. With William this time.<-----that's right, there's a POV change. FYI.Two years have passed since we were last in the Edge, and it looks like William has just been sitting around, working construction in the Broken, and generally feeling sorry for himself.Not that he doesn't have good cause. He's had a crap life so far, and Rose rejected him to go live in the Weird with Declan . . . Poor William. *rolls eyes*But when a representative of the Mirror (Adrianglia's version of the CIA) shows up on William's doorstep with evidence that his most loathed enemy (Spider) is slaughtering changeling children again (yes, again), he agrees to go undercover into the Mire, a nasty, swamp-like area of the Edge, to snatch whatever Spider is looking for, and hand it over to the Mirror.Spider, you see, is an agent for the Hand (the Dukedom of Louisiana's version of the CIA), and Adrianglia and DoL are too evenly matched to engage in open warfare without massive losses on both sides, so instead they fight their war with spies and covert operations.<-----AWESOME.The Mirror doesn't know what Spider is after, but anything the Hand wants as badly as it seems too, the Mirror will do everything in their power to keep from them. Even send in a changeling like William.Cerise Mar has lived in the Mire all her life. The Mire is a savage place, even for Edgers, and Cerise is a Mar, and the Mars are a force to be reckoned with. Her family is land rich and cash poor, and there are a LOT of them. Cerise's father has been the Head of the family since the previous Head, his elder brother, was shot in the head (insert bad pun), by a rival family, in the middle of the \"town\" square.YEP. We have a Hatfields and McCoys-type situation. YEE-haaaaaww, once again.The 80+ year long feud has been quiet since the public shooting incident, but when Cerise's mother and father disappear (McCoys), and Lagar Sherrile (Hatfield) and co. are found occupying her Grandfather's abandoned home, and claiming that her father sold the property to him, oh, and here's the deed to prove it, and no, he has no idea where her parents got to, an escalation in hostilities is inevitable. But before Cerise leaves to regroup with her family, Lagar lets slip that the Hand is involved, and suggests that she be a good, little girl, and let the issue drop.Riiiiight. But what does the Hand want with her parents?I really did like this installment a LOT. The Mars are a crazy and hilarious bunch that you can't help but love. Lark, Kaldar, and Aunt Murid especially. Grandma Az is pretty great too. And they are exactly what William has always longed for.<-----the FEELS.This installment is also where a definitive story arc takes shape: the quietly fought war between Adrianglia and the Dukedom of Louisiana. And people . . . the DoL fights dirty and creepily. One of my favorite things about Clean Sweep was the sci-fi explanations for supernatural creatures. Werewolves were the result of genetic modification of soldiers on a planet at war. The Hand uses magic for a similar purpose. They \"fuse\" operatives with plants and other things to give them enhancements, but it's a tricky \"science\" and things don't always go as expected. One universal side effect, however, is that the experimentees can no longer be considered human when the process is complete. Neither in appearance, nor behavior.Basically Bayou Moon is both creepy and awesome. William and Cerise are wonderful together, and William's changeling antics throughout their \"courtship\" are wildly (HA!) entertaining. Spider is truly diabolical (be warned--there are moments of graphic violence in this series), and you will BURN in your desire to see him defeated, and the Edge and the Weird both suck you into the oddities of their worlds. No book 2 slump here, people. Not. At.

You know those romance series that each book is about a character that we met somewhere in the first/previous book? I'm not a fan. But well, I didn't need to. It's Ilona Andrews and she has yet to disappoint me. I really enjoyed this book, maybe not as much as On the Edge but still a lot. I'm interested in reading Kaldar's story. He sounds fun and cool. He's my favorite of Cerise's family.I'm not a romance fan. Thankfully, Bayou Moon didn't focus only on the romance between William (I loved him since we met him in the first book) and Cerise (wish she had a different name, I hate those that have an obvious meaning in another/same language). Her family is awesome, kinda reminds me of mine because we are a big crazy family that always sticks together. I was also very happy when we saw Jack and George! I adore these too! I'm honestly trying to finish this series asap to read Clean Sweep but would've continued it nonetheless. Some might think this book was longer than necessary, I kinda agree but I didn't mind. Well, if I knew it's around 450 pages previously, I wouldn't have started reading it since I have to study at the moment. Sadly, I didn't and here I am read it in 2 days while holding my political science book in my other hand. I had fun reading this book and hope the next would be as good. I don't think any will match On the Edge but it's okay, as long as it's enjoyable and quick to read.If you liked On the Edge, you definitely should read this book. If you haven't read any of Ilona Andrews's books then WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!!!!!!!!! Her books are the best discovery of 2017 for me! I've waited too long to read her books but better late than never. So yeah, go read one of her novels, Kate Daniels preferably because you are missing A LOT."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "3.5 starsIs there such a thing as a bad Ilona Andrews book?Nah.This maybe wasn't my favorite, but, to me, these guys always write a quality story. Even if it isn't mind-blowing, it's still like chocolate to me. Is some chocolate better than other chocolate?Yes, of course! But any chocolate is still chocolate. Delicious, delicious chocolate...And that's how I felt about Bayou Moon. Not my favorite, but it filled my craving for an Ilona book.*shrugs*If you've read the 1st Edge novel then you might remember Declan's friend, William. The one who had the hots for Rose in the beginning? Well, he's the main man in this sucker.Which, was a serious surprise for me! I mean, I didn't realize that these novels were all going to feature different characters. So, technically, this is a stand-alone. Sure, it would be cool if you read On the Edge first, but you don't have to read it. But I liked the 1st one better, so I'd suggest you read it!William gets recruited by a magical MI6 (ish) agency, to help catch a bad guy called The Spider. He's a real creepy dude, and there's a nasty history between him & William that tips the scales in favor of working for the agency.Meanwhile, Cerise is dealing with paranormal fighting with a neighboring clan in the Edge. Yeah, like a swampy Hatfield & McCoy feud with magic...Because this is a romance, Cerise & William get thrown together (conveniently) and have to stick together to fight their (conveniently) common enemy.Ah, who am I kidding? Andrews wrote it, so I enjoyed it.I really like Cerise, but something about William just didn't make me swoon. He was a good guy underneath it all, but it seemed like (because he was a changeling) his emotions were a bit off. Not enough for me to avidly dislike him, but not enough for me to fall in love, either. But the story was solid, the characters felt real, and I already have the next book on hold at my library.I'd say this one is good if you need a quick fix till the next Kate Daniels book comes out!Also reviewed for:"}, {"userName": "Jo \u2605The Book Sloth\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13870608-jo-the-book-sloth", "userReview": "5 IA Can Do No Wrong StarsRe-read with the awesome IAA gang.I was sooooooooooo late for this.

Once again I loved her book. William was... Well Meg Ryan can show you!Cerise...Cerise was a very likable heroine. She is smart, responsible, loyal and pretty. I like the fact that although IA gives her heroines sth to make them stand out she never makes them \"THE SHIT\", someone that is so unique that you have to take notice so it is natural for the hero to fall for them. Instead they are everyday girls(in their world) and what makes them stand out is their personality, not their \"unique\" powers. William...I loved William since I first read about him in the first book and kept on loving him throughout this one. William is a combination of confidence and insecurities. He is smart but doesn't think exactly like a human, sometimes he was like a little boy and you wanted to cuddle him and then he would be all hot and sexy. I loved Declan in the first book too but for completely different reasons...The story was good although it dragged out a bit in places but not enough to take anything out of Andrews' awesomeness. It was well-written and full of action and luckily once again although it was a big part of the story, the romance came second. I didn't want it to end.Now I could start raving about all the things I loved in this book but I would need hours and I'm too bored.

He is a very cool character that more or less stole the show from the hero in On the Edge. Not that Declan wasn't a perfectly good hero. Well, he was a bit more 'golden boy' than I like my heroes. But he worked for Rose. As for personal taste, I go with William!  What can I say? I like 'em edgy. I appreciated how the Andrews shaped Williams character and showed all his textures and layers. One would think that a changeling would be a pretty basic guy, all id. Not William. He has a dichotomy, although he does aim for simplicity in his actions and thought processes. And wonderfully self-controlled, considering. He had to learn it the hard way, which is organic. I think he was very true to his nature. He had that primal, violent aspect, but also a loving, sensual (and not just in an erotic) nature. Although he had never been part of a family, you could see that he valued and treasured the concept of family. I especially liked how he reacted to Cherise. Just on a primal level, he fell for her and 'knew' she was meant for his. Even with that instant feeling, nothing was guaranteed in the story. There was a long journey for them, and that love story adds to but doesn't take away from this distinctly gritty fantasy read. Although I will put this on my urban fantasy shelf, I guess it really isn't UF. It's more like rural fantasy. Hey, would love more books in this sub-genre!Speaking of rural fantasy, I loved the local color. With On the Edge, that was a major appeal of the story, the down-home Southern ambience of the story. This story goes even deeper. This is about swamp people. It felt very authentic and real. I think we can all identify with having an interesting family. How we have various relations that are just kind of odd, but we love and accept them because they are family. That's this book in a nutshell. Cerise's family was full of characters, each one distinctive. They gave her a headache and sometimes a heartbreak, but they were blood, and blood is thicker than water. So what if her family has some folks that aren't strictly human? Every family has quirks. I loved Cerise's loyalty to her family, and better yet, that William could respect that and realized that his Mate's family was his family now.As far as adventure and action, this book has it in spades. As with other books by Andrews, it can be gritty and gory. The whole storyline about the scientific/magical adaptations was rather stomach-churning! If you're squeamish, you might not want to eat while reading some parts. William is seriously awesome as far as his warrior skills, and Cerise more than holds her own. In fact, she rocks the house. She's a tough, strong woman, the kind of woman you want to high five. Despite being tough, she has some vulnerabilities that give her a realistic portrayal. I could identify with her love of family but her feeling of being trapped by obligations. I liked her a lot. On top of her emotional and mental fortitude, Cerise is an incredible swordswoman, which definitely works for me, because I love swordplay. I also liked that her family is full of tough guys, of both sexes. Particularly, liked Kaldar and Aunt Marid, and little Lark. Let's not forget Gaston. But all in all, quite a brood, the Mars!This was a long book, for sure, but there wasn't filler. I think moreso that there was a lot of story to be told, and no need to cut some of it out. We got William's fully-fleshed story and I loved it. Although I fully adored On the Edge, I love this in a different way. I think that's a great progression for a series, that each one feels different, although it captures what I love about Ilona Andrews' writing and stays true to their voice.Now I'm wondering what these folks can get up to next in the Edge, Weird, and Broken, or all of the above! Glad there are more books in this series to read!"}, {"userName": "new_user", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1365355-new-user", "userReview": "I had too-high hopes for Bayou Moon. That must be it, right?I've been anticipating Moon since On the Edge. William's wolfy thought-processes are endearing, and he's just vulnerable enough without stepping into woe-is-me territory, even if he does think to himself one time too many that he's not worthy. He's earned at least that much, maintaining his humanity despite rearing as a child soldier at Hawk's Academy.Female lead Cerise similarly bears up under pressure in the swamp as head of some two dozen family members, aka gangsters-in-training. Cerise overkills the antagonism. William bears her insults with a smile, but I was not amused the umpteenth time she called him an idiot and rebuffed him with extra sauce. Was it necessary? Sometimes I liked their dialogue, but even the choicer moments pale in comparison to On the Edge. Only a \"Lord Leatherpants\" tossed here and there. I missed the good-natured humor, in the external and inner dialogue. Cerise is Rose on PMS.William and Cerise's romance also lacked... how do you say... passion. It was almost Young Adult. While I liked William's point of view, his legitimate admiration for Cerise, I hate to say so, but maybe the novel could have used some Romancelandia crotch-tightening, LMAO. At the least, I think William should have decided he was worthy for a relationship or some touching or some suggestive dialogue -anything that would have suggested interest beyond high school book-holding- earlier than the last quarter. In the end, Moon's romance disappointed me, and the last minute Misunderstanding just baffled me. It came way too late in the game, the last chapter, in fact, and was unnecessary-- the couple had already declared themselves. Also, I would have liked to have seen William go wolf once or twice. Carrying on a subterfuge meant he may as well have been human. (Just human! Pooh! LOL.)On the adventure side, Andrews dazzles, as usual! Her world-building fascinates and horrifies -ew, he has what growing out of what!- her plot twists and turns, and there is enough unique, magic-twisted, that-is-messed-up swamp adventure to satisfy any urban fantasy reader. She even returns with ambiguous villains. I might have liked this better if I had been expecting a fantasy instead of a paranormal romance with all the relationship-y trappings. So, I'm sure many other fans enjoyed this one, but I'll think twice before I pick up the next one."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie", "userReview": "1.) On the Edge \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Buddy Read with Ilona Andrews Addicts (IAA)! I originally wanted to read these books, because while reading Sweep in Peace my friends kept telling me about the crossover of characters from this series. So once I finished On the Edge I was completely in love with Jack and George! But then I was like, \"Where is Gaston and Lark/Sophie?\" Well, in this installment of the series I got to finally learn about them! They both completely won me over, but man did Lark completely pull at my heartstrings. This series is about the Edge, which is where the Weird and the Broken touch. The Weird has magic, and the Broken does not. They are mirrors, or parallel universes, to each other. So essentially, the people that live in the Edge are between worlds.I didn't love William in On the Edge, so I was a little on the fence about this book because I knew it was surrounding him instead of Rose and Declan. I'm not going to lie; the start was a little rough for me. I immediately connected with Cerise, and kept getting annoyed with William for calling her a hobo every other page! I felt such sick satisfaction when he found out what she was actually doing (and how she actually looked). Once I got passed their initial meeting, I ended up loving them together and completely was sold on them being a couple. Cerise has an insanely large family, who is constantly struggling with a feud against a neighboring family. It's a pointless war that's been going on way past their generation, and is filling their lives with constant violence and struggle. After the opposing family tries taking over one of her family's estates, at the same time as her parents mysteriously vanish, something obviously needs to be done about it. Everyone that follows my reviews knows by now that I love me a good strong female lead, and Cerise doesn't disappoint. Not only is she selfless with taking care of Lark, her baby sister, but her whole clan. \u201cThey hold a grudge like it was their family treasure.\u201d A mission falls into William's lap, when a man in the Edge is killing innocent changeling children. William is a wolf-shifter, who had a pretty terrible upbringing, so there probably isn't a mission out there that would hit him closer to home for him. The specific place in the Edge that he has to go is the Mire. The Mire is pretty much where all the criminals from the Weird go that are looking to not ever get caught. Because of a lucky turn of events, Cerise and William's paths cross. All William wants is a family, which is very apparent in On the Edge. So apparent that I was actually a little turned off and confused, but when he instantly connects with Cerise it is much more understandable. I mean, the girl is like the pinnacle of the word \"family\". We end up finding out that Cerise's family, and William's mission, may have more secrets in common than we initially thought. \u201cWhy couldn't she have gotten another Edger or some dimwit from the Broken for a passenger? No, she got Lord Leather Pants here.\u201d My favorite part of this entire book was the epilogue. Don't get me wrong, I loved learning more about the characters that had cameos in Sweep in Peace. I also loved the unconditional love that Cerise and William shared. I loved the banter, the fighting, the sex. I loved it all, but the best part, for me, was when Cerise and Rose became friends in the end. The whole time while reading Cerise's POV I kept thinking how much better it would have been if she had met Rose in the Edge and could have a kick ass girlfriend. So when they finally bonded, over beers and faded blue-jeans, my little heart was so happy! I'm already completely sold on Fate's Edge just in hopes that I get to see glimpses at this amazing girl friendship!

A Long book! 4 Stars this was a great read! I can't classify The Edge Series. It isn't Urban, it isn't Paranormal. It isn't Romance. I could try to classify this book as 'Swampy Magical Fantasy', but I doubt there are other books out there that would fit into this new category. I suppose I could agree with Gordon and say it is Rustic Fantasy. I think it suits this particular story anyway. Ilona and Gordon have written a complex miasma filled with Political Intrigue, Fantastic Magical Creepy Beasts, interesting characters and plots that will leave you scratching your head in wonder and amazement at the creativeness of two humans. Bayou Moon is a book that is so different from any other book or series I have read or heard about. That makes it special. The Edge Series is dark and scary, gross and bloody.\nSome of my favorite things about Bayou Moon:\n1) A wicked kick ass chic as a lead named Cerise. The girl can rock the small flashy sword. Cerise longs for love, safety, and freedom from financial burdens.2) A Bad ass Wolf named William. William longs for family, a place to belong, and the love of a good woman.3) Disgusting and gruesome monsters and villains who have no morals, no dignity and no scuples. 4) Dialogue that is meaningful and sometimes funny. 5) Side characters who have depth and relevance to the story.6) An absorbing world, and colorful world building. Things that bothered me 1) Lengthy descriptions of scenery and sometimes too much time on a scene. But Overall, I immensely enjoyed the world.2) No map of territories. As a reader it was hard to visualize this world on a map. Originally, after reading 'On the Edge', the first book in this new series, I thought the Edge was all encompassing. In this story, we are taken to the Mire, which is inside the Edge. I was confused for a while. There was a lot to take in and try to comprehend. You have the Weird, the Edge and the Broken. Then you have the Lousiana People, the Adrianglians, the Hand and the Mirror. I found myself re-reading passages to try and wrap my head around all the different places, people and worlds within the worlds. ******************************************************************** I would recommend this book to all Fantasy Fans. Urban, Paranormal, Magical etc. It was enjoyable, different, and interesting. I look forward to all other Edge Books.*******************************************************************"}, {"userName": "Orient", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43587353-orient", "userReview": "Uncertainty, Trap, Fantasy, Mystery,Adventure, Betrayal, Love.

I adored the Cerise's and William's relationship. Cerise is so strong, determined and admirable, but also vulnerable. Andrews really skillfuly revealed the character of William, his strenght, loneliness and passion. I liked that William is vulnerable and dedicated too. Along with his absolute loyalty and protective drive, it made me like him. I loved the little visit to meet Declan, Rose, George and Jack in the end of the book, and the epilogue is way better than in the first book.

The world building was incredible. Ilona Andrews (and her husband Gordon) are a very imaginative duo. When they build a world, they fully immerse the reader in that world. Bayou Moon is a world of swamps, mud, strange creatures, eccentric characters, and magic. Bayou Moon takes place two years after On the Edge. For those who have not read these books, The Edge is a place that exists as kind of a buffer zone between our world (The Broken) and the Weird (a magical parallel universe to our world). The Mire is a very swampy part of The Edge and is a place of lawlessness and feuds. It has kind of a trailer park feel to it, a poorer and wilder part of The Edge. This book focuses on William and Cerise. William was introduced in On the Edge and I did not find him a likable character at the time. Cerise is a new character, a member of the large and magical Mars family. William is on a secret mission and meets Cerise on his journey into The Mire. Right away, we experience the Ilona Andrews\u2019 trademark banter complete with sparks flying between William and Cerise, but there did not seem to be the kind of attraction that has been done so well in their other books. I really enjoyed the descriptions of the swamp and the creatures that lived within it. The mode of transport was especially neat, boats pulled by these otter/seal creatures called rolpies. Using a giant eel as a \u201cwatchdog\u201d was also very original. The swamp is a dangerous, oppressive place and there are many other dangerous creatures living in it. Giant sharks, huge alligators, not to mention the feuding families that live in the swamp, all are lethal. I loved Cerise\u2019s family. Every single member of this family had some kind of endearing eccentricity that just made me want to read on. It seemed to me that Cerise was the smartest of the bunch as she did the family bookkeeping. Cerise was also a white flasher \u2013 she was able to control magic and flash white with her sword. I loved how the family constantly tried to pair up Cerise and William. One of my favorite scenes was when Cerise and her assorted female relatives were watching William and commenting on how attractive he was. I didn\u2019t particularly like Cerise. I can\u2019t figure out why I didn\u2019t like her. Just didn\u2019t. I felt the same way about William\u2019s character as well. I did like reading his \u201cwolfie\u201d thoughts but there just didn\u2019t seem to be enough \u201cwolfie times\u201d for William. The villain in this book was very brutal. Spider was just creepy as were his \u201cfused\u201d henchmen. Spider\u2019s specialty, aside from violence, was to fuse humans with other creatures and plant life to create monsters to serve him. Think of it as a kind of \"veggiepunk\" (as opposed to steampunk). I found this book to be a really imaginative read. I can\u2019t wait until Ilona Andrews publishes the next book in this series."}, {"userName": "Anzu The Great Destroyer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2278800-anzu-the-great-destroyer", "userReview": "Ilona Andrews has to be my between my most favorite authors because I\u2019ve yet to read one of her books and rate it under four stars. I absolutely love this woman. No wait, let me rephrase. I absolutely love this team (since Mr. Gordon is helping with the books as well).As you probably know, I am not a Romance chick. I actually can say that I kind of hate the Romance genre. I can count on one hand the total number of Romance books I actually liked. But The Edge, my friends\u2026 this is the way I like my Romance.Now yes, I am aware that The Edge novels are not really Romance novels, but a mix of Romance and Urban Fantasy, the latter being a dominant force. And yes, this is why I love them in the first place. Romance books bore the crap out of me because they have no plot. Most of the time. They are cheesy, most of them are porn. They are shallow. They are idiotic. Meh. But when the Romance element is a small part of the novel I am happy because I don\u2019t have to focus on how much each character wants to get in the other one\u2019s pants. They have more important problems to think about. And then when a romantic moment comes I savor it because it\u2019s like a breath of fresh air on a hot summer day. Yes, I am cheesy. I know.

Right now it hasn\u2019t been fitting my mood, causing me to take \nforever\n to read it. Maybe the labyrinthine twists and turns of the Louisiana Bayou are the perfect setting for the Byzantine-like world that is presented in this one, book #2 of The Edge series. I absolutely loved the first, On the Edge, which was a total surprise. I remember trying to pick up all the intricacies of the Edgers\u2019 world and starting over before I was half-way through with pure joy. (I even repeated it a week later by audiobook.) However, in this one, I was just saying to myself, \u201cCome on, already!\u201d with the world building. I can\u2019t explain why, because I loved the protagonists, tenacious Cerise and socially awkward William, but the first half of this book didn\u2019t grab me, or hook me, or touch me.

Cerise Mar is from The Edge, which lies between the Broken, a non-magic world, and the Weird, where magic rules. Her family is money poor but land rich, and has been in a life-long feud with the Sheerile family. Now Lagar Sheerile has claimed ownership of her grandparents house, and her mother and father has been taken by the Hand, spies who has no problem killing and torturing. They are deadly, so altered with magic that some of them aren\u2019t human anymore. William, is a changeling, who is all alone in the world. He yearns for a family, but knows that he will never have that. Changelings are either killed at birth, or surrendered to the government, where they are taken to Hawk\u2019s Academy, a prison where they are taught to be killers and nothing more. Once William left Hawk\u2019s he joined The Legion, before he was sentenced to death. After being saved by a man intent on using him to kill his best friend, Declan, he has retreated to the Broken, hoping for a semi-normal but alone life. But then he\u2019s called upon The Mirror, the Andriaglian\u2019s Secret Service, who needs him to locate Spider, the Hand\u2019s most deadly spy, and to take away the object he\u2019s looking for. And so Cerise and William\u2019s paths cross, and a truce is agreed upon, to stop the Hand and find Cerise\u2019s parents before it\u2019s too late. I just loved this world that IA has created. It utterly amazes me. The magic, the characters, the world and the humor. All of it is just fantastic. And the writing is just wonderful, and beautiful. \nNight had claimed the Mire. It came on padded feet, soft and cautious, like a swamp cat, with its ears raised and its eyes opened wide.\n Cerise\u2019s family was hilarious and crazy and I loved them. Especially her cousins Richard and Kaldar. I cannot wait for Kaldar\u2019s book. \nThe judge\u2019s massive eyebrows crept up. \u201cKaldar. Are you the one speaking for the plaintiff today?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Honor.\u201d\u201cWell, shit,\u201d Dobe said. \u201cI guess you\u2019re familiar with the law. You hit it over the head, set its house on fire, and got its sister pregnant.\u201d\n And little Lark, Cerise\u2019s sister. Who is so broken, that she believes herself to be a monster. This little girl just broke my heart, and I just wanted to hug her, and adopt her. \nSome women waited for a knight in shining armor. She, apparently, had ended up with a knight in black jeans and leather, who wanted to chase her down and have his evil way with her.\n Cerise is my kind of heroine. Strong, capable and snarky. I just loved how she was no damsel in distress, and seeing her fight with a sword made me fall a little in love with her. And how she kept strong for her family was so admirable, and no matter how dire circumstances were, she didn\u2019t let it get the better of her. \n\u201cIs there anything else you need to tell me?\u201dEvery time I look at you, I have to put a leash on myself. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIf you lied to me, I\u2019ll hurt you,\u201d she promised.He showed her his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019ll try.\u201dShe sighed. \u201cYou worry me, Lord Bill.

William hid a laugh. \u201cYou should be worried, and I am.\u201d He folded the arms of the crossbow and headed toward the boat.\n I have been in love with William since the first book. This broken, lonely man, who craved love and a family. The fact that he loved Cerise\u2019s strength just made me love him even more. It\u2019s not every day that you find a man who can appreciate a strong, independent woman. The romance was damn sexy, and the banter between William and Cerise was wonderful. I must say the Hand was damn scary, and freaked me out with all their weird abilities. And Spider was as evil as you can get. I loved everything about this book. The fascinating world, the fantastic characters, the captivating plot, and the wonderful romance. A must read for EVERYONE, no matter what genre you prefer. You don\u2019t want to miss out on the magic that is IA.Original review 07/03/2014 I loved William in the previous book, and I was so excited to see that this book would be his. William is a changeling soldier, and so very lonely. He has no family, and no-one who really cares about him except his best friend Declan.  Cerise Mar is amazing, a brilliant fighter and responsible for her large family after her parents disappeared.  I loved the bantering between Cerise and William and their romance was wonderful. The Mar family was great, and I loved reading about them.  The villain in this book was very scary, and the plot intense. I had trouble putting this book down.

I don't have a lot to add to what I said last year. I still skipped Spider's scenes, and I've actually taken to skipping most of the sex scenes (it's not this book, it's every book I read - especially if I've read them before). But I love William and Cerise.January 2015 Re-read: I cannot believe I've never written a review for this.But as I sit here and try to think of how to quantify my feels about this book with words... I kind of can understand why I have not.I adored On the Edge. Declan and Rose were fantastic. George and Jack wormed their way into my heart and made me love them. The world - as to be expected from Ilona Andrews - was amazing, fun, and scary. I wasn't sure how I was going to feel getting away from them so completely. Sure, I'd met William in that book and liked him well enough, but still. Fortunately, for me, these authors know how to pull me along in a story.William. What can I say about William? He's such an amazing character. He's been used and abused for the majority of his life, and while he does have some self-pity about it he's mostly just trying to forge his own life. He separated himself from everything that was painful in the past and - when we start the book - he's living on his own terms. He wants, more than anything, family and love. He doesn't think they're for him because he's been abandoned so frequently, but he still yearns for them. That, along with his absolute loyalty and protective drive, made me love him. How he grew to be the man he is - honorable, kind, compassionate - with his upbringing, blows my mind. \"If you let him, he'll love you forever and he won't know how to let go. Make sure you truly want him before you take that plunge.\"If there's one thing you need to know about Ilona Andrews it's that they write kick-ass heroines. Cerise is no exception. She's well trained, determined, loyal, and absolutely willing to be the shield and the sword that her family needs of her. She has the responsibility of her entire large clan depending on her, and even when it's too much she never shrugs it off. Unlike William, Cerise grew up with love. The Mars family may be poor, may be called Rats, but there's genuine care and loyalty between them.Unlike most of Ilona Andrews other books and series this series falls more firmly on the romance side of the genre labels. It still has amazingly strong world-building, and fantastic action plots, but the romance is definitely front and center, with a different couple in each book, and their relationship/courtship being one of the main threads throughout. What's awesome is that you get the best of Urban Fantasy and the best of Romance all rolled into one book.William and Cerise are amazing on their own. I loved them for themselves. But you put them together and they blew my mind. Their interactions are so much fun, and their reactions to each other are priceless. I love that William has no games to play. What he feels is absolute. I really appreciated that Cerise didn't use that against him. She played no games with him either. Everything he thought registered on his face. His wife would have no guesswork. If he was sad, she'd know. If he wanted sex, she'd know. If he wanted another woman, she'd know, too. He wasn't capable of lying, even if he wanted to.Though I'm a big advocate of reading series in order, you don't have to have read On the Edge prior to picking up this book. There's very little crossover, and it mostly come at the end. If you have read it (and it's worth reading!) you'll remember that just outside our world (which is called the Broken - for its lack of magic), there's the Edge, and on the other side of that is the Weird. Why the citizens their call their world the Weird, I'm not quite sure, but they do. In the Edge there's a mix of the magic from the Weird, and the lack of magic from the Broken. Electricity works there, so do curses. If you're lucky you can travel between the realms, but it's going to hurt like hell going through the border. And if you have too much magic - or too little - the crossing could kill you.I like to think of the Weird and the Broken as cosmic balances for each other. Our history, in the Broken, is flipped almost exactly on its head in the Weird. There are parallels, but things are also very, very different. In their counterpart to North America, there are two main Dukedoms that have long been involved in a cold war. Instead of going to war outright - and destroying both of themselves - they throw spies at each other. Adrianglia has the Mirror. The Dukedom of Louisiana has the Hand. While the Mirror prefers their gadgets and magic weapons, the Hand prefers to alter their people. And they come up with some grotesque, but dangerous, alterations. And here's where things get interesting. The Hand has agents in the Mire (a part of the Edge) looking for something, a weapon that will be devastating to the war between Adrianglia and Louisiana. The leader of the Hand's agents is a man that's now called Spider. No one the Mirror has thrown against him has come back alive. No one has gotten close to taking him out, except one man. William. So when the Mirror shows up, dangling that bit of unfinished business in front of William, he can't refuse.He didn't expect to run full-on into an eighty-year feud - at the center of this whole mess - with Cerise standing in the middle of the storm. \"Who's your friend?\"\"His name is William. He's from the Weird. I found him in the swamp and he followed me home.\"\"Did you feed him?\"\"Yes.\"\"There's your mistake. That will do it every time.\"I see, from my notes, that I enjoyed the scenes with Spider (in his POV) the first time I read it, but I have to admit that this time I just wasn't in the mood - I skimmed and skipped the majority of those parts. He's a sociopath. Completely sane, actually, but evil. And Spider believes that he's doing good for his country. I'm reminded of a quote from Shadowfever: \"Evil is bad that believes it's good. While I didn't enjoy these sections as much this time through, it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the novel one bit. \"The world is full of monsters. I chose to become one, so the rest of my country-men can sleep peacefully in their beds, knowing that their families are shielded by the likes of me.\"William, Cerise, her large, crazy family, the action, the suspense, intrigue and magic mystery had me absolutely enamoured - all over again.I loved the little bit of a visit we get with George and Jack near the end of the book, and the epilogue just made me grin and fist-pump. I love that Cerise doesn't lose any of her badass-ness because she's mated. She's just as strong, just as kick-ass. I can't wait to dive into the next book. This is my first re-read of this series, and I'm finding that I don't remember much, so it's a little like reading again for the first time. I love it.\"Fuck easy, Ceri. If you love him, fight for him.

Don't bother trying to wear make-up, if you can get it to stick to your wet face in the first place, it will just come off. Don't bother trying to do your hair- the humidity will re-do it for you within minutes. It gets like this where I live too sometimes - like now. It literally feels like a sauna outside and it's almost midnight. The frogs are so loud that they must be having a rave or something out in the woods behind my house.\ntheir drug of choice is to lick their toad friends... it's kind of creepy....So, the world building in this book is great. You will feel the need for a mint julip and some fried gator while reading it.We get William the Wolf's story in this book. He is a handsome guy with very wolf-like thoughts. I love how he is constantly having to remind himself to think more like a human. He has immediate, doggyish reactions to things and then tries to see it from the human's point-of-view. He decides he wants Cerise, but has no idea on how to achieve getting her to like him. He comes up with a half human/half wolf idea:\nHe'd have to stalk her, he decided. Carefully and patiently. He would bring her flowers, swords, and whatever else she liked, until he was sure when he pounced, she wouldn't want to run away.\nCerise is a tough kickass girl who was raised in the Mire. She has a huge, crazy family that she is responsible for and will do anything to protect. She has a heart of gold, but is also a stone cold killer and William loves that.\nThey swarmed her. She whirled, cutting through them, slicing limbs in half, severing muscle and bone. Blood sprayed, she paused again and the fighters around her fell without a single moan. Four seconds and the deck was empty. Nothing moved.She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.\n\nCerise looks good in red... luckily...The best thing about this book, though, is Cerise's family. They are numerous and crazy. Awesome!!\nGrandma, did you catch Gramps in the moonshine again?Her family has to go to court to try and get back their land, and her cousin, Kaldar, is well known by the local judge.\n\"I guess you're familiar with the law. You hit it over the head, set its house on fire, and got its sister pregnant.\"A huge grin sparked on Kaldar's face. \"Thank you, Your Honor.\" \nI'm not sure that was a compliment...Cerise's family is like the Beverly Hillbillies with scary magic. Tons of fun! It is so worth it to read this book just to experience the Mar family hoedown.There is a lot of fighting and action in the book, but not so much that it gets tedious. The family scenes are hilarious, and so are William and Cerise's interactions. I liked everything about this book."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "Number two in the series and I enjoyed it every bit as much as number one although the main characters have changed. I am not usually a fan of werewolves but this one is very attractive and the girl he wants, Cerise, is a pretty amazing character too. Some great world building, fascinating creatures, an endlessly amazing extended family and a cute love story make this a very readable book. There is also quite a lot of fighting and blood and gore. But that's okay too. My only complaint would be the ending which was much too sudden and easy after all the struggles they had been through. It felt as though the authors met a deadline and just typed The End. Nevertheless I will be putting book three on my kindle asap."}, {"userName": "Milda Page Runner", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18708315-milda-page-runner", "userReview": "Complete opposite to the first book in the series this one is - dark, intense, bloody and brutal. It falls closer to urban fantasy traditional formula starting with the murders and the MC being hired to catch the bad guy. There is a romance and some humour but due to intensity of the main plotline they are pushed into a second plan, fast paced 'edge of the seat' sort of action dominating the story. Gloomy rainy and misty setting of Louisiana swamps filled with dark magic and creepy predators gives it nearly noir atmosphere.It lightens up towards the end but HEA is not without it's cost along the way. Recommend for readers looking for a darker fast paced urban fantasy."}, {"userName": "Robyn", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25037254-robyn", "userReview": "I liked this second book in the series. One thing I appreciate about Andrews' books is that these are women who don't need saving. They legitimately kick ass. (And sometimes the men are the ones that need it, like in this case!) I also love their descriptions of Georgia nature (you can tell they're really grounded in where they live). Finally, I like that they often acknowledge the realities of what it means to be poor - not something you read about in fantasy all that often.

I think one reason may be that the hero was not a blonde, Norse god, good-guy type. Yes, I prefer the damaged, brooding hero, slightly unstable but with a good heart, who deserves a chance at happiness and can also seriously kick butt when needed. What can I say? William made a much more interesting story than Declan, in my opinion.Oh, and Cerise is another strong heroine who can keep up with the butt-kicking and lead an entire clan of Edgers into either food or war as needed. I really liked her, too. I felt much more comfortable with the Edge in this one. I got the hang of the world after the first book, and I decided it's really cool. This one takes place much deeper in the Edge than the previous book, so there are no trips to Walmart (bonus!). At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like a setting entirely in the swamp, but it was so unusual that it ended up setting this book apart from pretty much any I've read. It added a vivid layer to the world-building that enriched the whole story. Although the Romance element was still very strong, the Paranormal / family feud aspects easily held their own, and the people in the world were wonderfully varied. I love it when side characters add flavor instead of being generic. I enjoyed so many of the Mar clan, and the villains were so... gross! This definitely has its share of gore, as I'm coming to expect from the Ilona Andrews team.I admit, I was a bit irritated with the ending. I think it could have been much stronger if it didn't take a Romance-complicating turn that was really not necessary. It felt contrived, as that kind of plot device usually does to me. I had forgotten I was reading a Romance until that point. Oh well. This series still offers some of the best Paranormal Romances I've read - there's much more to them than the Romances. Everything combined to make a rich and layered story, full of swampy, Edgy atmosphere, family humor, magic and dire battles. I thoroughly enjoyed it."}], "description": "The Edge lies between worlds, on the border between the Broken, where people shop at Walmart and magic is a fairytale\u2013and the Weird, where blueblood aristocrats rule, changelings roam, and the strength of your magic can change your destiny\u2026Cerise Mar and her unruly clan are cash poor but land rich, claiming a large swathe of the Mire, the Edge swamplands between the state of Louisiana and the Weird.
