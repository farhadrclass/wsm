Wagamese offers some deeply moving and highly emotional observations, without ever once dripping into mawkishness.There is truth and reconciliation here, in a very real sense. In the past dozen years, that phrase has become so overdone and so hackneyed in our country, that many people tune it out when they hear it. To many, it is only a glib advertisement for dealing with \"that whole native question\" without once giving thought to the real people and the real conditions that shaped the lives of those who seek settlement with how their past was shaped. Wagamese gives us a clean line of sight into what truth and reconciliation really means:There is a song that is Canada. You can hear it in the bush and tree and rock, in the crash of a Pacific surf and the blowing of the breeze across the prairie sky. There are ancient notes in its chorus, voices sprung from M\u00e9tis roots, Ojibway, Cree, Micmac and then French, German, Scottish and English. It's a magnificent cacophony. I have learned that to love this country means to love its people. All of them. When we say \"all my relations\" it's meant in a teaching way, to rekindle community. We are part of the great, grand circle of humanity, and we need each other. It wouldn't be Canada with one voice less.To rekindle community. To rekindle that which was broken, and torn from, the first peoples. He spares no one in this, including himself: what it means to rekindle the remnants of a frozen life: first the harm that was done to him, to his people; then the harm that was done to him by his people; and finally the harm he did to himself because of the burdens he carried. This is a book then, for finding out the real meaning of truth and reconciliation. It is also a book for anyone who is looking for home, for their roots, for their clan or tribe.\"You become invisible when you're homeless.\" He writes of the obvious homelessness of a youth without family, without hope, on the streets of the numerous cities across this country in which he alternately starved, was ignored, was abused, became an abuser of drugs and alcohol. But also implied is the rootlessness of not knowing your origins, of not knowing where you belong, of not having a place to hang your spiritual hat without the connections of ancestors, be they Ojibway, be they French or Irish or Italian. In the end, having that label of who you are makes all the difference in the world -- for labels are both a weapon, and a balm.You learned that labels have weight. You learned to drink so that you wouldn't have to carry those labels or feel them stuck to you like arrows. And in your drunken stumble the shutters on their homes snapped closed because you've become exactly what they expected. When you found your people, you became Ojibway. You became Anishinabe. You became Sturgeon Clan. You became Wagamese again, and in that name was a recognition of being that felt like a balm on the rawness where they'd scraped the Indian away. Ojibway. It resonated in you. It was a label that held the promise of discovery, of homecoming, of reclamation and rejuvenation.This is a book I will cherish and keep close at hand for dipping into often, for grounding myself when I feel the night is too long."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "Stories are meant to heal. That's what my people say, and it's what I believe. Culling these stories has taken me a long way down the healing path from the trauma I carried. This book is a look back at one native life, at the people, the places and the events that have helped me find my way to peace again, to stand in the sunshine with my beautiful partner, looking out over the lake and the land we love and say \u2013 yes.\nIn the introduction to One Native Life, author Richard Wagamese explains that when he and his partner Debra Powell moved to a house on a mountainside lake, the setting \u2013 everything from the morning light to the sounds of wildlife to the sense of community with his neighbours \u2013 provoked strong memories from his tumultuous life, and having been a professional writer for his entire career, he decided to write them down. What follows are sixty-five short vignettes, ranging in length from three to five pages, and while at first I was a bit put off by the jarring format, I soon saw the wisdom in Wagamese's method: this isn't a book to rush through, but rather one to pick up, savour, and set down again for contemplation. With the beautiful prose for which I have long admired Wagamese, and a candid revelation of those events that propelled him from the foster care system to the streets and then on to peace, this book is not just beautiful but important: this is the history of Canada and the history of its relationship with its native population, and through the example of this one native life, in a voice without anger or bitterness, Wagamese invites us all to join in a conversation, as neighbours, over our common back fence.As an example of the format, the story The Country between Us opens with an observation from Wagamese's present:\nThere are times when something as simple as the rain that freckles slate grey water can take me back to it \u2013 that feeling I remember from my boyhood when the ragged line of trees against the sky filled me with a loneliness that had nothing to do with loss. The land sometimes carries an emptiness you feel in you like the breeze.It's not a sad feeling. Rather it's a song I learned by rote in the tramp of my young feet through the rough and tangle of the bush that shaped me. I come to the land the same way still, expectant, awake to the promise of territories beyond the horizon, undiscovered and wild. All those years in cities never took away that feeling of tremendous awe.\nWagamese then tells a brief story about camping with his birth family after he had reconnected with them; about how he experienced true reverence in the presence of unspoiled nature on a canoe trip with his brother in traditional Ojibway territory, and then returned to find the elders watching baseball on a portable television. The story concludes:\nAll Canadians have felt time disrupt them. Everyone has seen the culture they sprang from altered and rearranged into a curious melange of old and new. So the country between us is not strange. We all carry a yearning for simpler, truer times. We all crave a reaffirmation of our place here, to hear the voices of our people singing on the land.\nAnd every vignette is like this: a lovely introduction, a related memory, and a concluding paragraph on the lesson to be learned from it. Reading them quickly makes the collection feel formulaic, but taken more slowly, each is a perfect round berry hanging in a cluster from a mountain ash branch; more satisfying when plucked one by one.Despite the brevity of each story, One Native Life serves as a satisfying memoir, throwing light on the Wagamese novels I've read: explaining his knowledge of baseball and radicalism in A Quality of Light; homelessness and the carnie life in Ragged Company; hockey and the effects of residential schools in Indian Horse; the sorrow of being disconnected from your heritage in Medicine Walk. Wagamese reveals his fascinating life story in a thoughtful order, and I couldn't help but admire him for finding his way to peace in the wake of trauma and prejudice. Consistently concluding with words of quiet wisdom, I repeatedly got the sense that if only all Canadians, of every heritage and circumstance, could take a moment in stillness to really listen as the neighbours speak their truths over the back fence, we'd be the true partners in the national project that would raise us all up."}, {"userName": "Shawn Mooney", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50408211-shawn-mooney", "userReview": "Written in plain but powerful prose and bite-sized chapters, this memoir of an indigenous Canadian writer is one of the most hypnotically calming books I've ever read.

Rounded up from 4 1/2 to 5 since heads above the 3 1/2's I've rounded up to 4.The book is lyrical, deliciously descriptive and very poetic. I wanted to write down many paragraphs in the book and hold them forever in my heart. It is the kind of book you could reread many times. Even just reading a few pages will fill you with a sense of gratitude and wonder as Richard reminds us of all the gifts this planet offers and the simplicity and grandeur of it all. Richard is truly a gifted storyteller who has carefully honed his craft of the written word.The book is a collection of 2-3 page reflections and stories about the author Richard Wagamese - an Ojibway, a Canadian and a human being (Richard's words). I am going to see if this book is available in audio. It would be awesome.....just listening to the words...the emotions....the sounds described in the book, the language itself. I so much wanted to read the book aloud to myself and to someone else and sometimes did.Richard's sharings and observations are moving, evoke emotion and truly inspire. I will be reading another of his books very soon.He speaks about the elders who teach. That is what Richard does in this book. He teaches us with words, with feelings and with a great love of others and the universe. You can feel the silence and stillness within him. As he says and I paraprase - you often learn more in the silence after the speech/book is over. I found myself often rereading sections and just relishing in the sheer pleasure of what I had read. I highly recommend this book to everyone of all ages."}, {"userName": "\u2740 Susan G", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7820199-susan-g", "userReview": "https://ayearofbooksblog.com/2016/12/...\"I have always wanted to write. There isn't a time I can recall when I didn't carry the desire to frame things, order things upon a page, sort them out, make sense of them. But learning to write was a challenge, an ordeal\".As part of a Secret Santa book exchange, I was thrilled to receive a copy of One Native Life by Richard Wagamese. It is a series of vignettes which form a memoir of his life, giving insight into his challenging childhood and life experiences which inspire such beautiful storytelling. The Medicine Walk was my first introduction to Wagamese and is my absolute favourite book of 2016! After finishing this book, I devoured Indian Horse and Ragged Company which also shared difficult stories that give readers a different perspective to consider. All Canadians should read these books to consider the generational impacts of the dreadful residential schools.One Native Life is a transparent account of Wagamese's early life. His birth family had been scarred by residential schools leading to alcoholism, abuse, abandonment and neglect (not to mention a badly shattered shoulder leaving his arm deformed prior to a surgical repair years later). He was placed into foster care and then into an adopted family where he was also abused and left without a connection to his indigenous heritage. Wagamese spoke of how eager he had been to learn yet he was held back, labelled as a \"slow, difficult learner\" without \"much hope for the future\". He was learning mostly by memorizing and it was not until Grade 3 when a caring teacher asked him to write on the board that it she realized that he was not a slow learner but vision problems and needed glasses. That teacher helped him relearn his letters and he graduated with straight A's that year!Life at home and at school was not easy. He sought refuge in the library, reading, listening to music, learning about art and discovering a new world.\"Libraries have always been my refuge. As a kid I met Peter Pan there, Curious George, the Bobbsey twins and the great Red Rider. It was stunning to discover that they'd let me take those characters home. I loved the smell of libraries, too a combination of dust and leather and the dry rub of paper mixed with paint and wood and people.The library showed me the mysteries of the world. There was always something that I'd never heard of or imagined, and books and stories where I could learn about it. I read wide-eyed, tracing the tricky words with a finger I could sound them out and discern a fragment of meaning. The library was like an enchanted forest. I explored every inch of the stacks, fascinated by the witches and goblins, fairies and trolls, great wars and inventions I encountered there.\"It was not only the library that sustained him but his writing: \"My life became the walk to school and back. Then it was four hours in my room each night to study. Except that I didn't study. I wrote. I wrote stories and plays and poems. about the kind of life I imagined every other kid was having, a life that wasn't restricted to the cloister of a small room. My stories were filled with hopes, dreams, happy endings and skies. And I never showed them to anybody\".At the age of 15 years, Wagamese ran away. He hitchhiked all the way to Florida before being returned home by police. He ran away again, spent time living on the streets and even worked at a carnival (and yes, helping to put the Ferris Wheel together as described in Ragged Company). These experiences are repeated in his books and I loved gaining insight into the stories he told including the time when he was given a traditional name: \"He called me Mushkotay Beezheekee Anakwat. It means 'Buffalo Cloud'. It's a storyteller's name. he said and he told me that my role in this reality was to be just that: a teller of stories, a communicator, a keeper of the great oral tradition of my people.\"Despite abuse, abandonment and a very difficult childhood devoid of his culture and heritage, his memoir describes his feelings of peace and being a part of the landscape where he lives as an Ojibwe man. He appreciates the trees and the wildlife as he describes the mountain and lake view outside his window. He has reconnected with his birth family, learned his Ojibway language and appreciates the teachings and rituals like smudging. I have learned from each book that I have read and look forward to reading more. Richard Wagamaese has a way of quietly telling stories with lessons of understanding, acceptance and reconsidering judgment. His books are amazing and his name should be synonymous with high school curriculums. I am thankful for his writing, for his bravery and for sharing bits of his own story with readers. I am not sure if he participates in author events but if he comes to Southern Ontario, I will strive to be first in line to meet him!As I visit the library, I will think of the difference that words, stories and books made for this boy as he struggled at home and school. As I search for books to restock my Little Free Library, I will be on the look out for more books by Richard Wagamese as I want all my friends, my neighbours, my community to learn through his stories. I loved reading the memoir but if I can suggest one book to read this year, it will be The Medicine Walk!\"I learned how to live through adversity in the library. I learned how words and music can empower you, show you the world in a sharper, clearer, more forgiving way. I became a writer because of what I found in libraries and If oudh the song that still reverberates in my chest. I'm a better man, a better human being and a better Indian because of the freedom in words and music.\""}, {"userName": "Sandy ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10715774-sandy", "userReview": "This is one of those rare stories which moves me so deeply that I have no words to describe the experience."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17928588-rebecca", "userReview": "Wagamese's vignettes are like perfect precious little berries, quivering ripely, ready to be plucked and eaten whole.

A friend wrote a very warm review for this book and that motivated me to read it. And I am glad that I did. Richard Wagamese was born to residential school survivors who had lost everything they could call their own, including their identity, way of living and confidence. In that they had also lost the basic instinct for caring for their own kids. So, eventually, their two kids were taken away from them. Richard's childhood was spent in foster homes for several years before he was adopted by a white family He ran away from home without completing his school and with little formal education and with the skin color he had, life was tough (I wouldn't use any fancy adjectives, because no words can do justice to the hardships he faced, not just physically but emotionally and very deeply).Later when is discovered by his brother, he finds his roots. He makes peace with his family. He is a keen learner, very well read and person who keeps trying to explore and find meanings in everything, thus ends up being a very positive person.The book started off slowly and I initially thought that the narrator was holding back something and was trying to stay in control to make sure he was not cynical. But eventually he opened up and still without losing control, opened up his heart. His criticism was gentle, non-dramatic and reflective.... that's what touched me the most."}, {"userName": "Dsinglet", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4518841-dsinglet", "userReview": "Richard writes a soulful account of what it is like to face the world when your heritage has been lost.

I was expecting more of a typical memoir but I think he was brilliant in how he wrote in segments containing life lessons, spiritual enlightenment and bits and pieces of his life history. I kept waiting to hear the story of how he ended up in foster care and it finally came but not as I expected. I won't tell you anymore than that because I feel that he made creative choices that brings the reader to an understanding of who the author is. I wavered towards five stars but I only reserve that for the very best of the best but it sure was close. This is a man who I can say I admire deeply and he is far wiser than his years. Here is a quote that resounded in me: \"We heal. Indian and non, we heal. But we must risk being vulnerable to get to the glistening bone of truth- that we are responsible for our own healing.

Being a youngin\u2019, I hope to be able to reflect back on my life at Wagamese\u2019s age with such vivacity and abundance. I put weight in my usage of the word \u2018abundance\u2019 - what hasn\u2019t Wagamese done? In fear of not doing the man justice, I won\u2019t try and list his lifetime achievements to inspire awe for the sake of my review (hey, that\u2019s why you should read the book). What I will mention is how he\u2019s ate lemon meringue pie with Muhammad Ali whilst homelessly nomading at age seventeen - I think this adequately shows that if anyone has thoroughly rode the highway of life, it\u2019d be Wagamese (goshdang-lemon-meringue-pie-people)!Wagamese is everything I hope to be. I like his story, but I think I like his 'soul' or \u2018legacy\u2019, even more. Considering his circumstances growing up, the quality of his writing is absolutely remarkable, forming a true testament to human determination. Wagamese was given nothing, but ended up with so much due to his own perseverance to do so. I relish his words. You can tell he\u2019s spent a lot of time in his head, and I admire that. The abstract ideas he brings to paper continued to inspire me as I read onwards, and I found the ideas that spouted from his head endlessly thought-provoking. Each three page essay would reveal another facet of his life, surprising you once again with the sheer amount of mini-adventures Wagamese lived.In all honesty, I enjoyed the first-half of \u201cOne Native Life\u201d more than I did the second. I don\u2019t think that says anything about the consistent quality of the novel, but rather who I am, as a reader. As a white seventeen-year-old, I found the first half to be much more relatable, as it focused on Wagamese\u2019s adolescence and roots, where the second half focused more on Wagamese as an Ojibway. While I really liked the book as a whole, I think the beauty in the metaphors laced throughout Wagamese\u2019s writing pulled me through the parts which I felt less connected to in topic matter.

I would have given it 5 starts, but two things nagged at me while I read it. 1. the story is not told chronologically, and I had to write myself a time line to figure out when certain things occurred, and if they were before or after other things had occurred. 2.

The internet, particularly social media have separated us more and more from nature each day. Like Thoreau before him, the author attempts to become one with the tranquility of nature. He begins with a simple fishing trip at age six with his first foster father, a kind man named Joe. I am from the same generation and can remember Sunday night TV with Disney, Ed Sullivan and Bonanza. It is amazing what we share, regardless our differences. I am a white American and Wagamese is a Obijway Canadian. As an Indian, he was a stranger in a strange land. As a boy, he raised the Maple leaf flag on a national holiday. One school teacher who cared, changed his life forever when it was discovered that his eyesight was poor and he was given eyeglasses. At 10 he was given a radio and he hears Mahalia Jackson and Billie Holiday for the first time and it made him cry; me too, but many years later. At 13, he rode a horse for the first time. The animal had been abused and the brief story is beautiful. Muhammed Ali became a hero in the 1960s and I was struck by our American influences from music, to television, to sports on Canadian culture. Oh well, we did get Neil Young, William Shatner and Bobby Orr from the Great North. At fifteen, he ran away to Miami but was shortly returned to Canada where he was a homeless substance abuser. He said that the rain healed him, as Mother Earth cries down a blessing; what a perfect expression. While still young, he discovered James Joyce and Finnegan\u2019s Wake made him realize that he needed to become a writer. He was vagabond, taking the road less traveled, something I have never had the courage to do. He lied about his education to get his first writing job at a newspaper covering Indian affairs. At the same time he rejoined his native family to learn the old ways. The simplest things, such as learning to bake bread with his mother, are captivating. The greatest lesson is that we are all connected; again; a simple message, but nevertheless, profound. Wagamese became a successful journalist who questioned Prime Minister Trudeau at a press conference. He was also taught by his elders to become one with nature by keeping quiet and listening to the trees. He met Johnny Cash, who explained the importance of family. The great balladeer believed that television was most responsible for the lack of communication in today\u2019s world. I agree, and we can now add the internet to that statement. Facebook is the beginning of the end. Wagamese finishes the book by describing the terrible physical and emotional abuse from both his biological and foster families. In the end he forgave them.

We certainly lost a treasure when we lost Richard Wagamese."}, {"userName": "Karl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66725853-karl", "userReview": "I like Richard Wagemese's books because his writing is so beautiful, powerful and poetic. This book is a collection of short stories; more a collection of meditations reflecting on his identity, the music he loved, friendships, many hardships, community and most of all his love for nature. Every story ends in a soulful life lesson one can learn from. I give this beautiful collection of his journey through life 4.5 stars.It is sad, that he is no longer with us."}, {"userName": "Pat Carter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50098872-pat-carter", "userReview": "So sorry you will not be writing anymore Richard. Your words move me deeply and I am so happy to read them. Thank you for working through the pain of your troubled life and becoming a writer.

Richard Wagamese is probably the best writer I've discovered to date, and him being Canadian makes him even better. His essays are all extremely well written"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67681253-kim", "userReview": "Takes you on an amazing journey.

In the crisp mountain air Wagamese felt a peace he\u2019d seldom known before. Abused and abandoned as a kid, he\u2019d grown up feeling there was nowhere he belonged. For years, only alcohol and moves from town to town seemed to ease the pain.In \nOne Native Life\n, Wagamese looks back down the road he has travelled in reclaiming his identity and talks about the things he has learned as a human being, a man and an Ojibway in his fifty-two years. Whether he\u2019s writing about playing baseball, running away with the circus, attending a sacred bundle ceremony or meeting Pierre Trudeau, he tells these stories in a healing spirit. Through them, Wagamese celebrates the learning journey his life has been.Free of rhetoric and anger despite the horrors he has faced, Wagamese\u2019s prose resonates with a peace that has come from acceptance. Acceptance is an Aboriginal principle, and he has come to see that we are all neighbours here. \nOne Native Life\n is his tribute to the people, the places and the events that have allowed him to stand in the sunshine and celebrate being alive.", "title": "One Native Life", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4861295-one-native-life", "average": 4.25, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328759750l/4861295.jpg", "reviews": 79, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/321537.Richard_Wagamese", "name": "Richard Wagamese"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Cultural", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4861295-one-native-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19368687-one-native-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6321805-one-native-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11994903-indian-horse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050139-medicine-walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/590563.Ragged_Company", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/590560.Keeper_n_Me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31374734-embers"]}
