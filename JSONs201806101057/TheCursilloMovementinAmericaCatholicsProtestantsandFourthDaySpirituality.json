The Cursillo movement is one of Roman Catholicism\u2019s often unrecognized gifts to all of Christianity. Carefully weaving her own experience and the results of interviews with others into the story, the author has provided an exceptional depth of understanding of the Cursillo method of presentation. It is time for the world to know more about this inspiring movement and this book will set the standard for information about it."}], "description": "The internationally growing Cursillo movement, or \"short course in Christianity,\" founded in 1944 by Spanish Catholic lay practitioners, has become popular among American Catholics and Protestants alike. This lay-led weekend experience helps participants recommit to and live their faith. Emphasizing how American Christians have privileged the individual religious experience and downplayed denominational and theological differences in favor of a common identity as renewed people of faith, Kristy Nabhan-Warren focuses on cursillistas--those who have completed a Cursillo weekend--to show how their experiences are a touchstone for understanding these trends in post-1960s American Christianity. Drawing on extensive ethnographic fieldwork as well as historical research, Nabhan-Warren shows the importance of Latino Catholics in the spread of the Cursillo movement. Cursillistas' stories, she argues, guide us toward a new understanding of contemporary Christian identities, inside and outside U.S. borders, and of the importance of globalizing American religious boundaries.", "title": "The Cursillo Movement in America: Catholics, Protestants, and Fourth-Day Spirituality", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30336906-the-cursillo-movement-in-america", "average": 4.67, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1464872931l/30336906.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/868021.Kristy_Nabhan_Warren", "name": "Kristy Nabhan-Warren"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30336906-the-cursillo-movement-in-america", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16236541-the-cursillo-movement-in-america", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1906598.The_Virgin_of_El_Barrio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19184697-cursillo-movement-in-america", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24243007-the-virgin-of-el-barrio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12342162-the-virgin-of-el-barrio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/749863.In_Time_of_Plague"]}
