Just.... soooo sloooowwww.Let's be honest, I actually liked Divergent for what it was - a fast-paced, exciting YA adventure that demanded very little of me. Sure, a lot of the world made absolutely no sense, and I still find that whole \"I'm Dauntless so I jump off moving trains\" thing so ridiculously laughable, but I found it really entertaining. In this book, though, I spent the majority of it wondering where the actual plot was.It's set in space, and I've heard other reviewers talking positively about how it doesn't feel like it's in space, so maybe that will also seem like a positive for you, but I felt like this story could have been set literally anywhere. The world-building was lacking and the space aspect left undeveloped. Why even bother setting it in space if you're not going to make the most of that? Though I guess there's a definite possibility that the second book will reveal that the characters have actually been in Brooklyn all along, tripping on acid. So, there's that.The story is set on a distant planet where people develop unique powers known as currentgifts, bestowed by a magical current that runs through the galaxy. Most people find their gifts useful, but to some people - like Akos and Cyra - the gifts can be a burden, and a means by which others can use them for their own gains. Cyra's violent and evil brother is the ruler of the Shotet and he uses Cyra's power - the power to deliver intense pain - to further his plans and torture his enemies. Akos, on the other hand, is one of the gentle Thuvhe people. Carve the Mark opens with Shotet soldiers murdering Akos's father and capturing him and his younger brother. What happens next is a very long bit of filler about Akos's time in the Shotet soldier camp, honing his fighting skills and chatting with Cyra about their countries, their powers, or just their favourite colours. I was more than halfway through and wondering when something was going to happen.It wasn't compelling enough. The characters themselves were not interesting enough. If I wasn't wary of the backlash I would get from writing a DNF review, I would have put it aside. The action occasionally picks up but it's not the start of a change of pace; it quickly dies down again. I felt like something happened once every hundred pages.And it's not so easy to mask the simplicity, the lack of creativity, in Roth's latest work. Divergent had just enough quirks to make it stand out against the odds - the use of factions an exciting reminder of Hogwarts' houses for old Potterheads, and a new personality quiz for younger readers. Even those feeling underwhelmed were quick to take a faction quiz to see where they fell (Candor - thanks for asking!). What does Carve the Mark have to make it stand out? I honestly don't have an answer.The world is very simplistic. The Xmen-like powers are nothing we haven't seen before hundreds of times. The politics are uninteresting and the villain is mindlessly evil without any depth or development. I said in a status update that there had been some confusion over the physical descriptions of the characters - that the violent savages are actually described as \"so pale he looked almost like a corpse\" and the pacifist Thuvhe people have \"light brown skin\" and \"dense, curly hair\" - but the reality is only marginally better than the rumours. Having a violently savage race vs. a gentle race without it being adequately addressed is arguably always problematic; it arguably always has troubling real-world connotations. And, even if you disagree with that assessment, at best it's just plain lazy.A hard slog and utterly forgettable.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "It's release day, so I can finally talk about my dislike for this book! It's been a few months since I read it, so my feelings (and outrage) are no longer super fresh, but I'll do my best.I found this book to be SOOO boring and difficult to read, what with the ridiculous character names and dull plot. I had tons of issues with the plot and pacing when I was reading the book, and I really had to force myself to pick it up. The characters were also completely one dimensional and a bore to read about, so really I couldn't find anything to like about the book.With those issues on top of all of the problematic aspects of the story that tons of people have brought up, I have no issues with giving this book 1 star."}, {"userName": "thebookbitch", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15026294-thebookbitch", "userReview": "Let's talk about the elephant in the room: Sponsered reviews from booktubers who were paid to give a positive review and are completely ignoring the Racist Bullshit in this book.

Which is weird in itself because there's also more Booktubers who signed a contract and gave it that same rating. My issue is that they're happy enough to not talk about the Racism in the book because they'd rather get paid instead of being honest. You can't trust these people because they honestly don't care how Racism affects POC. If they did then they'd have talked about it in their reviews. Did they? Nope. Jesse added on an edit saying he didn't see the racism which I'm calling bullshit on. He's trying to make himself look better. Honestly?

DON'T YELL AT ME!i am someone who liked the divergent trilogy. i even sort of liked those four stories: Four: A Divergent Story Collection. but i am SO SO pleased that roth has diverged (ho-HO!) from that path and gone off in a whole new direction with this book (which is apparently the first part of a duology). i do love an author with more than one idea in their head.in a lot of ways, this book is like sagait's got that same romeo and juliet in spaaaaaaace thing going on, where two people on opposite sides of a long and deeply-rooted cultural animosity develop special feelings for each other after one of them is basically the prisoner of the other. \nno wings, no horns, and no teevee-headed people, but the two crazy kids in this book do have some unusual abilities in the form of currentgifts.currentgifts. currentgifts.currentgifts.currentgifts.i still think this is a dumb word, but it's a little less dumb than i expected going into it. \"current\" does not mean a \"now\" gift, which is how i interpreted it from the synopsis, but rather to a gift from a magical current that runs through the galaxy, doling out special abilities to people. some of these abilities are useful, and some are more like burdens than gifts. think x-men. in spaaaaaaaace.i am not usually a fan of space-based novels, and i'm even less enthusiastic about the romantic parts of books, especially in YA. however, i most certainly enjoyed this book. the fact that it is set in space is easy to forget, which sounds like a criticism, but worked out well for me. it's otherworldly, but it's not full of people floating about in spacesuits or going through wormholes or making me feel inadequate in my understanding of, you know, science. the romance is what it is - it's certainly handled better than the romance in other books i have read (including divergent, now that i think about it). it unfolds slowly, it isn't too sappy, and it is grounded in circumstances that seem likely to inspire feelings of \"you and me against the world;\" where two characters who are treated as \"other\" by most people cleave to each other in their otherness and feelings develop in a way that makes sense. although maybe not to them:\"You make no sense to me,\" she said.and happily - cyra is not tris recast in spaaaaaaaace.there are the superficial physical differences - cyra has darker skin, is much taller and \u2026 sturdier than tris, and by the end of the book, something happens that alters her appearance in a way that i personally think is SO FREAKING COOL, and also ghastly. but more importantly, her personality is not just warming up the tris leftovers. they are both proactive and badass with the fighting skills without getting too sentimental when violence needs doing, but cyra has had a much harder path dealt to her than tris, and it has toughened her worldview, giving her more depth and darkness than tris ever had. Pity, I knew, was just disrespect wrapped in kindness.i will confess, it took me some time to get into this one. it may have been my headspace at the time of reading, or it may truly have been a slow starter. divergent grabbed me from the get-go, and i had expected this would be a typically fast YA read for me, but i didn't start really digging it until i was about a third of the way through. some of the drag of it is indeed the names and sillywords, and some of it just doesn't make sense, but a lot of the divergent world didn't make a lick of sense, and it didn't stop it from being entertaining. if books had to make sense, christianity never would have caught on.oh, and the title?-\"Carve the mark,\" I said, my throat tight.and-\"Carve the mark,\" he said. He was so hoarse the words almost didn't come out.what does it mean? why does it make throats tight and words hoarse? blur blur blur - you'll have to wait for that.***********************************************i'm a little surprised by some of the negative reviews, 'cuz i liked it. are my critical faculties rusty? i'll review it soon and you can tell me i'm wrong. that's how this \"goodreads\" thing works, right? ***********************************************OOH, i got my hands on an ARC! now i can enjoy many silly words and names and i hope it's fun!i will dive in SOON!***********************************************i can't even make it through that synopsis without 1) getting bored and 2) activating my \"fantasy genre silly-name\" shield, but as one of the few people who did like the way Allegiant ended (or at least didn't have a problem with the thing most people hated it for), i gotta say i'm looking forward to this. bring it on, silly names and all!"}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/774907-meg", "userReview": "So, I should preface this with a few key points. I work for a bookstore and received an ARC of this book through my job. All opinions are my own. This review is not an attack on the author, the publisher, or anyone else. I am also white, and I am aware this affects my\u00a0position to call something out as racist. I find that it's helpful to raise awareness of problematic representation in the media we consume.In regards to advance copies being sent out to reviewers, I've noticed in a lot of Goodreads reviews that the bloggers state either at the beginning or the end of their review that HarperTeen (HT from here on out)\u00a0\nsponsored\n these reviews. Further research led me to discovering that HT\u00a0paid this set of bloggers to review\u00a0Carve the Mark. This behavior from a publisher is unsettling. Generally speaking, if one is going to be paid for reviewing something, one will not review the thing unfavorably (and if one reviews unfavorably, that reviewer runs the risk of tarnishing the relationship with said publisher). This behavior by the publisher is akin to self-published authors paying readers to post positive reviews of the work in order to boost sales. That's what I feel like HT is doing. Perhaps HT was aware of the problematic material in the book and decided to garner a set of positive reviews to boost sales before the book's official release. I feel as if that money could have been better used to assist Roth in adjusting some of the problematic ideas presented in the book.I stopped reading at page 66. I was simultaneously bored and unsettled by the book and set it aside. This being said, I do not know how the book ends or develops, and I honestly don't care. Here are the main things I found problematic within those first 66 pages:1. The Thuve and the Shotet. The Thuve are presented as a lighter skinned race who are passive. Akos, one of the main characters, views the Shotet as a brutal and fierce\u00a0race of people (the Shotet killed Akos's grandmother). The first time the readers are introduced to the Shotet, the Shotet arrive to Akos's family farm and brutally murder his father.2. The Shotet language is described as harsh and gutteral by Akos compared to his own softer sounding language (who discovers he has the ability to speak other languages without prior conscious knowledge of them). This view of languages is similar to the comparisons of the \"music\" of Romance (white) languages (French, Italian, Spanish) to the \"harsh, guttural\" (black) languages of the African continent.3. While the Shotet are described has having varying tones of skin, Cyra's mother is described as having hair curly enough for fingers to be trapped in the curls while Cyra's is not as curly as that. Um. Okay.4. Cyra's brother Ryz forcibly trades one of his memories for one of Cyra's. Cyra obviously struggles against it and can't fight it, and you know what? That's rape. Forcing someone to take something mentally (and inevitably physically) is an act of rape. Cyra was raped by her own brother. As a result of that rape, Cyra's power manifests itself as pain. Literally. Pain. By page 66, Cyra cannot touch other people without feeling pain, and other people cannot touch her without feeling pain.5. Later, Cyra's mother asks the doctor \"You're saying this gift is my daughter's fault? That she wants to be this way?\" And the doctor (male) says, \"Cyra, the gift comes from you. If you change, the gift will, too.\" So a man is telling a woman that her rape and her pain from that rape is her own fault and that she can change it at will. Yep. That's a blatant reinforcement of rape culture.6. The religion of the Shotet draws heavily from Islamic ideology. Some of the religious leaders are called clerics, and some of the practices reinforce the negative views the West has on Muslim culture. We need to move past these harmful stereotypes.7. While I enjoyed the Divergent trilogy well enough for what it is (even if it's a blatant knockoff of The Hunger Games and Harry Potter, it is also somewhat original in its ending),\u00a0Carve the Mark is a lazy reimagining of the Star Wars and X-Men universes. It tries to be unique and diverse, but\u00a0the glaring insensitivity within the first sixty pages result in its failing.I was excited for this because there aren't too many science fiction novels lately for the YA audience. However, the problems in the novel fail its readers by relying on outdated, racist tropes that should be a thing of the past in 2017. Science fiction is about creating new worlds, exploring new ideas, and finding some kernel of society to examine. Carve the Mark does none of this. Instead of drawing on redundant, harmful tropes, science fiction should offer the author and the readers the ability to create something new, to flip tropes and reinvent them.\u00a0It seems as if the\u00a0editors failed to notice or didn't care, knowing that they'd have a cash-grab with the popular name attached; or it seems as if Roth is privileged enough to be unaware of the damage she has caused with these themes. Maybe it's a combination of both.After the roller coaster of the last several years with the Black Lives Matter movement, the systematic oppression of Muslims, and the discussions I have had and read, I'm finding myself more and more sensitive to the plights of those who are oppressed. I want to give those people a voice rather than reinforce harmful views. Instead of purchasing or reading this, I recommend finding, like many others have suggested, an own voices/diverse work. My personal recommendation\u00a0is N.K. Jemisin's\u00a0The Fifth Season."}, {"userName": "Emer ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4629647-emer", "userReview": "Oh dear!! Where do I start?????Racial stereotyping and cultural misappropriations.Unflagged trigger warnings.And a romanticised depiction of chronic pain (something that is very personal to me).But let's begin with the writing. Wow talk about dull! The first half of this book was so incredibly tedious. The pace, the plotting, the world building (what world building?!?!)... It just dragged. It felt uninspired, insipid, unimaginative, take your pick! Was this book set in space??? It didn't feel like that to me. One of the things that I really didn't like with regards to the writing was the format of switching points of view. It just did not work because it was so poorly executed. It seemed much too haphazard and really hindered the flow of the narrative. So the basic set up is there are two races of people sharing some planet. They hate each other because *reasons* and hatred & drama ensue. Okay. Controversy number one: Racist undertones Many people have been incredibly offended by the depiction of the races in this book saying that it reinforces negative stereotypes within our society. There's a seemingly more civilised race versus a more savage one. Personally I found that there was enough nuance with regard to the diversity of the descriptions of the physical appearances of the two races, but, I think this may have been due to my prior knowledge of this controversy because I was actively reading looking for the differences. If you step back from the book, the overall impression of the two races is not so clear. And there were also worrying descriptors used to ascribe differences between characters, e.g. a reference to curly hair tight enough to capture a finger which is reminiscent of the pencil test used during apartheid times in South Africa to ascertain skin colour. An inadvertent unconscious similarity??? At any rate, I think that conceptually this was a bad idea. Because division of race, even in a fantastical setting, is going to cause problems within our own reality. It is going to offend. And surely that isn't the way forward? I also found a lot of ethnic stereotyping going on in this book. Parts of various cultures being borrowed in a less than savoury manner. Basically at times I felt the book was not carefully researched and therefore did not provide a well thought out and sensitively structured system of beliefs for the people in the story. Trigger Warning Self Harm At this point I would like to draw your attention to some ritualistic behaviours the Shotet people do regarding marking their bodies. In particular during chapter 13 there is a very detailed description of something that could be incredibly triggering to anyone who has issues regarding self-harm. While I personally am okay with the theory behind this behaviour I strongly feel that there should be a warning on the back cover of this book with regards to this behaviour. When are authors and publishers going to take some responsibility for the possible detrimental effects of the content of their published works??? Back to the story:The three main characters in this book are:Cyra, a Shotet girl who experiences chronic pain. Her power hungry, villainous brother Ryzek.And then there is Akos, a Thuvhesit boy fated to serve his Shotet enemy. Let's start with Akos.... I've pretty much nothing to say about him. He was about as interesting as a piece of cardboard. Zero personality. One dimensional. Boring...move on!!!Ryzek, the big bad. Likes to rape minds and steal memories. He could have been a quite chilling character but his portrayal descended into pantomime theatrics and a sensitive subject such as forcibly taking what you want and thereby violation of another person was very badly handled. Next controversy: Rape CultureSo Ryzek rapes Cyra's mind thus causing the early onset of her 'currentgift' which leaves her experiencing chronic pain for which she is ultimately told is her fault because she feels she deserves this pain... That bother anyone else??? Reinforce the idea of victim shaming/blaming???And finally, there is Cyra. She's an interesting character. It's a bold move to attempt to write a character suffering from chronic pain... But was it a move that paid off??? Well with regards to the storyline yes!With regards to upsetting and offending sufferers of chronic pain then it's a big no. Chronic pain controversySo here's a little information about me. Many of my Goodreads friends will know that from time to time I have mentioned that I suffer from multiple chronic illnesses. (Yes multiple.) And one of those illnesses in particular causes great physical pain. It causes more pain than I could ever possibly explain to you. My chronic pain took hold of my life when I was still a child almost 25 years ago. So I think that living with chronic pain for the best part of a quarter of a century qualifies me to discuss it. My first problem with Cyra's chronic pain is the terminology used. It is frequently described as a 'currentgift'. In the glossary a currentgift is explained as follows: thought to be a result of the current flowing through a person, currentgifts are abilities, unique to each person, that develop during puberty. They are not always benevolent.Isn't that last line about this currentgift not always being benevolent great??? As if it somehow excuses you from the offensive terminology of calling the suffering of the main character a 'gift'.Here's a tip for you. Do not ever call chronic pain a gift. Even if it's in a slightly made-up word that you feel the need to explain in the back of your book. What really annoyed me in this instance is how Cyra referred to her pain as a gift. I could accept anyone else in the book referring to it as such and put it down to their ignorance and then possibly have Cyra show why it should not be called such a thing... But she FREQUENTLY called it a gift without any hint of irony, derision or sense of injustice!!! Only once did she disagree, but then, instead of referring to the pain in some other manner, she continued on with this gift terminology. My pain is not, and will never be a gift. I will always experience pain. There is no out. And I am incredibly offended by even remotely suggesting that it could possibly be construed as a gift. Where is my gift receipt please because I'm sending this unwanted gift back!!! Also, my chronic pain is not an ability. An ability???? I don't do magic tricks with it. Unless you want to see how easily I can swallow large painkillers with barely a mouthful of water so I don't vomit!!!!! Okay. I get where the idea of this character is coming from. And there are aspects to the descriptions surrounding Cyra's pain that I really liked.The pain was just part of life now. Simple tasks took twice as long because I had to pause for breathGreat stuff! The normality of everyday living changes completely when you live with chronic pain. You don't have an off switch from it, you have different levels of intensity and somehow you get through a day. And everything takes so very long. Even something as simple as getting out of bed in the morning can take hours. If anyone is interested in understanding more about the life of someone with a chronic illness I would love to direct you to \"The Spoon Theory\". It's a very simplistic but beautiful way of expressing what daily life can be like for chronic illness and pain sufferers. I would encourage anyone to read up on it so you can understand what normality is for those people like me who live under the radar with our invisible diseases. You can read all about it HERE.So here's another problem with the portrayal of chronic pain in the book. It may be stated once or twice that simple tasks take longer etc but I saw no extended periods of fatigue as a result. Cyra was frequently able to fight in a gym type environment... Really??? Like ALL of the time????? Trust me. There are days that no matter how much you try to push through the pain you can't. You just can't. There is insufferable and unending fatigue. Also, if Cyra was truly in as much pain as she was, she would absolutely have been an insomniac as was stated in the book (case in point I'm writing this review at 4am) but she also would have, at times, passed out from the pain. However, there was one lovely quote I liked that I could very much identify with: That he couldn't feel pain also meant he didn't know about the grey space just beneath consciousness that made it more bearable. I love that grey space. I frequently stay hours in that grey space and don't know where my day has disappeared to all of a sudden. So I needed more moments like this. More explanations to ground Cyra's pain in reality. Pain so often should have consumed her body so much that she would have laid there motionless until unconscious. You often cannot take the pain and that needs to be shown more. It goes to this whole romanticised notion of pain. How suffering is some great beauty. That brings me to chapter 25 (mild spoiler ahead) In this chapter Cyra comes to the conclusion that ultimately the gift is the strength the curse has given me... I can bear it. I can bear pain. I can bear anything.This is insulting and wrong on so many levels. I know that ideologically this is a lovely thought. It goes to the idea that being someone living with pain and fighting through to live another day is admirable. Look at how stoic she is, so brave, so strong.... So spare me your melodrama!!! That is an idea for people who don't live with daily pain. It is there, to comfort them. To justify why some people live lives of pain and others don't. It goes to the notion that pain is a burden which is only given to those who are strong enough to carry it. Not true. Pain is indiscriminate. Pain corrupts. Pain infiltrates your every fibre of person. It changes you. You don't become strong you become institutionalised to it. You fall back on survival mechanisms. Don't glorify those mechanisms as some sort of admirable strength. I don't want to bear \"anything\" thanks. The pain is quite enough. It also alludes to a dangerous concept that as pain sufferers we somehow have this skill or ability to take more and more and more. As if we should never feel that the pain is too much??? Trust me, with chronic pain the pain is MUCH too much, and this concept that Cyra thinks that her ability to bear incalculable amounts of pain makes her somehow strong is insulting. It is okay to not be able to bear unending pain every day. It is okay to feel like it is too much. It is okay to need help. It is okay to not have to suffer in silence. It is okay to not have to be martyred by pain. I would also like to have seen a greater emotional impact on Cyra of what it is like to live with pain for so long. I too was a child when pain took hold. I will never forget that first day of experiencing pain. What it was like ripping through my little body. So where was the hatred? The bitterness?? The why me??? The only self loathing we had on Cyra's part was because of how she inflicted her pain on others and her guilt over that. (Btw, also offensive. I would never wish my pain on another soul so to say that that is something a chronic pain sufferer would do... Yeah... Not impressed!) But I would have much preferred this loathing to be based on the manifestation of her pain and not some outside event. I haven't even touched on the idea that Cyra's love interest in this story lessens her pain which just adds this book to the myriad of other YA novels out there that tells the reader that love can cure no matter what ails you be it a mental health issue or a physical illness.... At the end of the day, this is a fictional story and Cyra does not suffer from a chronic illness per se (I'm incredibly aware that in future books there is a possibility for a narrative surrounding healing which I hope the author will not explore). But as this is fictional who am I to say that the experiences of Cyra shouldn't be written as they are. Veronica Roth has claimed that she experiences chronic pain and perhaps this is how she feels... It just is not my experience of life with pain.On the whole this is a very problematic book. It has issues with poor writing and character development to start with. There are potentially offensive racial undertones, an unflagged trigger warning regarding self-harm and what I believe is an ineffectual representation of chronic pain. But I don't think that Veronica Roth set out to be racist or ableist or any such thing. I believe that she is just a writer very much out of her depth lacking in proper guidance. I feel there is a sad indictment on the publishing industry that somehow allowed this book to slip through editing and proof reading with the presence of so many questionable aspects. So my last thoughts on this book are for Ms Roth and for her future writings. In the words of the great Samuel Beckett:\"Ever tried, ever failed, no matter. Try again, fail again, fail better.\" one star---------Reading this with my favourite book group.Some pre-reading/viewing surrounding the controversies:Justina Ireland Blog: The Trope of the Dark Skinned AgressorSaaba Tahir's defence of the racism issues Veronica Roth's 'Carve The Mark' Is A Fantasy Inspired By Chronic Pain : NPRThis gift sucks Veronica, where do I return it.

This book is interesting not because of it's story (which is dull) but because of the circumstances surrounding it's release. BLACK FACEEvery now and then a book comes along that presents some toxic ideas which are commonly seen in tons of books. But our GoodReads community turns into a hive mind and decides this one book is the absolute worst. I can't help but feel that this book got unlucky. The Winner's Curse was gushed about despite it's disgusting representation of colonialism and slavery. Sarah Maas had published a dozen books, short stories and novellas before readers started to grumble about the lack of LGBT characters. Mark Lawrence, Prince of Thorns and Patrick Rothfuss got almost no flack for their sexist stereotypes. So the question becomes- are people outraged by the offensive stereotypes or are they just unable to ignore them because the story was subpar? Race in fantasy is a difficult thing. Most writers avoid it entirely, it's a chronic truism that if the book is a fantasy then you can assume everyone is white. In Carve the Mark I'm not sure there was any way for Roth to avoid this controversy. She set up a situation in which two cultures clash. Providing any sort of racial markers to either group was going to cause a reaction. For the criticism of ableism- all I can really add is people who experience disability or chronic pain are likely to have the clearest perspective on this but since there are entire spiritual practices devoted to incorporating pain into knowledge of god it would probably be useful to remember that there is not one right way to write about difficult experiences. The most useful discussion around this stuff is seeing if the writer correctly identified a possible response to a human experience. They aren't representing your experience. If every time a writer tried to write about an experience they don't have personal knowledge of they got lambasted\u2026 well good luck getting any marginalised experiences into print. Perhaps the backlash against this novel will be an important marker to writers and publishers alike? God knows I've gritted my teeth thru enough \"white saviour\", \"black aggressor\", \"magical negro\" and \"noble savage\" stereotypes to be eager to see these tropes die out. Maybe Roth's new book is the bloody sacrifice needed to make publishers sit up and take notice? In which case this mediocre book can be said to have done some real good in the literary world. But I can't help suspecting this novel will be thrown on a pyre righteous of indignation like other outliers before it is ignobly forgotten. \nReaders will continue to eat up sexist and racist stories because the characters are swoon worthy, the plot is thrilling or the reader's who object are \"oversensitive sjw's\".\n This controversy is food for thought for writers and readers alike. Despite what some people claim stories are important cultural indicators. They shape and define how we experience and respond to the world around us. A story is never \"just a story\" and I'm pleased to see so many fellow readers engaging with subtext and connotation, rather then reviews full of gifs saying \"omfg love interest is soooo hawt\". BLOOD MONEY The second thing worth noting was the volume of paid reviews this book has on the front page. There are a ton of studies that show how being financially paid to review a product unconsciously inflates reviewers' scores. This is the first novel I've come across on GR were the front page was saturated with paid reviews. GR has been fiercely defended as a place created for readers by readers (and the bloody remnants of many writing careers can still be found scattered across the site). In a world of tightly controlled image creation GR members have managed to carve out a space that can be downright vicious to anyone who tries to infiltrate the community for commercial purposes. \nAs a community we need to think carefully about accepting paid reviews as a common practice.\n It destroys authenticity. Most regular users are voracious readers. It would be wonderful if we could all earn a living by reading books. But here's the thing: you won't. Even if a tiny fraction of readers manage to earn a living wage reviewing books it will be at the cost of their personal integrity and the community's effectiveness. Goodreads works because it is real. It is genuine word of mouth supercharged across the globe. Marketers might be drooling to get a slice of the PR pie but we as members decide whether that is organic, authentic acclaim or... not.There is a very real risk if this trend continues that GR will become an advertisement billboard. Our choices now will determine the future of goodreads. If you see a review that is paid for don't like it. Let the other member know you are unhappy with their decision to accept payment for a review. These are two really easy things members can do to curb these trends. If paid reviews get no \"likes\" and languish on the 20th page publishers won't bother trying to curate the book's image. Likewise, if members see that accepting paid reviews breaks their friends trust, they won't accept them. How we address commercial encroachment in Good Reads matters. I don't come to GR to read 30 paid ads on the book I'm about to read, do you?Edit: Some booktubers and reviewers have vigorously defended themselves. I wanted to add evidence to my claim that the inflation in reviews occurs \neven where the reviewers believe they are being objective\n:https://reviewmeta.com/blog/analysis-...Although this refers to amazon reviews I think it provides sufficient evidence for the same problem on GR.For further evidence of how fucked up it is having sponsored reviews on goodreads see Riley's review  Which describes how her contact was dissolved when she notified the publisher she would be writing a negative review.

This book tries to YA too hard2. This book tries to Sci-fi too hard3. This book tries to world build too hardI do give it 3 stars because overall I found it enjoyable, but the the things above distracted me so much. (Note: Lowered to two stars on 10/17/2017 because I thought I already gave it too and I keep thinking back to how much I didn't care for it . . . so, I had to drop it!)YA - There is a general YA formula, but if you mix it in well with a creative story, it doesn't matter if it has the same themes and general plot lines. This book wore YA on its sleeve - young love between enemies, siblings trying to save each other, every main character except the protagonists parents is between the age of 14 and 19. I could go on.Sci-fi - I am still not sure why interplanetary travel was important in this story, but it happened. Mysterious powers that just so happen to be the most advantageous to the person who has them or convenient to the storyline. It really felt like Roth just wanted this book to be in space and threw out some special high tech weirdness to make it feel like other Sci-fi YA offerings (I was frequently reminded of Red Rising - which I did not care for very much)World building - Oh man, names, locations, traditions, races - one big confusing mashup! This distracted me the most. So many weird names and odd relationships I had a hard time keeping track of what was going on. The locations and travel were not very clear (see Sci-fi above). I couldn't tell if they were on one planet, several planets, what the ultimate political structure was, etc. Maybe all this is clear for some, but I was lost a lot of the time. Despite all of this, though, I did enjoy the story and was not disappointed in the plot and cliffhangers for a sequel. I just hope Roth doesn't try so hard to do what is expected."}, {"userName": "Chelsea \u2764Peril Please\u2764 ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8422853-chelsea-peril-please", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Nenia \u2728 Queen of Literary Trash, Protector of Out-of-Print Gems, Khaleesi of Bodice Rippers, Mother of Smut, the Unrepentant, Breaker of Convention \u2728 Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190064-nenia-queen-of-literary-trash-protector-of-out-of-print-gems-khalees", "userReview": "Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestDivergent Wars: One Force will define you. Curious (and polite) people kept asking me if I was enjoying CARVE THE MARK while I was reading it. For the flippant response to that question, please refer to the opening of the song \"Nobody But Me\" by The Human Beinz. Or, you know, check out my star rating. (But my way is more fun, and you get a fun song out of it, too!)I was one of the few people who did not like DIVERGENT. Part of that was the world-building that didn't make sense, and part of that was what I perceived as jarring anti-intellectualism. You might say I'm being oversensitive. Maybe. Or maybe the author's choice to make the intellectual faction into what were basically a bunch of fascists did not sit well with me. And no, I'm not just saying that because I scored as \"erudite\" in that stupid faction quiz. (Well, mostly. *sniff, sniff* I'm not a fascist!)When I heard that Roth was penning a new series of books, I was skeptical. Especially when it was being blurbed as a cross between Star Wars and DIVERGENT. I liked one of those things very much, but would space opera and the compelling promise of vengeance and battles be enough to compensate for the DIVERGENT similarities? And, more importantly, how would her style evolve? Or would it be more BS about smart people wrecking society and brave people jumping out of trains?CARVE THE MARK is a very weird book - and, to its credit, is a very different story from DIVERGENT. It's about the Thuhve, a \"peace-loving\" people, and the Shotet, an opportunistic and war-like people who are ruled by a \"tyrant\" and who carve marks denoting their kills into their forearms. Akos, the Thuhvian, is taken capture by the Shotet's ruler, Rhyzek, along with his brother, because his brother has the power of prophecy. Cyra is Rhyzek's sister, and has the ability to cause people incredible pain - or even death - upon physical contact. Rhyzek uses her to do his dirty work and to put fear into his people.The power source in this book is something called the \"current,\" which from what I gathered is like a cross between the \"Lifestream\" in Final Fantasy VII and the Force in Star Wars. It's a physical thing of immense power that people can draw upon, creating \"currentblades\" (e.g. lightsabers) and being born with \"currentgifts\" (e.g. the Force) that manifest in different ways to do different things.Okay, cool. A little derivative, but hey, super powers aren't exactly a novel concept, and I'm always down to read about them if done well. What's 100% original these days, anyway? Exactly.But I could not get into CARVE THE MARK at all. It felt very amateurish. It was too long, and the characters were not developed at all. At least Tris had some emotional complexity to her and the romance between Four and Tris was compelling (and arguably the best part of the story). On the other hand, the romance between Cyra and Akos has zero chemistry, and when they start talking about being in love with each other it comes totally out of left field because, again, zero evidence for it (that I perceived - by that point, I was skimming pretty heavily, and I may have missed a telltale \"clue\").CARVE THE MARK read like a very bad debut for me, with shoddy world building, a cliche and cowardly villain, and two heroes who don't really have any interesting personality traits or conflicts. I'm honestly shocked by how unpleasant the experience of reading this was, and if I had read this without knowing who the author was, I might have thought that this was a cleaned-up self-published effort or a debut tentatively put forth by a first-time (and very young) author.I'm honestly disappointed because I love space opera - it's one of my favorite genres - and I was hoping to see a mainstream author write a glowing example of it, because if space opera boomed like the dystopian genre did in the late 2000s, I'd be one happy gal.Maybe it will, but let's not make this book the poster child for the movement.1 star."}, {"userName": "Bibi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33411728-bibi", "userReview": "01/26/2017Having spent the last hour reading through Review 1, Review 2, Tweets, opinion posts, in addition to the comments threads, there seems to be a whole lot of furore about this book which, I must say, now has me intrigued enough to want to read Carve the Mark. A few reviewers felt the need to disclaim previous reviews, while some bloggers sought to distance themselves from both the author and HarperTeen, the publishers. My understanding is that one, the book has racial undertones, the author's allusion to chronic pain as a source of strength for one of the characters is another problematic issue.Empathy, I understand.

Maybe after Divergent my expectations were too high, and it probably not fair to compare the tow although when a book is released saying the writer of Divergent it is hard not to expect a lot and compare the two. Also knowing Veronica Roth was a Star Wars fan and I am a Star Wars fan I figured what could possible go wrong.The book is very slow then as soon as something exciting happens it is the end of the chapter and the moment is lost. Worse still in some cases of the cross over of the chapters it could be a couple of minutes later, a couple of hours, a day or in one case 2 years. There are a few short but brutal fight scattered around the book. Unfortunately for me there was not particularly well written. I know she thanks a friend who helped her choreograph the fight now in my mind I don't see how someone can strike with a knife with one hand then simultaneously (still in a standing position), remove a hidden blade from their boot and stab the person with it? The narration of the book is split between the two main characters. Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth. Like in the Divergent I think Veronica Roth is better a writing the female characters like Cyra. There are also mistakes in Akos narration (yes my grammar is not great so if I noticed it obvious), it is supposed to be first person like Cyra's but as he moves around it keeps he moved here or there he did that like someone is watching him.Here the Current is the energy/life force believed to flow through everyone. It bestows gifts on everyone some good, some bad and some useless. these gifts seem to be extensions of the person personalities. it is unknown if the person personality brings their \"gift\" or if they are this way because they are going to receive a certain \"gift\". The Current also seems to be harnessed in machines and is the basis for most of their technology. There are also the Oracles people who have been gifted to see the future, but they seem to be a law on to themselves. The planet Thuvhe is home to both the Thuvhe and Shotet people. Even though it is know interplanetary as Thuvhe. This because the Thuvhe farmers control the worlds biggest export of Hush and Ice flowers. The Shotet seem to be the more vicious and warrior people, and are known for marking kills by scaring their arms. Even though they are supposed to be the more \"closed off\" society they are more traveled people as part of their religious believes is a annual sojourn to a planet directed by the Currents and take there discarded technology and \"garbage\" back for renewal. When the Oracles decide to make peoples fates public the Shotet people make a daring move against the Thuvhe and Akos' family in general. Ryzek Noavek the ruler of Shotet (and Cyra's brother) will do anything to change his fate and show his people he is not weak.As much as I wanted to like this book I just don't, it is slow paced then skips ahead and tries to fill in blanks later. Also for suck a big book. Not much seems to happen for me too much stuff is left undone especially by the end of the book. if like me you have been fans Roth's previous books, all I can say it did not live up to my expectations."}, {"userName": "Sana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26402455-sana", "userReview": "BR with the evil little pie. <3Dnf @ page 88This book is putting Maggie and I in a slump, not to mention extremely boring and slow."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose", "userReview": "Long review for a rather long read. I'm still struggling to figure what words are appropriate to describe the mediocrity and utter pointlessness of this book. My thoughts about it aren't as concise as this review will turn out being, because I only have so many words to fit in my review space and I want to illustrate why this book ended up being such a horrible experience. It's my worst read of 2017 thus far, though I considered giving it credit for at least the last quarter of the book holding my attention (Honestly though, slogging through 80% of this only to get to intriguing scenes of action/character stake investment? Not worth it, definitely not worth it) . I'm a fast reader, it wasn't the length of this book that deterred me - my library copy clocked in just around 460 some pages - but this book was such a tedious, offensive mess. Before I address the most pervasively discussed problems in this narrative (i.e. how racist and and ablelist this book is on several levels. There isn't an argument to be made about that - it exists in this book even if the author herself doesn't realize that it does in this narrative, and I picked up on it in several instances in this narrative, probably more than I can direct quote in this review. I'll do my best to illustrate these points using quotes from the text where I can, though), I'll discuss the aspects of this book that are a little easier for me to address in quick notation.As a bit of background, I had actually planned to read this book quite a while back. My experiences with Roth's books have been rocky to say the least. I thought \"Divergent\" was okay (though with issues), \"Insurgent\" was less okay (with more issues, but it held my attention still) and \"Allegiant\" was just...not good is putting it mildly. But I figured I'd give \"Carve the Mark\" a chance because it had all the bullet points of a series I might like. It's sci-fi, it's set in space, involves political intrigue and manipulation of powers/unique abilities of its cast, has some romantic inclinations, and involves a purportedly epic clash between different groups of people. (I'm deliberately ignoring the comparisons to Star Wars/X-Men because that sets up unrealistic expectations, and I don't buy into that kind of hype.) I started hearing about issues with this narrative on the day of release, and several of my Goodreads friends and trusted bloggers had mixed reactions to it as well. I'm thinking \"Oh crud, glad I didn't preorder it. I still want to read it; maybe I should just get it from the library if it doesn't have ten billion holds.\" On one of my routine trips to my library, I saw the book on the shelf and was wondering like \"Can I actually check this out?\" Turns out I could, and I did, and my initial thoughts were whether I was lucky to get one or if I'd set myself up for disappointment.The long and short of \"Carve the Mark's\" story centers on the conflict between two space societies: the Thuvue and the Shotet. People in this world have unique abilities called currentgifts, which by definition in the glossary of the story \"develop during puberty. They are not always benevolent.\" The story attempts to showcase the perspectives of Akos and Cyra from those nations respectively. Akos and his brother Eijeh, after a series of violent events, are kidnapped by the Shotet and made to use their currentgifts for the benefit of Cyra's family. Eijeh is subjected under the influence of Cyra's tyrannical brother Rhyzek, while Akos uses his abilities to aid Cyra. Cyra is a young woman whose existence is tormented by her currentgift, but yet she enacts her brother's will by serving as a weapon under his direct command. Cyra doesn't want to hurt anyone or serve as her brother's weapon in their kingdom, but her ability impedes her and can't escape the guilt of a secret (read: not so secret) that hangs over her head - both by her brother's influence and her own guilt. Cyra and Akos have a rocky relationship with competing interests at first, but as they learn about each other's experiences, they grow closer romantically and end up making plans to take Rhyzek down. Of course this journey isn't without a few curveballs (supposedly, I honestly didn't find them that shocking) the narrative throws at the reader in the end, and apparently leaves to continue in this purported duology.While this summary of the story wouldn't seem so terrible when taken by that barebones approach, there were so many things wrong with \"Carve The Mark\" in execution that it's difficult to know where to begin. The pacing in the novel is atrociously sluggish, starting with very little conflict or explanation and meandering more often than not (I found this to be a similar problem in Roth's \"Alliegiant\"). The worldbuilding is weakly drawn from the beginning, and the presentation of the world is awkward and confusing. For a book that blends sci-fi and fantasy in a space centered universe - there's never a chance to become immersed or invested in the environment. Granted, this is a universe where Oracles determine the fates of people with currentgifts and note how their gifts influence the balance of power between the societies. Akos and Cyra come from two powerful families and have powerful gifts that they develop over time, though there isn't much attention to the system by which this works (what little there is comes across as confusing). \"Carve the Mark\" trades between their perspectives, starting with Akos in third person, while Cyra's perspective is written in first person POV.It was hard to care for any of the cast of characters in this book other than Cyra. Cyra had the more prominent storyline and scenetime, while Akos's perspective suffered from being too emotionally distant despite some purportedly harrowing experiences. Add to the fact that Roth chose to telegraph certain experiences and emotions of the characters - withholding certain revelations key to the storyline for no particular reason at all (and you could guess what those revelations were without getting too far into the storyline - I predicted them fairly quickly.) The narrative would've benefited from them being shown and fleshed out much more than the attention they received. So, the writing and establishment of the plot was much weaker than it would've otherwise been with greater care and time taken to develop the world. Don't even get me started on the one-note side characters and villains. For a reportedly violent sci-fi world with prominent clashes, when certain characters bit the bullet, I found it hard to care because I really didn't feel like I knew the characters in this novel that well. Even Ryzek's motivations felt paperthin despite the attempt to showcase his flaws and eventually the rationale he uses to manipulate his sister into being his weapon of choice to enact his assertion of power. Cyra and Akos's characters had a few scenes where I could believe in their chemistry and slow burning relationship, but I felt my connection to them was shortchanged because of the way the narrative chose to not only push them together for convenient circumstance, but ultimately the narrative becoming another example in problematic YA tropes for I can heal your problems with the power of love! These are just the mentions of structural and narrative issues with \"Carve the Mark\" without mentioning the problematic presentation of themes and depictions in the work. And it's perhaps the racist and ableist depictions that showcase not only how lazy the construction of this work really was, but how it attempted to incorporate such themes in a flawed and insensitive way.It may be ironic of me to point out this video of Roth talking about the importance of portrayal of race in this narrative but I honestly think that despite the intention of *trying* to be inclusive of different races with her intentional incorporation of skin tones and hair textures - she completely misses the point of what it means to be inclusive. When you are writing minority characters accurately, you are dealing with more than just an incorporation of skin tones. I think that point bears repeating:  When you are writing minority characters accurately, you are dealing with more than just an incorporation of skin tones. Part of the problem with certain portrayals of minority groups in fiction, including in sci-fi and fantasy, is that there's a history of harmful stereotypes of minority groups in comparison to White/Caucasian or majority groups. This stereotyping is very evident in numerous areas of \"Carve the Mark\". I felt that Justina Ireland did a fine job of pointing out just a few of these problems alongside quoting some examples where this is noted in the text. But these are only just a few examples.This book was ethnocentric from the very beginning against the Shotet group, and that never changed through the entire story.Chapter 1: \"The Shotet were a people, not a nation-planet, and they were known to be fierce, brutal. They stained lines into their arms for every life they had taken, and trained even their children in the art of war. And they lived on Thuvhe, the same planet as Akos and his family\u2014though the Shotet didn\u2019t call this planet \u201cThuvhe,\u201d or themselves \u201cThuvhesits\u201d\u2014across a huge stretch of feathergrass. The same feathergrass that scratched at the windows of Akos\u2019s family\u2019s house.\" \u201cSometimes it is easy to see why people become what they are,\u201d his mom said softly. \u201cRyzek and Cyra, children of a tyrant. Their father, Lazmet, child of a woman who murdered her own brothers and sisters. The violence infects each generation.\u201d <- This is Akos's mother telling him about how harmful the Shotet people are. (Prejudice is a dish served cold in this narrative, apparently.)Chapter 2: Akos knew it without really knowing it: These men were Shotet. Enemies of Thuvhe, enemies of theirs. People like this were responsible for every candle lit in the memorial of the Shotet invasion; they had scarred Hessa\u2019s buildings, busted its glass so it showed fractured images; they had culled the bravest, the strongest, the fiercest, and left their families to weeping. Akos\u2019s grandmother and her bread knife among them, so said their dad. <- There's the dehumanization and use of \"they\" - think \"Save the Pearls\" problematic attributions.\u201cNo woman,\u201d one of the men said to one of the others. \u201cWonder where she is?\u201d \u201cOracle,\u201d one of the others replied. \u201cNot an easy one to catch.\u201d \u201cI know you speak our language,\u201d Aoseh said, sterner this time. \u201cStop jabbering away like you don\u2019t understand me.\" Because you would have your darker skinned enemies speak a broken form of your prevalent language.Chapter 3: \u201cToday,\u201d she told me, \u201cis the first day that most Shotet will lay eyes on you, not to mention the rest of the galaxy. The last thing we want is for them to fixate on your hair. By fixing it up, we make it invisible. Understand?\u201d I didn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t press the issue. I was looking at my mother\u2019s hair. It was dark, like mine, but a different texture\u2014hers was so curly it trapped fingers, and mine was just straight enough to escape them. My mouth dropped open at this inclusion because it's bad enough that people of color are often degraded by their natural hair types or forced to conform to some standard of beauty, and this serves to reinforce cultural self-hate of appearances in favor of the \"majority\" group's hair type. WTF man? Chapter 15: \u201cI\u2019m not a fool, no matter what you people think of the Thuvhesit,\u201d Akos snapped, his cheeks going ruddy as he picked up the practice blade. \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to just let you set me up for a fall?\u201d <- \"You people\" again. Dehumanizing language.\u201cSo you, what? Leap straight to killing him? What is it with you Shotet?\u201d Akos said in a low voice.  Akos says this to a Shotet person who makes a bargain with him, involving killing someone. Casual prejudicial assumptions even from the LI. Ugh. This is an offshoot of the same conversation in the mention above.There are a number of times when Cyra participates in her own self-hatred for identity, not just for what she's done and the secret she holds, but also her own ease of disposition for violence. This is contrasted against Akos, for when he subjects himself to a contract kill versus killing for survival, he's disgusted and nearly breaks down over the death. One could almost argue that in some ways Cyra corrupts him and he \"fixes\" her as his love interest, which I thought was pretty messed up in the context of the story.As far as the ableism goes, this book portrays such in two dimensions: chronic pain and self-harm/attributions to self-cutting. This narrative portrays the Shotet in demonizing way with respect to the novel's namesake \"Carve the Mark\". Chapter 15: Akos rubbed at the marks by his elbow, and thought of the savagery of them. Keep in mind this is a custom of the Shotet, and figures that he'd refer to it in some way as being \"savage.\"The most damning quote I found was one I partially quoted in my status updates.Chapter 14: \"Says the person who\u2019s been scarring herself for things she was coerced into doing,\u201d he said wryly. It wasn\u2019t funny, what either of us was saying. And then it was. I grinned, and after a moment, so did he. A new grin\u2014not the one that told me he was proud of himself, or the one that he forced when he felt like he needed to be polite, but a thirsty, crazed kind of smile.  Basically the context of this is that Cyra was talking about how she marked herself not for the number of kills she made with her ability but for every time she had pain. I think this is triggering for people who may have recovered from some degree of self-harm/cutting. And the fact that Akos and Cyra laugh about it made me want to throw the book down in disgust, even if it is bitter/dark humor. It's not funny.And definitely not cool to romanticize chronic pain in the form of an attempted sacrifice:Chapter 25: Akos\u2019s eyes\u2014full of tears, full of pain\u2014found mine. Pushing the shadow toward him would have been easy. I had done it many times before, each time a mark on my left arm. All I had to do was let the connection form, let the pain pass between us like a breath, like a kiss. Let all of it flow out of me, bringing relief for us both, in death. But he did not deserve it. This time, I broke the connection, like slamming a door between us. I pulled the pain back, into myself, willing my body to grow darker and darker, like a bottle of pink. I shuddered with the force of that power, that agony. I didn\u2019t scream. I wasn\u2019t afraid. I knew I was strong enough to survive it all.I feel like there were more problems in this book than I could care to cite as far as the portrayals were concerned. I understood that this was supposed to be a narrative showcasing two very flawed characters put in extraordinary circumstances and brought together under those terms, but taking and appropriating from established cultures and loosely building a narrative with many haphazard stereotypes, some even affirming awful and harmful attributions, is really messed up. Romanticizing pain, including measures out of the control of the person suffering from it, isn't acceptable either.I definitely won't be reading the next book in this series. And I'm unlikely even to pick up another narrative by Roth in the future.Overall score: 1/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51318038-maggie", "userReview": "DNF @ 22% Sana and I are bored and are being put in a reading slump reading this.

I'll probably rate it, and I will look for the issues it has, but writing a review won't be necessary since it's already become a big problem.I don't know what it is, but there are some links here that talk about the book and give out some of the points on how this book has issues that people should look out for:- http://westwoodhorizon.com/11392/show...- http://justinaireland.com/dammit-this...- http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifesty...- https://writtenwordworlds.wordpress.c...- http://aragonoutlook.org/2017/02/roth...- http://sabaatahir.tumblr.com/post/156..."}, {"userName": "Simona Bartolotta", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5312173-simona-bartolotta", "userReview": "EDIT 11/02/2017/: Lowering my rating to two stars because holy moley, I already don't remember a thing of what happened in this book. And I read it, like, a month ago. This is Lady Midnight happening to me all over again. Is it my memory's fault or these run-of-the-mill-yet-super-popular books'?---\u201cGrowing up here really has warped you, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cGrowing up here,\u201d I clarified, \u201chas made me see the truth about people.\u201d\u2022I feel that a foreword is needed here. First, I read the Divergent trilogy a little over two years ago, before the first movie -the only one I watched- was released, and the series as a whole impressed me so little I reckon my mind let my memories of it fade by default. So if what you need is a detailed comparison between the Divergent series and Carve the Mark, this is not the review you're looking for. Secondly, I feel duty-bound to let you know that Carve the Mark has raised issues regarding racism and cultural stereotypes and the author's thoughts about chronic illnesses -also with reference to this interview. Here I won't comment on the substance of the matter; I'll only say that before starting the book, I had no idea of the uproar surrounding it, and that I didn't find out until later, when I was almost done with it. Which means, yes, that I picked up none of these issues while reading, but then again, I am white and I have no first-hand experience of what it means to cope with a chronic condition, so I do not fall into that category of people who are likely to be touched by them. I feel like it's not my place to pass judgement on this; so please do not be offended by my not-totally-negative opinion of the book. I mean no disrespect whatsoever, I am glad that the problem has been duly pointed out and I'm sorry for all the readers who may have been hurt by this.\u2022Strangely enough, when it comes to this novel I seem to be more inclined to dwell on the things I won't talk about than on those few points I could actually wring something out of. First things first, then: I was deeply fascinated with the concept lying at the basis of this world-building, namely, this unspecified current that flows across the whole universe, and to which the gifts, special powers that manifest differently for each individual, are due. The explanation of this phenomenon is that since each person is unique, when the energy of the current fills them, it takes different shapes, and hence the difference in the powers. I found this idea very simple, yet very suggestive, and logically convincing too, which is never to be undervalued.\u2022Sadly, this single fact was the only thing that genuinely struck me as original and truly thought-out. The rest of the world building was to me not bad, but rather dull and unsurprising, and not perfectly laid out if we're being honest. In this world, many -some? Anyway, more than one- planets are inhabited by humans, but I couldn't gather exactly how many and why; plus, the names of these planets and their peoples are mentioned more than once along with inconsequential facts like, for instance, that Ogra culture worships mystery (what does that even mean, for goodness sake) but that doesn't help you getting a clearer picture at all. It basically fills up your mind with random names you're bound to forget once the paragraph is over. \u2022The pace -good gracious, the pace. It's no secret that Veronica Roth never really knew what to do with this alien thing, and the obvious result is, I got bored with Insurgent, I got bored with Allegiant, and I got bored with Carve the Mark. (I believe Divergent is exempted simply because back then Roth was still too inexperienced a writer to realize that the pace is something you need to pay attention to; see the irony in this?) The first part, more introductory, was made interesting by the novelty of the world and of the characters, but the second part is really tough to get through. The writing, being not particularly brilliant and, again, simply average, doesn't help much; the same applies to the plot.\u2022In spite of everything I said so far, I found the main characters, Cyra and Akos, to be compelling enough, which definitely helped in making it to the end of the book. Ad for the rest of the cast, well, I liked the villain, but apart from these three, no one else is worth special mention.\u27bd Since that little yet so charming detail in the world-building won me over so thoroughly, and since I am genuinely curious to know how some of the dynamics established between some of the characters will play out, I will be picking the sequel up. I didn't love it, but if what you're looking for is a world for you to flee to, a story for you to relax with, then Carve the Mark is as good any."}, {"userName": "Joshua Gabriel (\uc870\uc218\uc544)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8832758-joshua-gabriel", "userReview": "What a person did when they were in pain said a lot about them. \u2014AkosYey, I finally finished reading this controversial book. Before I even picked it up, I did some extensive research just because so many people were ranting about it. I watched reviews on YouTube, which were rarely positive in tone. Heck, I even saw a video wherein the BookTuber burst into tears because of all the stress this book had been giving her. Of course, I was quite moved by all of the drama surrounding the release of Carve the Mark. Still, I wanted to remain as objective as possible, so I also perused the Web for Veronica Roth's written and recorded responses. After reading her blog post (which addressed the issues of racism and ableism), I eventually mustered enough courage to read this book. To my surprise, it was a month-long journey.Carve the Mark is a thousand miles away from the Divergent Trilogy. The novel is set in a fantastical universe where a literally flowing entity called the Current surrounds nine unique planets. If you've read Under the Never Sky by Veronica Rossi, you can imagine the Current as the aurora-borealis-like Aether. Personally, the Current reminded me of the Lifestream in Final Fantasy VII. :D Anyways, like the Aether in UTNS, the Current in CTM gives humans supernatural abilities. However, in the case of Cyra Noavek, her gift is more like a curse because it racks her body (and others) with constant pain. The story kicks off when she meets Akos Kereseth, a supposed enemy who can nullify the Current and thereby ease her pain. (Trigger warning for Feminists xD)From the get go, I want you to know that I wasn't so hurt or bothered by this book. Thankfully, it did not overwhelm me with angst, hatred, or sadness. If anything, the worst feeling it evoked in me was boredom. The first hundred pages were especially info-dumpy, and I found myself struggling to stay awake. It didn't help that there were so many side characters with ridiculous names. With that in mind, reading this book required a lot of effort and patience.My reading experience became somewhat better when I became familiar with the complex world and the author's quite different writing style (i.e. Cyra's chapters are in first person, while Akos's are in third person). I was specifically intrigued by Cyra's interactions with her villainous brother, Ryzek. In spite of their filial connection, it was clear that they did not love each other at all. As for the romance between Cyra and Akos, I thought that it was reminiscent to that of Divergent's Tris and Four. How so? It also happened because of multiple training sessions. Ha-ha. Looking at the bright side, at least what they had was not instalove.Among the many characters in this book, Cyra was strangely my favorite. I found her very entertaining because she exhibited what I like to call Tris Syndrome. Like Tris, Cyra wasn't aware of the fine line between bravery and stupidity. Also, she could be selfless to a fault. Basically, Cyra's uncanny similarity to Tris gave me a feeling of nostalgia, as well as a cynical kind of pleasure. :p As a final note, I can confirm that this might trigger readers who have suffered from self-harm; There are scenes where the protagonists use heated knives to scar their arms. As for the racism issue, I actually did not detect any kind of discrimination against people of color; not all Shotet are dark-skinned \"barbarians,\" and not all Thuvesits are pale-skinned \"hippies.\" Overall, I am glad that I gave Veronica Roth the benefit of the doubt. Still, I cannot say that this is her finest work. Otherwise, this book wouldn't have been so controversial."}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "2.5 stars, rounding down because WTF kind of ending was that?I'll just get this out of the way: I hated Allegiant, but I really liked Divergent and Insurgent. This is a very different kind of book. It's sci-fi. Set in space and on other planets. The people are basically human and look and act the same as us (except for some hard to pronounce names). In this world, there is a current that runs through everything. Some people worship it, some view it in scientific terms. It gives everyone a currentgift. Healing, visions, the ability to withstand pain, the ability to give pain, etc. etc.The story focuses on a young man and woman who belong to warring families that hate each other. One is kidnapped and taken to their enemies' land where he slowly builds a relationship with the sister of his kidnapper. There's The Evil Bad Guy. Another brother who was also kidnapped and becomes a shell of what he once was due to The Evil Bad Guy using him for his currentgift.I went from really liking it, to liking it okay, and then I just started to get annoyed. This was boring in a lot of places. It did not need to be 500 pages long. There just wasn't enough plot to justify that. I didn't really feel anything for any of the characters. I did like the two main leads, but their romance was very meh.The whole thing was meh. And the action at the end didn't improve anything and actually made it worse. It's like the story just ended with a lot of things unresolved. How annoying.I have heard that some people think this book is racist? I did not see any racism in this. In fact, skin tone was rarely mentioned, and people in all the different cultures had different hair color and skin tones. I've read fantasy where \"fair-skinned\" people scarred themselves. I saw no racism. It was just an okay, mostly boring book. I'm disappointed because it seemed like it would be good. The premise was good. But there was no real meat.It just ended up feeling really generic. I gave Roth another chance, but I am done now. This was an unsatisfying read.Edit: Now I see it is actually the first book and another one is planned. NO THANKS!

This is not going to be pretty. I\u2019m sure you have seen all the upchucked Haterade that the \u201ccontroversy brigade\u201d so generously spewed about this book before and after it\u2019s release. So obviously, I wanted to love this book SO HARD if only to shove a raving review in the face of absurdity! Unfortunately, I can\u2019t do that here.*sulks*On the other hand \u2026 I honestly did not see ANY of the controversy. Like \u2026 where is it? I have no idea. I\u2019m sure some \u201chelpful\u201d person will take the time to \u201cenlighten\u201d me in the comments below (hint: don\u2019t. Because I honestly don't care). Sadly, large portions of this book were just confusing and slow. But we will start with the positives \u2026 because I\u2019m not a complete asshole.What I did likeThe best part of this book (for me) was all the culture building Roth so intricately weaved together for this world. Some of you may find this part a bit info-dumpy \u2026 but I'm a total nerd for stuff like this so I loved it! All the fascinating religious beliefs, languages, history. Yeah \u2026 totally my jam and I ate it with a spoon and a smile. These are the things that shape a society. These are the things that create diversity, discrimination, conflict and war! These are the things that help to shape an individual (along with personal experience and learned/inherited behavior). Which brings me to another thing I loved about this book.Roth did an incredible job building her characters from a psychological standpoint. Personal histories were laid beautifully throughout this book, making the characters intricate and intriguing and real. People are not black or white, good or bad. People are tapestries of gray with shades of every manner of influence woven through. All broken, all healing, all scared and walled and pieced in varying ways.I could continue on this subject for a while, inevitably meandering into a major psychology lecture the likes of which we many never escape \u2026 so I shall move along. But before I dive headfirst into negativity land \u2026 I want to acknowledge the fact that, while I will not take the time to chronicle each and every moment/plot-point/collection-of-words that I liked about this book, I did enjoy the story for the most part. It truly is a good concept and story, and with a good pair of scissors in the hand of a less forgiving editor, this would have been a much more successful read.What I did not likeWhat the fuck is going on? Where are we? What the hell is this place? How did we get here? What color are the walls?This is an example of the types of questions I may have asked myself while stumbling through this book. Let's face it, the descriptions of actual places were basically non-existent. I like to fancy myself as having a pretty active imagination, but even I had major trouble visualizing scenes while reading this. Honestly, the beginning of this book really roped me in (I quite enjoyed a good portion of the first part of this book). Unfortunately, the middle dropped all form entirely and became a cluster fuck of what-the-fucks \u2026 and it didn\u2019t get any better from there. To add to the utter confusion ... I often felt like I was missing huge chunks of time. Like ... we were here ... then all the sudden we\u2019re over there ... and I had no idea why or how. To say that a majority of this book was confusing as fuck would be an appropriate assessment. Confusing and slooooooow (and I don't mind slow but this was not a good slow). Honestly this was really my biggest and perhaps only complaint with this book. As I mentioned above, the concept and the story was actually quite decent. But when you can\u2019t focus because you are either confused or bored \u2026 a great concept really fails to hold sway. The point of fiction is to transfer your reader to another time/place/world. But in order for that to be effective, the world first has to be built. This was the utter failing of this book and unfortunately, it\u2019s a doozy. In ConclusionGreat concept. Good plot. Poor execution. Slow and confusing. I would not recommend."}, {"userName": "Alyssa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8472395-alyssa", "userReview": "I liked the story overall!

While most benefit from their currentgifts, Akos and Cyra do not\u2014their gifts make them vulnerable to others\u2019 control. Can they reclaim their gifts, their fates, and their lives, and reset the balance of power in this world?Cyra is the sister of the brutal tyrant who rules the Shotet people. Cyra\u2019s currentgift gives her pain and power\u2014something her brother exploits, using her to torture his enemies. But Cyra is much more than just a blade in her brother\u2019s hand: she is resilient, quick on her feet, and smarter than he knows.Akos is from the peace-loving nation of Thuvhe, and his loyalty to his family is limitless. Though protected by his unusual currentgift, once Akos and his brother are captured by enemy Shotet soldiers, Akos is desperate to get his brother out alive\u2014no matter what the cost. When Akos is thrust into Cyra\u2019s world, the enmity between their countries and families seems insurmountable. They must decide to help each other to survive\u2014or to destroy one another.What I Liked:Carve the Mark is absolutely worth the hype and the excitement, and it's definitely worth your time to read this book if you've been looking forward to reading it. Chances are, it won't disappoint you. In many ways, I liked this book a lot. But there were several specific things that might seem small or insignificant in the grand schemes of things, that ended up really bothering me. Hence, the three-star rating. This story is told by two characters - Akos, a Thuvhe, and Cyra, a Shotet. The Thuvhe are a peace-loving people living on Urek. The Shotet are more aggressive nomadic people that conquer various nations and planets. When he is fourteen, Akos is captured, along with his brother, by the Shotet, who kill his father in front of him. They are taken to the Shotet stronghold of Urek, ruled by Ryzek Noavek, a ruthless tyrant and older brother of Cyra. They are stolen for their currentgifts - Akos's brother Eijeh is the next oracle of the Thuvhe. Akos grows into his currentgift - he can interrupt the current (he can cancel it out, turn it off, that sort of thing). Several years later, Akos is shaped into a warrior, but he has lost known of his humanity. He is not a killer, though he has killed to protect himself. He is brought to help Cyra Noavek, whose currentgift is inflicting pain on others with her touch. No one can touch her without feeling pain, but Akos can, because he interrupts the current (and all currentgifts are \"fueled\" by the current). Akos cooperates because he wants to rescue his brother and flee. But the more he and Cyra interact, the more they learn about each other, and the more they realize that they share common interests, interests that could incite wars.The beginning of the book was incredibly confusing (I'll talk about that in the next section), but once I (sort of) got a grasp of the world and everything going on, I started to get into the story and really sink into it. This is science fiction, though certain elements (like the currentgifts) can definitely be categorized as fantasy. This story takes place across planets of a galaxy, so it's a space-y type of science fiction. I must say, Roth did an excellent job with the characterization and character growth, specifically in terms of Cyra and Akos. I'll start with Akos. He is easily my favorite character of the book. He is Thuvhe, and so he is brought up to be more peaceful and somewhat passive towards violence. Even several years being trained as a Shotet soldier doesn't break him down. He is compassionate, and he is strong. I liked him a lot, especially for his unbreakable will. I was amazing and in awe of how much pain and grief and despair he bore, for years. Akos grows into a character that still hates killing, and is sick over having to kill anyone, but can do it. He becomes so strong and capable in other ways, and he's also extremely intelligent and clever. He isn't an alpha type of YA hero - he's quietly intelligent and very, very human. Cyra is almost the opposite of him, yet it slowly becomes apparent that she has similarities to him. She appears to be a brutal, cold, emotionless killer summoned and used by her brother, Ryzek. But Cyra does not enjoy wielding her painful power over others, and she definitely does not enjoy bending to Ryzek's will. In many ways, it is Akos who shows her mercy, what mercy is, and that she is still capable of being merciful, and better, and more. Cyra learns to turn her pain into something else. She loses none of her deadliness and her danger, but as the story goes on, she becomes stronger and more able to stand up to Ryzek.Once I got past the first one hundred pages or so, I had little difficulty getting through the story. I was pretty engrossed and despite the book being rather long, I read it quickly. There is so much happening in this story, and I wanted to see how it would all end. There were so many moments when things could go disastrously wrong, and I held my breath as I turned the pages. No one can say that certain parts of this book weren't engrossing. A lot of the story ends up being about how to unseat Ryzek, and how to stay alive and protect each other.There is romance! I liked seeing Akos and Cyra fall for each other. It's actually Cyra who shows her feelings first, which you wouldn't expect. Cyra is supposedly the more ruthless one, and Akos is the more emotional and merciful one. But it's Cyra that starts to fall for Akos first, and shows her hand first. I liked their dynamic a lot - they learn to trust each other before anything else. No love triangle! Thank goodness for that. I thought this romance was well-developed, and swoony towards the end.There is also another romance which I thought was sweet. I can't say much about it because it'll spoil things, but it's between two characters that are good together. The ending, as insane and chaotic as it is, is not a cruel ending. There is no horrible cliffhanger, which is surprising, since this is book one of a duology. You'd expect something really terrible to have happened at the end, hurting the main character(s). Don't get me wrong, terrible (permanent) things definitely happened; but the ending isn't a cliffhanger, and I definitely appreciate that.Now I'm going to talk about the things I didn't really enjoy. What I Did Not Like:First: the initial one hundred pages or so? Very confusing, and very boring too. I had a hard time getting through the beginning of the story. There is so much information dumped into the first couple of chapters, and so many names. It also took me a while to realize that the beginning is when Akos is fourteen - and NOT the \"present\" time of the story. Same with Cyra's beginning - she is six when her chapter begins. The beginning has too much going on, and it isn't well-explained at first. I had to reread several of the chapters a few times to really get some sort of grasp as to what was happening.I'm not sure I really understand the world/world-building? Currentgifts and their origin and how/why they exist still kind of elude me. What is the \"current\"? Where did it come from? How is it magically given people these currentgifts? The currentgifts are things like inflicting pain upon touch, or not feeling pain at all, or seeing the future, or seeing every memory of a person. Second: there are so many awful, brutal scenes in this book. I'm talking about torture and cruel treatment of people. I understand that this type of brutality is very real and exists in real life and has a place in this fictional world, but the brutality of a lot of it... didn't sit well with me. Usually a certain level of violence doesn't bother me too much? The violence in this book, while not exactly graphic, is horrifying. Which is probably the intent, but my stomach hurt, reading it. Third: Not the biggest thing I didn't like, but I wasn't a huge fan of having Akos's POV in third-person, and then Cyra's in first-person. I loved reading from both of their POVs! But it would have been nice to have a little uniformity (either both in first, or both in third). Also it already scares me, that Roth chooses to tell this story from both Akos and Cyra's POVs. We saw what happened in Allegiant...Fourth: problematic racial content. Oh yeah, I definitely see where people are coming from, when they say that this book has some racist content. The Shotet are portrayed as \"brown skinned\", aggressive, nomadic people. They stole Thuvhe children years ago, and the Thuvhe retaliated and stole Shotet children, but the way the story is told, the Shotet are the \"villains\". I mean, given that the first chapter is about Akos's father getting brutally murdered in front of him, I get why that would be implication. But there are definitely underlying tones of something problematic here: the Thuvhe, light-skinned peaceful people, and the Shotet, darker-skinned aggressive people, are both cliches. And what's more, it seems like most of the Shotet have very violent currentgifts, whereas the Thuvhe have more passive, non-violent gifts (like Akos's, or his mother's, or his brother's). Do you see the problem here? Why is it that the \"aggressive\" people are always the brown/darker-skinned ones, and the more \"peaceful\" non-violent people are lighter-skinned? I have no qualms with the characters themselves (I adore Akos, and Cyra is such a fighter), but the social construct here is reflective of cliches and stereotypes. Read THIS peace if you want more information. I definitely do not know it all, but I recognize and understand the issue at hand here, in terms of race and culture.Would I Recommend It:Yes, I had issues with this book, and I firmly believe that last issue needs to be addressed. And yes, I also enjoyed the book, for the most part, regardless. It's a good story, and I was definitely swept up in the story as I was reading. I'll be reading the sequel next year. I don't know if I really should recommend this book, given the evident issues. But I did like the story too. If you've been excited to read this book, believe me, it probably won't disappoint. But... recognize issues when you see them. Talk about them. Discuss and learn.Rating:3 stars. Like I said, this is a good story, and of all of Roth's books, it's probably her best. I think I liked it more than I liked her other books (definitely more than I liked Insurgent and Allegiant - though I never fully read Allegiant). I want to see where the story goes. But there were some things that held me back a little, in terms of my rating."}, {"userName": "Amber Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30813900-amber-robertson", "userReview": "I refuse to put myself in a position where the likelihood of myself being triggered is high.

I was curious about this book but after hearing several quotes which feature in the book about these marks I am physically sick and disgusted. It honestly saddens me. I wonder how such a thing passed by so many ARC readers though. The cover itself is a representation of self harm. Something that people also need to be aware of. It is not simply a wall with gold paint. Please proceed with caution if you choose to read this book despite the triggers present. Stay safe. As soon as you feel even slightly triggered, put the book down. Your mental health and physical well being is more important than this story. Please be careful, you're all too important.On top of all this, there are racist stereotypes and ableist attitudes all throughout this book. Something which shouldn't be supported at all, in my opinion. Also, to tell people their opinion about the racism, ableism and triggers which feature in this book is invalid or wrong is highly ignorant behaviour . You are allowed to enjoy this book, but stay away of the problems that do feature and stay open to others opinions, especially those who have been harmed by this novel.For more information on the ableism, which is primarily about chronic pain because described as a gift, read Emer's review.

You and I, we've become what we were made to become.\"\nI feel like I could throw a dart in a bookstore and hit at least a dozen YA books with practically the same quote and premise. The nature vs nurture debate is well-trodden ground in fiction, not just in YA. Is there such thing as fate? Are villains born or made? These are all themes that can be reinvigorated and made fresh and unique, but Carve The Mark just fails across the board.I'm the first to admit Divergent had its problems. But at least it was fun, fast-paced, and filled a Harry Potter and the Hunger Games niche. Carve The Mark is boring. Lifeless. Take them out of space and it'd be a more standard dystopian than its comparison title Divergent. And it ends abruptly just when things are getting exciting, as though it knows it needs something to bring readers back.There's absolutely nothing noteworthy about the main characters Cyra and Akos. They're just there, taking up space, saying their lines, running through the motions. It's a mark of how utterly blah they are that their banter falls flat. Not a single crooked grin graced my mouth while reading.The romance is formulaic and didn't carry as much depth as it should have. Akos was captured by Cyra's people (the Shotet) as a child. Her brother ordered the murder of his father and brother. He is a prisoner falling in love with his captor, but he spends a weirdly short amount of time analyzing this.Where's the self-loathing? I can't believe I'm asking this, but where's the angst? He accepts his feelings far too easily for someone in his position. I personally think Ryzek, Cyra's power-hungry brother, is a far more interesting character to focus on because his currentgift allows him to swap out his own memories for someone else's. It explores the question of how much your past defines your personality. The person usually on the receiving end of these memory swaps is Akos's brother Elijah. Unfortunately, Roth insists on shining the spotlight on the boring siblings. Finally, the chronic pain/self-harm glorification:\n\"The gift,\" I said, \"is the strength the curse has given me.\" The new answer was a blooming hushflower, petals unfurling. \"I can bear it. I can bear pain. I can bear anything.\"\nFor the record, the title refers to a Shotet practice where lines are carved on their arm to mark their kills. Pain is a main theme in Carve the Mark and is ultimately presented as something positive, something that helps you build character. There has been considerable outrage over this, which you can Google. While I agree that this message has some uncomfortable implications, I sort of understand why Roth wrote it the way she did. Her religious beliefs, I personally think, shape the way she writes. It's why she ended Allegiant the way she did. (Please note that this is pure speculation and I could be as wrong as BBC Sherlock fans who thought Mary Watson was working for Moriarty. But the English major in me won't shut up.)Overall, I expected more. More from YA, more from an author who has an international bestseller and a film franchise under her belt. I won't be waiting for the sequel with baited breath."}, {"userName": "AleJandra", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25897549-alejandra", "userReview": "[En una galaxia muy muy muy lejana, existen 9 planetas conectados por una fuerza espiritual y f\u00edsica llama courrent, es posible verlo en el espacio, tambi\u00e9n puede ser puesta en cosas como armas, pero principalmente vive en cada persona y los hace desarrollar un poder especial.
