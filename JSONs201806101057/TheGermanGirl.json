This is the most involved in a historical fiction novel I have ever been. The first sentence gripped me and I found myself clenched throughout the entire read. The most moving factor for me was the complete list at the end of the book that stated the names of all the passengers on board the St. Louis. I found myself choking back tears while reading the horrible history described in the author's note; reflection on such torture seemed not important enough an action to take, yet it's all we can do. I'm hoping books such as this one can help us remember the injustices done in our world history as to not repeat them again. Highly recommended to fans of WWII historical fiction; this stated it was recommended to fans of The Nightingale which makes me eager to pick it up and read it as well. *Thanks to Goodreads Giveaway for providing my copy in exchange for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-jen", "userReview": "A life of pain and suffering. Of loss.Told in parallel stories with decades between them, this story spans from 1939 to 2014 and is the story of Hannah and Anna.Both lost a parent due to war - one during the holocaust; the other to 9-11. Anna is the namesake of Hannah- a great aunt who immigrated to Cuba from Nazi invaded Germany. The stories draw out the journeys each girl makes. Hannah's is the focus from Germany to Cuba on a ship that poses it's own challenges for the 'impure'. Just when escape was almost a victory, only 36 of 942 passengers were able to disembark. The irony. The bitterness. The bleakness. I had no idea of Cuba's role and the exile The Jews faced from countries abroad trying to escape the land that was once home. The countries that denied them asylum in addition to Cuba were Canada and the U.S. 4**** for this one. I agree with other reviews that the ending was a touch over the top, but overall a well written and memorable read. The reproduction of the passenger list with accompanying photos were a beautiful tribute."}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "3.5 rounded up I have read a good number of holocaust stories and I'm always amazed how much there is to learn, and as I always say when reviewing these books, it is so very important, no not just important, but imperative that we remember. This is a heartbreaking story about an incident that occurred in 1939 that only some may know about and that is precisely why this book is one that should be read. In 1939 over 900 German Jews fled on the ship the Saint Louis leaving Germany for asylum to Cuba , many of them with plans to further move to the United States. The shockingly awful refusal by Cuba and the US to accept these people is told though one of the alternating narratives of two twelve year old girls, one in Berlin in 1939 and one in New York in 2014. Hannah from a well to do family must leave her comfortable home but is accepting of it since she is leaving with her loving parents and her friend Leo. But the situation turns and only 28 people are allowed to embark in Cuba and while Hannah and her mother are among them, her father, Leo and his father are not . Anna, living in New York with her mother in 2014, thinks her father has disappeared and but then it becomes painfully clear to her that he died on that day in September and to the reader as her school commemorates those lost on 9/11. She's never met her father. An envelope arrives from Cuba with negatives to be developed, a German magazine with a cover photo of a young girl who looks like Anna- a mystery to be pieced together with these things sent from Hannah, a woman who says she is the aunt who raised Anna's missing father. A link between these two who have both lost fathers becomes a bond of hope. This is a heartbreaking story which felt somewhat simplistic in the writing ; it is understandable since the bulk of the narratives are from the perspective of two young girls . It's a little light on the treatment of the holocaust and I would have thought that this should have been described as geared to a YA audience. Yet it is impactful. It's about horrific things that happened to people, represented by these two voices and about the resilience of the human spirit.

The saddest part of this book for me was the real history \u2014- history that the United States - Cuba - and Canada - should have felt ashamed of \u2014 for their loathness and aversion in accepting and welcoming Jewish refugees. The President of Canada and the United States - both refused their entrance. When the St. Louis sailed from Germany to Cuba with over 900 people - Germans and Jews - hopeful to begin a new life \u2014 one could only imagine the horrific devastation the people felt being turned away. Less than 50 people were granted sanctuary. The storytelling narrated by Anna and Hannah - both 12 years old - time switching back and forth - 1939 Berlin/ 2014 Manhattan- lacked texture -range of moods and intensity - ....it was like a steady line of despondency from start to finish. I often found it wearisome switching back and forth with the chapters and the characters. It became somewhat irritating and predictable- never changing styles in the crafting ....it just got tedious for me. In concluding the actual history was shattering...but the delivery- storytelling through Anna and Hannah was mundane. Many readers thought this was a beautiful book. I respect our differences. I didn\u2019t hate it. It was \u2018ok\u2019 for me.

Her days are spent running around with her friend Leo, two eleven year olds that are trying to find understand what is happening to their country, find out their parents plan. They will leave on a ship to Cuba, the St, Louis. Anna, and her mother will receive a packet in the mail, pictures of her Aunt Hannah, a look into her Father's past. Her father who never knew she had been born and this is the opportunity to find out about her Father's life. In present time, she and her mother will travel to Cuba to meet Hannah and find out about the father she never knew.Such a good read, the scenes in Berlin and on the St, Louis are so vivid, so heartfelt, wonderfully told. Hannah and Leo are amazing characters, memorable, heartbreaking. Life in Cuba where very few passengers are allowed to disembark, never feels like home for Hannah and her mother. The heat, the customs, their losses, what this country took from them. Later we will get a glimpse of the Cuban revolution, another event that will turn on its own country's people, another event that will effect this small family. The ending was a little too sentimental in my view, but I am not sure how else it could have ended. The best written parts were Hannah and Leo's story, this part is unforgettable.I have come to the conclusion that I can continually read books about Hitler and his terrible programs and still find out new and cruel things, never ending. I applaud the author for bringing another little know event, the fate of the Jews on the St. Louis, into the public's eye.

Formerly among Berlin\u2019s uppermost of society, their family was no longer welcome, they are seen as the \u201cunclean.\u201d Scorned. Hannah, an eleven-year old girl, was used to a life wrapped in loveliness. Hannah\u2019s only solace is now found with her friend Leo. Together, they must find a future together. Leaving Germany seemed difficult at first, to leave behind the life they once loved, but it\u2019s no longer that life. The one chance they have is a ship, the Saint Louis. They need to get all their papers signed, all the arrangements made, and then they will, hopefully, be able to join the other families going to Cuba. It is the only place to go. No other country will allow them to come. No one else wants them. Visas in hand the Rosenthals and Leo\u2019s family, the Martins, leave their home, their life, everything, for Havana. The gloom of the last days of their life in Berlin, for them, begins to lift a little as the ship begins the journey. Hannah and Leo enjoy many days of hope, and their playful nature fills their days. Their coming-of-age story is sweet, and then fraught with the potential for loss. Little by little, news filters in. There will be no admittance to Cuba for most of these 937 passengers. Hannah\u2019s father spends days with the ship\u2019s Captain in deep conversation, trying to find solutions. Neither the US or Canada will admit them, their only chance is Cuba, there, at least, their papers are in order. Or were, before Cuba decided to add on a new condition impossible to fill after their departure. Decades have passed, it\u2019s Anna Rosen\u2019s eleventh birthday. She receives an envelope from a great Aunt she\u2019s never met, the woman who raised her father. Anna\u2019s mother has rarely spoken of her father, never of his death. Hannah is intrigued by this news. Finding a relative of this father she never knew, a woman she now knows she was named after. She\u2019s desperate to meet her, to find out more, Hannah will soon be eighty-seven years old; there is no time to waste. Loosely based on the 1939 journey of the Saint Louis, the fictional lives of some of the 28 allowed to disembark in Cuba, and the lives of the others who left Germany on this ship only to be turned away by Cuba, a disaster averted by those few who were allowed to remain in Cuba, and the disaster of the lives for those who were turned away. Alternately told through the stories of Hannah and Anna, their journeys and their joys, heartbreaks and happiness. There\u2019s plenty of tragedy in Hannah\u2019s half of the story alone, but add the tragedy of Anna\u2019s father\u2019s death into the mixture, and it sounds as though it would be an overwrought, depressing story. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s often dismal, but there is also joy that finds its way through. An unforgettable debut novel.

The dual timelines successfully meld to bring the past and future together. Set in Germany, Cuba and New York this book describes the sense of loss of displacement and isolation from a country that no longer sees you as desirable into another country that never feels like you belong. The sense of loss permeates through the generations where only memories and promises remain. The ending is beautifully bittersweet and also tear inducing but I couldn\u2019t think of a better finale."}, {"userName": "abby", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44478099-abby", "userReview": "When eleven-year-old Hannah Rosenthal winds up on the cover of the German Girl, a Nazi propaganda magazine for pre-teen girls, it's almost a sick joke. Because if her childhood in Berlin living amongst the \"Ogres\" has taught her anything it's that she's not German-- not pure, not wanted, barely tolerated. Her blonde hair and blue eyes can do nothing to change that. By 1939, her family is more or less holed up in their apartment building, the one that's been in her mother's family for decades but that the Ogres now want for themselves. The Rosenthal family's tenants used to respect them, but now they ask \"Why won't they just leave?\" (the building they own! the country of their birth!) \"Why are they still here? Don't they know how uncomfortable this situation is making us?\"And Hannah's family does leave, because as Jews they don't really have any other options. The Ogres arrest Hannah's father, only allowing the family to leave the country if they turn over all their assets. But it's worth it for the chance to escape to Cuba, where they will go on to America. Along with 900 other Jewish passengers, including Hannah's best friend, Leo Martin, the Rosenthals set sail on the MS St. Louis bound for Havana. In one final insult, all the passengers are forced to buy return tickets, even though everyone knows this is a one way trip.For two weeks, they're human beings again. Their captain, a German but not an Ogre, makes sure that his passengers were treated with respect. There is fine dining, dancing, and swimming. It's almost a dream vacation.It ends in a nightmare. Unknown to the passengers aboard, the Cuban government had retroactively invalidated almost everyone's visas. Hannah and her pregnant mother are allowed to disembark, but her father and Leo are still on ship as it is forced to sail away from salvation. But Cuba doesn't turn out to be a salvation for Hannah Rosenthal (now Ana Rosen), not really. Even though she lives to become an old woman, her life pretty much ended in 1939.The German Girl is told from two perspectives: Hannah and Anna, her only living relative. Hannah's story follows the events of 1939, from life in Berlin, where her only refuge is in her friend Leo, to the sailing of the St. Louis, to life in Cuba afterwards. Anna is her grand-niece. She comes to Cuba to meet with Hannah and learn about her father's past. Anna's father died before she was born on 9/11, and she barely knows anything about him. For Anna, this trip to Cuba is a chance to connect with her roots. For Hannah, it's a chance to close the book on the \"Rosen curse.\"The historical subject matter of this book is pretty fascinating, but I wasn't always riveted by the The German Girl. The writing is beautiful, but I don't read a book like this for the glamour. This book was slow for me to get through. I will say the ending was masterful (oh, Leo, break my heart, why don't you?). I don't know that I would have given this book 4 stars otherwise. Overall, this is a book that grows on you and gets better as it goes on.I don't feel like we get to know too much about Anna. Hannah definitely dominates this book, but even then we get a lot of \"I wish I had said\" and \"what I wanted to do was\" and not a lot of genuine action. Hannah gets stuck in her own head a lot.I loved the story of Hannah and Leo. I enjoyed the parallels between Nazi German and Communist Cuba. When the passengers boarded the St. Louis, crowds jeered and spit on them. Newspapers covered the event with the words: \"Good Riddance!\" The same exact thing happened to Cubans fleeing the island to America. The Nazis took Hannah's mother's apartment building; the Cuban state took her pharmacy. Their Cuban maid's nephew became an \"enemy of the state\" as a Jehovah's Witness and sent to a work camp, with a huge sign at the entrance that read: \"Work will make men of you.\"Sounds familiar, no?I recommend this book to fans of historical fiction, lovers of beautiful writing, and ww2 buffs. I also recommend learning about the real St. Louis and especially its hero captain Gustav Schroder.Thank you to the publisher and NetGalley for giving me a copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Amanda - Mrs B's Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16323644-amanda---mrs-b-s-book-reviews", "userReview": "*https://mrsbbookreviews.wordpress.comThe author of The German Girl, Armando Lucas Correa, was a recent guest at a writers festival held in Perth, Western Australia, where I live. Although I was unable to see Armando Lucas Correa, I highly endorse his novel, The German Girl. It is a fitting testament to another sad chapter to World War II\u2019s history and the Jewish people.The German Girl is a fictionalised account of the events that took place before, on board and after the German ship St Louis set sail in May, 1939. The St Louis departed from Hamburg, Germany and was bound on a voyage to Havana, Cuba. With more than nine hundred passengers on board, mainly German Jewish refugees, these people were hoping to escape the oppressive Nazi regime. Many were in search of freedom from persecution of the Third Reich in a new world, Havana. However, a tragic turn of events occurred and when the St Louis reached the waters of Havana, the ship was refused entry, unable to dock. While a selected few are allowed to disembark and enter Havana, the majority of the ship\u2019s occupants remained on board. The ship was forced to sail on, hoping to find sanction elsewhere but this is an impossible task. Correa chooses to zone his story into one girl, Hannah Rosenthal\u2019s personal experience aboard the St Louis. We follow Hannah and her family as they take a huge fall from grace. In the opening of the novel, the reader learns that the Rosenthals are a wealthy Jewish family. The increasing dominance of the Nazi regime and their hatred for the Jewish people forces this family to flee their home. This leads them to the fateful voyage on the St Louis. The family is torn apart by their decision to travel on the St Louis, a decision that echoes across the decades, impacting on the descendants of the Rosenthal family. We discover this through a package that is discovered by Hannah Rosenthal\u2019s grand-niece years later, which holds the key to the Rosenthal family\u2019s final fate.The German Girl is a touching and ambitious novel. It is expansive, crossing the continents, as the setting moves effortlessly from Europe, to Cuba and finally the US. It also spans time, covering an era of over seventy years. The German Girl employs the use of two young narrators to unfurl the main events of the story. Hannah Rosenthal is our narrator in the 1939 storyline and Anna, a twelve year old girl and direct descendant of Hannah\u2019s, living in New York in the present day takes on the other storyline. The two stories are separate but eventually they become intertwined, as the tale of the St Louis is revealed. I thought the package delivered in the present that kick starts Anna\u2019s search for the truth to her family\u2019s history was compelling. This signalled Anna\u2019s quest to develop a better understanding of her family\u2019s heritage, which leads her to take a trip to Cuba. This section of the story is emotional and tugs at the heartstrings, I also enjoyed the coming of age tale that emerged from Anna\u2019s journey.The historical thread surrounding Hannah Rosenthal and her family held slightly more interest for me than Anna, the young narrator\u2019s tale of events in the present. I am always on the hunt for stories to come of out of an era that fascinates me and Correa seemed to fill this void. Prior to reading The German Girl, I am ashamed to say I had not heard of the fate of the St Louis, so I am grateful to the author for raising my awareness to this shameful event in world history. Correa\u2019s level of research in this part of the novel is faultless and I admired his ability to turn a set of real historical events into a profound work of fiction. Correa certainly drew my attention to the fate of these refugees and perhaps a message could be taken away from this terrible event in the past, regarding our treatment of refugees seeking asylum in the present day. My final word on The German Girl are the detailed historical facts and the appendix which lists the passengers aboard the St Louis, contained at the back of the novel. These additions worked to deepen my respect for this novel.The German Girl is a moving piece of literature that serves to remind of us of the sorrowful incidents that occurred during the Holocaust. Armando Lucas Correa expertly ties together true life events, within an affective narrative. The German Girl is a novel that I imagine will stay with me and you for some time, long after the final page is turned."}, {"userName": "Susanne Strong", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne-strong", "userReview": "Beautiful, Haunting and Gut-wrenching. We cannot imagine the horror of those who experienced the atrocities of World War II. To read about them is extremely difficult and evokes such strong emotion. I, for one, can\u2019t imagine going through it. The German Girl is based on a true story of what happened during that time. Hannah Rosenthal is the German Girl. She is a twelve-year-old, blond hair, blue-eyed German Girl. And she is also a Jew. The year is 1939 and the place is Berlin. All Hell starts to break lose as Nazis invade Berlin and other parts of Germany and Europe. Some of their friends are taken in the night, never to return. Hannah\u2019s life as well as that of her best friend Leo, and their families are caught in the cross fire. They hide in their homes or slink around when they have to go out, hoping they don\u2019t get snagged. They fear for their lives and work to find a way out of Berlin. Eventually they obtain visas to travel on the St. Louis, a ship offering Jews safe passage to Cuba. The ship and the voyage is unlike anything they have ever experienced and they all believe their futures to be bright but upon arrival in Cuba they are told that the government has rescinded their offer and that passengers will no longer be allowed to disembark and will need to return to Europe. All hope is lost for Hannah and Leo, (who promised themselves to each other) as well as their families and everyone else on the ship. After tense negotiations, only 27 passengers are allowed to disembark, Hannah and her mother are two of them, leaving Hannah\u2019s father and Leo on the ship, to return to France, Great Britain and other parts of Europe, where there is little hope for their futures.Years later, in New York, Anna Rosen receives mail from Hannah Rosenthal, an Aunt she never knew she had. Anna\u2019s father, passed away on September 11th leaving no known family. The mail contains photographs to a history that Anna yearns to know about, including a photograph taken for a magazine of \u201cA German Girl.\u201d In analyzing the photographs, Anna and her mother search for Hannah and discover family they never knew they had and aide to help Hannah heal from the pain of the past and find peace.The German Girl is based on the true story of the St. Louis. It honors the lives lost in World War II. Armando Lucas Correa wrote such an incredibly beautiful story, and he told it with such sensitivity. The novel switches between the past and present day, with Hannah narrating her side of the story and the past up to the present day and Anna narrating her side of the story in the present day. Hannah and Anna are both such incredibly strong young women and both touch me in immeasurable ways. Though the novel was hard to read at times, it was incredibly well told, is a stunning book and I enjoyed it immensely. I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough and think it would be great for a book club read or those who enjoy true literature.

This book was my introduction to the SS St. Louis, a transatlantic liner offering Jews safe passage out of Germany in 1939. What I enjoyed most about this novel was learning about a piece of Holocaust history that I had known nothing about. It is obvious that a tremendous amount of research went into creating this novel. Overall, I thought the book was good, it just didn't have a \"wow\" factor for me. I kind of feel bad for this book because I think that part of my lack of enthusiasm boils down to a \"timing\" issue. I recently finished the novel \"Lilac Girls\" by Martha Hall Kelly which I absolutely love, love, loved! Like this book, \"Lilac Girls\" is a historical fiction novel based on true events. I think any novel, more specifically, any historical fiction novel that I read anytime soon will come up short compared to \"Lilac Girls\" - it was just THAT GOOD!One thing that lacked for me in this book was that I could not connect with any of the characters. It wasn't that I didn't like them, I just didn't connect with them. For a book to truly resonate with me, I have to feel that I have become immersed in the character's lives and storylines and I just didn't. This book couldn't keep my interest for long periods of time.Regardless of how I feel about the fictional characters in this novel, I really appreciate learning about this important piece of Holocaust history.

The story begins in Berlin in 1939 where we meet Hannah Rosenthal. A beautiful, spirited, blue eyed 12 old Jewish girl who likes nothing better than to spend time with her best friend Leo. Their friendship is an absolute delight to behold. they love to explore and roam the city but their World becomes significantly smaller as the Nazi's are closing in. Berlin no longer feels like home now the Ogres (Hannah and Leo's name for the Nazi's) are so ferociously horrible to them, their families and friends, telling what they can and can't do. Needless to say, due to the humiliating, degrading treatment, and Jewish families disappearing, Hannah's family have no choice but to flee and leave behind everything Hannah knows. There are few options to left to escape but the Rosenthals are quietly hopeful they may have found the answer. The family and Leo's family board the SS St.Louis, bound for Havana, at first all is exciting and even feels luxurious but after many months their home on the sea feels more like a Prison. When they eventually get to Havana, Hannah's mother Alma and Hannah are granted emigration devastatingly, Hannah's father is turned away.* Hannah and Alma, struggle living in Havana, it is nothing like their home from everything the climate to the political unrest. Decades later, we meet Anna Rosen who lives in New York City. Anna's whole life changes when her father died in the 9/11 attacks. Understandably, she wants to learn more about her father and who he was, her mother who has become increasingly depressed is of no help and refuses to talk about her father. On Anna's 11th birthday, she receives an envelope from her Great Aunt Hannah whom she has never met. She learns that her Great Aunt Hannah brought her father up and just maybe Anna can find the information she so desperately needs to know. After learning, that Hannah is now 87 Anna realises that there is no time to waste.Alternating between the two narratives, we see that through their tragedies, joys, memories and more that they may just find commonalities that they both long for. Of course, both Hannah and Anna have both seen the worst of mankind but along the way they have also found the true meaning of humanity.I highly recommend The German Girl, the writing of Correa is raw, emotional and powerful particularly when it comes to the Rosenthals in Berlin, on the St Louis and in Cuba. I want it to be clear that this book is not all depressing, there are purely joyful moments bringing a tear to my eye more than once. An extremely brave and sensitive topic to take on as a debut novel but I believe Correa has certainly done the topic justice with this historical fictional account.

Unfortunately, the Cuban's reneged on the promise only allowing in a measly 28 into Havana. The United States and Canadian governments also refused entry. The remaining passengers were forced back to Europe, where sadly most perished at the hands of the Nazi Regime."}, {"userName": "Kyoko SWords", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6094834-kyoko-swords", "userReview": "Lee la rese\u00f1a completa aqu\u00ed: http://sabiouswords.blogspot.com.co/2...4,5 y hace rato que un libro no me dejaba pensando por qu\u00e9 me gust\u00f3 tanto pero por qu\u00e9 no soy capaz de darle las 5 estrellas.

The story is told via two 12-year-old narrators in two different eras. One follows Hannah, a Jewish girl living in Berlin in 1939 and modern day Anna, a descendant of Hannah's, who lives in New York City.The first half of the book briefly introduces us to Anna but most of the page time is given to Hannah and her family's escape from Germany just before war breaks out. Living in Germany under the increasing power of what Hannah calls 'the Ogres' is hard. While Hannah has the unique experience of being a Jew yet looking more Aryan in complexion, this does not make her life easier and causes discord within her Jewish community. As Jews they are constantly denigrated by their neighbours and fear that their lives are in danger. This abuse, as well as the mood in Berlin at the time, is vividly portrayed to the reader. Surprisingly I didn't find myself invested in Hannah's (or Anna's) hardships. The setting and the plot were screaming for an emotional connection but it felt like Correa didn't delve deep enough into the emotions of his characters. Add in the very slowly paced plot and unfortunately I didn't feel like I had much of a connection to either of the girls whose personalities were so similar that they seemed to blend together. Personally, I would have preferred for Anna's story line to be omitted entirely with more focus on Hannah's family. After reading this book I questioned whether or not this is supposed to be a Historical Fiction for young teens instead of adults. The writing itself, while descriptive to a point, felt geared to a younger audience. It felt like the effects of this horrific war were toned down for the reader. If this book is written for a younger audience (and I could find no mention of it being specifically a YA read) I suppose it could be said that Correa was making his book age appropriate. Personally, if this is written for adults I don't think the devastation of WWII and the horror that was inflicted on Jews by the Nazis is something that should be glossed over. I also don't understand why, except for one instance I can recall, the author chose to not use the terms Jew, Nazi or Holocaust in his book.What I will take away from this novel is the fact that I enjoyed learning about the S.S St Louis, the trans-Atlantic ship that Hannah and her family took with almost 1,000 other people to Cuba to escape the horrors of war. I had previously no knowledge that there were refugees who escaped the Nazis only to be turned away by Cuba (who suddenly decided not to honour the visas that the passengers had procured earlier). ** Note: The US and Canada were also among the countries who also turned away these refugees. ** That was an aspect of WWII, in all of my reading, that I had no knowledge of and I'm grateful that I now know more about that aspect of the war.A plot focusing on the plight of Jewish refugees during WWII gave The German Girl all the makings of a unique, touching and wonderful WWII fiction read. Unfortunately, I don't think that Correa, an award winning journalist and author, delved deep enough into the issues or the emotions of his characters to make it a truly gripping and emotional read.Disclaimer: My sincere thanks to Atria Books and NetGalley for providing me with a complimentary e-book copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16285686-molly", "userReview": "I really liked this book. There are a lot of reasons I probably shouldn't have, but I enjoyed it anyway.It is the story of Hannah and Anna. Hannah: a 12-year-old Jewish girl in 1939 Germany. Anna: a 12-year-old girl from 2014 New York, grandniece of Hannah. Their stories are told forward and backward, revealing the relationship between the two of them.The main focus is on the real life transit of the ocean liner the St. Louis, taking 937 Jewish people from Germany to Havana, Cuba. Historical details from wartime Germany and later uprisings in Cuba are plentiful.It definitely had a YA feel - almost a Titanic/DeCaprio aura. And it was a bit difficult keeping Hannah and Anna separated. I can't say I fully connected with the characters.But somehow it worked for me. The weaving and connecting of the lives of these two ladies was fascinating. Their thoughts and fears were interesting to contrast. It was a serious book.As for not connecting with the characters \u2013 well, I guess I could understand Anna's 12-year-old feelings if I think way back. As for Hannah, as with so many others who suffered that war and the aftermath, I appreciate however they coped. Though slightly odd in tone, the German Girl was educational, beautiful, and haunting.

Give up and abandon hope :surrender.That's how I felt by then. I didn't believe in miracles.This had happened to us because we insisted on changing a destiny that was already written. We didn't have any rights, we couldn't reinvent history. We were condemned to be deceived from the moment we came into the world. Emotionally charged and intricately researched, The German Girl tells the story about a fictional German-Jewish family that hopes the S.S.

For the Rosen family, their lives are never to be the same again. Although I had learned from my Holocaust course the tremendously sad story of the St Louis, this book still left me gutted as Hannah recounts her story. The absolute happiness of the passengers who felt immense relief to be fleeing Nazi Germany and then the complete devastating news that fate has a twisted plan just makes a person want to scream. As the quotation above so eloquently states, the passengers quickly succumbed to feelings of being unwanted. A feeling that will seep its way into the very marrow of Hannah 's family for generations.Anna's (great niece of Hannah) story and the loss of her father in the 9/11 attacks were equally poignant. I appreciated how ALC makes both of our female protagonists connect over their mutual loss of family members. Hannah and Anna's time together is a truly beautiful part of the book. The German Girl is also illustrative of the grip that grief holds over those left behind with nothing but a memory or picture.While I found the added storyline of the revolution in Cuban and the parallels that play out for the Rosen family, I was still haunted by the passengers that were unable to get into Cuba. I NEED their stories to be told too! From a teacher standpoint, I feel that this book is appropriate for a HS reading audience.

This is a fictionalized account of an event that really happened.In the late 1930\u2019s the Nazi\u2019s had already invaded and controlled Berlin. This book is not so much a story of the horrors of the war or the Nazi\u2019s but more a telling of what happened to a family throughout many decades.We first meet Hannah Rosenthal who is a member of one of Berlin\u2019s prominent Jewish families. She has lived a happy life with many adventures shared with her best friend, Leo. When the Rosenthal\u2019s are finally stripped of their fine things and forced to surrender the apartment house that they own, their only recourse is to try and find a safe haven. They are a wealthy and influential family and their father secures passage on the St. Louis, a luxury liner, that will take them to Cuba where they have been promised a new life after buying papers from the government that they are told will grant them asylum in Havana. After a rather wonderful and exciting trip upon the St. Louis for Hannah and Leo they finally arrive in the port of Havana only to be told that their papers are no longer valid with the new government. Out of the 937 passengers only 28 are allowed into Havana. This included Hannah and her mother Alma but her father and Leo and his family are turned away.Next in the novel we are introduced to Anna Rosen, a young girl whose father has recently perished in the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers. Anna\u2019s mother has been extremely depressed and Anna is pretty much caring for herself and her mother when a letter appears one day from an aunt of her father, still living in Cuba. The letter also contains unprocessed photo film that will reveal people from her father\u2019s past. The correspondence and then further phone communication with the aunt acts to help her mother conquer her depression and try to find out about her husband\u2019s family and past life which he never confided to her. Her mother feels that Anna should be introduced to this aunt and they visit Cuba.There were many things that I loved about this book. First off the writing is wonderful, beautiful prose which flows at a steady and increasingly quicker pace. I had never known about the St.Louis and the Jews who tried to flee to Havana and this was a great insight into that event.Sadly, most of the people were turned away and ended up back in the Europe that they fled. The voices of the children, Hannah and Leo, were particularly well written. It is never a small feat for an author to get the thoughts and voices of children on paper. This friendship and all it encompassed was probably my favorite part of the book. The other characters from both the present and past are well described and touched me in many ways. The alternating chapters between Hannah and Anna are very cohesive and there was no disruption of the story process.I was left with some unanswered questions. I never fully understood why Hannah didn\u2019t flee Cuba after her mother died since she obviously hated living there, the people and the climate. Why were these particular 28 people chosen and the others turned away? Why didn\u2019t Hannah\u2019s family flee sooner when they had the funds and were well aware of what was happening, with friends and colleagues disappearing at alarming rates. Maybe there are no answers to these questions without being able to ask some of the real people who sailed on the St. Louis.I highly recommend this book to all lovers of historical fiction.

Germany had allowed them to leave with only ten German Marks each and a passage to Cuba, which would be a temporary stop before heading to the United States. When they arrived in Havana, the Cuban government asked for a $150 head tax. Only a few had made the arrangement prior to leaving Germany, and since most of them had little money, most were forced to head back to Europe on the ship. They were also denied safe haven in both Canada and the United States. The ship returned to Europe and most of the passengers died in either the war or concentration camps. Does this sound familiar today with the Syrian refugees? Also on the radio interview was Armando Lucas Correa talking about his book. I had to read this story.Although this is a book of fiction based on reality, Correa weaves together not just a simple tale of tragedy, but a real political aspect connects everything. Enter 12-year old Hannah Rosenthal, whose father, a pharmacist has raised the money for the voyage. Correa plays up the dark days leading up to the war, spelling out what it must have been like to be an outsider, but also how the Nazi's played off the people's fears and racism (does this ever sound like recent events - and the book was published before the November election?). But here is the catch. 12-year old Hannah has her photo plastered on the cover of the propaganda flyer, \"The German Girl.\" Hannah has blue eyes and blonde hair but also Jewish. At first it may have served her well but her father is not happy. The book has three main sections: life in Germany, the voyage, and Cuba. Now to make the book even more interesting, enter 12-year old Anna. Born in New York, she grows up without a father until one day her mother explains what happened. As I typically do, there is no spoiler here. What Correa does, sometime is amazing, sometimes trite but it held my attention right to the very end (and with a surprise). Both stories are told from the perspective of 12-year old girls. At first I wasn't sure about this but actually it worked for me - the weaving does intersect and the tale is told wonderfully.The message is very clear. We have to pay attention to the past to try avoid repeating it. And yet, sadly, just like in this tale history keeps repeating itself and humankind is its own worst nightmare.So looking for a great story that makes you think, try this book. And it is so very resonant today."}, {"userName": "In\u00e9s", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49073312-in-s", "userReview": "3'5 \u2b50 A pesar de narrar unos sucesos tan dram\u00e1ticos justo eso es lo que me ha faltado a m\u00ed,sentir ese drama. http://huellalibrosicc.blogspot.com.e..."}, {"userName": "Entre mis libros y yo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20314008-entre-mis-libros-y-yo", "userReview": "3,5 en realidad, me ha faltado un poco de tensi\u00f3n narrativa para alcanzar las 4 estrellas.

She's a rich girl, and her mother used to move in aristocratic circles and, when we meet her, she is in the depths of despair, on the brink of despondency because she cannot resign herself to her reduced social circumstances brought about by the fact that the Nazis are in power.The second twelve-year-old we meet is the great-niece of the first, and her mother is in the depths of despair because she is a 9/11 widow who never got to tell her husband that she was pregnant. She, too, is locked in her apartment being cared for by her minor daughter who has had to accept responsibility for a parent before her time.In the case of the first girl, Hannah, she wants to kill her parents, end it all, she can't take this attitude anymore. In the case of the second girl, why hasn't anyone called Social Services, for crying out loud??? How come she gets to find out that her father died on 9/11 during a memorial reading-of-the-names at school????The troubling thing is this: the mothers in this book are both spineless, manic depressive people who have clear bipolar tendencies. If they are not completely destroyed by a crisis, they are bouncing around with the peppiest, chirpiest, most enthusiastic will to forge ahead and live, live, LIVE!!!!!!!Hannah and her family escape Germany in a doomed ship. They are intended to travel to Cuba, where they will wait until they can leave for the US, and -while they are in transit- events make this impossible; Cuba doesn't want these Jewish refugees, and neither do the States nor Canada. Hannah's father, who had been arrested and held prisoner before their exit from Germany, has become a shell of his former self; he barely talks, except to the Captain and another passenger (Hannah's boyfriend's father), and agonizes about their future. He basically knows they're doomed from the get-go, but since his wife is happy (and -surprisingly- suddenly pregnant) he just plods along with whatever is necessary.Hannah's mother doesn't want to go to Cuba anyway; she hates Cuba, Cubans, Cuban culture... When she and Hannah have to get off the boat (two among the lucky very few who do), she does so reluctantly, haughtily, angrily, and full of the worst bile against Cuba, Cubans and Cuban culture. Hannah's father goes off into the sunset in the doomed ship, sent -like many others- to France (doomed, of course, because we all know what happened to Jews in France during the war). Hannah and her mother settle down in Cuba, but Hannah's mother finds the resources to go to NY to have her baby, hating Cuba, Cubans, and Cuban culture every single second of their lives. Hannah's mother hates Cuba, Cubans, and Cuban culture so much that she wants to die there, be buried there, and for Hannah to do the same regardless of how long she lives.Anna, Hannah's great-niece, travels from NY to Cuba to meet her aunt. Her mother, after a sudden and almost fatal health crisis, is enthusiastic about this because they will get to learn about her dead husband...who, apparently, is remembered as being the kind of guy who likes going to the movies, but didn't really tell her much else while they were married. She knew he had a trust fund, a nice apartment, and belonged to a club where he got a haircut once a month, but that's about the gist of it...Anna and Hannah share the despondent mothers, the exhilarating and not-of-their-class boyfriends, and a liking for photography. Hopefully, and I say this with very little faith that out there in fiction world this will develop, Anna will break out of the despondency that seems to permeate this family's character. They are attracted to doom; they \"let themselves die\"... Hannah never did much with her life; she took care of her mother (who was just dripping with bile and anger against Cuba, Cubans, and Cuban culture for her entire living days), her brother (was he the product of a liaison with a Nazi official who greased the wheels of emigration for Hannah's family????), and her nephew (Anna's father) who all basically were depressed, colorless people who beat their heads against the thick wall of destiny only to succumb to it...I am guessing Mr. Correa's intentions were pure, and he had a good story to tell, but having two twelve-year-olds narrate a story from their perspectives is one thing and having an 87-year-old still narrate like a twelve-year-old is another. None of the main characters in this story are likable; not a single solitary one. Not Hannah, not Alma (her mother...her bitter, angry, vindictive, arrogant mother), not Hannah's father, not Anna's mother (who has let herself be cared for by her daughter because, apparently, the only person who suffered massive loss on 9/11 was HER,) not Hannah's brother, or Anna's father for that matter. The minor characters are somewhat better, but...they're all caricatures: the nannies all have ample bosoms, loving hearts, maternal instincts. The boyfriends are all absolutely sure of the future they want with the girl they love at the tender age of twelve. And all these people, by the way, come across as doomed...The words Jewish or Jew never come up. Hannah is completely and utterly disconnected from her heritage, her faith, her culture...because the Nazis treat them as undesirables, they decide that, hey, just let it go. Hannah lives in Havana for decades before she even happens to walk past the synagogue...this is such a traumatic event that she never again EVER walks down that street.Sigh...Wasted opportunity. A deluge of words that doesn't do more than introduce us superficially to these people we're supposed to be invested in... As I told my husband last night, after carefully closing the book and putting it back on the shelf to prevent myself from throwing it across the room, this is as frustrating as James Cameron's Titanic...so many compelling, heartbreaking, factual stories about passengers on a doomed ship, and the author chooses to make up this narrative quagmire that, quite honestly, leaves you feeling like you need a shower after every scene in which Hannah's mother is described...I hope someday, somewhere, someone does justice to the passengers of the St. Louis, and to the many Jewish refugees who were turned away from safety. People can wax poetic about this book, but...it's depressing, and not one bit life-affirming."}], "description": "A stunningly ambitious and beautiful debut novel, perfect for fans of Sarah\u2019s Key and All the Light We Cannot See, the story of a twelve-year-old girl\u2019s harrowing experience fleeing Nazi-occupied Germany with her family and best friend, only to discover that the overseas asylum they had been promised is an illusion.In 1939 before everything changed, Hannah Rosenthal lived a charmed life. Her family moved in Berlin\u2019s highest social circles, admired by friends and neighbors. Eleven-year-old Hannah was often taken by her mother for an afternoon treat at the tea room of the beautiful Adlon Hotel, both dressed in their finest clothes. She spent her afternoons at the park with her best friend Leo Martin. But, in an instant, that sunlit world vanished. Now the streets of Berlin are draped with red, white, and black flags; their fine possessions are hauled away, and they are no longer welcome in the places that once felt like home. The two friends make a pact: come what may, they promise to have a future together.As Hannah and Leo\u2019s families desperately begin to search for a means of escape, a glimmer of hope appears when they discover the Saint Louis, a transatlantic liner that can give Jews safe passage to Cuba. After a frantic search to obtain visas, the Rosenthals and the Martins depart from Hamburg on the luxurious passenger liner bound for Havana. Life aboard the ship is a welcome respite from the gloom of Berlin\u2014filled with masquerade balls, dancing, and exquisite meals every night.As the passengers gain renewed hope for a bright future ahead, love between Hannah and Leo blossoms. But soon reports from the outside world began to filter in, and dark news overshadows the celebratory atmosphere on the ship; the governments of Cuba, the United States, and Canada are denying the passengers of the St. Louis admittance to their countries, forcing them to return to Europe as it descends into the Second World War. The ship that had seemed their salvation seems likely to become their death sentence.After four days anchored at bay, only a handful of passengers are allowed to disembark onto Cuban soil, and Hannah and Leo must face the grim reality that they could be torn apart. Their future is unknown, and their only choice will have an impact in generations to come.Decades later in New York City on her eleventh birthday, Anna Rosen receives a mysterious envelope from Hannah, a great-aunt she has never met but who raised her deceased father. In an attempt to piece together her father\u2019s mysterious past, Anna and her mother travel to Havana to meet Hannah, who is turning eighty-seven years old. Hannah reveals old family ties, recounts her journey aboard the Saint Louis and, for the first time, reveals what happened to her father and Leo. Bringing together the pain of the past with the mysteries of the present, Hannah gives young Anna a sense of their shared histories, forever intertwining their lives, honoring those they loved and cruelly lost.", "title": "The German Girl", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29430755-the-german-girl", "average": 3.81, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1476615841l/29430755.jpg", "reviews": 1548, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3187865.Armando_Lucas_Correa", "name": "Armando Lucas Correa"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "War", "World War II"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29430755-the-german-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31550413-the-german-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34383053-la-ni-a-alemana", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38618338-a-rapariga-alem", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32673465-la-ni-a-alemana", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32943283-la-ni-a-alemana", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7195970-en-busca-de-emma"]}
