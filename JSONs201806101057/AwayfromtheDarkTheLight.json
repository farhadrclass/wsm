Ever since reading 'Consequences', I one-click anything she writes. She's never let me down. Her books always mess with my mind and tear me up inside in the best possible way. She has a way of making me question all of the things that I thought I knew, obliterating any clear sense of right and wrong. She makes me explore those gray areas, where things aren't always clear-cut.While 'Into the Light' was full of questions and mystery, 'Away from the Dark' is full of answers. The pieces of the puzzle slowly piece themselves together, providing a comprehensive view of \"The Light\". However, some truths are more terrifying than the lies.As Sara's memories come back to her, she is faced with the grim reality of her situation. She is fully aware of the evil that surrounds her, but powerless to stop it. Trying to save herself only lands her in greater danger, forcing her to rely upon the very man that she's trying to escape.Regardless of the situation, Sara fell in love with Jacob. After his true identity is revealed to Sara, they both struggle to come to terms with what that means for them. Can you really love an illusion? Does the end justify the means? Both Sara and Jacob do a lot of soul-searching in this book.Admittedly, the book started a little slow for me. It went back in time a little to provide a more complete description of the events leading up to Sara's escape at the end of the first book. While that information was critical, it killed me to be moving back in time versus forward. I was dying to know how everything would work out and patience isn't a strength of mine.That being said, once things started to move forward, I could not put it down. I literally fell asleep with my iPad on my chest and woke up in the middle of the night when it fell over and smacked me in the face, nearly breaking my nose! It is one of those books.There were some twists and turns along the way. The suspense was incredible. Even the revelation of things that were known to readers at the end of the first book, seemed shocking - again - as Sara discovers them for the first time. I could feel the betrayal and heartache as if they were tangible.As is the norm for Ms. Romig, the characters and storyline are extremely well-developed. The plot was complex and brilliant. The ending gave me chills.If you love a story that is a little dark and full of suspense, this is a fantastic choice. I won't give it away, but it is sooo worth it. I absolutely loved this unique story."}, {"userName": "SueBee\u2605bring me an alpha!\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15735368-suebee-bring-me-an-alpha", "userReview": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u00bd!

This being book 2, you are either just now hearing about this addicting series and need to immediately rush out and grab Into the Light, or you\u2019ve read book #1 and are about to start/just finished Away from the Dark (yay! that\u2019s this book!). Either way, you\u2019re in for a treat, and I can\u2019t stress enough how fantastic this series is. While I originally thought this was just going to be a duology, I\u2019m now wondering if she left this the way it is with the intent of coming back to it at a later date? I wouldn\u2019t call it a cliffhanger; just an open ending, but more on that later.This book picks up directly where Into the Light left off, and even though you wouldn\u2019t want to, (because book #1 was fantastic and you\u2019d be missing loads of details that make these books as good as they are) you could almost pick this one up and be filled in on all the major happenings of book #1. The first 35-40% of the book is setting up \u201cthe grand finale\u201d and convincing Sara to \u201cextinguish The Light\u201d. I know, VAGUE VAGUE VAGUE but it\u2019s for your own good. If you read book #1 you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019ll admit, the pacing was a little slower to begin with in this book, but once it took off I couldn\u2019t put it down. I just love the characters in these books; even though at times it\u2019s cheesy and unrealistic, I can\u2019t help but get sucked into their world and become attached. I LOVE CULT THEMED BOOKS. Call me twisted, but it has always fascinated me, especially due to my inquisitive mind always trying to pin point how a few humans can convince a group to follow their mentality. There has been some fantastic cult-related fiction released in 2016, but these books take the cake. The romantic aspect is a huge draw as well, as its not overly mushy or erotic, which just adds to the plot instead of distracting from the action.I\u2019ll admit that the ending went in a completely different direction than I expected, which is always a good thing! Two separate characters who I felt were just minor and necessary for specific motivations turned out to be major characters who I\u2019d like to see come back and continue the story (come on Aleatha!!! Don\u2019t leave us hanging!) Again, for those who are thinking \u201cI don\u2019t want to start another series that will just leave me unsatisfied and hanging in the end\u201d; don\u2019t. I can\u2019t go into detail but it\u2019s not that kind of ending. There was closure on multiple levels, and the ending could be left alone perfectly fine if she chooses. This was just an ending that left the option of coming back in the future. Clearly you can tell which side of the fence I fall on, but I will respect her wishes if she so chooses to never touch these characters again. *sniff sniff* Highly recommended to cult fiction and thriller fanatics; this one isn\u2019t just marketed to ladies! I know many of my Goodreads buddies have read both already, and the reviews are turning out to be just as fabulous for this one as they were for the first. Well done, and I\u2019ll be looking for more from author Aleatha Romig.*I received my copy from the publisher via InkSlinger PR in exchange for a review on the Away From the Dark blog tour.

After I finished Into the Light earlier this year, I was blown away and so ready for the sequel. When this hit my kindle, I dove in, ready to see what was going to happen with Sara. A huge bomb was dropped and I had to see how it was going to turn out. I have to say, I love the direction Aleatha took with this story. There were so many parts that left me a nervous wreck, just waiting to see what would happen. I couldn't tell how this would turn out, but it was a page turner till the very end. In the first book, we got the povs of Sara, Stella and Jacob. I loved seeing how everything tied together. How certain people were involved\u2026 By the end of this book I was in awe of how everything connected. I am really hoping that this series is continued. I know Sara and Jacob\u2019s story concluded, but there are loose ends and things that I need to know. I would be thrilled if another book was written.

What did it mean? Did the book really end like that?!OH. MY. GOD! This book was crazily amazing. AMAZING!!! It made me feel various emotions. I was happy that Jacob and Sara were together, but at the same time, worried about their decision. I was so scared of what might happen to them if things went wrong. When they were in dangerous situations, I felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. But most of all, I was very angry with the bad guys and all the things they did to innocent people. And when I finished reading this book, the epilogue left me stunned, utterly speechless. I can wholeheartedly say that Away from the Dark is hands down one of my most memorable reading experiences. While the first book was a bit predictable, this one was totally different. The plot was way beyond anything I could possibly imagine. Almost everything that happened in this book was unforeseeable. There were many unexpected twists and turns I never saw coming! To be honest, while reading this, I didn't even dare to guess what would happen in the next page. I admired both Jacob and Sara for their determination, their bravery, and their strength. No matter what the outcome was, I think they did the best they could under the circumstances. And by the end, after all they had been through, I was truly happy for them that they eventually had their HEA. But that epilogue!

A lot of heightened emotions and suspense, you never know what is going to happen next or what new truth will be revealed. This was a much faster paced read, completely sucked me into the mystery of it all. This is the second and final installment of The Light duet, which is told from multiple POV, making it easier to process all the information coming at you. I'm so happy Jacob and Sara's story didn't get lost in the fold, in my eyes it only made them stronger. I loved how their relationship wasn't immature, they managed to make choice decisions with little to no added drama. It's a sick and twisted world they live in, where the desire for simplicity and security is exploited by greed and power. Honestly it wouldn't be right to divulge anymore, this is just something you have to jump into and let the story take you away. While the story may have ended, I don't think this is the last we will see of the shadows, it's just too big to keep in the dark. Hope you take a chance and enjoy this something new.

With the realization of her true identity, Sara/Stella is attempting to flee The Light. She seeks out the help of an outsider, Thomas, and puts herself in danger. With Jacob\u2019s help, she is rescued just in time. Once reunited, Jacob reveals his true identity to Stella. He gives her two choices: enter into witness protection or stay with him and help him bring down the light. Stella chooses the latter, but what she and Jacob are unaware of is that they are both in imminent danger. After being summoned by Father Gabriel, Jacob and Stella travel out of the Northern Light to go to the Eastern Light. Father Gabriel separates the two, and has some scary plans for Stella. Once again, Stella is saved, but this time it\u2019s not Jacob who rescues her, but her former boyfriend, Dylan, who turns out to be crazier than Father Gabriel. Jacob and Stella now must fight to not only stay alive, but also to find their way back to one another.Like Into the Light, Away from the Dark is packed with non-stop action, twists and turns, and romance.

Sara\u2019s husband, Jacob, holds an esteemed position as an Assemblyman and has tried to teach her doctrine, but Jacob has kept his own secret and now his hand is forced in an effort to protect his wife.\n \u201cEverything was wrong. I was surrounded by lies. How had it happened? Why had it happened? Who had done this to me?\u201d \nAs Sara\u2019s memories become stronger, the truth is undeniable and falling back on her inquisitive nature, she decides to sacrifice her own fears to expose the reality of The Light. However, Sara must also reconcile her past and present to understand how choices will affect her future with Jacob.\n \u201cYou can hate me for the rest of your life. Just, please, trust me for a few more hours. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid the rest of your life won\u2019t be long.\u201d \nThe pacing in this book is intense and the tension mounts from the beginning. Adding to the sense of foreboding are the varying POVs and chapter order that zig zag creating more questions for the reader. The range of character personalities are complimentary and contribute to the furtherance of this mysterious plot. There is no doubt as to who the villain is but his motives and associates become shadowy leading to some worthy book shouting moments. \n \u201cThe Light is here and there and everywhere. There\u2019s no escaping it.\u201d \nAleatha Romig\u2019s brand of story telling always leads the reader down a path that includes layers of twists and revelations and that signature is present in this book. At every turn, each character\u2019s plight evokes strong emotions. With the larger than life presence of The Light, the cult culture becomes it\u2019s own character by adding the elements of fear and empathy that underscore the need to expose such inequalities and illegalities. This series was entertaining and had me turning page after page in practically one sitting. Jacob was a stand out character for me and Sara proved her strength in spades. In resolving the plot conflicts, most questions were answered but I was personally hoping for a different ending for a certain character. Overall, if you are looking for a thrilling romantic suspense, you will not be disappointed!

We learn much more about the inner workings of The Light as Jacob and Sara try to navigate their way out of potentially dangerous situations. There are so many plot twists and revelations it was hard to find stopping points. Whatever I thought I knew and understood about cult organizations was severely challenged and tested. Even though mind altering substances were used to initially control many of the women, it was still the conditioning that remained and kept them under control long after the drug use ceased. It was psychologically fascinating and it made me wonder how I would have fared. This was an excellent two-book series, though the epilogue suggests the story hasn't ended. I hope not as this was a very interesting subject matter with much more that could be explored. For those who like to read out of order...don't. You'll be utterly confused so do yourself a favor and start with the first book. I liked how things ended for Jacob and Sara but am intrigued about the future possibilities.

It's hard to review this because of spoilers and it's best to know as little as possible before starting.I don't typically seek out mysteries or thrillers unless there is a paranormal aspect, but in this case, I made an exception, and it was well worth it! Both books completely hooked me. While perhaps not a perfect series (I can't say I was overly shocked at how events unfolded), the writing kept me going from the beginning. It's very easy to read and keeps your attention.The romance was a bit weird for me, and I would say it's a bit dark. Jacob had reasons for doing what he did, but it was still hard at first to \"ship\" them. But, I was able to deal with it and move on.

Thank you the author, Aleatha Romig, and the publisher, Thomas and Mercer, for this opportunity. This is the second instalment in the Light duology. Sara Adams has been an unwilling follower of the cult, the Light, for close to a year. With the sudden return of the memories from her former life, she starts to understand the corrupt and sexist organisation she has unwittingly been a part of. With the return of her awareness comes her wish for freedom. But how will she escape the seemingly irrepressible institution.Just like the first instalment, the suspense is what drives the momentum of the plot forward. The narrative is constructed in such a way that you, as the reader, continually question what is real and what is right. The focus on the cult further muddies the waters of what is deemed 'right' and 'wrong'. Throughout my reading of the first book I could not acknowledge how any part of the Light could be good, but this second book has me second-guessing that. The brainwashing and indoctrination the female followers undergo is horrific, as is the sexist notions on how they are to behave. Reading of this was not pleasant or easy. And yet, hearing of the equally as horrific lives some of these females previously led made me wonder: which of their lives was worse? Drug-addicts, prostitutes and the homeless were among the forgotten women re-homed by the Light, and many of these came willingly. The Light can in no way be deemed as a positive institute, but Romig made us question, and question again, everything we thought we knew and how the good/bad binaries are not so easy to define.The one facet of this I could not forgive or forget, occurred about a third of the way through. Sara's husband, Jacob, reacts horrifically to her re-found freedom. His actions at this time are explained and forgiven by Sara, but not by me. I could not look past the version of himself that emerged and it made it hard for me to visualise or accept him as the hero or love interest of the plot. Again, I believe Romig carefully created such scenes to make the reader question everything about this world, not so far removed from our own. But this question I could never fully comprehend. I would not say she in any way romanticised abuse, but this scene made me wary about trusting the character that could react in such a way, no matter the motive or the feelings his actions conjured inside of himself.I did not allow this to fully impact my enjoyment of the book, as I believe Romig had no dark motive. My interpretation of this also seems not to be shared by other readers. However, this soured my own experience of the duology, somewhat."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10367112-michelle", "userReview": "ARC provided by author/publisher in exchange for an hones review\nA sexy, suspenseful, and hypnotic blend of Aleatha Romig\u2019s signature stamp of the unexpected.

Three days later, and my mind is completely frazzled by the complex story Aleatha Romig crafted for her readers. My one question- where does she come up with this stuff? It's refrshingly EPIC!Away from the Dark is the second installment in a two-part series (that I firmly suspect has more story to be told after the epilogue). But I digress...Away from the Dark picks up right on the heels of Into the Light. Stella, an investigative reporter who asked one too many questions, peered into one too many dark shadows- finds herself named Sara, married to a member of The Light (religious cult), and all her previous life memories had been erased courtesy of an amnesia drug she'd been inadvertently taking. Starting 'fresh' with no memory, Sara is gradually brainwashed trained to the ways of The Light, their doctrines, lifestyle, expectations for her as a member and as a wife to Brother Jacob. Not knowing what she doesn't know, Sara gradually falls into the life of a sister for The Light, even falls for her husband Jacob in all his protective ways. \nOnly when she stops taking her 'birth control pills' do her memories start to recover. Her past collides with her present and everything she's lived the past year is a sham... or is it?This series is so chock full of twists and turns, I can't begin to organize my thoughts except to say, READ THIS DUET! The plot is so well developed, it's seriously like a movie in your head. If you're a fan of stories with trickle-fed plots that leave you guessing from page one to the final words, this one delivers in spades! Aleatha Romig is the queen of taking a plot and weaving it so full of secrets, deception, suspense, and even an unconventional love story, the reader cannot begin to predict the outcome. Expect the unexpected in The Light series, and you'll truly experience a ride of epic proportions! Bravo!

She loves her husband Jacob , wanting dearly to have a child with him and diligently follows the teachings of the Church of Light . Yet something is wrong, things are getting confused and no matter how hard Sara tries to be the subservient wife that Jacob needs her personality is changing. For Sara there are so many questions clamouring to be heard but is it really safe for her to voice them?So many twists, turns and secrets here. I found the first book Into the Light uncomfortable to read at times but the tension and indeed the action is well and truly ramped up here. Yes Sara and Jacob are a couple but it's not exactly a romance and more a suspense driven story or even a thriller as it gathers pace. Jacobs big secret was revealed at the end of the previous book but here we see Sara getting onboard and wow she's one gutsy lady! Yet in the repellent Church there are so many brainwashed individuals that it just astounds this reader how easily the human psyche can become indoctrinated . Yet even more chilling is the way violent characters thrive within this community.One thing I must mention is the treatment of women in this series. I live in a modern western society and yet unfortunately I'm all too aware that communities, cultures and indeed even countries see nothing wrong with certain traditions. Chastisement , punishment , abuse whatever it's called is wrong but the author doesn't waste time on a soap box , no she showcases it and leaves the reader reeling, full of questions and trying to understand the horror of it all.This series has kept me gripped but this book just blew me away.

Sara and Jacob have a wonderful survival skills and I love their teamwork.  Even if the romance is secondary in this book, their love and trust for each other helped them to survive. The journey they've been through was terrifying and dangerous and I love they faced it courageously. It's nice to read Dylan's point of view and I hope karma bites him someday. The plot is amazing and well crafted. It's very suspenseful and I'm always eager to know what happens next. The epilogue is twistedly brilliant.
