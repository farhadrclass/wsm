The first book and a half are very interesting and the plot is fascinating. DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THESE BOOKS!! Somewhere in the second book, it begins to get quite violent. By the fourth or fifth book, there is holocaust-type violence, children killing in cold blood, and outrageous examples of treachery and hate. These books are dangerous, as the first one is so good.

(Maybedog)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1059653-kelly-h-maybedog", "userReview": "The issue faced by the characters in the book, that of overpopulation and what to do about it, is an important one, and deserves to have a children's book written about it. The possibility that we will one day be limited to two children or fewer per family, and people will undergo forced sterilization, is not so unlikely. China already has strict population control laws (one child) with heavy fines for violators.However the author simplifies the issue to a simple black and white set of extremes. She fails to fully examine the issue of overpopulation. In the book, the need for population leveling is solely due to food shortages. The characters assert that it's mostly due to mismanagement by the government that the famine happened at all. In fact, everything bad appears to be the fault of the controlling, fascist, yet inept government. Even in the end, the author doesn't appear to grasp the reality of the effect of our population explosion: Food is not the only issue. Others include, \"Where will we put all the waste from these people? How will there be enough drinking water? How will we have enough energy to run the machines we need to support our society? Where will resources come from to create things like clothes, furniture, houses, cars? How do we deal with all the pollution this manufacturing brings with that many more people? And how will we survive when we've cut down all the trees and there is no oxygen being produced?The simple answer given in the book seems to be \"we could police ourselves--some people could have more kids if others had fewer\". And who does that policing? We certainly aren't doing it now. What are realistic ways we can address this population issue?The author also appears to be showing how fascist and evil the government is by showing how they outlawed junk food and even meat. Vegetarians are truly the evil of the future. ;) This is an interesting absurdity in that more calories are contained in fat than in anything else, so if food were scarce, it would make more sense to make food very high in fat.One excellent point the author does assert is that those who make the laws often don't follow them. Exceptions are made when it is convenient for those in power. This is an excellent point and I would have liked this to be expanded a bit more. Especially since those in power (the U.S. right now) currently use up many times more resources per person than the non-powerful (3rd world countries). The barons in the book, by excepting themselves from the rules, are causing even greater harm. Yet, even that point isn't explained, just inferred.Perhaps the simplicity is necessary for a children's story, and yet, the heaviness of the topic and the tragedy of the plot, are all mature enough themes that any reader of the book should be able to handle the additional complexity. The author also only shows one side of the story: that of the victims of an extremist, totalitarian government who dealt inappropriately with a very real disaster.What I would have liked to have seen would have been an afterword that addressed some of these issues on a level kids could understand. Just presenting the ideas in a fictional context may be too confusing. Other award-winning children's books that either deal with confusing, heavy issues, or take place in other mystifying eras, have afterwards for more information. I think such a beast would help this book tremendously. As it is, I am curious to know what children reading this book come away with thinking: Is overpopulation bad? Or is the government bad and we don't really need to worry about overpopulation? Because I fear the latter is the message children will walk away with after reading this novel, I have to be very wary about recommending this book."}, {"userName": "Mav", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147811-mav", "userReview": "After reading this, I am very surprised that the publishers determined the targeted reading age group to be \"Age 8-12\".

While Luke was wondering by the window of his room he saw a face on the window from the \"Barons\" the family beside their house, the girl was called Jenniffer and she was also a third child.

Luke Garner is a third child, a hidden child. After the government passed the population law, third children and pets have been outlawed. But Luke's mother had always wanted four boys-\"Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,\" she says.  When Luke's farmland is bought to be turned into a neighborhood of barons, Luke takes interest to watching out of his attic vents. The Sports family's home, the Blonde family's home...he names them all. But wait...was that a face in the window of the Sport's family's house? Luke is too timid to find out...or is he?  In a way, some people I know are like Luke...sitting around letting the world be changed for them. I am not like that at all. If I were Luke, I would try to change the world. I'd stay outside, letting that late summer air blow in my eyes. My mom and dad would say to the questioning people, \"Oh, she's our niece, that's...Patty.\" I would try to be Patty for as long as I could, as I show unquestionable loyalty to my family and close friends.  Anyway, Luke, sitting in his attic, creates a plan. He breaks into the Sports family's house, and finds Jen, another \"shadow child,\" as she puts it. Jen is me, the complete opposite of Luke, bold and daring. Jen and Luke become fast friends, but in April before Jen's rally, Luke turns down her offer. Jen wants to rally in front of the White House, to protest the population law. She and Luke have a big fight, leaving Luke scared and alone. Soon she returns to his house, to say goodbye as she leaves for the rally.  When Jen doesn't come back, Luke is horrified and nervous. What if Jen-he can't bring himself to think of it. Overcome by curiosity, Luke sneaks back to Jen's house, where he is told by Jen's father that she is dead.  At the end of the book, I myself was full of questions. Will Luke change the world like he promised to Jen's spirit? Will he get caught? Will he ever see his family again?

I have mixed feelings about this book. The reason I read it was because a friend of mine asked me about it. Her 11 year-old son read it and he was upset and sad about some things in the book. She was kind of shocked and upset that he read such a book. So I read the book as a favor to her to see what kind of book it really was.

Even in a young adult series each book should be able to stand alone in terms of satisfying the reader that the story is over, this one didn't really do that for me. The character development was ok but again, I'm not going to cut it slack for being for young readers, there were several characters that should have been more dimensional but weren't. As an example Jen's dad needed to be introduced by his name ASAP instead of just referring to him as Jen's dad for three chapters. Another oddity was how easily the author made Jen's idiotic plans come together. It was third person but you never get to see anything Luke doesn't get to see, she might as well have written in first person POV from Luke's perspective because that is basically what you get. If she had used third person more to her advantage we would have seen all that Jen did rather than hear from Luke that she seemed tired. As much as it annoyed me, and it did, I did find it to be an interesting, however conflicted read. The different mentalities about the government was an interesting aspect and showing the characters personality by how they see the government was a good way to get insight into the characters quickly. I ordered this for my twelve year old niece upon a recommendation and decided to read it myself to be sure she'd like it, I ordered the second book immediately upon finishing this one.

And if they were rich they would keep on bribing people and that would make the book boring. B.\tThe things I did not like are how Jen went to the rally and the government did that very cruel thing to the kids.C.\t1. The characters in the story were Luke, Mathew and mark (Luke\u2019s brothers) Jen Luke\u2019s best friend, Luke\u2019s mom and dad, and Jen\u2019s dad. 2. The most important scene of the book was when Luke discovered another third child. Luke was staring at the vents and he saw something move in the Baron\u2019s house. Luke thought that was a third child because he counted that all 28 people in the neighborhood had left. If that did not happen nothing would\u2019ve happen to Luke.3. The genre of the book is science fiction4. The setting of this book is Luke house and Jen house, it was also in the U.S.A were the government controls the kids. This all takes place sometime in the future. D. This book reminds me of the story of Anne Frank and the story of what happened to the Jews when Hitler killed thousands of Jews because he hated them. I think that because the government wants no third children and Hitler doesn\u2019t want Jews. The government killed third children and Hitler killed the Jews in World War II.E. I think the special reason someone will want to read this book is if they have a third child or are a third child because then the book will show them what could happen if they had them in a time when government controlled kids.F. This book does have a sequel. It is the first book in the Shadow Children series. This is the first time I read a book by the author. This book reminds me of Anne Frank because they both are hiding in attics basements and running away from the Germans.

Margaret Peterson Haddix is a prolific author of MG fiction. Among the Hidden is the first book of hers I have read. I selected it particularly because of its premise: due to severe overpopulation, the government has passed laws that allow couples to have only two children. Disobedience is punished by death. Luke is a third child, a shadow child. He can\u2019t go outside, have friends, or even sit at the table with his family for dinner. It\u2019s not much of a life until he meets another shadow child.My WIP (work in progress) also has restrictions on child bearing due to overpopulation, like Among the Hidden. I enjoyed Haddix\u2019s first novel in this series and plan to read the rest. They are short books (this one was 153 pages), so for a reading enthusiast like me, it\u2019s almost a short story. Theology: Government is GodAmong the Hidden is a secular novel. As such, there is no mention of God. Like most dystopian fiction, the government plays the role of God, deciding what\u2019s best for the population. Of course, like any human endeavor, it is prone to corruption by those who crave power.Rating: PGThe book is clean \u2013 no sex, drugs, rock n\u2019 roll. The PG rating is based purely on the somewhat mature content/premise of the book.Social Issues:Based on China\u2019s One Child policy (I assume), Among the Hidden explores government sanctions and the price of disobeying them. Fear of discovery. Children being hidden away because the alternative is death. An underground movement. Conspiracy. Cover ups.

This book had a lot of parts that made me stare into the book. The word hidden in the title has a lot to do with what occurs in the book, actually the book revolves around the word hidden.A strength in the book that I noticed was how the author put in events that where in the characters past to help give a glimpse of the character. For example the author mentioned the main character, Luke celebrating his birthday. In this part of the story, the author tells how Luke felt when he was younger in the past to him being older in the present. Another strength in the book that I noticed was how the author didn\u2019t just use one point of view, she used two different points of views. For example the author wrote about Luke\u2019s past in first person. She wrote in the third person when she talked about Luke daydreamingSomething that people might be asking is, if the main characters are believable? The main characters are believable, because Luke is a person who is willing to take a risk to find out something. This is the same as people who take risks. I can write myself down as someone who would take risks to try something new. The author also does an adequate job with describing, because she described what the character was wearing more than once.This book gives an example how people who make laws jeopardize others\u2019 lives.

The way Haddix wrote this book is mystifying to me she is just brilliant with her theme although she killed a main character.I thought the book was great. The style was different than others it really makes you think. I believe that the story is completely original in many ways. The novel has raised the questions like how many of us would the population law effect. Could this happen? Would innocent kids die just for being born? I recommend this book to ages 10years and up because there is some violence and you need to be able to comprehend the text completely. \u201cAmong the Hidden\u201d is a great thoughtful read, if you like to think you will love this book."}], "description": "SHADOW CHILDREN Luke has never been to school.
