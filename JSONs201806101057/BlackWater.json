This is the second of those. I've read this author off and on, she is so prolific I will probably never read all of her works. This was a quick read, a thinly veiled take on the Kennedy, Kopeckni tragedy. It was just okay for me, a stream of consciousness style with much repetition. Still I love how this writer always tackles new things, her books are never the same, at least those I have read."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Impressive, poignant. At the top of her game, THIS IS J.C.O.!The entire novel is about one single awful AWFUL moment, where everything that splinters from it & before it takes place. It's as short as her \"Blonde\" is long: both hit you viscerally hard. Crystallizing that dreadful moment impeccably."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "The firs time I heard about the so-called Chappaquiddick incident was in college. It was right after Ted Kennedy died, and we were talking about it in one of my classes, and we got around to the various Kennedy scandals, and then my professor remarked, \"you know, everyone on the news keeps talking about all the good things that Ted Kennedy did during his life - no one's mentioned how he was responsible for a woman's death.\"Here are the facts: on the night of July 18th 1969, Ted Kennedy left a party held on Chappaquiddick, an island near Martha's Vineyard. In the car with him was Mary Jo Kopechne, a young woman who had worked on Robert Kennedy's campaign. On their way to the ferry, Ted Kennedy accidentally drove the car off the road and into Poucha Pond. The car landed upside down underwater, and although Kennedy was able to escape the car, Kopechne was not. Kennedy claimed he tried to swim to the car several times to help her, but was unable to reach her. After that, he walked away from the accident site, and the car was discovered the next morning by fishermen who then called the police.Here are the creepy facts and suspicious circumstances: After trying unsuccessfully to reach the car, Ted Kennedy went back to the party, got several of his friends, and they returned to the site and tried to reach the car. When this didn't work, Kennedy took the ferry to his hotel and went to sleep. At no point during these events did he ever contact the police to tell them what had happened. When Kopechne's body was finally retrieved from the car, she was found in the backseat, hanging onto the seat with her face tilted upwards - suggesting that there was a pocket of air inside the car after the crash. According to John Farrar, the diver who retrieved her body: \"It looked as if she were holding herself up to get a last breath of air. It was a consciously assumed position. ... She didn't drown. She died of suffocation in her own air void. It took her at least three or four hours to die.\"I had no idea that this happened, much less that this woman was trapped in a car underwater for at least two hours.. \"Nightmare\" doesn't begin to describe it. You can see how it would make a good subject for a novella: what was going through this woman's head as she was trapped in the car, dying slowly, hoping to be rescued? And what better person to tackle this sensitive and terrifying subject than Joyce \"Men Are Bad and Will Hurt You\" Carol Oates?If you've read Blonde, you have a good idea of how this story is going to go. Oates goes for the obvious and most sinister explanations possible: of course her Kopechne stand-in, Kelly, is a wide-eye and naive idealist with a hefty dose of daddy issues and little romantic experience. Of course her sex life gets described like this:\"She'd cried out, short high-pitched gasping cries, she'd sobbed, she'd heard her voice distant, wild, pleading reverberating out of the corners of the darkened room, Oh I love you, I love you, I love love love you, their bodies slapping and sucking hot-clammy with sweat, hair plastered to their heads with sweat, you know you're somebody's little girl don't you? don't you?\"and this:\"...since girlhood, kissing and being kissed, Kelly Kelleher had always felt, not her own, but the other's, the male's, desire. Quick and galvanizing as an electric shock.Feeling too, once she caught her breath, that familiar wave of anxiety, guilt - I've made you want me, now I can't refuse you.\"Joyce Carol Oates, you are exhausting.And of course Ted Kennedy (aka \"the Senator\") is an aging, predatory creep who takes full advantage of Kelly's daddy issues. Of course he's not only drunk when he drives Kelly to the ferry, but is actually drinking a cocktail as he crashed the car. And of course he not only leaves Kelly behind in the car, but actually kicks her away in his haste to escape.Oates has this gift for inspiring outrage on behalf of the supposed villain of her historical retellings. In my review of Blonde I was furious at her one-sided portrayal of Tony Curtis, who was by all accounts a total douchebag, but something about Oates's version of him seemed so deliberately evil, so patently unfair. Black Water was like that. Could we have a little ambiguity, please? Some sliver of goodness in the Senator, something about Kelly to suggest that she's more than just some wide-eyed innocent trapped in the older man's web? No, we can't - the Senator is a bad, bad man and Kelly was a good, good girl and that is that, thank you. In fact, as I read, I started to be more interested in the Senator's side of the story. There are so many more questions there: when he tried to swim down to the car, did he think Kelly was alive? How, when he was walking back to the party, did he not see any lights from nearby houses and try to call for help there? Why did he call his friend first and not the police? Why didn't he call the police at all? What was going through his mind after he had escaped the car?I wanted to read that story, I realized. Kelly's story was terrifying and sad, of course, but the Senator's was where the real mystery was. All Kelly did was drown (WELL that's the most horrible sentence I've ever typed in my life). Alternating viewpoints - going back and forth between Kelly and the Senator before, during, and after the accident - would have been much more interesting, and would have meant a fuller experience (and a longer book)Ultimately, this story succeeded because it made me really want to read more about the actual Chappaquiddick incident, but not because I appreciated Oates's take on the event. By now, I've learned that when it comes to retelling historical events, she can be extremely one-sided and sensationalist."}, {"userName": "Frona", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58118625-frona", "userReview": "Cautious interwinement of different time modes and perspectives held a lot of promise. Parts of the plot were carefully strung into a captivating, fight-for-breath whole. Along with the lack of misplaced words and clutter, it was what made the flow neat and tidy, but also what opened the possibility of its pitfall. By definition, stringing pieces in a sequence involves staying within the narrow line and connecting similar components. The same happened to the story - the auspicious start did not progress and evolve, but only invoked a complementary platitude.The purpose of books based on true stories, is to give us a possible narrative behind the bare facts. Instead of plausible interpretation and deeper understanding this one delivers only more cliches and pompousness. It felt as if the author had mistaken an image of an all American gal, with unresolved daddy issues and girl-power ambitions, for a person. The protagonist and her relations had no uniqueness that would make them convincing, but remained the manufactured products waving from the billboard, that one sometimes wants to get to know, but never can. Yellow pages of an artsy journal would have as much effect. Life can be but a series of coincidences and its end a peak of absurdity, but at least it has some moments of significance, which is a fact this book desperately tries to avoid."}, {"userName": "Romie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9597040-romie", "userReview": "Although the Chappaquiddick incident was before my time, Kennedy hagiography wasn't. Still isn't. That myth of Camelot stuff. I hate it. If I'd moved up to Massachusetts any earlier than I did, Ted Kennedy would have been my senator. Although I am a Democrat and agreed with a lot of the work he did, I don't know that I could have voted for him. I reflexively vote against all Kennedys, always. Because of stuff like Chappaquiddick and its aftermath.It's a case where there was probably never going to be justice and where I don't know what justice might have looked like. The closest we're probably going to get is this book, which is fiction, and which echoes the central events. But only echoes - it's set in a different time, with different people.I have mixed feelings about Joyce Carol Oates. I like the stories she chooses to tell, and I like her dreamlike attacks on and explorations of the ways we socialize or suppress female sexuality. At the same time, I find her prose prosaic (more so when she's trying for poetry) and think that her universal archetypes (if we can call them that) flatten and limit my experience of my own humanity. That's not me in there.Do I like the recasting of the Chappaquiddick story as an allegory for the power imbalances between older men in power and younger women out of power, the ways in which the women are doomed sacrifices? Do I feel more powerless after reading the book, as though Oates is complicit in taking away the agency of a woman who in real life was clearly motivated? I don't know. I do think the book is worth reading and talking about.One thing I can say is it made me more aware of the way we tell crime stories and scandal stories through the eyes of the aggressor. Yes, the victim isn't there to tell their side, but the perp usually isn't telling either. I've thought before about whether we're re-victimizing the victims by treating them as objects (sometimes of veneration, sometimes not) to protect ourselves from existential angst (who wants to self-identify as dead?) but this book brought home the emotional truth of it - along with the possibility that as they're fighting for life, some of them are already starting to absorb a sense of themselves as inherently passive (yet still culpable)."}, {"userName": "George K.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4675995-george-k", "userReview":

She asked me if I had any interest in going with her to hear an author she liked go speak. I had never heard of this Joyce Carol Oats woman. (Seriously.) So we went to this huge church in St. Paul and the place was packed. I was surprised - This many people for some author? Hu. Cool. (I know - I was young and pretty darn clueless.) We were all just sitting there and then all of a sudden you could feel a current in the room. I look over and this tiny woman (who looked like someone's executive assistant) walked in and took the podium. She read. It was really great. A few days after the reading my co-worker brought in this book with a thank you for going with her to the reading. I read the book and I have to say it still haunts me.

A scandal, which largely sensationalized the life of Mary Jo Kopechne, who died in a car accident whose circumstances are reasonably suspect. But Oates' novel (or what I can recall, having read it in high school), seems less intent on realizing Kopechne's life as it is intent on villainizing Ted Kennedy or rather the archetype of powerful men taking advantage of impressionable young women. I have no problem with Oates attempting to take on the latter archetype (or even Kennedy for that matter) except that she does it in the kind of one-sided screed that diminishes the agency and individualism of the Kopechne-analogue. In speaking about her story, Where are you going? Where have you been? which was turned into a film, Oates remarked on the difficulty of adapting a story for the screen saying that a writer only works in a, \"single dimension.\" (That story, Where are you going... is also the story of a young woman taken in by a charismatic older man, with a similar fatalistic trajectory involving a fateful drive and is also based on true events.)My problem with Oates largely lies in her work existing in a \"single dimension,\" (as well as the fact that great art transcends its medium) and that her characters are often types (helpless and tragic girls vs. knowing and powerful men) that are never transcend their types and never live off the page. She is understandably upset about this recurring pattern of misogyny but never gives us anything but the Chick-tract version of events and exists solely in Oates singular dimensions. Giving a voice to the voiceless is only powerful when that perspective gives us more insight, instead Oates confirms only victim-hood and powerlessness."}, {"userName": "Timothy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13015682-timothy", "userReview": "A repetitive stream of consciousness tale told at the moment of a deadly event in a young woman\u2019s life.

I wanted to love this, but I really, really didn't.JCO uses a blunt, visceral style, heavy in repetition, and repeatedly culminating with Kopechne's stand-in, Kelly Kelleher's, thoughts during the crash and as she's accepting her fate.I couldn't stand the way JCO wrote Kelleher, and it turns out I just had to turn to the Amazon description of her to nail it: \"Kelly becomes the very embodiment of the vulnerable, romantic dreams of bright and brave women, drawn to the power that certain men command.\"I hate, hate, hate this approach to this character. Kelleher is supposed to be a 26-year-old political journalist who then ends up fawning over \"The Senator\" (never given a name) for the fact that he's even talking to her. Someone at that age, and at that point in their career, would be well-versed in men with power and know how to talk to them without going weak at the knees. When you're a journalist, you learn at a very young age that men will try to wield their power to get you into bed. Hell, when you're a woman in any career path, you probably learn this. I had men fawning over me when I was a teenage music journalist! So I just don't buy a journalist in their mid-20s as naive and totally clueless, but Black Water is written in rose-colored glasses. She's written as too naive, and overly vulnerable and romantic for someone who's a 26-year-old political journalist who likely just wants to go get her fuck on. And if you want to shift the conversation to the real life incident, I don't think Mary Jo Kopechne was this much of a naive twit, either - she was a political influencer! She had been in politics for six years when this happened - I don't think she was as naive and romantic as this character that's supposed to be based on her.Maybe I'm just a cynical old broad now, but I would've bought into this if the approach to Kelleher had been less about her being some sort of idealistic \"good girl.\" I don't think that's a flattering or realistic portrait of modern women at that age. Not all women have to feel romantically about a man to want to go to bed with him. Maybe she just wanted to get laid! That would've been fine! I would've much preferred a book that didn't have such a one-sided goody-two-shoes kind of character. It would've made more sense if Kelleher had gone home with him because she wanted to try to scoop a story on him, or if it was simply that she liked sex and saw an opportunity to get laid. Instead, we get her impressions of the Senator contrasted with an old boyfriend. Homegirl, the Senator is not going to be your boyfriend, the Senator just wants to get off. Augh!I also really struggled with the idea that a woman would write another woman to be this stupid. Just, wow.Anyway, I could tell that JCO is a good writer and all of that, but I hated the way she wrote Kelleher, and since the book is from Kelleher's POV, that pretty much killed the whole thing for me. Not a great first impression of JCO , so if anyone has read something of hers that was good, let me know."}, {"userName": "Sal Jenko", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49428333-sal-jenko", "userReview": "Una scrittura ingegnosa, a tratti di grandissima presa. Dinamica e ansiogena. Il punto di vista di una mente confusa e agonizzante.  La trama si espande da un piccolo nucleo, limitato nel tempo: l'auto con a bordo il Senatore Ted Kennedy e la giovane Kelly esce di strada e piomba nell'acqua nera. I capitoli ripetono ossessivamente la scena perlopi\u00f9 dal punto di vista di Kelly ampliandola (e quindi contestualizzandola) con variazioni, intrusioni, fioriture di memorie, assilli, sogni, speranze deformate. I pensieri sono come cerchi concentrici nell'acqua. Ogni cerchio un frenetico pensiero che si allontana da chi sta affogando. I cerchi nascono dall'incidente, si differenziano, si allargano, si fondono gli uni con gli altri. \u00c8 uno strano e bellissimo risultato allucinato quello ottenuto dalla Oates. La mente che fotografa l'avvenimento, \"s'impressiona\" con particolari e sensazioni fulminee e li rimanda poi a ripetizione impastandoli di volta in volta con quel che emerge di conscio e inconscio da una mente sofferente, disfunzionale. E intanto l'ossigeno viene meno liberando le allucinazioni e uno stato di pseudo-dormiveglia della coscienza che ancora spera e inventa e cambia continuamente ci\u00f2 che emerge.  Il tempo si deforma. Pi\u00f9 volte. Al momento dell'incidente: \"Perch\u00e9 in quei momenti il tempo subisce un'accelerazione. Con l'avvicinarsi del punto d'impatto il tempo procede alla velocit\u00e0 della luce.\" E poi in senso contrario in una sospensione temporale subacquea in cui il cervello comincia a buttare fuori memorie ed immagini a ritmo crescente, folle, angoscioso perch\u00e9 l'aria sta finendo. Una sorta di buco bianco che vomita materia, storie e universi paralleli in cui il passato rinasce e il futuro non \u00e8 segnato.  La Oates fa un uso intelligente e forse unico del flusso di coscienza applicandolo ai momenti di sovreccitazione, di ingorgo cerebrale, quando la mente ottenebrata e allarmata oltre il concepibile rompe gli argini sintattici per rigettare con furia il suo contenuto. Un utilizzo pertinente ed espressivo e che soprattutto stabilisce un continuo dialogo con la narrazione pi\u00f9 piana delle memorie e con i terrorizzati \"flash\" di lucidit\u00e0, variando splendidamente il ritmo della narrazione e rinnovando ogni volta per contrasto l'impatto dei momenti pi\u00f9 angosciosi ed affannati affidati al flusso.  L'evento minimo, limitato nel tempo, riesce tramite queste soluzioni a caricarsi quanto pi\u00f9 possibile di dramma e risvolti umani (ricordi semplici, affettuosi, insicurezze, ideali, l'attaccamento alla vita) e riesce perci\u00f2 a restituire \"dimensione\" e importanza a chi, nella realt\u00e0, da vittima e protagonista di una tragedia era diventata unicamente la comprimaria dimenticata e occultata di uno scandalo associato all'ingombrante nome dei Kennedy."}, {"userName": "Larry Bassett", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett", "userReview": "In Cold Blood is Truman Capote\u2019s 1965 effort to create the \u201cnew\u201d genre of the non-fiction novel, a fictionalized version of a true story. Norman Mailer followed in 1968 with Armies of the Night. Joyce Carol Oates creates this kind of novel regularly. Black Water, published in 1992, is one example. This book is about the Chappaquiddick incident in 1969 in which Ted Kennedy left the scene of an accident, leaving a young woman passenger in his car to die.  Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident after causing injury and received a two-month suspended jail sentence. The incident became a national scandal, and may have influenced Kennedy's decision not to campaign for President of the United States in 1972 and 1976. Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappaqu... The novel deals with details of the victim\u2019s feelings and actions related to the accident. No similar view is presented of Kennedy. The author deals harshly with Senator Kennedy who admittedly failed to notify the police until nine hours after the incident. Some believe that the victim lived for some time after the car was submerged because of an air bubble inside the car but eventually died of suffocation when the oxygen in the bubble was used up. The authorities determined that death was by drowning although there was no autopsy to verify that.This short novel tells a story about an event that was in the news for months in 1969 and 1970. Of course, no one knows the thoughts of the victim and the actions of Kennedy also have unverified aspects. The outcome of the legal process if this had not been a Kennedy is unknown.The book is made up of 32 mostly very short chapters. There is some repetition of phrases to increase the dramatic impact. This is a drama, the life of a young woman ending as her mind both cannot believe that it is happening while at the same time knowing she is dying. And the accident too, one day she would transform the accident, the nightmare of being trapped in a submerged car, the near-drowning, the rescue. It was horrible \u2013 hideous. I was trapped and the water was seeping in and he\u2019d gone for help and fortunately there was air in the car, we\u2019d had the windows shut tight, the air-conditioner on, yes I know it\u2019s a miracle if you believe in miracles.  But she wasn\u2019t rescued. He didn\u2019t save her or call the people who might have been able if they had been contacted immediately.

Una Toyota nera, guidata dal Senatore, un uomo di mezza et\u00e0, donnaiolo e bevitore, che guida con in mano il drink per il viaggio, trasporta lui e la sua nuova amica Kelly, conosciuta ad una festa lo stesso giorno in casa di conoscenze comuni, verso un traghetto diretto sulla terraferma, ad una stanza d\u2019albergo. La velocit\u00e0 eccessiva, la strada sterrata, il buio della notte, la guida spericolata, tutto insomma concorre al verificarsi dell\u2019incidente: l\u2019auto esce di strada e precipita nell\u2019acqua nera del fiume Indian Creek. Da questo momento prende il via l\u2019angoscioso e angosciante flusso di pensieri di Kelly, frammentato in una continua serie di ricordi, di impressioni, di flashback in cui, sul punto di morte, l\u2019intera sua esistenza di brava ragazza americana le scorre nella mente, come tanti tasselli di un puzzle. Anche la scrittura della Oates si adegua alla situazione ed \u00e8 frammentaria, con lunghi periodi senza punteggiatura che si alternano con altri spesso oscuri, che uniscono episodi diversi della vita della ragazza, dall\u2019infanzia al momento attuale, in un mescolamento che esprime in pieno la confusione e la concitazione dei pensieri di chi sta morendo.Una giovane americana di ottima famiglia, figlia di un avvocato di Boston, educata secondo severi principi puritani, conosce un uomo di potere, uno dei suoi \u201cmiti\u201d, sul quale all\u2019universit\u00e0 scrisse anche una tesina, un \u201canimale politico\u201d avvezzo ad ogni genere di intrighi e di tresche, e in un pomeriggio decide di andarsene con lui dalla festa e di passarci almeno la notte. Il senso di colpa, derivazione della sua rigida educazione, la divora: \u201cho fatto in modo che tu mi desiderassi e ora non posso dirti di no\u201d.All\u2019analisi del rapporto tra gli uomini di potere e le giovani donne che incontrano sul loro cammino (argomento attualmente all\u2019ordine del giorno in Italia, seppur nel suo aspetto pi\u00f9 turpe e indegno\u2013perch\u00e9 non \u00e8 un romanzo ma \u00e8 purtroppo la realt\u00e0 quella che viviamo-), si affiancano temi di critica sociale e politica, quali la critica alla pena di morte, \u201cun omicidio premeditato inflitto arbitrariamente dallo stato\u201d, e la critica alla politica del presidente Bush senior che ha portato alla guerra del golfo.In complesso la lettura mi ha coinvolto, anche se all\u2019inizio ho avuto difficolt\u00e0 ad abituarmi alla particolarit\u00e0 della scrittura; poi sono stata anch\u2019io trascinata nell\u2019acqua nera accanto a Kelly."}, {"userName": "Chaitra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra", "userReview": "This was a wasted exercise. It wasn't offensively bad, but I did not think it was good either. Black Water is inspired by the real life incident of Chappaquiddick. Senator Ted Kennedy drove his car off a bridge and in the accident that resulted, the female passenger Mary Jo Kopechne died. What makes this unlike other accidents is that Senator Kennedy failed to report the accident which almost certainly contributed to her death.Oates decides to concentrate on the unfortunate female passenger, giving her a voice through the book's heroine Kelly Kelleher. It's written in a stream of consciousness narrative as Kelly struggles to find the last pockets of air in the car. It is sufficiently tragic, and compelling for the first couple of chapters. After that, it starts to go around in circles, revealing nothing new or notable. She is (according to Oates), a young, foolish girl, seduced by a powerful, older man. This we know within the first 20 pages. For the next 125+ pages, we're beaten over the head with this. Kelly's life is sketchy and we only learn that she's lonely and sensitive and na\u00efve. She's the perfect victim for the older man, the senator she's written her senior honors thesis on. Charming, listens to her a bit, makes out with her, and then leaves her to die. Neither does the Senator have any motive other than political in letting her die, nor does Kelly become anything more than a victim. I don't know. I'm not sure why this was written - what's the point if you're going to only play in archetypes? If only one point of view is presented, and that too skimming the surface? And because it doesn't go deep, there is nothing to write about - just banal sentences about how Kelly was the chosen one, and then she died but no. I would have appreciated the book more if I knew more than some vague snatches about how Kelly came to be there, how a girl so bright as her could be fooled by a man. I would have definitely rated this higher, had Oates written more than a page with the Senator's motives. Yes, the circumstances of the real life were suspicious, but in this case, he was drunk, he was in an accident and it is likely he might have been in shock. Even giving him a dilemma would have made Oates a better writer, and this a better book.

A blurb on the back of Black Water from the Los Angeles Times calls the book \"the ballad of Chappaquiddick\" and even though the internal chronology places this after 1990, in Maine not Massachusetts, the young woman involved is named \"Kelly Kelleher\" and the driver involved is only called \"the Senator\" this is obviously a roman \u00e0 clef based on that incident. So you have a tragic event with lots of resonance for Americans and by a celebrated author who has won the National Book Award and been a Pulitzer Prize Finalist. So this book should be amazing--but I don't feel it is. I think this is just an author who is a mismatch for me stylistically. I had tried before this her We Were the Mulvaneys and found myself underwhelmed. This particular book left me decidedly unmoved and even feeling some distaste. I think a lot of that is because I could see the seams of her modernist techniques too well. There are chapters of less than 100 words, staccato sentences, sentences without punctuation, ones with unending lists, run-ons, constant looping back to moments during the accident between narrating events earlier in the day and in Kelly's life, and repeated phrases such as \"Am I going to die? Like this?\" and \"And the black water filled her lungs.\" I recently read a book by Salman Rushdie using such modernist techniques and was charmed--it just worked. Here the literary techniques seemed stagey, and given the real life tragedy depicted within living memory that made this come across to me as exploitative and cheesy. Still, this might make a good introduction to Oates, to see if you might like her style. It's very short, only 154 pages and with a stripped down enough style you could read it in a couple of hours."}, {"userName": "Leo Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7619789-leo-robertson", "userReview": "The influence of her faves- Joan Didion, Virginia Woolf, etc. A bit like that film Enter the Void in the narrative jumping about.Here's a weird comment: the woman drowning in the car was a little too visual. The real terror is that you can't see ANYTHING. You wouldn't know what was up, where the bubble of air would be... I had an interesting point to make about the capsizing helicopter simulator/ series of dark rooms in a black out thing I did for a qualification to go to offshore platforms but my husband was saying something about dinner, I think? And I lost interest in making it. But essentially, buh-lieve me! Shit is scary!But between this and Zombie, which was also based on a real-life case, I think JCO has a habit of too much of her own assumptions and skating the surface of what happened for dramatic effect and not really enough justice to the source material. Like, this is almost there: it has for sure honed in on a horrific event, but more layers of verisimilitude could've been built upon it to really capture the horror, and as I say, the horror itself in fact required less senses and visuals, because they wouldn't be available.Maybe you can't get on an offshore platform course, JCO, but fill your bath with cold water, turn off the lights and get in and roll around until you don't know which way's up then open your eyes. Then imagine you're strapped the fuck in and up is way way up, if you even knew what that is? Also imagine, oddly, that your body's flooded with strangely dissociating neurotransmitters and such that dislocate you from the horror, and there's a weird, matter-of-fact functionality about how you would think: 'Oh, there we go, off into the water.

And very artfully done. It\u2019s a book that can easily be consumed in a single sitting: yesterday I bought it, walked to the park and sat down on a bench, and finished it about an hour and a half later. It\u2019s the type of read that\u2019s broken into short segments, each segment leading you to automatically turn to the next. The rhythm of the prose synchs with the terror of the novella\u2019s circumstances, which is a characteristic I love so much about Oates.Black Water tells the story of an all-American type young woman (Kelly) who meets a senator at a friend\u2019s barbecue. She leaves the party with him, and his car plunges into sewages, enclosing the car in a vessel of filthy, rising waters. This is where present time begins: the moment of the wreck. The reader is then taken back in time to learn random details of Kelly\u2019s past, along with the day\u2019s events that lead up to the wreck. We even learn that she\u2019d written her college thesis on the senator himself.Although nearly every page references politics, Black Water is less of a political story and more about truth/deceit, and outer appearances vs. true personality.I didn\u2019t realize it as I read, but the scenario closely resembles the famous Chappaquiddick incident of 1969\u2014although the book obviously isn\u2019t directly about this incident, considering it takes place in the early 90s."}, {"userName": "Misha", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2205814-misha", "userReview": "Black Water is a haunting narrative of the final moments of Kelly Kelleher, a young woman whose impulsive decision to pursue her attraction to an older man leads to her death in a car accident. Kelleher, of course, is a stand-in for Mary Jo Kopechne, the young woman who lost her life in a car accident with Ted Kennedy at Chappaquiddick in 1969. I found it interesting that Oates chose to update the story to the early '90s (contemporary for when the book was written) and write The Senator as Kennedy in his mid-50s rather than the young rising political star whose presidential aspirations were thwarted by the scandal. But this isn't a story about Kennedy's lost dreams. It's about giving voice to the young woman who lost her life, whose name has become a footnote in the history of political scandals. The story is fractured, fragmented and repetitive, but it's a structure that works to capture those last frantic, hopeful moments when death is closing in but Kelly keeps faith in her Senator to rescue her. It's sad and tragic and thoroughly absorbing. I felt for Kelly. I even felt for The Senator, who was a very real, very flawed man trying to live up to others' expectations of him."}, {"userName": "Thompson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5862209-thompson", "userReview": "This is a fictionalized account of Ted Kennedy and the drowning of Mary Jo Kopechne. Most of the book is the thinking of the fictionalized Mary Jo. Much of the thinking is the confused ramblings of a liberal who substitutes feeling for thinking. This feeling keeps the drowning woman sure that the senator who abandoned her will rescue her. Typical of the lack of real thinking of the drowning liberal is her thinking that the support of abortion by liberals is nobel, but by conservatives is racism. Of course this is typical of overlooking the socialistic roots of racism - the eugenics supported by many democrats, nazis (who were socialists) and even Sanger. Sanger called blacks \"human weeds\" in \"Pivot of Civilization.\" Other bubble headed thinking is all the other liberal nonsense about \"free\" medical care and a slew of social programs that are blocked, not by reality, but by mean spirited conservatives.

Reescritura en clave femeninaGracias a la Wikipedia encuentro esta informaci\u00f3n sobre el Chappaquiddick incident :\u201cThe Chappaquiddick incident was a single-vehicle automobile accident on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts on July 18, 1969. The incident involved longtime U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy. His young colleague, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned. According to his own testimony, Kennedy accidentally drove his car off a one-lane bridge and into a tidal channel before swimming free, leaving the scene, and not reporting about the accident for nine hours. Meanwhile, Kopechne had died in the car through drowning or suffocation. The next day, Kopechne\u2019s body and the car were finally recovered by divers. Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of a crash after causing injury and later received a two-month suspended jail sentence. The Chappaquiddick incident became a national scandal, and likely influenced Kennedy\u2019s decision not to campaign for President in 1972 and 1976\u201dEn 1969 el Senador Ted Kennedy su acompa\u00f1ante Mary Jo Kopechne tuvieron un accidente de coche tras una fiesta que tuvo lugar en la peque\u00f1a isla de Chappaquidick, como consecuencia de dicho accidente Mary Jo muri\u00f3 ahogada. El asunto estuvo cargado de mucha pol\u00e9mica debido a la tardanza del senador a la hora de notificar los hechos (nueve horas despu\u00e9s del accidente) tras conseguir \u00e9l escapar del coche. Este hecho supuso, sin lugar a dudas, la muerte pol\u00edtica del candidato, que no se present\u00f3 como candidato a la presidencia en a\u00f1os sucesivos.Veintitr\u00e9s a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s (1992), Joyce Carol Oates, decidi\u00f3 acometer la dif\u00edcil tarea de convertir dicha tragedia (bien conocida por el p\u00fablico general) en un drama con el nombre de Black Water (m\u00e1s una novella) donde explora las pasiones, los miedos y las decisiones puntuales que pudieron ocasionar esta situaci\u00f3n.En esta claustrof\u00f3bica narraci\u00f3n Oates adopta una diferente perspectiva, en este caso la de la v\u00edctima (con otro nombre: Kelly Kelleher) enriqueciendo la historia con un punto de vista m\u00e1s terrenal, para desentra\u00f1ar lo m\u00e1s humano. La estructura que escoge parte del hecho conocido, el accidente, contado en el mismo momento en el que ocurre: \u201cShe heard, as the Toyota smashed into a guardrail that, rusted to lacework, appeared to give way without retarding the car\u2019s speed at all, The Senator\u2019s single startled expletive \u2013\u201cHey!\u201dAnd then the water out of nowhere flooding over them. Over the hood of the car. Over the cracked windshield. Churning in roiling waves as if alive, and angry.\u201dA partir de ah\u00ed, se producir\u00e1n sucesivas analepsis que le sirven para establecer los momentos anteriores al suceso en cuesti\u00f3n, en todos estos momentos escoge una serie de estrategias que son muy destacables para transmitir ese nuevo punto de vista:\u201cAnd then The Senator said, a chuckle deep in this throat like phlegm, \u201cthis is a shortcut, Kelly. There\u2019s only one direction and we can\u2019t be lost.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said Kelly, very carefully very tactfully, licking her lips which were parched, staring ahead too but seeing nothing except the headlights illuminating the tunnel of the road, vegetation, mirror-shards glittering out of the shadows,\u201d \u2013but the road is so poor.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s a shortcut, Kelly. I\u2019m sure.\u201d La v\u00edctima, Kelly, tiene nombre; el senador, sin embargo, no es nombrado en ninguna ocasi\u00f3n. De esta manera consigue que empaticemos con la verdadera v\u00edctima de la situaci\u00f3n, su acompa\u00f1ante, la que fue abandonada; por otro lado, esta humanizaci\u00f3n contrasta con la figura de un ente poderoso, el senador y posible candidato a la presidencia: puede ser Ted Kennedy pero podr\u00eda ser otro con un resultado parecido; que utiliza su poder para dominar, para tomar decisiones que generan una condescendencia con los que est\u00e1n debajo de \u00e9l; en el texto anterior esta actitud est\u00e1 presente cuando le dice a Kelly que ha cogido un atajo y \u00e9l no puede estar equivocado; ante este manejo del poder investido en su persona, Kelly solo puede callarse y aceptar lo que le comenta; es dominada por la figura patriarcal que no le deja estar en desacuerdo.De hecho, Kelly, siente la atracci\u00f3n de dicho poder, siente que se siente feliz solo por el hecho de que el Senador pronuncie su nombre; no quiere disentir de lo que le diga porque quiere creer que ella es especial para \u00e9l:Kelly! \u2013her heart tripped absurdly, her face went hot, hearing her name, that name given her by schoolgirl friends, on this man\u2019s lips. So casually so intimately on this man\u2019s lips as if he knows me, feels affection for me.Just before the car flew off the road.\u201dPrecisamente por ello, Kelly idealiza la figura de este ente de poder que se supone que debe guiar el destino de la sociedad norteamericana hasta el punto de atribuirle cualidades humanas que, sin embargo, son exactamente lo contrario de lo que ella piensa; Oates no duda en presentar al senador como una figura manipuladora que muestra una imagen lo suficientemente atractiva para abusar de su poder y conseguir conquistar a quien se proponga, nuevamente la imagen del poder masculino como dominador del g\u00e9nero m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil hist\u00f3ricamente, los siguientes textos presentan a la perfecci\u00f3n la actitud de entrega e idealizaci\u00f3n de Kelly y el dominio, el abuso de poder de la figura manipuladora del senador:\u201cHe turned out to be really warm, really nice, not at all condescending, Kelly Kelleher began to compose her account of that memorable Fourth of July on Grayling Island \u2013spoke to us all as if we were, not just equals, but old friends.He\u2019d kissed her, too. But that was later.\u201d\u201cShaking Kelly Kelleher\u2019s small-boned hand, squeezing. \u201cKelly, is it? Callie? Kelly.\u201dShe\u2019d laughed. Liking the sound of her schoolgirl name on a U.S. senator\u2019s lips.He wasn\u2019t as I\u2019d imagined him, he turned out to be really warm, really nice, not at all condescending-Shaping the precise words that would encapsulate, in her memory, in her recounting of memory to friends, perhaps Mr Spader himself who had known the Senator years ago but was distant from him now.How courteous, genuinely friendly, interested in who we were and what we thought of his Senate proposals, the Medicaid, the welfare reform, yes and he is a visionary. I don\u2019t think it is an exaggeration to say-How crucial for us to rehearse the future, in words.Never to doubt that you will live to utter them.\u201dEsta idealizaci\u00f3n desencadena un sentimiento de culpa en la mujer, \u00e9l es perfecto, amable, es decisivo para el futuro del pa\u00eds; en este contexto, que se hayan estrellado y puedan morir ahogados ha sido causado por ella: no quer\u00eda ofenderle antes dici\u00e9ndole que se hab\u00eda equivocado, y esa indecisi\u00f3n les ha llevado a una situaci\u00f3n l\u00edmite. Es parad\u00f3jico, ya que, estructuralmente, ella siente que es la culpable, olvida que el hombre se puede equivocar (y esa es la m\u00e1s probable causa del accidente), pero lo hace porque est\u00e1 coaccionada por un sentimiento \u00edntimo impreso a fuego en su interior: el hombre no se puede equivocar, menos si se trata de un personaje tan poderoso como es el senador; estamos de nuevo ante una estructuralidad que limita la libertad de la mujer en su capacidad de elecci\u00f3n adem\u00e1s de obligarle a actitudes perniciosas:\u201cKelly Kelleher who, after G\u2014-, vowed she would never take her life for all life is precious.And so it was a matter of her strength, her will. The concentration of her soul. Not to give in. Not to weaken. The black water was rising by choppy degrees to splash over her chin, her mouth, but If I can keep by head up it was a matter of knowing what to do and doing it.Why had she hesitated to say they were lost, why hadn\u2019t she told him to turn the car around, to reverse their course, oh please! \u2013but she had not dared offend him.The black water was her fault, she knew. You just don\u2019t want to offend them. Even the nice ones.He was nice. Even knowing they were so closely watching, memorizing him, certain of his remarks, his jokes. The way, in the spontaneous heat of a tennis volley, he gripped his jaws tight, bared his teeth.\u201d Joyce Carol Oates es muy valiente a lo largo de esta peque\u00f1a gran obra, no solo por hablarnos de la corrupci\u00f3n del poder y sus consecuencias, sino por dar voz a la v\u00edctima, adoptando una perspectiva mucho m\u00e1s humana, conmovedora y, desde luego, m\u00e1s terrenal. Es un canto lleno de indignaci\u00f3n ante las figuras que abusan de \u00e9l."}], "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-nominated novel from the author of the New York Times bestselling novel We Were the MulvaneysJoyce Carol Oates has taken a shocking story that has become an American myth and, from it, has created a novel of electrifying power and illumination. Kelly Kelleher is an idealistic, twenty-six-year-old \u201cgood girl\u201d when she meets the Senator at a Fourth of July party. In a brilliantly woven narrative, we enter her past and her present, her mind and her body as she is fatally attracted to this older man, this hero, this soon-to-be-lover. Kelly becomes the very embodiment of the vulnerable, romantic dreams of bright and brave women, drawn to the power that certain men command\u2014at a party that takes on the quality of a surreal nightmare; in a tragic car ride that we hope against hope will not end as we know it must end. One of the acknowledged masters of American fiction, Joyce Carol Oates has written a bold tour de force that parts the black water to reveal the profoundest depths of human truth.", "title": "Black Water", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15974.Black_Water", "average": 3.53, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388283255l/15974.jpg", "reviews": 510, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3524.Joyce_Carol_Oates", "name": "Joyce Carol Oates"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15974.Black_Water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1357460.Black_Water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15734401-kara-su", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11137273-acqua-nera", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9688440-acqua-nera", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5204.We_Were_the_Mulvaneys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15967.The_Falls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15972.The_Gravedigger_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15975.Blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156222.Foxfire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
