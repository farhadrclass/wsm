I enjoyed The Windup Girl and I especially loved The Drowned Cities. The latter was such a powerful and horrifying book about the effects of war, particularly on kids.There were things about The Water Knife that I can and will praise highly. Things that made me want to thrust it into the hands of anyone who bothers to listen to my recommendations.And then there are passages like this:\"Numbers flickering over the various catchment basins of the Rocky Mountains - red, amber, green - monitoring how much snow cover remained and variation off the norm as it melted. Other numbers, displaying the depths of reservoirs and dams, from the Blue Mesa Dam on the Gunnison, to the Navajo Dam on the San Juan, to the Flaming Gorge Dam on the Green. Over it all, emergency purchase prices on streamflows and futures offers scrolled via NASDAQ, available open-market purchase options if she needed to recharge the depth in Lake Mead[...]\"that made me think...You see, whatever kind of pretty label we try to dress Bacigalupi's books up in - like \"dystopian\", \"post-apocalyptic\" or \"steampunk\" - the truth is that he writes old-fashioned, hard, sciencey science-fiction. It seems wrong to criticize the guy just for being so much smarter than me, but his frequent descriptions of the climate, water scarcity, and its economic impact had me completely lost and made the book so slow at times. I had flashbacks to when I was in college and had to write an essay on the water wars between India and Pakistan.The reason I probably don't fall in love with a lot of traditional sci-fi is because I like people-based stories. Even the most inventive of plot ideas can leave me feeling cold if I don't give a damn who it's happening to. Which is actually why I still really enjoyed a lot of this book. When we're not learning about the environment, we get to meet some damn interesting characters.This is a world where water shortages have given rise to the water equivalent of drug lords and the spies/terrorists who work for them - water knifes. Angel Velasquez is one of the best and baddest water knifes and he's been sent to Phoenix to investigate the rumours of a new water source. But he's going to have to get past Lucy Monroe, a strong and badass character who I liked immediately.In fact, the author has created some fascinating characters here. His action scenes are perfectly-constructed, his dialogue is realistic and a pleasure to read. He adds just the right amount of grit and creep factor to a few chapters that had me on the edge of my seat. It's just a shame that roughly half of this book was a struggle to get through. The fact that I kept pushing through the mind-numbing bits to get to the good stuff should tell you how much I thought it was worth it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Rick Riordan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25375513-rick-riordan", "userReview": "Adult science fictionBacigalupi is the master of ecological dystopian novels. He describes the world after climate meltdown in frighteningly believable detail. I loved his novel of a drowned Bangkok, The Windup Girl, and his two young adult novels set in the wastelands of the former U.S. \u2013 Ship Breaker and The Drowned Cities. The Water Knife is set closer to our own time. The United States still exists, but it is frayed and crumbling. The Western states are competing for scarce water supplies, and the competition is getting ruthless: legal battles, sabotage, paramilitary raids, everything sort of outright war. Given what is happening to our water supplies in America and worldwide, the scenario is scary and gripping. This is not so much science fiction as \u201cthis could be us in about forty years if we don\u2019t stop being idiots\u201d fiction.The story revolves around three characters \u2013 a disillusioned reporter who is covering the slow violent death of Phoenix, Arizona, a young girl who is a refugee from the collapsed state of Texas, and a ruthless \u201cwater knife\u201d who works for the Las Vegas government to procure water rights at any cost. When someone in Phoenix finds legal documents that could completely change the balance of power, all the players will stop at nothing to get them, and our three protagonists must scramble to make a score before they are destroyed in the crossfire. The plot is great, the characters relatable, but what will really haunt you is how well the author builds this near-future world. It reads less like a fantasy and more like an augury of what will happen to us \u2013 and the prediction is not pretty."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201cIf I could put my finger on the moment we genuinely f**ked ourselves, it was the moment we decided that data was something you could use words like believe or disbelieve around.\u201d \nMassive Dust storms from abandoned farmland add to the misery of those left alive.Water is going to be more expensive than gasoline. Water is going to be more precious than gold. Water is going to be fought over. \u201cSome people had to bleed so other people could drink. Simple as that.\u201dThe world in the future is going to tilt sideways and only a few are going to be able to hold on.When I lived in Phoenix in the 1990s, the city was in constant litigation with Los Angeles. Both communities were/are dependent on the Colorado River. L.A. was ascerting that Phoenix kept more than their share of the water from the Colorado River. This was true. The boom of large cities like Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas moved a lot of people from places that had adequate sources of water to places where water is scarce. The weather in these communities, though too warm for some people during the summer, is a dry heat, and for most of the year the temperatures are moderate. It is easy to live there. I was meeting people all the time who gave up great paying jobs in Chicago, New York, Washington D.C. etc. to come live in The Valley even though they made considerably less money. In 1986 (revised 1993), a reporter by the name of Marc Reisner wrote a book called Cadillac Desert that talked about a coming apocalypse in the West over water. \u201cIn the West, it is said, water flows uphill toward money. And it literally does, as it leaps three thousand feet across the Tehachapi Mountains in gigantic siphons to slake the thirst of Los Angeles, as it is shoved a thousand feet out of Colorado River canyons to water Phoenix and Palm Springs and the irrigated lands around them.\u201d  Water, worth billions then, is worth more now and will be worth an incalculable amount in the near future. But then, ultimately, we can put a dollar amount on just about anything. The problem is that you and I may not have enough. \u201dThe Doomsday preppers will be fine though right? Angel snorted. \u2018F**king preppers.\u2019\u2018You have issues with them?\u2019\u2018Just when we pump their wells dry.\u2019 He laughed cynically. \u2018Never could figure out why people would think they could survive all out on their lonesome like that. All of them sitting in their little bunkers, thinking they\u2019re going to ride out the apocalypse alone.\u2019\u2018Maybe they watch too many old Westerns.\u2019\u2018Nobody survives on their own.\u2019 Angel\u2019s vehemence made Lucy suspect he wasn\u2019t really talking about preppers.\u201dThere is speculation in the book about the ability of Americans, even those that are not batshit crazy doomsday preppers, to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. \u201d...people are alone here in America. They\u2019re all alone. And they don\u2019t trust anyone except themselves, and they don\u2019t rely on anyone except themselves. He said that is why India would survive all this apocalyptic shit, but America wouldn\u2019t.\u201d We have become so fearful of co-dependency issues that we have become tribal units of one or in a best case scenario a tribe of immediate family. We are certainly vulnerable to catastrophe. I agree with those thoughts, but I also think we have always proven ourselves adaptable. The question will be will we change fast enough to save ourselves. \nNOAH an arcology system designed for New Orleans. In the book New Orleans collapses very early.Angel Velasquez has survived the water collapse. He was plucked out of prison by Catherine Case, who has become the most powerful woman in the West. She controls the Nevada water from her stronghold in Las Vegas. She builds arcology habitats that are self-sufficient for water and also for all the other needs of the residents. These lucky arcology people are isolated, living in a bubble, immune to the suffering and dying going on mere yards away from their habitat. They are not for people like you and me. We are merely: \u201dHuman spackle, filling the cracks of disaster.\u201dThe people living in these safe havens are very, very wealthy people. Angel is one of Case\u2019s most trusted Water Knives. He and other loyal hand-picked members go out and enforce her water rights, and ensure the continued Disneyland existence of her arcology residents. She makes towns die. Phoenix is next on her list. She dispatches Angel to Phoenix to see what is going on. Zona is up to their eyeballs in Texans and holy rollers. The city is coming apart at the seams. Coyotes are taking people\u2019s money to take them North and then executing them in the desert. Desperation colors everything and everyone. Bangbang girls (Texas teenagers) are prostituting themselves with wealthy executives just for an opportunity to take a shower and wash their clothes in a hotel. Who actually controls the water is being disputed. The man who had the papers with the ancient water rights (written on actual paper) has been mutilated, tortured, killed. The papers are in the wind, and it is Angel\u2019s job to get them back. He meets Lucy Monroe, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, who made her first mark writing Collapse Porn. The world couldn\u2019t get enough of all the scenes of degradation and death. They are an unlikely pair, but then Lucy has certainly become someone she didn\u2019t expect to be. Phoenix has changed her. \u201dPhoenix made people crazy\u2026. Sometimes it turned people into devils so bad they weren\u2019t recognizable as human. And other times it turned them into goddamn saints.\u201dShe was more saint than devil, but she couldn\u2019t deny that she had a bit too much of both to have much of a chance of surviving in a place where it is becoming apparent that no one is in charge. The whole city is going tribal. \u201dIt never rains in Phoenix, except when it\u2019s raining bodies.\u201dAlliances are changing and re-forming. Gut wrenching betrayals are making it hard for anyone to trust anyone. California is working against Las Vegas. Las Vegas is working against Phoenix. States are controlling their borders, keeping the parched refugees from the Southern states from invading. Everyone has spies gathering information that can mean the difference between a community flourishing or a community declining. Cadillac Desert has become a water Bible as people try to understand exactly what has happened to them and what is continuing to happen to them. \nIt is logical to cut off water to the rural areas when water becomes scarce. The problem is that it creates a food shortage. Land that is not being used for crops drys out and begins to blow creating massive, dangerous dust storms.This book is set in the near future. The plot of this novel could be the harbinger of a future prize winning work of nonfiction. The book gave me shivers because the possibilities of this becoming reality are all too probable. It is such a compulsive read that I read the last 220 pages in one sitting interrupted only by the need for a glass of water to parch the thirst the book inspired. Noir is hardboiled into the inflections of speech, into the scars, into the actions of the characters. Bodies pile up, massive dust storms blanket the city, and uncontrollable fires greedily eat up the dry tinder of abandoned buildings. Phoenix has become hell on Earth. Water has become something no one has enough of.

I mean, this is really all about the fate of whole cities and the struggle for every single person to survive the collapse when there just isn't enough to drink. I kept reaching for my water every few seconds just to make sure that I was okay.Truly. This is really good for what it is. Thriller, dystopia, commentary on human nature with things get really bad? Sure. It's all of that. But do you know what it is, really?It's a western. Not only that, it's a good western.Future SF, absolutely, but it has all the makings of some of the best westerns I've ever watched on TV. Who's the white hat, who's the black hat, watching the sharp as roles and situations reverse, the realization that you might have been rooting for the wrong guys and, possibly, the wrong reveals.I had a really good time reading this. It's not for the faint of heart or the dehydrated, although if you do want to add a little realism to your read, then by all means STOP DRINKING. Do you feel that headache coming on, the slightly euphoric sense of desperation? Amplify it.The novel might also be a commentary on water rights and the crazy lengths that anyone will go to secure them when water becomes more precious than gold, but more than that, it's a classic western worthy of Sergio Leone. :)"}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "Bacigalupi is On Point with this new thriller. This is the first book I've read this year that kept me compulsively turning the pages till way after my bedtime 'cause I absolutely needed to find out what was going to happen.It's a near-future sci-fi dystopia - however, I have to say that every time I updated my partner as to 'what I was reading about,' he kept saying, \"Umm, that's not science fiction, that's NOW.\"Well, the situation in the book is a little worse than 'now' - but it's the direction we're headed. Due to extreme water shortages in the American West, political fighting over water rights has gone to drastic measures, including military-style actions. States' borders have been closed, to halt the flood of water refugees fleeing a drying landscape. The wealthy 1% live in closed arcologies where everything is recycled and a 'normal' lifestyle is maintained - but the vast majority of the population is scraping by, reduced to drinking filtered pee and paying by the liter for water at 'gas station'-style pumps.Here we meet Lucy, a woman who's in a minority in Arizona because she's there by choice. A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist; she's covering the human side of the situation in the West - but she's gradually 'gone native' - making friends and becoming invested in the community.We also meet Angel - the title's 'water knife.' A mobster-style enforcer, he works for boss Catherine Case, the woman who ruthlessly controls the state's water supply.And then, there's Maria - a refugee from Texas who needs to scheme just as hard as Catherine Case ever has just to survive. The difference is; she's working for pennies, not billions.Lucy's always got her eye out for a story. Murder's not uncommon in this world, but now bodies are turning up in conjunction with rumors about some water rights being up for sale - rights which could overturn the existing order and power structure completely. While Lucy tries to find out what's really going on, others jockey for power and survival around her; desperation making strange bedfellows.The book's plot is somewhat standard for the genre, but is excellently paced, creating great tension. My one quibble is that an essential turning point of the plot hangs on one of our characters making a deduction that is really an intuitive leap of faith rather than a logical conclusion... but it's good enough that I'll forgive that one thing. The characters are clearly each picked to illustrate a different segment of society, but are all fully humanized - even the terrifyingly awful ones are all too believable. Overall, the book achieves the perfect balance of dealing insightfully with important and timely social, economic and environmental issues, while still providing a highly entertaining, keep-you-up-till-the-last-page story.Many, many thanks to Knopf and NetGalley for the opportunity to read this book by one of the most important writers currently publishing in this genre. As always, my opinion is solely my own.Best quote: \"If I could put my finger on the moment we genuinely fucked ourselves, it was the moment we decided that data was something you could use words like 'believe' or 'disbelieve' around.\""}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137566-kate", "userReview": "I got to the morgue scene (around page 120, in case there are several and this was only the first) and I'm stopping because I've fucking had enough. And here's why:\"Jamie's executioners had carved a story into his ruined flesh, and in the chill of the morgue...his torture stood out, intimate and nasty.\" Really? Tell me more -- j/k, don't. Really, please don't. \"Christine pointed with a rubber-gloved hand. 'Electrical burns on the genitals. Adrenaline injected into the body. Sings of trauma at the anus. Rape with blunt object.

The eyes were removed pre-mortem. Of the other body parts, only the hands and feet were removed pre-mortem. The legs and the rest happened after he was dead. It appears that there was some attempt to tourniquet the limbs and prolong life longer still.'\"I was willing to bear with this relentlessly dark story, but now I am not, because I have had enough of this shit. I'm guessing if you are a writer and you are not lazy, there are ways to raise the stakes, to make us afraid of your villains and convey that a situation is serious, without resulting to what is essentially torture porn. But especially in television and now, god help us, in books, these unspeakable acts and their attendant \"oh, isn't this horrible, here, smell it\" unveilings are reliable additions to the story, casually thrown in like you might add more salt to a sauce. If you were to believe our pop culture, humans do nothing but run around devising increasingly sinister ways to inflict pain on each other. When, in fact, what we do instead is run around looking for our next fix, for the next primetime drama or mystery/thriller that will give us a little thrill, a little peek at a person being hurt, nice and slow. Don't believe me? No, you do believe me. You can't dodge the evidence. Crime shows, cop shows, legal shows, all hunting for an excuse to show you someone duct-taped to a chair, sweating with fear. Even Scandal, a show that should be about political intrigue and excellent clothes, feels compelled to bust out its rusty torture toolbox almost every episode. And in books, the mysteries! Just check Publisher's Weekly. I could make a Mad Libs for these plot summaries: The corpse was discovered on the ______ with signs of a struggle, her _____ cut off and ______ carved into her _____. And yes, that corpse is usually a woman. Who was it proposed the theory that the Novel, perhaps by inspiring empathy in readers, has over the centuries curbed the incidence of wars and other violence? That's a nice theory. It's hard to believe it can hold in the face of this much glorification of creative suffering -- not just something horrible, but something horrible devised by another human in order to bring maximum pain. As we read these scenes, over and over again, I can't believe we become anything other than desensitized. All of our landscapes become hellscapes, with a psychopath lurking somewhere, toting a coil of rope and a selection of exacto knives. But we don't mind, we're used to it. I realize my complaints about escalation are similar to complaints about the escalation of sex in books and visual media. There is generally more sex now, and it's more graphic. The comparison is worth discussing. But most sex is a joyful thing, and this...\"Lucy leaned close, staring at his mangled face. He'd bitten off his own tongue.

I requested it -by choice - 'carefully'. I had a hunch it might be a challenge for me -- yet wanted to stretch my brain. Living in California with a clear memory of my first experience of a serious drought in the 70's -when I was living in Berkeley, Calif. (not flushing our toilets after each use wasn't pleasant for me as a young maiden in any shape of form). Plant stores closing was sad. Letting go of 'my' plants was sad. My little world -coming out of High School -just starting college -was 'already' a big adjustment.Now --our water supply was scarce....and I needed to 'man-up'! So..The plot premise of \"Water Knife\" was appealing to me. (we are also facing another drought right now in California). However, I struggled with this book for about the first 30%. It was 'over-my-head'. I felt insecure to what I was reading. I also couldn't get pass the choppers and the bureaucrat dedication to intentionally take out hundreds of thousands of people. I kept saying to myself..Who in their right mind, could sleep at night, with such a job? Whole cities were being destroyed....and I felt helpless 'reading' this book...Then I remembered THIS is a FICTION story....(I had too)... I was feeling a little sick. --My personal feelings at the start was 'this is crazy'. I didn't understand any of the 'statistics', and felt frustrated. (but then I figured I could let that go).At some point this novel did a complete change. \"about 30% in\"! WOW.....It became a page-turning chilling-thriller ride. By now, I was getting numb (somewhat) to the disturbing -vividly graphic descriptive horrific torture (I had to --in order to keep sane)....but I couldn't stop reading either.I'll say this. I've never in my life read a more graphic book of violence -murder -and torture. The characters --ALL of them --are developed well. The Water War was on. The characters each generated 'heat & power' .... personalities that felt real on and off the battlefield. I had two favorite characters: Angel and Lucy. Given their rolls in the book, I wondered if the author had chosen their names with a purpose. I'm guessing he might have.The name Angel (his job was to cut water supplies) -- means \"Messenger of God\" The holly messenger.The name Lucy (the journalist) --means \"Light\" & \"Clarity\". This book goes to the core of many ardent tensions in our troubled modernity."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "4.5 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.com/2015/06/09/a...In this day and age where one can\u2019t even walk into a bookstore\u2019s sci-fi section without a few dozen dystopian titles getting thrown in your face, I have to say Paolo Bacigalupi\u2019s The Water Knife really impacted me in a big way. It put me in mind of an eccentric high school teacher I once had, who was a little obsessed with doomsday scenarios. He used to be fond of saying that if the civilizations were to crumble or if the whole world were to go to war, it wouldn\u2019t be over things like a pandemic or nuclear war. No, it would be for water \u2013 fresh, drinkable water without which none of us can survive.Indeed, Bacigalupi paints a rather bleak, hellish picture of a place where water is scarce and more valuable than gold, a resource for which people are willing to kill and destroy. Drought has ravaged the American Southwest, changing the physical and political landscape. States like Nevada and Arizona clash viciously over shares of the Colorado River while bigwig California looks on, and states like Texas and New Mexico have long since given up the ghost. Las Vegas employs mercenaries like Angel Velasquez as \u201cWater Knives\u201d, hired to \u201ccut\u201d water for the Southern Nevada Water Authority and its boss, Catherine Case. This ensures continued survival for her lush arcology developments in the hot desert, where the rich luxuriate in cushy comfort while elsewhere cities like Phoenix dry up and stagnate for lack of water.This book follows Angel as he travels to Phoenix to investigate rumors of a new water source for his boss. The story is told through two other perspectives, including a journalist named Lucy Monroe, as well as a young Texan refugee named Maria Villarosa. Desperate and destitute folk like Maria are struggling to make a living in the city while dreaming of one day having enough money to escape north. Lucy, on the other hand, could have left any time she pleased, but years of living in Phoenix has led her to adopt it as her home, and you get a sense that she\u2019d do what she can to try to help the city. When it appears that California is finally making its move to monopolize the river, Angel, Lucy and Maria end up coming together in a precarious alliance to stop a conspiracy and secure a future for the people of Phoenix.There are many unsettling themes in this book, and not least of all because the scarcity of potable water is a reality for many people in the world. Talk of droughts in California and in the American Southwest in the news today makes The Water Knife seem less like science fiction and more like a commentary on current issues. If seeing pictures of the immaculate green lawns and freshly filled-pools of the rich and famous during a drought make your blood boil, then this book will take that fury to a whole new level. It\u2019s really hard to read about this divided America where characters like Maria were driven out of Texas after their water got shut off, only to be treated like interlopers when they have no choice but to migrate to Arizona. Girls like Maria\u2019s friend Sarah turn to prostitution as a last resort, servicing those wealthy corporate types for whom a single shower may use up more water than a poor person in Phoenix might see in an entire week. Then to rub salt in the wound, the girls\u2019 money gets taken away by the local gangsters, never allowing anyone a fair shot to work themselves out of this nightmarish situation. There\u2019s a lot in this book that\u2019s hard to take.It\u2019s also heavy on graphic violence, descriptions of torture both during and after the act, and generally features many scenes of groups of people doing terrible, unspeakable things to other groups of people. If you are squeamish about such things, you should probably go in prepared to read some pretty sick stuff. To the book\u2019s credit, while there\u2019s certainly no shortage of examples in here when it comes humanity\u2019s lowest moments, there are nonetheless many instances of characters stepping up to show an extraordinary amount of bravery and compassion. Despite being categorized as a sci-fi thriller, The Water Knife is also a very human story, where characters are intimately touched by plot events as well as the lives of other people.The book isn\u2019t exactly a light read, even in the audiobook format I listened to, with its heavy themes and also some parts which are quite drawn out with descriptions. But for all their lengthiness, I think I have these sections to thank for making the world of The Water Knife one of the most detailed and fleshed out dystopians I\u2019ve read. Southwestern America has reverted back to a kind of wildness, a melting pot of disparate rhythms and cultures where Red Cross aid workers, rich Chinese businessmen, underworld crooks, poverty-stricken refugees, sensationalist media journalists, religious evangelists, and dangerous mercenaries all commingled together in a dying city. This also makes the audiobook of The Water Knife worth experiencing, as narrator Almarie Guerra delivers a performance filled with a great variety of accents and voices, and it\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard.This is the first book by Paolo Bacigalupi I\u2019ve ever read, but if this is the kind of originality and well-rounded quality I can expect from his writing, it certainly won\u2019t be the last. I really enjoyed The Water Knife, and I look forward to checking out the author\u2019s previous work as well as his future books."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "Amazing, thrilling and carrying a great vocabulary, The Water Knife is both original and full of imagination."}, {"userName": "Boris", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11501632-boris", "userReview": "\u0412\u0438\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u0437\u0438 \u0442\u044a\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043d\u0438\u043c\u043a\u0430? \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 2011 \u0433. \u0432 \u0422\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0443\u0448\u0430. \u0422\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0449\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0443\u0448\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u0437\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0438 \u0435 \u0441\u044a\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u044a\u043a \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0439\u0442\u043e \u0449\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0437\u0432\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0434 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u0447\u0438\u0432\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0438.\u0413\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044a\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435 -

Who would believe this awful fantasy? People wouldn't behave like these characters! The United States would never fall apart, each state operating as if they don't have to listen to the Federal government, or citizens forget we are all Americans!This is a terrible novel of a fictionalized future about the dying city of Phoenix, Arizona in a water-starved Western United States. It is a waste of time to read! Really! Who would believe that Nevada, Arizona, Texas and California would struggle as adversaries in a water war, committing murder over water rights to the Colorado River? Or that civilized Americans would act like competing predatory animals to survive because of drought conditions? That here in America, hunger and thirst would drive mass numbers of ordinary people to desperate emigrations, despite being made illegal by neighboring state laws? Or that people would sell themselves and their families to business interests or criminal gangs for drinking water, and no one lucky enough to live in neighboring states with water would help? That the Federal Government would be helpless because the states would tie up the government's weakened hands in legal court battles fighting over senior water rights given in treaties and contracts signed in the 19th and 20th centuries? That each state involved would build fences manned by private contractors and police to keep American refugees out of their resource-strained states? What drivel! This book's premise is beyond belief! People living and slowly dying in the wrecked, dry, dust-diseased, hungry city of Phoenix, Arizona, because Nevada and California conspires to cut off Arizona's water? Come on! This is simply too too big of a stretch of imagination! Pshaw! Droughts? Underground reservoirs running dry because of over-pumping? Business ventures using cutthroat underhanded, illegal methods to gain legal water rights? Water costing as much as gold?And what complete poppycock it is to study history - the past behavior, selfishness and pretended ignorance of our parents is not relevant to our current stewardship. History doesn't matter. Moronic trashtalk by a bunch of sissy scientist worrywarts is nothing WE can do anything about anyway! These dust-storms and hurricanes and droughts and other weather-related disasters are temporary conditions! And America does take care of its own! We are committed to a strong united America! Love it or Leave It! Manifest Destiny! I Have a Dream! And we are committed to being Americans, not just Nevadans (All for our Country - The Silver State), Texans (Friendship - The Lone Star State), or Californians (I Have Found It or Eureka - The Golden State), or Arizonians (God Enriches - The Grand Canyon State)! Don't Mess with Texas! Home of the Brave! Don't Tread on Me! Of the People, By the People, For the People! Read my Lips, No New Taxes! The Feds will fix everything, besides. Even if historically only the rich and politically connected got the federal wink and nod occasionally....and the states would NEVER, and have never in the past, fought each other bloody over a silly resource thing like water, which everyone knows flows forever in our rivers and lakes, fed by endless Spring rainfall and god's blessings! All we have to do is ignore it. It isn't our problem anyway. Our grandkids will have to worry about it, not us...California Water Wars: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calif...LA Times article dated 6/29/15, \"Lawsuits over California Water Rights are a Fight a Century in the Making\": http://www.latimes.com/local/californ...Arizona Daily Star Newspaper, \"Is California trying to Take Our Water?\" article http://tucson.com/news/local/is-calif..., copied below:June 27, 2015 7:29 pm \u2022 By Tony DavisRepublican Gov. Doug Ducey and Democratic Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva don\u2019t agree on much, but both worry California could take Arizona\u2019s water.The conservative governor and the liberal congressman say Arizona must be vigilant to ensure its drought-parched neighbor doesn\u2019t use federal action to grab some of Arizona\u2019s Colorado River supply.Of particular concern is a California drought bill that\u2019s been quietly negotiated for months in the U.S. Senate.\u201cThe secrecy generates concern and nervousness. Nobody I know in Arizona knows what\u2019s in this bill at this point,\u201d says Chuck Cullom, who manages Colorado River issues for the Central Arizona Project, the canal system that brings the river water to Phoenix, Tucson, tribes and farms.The two states have fought over water many times, and any threat from giant California has always been a potent Arizona rallying cry. California, after all, has much more political clout: 53 members in the House of Representatives compared to Arizona\u2019s nine. And California\u2019s water situation is much worse than Arizona\u2019s, which has done far more than its neighbor over the years to conserve water and prepare for shortages.That\u2019s why Democratic Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton added his voice to the concerns a few days ago, saying in Washington, D.C., that his city must be ready for a fight with California.But outside Arizona, this view is disputed by many water experts. Four say Arizona has no reason to worry about a California water grab. It\u2019s \u201cludicrous\u201d to suggest California could undo the historic contract divvying up Colorado River water that was signed by seven governors and the president, says Patricia Mulroy, a researcher who used to run Las Vegas\u2019 water utility. And so far, Arizona officials have offered no evidence California even plans to make a run at our water.Still, when Tucson water conservation activist Val Little heard California\u2019s governor proclaim emergency water cutbacks this year, her first thought was: Anything bad that happens to California is a threat to Arizona.\u201cThings are so unknown, on the tipping point and on the edge, that anything can happen,\u201d said Little, director of the Water Conservation Alliance of Southern Arizona.FORCED TO CUT BACKHistory shows Arizona has reason to worry about California.In 1922, Arizona balked at signing the Colorado River Compact splitting water among the seven river basin states because it felt California got too much.In 1934 came the abortive effort by Arizona Gov. Benjamin Moeur to stop construction of Parker Dam on the river by calling out the Arizona National Guard. He felt \u2014 rightly, it turned out \u2014 that the dam would be a conduit, siphoning river water to Los Angeles.Even after Arizona signed the compact in 1944, California kept arguing it had the legal right to more water than Arizona believed it did. California blocked approval of the Central Arizona Project at every turn for nearly 25 years.Then came the landmark Arizona vs. California court case, which the U.S. Supreme Court decided in Arizona\u2019s favor in 1963. It found Arizona had rights to 2.8 million acre feet of river water it had long claimed. California was awarded 4.4 million, although it was using much more.In 1968, when Congress finally authorized the CAP, California\u2019s political muscle forced Arizona\u2019s delegation to give California first priority and the CAP last priority to river water during any shortage.Even into the early 2000s, California was using far more than its 4.4 million acre feet. The Interior Department had to prod the state into finally cutting back.\u201cWE MUST BE VIGILANT\u201dDucey first raised the latest specter of a California water grab during a water policy speech in Tempe on June 9.\u201cWe must be vigilant as we deal with the federal government to address these issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to impress upon them what Arizona has already done with water \u2026 so their actions to aid California don\u2019t reduce Arizona\u2019s flexibility or ability to manage our own water.\u201cThere should be no fallout from the water situation that might limit or affect Arizona by the Interior secretary. Arizona already takes the lion\u2019s share of Colorado River shortages.\u201dIf California did covet Arizona\u2019s Colorado River water, experts say it would take a congressional act to get it, because the Interior Department couldn\u2019t overturn the 1922 compact or the Supreme Court ruling.While Congress hasn\u2019t dealt much with water rights issues since 1968, Grijalva agrees it\u2019s time to be vigilant \u2014 especially of the powerful Imperial Valley Irrigation District west of Yuma. But the Tucson congressman says he has no knowledge that a water grab is forthcoming.\u201cWith the extreme drought in California, the fact remains that the Colorado River does become a target to relieve central California and the Imperial Valley farms, agribusiness,\u201d Grijalva said. \u201cI think we need to be very conscious of that and be prepared to fight that.\u201dAlthough a water grab wouldn\u2019t float through Congress easily, \u201cas the political and drought situation gets more intense there, you know California will look at more and more sources,\u201d Grijalva added.The California drought relief bill is being drawn up under the direction of Sen. Dianne Feinstein of that state. Her press secretary, Tom Mentzer, didn\u2019t respond to questions from the Star about the bill.Although no California water officials have exerted direct pressure on Arizona, \u201cwe\u2019ve heard California water managers say Arizona can take deeper shortages over the years because we have so much groundwater,\u201d said the CAP\u2019s Cullom.The fear is that California would pressure the Interior secretary to force Arizona to use more groundwater so California could take more river water, he said.Californians also point out that Arizona has about 9 million acre-feet of Colorado River water stored underground for times of shortage. That\u2019s enough to serve roughly 18 million households for a year. Officials here counter that Arizona shouldn\u2019t be punished for saving water for the future.At a D.C. panel discussion held last week by The Washington Post, Stanton said Phoenix must be ready to \u201cfight to protect our water rights.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying \u2026 that whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting over,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cWe hope not to get to that point, but we\u2019d better get ready in case.\u201dWith California\u2019s drought hitting unprecedented levels, Arizona must be a part of any conversations about water in this region, Stanton said in a follow-up interview.\u201cWe want to make sure, first and foremost, that we protect what our forefathers were able to get for us,\u201d he said.CALIFORNIA HOLDS CARDSOutside experts say a California water grab is unlikely.The 242-mile California Aqueduct that brings in river water to Southern California\u2019s six-county Metropolitan Water District has no room for more water, said Bill Hasencamp, the district\u2019s Colorado River resource manager. The aqueduct already carries the district\u2019s own allocation, plus extra that it\u2019s bought from Southern California farming districts as well as water it set aside in Lake Mead years ago to use in droughts, he said.Controversy over such a bill would explode across the West, with other river basin states taking Arizona\u2019s side, fearful of setting a precedent for future grabs, said Douglas Kenney, a University of Colorado water policy researcher.Environmentalists would also gear up to fight California on any such move, said Joan Clayburgh of the group Western Resource Advocates and Jennifer Pitt of the Environmental Defense Fund.Collaboration between the states and between the U.S. and Mexico has helped Colorado River management for 15 years, increasing the reliability of everyone\u2019s water supply, while starting to solve some of the river\u2019s worst environmental problems, said Pitt, the fund\u2019s Colorado River program director. \u201cCreating winners and losers threatens that progress.\u201dMost importantly, California already holds all the cards on water due to the 1968 CAP law, said Kenney and water researchers John Fleck in New Mexico and Brad Udall in Colorado.While Arizona worries about a theoretical risk from California, it actually should be more concerned about ongoing efforts by Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming to build dams and other projects that would take more Colorado River water this state uses, said Kenney. Those states are targeting unused water they already have the legal rights to.California has the most to lose if the Colorado River compact issue goes back to Congress, said Fleck, who is writing a book on river management that\u2019s scheduled to be published next year by Island Press.\u201cIf anyone has an incentive to break these deals, it\u2019s you guys\u201d in Arizona,\u201d said Fleck, a writer for the University of New Mexico\u2019s water resources program.Mulroy, a Brookings Institution researcher, says for Arizona \u201cto beat the war drums\u201d against California will drive \u201ceven the moderate voices in that state into the bunkers,\u201d which could backfire. She\u2019s concerned that Arizona\u2019s rhetoric could disrupt ongoing negotiations among the seven river-basin states to prevent Lake Mead from dropping to dangerously low levels.Brad Udall\u2019s father, the late U.S. Rep. Morris Udall, spent nearly 30 years getting the CAP canal built to cover the 336 miles from the river to Tucson, where it now provides our drinking water.Now, Brad Udall says California essentially owns the rights to Arizona\u2019s CAP water due to the 1968 agreement that his father and uncle, then-Interior Secretary Stewart Udall, signed off on.As the agreement stands, Arizona will lose all its CAP water once river shortages happen before California loses any of its 4.4 million acre-feet.So California might not want to fight over Arizona\u2019s CAP rights because when the shortages start in a few years \u2014 due to drought and over-allocation \u2014 the rights won\u2019t be worth much.By going after Arizona\u2019s CAP water, said Brad Udall, a Colorado State University research scientist, \u201cCalifornia gets nothing at this point.\u201dSPOILER - the ending sucks...."}, {"userName": "Heather *Awkward Queen and Unicorn Twin*", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256869-heather-awkward-queen-and-unicorn-twin", "userReview": "2.5 stars.The only reason I read this was because it's set partly in Las Vegas. And the subject matter terrifies me. Yes, it's true. I'm terrified of having to move away from my home one day because there isn't enough water to go around, and take up residence in a state that has income tax and summers with highs below 100 degrees.Okay, but seriously, I am really scared of the water thing. I read a book about the early years of Las Vegas as we know it today, and even back then, water was a concern. The Mob indiscriminately used up tons of water from the city's aquifer with no plans to replace it. Only in recent years have we begun taking steps to conserve seriously. If someone has grass in their yard instead of desert landscaping or dirt, you know they're an asshole.This book's version of the future in the Southwest was so much more frightening than I could imagine and I want no part of it. Nope. None.So, the author was effective in creating this dry, ruthless, hellish landscape where people die a lot, mostly from getting shot or tortured because reasons. However, there was something about the writing that pissed me off. It was technically competent, but kind of awkward nonetheless. Every time the characters spoke to each other, their dialogue was full of Meaning and Lessons and The Way Things Used to Be and The Way Things Are Now. Also the author was like, \"Hey! Look how many Life Metaphors I can cram in here!\"Not enjoyable, I tell you.It took a while to get into the story. And by a while, I mean like the last 100 pages. And then it got boring again. And then it ended.If you're interested in the subject matter, I think this is worth a read. Especially if you live in the Southwest.

The set-up is very long \u2013 over 30% of the book \u2013 but it was well worth the effort to get through it.The reality portrayed in The Water Knife reveals the consequences of [so-called] climate change and the resulting water scarcity on the American Southwest. The author, with his limitless imagination, creates a sad, violence-ridden world abounding in colorful detail, in sharp contrast to the bleak desert landscape that dominates the story. And this is what makes this book so impressive: the world building. There is enough of the familiar to make it real. We\u2019ve all read or heard the current news about the years-long drought that California and other states are suffering through, the dust storms plaguing Phoenix, and the legal battles gearing up over water rights between the states of the American southwest, the states in the southern plains, and various other entities such as American Indian tribes. (There is a near constant stream of television commercials about the water rights of the tribes here in Oklahoma; the rhetoric from both sides is simply amazing to hear.)Prolonged drought, the draining of the aquifers, and violent political winds have combined to return most of the desert southwest back into its natural form, while the states of the Eastern seaboard, the Gulf Coast, and the Midwest are succumbing to the rising sea levels, monster hurricanes, and severe tornadic storms that dwarf anything previously known in American history. A weakened federal government has caved to demands that the states be permitted to forcibly close their borders, which now use National Guard and local militias to violently prevent entry into their state.Mr. Bacigalupi has an exceptional talent of creating characters that are complex and believable. The \u201cwater knife\u201d \u2014 a hit man who cuts off water to farms, towns, and cities \u2014 is a tough, clever Mexican immigrant who works for Catherine Case, the powerful ruler of the Southern Nevada Water District. Using a small army of thugs, she has channeled most of the water of the Colorado River into Las Vegas, when she has built massive vertical towns that are virtually self-contained. In these privileged communities, thousands of wealthy people live in luxury unknown to the rest of the population.Angel\u2019s boss sends him to Phoenix to further solidify her hold on the waters of the Colorado River. In the course of his dirty work, his path intersects with a teenage refugee from Texas, and an investigative reporter who is pursuing the story of Arizona\u2019s water politics at great risk to her life. The intertwined stories of these three characters form the core of this extremely well-written novel.The depth of the characters is what one would expect in such an example--actually a pretty superior example--of \u201cafter-the-collapse-apocalypse-fiction\u201d -- a sub-genre becoming increasingly formulaic. The Water Knife describes people increasingly on edge, people in trouble, and twisted people who take advantage of the chaos to create their own tyrannical kingdoms. The violence is explicit, and may be disturbing to some readers. There\u2019s explicit sex, too. This is a book for adults, period. This book is about what is in today\u2019s headlines, leaving the reader to wonder and worry about its predictive value like readers have done with 1984, Brave New World, and Atlas Shrugged, among others.Paolo Bacigalupi is among the most gifted of current science fiction writers. His best-known work, The Windup Girl, is a masterpiece of the imagination, painting a picture of a grim, far-future reality of GMOs that illuminates the world in which we now live. The Water Knife is as equally compelling, another look at the potential future of our world, and is highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Andrew Lennon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6115193-andrew-lennon", "userReview": "The beginning of this book was a bit slow moving.

The book's three main characters are solidly developed: Angel, a Mexican \"Water Knife\"/ghost employed by a privatized company to ensure water access to the 1%-ers of Las Vegas, by any means necessary; Lucy Monroe, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist working in Phoenix documenting the death of the city; and Maria Villarosa, a young orphaned Texas refugee who hustles schemes to make money.

I hadn't heard much buzz about this book, but I had heard the author's name and it has been sat on my shelf for a fair while actually. I finally was prompted to pick it up becuase I joined a book club and this was their choice for this month's book. I'm really glad that I did go for it, because I was pleasantly surprised by just how much I enjoyed it.This follows a near-future world where water has become quite a rarity. Big corporations created by private investors have taken over control of the water and aqueducts, and this means that many gangs have formed to back these various leaders. The world is far from what it once was. Paying through the roof just to get water to survive, and living rough becuase the rest of the world also hasn't been going so strong, well, it's tough. We follow three major characters: - Angel - A water Knife who's essentially a PI and assassin for a charming (not really) lady called Catherine Case. She's a big investor in water and the leader of an extremely dangerous and fraught gang who are controlling much of the resources near to Phoenix, Vegas and California. - Maria - A woman who's living life rough. She's trying to scrape by on selling water to people at the local market, but she's got barely any family/friends left and those she does have are mixed up in criminal activity and sex work.- Lucy - A reporter who is working in Phoenix covering the crazy loss of life and immense poverty. She's kind of trapped there thanks to border control enforcement, and she's trying her best to stay afloat and report real news, but it's a hard gig to work. When these three characters all get caught up in a conspiracy over water rights they have to figure out what's going on and who has the rights as fast as possible before they all end up dead. In fact, the pacing of this book felt entirely dramatic throughout and I found myself getting drawn ever deeper into the storyline. Overall, I was pleasantly (if brutally) surprised by the harsh but thoughtful look at this dystopian future. It's definitely not a world I would wish to live in, but it's a world that is scarily possible and quite devastating to contemplate. The action and intensity of the story kept a driving force throughout, and I found I did connect with and enjoy the characters and their lives even though I've never experienced any of the many horrors they encounter.

I like to say I\u2019m a semi-reformed literature snob\u2014that is, I don\u2019t like partitioning books into genres, but sometimes they are convenient labels for discussion and critique. Now, I\u2019ve read some good thrillers in my time. But The Water Knife is definitely one of the best I\u2019ve read.It\u2019s the near future, and water shortages have devastated the American Southwest. Think Mad Max: Fury Road without the Max. Or the fury. But plenty of mad roads. Like, mad people \u2026 on dusty \u2026 never mind; I haven\u2019t even seen that movie, so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m really getting the comparison right. Next paragraph!Paolo Bacigalupi\u2019s other near-future eco-thriller \nThe Windup Girl\n is notable for how he deals with the dominance of corporations that produce GMOs, and the way we are failing to manage the planet\u2019s biosphere. For The Water Knife, Bacigalupi narrows the scope a little bit. This is less a global problem (although global warming is obviously behind it) and more a regional one. Mismanagement of the aquifers west of the Mississipi mean that entire states and millions of people are living in desert, third-world conditions. We get the sense that the eastern United States is, much like our glimpse of Vancouver, B.C., not as badly affected. This is a localized issue that has nevertheless torn the United States apart.I want to emphasize that last part, and at the same time I want to highlight that this is not a post-apocalyptic book. No huge disaster wiped out those good ol\u2019 United States. This is the prelude to the apocalypse, the long, slow rearranging of the deck chairs while everyone blames everyone else, tries to steal everyone else\u2019s water, and generally continues to ignore the problem. Florida would be doing the same thing, except I imagine Florida is largely underwater in this book, as it will be in reality in decades.It\u2019s tempting for those of us who have led sheltered lives to believe that no matter how bad it gets elsewhere in the world, we are somehow safe. That these walls and the social niceties cushioning us can\u2019t come crashing down. I\u2019m not saying they necessarily will. But part of the reason The Water Knife works so well is because it feels true. It\u2019s not what will happen, but it\u2019s what could happen. Because it\u2019s very similar to how our world is now: the rich use their money to insulate themselves from upheaval while the middle class become poor and the poor get dead.In the midst of this, I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to like any of the main characters. Angel is technically a \u201cbad guy\u201d in the sense that he is a mercenary (albeit one who is \u201cgoing soft\u201d in his own words). Lucy seemed like a generic journalist at first. And while Maria\u2019s story is heart-wrenching, I was so saddened by the string of bad fortune she experiences that I almost couldn\u2019t keep reading. I thought to myself, \u201cBacigalupi is not going to let her off the hook here; this is not going to end well for her.\u201dThis is a bleak book. My friend Rob over at Random Comments examines this from several angles. In particular, I agree that the ending\u2014which is actually a \u201chappy ending\u201d from the perspective of at least some of our characters\u2014betrays a deeper cynicism than it might otherwise appear to have. In particular, Bacigalupi seems to be saying that realism and self-interest is the only route towards survival in this wasteland. In that desert show-off, Angel is poised to be an angel\u2014but he can only act as such after one of the characters gives him the opportunity by shooting another.Bacigalupi also channels William Gibson in the way he weaves this possible near-future. He\u2019s got the lingo down: \u201cwater knife\u201d and \u201ccutting\u201d to talk about rerouting or otherwise obtaining water from another reservoir; \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cZoner\u201d as pejorative terms. These are great from a narrative standpoint, because they make the world feel more authentic. But, like Gibson, Bacigalupi has the ability to make this world fit like a strange glove you never knew you owned. Catherine Case (who, in another life, might have become a Marvel superhero) is much like businesspeople who exist today. Gibson\u2019s work is so powerful because he draws upon threads that already exist, plucks them from the quotidian, and rotates and remixes them until they become noticeable, troubling, and bizarre in how real they nevertheless feel.Because even though cyberspace cowboys or water knives might never actually exist, the people who inhabit these roles already do. As we change our planet and our societies shift, crumble, and reform in response, we don\u2019t see the emergence of new types of people, just new structures for them to inhabit. With Angel, Lucy, and Maria, Bacigalupi demonstrates how these structures oppress even those who appear to have some kind of power. At one point, Angel tells Lucy he believes people are basically the same, and that circumstances dictate who they become: grow up with a silver spoon and you\u2019re a doctor; grow up in the hood, and you join a gang. Bacigalupi parallels this with Damien in Maria\u2019s story, and how he seems to have more of a conscience than those higher up in the gang\u2019s ranks\u2014but that\u2019s not enough to give him courage.This self-reinforcing style of writing is powerful, and it\u2019s why The Water Knife is a damn good thriller. You want action and shoot-em-up? It\u2019s in here too. There\u2019s politicking and conniving. Terrible situations where men and women are forced to compromise their ethics for the sake of survival. People driven the breaking point\u2014and beyond. And man, it is depressing. But it\u2019s also so very good."}, {"userName": "Fred Hughes", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7119280-fred-hughes", "userReview": "A great story about potentially what our world could be like after our water starts to run out.

Bangkok\u2019s sea walls. The giant beasts being used to wind up energy coils. Calories as currency. Agricultural corporatocracy. Mutated GMOs running amok. For all its faults, The Windup Girl evoked a climate changed future in a way that I\u2019d never encountered up to that point. It felt real and perilous and in many ways kind of wonderful and beautiful, like some glittering dragon rearing up, moments before it annihilates you with its fiery exhalation.In The Water Knife, Bacigalpui\u2019s talent for world-building remains intact. The book is set in southwest United States, in a future where drought has made water scarcity the prime issue of the time. Plumbing has become non-existent, so vehicular porta-potties called Jonnytrucks travel around, collecting people\u2019s wastes so as to reclaim their water. Most people carry around a \u2018Clearsac,\u2019 which can filter urine on the fly. The wealthy elite either move north where there\u2019s more water or live in Arcologies, these massive condo complexes designed to be self-sustaining with a genetically customized indoor ecosystem that is able to filter and re-use 99.9999% of water (I visualized them as something like the Opryland Hotel). The poorest, however, cluster around Red Cross sponsored Charity Pumps, where they can buy their water one liter at a time. It all seems real and well-considered, but whereas the world of The Windup Girl felt exotic and interesting, this one feels far more oppressive. Despair, thirst, anarchy pervades everything.Meanwhile, the geopolitical landscape has changed considerably.Texas has become all but inhospitable, so that the word \u2018Texan\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018Refugee.\u2019 In fact, the United States has become rather more like the \u2018Dis-United States\u2019, so that every state strives against every other state in a battle royale to secure sources of water. California, in particular, plays the role of the nemesis. It\u2019s never really explained why, but they pretty much do what they want when it comes to water. Still, the Federal government looms over all, as a sort of boogeyman. It\u2019s occasionally trotted out as this, \u201cWell we individual states have to be careful to avoid OBVIOUS conflict \u2013 or else the federal government will send in the troops.\u201dActually, this role of the Federal government is probably the weakest aspect of the plot, which involves a MacGuffin of the highest order. Basically, \u2018legal\u2019 access to water involves one entity demonstrating that it has \u2018senior\u2019 water rights. So if California can show that they have a \u2018legal\u2019 claim that predates Nevada\u2019s claim to, e.g., Lake Tahoe, then they get first dibs on that water. Well, The Water Knife is set primarily in Phoenix, Arizona \u2013 which is running perilously low on water \u2013 and revolves around the discovery of some SUPER OLD & therefore \u2018senior\u2019 water rights. But in order for that to mean anything, there must be some larger federal apparatus to enforce them, i.e. the federal government. But we NEVER see the federal government in the book. EVER. So the world-building \u2013 insofar as its ability to evoke a real and tangible culture of water scarcity \u2013 is great. But the world-building when it comes to believable, yet thrilling plot mechanics is a little less impressive.The BadHave you ever seen Red Letter Media\u2019s review of The Phantom Menace? It\u2019s great (if bizarre). Well, anyway, at one point, he challenges people to describe the characters in the early Star Wars versus the later Star Wars. Without referring to their costume, looks, profession, or role in the story. In other words, describe their personality. So I\u2019m gonna do that with Water Knife\u2019s three Point of View characters.The titular \u2018Water Knife\u2019 Angel: He\u2019s an ex-con, so he\u2019s um tough. Book constantly describes him as tough. Definitely a psychopath. But he\u2019s very trusting? Well, not really. Selectively trusting. Are tough people trusting or are they cynical? He\u2019s not really cynical though, not like other hardboiled protags. In some ways, he\u2019s almost childlike. Rationally, he\u2019s very clearly an evil person, but the book struggles to paint him in a sympathetic light. So\u2026 not sure.Maria, the Texan teenager: She\u2019s na\u00efve. Except she\u2019s got a friend & roommate, Sarah, who is Maria\u2019s foil and is really na\u00efve. So Maria is supposed to be clever. A survivor. But she follows up her cleverness with dumbness. She\u2019s a teenager \u2013 even though I had to be told that she was one to realize it \u2013 and I think ultimately she\u2019s meant to represent the corruption of innocence, or of the innocent worldview, anyway. But that\u2019d be describing her role, not her character. So maybe she\u2019s not na\u00efve, but optimistic, and that optimism rots away throughout the book.Lucy, the New England journalist: She\u2019s a thrill-seeker in denial. And ummm\u2026 she has a dog? Yep, the author did actually use the ol\u2019 \u201cgive a character a pet to make em sympathetic\u201d trick. Classic! I\u2019m tempted to call Lucy \u2018brave\u2019 but really she\u2019s just stubborn, like a good journalist. Won\u2019t let the story go, follows it to the end. She\u2019s from New England (which still has water) but has sorta gone native since coming to Arizona to work. Ostensibly, she\u2019s a force for good but doesn\u2019t really stick by those convictions. So a realist maybe? But not really. Idealism motivates her pretty heavily. So\u2026 not sure again?So I wouldn\u2019t say the characterization is terrible. Certainly not Star Wars prequels quality, but I found it pretty lackluster. Angel, in particular, is wholly unsatisfying as the leading man. It\u2019s really difficult to write a sympathetic psychopath, and I don\u2019t think Bacigalupi succeeds. Angel comes across as inconsistent rather than complex. One minute he\u2019s remorseless about condemning a whole city to death by thirst, the next he\u2019s risking his neck to help out a rando stranger. One minute he\u2019ll be highly paranoid, the next he\u2019ll be in la la land. I found Lucy to be very bland and while I liked Maria, she\u2019s involved in this whole gang subplot that ends up going nowhere.I think that while Bacigalupi is a master at imagining and describing a milieu, he struggles to populate it with worthwhile characters.The (future) uglyIf you\u2019re just interested in the book, you can stop reading now, as this is about the reality of some of Bacigalupi\u2019s ideas.At first, I was tempted to talk about Climate Change and how perplexing I find it. Coz I mean, we\u2019ve been having this debate about whether it\u2019s \u201cman-made.\u201d But does that even matter? Not really. Fact: climate is changing. Fact: this changing climate is effing us up currently (see: death toll from heat waves in India) and is gonna continue to eff us up even more. We\u2019ve designed our civilization to work within certain climate parameters, so it\u2019s really not good if they change too quickly or drastically. So if humankind wasn\u2019t already having an effect on the climate, then we better start having one. I mean it\u2019s an EXISTENTIAL CRISIS. We could possibly GO EXTINCT. Maybe just maybe that\u2019s not something we should mess around with?But honestly, what\u2019d be the point? If you don\u2019t take it seriously yet, some rando guy talking about it in a book review isn\u2019t going to have an effect.Instead, let\u2019s return to the idea of a Dis-United States because I want to ponder whether that\u2019s a thing that\u2019s possible. I\u2019d say, Yes, it\u2019s about as possible as Britain exiting the EU, and to explain why I want to talk about The Beatles! Yep, The Beatles. When they played in 1965 at Shea Stadium, NY Times described it thusly, \u201c\u2026immature lungs [of their fans] produced a sound so staggering, so massive, so shrill and sustained that it crossed the line from enthusiasm into hysteria and soon it was in the area of the classic Greek meaning of the word pandemonium\u2014the region of the demons.\u201d Love that description. I wasn\u2019t alive back then, but my mother tells me that EVERYONE listened to The Beatles. Maybe not everyone went as wild as the above fans, but they were a cultural phenomenon. But it\u2019s one that\u2019s never going to be repeated because the way we find and access music has fragmented the musical landscape. There are so many sources to find your music \u2013 and so many ways for a band to monetize their sound \u2013 that now everyone can find a hundred different bands fitting their exact desired musical aesthetic. You (by which I particularly mean Americans) can get exactly what you want in music, and that\u2019s true of everything else now. TV, movies, video games, news, type of food, social contacts, etc. We all get to be very picky. For example, there are between 600k to 1 million books published a year in the US. Meanwhile, in 1865, there were only something like 10k books published in France, leading to the cultural phenomenon of The Count of Monte Cristo, which was read by EVERYONE (in Paris, at least), much like The Beatles was listened to by EVERYONE.So we\u2019ve become accustomed to being able to have things our way, without needing to compromise. Well, why not government? Already anti-establishment politicians are growing in popularity throughout the western world. How long until we say, why bother with a federal government? They don\u2019t fit me. I\u2019ll stick with just my state and if I don\u2019t like my state, I can move to a different one.Before you scoff, consider some realities: there is a HUGE disparity between the amount of revenue that individual states provide to the Federal gov\u2019t versus the amount of aid they receive from the federal gov\u2019t. For example, in FY2012, Mississippi provided the second LOWEST revenue per capita at $3503 to the federal gov\u2019t, yet relied the most on federal aid, with 45.3% of their state revenue coming from aid. Whereas in that same year, Connecticut provided the third HIGHEST revenue per capita at $13163, while ranking #46 for reliance on federal aid, with only 23.6% of their state revenue coming from aid. Whatcha think is gonna happen when, say, Trump stops providing federal aid to California, and they go: OKAY LOL we\u2019ll stop paying federal taxes then and federally dependent states like Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Missouri, South Dakota, etc can go screw themselves. Combine this with the fact that the American Electoral System \u2018punishes\u2019 states that vote overwhelmingly one party or another: since Clinton won huge margins in many of her states (e.g. 61.5% of California vs. Trump\u2019s 33.2%), America ended up in the awkward situation of its president actually losing the popular vote. All of this wrapped up with the neat little fact that partisanship is at an all time high. In 1960, just 5% of Republicans and 4% of Democrats said they would be unhappy if their children married someone of the opposing party. Today it is HALF \u2013 50%!!! \u2013 of Republicans and a third of Democrats. In 2016, 45% of Republicans and 41% of Democrats said that the other side\u2019s policies were a THREAT to the nation. Not just misguided. A THREAT.So not only would I say it\u2019s *possible* that the United States will fracture (dramatically or otherwise), but I consider it *probable*, especially as environmental and population pressures continue to increase.###In summary, The Water Knife is an easy book to recommend. It\u2019s highly flawed, but it\u2019s such a smooth read \u2013 and with such a thought-provoking setting \u2013 that even despite the flaws, the reading experience is a good one."}, {"userName": "Miquel Codony", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1886234-miquel-codony", "userReview": "(4,5/5)Lo he disfrutado much\u00edsimo, bastante m\u00e1s que The Windup Girl a pesar de la mayor ambici\u00f3n de este \u00faltimo.

I loved The Windup girl, and I\u2019ve been hanging out to read the Water Knife ever since it was published. I love a good dystopia, and Bacigalupi really delivered with the post-climate change, post-petrochemical, post-everything-that-makes-life-easy Thailand of his last novel. The first half of The Water Knife is four star work- it's pacey and set in a fascinating and plausible world with interesting characters. The drought stricken states of Nevada, California and Arizona are all battling each other over water rights and willing to watch their neighbours die in the name of self preservation. Texas is gone, hurricane-d and dessicated into ruin. The remaining Texan refugees are treated like sub-humans, either killed as they attempt to reach wetter states or left to dehydrate in arid refugee camps.So far, so dystopically awesome.However, as the narrative developed there were a few things that jarred, and ultimately kicked me out of the story into those \u2018why did author do that?!\u2019 style thoughts that can be the death of reading enjoyment. Firstly, I'm pretty jaded (thanks, American Psycho!), but a couple of the book\u2019s torture/maiming sequences jarred a bit- I find such things more effective when the reader is left to fill in the blanks, rather than being shown the cattle prod/pliers/scalpel in action.Secondly, while the main character- the eponymous water knife - is pretty cool, with his Spanish slang (I now know what a pendejo is, and look forward to using the word in my next Spanish class) and his series of suped-up Teslas, The other major characters- a Phoenix journalist and a Texan refugee weren\u2019t quite as easy for me to buy, and their character arcs were a little unsatisfying.There\u2019s also one particularly nasty villain with great potential for comeuppance or closure who simply disappears when it feels like he was being setup for a return and was then left out of the final draft.Finally, the ending was a bit of a letdown- the resolution seemed to come together too quickly and easily, and I didn\u2019t really buy it.Overall though, The Water Knife is an enjoyable read, if not quite the story it could have been. Bacigalupi is a master of dystopic scenarios and his dust-storm wracked Arizona with its massive refugee camps built around Red Cross disaster relief water pumps will stay with me."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18810398-andy", "userReview": "Excited! Been such an age since the Wind-up Girl which was a superb & plausible tale of a near future, captivating throughout!However on finishing The Water Knife I have firstly to say that this is not of the same depth & wealth of world building nor character development of its prequel......What\u2019s it all about? \u2013 Water! It\u2019s the most sought after commodity, the rich shower in it whilst the poor recycle their own piss so they can drink their daily requirement. The land is desolate, the landscape dust swept, a filter is a must to protect the lungs, cities have begun to vie for the water reserves & different states have risen above others. The story is set in Phoenix & involves Nevada, Las Vegas & Callie water company\u2019s who are now the equivalent of today\u2019s big corporations (think there above the law) and who do any & everything in their power to secure the precious resource to keep their cities & states alive & prosperous. Much to like about this early doors as the short chapters pull the story forward whilst the differing story threads begin to intertwine & I do like the majority of the characters & their stories of their world, how they survive. Its all good. Where it goes wrong for me is how they interact when they all converse around the \u00be mark, instead of a thrilling ride to the final conclusion, it kinda fizzles out & is a bit of a lame finish..... almost rushed even Summing up - No-where nearly as richly detailed as the Wind-up girl & follows more the sort of storyline his shipbreaker series does except the protagonists are adults, same writing vein & more styled for a young adult audience would be my final take on it all. Good for the most part but it\u2019s not quite the Wind-up girl. 3.5 Stars rounded down to 3."}, {"userName": "Milo (BOK)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6106947-milo-bok", "userReview": "The Review Can Also Be Found Here: http://thefictionalhangout.blogspot.c....WATER IS POWER\"Paolo Bacigalupi, New York Times best-selling author of The Windup Girl and National Book Award finalist, delivers a near-future thriller that casts new light on how we live today\u2014and what may be in store for us tomorrow.The American Southwest has been decimated by drought. Nevada and Arizona skirmish over dwindling shares of the Colorado River, while California watches, deciding if it should just take the whole river all for itself. Into the fray steps Las Vegas water knife Angel Velasquez. Detective, assassin, and spy, Angel \u201ccuts\u201d water for the Southern Nevada Water Authority and its boss, Catherine Case, ensuring that her lush, luxurious arcology developments can bloom in the desert and that anyone who challenges her is left in the gutted-suburban dust.When rumors of a game-changing water source surface in Phoenix, Angel is sent to investigate. With a wallet full of identities and a tricked-out Tesla, Angel arrows south, hunting for answers that seem to evaporate as the heat index soars and the landscape becomes more and more oppressive. There, Angel encounters Lucy Monroe, a hardened journalist, who knows far more about Phoenix\u2019s water secrets than she admits, and Maria Villarosa, a young Texas migrant, who dreams of escaping north to those places where water still falls from the sky.As bodies begin to pile up and bullets start flying, the three find themselves pawns in a game far bigger, more corrupt, and dirtier than any of them could have imagined. With Phoenix teetering on the verge of collapse and time running out for Angel, Lucy, and Maria, their only hope for survival rests in one another\u2019s hands. But when water is more valuable than gold, alliances shift like sand, and the only truth in the desert is that someone will have to bleed if anyone hopes to drink.Ever since I first heard about The Windup Girl, Paulo Bacigalupi has been on my to read list so when I saw a copy of The Water Knife on NetGalley I knew I couldn\u2019t resist requesting it and it did not disappoint when I got the chance to read it, with Bacigalupi creating an awesome standalone novel taking place in a dystopian world unlike any other, offering a different take on the future that is handled very well indeed, exploring the water drought and its consequences that led the American southwest decimated. Now a fight over water is beginning, with Arizona and Nevada skirmishing over the lapsing Colorado River, with California watching, deciding whether or not it should just take the whole river for itself. And a Las Vegas Water Knife, Angel Velasquez, a detective, spy and assassin, steps into the fray to ensure that his boss Catherin Case continues her monopoly on any water developments in the desert, and when rumours of something in Phoenix crop up, Angel is sent out to investigate and finds himself crossing paths with a hardened journalist Lucy Monroe and Texas Migrant Maria Villarosa.It\u2019s an interesting blend of characters and a unique take on a dystopian future with most novels preferring to head so far into the future so that planet Earth is almost unrecognisable. The names of states are often gone, and any mention of the present day is brushed aside in favour of usually a ruthless dictator and some teenagers trying to overthrow his regime. If you\u2019re tired of the normal dystopian tropes then you\u2019ll want to turn your attention to The Water Knife, which is a brilliant, fascinating read that\u2019s rich, well developed and well written. It\u2019s one of my favourite dystopian that I\u2019ve read in recent years, matching the likes of Emily St. John Mandel\u2019s excellent Station Eleven in terms of quality.The Water Knife focuses on three different main characters all mentioned in the blurb above who all share POVs. They\u2019re each flawed, well rounded and well developed characters who have fascinating storylines and it\u2019s great to see them interact with one another as interaction is something that Bacigalupi nails. Angel Velasquez, Lucy Monroe and Maria Villarosa are all great characters, and really make for fantastic narrators and it\u2019s great to follow the path that they travel, with nobody ever really being safe and the tension always being kept high. It\u2019s a pretty violent book that\u2019s not for the faint of heart, packing enough originality to stand out from pretty much everything else on the market right now.It dares to tackle current themes, with Water droughts in California being prevalent in America right now making this book almost feel as though it actually could be a vision of the future, offering a fresh approach to something that we haven\u2019t seen before. There\u2019s enough attention to the world given in The Water Knife as a fantastic backdrop and we find ourselves fully immersed in the setting. However, the human story at the heart of the book is the most prominent, and really drives the narrative forward.The Water Knife isn\u2019t exactly the lightest novel around, dealing with some heavy content, but the many areas that Bacigalupi handles are executed well. I didn\u2019t really have any major problems whilst reading this and I think this is something that should certainly appeal to fans of Station Eleven, as I\u2019ve mentioned above, as well as fans of Bacigalupi\u2019s previous novels and anyone looking for something different in the dystopian genre. Regardless, it\u2019s certainly something that comes highly recommended, whichever reason you\u2019re buying the book for.VERDICT: 9.5/10"}], "description": "In the American Southwest, Nevada, Arizona, and California skirmish for dwindling shares of the Colorado River.
