First, Hazel Marie, the former mistress of Julia\u2019s first husband and the mother of Wesley Lloyd Springer\u2019s illegitimate son, Lloyd, gets really sick. Taking Hazel Marie to the doctor, Miss Julia has to put her friend in the hospital until the young doctor substituting for the regular doctor on vacation finally does a pregnancy test, which comes out positive. But Hazel Marie has just broken up with her longtime gentleman friend, JD Pickens, because he has no desire to get married, so Hazel Marie has decided to stand up for herself and end things with Mr. Pickens and refuses to tell him about her pregnancy. So ashamed of having another illegitimate baby, Hazel Marie tries to find all sorts of schemes to get away from town, so no one will know her sin. And Miss Julia is determined to do everything to keep Hazel Marie and Lloyd in town.Read the rest of this review and other fun, geeky articles at Fangirl Nation"}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5779782-ellen", "userReview": "Miss Julia Delivers the Goods. by Ann B.

I checked this one out on a whim as an e-audio book from the library, and it was a rollicking good time. The reader of the book was outstanding in portraying her personality. I get a little perturbed at how constantly she worries about what all the townsfolk will say and goes all around the houses trying to keep gossip at bay, only having to face it in the end anyway. You'd think she'd learn by now, but if she did that, there wouldn't be a story, now, would there?

Hazel Marie is tired of being always the girlfriend, never the wife, and has sent J.D. packing. But then she goes down with a mysterious illness that makes her throw up, especially in the mornings. Meanwhile, Sam's house has been burgled, and it seems to be related to his researches into the history of Abbotsville. I enjoyed this one.

Miss Julia has her quirks and sometimes they drive me crazy, but the overall story always wins out with me.I listened to BOCD. The narrator bothered me and it took me several CDs to stop obsessing about her vocal changes. I felt her portrayal of Lillian, Miss Julia's African-American cook/housekeeper/sidekick, was more like \"Steppin' Fetchit\" from movies in the first half of the 20th century...borderline racial stereotype...not in the writing, but in the vocal portrayal. Ms. Darlow (the narrator) sounded at times like Susan Sarandon's character in \"Bull Durham\" crossed with Southern school marm...just not to my liking. Once I lightened up on hearing the voice I enjoyed it better."}, {"userName": "Dawn King", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12339777-dawn-king", "userReview": "The adventures of Miss Julia is captured by Ann B. Ross in this popular series. While this is not high literature, I thoroughly enjoy the situations that Miss Julia finds herself in. She is like a madcap Angela Lansbury careening through her small southern town trying to please everyone while dealing with her many personal crazy friends and relations. These are hilarious and often you can't put them down. I don't know why they never made this into a comedy series.I would recommend that you read the first part of the series before reading the other books.

I think this is it. As I was reading, I realized I did read one of her earlier books. This was pretty easy reading and I figured out that it is mostly about an older lady who is a huge busy body in her small town and that is basically what the book was about. The mystery in the book was a smaller second part of the story and not real interesting.

Ross\u2019s Miss Julia Delivers the Goods, I have now read ten of the books in the series. This one is my least favorite. Most of the narrative is Miss Julia, the indomitable Southern matriarch of a very unusual \u201cfamily,\u201d fretting over a problem in Hazel Marie\u2019s life. Hazel Marie was Miss Julia\u2019s late husband\u2019s mistress, so you can see what I mean when I put quotation marks around the word family. Hazel Marie\u2019s problem could lead to her leaving their small North Carolina town, and if that happens, Miss Julia will lose not only this younger woman she\u2019s come to love but also Hazel Marie\u2019s son Lloyd, the offspring of Miss Julia\u2019s deceased husband and a young man whom Miss Julia thinks the world of. The mystery that usually appears in this book that involves Miss Julia, often puts her life in danger, and provides a dilemma for her to solve is present in Miss Julia Delivers the Goods, but it is extremely secondary to Hazel Marie\u2019s problem. And therein lies my issue with this edition of the series. I found it tedious, for we know in the end that all will be resolved harmoniously and the solving here just seems to be a \u201clet\u2019s get it done; no, we\u2019re delayed\u201d over and over and over. The narrative moves quickly, the characters are charming and engaging as ever, albeit frustrating in their actions, and I will definitely read the next book in the series. But I have to say, for me, this one just didn\u2019t please as much as the others of Ross\u2019s Miss Julia books."}, {"userName": "Heidi Burkhart", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16095582-heidi-burkhart", "userReview": "I feel very entertained when I listen to Ann B.

I vaccillated between thinking that Miss Julia was adorable, and thinking she was insufferable. This older Southern woman definitely has a distinctive voice. It is clear that she has a kind heart, although it is sometimes buried beneath a layer of entitlement and rigid judgment. She has strong opinions on everything, and voices them loudly, whether it concerns her or not. It is also clear that this is all supposed to be funny. The see-saw of my opinion could have tipped either way. Eventually, since I hate to give up reading a book midway through (out of stubbornness, not out of virtue), I decided to go with the \"amusing\" evaluation, and allow myself to enjoy the misunderstandings, and goofball situations, and unnecessary drama. Most of the drama centers around the fact that Hazel Marie is pregnant out of wedlock, and has broken up with her boyfriend (who doesn't know about the baby), and refuses to see him again. Miss Julia intends to get him back in town, and get the two married. There is also a mystery surrounding a theft and breakup.One of my strongest reactions to this story is to be glad that, for the most part, as a society, at least in New York, we have grown far beyond caring whether a woman has a husband or not. I agree that having a man and wife raising their children together, in most cases makes a secure home for the child, but to worry about bringing shame on the family, or to worry about being drummed out of the ladies' clubs for immorality, that is archaic, and good riddance to it.While managing to enjoy what there is to enjoy in this Miss Julia book, and while able to recommend this to people who want to read for pleasure without being disturbed by too much gore or heavy, depressing stuff, I probably will not go on to read the rest of the Miss Julia series."}], "description": "Get ready for double the trouble and twice the fun in Ann B.
