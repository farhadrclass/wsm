Think Wallbanger meets Beautiful Bastard :)You smiling yet? I was hooked from the first line and smiling wide by the end of the first page. If you are a fan of enemies-to-lovers stories, you will LOVE Tangled!I swear half my book is highlighted. I laughed out loud, grinned till my cheeks ached and just generally loved it!The story is about Drew. In real life, Drew is a clean-shaven, well-groomed, expensive suit wearing professional. But, at the start of the story, he\u2019s a miserable un-showered, un-shaven heap locked in a messy apartment overflowing with old pizza boxes while claiming to have the flu.Right.What he really has is a bad case of the Break Up.See Real Life Drew was once a player. Why settle for one when there were so many willing ones tripping over themselves to be with him?\u201cI\u2019ve never seduced a woman before.Shocking, I know.Let me clarify. I\u2019ve never had to seduce a woman before, not in the typical sense. Usually it just takes a look, a wink, a smile. A friendly greeting, maybe a drink or two. After that, the only verbal exchange involves short, one-word phrases like harder, more, lower\u2026 You get the point.\u201d  But he\u2019s fallen in love. Finally. Problem is, she\u2019s getting married\u2026 to someone else. Hence the miserable, moping, un-shaved heap. This is his story.It starts off going back in time to when they first met. Drew meets Kate at a club one night and, despite the flirting, she walks away. When Kate gets hired by his office, it puts him in a frustrating situation because office romances are on his no-no list.  \u201cKate Brooks is officially scratched off my list of potentials. She is forbidden, untouchable, a no-way-never. Right next to my friends\u2019 ex-girlfriends, the boss\u2019 daughter, and my sister\u2019s best friends.Well, that last category is a bit of a gray area.\u201d  We are told the story by Drew. He can be a bit of an asshat but you really just can\u2019t help falling for him \u2013 he\u2019s that lovable. He both narrates the events and breaks the 4th wall by talking directly to us as the reader. It\u2019s totally awesome! It\u2019s like he\u2019s right there telling you the story. There are times when his commentary on what was going on just had me in stitches. Here\u2019s a random quote:  \u201cOnce again, to the ladies out there \u2014 here\u2019s a fact for you: Men pretty much have sex on the brain twenty-four-seven. The exact figure is like every 5.2 seconds or some shit like that.The point is, when you ask, \u201cWhat do you want for dinner?\u201d we\u2019re thinking about screwing you on the kitchen counter. When you\u2019re telling us about the sappy film you watched with your girlfriends last week, we\u2019re thinking about the porno we saw on cable last night. When you show us the designer shoes you bought on sale, we\u2019re thinking how nice they would look on our shoulders.I just thought you\u2019d want to know. Don\u2019t shoot the messenger.\u201d  And if you like strong heroines, you will LOVE Kate. She is smart, confident, sassy and absolutely determined not to become another notch on Drew\u2019s bed post. She has plans, dreams, goals and no time for a playboy.  \u201cIf we\u2019re going to work together, Drew, I think we\u2019re should get a few things straight. I\u2019m not your sweetheart. My name is Kate \u2014 Katherine. Use it. And I\u2019m not a kiss-ass. I don\u2019t have to be. My work speaks for itself.\u201d  Their banter and \u2018sparring\u2019 was just priceless! Tangled was essentially an enemies-to-lovers story about guy falling in love for the first time with a girl who goes toe-to-toe with him on everything. I loved watching them work through their issues. And when Drew finally decides to fight for Kate\u2019s heart, the lengths to which he goes are just laugh-out-loud awesome!  \u201cIt makes me want to kiss her and strangle her at the same time. I\u2019ve never been into S&M, but I\u2019m beginning to see its benefits.\u201d  The book wasn\u2019t always funny per say, but the whole mood was light hearted. The sex was hot, the characters were lovable, the writing was witty and it has a happy ending :)If you are looking for a FUN read, this is it!!!!4.5 stars Thank you to the publisher for providing me an ARC to review. ******************************BLURB -->  Drew Evans is a winner. Handsome and arrogant, he makes multimillion dollar business deals and seduces New York\u2019s most beautiful women with just a smile. He has loyal friends and an indulgent family. So why has he been shuttered in his apartment for seven days, miserable and depressed? He\u2019ll tell you he has the flu.But we all know that\u2019s not really true.Katherine Brooks is brilliant, beautiful and ambitious. She refuses to let anything - or anyone - derail her path to success. When Kate is hired as the new associate at Drew\u2019s father\u2019s investment banking firm, every aspect of the dashing playboy\u2019s life is thrown into a tailspin. The professional competition she brings is unnerving, his attraction to her is distracting, his failure to entice her into his bed is exasperating. Then, just when Drew is on the cusp of having everything he wants, his overblown confidence threatens to ruin it all. Will he be able untangle his feelings of lust and tenderness, frustration and fulfillment? Will he rise to the most important challenge of his life? Can Drew Evans win at love? Tangled is not your mother\u2019s romance novel. It is an outrageous, passionate, witty narrative about a man who knows a lot about women\u2026just not as much as he thinks he knows. As he tells his story, Drew learns the one thing he never wanted in life, is the only thing he can\u2019t live without.

This book had me hooked from the very first page and I couldn\u2019t get enough! Being inside Drew Evan\u2019s head was amazing! One of the funniest and most enjoyable stories I have read in a really long time! \nMeet Drew Evans. He is a successful business man, a handsome guy, he\u2019s got great friends, a loving family, and as many women as he could ever want. Drew is hot and Drew knows it. Drew doesn\u2019t do relationships. He never makes promises, he just does his thing. \nThroughout this story, Drew gives us a ton of fun facts and info:\u2028\nMen are visual. We wouldn\u2019t be fucking you if we didn\u2019t want to look at you. You can write that down.I control my dick. My dick does not control me.I sleep naked, by the way. You should try it. If you haven\u2019t slept naked, you haven\u2019t lived. But thats beside the point.For those ladies out there who are listening, let me give you some free advice: If a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel or any other generic endearment? Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking he\u2019s so into you, he\u2019s already thinking up pet names. It\u2019s because he can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t care to remember your actual name.Deep down- I\u2019m a momma\u2019s boy. I\u2019m man enough to admit it. And trust me, I\u2019m not the only one. Explains a lot, doesn\u2019t it?Here\u2019s a fact for you \u2013 once I\u2019m done, I\u2019m done. I\u2019m not the kind of guy who rides the same rollercoaster twice \nYou get the idea of what kind of guy he is, yeah? Well, Drew hasn\u2019t been himself. He has \u2018the flu\u2019. The last week he hasn\u2019t been well. And it all has to do with one woman. Katherine Brooks.\nKate works with Drew. She is new at the firm and she is ready to succeed. She is smart, beautiful, feisty and she intrigues Drew in every way. There is something different about Kate. While competing against each other for the same account, these two bicker and banter back and forth... its hilarious! There is also some major sexual tension going on, but there are complications. They get to know each other better and Drew decides he wants Kate. Drew screws up a ton, but he is a guy, what do you expect? He goes through some great lengths to make it better. \nSome of the BEST lines:\nIt makes me want to kiss her and strangle her at the same time. I\u2019ve never been into S&M. But I\u2019m beginning to see its benefits.Edward Cullen can take his stupid heroine and OD on it. Kate is my own personal brand of Viagra.Twelve days. Its a frigging record. I haven\u2019t had a drought like this since the winter of ninety-nine. \u201cGod! Oh God!\u201d\u2028\u201cGod\u2019s not the one fucking you, baby.\u201d\u201cDrew... Drew... yes... Drew!\u201dMuch better.\u201cYou have no sense of self-preservation, do you?\u201d\u2028\u201cNo, not at the moment. I\u2019m too focused on... fornication.\u201dI blame Adam. Now theres a guy who had the world by the balls. Walking around naked, a hot chick to satisfy his every whim. I sure hope that apple was tasty, \u2018cause he really fucked it up for the rest of us.\nThis is how I looked a majority of the book:\nI can\u2019t tell you how impressed I was with this debut novel! I don\u2019t think I have ever read a book that has made me smile and laugh so much. I love the male pov and it was a treat to have the whole story written in the male\u2019s pov! The whole time I was reading, I felt like Drew was talking to me. Drew is the best kind of character. He is funny, sarcastic, sexy and sweet! I couldn\u2019t get enough of him! And I liked Kate too lol! The whole thing- It was great! Can I say there was nothing I didn\u2019t like about this one! Loved everything it! Going on the favorites shelf for sure.

Original review: 2014LOVED THIS! LOVED IT!I laughed, and laughed, and laughed, and then I laughed some more. Sooooo good!I have to say that I understand why some people found this book (Drew's voice in particular) offensive, rude, and obnoxious. He's a self-centered man-whore, and his inner thoughts are not even slightly redeeming. We first meet him while he's getting a BJ from a random redhead in a bathroom, and his immediate thoughts are only how quickly he can extract himself from her and move on to the next good time. Because why in the world would he have sex with the same woman twice?Hang on. Did she just say she had a twin? Aaaaand we're back in business! Is Drew honest, or is he just a horrible person? Maybe a little bit of both.Thing is, I married a guy who sounds like Drew. Many years later, I'm used to that particular brand of honesty, so it cracked me up on several different levels. However, if you don't like leading men who aren't PC, then you'll want to steer clear of this one because this guy is guaranteed to offend you.I get it, I do. It's just that my husband has used the excuse \n\"because I'm not a giant vagina\"\n to get out of doing so many things with me that I'm desensitized to it.At any rate, I loved Drew and Kate's story, and I can see myself coming back and revisiting this book over and over again.This a typical romance in that Drew is unbelievably sexy, unbelievably rich, and unbelievably skilled with women.I should be annoyed with his lack of Real-World issues, but this was funny enough that I managed to overlook his...lack of flaws, I guess? Tangled is one of those stories that I just chalked up to complete fantasy, and decided not to let my sensible side squish the fun.Mild Spoilers Ahead: Here's what I thought the author did right:First, when Drew realizes he's in love, he doesn't run off and deny it. It doesn't make sense when they have characters do that, you know? If you're in love, you act the fool. You do the whole embarrassing PDA stuff, you talk about them until your friends want to strangle you, and you otherwise just act all goofy and stupid.You don't run off. Not even relationship-shy dudes.I think that's something certain people tell themselves when their love interest runs for the hills.Oh, they're just scared of their feelings!Ehhh. I think they just don't like you.Maybe I'm wrong. I'm not.Second, it takes Kate a reasonable amount of convincing to take Drew back at the end.I know that some of you are probably thinking she took him back too soon, but let's face it, she was crazy about him. If you already want to believe someone, then it doesn't usually take much for them to convince you of something. She hung in there longer than I would have...I'm not sure how I missed out on this little gem, but I'm sure glad I found it.If you haven't read this one yet, you need to check it out!\nPS - You can thank Jeff & Trish for all of the extra Hemsworth gifs I had laying around..."}, {"userName": "Heather K (dentist in my spare time)", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time", "userReview": "*1.5 stars*Okay, I know that everyone loves this book. But, honestly, I despised it.This book sort of reminded me of a Kristen Ashley book. There was this stereotype of what a \"guy\" is, and how a \"guy\" thinks. But...I've known a guy or two in my day. This book reads like what a GIRL thinks a guy is like. Tangled had so many loathsome tropes. We get a magical vagina turning a pigheaded guy into a devoted man. We get the adorable niece (which can be replaced by doting younger sister in some books), who shows a dickhead's \"loving\" side. We get blatant misogyny and even SEXUAL HARRASMENT at work framed as \"just teasing\" and \"all in good fun,\" offset by, of course, an even bigger asshole who \"crosses the line\" and shows that the MC isn't all that bad. The male MC doesn't respect the female MC. He doesn't respect her boundaries, he doesn't respect her intelligence, and he doesn't show that he is worthy of her for a hot second. I didn't think this book was funny. I didn't think this book was entertaining. I didn't think the male MC read like a man or how a man thinks. The only reason this book gets an extra 1/2 a star is because the narrator did a nice job reading the story, but if I didn't spend good money on the ebook + the audiobook upgrade, I would have DNFed it (like I wanted to do!) ages ago.

But I\u2019m beginning to see its benefits.\u201d\n\nDrew Evans is every girl's dream; successful, devilishly handsome and charming, he'll make you combust with one look and rip off your clothes (and his) with one touch. There's only one problem. The woman he can't get out of his head is rejecting him, and now they work in the same firm and they have to compete each other for a huge project. They fight, they share angry kisses and then they fight some more, until things happen and Drew gets the flu and he realizes that maybe his perfect life is not so perfect without Kate Brooks after all.\n\n\u201cBecause I had a life once. A life I loved. It was consistent. Fun. It was reliable. Safe. And then one night, a beautiful dark-haired girl came along and blew it all to kingdom come.\u201d\n\nThat's pretty accurate. Drew was delicious, his scenes with Kate were delicious, \neverything was delicious\n! There's no female author that can write a male POV better than Emma Chase, she's the I-know-what-men-think guru! Is this a psychic thing? An otherworld ability? A pact with the devil? I don't know, but it's awesome! Given the situation between Drew and Kate and the reasons they could not be together at first, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the story the same if it was narrated by Kate!\n\n\u201cNewsflash, ladies: We can\u2019t read your thoughts. And frankly, I\u2019m not entirely sure I\u2019d want to. The female mind is a scary place to be.\u201d \n\nDrew could be a total jackass at some points, but he was a funny and occasionally sweet jackass. The way he talked to the readers, gave advice and commented on his story was extremely entertaining, it felt like there was a movie playing inside my head! And holy bananas! he was \nhot\n. I was so dehydrated due to his hotness that I couldn't even drool. I still can't.When you're in the mood for a book to cheer you up, read Emma Chase.

I laughed, I was entertained, I swooned. Tangled, book with witty and sarcastic hero as narrator, is a MUST READ! This insight into man's head and thinking is fascinating and a lot of fun.My Drew and Kate:SPOILER-FREE REVIEW:Drew Evans used to be always on the top of things, getting everything he wanted and enjoying life of a single good-looking bachelor. Until he got flu which changed him into whinning man, lying down on his couch and watching stupid movies for a whole week. Or was in not the flu that brought this strong man into this pathetic state?After short prologue, story is set four months earlier to the times when Drew is successful gentleman who is enjoying services of various willing ladies every time opportunity arises. Yep, he is a man-whore. Also, Drew is extra confident person so when he meets woman he wants and cannot get, he is not willing to accept it. But what happens when proffesional competion and love gets into his way and complicates things? You get this superb and original romance story. I loved \"the voice\" and style of writing in this book. It was magical, sarcastic, witty and funny. Perfection if you like to read something entertaining with well-thought storyline developement and sexy hero. I just completely adored Drew's inner thoughts and they were pretty hilarious too. I have never read about cockier hero than Drew Evans. But you will fall for him anyway, he is just that awesome. I personally will never forget him.Kate was also awesome character. She was able to keep up with Drew all the time, matched his determination, even outsmarted him quite often. She was smart, gorgeous and ambitious. Dangerous combination when it comes to woman, right?And story itself? It was flawless. There were moments that made me laugh, moments that left me all hot and bothered, as well as angsty or lovely moments. To be honest, I could not find single thing that I would not like about this book. I hope this author will write more books in future. I will be reading it as soon as they come out.

Don\u2019t call me, \u2019cause I sure as shit won\u2019t be calling you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNewsflash, ladies: We can\u2019t read your thoughts. And frankly, I\u2019m not entirely sure I\u2019d want to. The female mind is a scary place to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter meeting and getting to know Drew it was a pleasure to meet Katherine Brooks, Kate the woman who brought him to his knees or should I say sick-bed. From ordinary rather humble beginnings her intelligence, determination and ambition earned her a scholarship and a MBA at Wharton school of business. Upon her graduation she is hired by the prestigious Evans, Reinhart and Fisher. Her new job will prove challenging on so many levels much thanks to Drew. Not helping matters; she has also brought with her, to the big city, her high-school sweetheart and fianc\u00e9. Five words to describe Kate: Smart, beautiful, assertive, classy and loyal.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Drew, by the way.\u201d I hold out my hand. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d She holds up her hand. \u201cEngaged.\u201d \n\n\nAnd so their roller-coaster story begins; For Drew mostly a descent as his life spins out of control:\n\n\n\u201cAlthough my mind recognizes that Kate Brooks is now my rival, apparently my c~ck hasn\u2019t gotten the memo.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n \u201cI told you how I grew up. I never had to share my toys; I don\u2019t plan on sharing my clients. Ask any four-year-old\u2014sharing sucks.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone cold turkey. Completely. I haven\u2019t even jerked off. Not once. In nine frigging days. I think the buildup of semen is starting to affect my brain. Like sugar to a diabetic.\u201d\n\n\n***Hero rating: 5+ stars Heroine rating: 5 starsSex scenes rating: 5 starsSex scenes frequency: 4.5 starsStoryline concept rating: 5+ starsStorytelling skills rating: 5 starsStory ending rating: 5 starsBook editing rating (5 = no edits spotted): 5 stars************************************************Overall rating: 5+ starsWould I recommend this series: Yes.Would I re-read this series: Yes!!!Would I read future books by this author: Yes."}, {"userName": "Pearl Angeli", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31514572-pearl-angeli", "userReview": "5 Hilarious Stars!\nNEW BOOK BOYFRIEND ALERT\n: Drew frigging EvansWhy it took me so long to read this book is beyond me. If there's a guilty-pleasure New Adult book that is worth your attention, it's Tangled by Emma Chase. It's funny as hell and so addictive. Emma's writing was also so delicious you just can't get enough of it!The story centers around Drew Evans. It's told in his POV. Yes, guys. His and his POV alone. I don't normally encounter a romance book where the only one that speaks is the guy. It's fun and refreshing in a way. It's nice to know Drew's thoughts-- including the dirty and naughty ones. lol. So one night, Drew met this alluring brunette named Katherine 'Kate' Brooks in a club and yes, there was insta-lust in Drew's side (in a not-annoying way, mind you). Since then, he was not able to take Kate off his mind. And surprise! He learned one day that Kate's going to be his new co-worker in the company he's working which is owned by his dad. Now I won't get that far into describing the plot. Let Drew do the talking. Listen to him and prepare yourself for a bunch of laugh-out-loud moments because you'll surely get them here... all the freaking time!Picture me while I was reading thisYou might think that this book only features tons of craziness and sexual nothings. Not. I learned a lot of things from Drew. His relationship tips are so sensible, I tell you guys. You want relationship facts and tips from the playboy's perspective? Drop your Cosmopolitan and listen to Drew.As a sample, \n\n\"Assume nothing. Even if you think you know everything. Even if you're sure that you're right. Get confirmation. That whole \"ass\" clich\u00e9 about assuming? It's right on the money. And if you're not careful, it could end costing you the best thing that's ever happen to you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Women fall in love quicker than men. Easier and more often. But when guys fall? We go down harder. And when things go bad? When it's not us who ends it? We don't get to walk away. We crawl.\"\n\n... and so much more.What also entertained me most was Drew's set of analogies and comparisons that he added in almost everything that he narrated in this book, like:\n\n\"She's like a Rubik's Cube. So frustrating at times that you want to toss it out the goddamn window. But you don't. You can't. You're compelled to keep playing with it until you figure it out.\"\n\nThere were no dull moments in this book. What it offered was pure entertainment. My favorite scene and the one that definitely had me cracking up was the dinner scene where Drew's little niece Mackenzie talked and spoke a vulgar word that had everyone immediately react in such a funny way. (Drew's dad choking, Matthew spitting up the juice right on Steven's face, etc.) LMAO. I laughed for about three minutes with that! Also, I didn't only admire Drew and Kate's characters but I also adored the secondary ones, especially Delores a.k.a. Deedee. She's one badass woman and I can't wait to read her story and Matthew's.This book also built up a remarkable sexual tension which led to sexual frustration and then some. Basically, the relationship and character development was amazing here. Tangled, as a whole, was a very entertaining rom-com book. It came packed with sizzling hot chemistry between the characters and it's simply designed to make you feel good and happy. I totally enjoyed Drew's POV here. The best! The ending was also wholly satisfying and it left me with a big smile on my face. This was my first Emma Chase book and it certainly won't be the last."}, {"userName": "Lisa Jayne", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11963959-lisa-jayne", "userReview": "5 TANGLED DREW & KATE STARSI just hopped off the Drew Evans express and Well what can I say? first things bloody first, WHAT.A.RIDE. I didn't want to get off ... I unabashedly fell for Drew and Kate. With that being said, Stop everything, drop everything and forget the following: food, housework, husbands, boyfriends, significant other, pets, social life, sleeping, etc. and READ.THIS.BOOK get your comfy spot, your kindle and dive right in.I've got a total soft spot for a well put together book from the Male point of view. Judging from the front cover of this novel who wouldn't want to get into this males head. This story is completely Refreshing, Outrageously Funny and utterly Lovely, lovely, lovely and yes I enjoyed the verbal foreplay just as much, if not more than these fictional characters.The author sums up this book by her very own words right around 59% mark:\"The dashing playboy meets the take-no-prisoners girl of his dreams, and she snags his heart forever.\"You know the drill ~ he's a man whore, she's the sweetest thing to have graced a books pages. They flirt, they fall out, they can't imagine life without each other blah blah blah ...No STOP, Its more than that, MUCH MORE. I mean it is all of the above, but written so fabulously that you will be hooked. It is Full of heart, comedy gold standard funny and at the same time Devilishly naughty.She's his curveball 'The one'. He's the epitome of 'allergic to commitment twenty something' add to the mix that they come together in a showdown of all office wars and you get ~'Tangled'.This brilliant author has written a book with an air of confidence and originality and I'm pretty convinced I'll stalk this author for future releases. With all of that being said Starting this book I originally felt as though I missed a female voice - yes I'm well aware that the male point of view was a selling point for the story and believe me I was sold too, so after a while I told myself to get over it and enjoy the Drew ride and i did! call me crazy (I'm well aware of that fact) But I have a book butterfly radar, you know the effect of a book stealing your book sanity, the swoons, heart thumping that 'feeling'? well that was missing for me in some ways, but the brilliance of this laugh out loud, fabulously witty book more than compensated and as I got to the end of the book I sat back with a huge smile on my face thinking I understand the hype ~ I.TOTALLY.GET.IT.Standing ovation for this authors debut novel, here's a few of my favourite quotes (the whole book could be highlighted).\u2764\u2764\u201cEdward Cullen can take his stupid heroine and OD on it. Kate is my own personal brand of Viagra.\u201d \u2764\u2764\u201cNewsflash, ladies: We can\u2019t read your thoughts. And frankly, I\u2019m not entirely sure I\u2019d want to.

The so-called \"comedy\" was SO forced the entire book. Now you will tell me that it was SUPPOSE to be sarcastic and funny, and that fact that it is from Guy POV play huge part in this. I'll tell you darling this is bullshit!First of all, if you know me you'll know that i LOVE books with boy POV , meaning i read a lot of those, this one was THE WORST!!!And that is NOT a comedy! if you think so, then your sense of humor is dead .I'm sorry for your lost!Some Authors can write HILARIOUS books and you feel that they come naturally. A high school student can write this before even taking writing 101. Sad... Don't get me wrong the idea behind this book is funny and brilliant, but the most important thing here is how to turn this idea to an actual book!

I would read something and say hahah this is Fuu, funn,no this is not funny!\nMaybe it's me, maybe i don't have a sense of humor? NAAAH i have an excellent taste and this book is rubbish.Don't get me wrong, there are things that i liked, or i wouldn't give this two whole stars, for instance:The relationship between Drew Evans and his niece. ADORABLE Mackenzie  -the niece is adorable little girl , and i loved each scene she was in. And that what kept me going through the book. There was some \"wisdom\" that Drew gave as a guy to women which i found helpful. To women out there which disparately -in my opinion they need to know about men and how they think:\n\n\"If a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel,or any other generic endearment?

Did I also happen to mention that he's a grade-A asshole? No? Well that's ok, because he's an honest one. He just calls it like he sees it.\nFor those ladies out there who are listening, let me give you some free advice: If a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel, or any other generic endearment? Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking he\u2019s so into you, he\u2019s already thinking up pet names. It\u2019s because he can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t care to remember your actual name.\nI mean, you can't fault a guy for his honesty, right? He does pretty much lay it all for you.\nDon\u2019t look at me like that. I\u2019m not a bad guy. I don\u2019t lie; I don\u2019t sandbag women with flowery words about a future together and love at first sight. I\u2019m a straight shooter. I\u2019m looking for a good time\u2014for one night\u2014and I tell them so. That\u2019s better than ninety percent of the other guys in here, believe me. And most of the girls in here are looking for the same thing I am. Okay, maybe that\u2019s not exactly true. But I can\u2019t help it if they see me, fuck me, and suddenly want to bear my children. That\u2019s not my problem.\nWell of course they do, Drew, you are a good looking, successful, and rich investment banker after all. Even old women have a thing for you\nOld women have a thing for me. And I don\u2019t mean a pinch-my-cheek, pat-me-on-the-head kind of thing. I mean a grab-my-ass, rub-my-junk, why-don\u2019t-you-push-my-wheelchair-into-the-broom-closet-so-we-can-get-nasty kind of thing. It\u2019s fucking disturbing.\nAll women typically fall over themselves to sleep with you....right? That is until one brown haired, brown eyed beauty turns you down at a club.Much to Drew's dismay, the gorgeous brunette that turns him down is actually Katherine Brooks, a new associate at his father's firm where Drew works. When they are forced to work together to attain a new client for the firm, a competition wrapped up in sexual tension arises between the two. Who cares if Katherine has a fiance?! Drew knows what he wantsWithout giving too much away, let me try to sum up what happens with a few choice quotes...\nNo, I haven\u2019t fucked her. Not that I wouldn\u2019t love to.

Easier and more often. But when guys fall? We go down harder. And when things go bad? When it's not us who ends it? We don't get to walk away.We crawl.\u201d\nOkay, so I think I was the very last person of my friends to read this book...maybe the last in the world. I thought that I wasn't in the mood for funny. Boy was I wrong.I love an author who writes a story that I end up loving before I realize that I'm already halfway through the book. So if you're not in the mood for funny, don't worry. Drew will suck you in like you wouldn't believe. There's NOTHING so great in a romance book for me than watching a proud man fall to his knees over a woman. Especially when the woman doesn't even try. This book encompasses so much of what I normally like, without caving to the tropes. Kate never tries to lure Drew in. She's just herself. No angst, no drama, NO GIGGLING, no coy glances and ridiculous flirtation. In fact, she actively tries to dissuade drew from page one. She's a confident career woman without being a bitch. But she also titillates the man whore Drew with no effort at all.Poor Drew. It really is like he's hit over the head with a cinder block when he meets Kate...and he just doesn't understand what is happening. The two are sort of frenemies before they realize it, and their banter back and forth and then their actual recon missions to sabotage each other at work is nothing short of hilarious!!! I loved it, I loved it!And then there is the inevitable boinking...which, let me just say...was off the charts hot, and totally unexpected for me. \n\u201cGod, she\u2019s beautiful. I mean, look at her. She\u2019s like a volcano going off\u2014fierce and fiery and breathtaking. If she doesn\u2019t find a way to ugly herself down, I\u2019m going to be spending an awful lot of time pissing her off. Which might not be such a bad thing in the end. Angry sex is awesome.\u201d \nOh, and then....\nTHE FALLOUT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple guy logic: If a woman is angry? It means she cares. If you\u2019re in a relationship and a chick can\u2019t even be bothered to yell at you? You\u2019re screwed. Indifference is a woman\u2019s kiss of death. It\u2019s the equivalent of a man not interested in sex. In either case\u2014it\u2019s over. You\u2019re done.\u201d \nIt's a doozy. Poor Drew. The stupid idiot. The stupid, stupid MAN!!!! And poor Kate. She tries so hard not to fall for the playboy. What IS it about playboys that gets us EVERY FREAKIN' TIME?!?! We all want to be the one who tames them. And Kate does it inadvertently. It's great to watch, because although this is touted as being hilarious and insightful, it's also very much a romance. Drew and Kate are both heartbroken. They love each other so much, and it's hard to watch them hurt each other because they are truly meant to be. Of course, the ending is a forgone conclusion, but it's still magic every time. Is that a sign of my simple mind? I don't really care. I loved this story! I loved Drew's point of view, his issues, his meldown, his love for his niece, his FLU! Gah! Just as everyone else, I fell for the playboy. Too bad he's Kate's."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237469-miriam", "userReview": "Oh, I see why romance novels are so rarely written from the point of view of the male love interest: because men are revolting, objectifying, self-centered, manipulative, potty-mouthed assholes. Chase isn't a bad writer -- she's lively, anyway, and her narrator's voice is fairly consistent, except when she tries to insert the occasional sensitive or politically correct sentiment -- but I sincerely hope men aren't all as awful as she imagines them. If it were possible I'd add half a star for having that rare beast, a woman who is actually good at her job (as opposed to the reader being informed that the woman is good at her job while she manifestly demonstrates otherwise). And moreover, good at a job that is competitive and ambitious and puts her into conflict with men. The lawsuit-worthy sexual harassment she puts up with at work is probably realistic, if the opposite of romantic. Nothing in this book was romantic to me. The \"hero\" was a manipulative, spoiled slut, and even when he decided he was in love with his coworker he never displayed any thought for her feelings, desires, or goals. Pressuring her constantly when she's just lost her fiance of ten years? Stalking and harassing her? Humiliating her in the workplace (which he gets away with because he's the boss's son) and preventing her from working effectively? Blackmailing her for a date? None of those were within the realm of acceptable human behavior to me, much less romantic. Oh, but he loves his four-year-old niece* -- awwww. He must be a sweetheart really.The most interesting thing about this book was its attempted intersection of male and female fantasies, although since the male perspective is mediated through the author's imagination of what men think like I'm not sure how useful that is. I preferred the two-author approach in Don't Look Down, where the man and woman were written by different authors. *But not enough to refrain from having inappropriate and foul-mouthed sexual discussions in front of her."}, {"userName": "Farah *Professor Dean's Beauty*", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13273769-farah-professor-dean-s-beauty", "userReview": "I LoVED Loved LOVED this book!!

Ten stars wouldn't be enough. I loved, loved, loved Tangled. It was exactly what I needed to read right now. I am actually worried I won't be able to write something here to give it justice. Drew Evans is handsome, and knows it. He has women falling at his feet. And he doesn't believe in relationships. He never spends more than one night with a woman but always makes that night the best she has ever had. Then, he meets Katherine Brooks, Kate, and everything changes. She changes him, she is \"the one!\" Although it takes him awhile to figure that out. But, Kate is engaged to someone else, Billy. And, Kate works at Drew's firm and he has a strict rule that he does not date his co-workers. This book had me laughing out loud most of the way through. Drew is simply hilarious. The names he has for Billy go on and on. Drew has very colorful language, a hilarious way of expressing himself, most of which he says he learned in Catholic School. ha ha And most of which I can't bring myself to repeat. And, once he has finally admitted to himself that he is in love, the lengths he goes through to win Kate back are simply unbelievable. I just can't say how much I loved Drew and his antics. The entire book was told from Drew's POV. But, it was told in a different way than any other book I have read. It was told as if I was sitting in a room with Drew and he was telling the story. There are some pretty steamy sexual scenes in this book and plenty of bad language so it is most definitely for the over 18 crowd. I'm not sure if this is Emma Chase's first book or not but she hit it out of the park with this one and I cannot wait for the next book. Thank you Emma Chase for making my day yesterday spent with Drew and Kate the most fun I've had in a long time.

He lets his hookups know that he's only out for sex and usually for only one time. That is, until he meets Kate and his whole world is turned upside down. Come to find out not only is Kate engaged but she just started working for his company which is Drew's number one no-no.This book is written from Drew's POV and the author has written it so he \"talks\" to the audience. Even though that's not new, I found it really refreshing and interesting and the things that Drew says are just downright hilarious! \nMy Drew\nYummo, right? Yes...Drew is all that and he knows it and he's not shy about letting you know it. But he is in no way prepared for Kate and he is drawn to her like a moth to flame. He absolutely can not get her out of his mind and fortunately for him, it seems she feels the same way. Kate is interesting and has quite a background...but she had me at her love for the perfect pillow! Since we're essentially having the shoe on the other foot now...we don't know a lot about what she is thinking. Oh, we get the passionate kisses but she is able to reign things in...for now. Then, things happen in Kate's life and she's suddenly available. Drew tries to be a good boy and give her time especially after he walks in on her crying. Poor guy can't even last a week! But at least she did get some time! Drew and Kate together are wonderful, sweet and HOT!! Did I say hot?? W-O-W and lucky for us, the sex scenes are written by a woman because I'm not sure I could have handled them actually written by a man. I think that's my only complaint...having Drew's POV, a male's POV, we miss out on a lot of those romantic things...the sweetness and the softness and instead we get a whole bunch of TESTOSTERONE! But there is a saving grace but I'll get to that in a minute. Drew and Kate have a wonderful weekend but come Monday morning, something happens. And as usual for a man (no judgment here), Drew fears the worse and regresses to his earlier behavior causing him to come down with what he thinks is the FLU!! OMG...he is the biggest baby EVER...and I loved every moment of it! Never fear...with the help of a great set of characters (his friends and family), Drew's able to pull out of his illness and tackle his problem head on. Many kudos to him...even if he went a bit overboard! I would be remiss if I didn't talk about some of the other characters. Drew's friends are just as hilarious and while some are still players, others have settled down and/or are settling down. Matthew and Dee-Dee seem very interesting and I would love to read more about them and I even love Lexi and Steven! But my all time favorite character has to be Mackenzie! What an amazing character and I love her relationship with Drew. The cussing jar and the horse were hilarious! And something else that plays almost as important part as the characters are all the movie references. From Cinderella to Ron Burgundy, Little Mermaid to The Notebook, I loved how EC incorporated it into many of the relationships....just like real life! I loved the ending...Yay for no cliffhanger! And I think most people will be satisfied. I've heard a rumor that there may be a possible book two...that would be awesome!

IT IS A MUST READ!\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seduced a woman before.Shocking, I know.Let me clarify. I\u2019ve never had to seduce a woman before, not in the typical sense. Usually it just takes a look, a wink, a smile. A friendly greeting, maybe a drink or two. After that, the only verbal exchange involves short, one-word phrases like harder, more, lower\u2026 You get the point.\u201d\n\nDrew is a wealthy arrogant playboy that is use to getting his way. He doesn't work to get a woman to sleep with him because he is so handsome and charming that women practically beg him to sleep with them. On a weekend out on the town, he sees a woman that he needs to know, Katherine Brooks. He wants her bad and isn't unsettled by the fact that Kate is engaged because her body language is screaming that she is very much interested.

It was all completely in Drew's POV and I could not get enough of reading all of the inner ramblings of Drew's mind. The things that came out of his head... some were borderline offensive but you can't help but think it's so true. You should see how much I highlighted this book! It was quite refreshing to read how honest he was. Obviously the inner workings of a woman's and man's mind differ but I enjoyed and was fascinated being in a man's mind. I didn't want it to end!Drew was a bit of a jerk and sarcastic, but really sexy and in then end, you really can't say no to him. He was irresistible and swoony. I want to have your babies! haha! I loved how he started to change and was falling for Kate. He was a freaking idiot at one point, though. Still, I LOVE YOU!!! The way he was trying to make her fall in love with him had me sighing and laughing all at once. When he does something, he goes all out. I loved it!\n\n\u201cGod, she\u2019s beautiful. I mean, look at her. She\u2019s like a volcano going off\u2014fierce and fiery and breathtaking.

She was intelligent, kind, fiesty, and sexy. She was not afraid to be herself or work hard to get what she wants. I loved that she wanted to be independent because of how she grew up. My only complaint would be, HOW COULD YOU NOT SAY YES TO HIM, YOU CRAZY WOMAN?! Other wise, I think she kinda kicked ass.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to work together, Drew, I think we should get a few things straight. I\u2019m not your sweetheart. My name is Kate \u2014 Katherine. Use it. And I\u2019m not a kiss-ass. I don\u2019t have to be.

She kind of reminded me of my relationship with my younger brother. So I thought that was brilliant.Matthew - He had a few hilarious lines that were really great.\n\n\u201cDelores is a gorgeous name, for a gorgeous girl. Plus it rhymes with clitoris \u2026 and I really know my way around them. Big fan.\u201d \n\nSeriously, no character got on my nerve. I also need to mention that the sex scenes in his POV, were also really good! *fans self*I had so much fun reading this! I laughed, giggled, snorted, rolled my eyes, sighed, swooned and smiled so much my cheeks were hurting by the end of it. If you want a book that will lift up your spirts, this is it!
