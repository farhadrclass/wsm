I would like to thank the author for an ARC copy of this book**This is the first time I have read anything from this author. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it :) I have read other Amish books, but they were more traditional than this book. It was a little confusing at first. I have not read the first two books so I'm coming into this one trying to learn the characters. It's a stand alone book, but I like to go back and see what's what :) It seems Amber and Hannah have solved some murders and mysteries in the town before. Now Amber, is getting these cryptic messages in her email and not to tell anyone. Hannah keeps finding pies with skull signs and and poems about poisoning at the bakery. Hmmmm, it seems someone is up to no good! There is an English man/boy named Ryan going around stirring up trouble dating all of the single women in the village no matter what their ages. Hannah is trying to warn some of the women but they will hear no wrong with this man. Figures! Then there is sweet Preston who suffers from PTSD from the war. He is in love with Zoey and she with him, but he's reluctant to go any further because he has episodes of flashbacks and he passes out or destroys things. I feel bad for him. Zoey has him sign up for a working dog for those with PTSD, he doesn't want to go through with it but when he finally meets Mocha, the lab, he falls in love and understands that she does help him. A happy ending with all of them. There are quite a few people in the book that I had a hard time keeping up. I'm trying to hit on some of the main points. They all have a friend named Sarah who has cancer so they decide to hold a benefit run for cancer. This is where the murder of someone happens and they all figure out who it is, pretty cut and dry. I liked the book, but like I said I was confused on so many people and keeping up with them, so I stuck to the ones that were the major players :) This would be a good book for all mystery lovers. www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "This was just okay for me. I didn't love it....I didn't hate it. I liked the characters for the most part. They were likable. I think the main problem for me was that there were many story lines, which then needed a parade of characters to see them through. I liked the opening story, but it took the whole rest of the book to circle back around to that one. I love subplots, but because of the various story lines, I don't think that they did justice in defining the many different characters. They all started sounding similar. So 2.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16510688-elizabeth", "userReview": "Murder Freshly Baked ( An Amish Village Mystery- Book 3 )By, Vannetta ChapmanMurder Freshly baked is book three in An Amish Village Mystery series, even though it is a series you can read it as a stand alone.

Those in this community, both English and Amish, work together so well and I enjoy their bonds of friendship and faith.There are two mysteries, to solve, this time. First, someone is leaving pies around the village, along with poetic notes suggesting poison, donned the Poison Poet. Second, Ryan Duvall is shot dead as he crosses the finish line in a Race for the Cure.Whoever is leaving the pies seems especially intent on hurting Amber. Plus, does the Poison Poet have anything to do with Ryan's death? He has been dating three women, from the village, and the confrontation exposing him turns ugly.I especially enjoyed Preston receiving a service dog, Mocha, (for his PTSD) as he works his way through the trauma he experienced in Afghanistan.Since this is the last book, in the series, you will want to read how the story ends for these characters who have become like family.

The characters we've come to know and love have been targeted by someone who is placing poetic notes throughout the village, threatening that pies are laced with poison. Village manager, Amber Bowman confides in Hannah Troyer, the young Amish woman who runs the coffee shop, and the two seek to do a bit of detective work.Comparable to the previous books in this series, the author creates a series of bone-chilling mysterious events as the poison poems continue to appear. Who threatens to poison people with pie for no explainable reason, and warns them in advance? Numerous questions arise as the poems continue, and strange and serious events prove quite possible deadly intent. Though poison pies are a menace to peruse, it is the season to blossom, and love is in the air. Not all is serious with Ms. Chapman's third book in this series. Wit and humor weave their way throughout this tale of poetic promises of poisoned pies and courting couples. Accuracy and detail regarding the geographical locale and customs of the community make this a very interesting and relatable story.Faith and forgiveness are strong themes that run throughout \"Murder Freshly Baked.\" The blending of Amish and English is smooth and realistic as can be witnessed in the northern Indiana Amish community. The author's time spent in this part of the country is obvious through her authentic portrayal of the area and its people. I felt as if I'd only been gone from the Amish Artisan Village for a brief amount of time, and picked up right where I had left off. I wasn't prepared for a \"poison poet\" and the threat of poisoned pie, however! I'll be visiting this well-known community again next month, and I may hesitate just a tad before relishing my next slice of Amish pie! Five thumbs up! Get yourself a copy and enjoy this fast-paced Amish mystery!Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.

The third book, Murder Freshly Baked, is just as good as the first two. The stories center around a shopping and hotel area called Middlebury. The village employs Amish and Englishers and is a peaceful little destination except for the rash of crimes happening on site. First there was Murder Simply Brewed and then there was Murder Tightly Knit. The newest mystery involves threatening emails and letters targeting the freshly baked pies at the village.Amber, the Village manager, knows this new threat cannot be connected to the two previous issues. Who is writing these terrible poems about poison and why are they focused on her and the pies? Amber is so shaken this time that she doesn't share all the emails with her husband Tate and the local sheriff Gordon. She doesn't even fully confide in her friends and employees Hannah and Pam.Can they find the poisonous poet before there's a fatality? Will Amber continue to be personally taunted? Find the answers to these questions along with plenty of mystery and suspense when Murder Freshly Baked releases on June 9, 2015. I love these books because they are gentle reads with plenty of intrigue. The characters are well developed and enjoyable. The Village concept is unique and is a great way to combine Amish characters with Englishers.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookLook Bloggers  book review bloggers program.

I really enjoyed Murder Freshly Baked.There are a couple of different mystery themes going on in the book. One revolves around a murder and the possible reasons that it occurred. And, of course, we all want to know who did the deed! But, there is also another strange set of events taking place around the Amish Artisan Village. Threats and disturbing emails have begun to appear and are wreaking havoc with the emotions of the manager of the community, Amber.I enjoyed the mysteries that needed to be solved, but my favorite parts of this book revolved around Preston Johnstone\u2019s story. I loved learning more about him and getting to know him through the flashbacks he struggled with. His whole storyline captured me. The portions involving Hannah and Jesse also continued to be a favorite of mine.It was fun to return to this community that encompasses both Amish and Englisch. The characters feel very real and there is definitely a cozy vibe to these stories. I think the Amish Artisan Village would be a fun place to go visit\u2026the only thing holding me back is that there seems to be an inordinately high number of murders for such a charming place. ;-) But I definitely recommend reading this fun book, and the entire series, if you enjoy mysteries.My thanks to the publisher and BookLook Bloggers for the complimentary copy of this book that I received in exchange for an honest review.You can read this review on my blog at:https://brittreadsfiction.wordpress.c..."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8546014-pat", "userReview": "Do you like Warm, Cozy Mysteries?

It mentions things that happened in previous books in a way that you know what's happening in this one. If you like puzzles then beware, some of the clues may not be what you thing.The Amish Artisan Village always has something going on. Murder, poison pen letters, poison pies, someone that is playing with the hearts of more than one person. A lot of interesting things happening. Amber is the manager for the village shops and when the bakery and other establishments receive pies with notes claiming they are poisoned pies then that brings everyone together. Amber's husband Tate is always there for her. Hannah & Pam do their best to help find out what is going on. Preston's life is improving and his love for Zoey has grown since he first met her. There is humor, suspense, clues, and I can't tell you anymore without giving away the story. Needless to say I loved the book and how the characters interacted, how they relied on their faith, their friendships and how well they worked together.

Amber Bowman is the manager of The Amish Village in Middlebury, Indiana. Things have been going well for the last few months and Amber is looking forward to the weddings of her friends, Hannah and Mary. Then she starts receiving strange emails. The emails are bad poetry stating that pies and other pastries are poisoned. Then someone starts leaving pies with poetry around town. Then the Poison Poet (as they have dubbed him) starts making it personal and attacking Amber. Hannah, Tate, Amber, Jesse, Pam and friends set out to find who is behind the notes and pies. Who is the Poison Poet?Preston Johnstone is still having PTSD episodes (he was the homeless man in the first book and now works and lives in the Amish Village). He is dating Zoey Quinn who is a nurse who works at the nursing home where Preston\u2019s father lives. Zoey has found out about a special program that pairs dogs with people with PTSD. Zoey has convinced Preston to fill out an application for a dog. Preston is not sure how a dog will help him, but he is willing to give it a chance (with a lot of encouragement from Amber, Tate, and Zoey). Preston would like to get over his past so he can have a future. Hopefully, Mocha (his new PTSD dog) will help him so Preston can go after the girl of his dreams.Hannah (manager of coffee shop) and Mary (The Cat\u2019s Meow) are busy planning their weddings. They are having a double wedding. Their finance\u2019s are finishing up their rooms. They will be living at the Miller\u2019s home (the boy\u2019s parents). Hannah, Mary, Pam (assistant manager at The Village), and Amber are worried about their friends. Martha Gingerich, Letha Keim, and Georgia Small are all dating Ryan Duvall. Ryan is something of a playboy. He is Englisch and two of the girls are Amish. No one wants to see them hurt, but it is destined to happen. Ryan would never convert to the Amish faith and Martha and Letha would not want to leave the Amish. Then after Ryan finishes The Race for the Cure he is shot dead. Who killed him? Was he shot because of philandering ways or because of his gambling problem? Murder Freshly Baked is a charming novel. The book contained great, likeable characters, a little romance, a beautiful setting, and good mysteries. However, I did not enjoy this book as much as the first two in the series. I liked that Preston was getting help for his PTSD, but I did not enjoy all the scenes of his time in Afghanistan. They did not seem to go with the book (maybe if there had been only one or two scenes). I liked hearing about how dogs can help people with PTSD. What a great program.

As manager of the Village, Amber Bowman is thrilled to see the turnout--and relieved to have something to distract her from the \"Poison Poet\"--an individual who has been sending notes containing bad poetry to warn of poisoned baked goods.Then Ryan Duvall crosses the finish line of the race--and falls down dead, murdered in broad daylight. But who did it? And why? The police suspect Preston Johnston, but Amber refuses to believe her employee could do such a thing.Amber once again looks to her young Amish friend Hannah Troyer to help her find the killer--and to determine if it's the same person leaving the cryptic poems and pies.

Both Amber and Hannah will need to draw on their faith as they fight to preserve the peaceful community they've built at the Amish Artisan Village.My Review: Everyone loves a good mystery, including me. I will be the first to tell you that Vannetta Chapman is a good writer all around, but it takes a special writer to be able to hold our attention when we are reading mysteries. I really don't think and this is my personal opinion, that just anyone can write mysteries. Vannetta can deliver! Murder Freshly Baked is the third book in the series and I have read the first two and they were equally brilliant and utterly fascinating! I have always wanted to operate a bakery. I love, love, love to bake and this would be my ultimate dream. Amber Bowman learns all too quickly that not everyone has her best interests at heart, so when the Race for the Cure comes up she is happily immerses herself, thankful for the distraction. It not long after the race begins that someone is murdered and whats so strange is, is that it is done in broad daylight. Amber is sure to be on the right track in no time because she gets her Amish friend to help find the murderer.

Amber and Hannah are also concerned about the three women who work at the Amish Village who are all dating the same man. Two of the women are Amish, one of them quite a bit younger than the man in question. They just know someone is going to have their heart broken and try to warn the women. Did their warnings fall on deaf ears? The man they are dating ends up being shot as he crosses the finish line at the end of a running race in benefit of cancer research.

Meanwhile play-boy type Ryan Duvall is dating three women from the village at the same time and has no regard for their feelings when they find out about his duplicity. He feels he has done nothing wrong, until someone comes after him. Could it be a case of women scorned or is there more to the story? Is there a link between the Poison Poet and Ryan\u2019s death?The book begins with Ryan Duvall being shot just has he crosses the finish line in the race for the cure. The story then backtracks to the beginning to fill in the events leading up to this culmination. The plot is filled with twists and turns that keeps the story interesting and keeps you turning the pages. Telling Ryan\u2019s story would give away too much of the plot, but it is filled with love and forgiveness along with a good dose of God\u2019s marvelous redeeming grace.

I had never read an Amish murder mystery, so I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised.What I found were characters with depth to them as evidenced by their interactions as they helped one another with their sometimes intensely difficult personal situations. The novel was more than just about the murder; it was about the community of people.This was the third book in the series of Amish-style detective work that main characters Amber and Hannah were involved in trying to track down a killer. But this killer hasn\u2019t killed anyone yet. This killer keeps leaving poetic notes and a pie warning that the pie is poisoned.This novel is not fast-paced, but flows along at a pleasant speed for the type of read that it is. There is some romance between a few of the characters and as the author herself says, it is fiction full of grace.While this is a novel that fits in the genre of Christian fiction, it certainly does not preach at you. Whatever you believe I think you will find this book an enjoyable read. I liked that the author used some of the words the Amish use and provided a glossary. The words were linked to the glossary so it made looking up the word very easy if you were not able to figure it out from context. The use of these words in the conversations between the characters helped to give a more authentic feel to their Amish heritage.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Murder Freshly Baked. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Amish novels, or to anyone who wants to try something a little different along the lines of a murder mystery.

This is the third in the series but it can be read alone. Vannetta Chapman gives enough background information that you don't feel lost. Amber (English) and manager of the village, and Hannah (Amish) who is employed in one of the shops, have become very close friends. They have worked together trying to solve two murders that have happened in the village over the past year. Now they are faced with a \"poison poet\" who has been sending threatening poems to Amber's email address as well as leaving pies with poems at different places in the village. Each poem indicates that the pie is filled with a different type poison from arsenic to antifreeze. Amber is on edge and stressed out because the poet has threatened her if she brings anyone else in on her emails. Word gets out because of the pies showing up in various places which brings in Gordon, the chief of police.The story is a great page turner, leaving the reader guessing at every incident on who the poet might be. I had no clue, although I did venture a few guesses in my mind, all wrong though. That to me makes a great mystery. And there is a murder. By pie, or some other means, you'll just have to read to find out.I love the fact that the author ties up all the loose ends and finishes the story to the point that all the questions I had in my mind while reading are answered.

So over all, I am very glad that I did finish the book for the last three chapters were my favorite. And who does not like a good ending overall?On a side note \"Murder Freshly Baked\" was released on my birthday this year. I look forward to reading more books written by Vannetta Chapman in the near future.I received a free copy of this book through NetGalley for an honest review. No money was exchanged.

Sweetly passionate romance, two puzzling mysteries, a dash of tangible tension, a handful of selfless friendships, and just the right amount of witty humor all mix together to produce a delicious story that you won\u2019t want to put down.I just really love these characters! The interactions between Amish and Englisch (non-Amish) are natural and refreshing, especially in today\u2019s world where differences so publicly divide. The sincerity and genuineness of their friendships warms the reader despite the suspense and adds elements of humor in the midst of tension (Pam\u2019s reactions while being held hostage by a paintball attack comes to mind here).One thing that kept coming to mind across all three books in this Amish Village series is the \u201cAgatha Christie\u201d feel to the writing, the atmosphere, the cases, even the characters. It delighted me in Murder Freshly Baked to see several references to Agatha Christie, my favorite being when Hannah mentioned Amber loaning her some of the mystery author\u2019s books. I just knew they had to be mystery readers, too! All the best amateur sleuths are, of course.The entire Amish Village series is a must read for both Agatha Christie/Sherlock Holmes fans and Amish genre fans!(I received a copy of the book from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for only my honest review.)Read my full review here: https://readingismysuperpower.wordpre..."}, {"userName": "Vera Godley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6214962-vera-godley", "userReview": "In this third book in the Amish Artisan Village series, Vannetta Chapman brings us back into the presence of the employees of the Village and their interactions as another unthinkable event occurs in this peaceful setting - murder.The Amish are a peace loving and peaceful group who set themselves apart from the modern world by shunning many modern conveniences. They live by a strict code based on Biblical principles. In the Village, there is close mingling of regular folks and Amish as they work, visit, and shop the various stores and restaurants in the Village. Two Amish couples are looking forward to their soon to occur wedding. A returned veteran struggles with PTSD. The Village manager becomes embroiled in threats seemingly directed at her. A complicated mixture of situations that need resolution.To me the highlight of this book is how Preston, the veteran, deals with his traumatic experiences of flashbacks that are violent. The entrance of Mocha, a service dog that is provided to Preston is interesting and lovable. This is a stand alone story, but it would be more interesting for the reader to have previously read books one and two since references to those stories occur. I always enjoy a Vannetta Chapman book and can heartily recommend it.GIVEAWAY - CLICK HERE http://chatwithvera.blogspot.com/2015...DISCLOSURE: I was provided a complimentary copy by the author to facilitate this review.

Who doesn't love delicious Amish pie? Not when there is poison in the pie or when there is a threat of poison in the pie. This third book in the Amish Village Mystery series is serving up pies that no one is eager to eat! Amber is once again thrown into the midst of a huge and dangerous mystery and she is determined to solve it! I love a good mystery. I love a good Amish mystery. Vannetta Chapman is a true expert at creating Amish mysteries. This time she is serving up a mystery in an Amish pie....or two! I get so caught up in the mystery and the lives of the main characters. It has been great fun to get to return to the Amish village and to see the happenings in the lives of those who work there. It also made me hungry for an Amish pie. I might just have to head out to our local Amish store and find a strawberry-rhubarb pie! This is a delightful and dangerous novel. I rated it 5 stars and am thrilled to recommend it to readers who enjoy a good mystery.I received a free kindle version of this book from netgalley in exchange for my honest review.

This is one of the Amish Village Mysteries. The first two were, Murder Simply Brewed and Murder Tightly Knit.Even if you haven't read these two books you won't be lost in this book, Murder freshly Baked, because each book is a stand a lone read even though it's about the same village. So, you might see names that are familiar, but each mystery is different and about a particular someone in the community.This was a fun read for me. The Amber begins to get poetic notes that inform her not to sell her bakery goods...that pies have been poisoned. Amber is confused about who would poison pies and why leave poems to inform her that they are poisoned? But this is a serious crime. And Amber doesn't want innocent people hurt of killed so she enlists Hannah Troyer's help so that they can try and find out what is happening and why the bakery is involved.This was a great mystery! Probably my most favorite of them all. Maybe, because I could smell the baked good and imagine the wonderful pies. *This book was provided for review by BookLook*"}, {"userName": "Sunnie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3909679-sunnie", "userReview": "An Amish Village Mystery. Book 3This was another great book from Vannetta Chapman. As in every book that I have read which was written by her, I have been so impressed with her wonderful writing talents. This book is a continuation from book 2. Hannah and Amber again find themselves in a very strange situation as poetic \"Poison Pen letters\" are found with freshly baked pies. The poem indicates the pie has been laced with something that will poison the person that eats it. Who would warn people of such a strange thing?Amber finds mysterious emails and her cat is poisoned. But who is behind this? There is a little romance, mystery and lots of great reading to be found in this book. I enjoyed revisiting Vannetta's Amish village. I hope the series will continue!Author Vannetta Chapman has penned a great book here and I am sure you will enjoy it as well!I received the book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.

To start the fun, a mystery person is sending threats in bad rhyme about poison pies in Middlebury, Indiana at the Amish Village. Some of the notes are quite comical, but it isn\u2019t initially clear whether they are the work of a prankster or would be killer. But all is not light-hearted as the story unwinds.I enjoy the interaction and friendship between the Amish and the English (that\u2019s all of us non-Amish). The characters are interesting and I felt like I knew them personally. I felt fear, joy and sadness for them.This is the third book in the Amish Village Series, but can be read alone and enjoyed. There is danger, intrigue, romance and some serious moments discussing PTSD and cancer. If you like a good clean mystery, get your hands on this great book."}, {"userName": "Tess", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2598171-tess", "userReview": "I have to admit that cozy mysteries are my first love, following very close are books about the Amish. My mother was born very near to the Amish community in east central Illinois. Now my husband and I live in that same area. I had always felt that that was where I belonged. To see the Amish working in their stores and shops, is something that everyone needs to see. A lot of the roads around here have an extra lane for the Amish buggies. Amber and Hannah find themselves wrapped up in some mysterious notes that warn that pies in the village may be poisoned. No shop or store is left out of this threat. Amber and Hannah work with the police to save their village and the residents.If you haven't read any of Vannetta's Amish books, please try to. I can tell that Vannetta has spent a lot of time researching the books.
