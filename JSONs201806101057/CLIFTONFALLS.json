The economy of the town is based on farming and one of the town\u2019s most well-known farmers is Blake. Farming is not an easy game and Blake needs to find a new way to increase his yearly yield and protect his crops from a menacing insect that is poised to destroy them. Blake comes across a new fertiliser that is designed to kill these bugs and help his crops grow. He manages to secure the first batch of fertiliser that is released for public use and spreads it on his vast crops and fields. Blake even gives some of the fertiliser to his wife\u2019s boss Vincent, so he can use it on his garden. Vincent has been putting off doing the gardening. His mother died recently and her final wish was to be buried in the garden of the house that she had lived in (the house in which Vincent now owns!). Even now after a few months, Vincent is still freaked out that his mother is buried in the garden! Nevertheless, Vincent finally plucks up the courage and uses the fertiliser to try and reinvigorate the plants he has recently being neglecting. Unluckily for Vincent, his hard work does not pay off as a storm washes away most of the fertiliser whilst the rest just soaks into the soil.What Blake and Vincent don\u2019t realise is that the fertiliser contains a dangerous chemical called Moltovenium. When this new chemical comes into contact (with the help of the storm) with dead cells, it reanimates them causing the corpse to come back to life! What\u2019s even worse is that the newly revived bodies come back to life with a hunger for human flesh and will do anything to get it! One of the first zombies to rise is Vincent\u2019s mother and unfortunately for Vincent and his wife, the reunion is not a happy one.With the zombie epidemic in full flow, the local police force is tasked with keeping the virus inside Clifton Falls and preventing it from spreading to the local city. But when the fertiliser washes down to the local cemetery, the task is made much, much harder as a dozen new ghouls are brought back to life. The fate of human kind is held in the hands of the local Police Chief Mike, but this fate does not look good with these cunning and devious zombies out on the hunt!I really enjoyed reading Clifton Falls! I have never really read a horror book before but have always wanted to. I think that is because there are so many good horror books out there and I never knew where to start. I\u2019m glad I waited and luckily read Clifton Falls because it was such a good read! I really liked how the novel was set in a small town, which I thought made the book and the reactions of the characters much more believable. I also liked the fact that the book wasn\u2019t over gory on the zombie killing front. I think, especially in films and games, the zombie genre sometimes ends up more about the killing and violence instead of actually sticking to the story of the epidemic and the characters. I think Taylor did a great job of telling the story with some gory scenes, which made the book really interesting and thrilling to read. There was also some humour in the novel. This further made it exciting to read and helped balance the book from it just been a horror novel and again made it much more believable.However, I did have one little issue with the book and that was when the characters (especially the police officers) came across a zombie. They would nearly always be sneaked up on, go to get their gun out, fail to shot and then be attacked. It sort of made me think \u2018Just shoot it!\u2019 but instead they\u2019d stand there looking at it! I just thought that if I was in that situation I\u2019d either run or shoot, whereas most of the officers just stood there!Nevertheless, this was just a small issue and all in all I really enjoyed the book! I would like to say a massive thank you to Lee Taylor for getting in touch and being patient with my review! I\u2019d suggest this book to anyone who enjoys reading horror novels or to anyone who is a fan of movies like Dawn of the Dead or Resident Evil.For more great book reviews check out http://adam-p-reviews.blogspot.co.uk/"}, {"userName": "Brianna Lee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9708137-brianna-lee", "userReview": "\u201cClifton Falls\u201d by Lee TaylorI received this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.Lee Taylor created a horror story about zombies, with just the right amount of gore. Alongside the gore, there was some humor thrown in. I thought that the gore and humor created a good balance for this zombie tale. I know there are many zombie books out lately, but when I read paranormal, I tend to read about vampires and werewolves so I enjoyed jumping into this zombie fiction. I liked Mr. Taylor\u2019s reason for the dead rising to feed off the living \u2013 the fertilizer was a good twist. I also enjoyed how it seemed to have two stories told side by side until they met as one. The pace was set nicely which made it a good read. The action throughout \u201cClifton Falls\u201d went well with the pace. I would rate Lee Taylor\u2019s novel 3.5 STARS overall. I thought that a few characters could have been left out of this story completely \u2013 or at least not focused on as much. However, that did not take away from me enjoying this tale. I just believe it would be better for the author to be less wordy in future works and to select what is important in the final edit. As I said, I did enjoy \u201cClifton Falls\u201d by Lee Taylor. I will be reading more of his books and adding any new ones to my TBR (To Be Read) list. If you are looking for an action filled, gory yet humorous zombie tale, then I suggest giving Lee Taylor\u2019s \u201cClifton Falls\u201d a try now!Brianna Lee Book Reviewshttp://www.briannaleereviews.blogspot..."}, {"userName": "Heather Alexander", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9323924-heather-alexander", "userReview": "First there is a violent bank robbery in the small town of Clifton Falls that results in a death. Next the zombies, a result of experimental fertilizer show up. The local police hole up in the hospital to fight the zombies, they have to find a way to destroy the zombies and keep them from getting out of the town. As if that wasn't enough, the bank robbers are back for their stolen loot. The police now have zombies and bank robbers to deal with. This book has a cool concept, I love a good zombie book. The fact that it has the extra side story was interesting. I did think the book had a bit too much detail. I am not a huge fan of knowing about every crease in a person's face, their whole background or what color the floor is. Other than that, I enjoyed the book. I liked that it had action, violence (as a zombie book should),some comedy and that extra oomph from the bank robbers. The characters were interesting and the story original for what it is. I will check out more by this author for sure."}, {"userName": "Darren", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11104029-darren", "userReview": "A novel of graphic violence with plenty of black comedy, definitely worth 5 out of 5 stars. At times I could not read the story for laughing. The local Chief Inspector with ever dwindling human resources tries to save his small rural town Clifton Falls, from a zombie epidemic. The zombies are not your usual run of the mill \"zombie\"; they exhibit some intelligence and use it to their advantage. Taylor is a relative newcomer to the horror genre deserves to be to read by a huge audience. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading horror novels - especially Zombie novels - or to anyone who is a fan of the movie 'Shaun of the Dead' (2004)."}, {"userName": "Johnny Andrews", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6398795-johnny-andrews", "userReview": "This is a fun zombie read, placing it in the confines of a small village like community, which gives it a different pace as there is no built up cities for the virus to spread, no army blockades and what not that you usually get with the zombie genre. So it may take a couple of reads to get your head around something a little more original and that is the only reason it has 4 stars instead of 5. But I urge you all to read this book with characters so human you may as well laugh with them to hide your fears and unease to what they are trying to cope with.A nice build up to different type of ending."}, {"userName": "L.A.

The action, the plot, the sub-plot, the characters, are all beneficial to the success of this classic story. Although the writer is unknown at the moment, i'm sure after reading this you will think they should be up there with the greats.

With all the zombie books, TV shows, movies, it's an especially interesting topic. And Taylor's book has more substance than most Zombie stories. The characters are well developed and his writing seems effortless. I could totally imagine the people, the town, the whole nightmare taking place.Great book.

The writing is not great. Also, still no zombies, nothing's happening that seems to make sense.
