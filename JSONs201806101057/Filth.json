Now if that means he's got to: lie, cheat, steal, manipulate and back-stab his way there, then you can safely bet that he will. The media sensitive murder investigation of a black tourist might cause some trouble, but that's not going to stop him enjoying his week holiday of drinking and whoring in the 'Dam!It is refreshing from time to time to read a first person perspective of a complete and utter Cunt. He is a user, a misogynist, a racist, a drug user, and an abuser. All the things (most) people aren't. And he's unashamedly so as well, he has no qualms with lying or betraying his friends in his selfish designs. Bruce Robertson is the type of controversial character that although despicable you just can't ignore. He is just so reprehensible and disgusting, and that's before we get onto the rash on his cock or the tapeworm growing in his stomach.A truly inspired idea to give consciousness to the Tapeworm. Bruce is all but lacking a conscience. There is no Jiminy Cricket sitting on his shoulder telling him right from wrong, but there is a Tapeworm who refers to itself as The Self. Like the reader, the Tapeworm learns more and more about Bruce as the book continues. In the end it's the worm who is Bruce's advocate and perhaps last remaining meaningful contact as Bruce has all but fucked over every human being he has came across.Despite the drugs, meaningless affairs, betrayals and tortures 'Filth' is actually very funny. Irvine Welsh has a flair for dialogue that cuts to the bone and a writing style that engrosses the reader. Forthright and unabashed in it's overtly controversial opinions, it stands out like the best stand up comedian. Daring to be dark, disgusting, and horrible; saying and doing things so that the reader (or any well adjusted member of society) does not have to. I'm glad my friends put me onto this book otherwise I might never have picked it up. Irvine Welsh is better known for his more famous novel, 'Trainspotting', something which is more of a story OUT of darkness. 'Filth' is the opposite, it is a descent INTO darkness. A story of loss told through abuse, consumption, self loathing and Tapeworms.You are unlikely to find a book like it."}, {"userName": "Steven Stennett", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18562660-steven-stennett", "userReview": "I have never been so glad to finish a book.

As many said before me the book perfectly corresponds to the title; filth. There is nothing I've read before that so perfectly illustrates utter and complete burn out. Our protagonist, Bruce is a cop whose life is in ruins, his wife left him, he drinks, takes drugs and fucks whores, on top of that there is eczema all over his privates and a tapeworm in his guts.Reading this is like fast forwarding on a nightmare where the same elements keep repeating and everything spirals out of control slowly. Bruce hates everything and everyone and his only joy left is making people's live hell around him with perfectly planned scheming. Most if not all of his thoughts are racist, misogynistic,homophobic, hateful, angry and nihilistic. At a certain point the only sound of reason is the tapeworm inside him. The ending brings a true catharsis, it shows that the things that happened weren't just pointless rants from the writer and one could close the book with a sense of every piece falling to its place. Welsh's writing is incredibly powerful, it swept me away and I kept reading it compulsively to the very last page.

But I loved the shocking twist and its completely original narrative style. And how Bruce and the tapeworm slowly were submerging until the tapeworm got louder until both ineviteablye died was brilliant in the overall feeling of human waste taking over.I felt like I needed a shower after every read but I never grew bored or offended enough to put it down. Bruce reminded me of a dirty Scottish version Patrick Bateman.I love Irvine's style and his straight fowardness.He never holds back and isnt afraid to take a dip in the filth of human exsistance that everyone denies but what ulitimately make us human.I would recommend it to any cynical,dry humored reader like myself and can say that those of us would enjoy it thoroughly."}, {"userName": "Radwa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5591839-radwa", "userReview": "\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0631\u064a\u0641\u064a\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irtni...It's my first Irvine Welsh read and I'm sure it's the last.

Put that on the side, he's got a worm growing inside him, and we see him changing and \"interacting\" with that worm. Both the beginning and the ending were great, which I thoroughly enjoyed despite the accent which was extremely hard for me to read and get through.This is an interesting novel with an interesting concept, the \"worm\" part definitely added more to the story, since we only manage to know more of Bruce and his history through that worm!

The main reason is Bruce Robertson, the main character of \"Filth\".Bruce Robertson is a Police Investigator in Edinburgh. He's also, in every sense of the word, the WORST human being you can imagine. He's depraved, completely void of morality, racist, and worst of all, believes in what he does. Reading this book actually makes you fearful that there are people out there like this in positions of power. His actions are awe-inducing in their maliciousness. Sometimes they are horrifying. And amazingly, if you \"connect\" with this book (not everybody will), you will actually laugh out loud. Sometimes at yourself when you come to the realization that you are actually finding humor in his actions. In my adventures of reading modern fiction, I don't think I've ever come across such a horrible creation such as Bruce Robertson. He is filth.That said, what a thrill this book was, and what a thrill it is to discover a novelist such as Irvine Welsh! He's drunk on the possibilities of language, and that's what makes this book so special. He makes it bearable to co-exist with Bruce Robertson for almost 400 pages because he writes in such a way that gets you on the same wavelength as his character. And as Bruce finds justification in his actions and philosophies, even if you don't as a reader, you are still right there with him the entire time. The Scottish dialect is easy to get used to, and adds so much to the authenticity and grit to the story. Couple all of this with a truly satisfying ending, and this is one of the most fun and memorable reads I've come across. I'll surely be seeking out more Irvine Welsh to read as well.Update: 24 hours have passesd since I finished \"Filth\" and wrote the review above. As the book continues to linger on my mind, I find myself feeling more and more sympathy for Bruce. Truly the mark of a good book...that it remains with you and continues to make you think."}, {"userName": "Xandra", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6600821-xandra", "userReview": "A few years back I was watching some pissed off religious zealot going all loony on TV because gays were having their little pride parade (oh, the horror!) and proposing they should all be sent to the desert or be given a country - Australia, he suggested (!!) - to inhabit. Maybe I should have been outraged, but I couldn't stop laughing to tears at the poor ignorant fool and his unbelievable stupidity. Some people are so deranged, you just can't take them seriously.My reaction to Bruce Robertson was not much different. Yes, he's a misanthrope, a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a cokehead, a liar, a scum. Everything you despise in a human being. He's the lowest form of life possible. His words, thoughts and actions end up with you angry and repulsed and swallowing back a bit of your own vomit. You sure don't empathize with him because you're a decent human being who's probably been sheltered from this kind of guys and lived surrounded by smiles and happiness. And if you can't empathize with the scumbag character you might not like the book. You might even fall into the trap and get the impression that the book promotes hatred and glamorizes despicable behavior. But I think the difference between right and wrong is clearly defined here: it's wrong what Bruce thinks and does, it's right what Bruce says mockingly, when he contradicts his own regular dirty thoughts. Thoughts that are not beliefs, though. They're just a form of self-defense, because at his (deep) core, Bruce is a good man. With huge issues and a ton of bad luck.Bruce is not to be taken seriously, he's not where you draw your morals from (that would be Drummond, Bruce's antagonist).

The constant series of horrors (which are entertaining and shocking to begin with) become something that you are accustomed to, the horror you were feeling at his physical/mental state and his actions towards others to begin with becomes dull.Maybe this is a statement in itself about human nature when faced with atrocities over which we have no control, like the heavy descriptive prose in American Psycho, but like AP, the point had been made quite a while before anything came of it.However, you can see I've given it four stars, and this is because the last hundred pages are truly excellent.

It says almost everything I want to say about the book, so I thought it was worth reproducing here. Enjoy: Imagine the best thing you\u2019ve ever done; imagine the most energy you\u2019ve ever expended; imagine the ultimate expression of your greatest skill: now multiply that by a one hundred and it\u2019s a good bet you still won\u2019t even come close to the level of Tam Dean Burn\u2019s performance in Filth.His performance is not acting. It is transformation.From the moment he struts into his onstage office, briefcase and brown paper bag in hand, lays his first fart and offers advice on how to escape the smell, Tam Dean Burn disappears into the skin and loathsome psyche of Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson. Robertson \u2013 the anti-hero of Harry Gibson\u2019s adaptation of Filth, Irvine Welsh\u2019s merciless novel of police corruption \u2013 is one of the most vile characters ever to hit the stage. He makes Tartuffe and Richard III look like a couple of petulant schoolboys playing tricks on their neighbours. And, more frightening still, he\u2019s an invisible monster that walks among us.Over the course of a Christmas season Robertson ruins the life of a colleague, starts shagging his friend\u2019s wife, battles an intestinal parasite, snorts a whole mess of coke, bites out a guy\u2019s tongue, engages in a bloodthirsty act of defenestration, and rapes a girl while his partner busts another for the same crime. And this tally only scratches the surface of the sins, bloodshed and hate that find their expression in Burn\u2019s uncompromising performance.The degradation of Detective Sergeant Robertson goes well beyond the physical, however. As Tam Dean Burn taps into each of the thirty-two characters that live in Robertson\u2019s world and mind we come to realize that this filthy cop is not just evil \u2013 he is certifiably mad. And Burn internalizes this madness with a physical and mental energy that\u2019s humbling to witness, committing himself fully to being Bruce Robertson. Indeed, once onstage, Burn shows no trace at all of the beneficent actor from Leith who fights for equality and peace. All that\u2019s left is a beast who shifts from perversion to corruption and back again. Yet, somehow, as with the classic misanthropes that Bruce Robertson eclipses, the audience finds themselves empathizing with the mad Detective Sergeant \u2013 and maybe even liking him. And therein lies the true effectiveness of Tam Dean Burn\u2019s performance. We witness DS Robertson\u2019s appalling actions, but Burn makes us believe that somewhere inside, beneath all the hate and anger, a good man, a sane man, is struggling for supremacy. Filth takes us right to the precipice, to the edge of lunacy and horror, and Burn pulls us back. In the hands of a lesser actor Welsh\u2019s story could easily spiral out of control. The mirror balls and talking tapeworms, the masturbation and nudity, the ultra violence and disturbing revelations could overwhelm us with hopelessness. But Tam Dean Burn keeps us with him all the way. He makes us believe in the struggling core of Robertson\u2019s goodness, and he shows us that hope can come from even the most tragic events.Filth is not an entertaining play. It\u2019s not an easy play to watch. But the questions and ethical dilemmas it raises are relevant to us all. And it contains the finest stage performance this city has seen. Tam Dean Burn is unparalleled. It\u2019s no wonder Harry Gibson wrote Filth with him in mind."}, {"userName": "Kaita", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48642327-kaita", "userReview": "*Edit* I haven't been able to get this book out of my head, which is something that not a lot of books can claim to do to me, so I'm changing my rating to Five Stars, but keeping the review as is. 4.75 / 5 (if you can finish it)This novel took two attempts to read it and several years, plus the release of the movie, to successfully restart and complete it.Filth was the most roller-coaster-like novel I have ever read. It is written with two perspectives, though Bruce Robertson's is the dominant one. The best way to describe how this novel is reading it is like getting to know someone. The further you delve into their story, the more you see a person fractured. The more reason you see behind their actions, the better you understand how they think, everything.The only novels I can think of that would be even close to this ball park are The Catcher In The Rye and The Perks Of Being A Wallflower. That is, if you injected a whole new level of crazy and desperation into those stories, and then left the protagonists and their lives to rot for 20-30 years.

Well my Dad wasn't a corrupt cop, he was a lawyer, but he always struggled with his working class background and wanting to leave it behind. Telling you the most brilliant thing about this novel would spoil the whole thing. So I will only say this: Welsh presents the main character in a very complex way, and he is not a likable guy. But ultimately you have decide is he a monster, a victim, or what? Welsh experiments with intestinal worms. I am not sure whether it really works. Well some of the best parts of the story are in the intestinal worms, and it definitely drives home the message: you are what you eat. But then they make the story fragmented and confusing. Still you have to figure that someone as coke addled and sleep deprived as the main character of this tale is going to experience life as confusing and fragmented.

Bruce is in line for a big promotion to DI, and will stop at nothing to get it. Eliminating the competition with psychopathic precision, whilst indulging in his own sordid urges (booze, sex, cocaine and a bit of the old ultraviolence), it seems hard to make this character relatable or even that likeable. However, through Welsh's horrific but poignant stream-of-consciousness writing, Bruce is not only irresistibly interesting, but also tragically pitiable. As we hear Bruce's traumatic origins (narrated by the self-conscious tapeworm swimming through our misogynistic anti-hero's belly), he becomes less of an amoral Dracula and more like a miserable Frankenstein's Monster. For me, THIS was the most intriguing part of the story.(SPOILERS)The bastard son of the serial rapist 'The Beast' who raped his young mother, Bruce was treated as such by his father and pretty much everyone else who knew him. All they could see was the face of the demonic criminal who had disgraced an innocent young woman. As his younger brother was basked in attention and love, Bruce was abused, ignored and even forced to eat coal. The worst part for me was that Bruce didn't even seem to know why this was. He would look in the mirror, desperately looking for what everybody else saw in him that was so 'wrong', so 'sick', so 'filthy'. All he could see was a sad, little boy who seemed incapable of being loved by anyone. Going back to my 'Frankenstein' thing, I see The Beast as being the Doctor and Bruce being The Creature, something which should never have been given life, that would be destined to live a cursed life if it did, that would be hated, that would be feared, that would drive everybody who he cares for away from him. When Bruce visits his real father in prison and begins beating on him, I think it is less to do with what he did to his mother and more the fact that he brought him into the world in the first place. He resents his own life. As a result, like the Creature and Milton's Satan, 'evil became (his) good'. At the end of the book, Robbo's suicide seems to be a petty way of getting back at his ex-wife. In the recent film adaptation with James McAvoy, however, it seems more like a genuine cat of repentance and redemption, which I think fits in well with this backstory. He sees himself as 'wrong', which ultimately he must put 'right', by ending it... but, that's just my view.The book was fantastic! I was a little disturbed by it at times (and even began questioning my own sanity during my reading of it), but it is a brilliant character study, a black comic tour-de-force and a brilliant introduction to Welsh's twisted, psycho-punk universe!... just try not too get too sucked into Robbo's head... it may be difficult to get out."}, {"userName": "Kevin Rubin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6110981-kevin-rubin", "userReview": "\"Filth,\" by Irivine Welsh certainly lived up to its name. Pretty filthy, in several ways the word can be used, from beginning to end.It's told in first person by the main character, Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson of the Leith Police, who's approaching middle age and is one of the detectives competing for the single available promotion to Detective Inspector. He feels he's entitled to it because he gave up a few years of rank by working in Australia when his wife Carole wanted to live near her Mum down there.Sometime before the beginning of the story Carole has gone away to spend some time with her Mum, who's back in Scotland, and Bruce is on his own. Unfortunately, he doesn't know how to cook or use the machine to wash clothes and as the story progresses his clothes get filthier and filthier, and with his bachelor lifestyle, that's mud, food, sweat, semen, alcohol and anything else that could possibly spill\u2026Bruce isn't a very nice guy, either. He's mean, vicious, vulgar, racist, sexist, alcoholic, wasted on cocaine and wants that promotion. He's in charge of a racial murder that's taken place does what he can to put his colleagues in situations to keep them from getting their job done.For himself, almost every day he starts work late, goes for long, alcoholic lunch breaks and usually knocks off early so he can go shag some woman or watch some adult videos at home. About the most work he seems to do is filling in his overtime pay forms.At the beginning he's in charge of everything around him, but slowly through the novel everything degenerates. We see, from his eyes, what even he doesn't see himself as he loses control and that his coworkers he considers pathetic are much more on top of things than he is\u2026Welsh is crude, vulgar, sick and very filthy in this book, and spins out a fantastic tale."}, {"userName": "Oleksii", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22123282-oleksii", "userReview":
