Kate Vaiden isn\u2019t your typical genteel lady of \u201cCold Sassy Tree,\u201d or \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d Most of Kate\u2019s story takes place in the late 30\u2019s, but she has a thoroughly modern independent nature; one that today\u2019s woman could easily identify with. Narrated in the first person, it\u2019s the story of a Southern girl, who is raised by relatives, following the death of her parents by murder-suicide. Kate seems strangely detached, and at first, this made her feel foreign to me. She is, at best, like semi-sweet chocolate; something I am intensely attracted to and repelled by, at the same time. Like looking at a bug too long under a looking glass, perhaps studying Kate made me feel a bit squirmy. It didn\u2019t take me long to discover that there is a bit of Kate in all of us, and very likely, a lot of her in most of us. It was, after all, her guilt that I felt most keenly. Perhaps like Kate, I have chosen not to seek it out; for any child that has lost a parent can ask you, why they should still be here, while the parent is not. Placed on my bookshelf to read again, Kate Vaiden will seduce you with her charm and invite you to share her pain, but don\u2019t expect her to stick around for the ending."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "3 1/2 stars  I couldn't quite figure out what I thought of it as a whole, because there was so much about it that I loved---especially the Southern flavor, the occasional laugh-out-loud humor, and the style of writing that is so different from other authors. But the whole is definitely less satisfying than its parts. I liked Kate better as a young girl than as a woman.The book has a strong orphan/abandonment theme that's very interesting to follow. You can't really dislike Kate, and yet there seems to be something fundamentally missing from her personality. Hard to tell if she was born that way or if being orphaned at age eleven made her that way. She's the most impulsive character I've ever encountered. She uses people when she needs them, and then just picks up and disappears whenever things get uncomfortable or she's \"used them up.\" This would be an excellent book for a book group to read and discuss. Even for group members who may not love the book, there would be MUCH to pick apart."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth (Alaska)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska", "userReview": "I had no expectations for this book. It was a gift, and one I likely would not have chosen for myself. It is written in the first person from the perspective of a 57-year old woman who wants to tell about her life. She really only tells about her life from age 11 to about age 20, then there are some 20 pages covering the next nearly 40 years. I can only describe it as a coming-of-age story - a type of story I prefer to skip. I didn't want a longer story, I just wanted more of the adult Kate Vaiden.I think it is unusual when a woman writes successfully from a man's perspective and vice versa. While this male author didn't get Kate quite right, in my opinion, he did better than some attempts I've read. There is enough dialogue throughout that I remarked to myself Price thankfully did not descend into regional dialect, and he especially did not denigrate Noony, the black servant, by having her speak pidgin English. The narrative itself was written with a certain \"rural southern\" cadence, but my reading ear was attuned within a very few pages. It may have been this that lent more reality to the story than anything else.While I did not especially care for this, I will give it 3 stars. For me, it languishes toward the bottom of that range. 3 stars is supposed to mean OK, and I suppose it as at least that, though I am obviously a tad reluctant in saying so. There are other reviews by those who thought better of it. If it looks in the least interesting to you, you owe yourself a moment to read one or two of them."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed", "userReview": "Ah, Kate breaks your heart, over and over.

The novel opens with Kate in her late fifties. She takes us back in time, recalling her turbulent life beginning at the age of eleven when she loses both her parents to a murder-suicide. Kate is then raised in a loving environment by her aunt and uncle in the small town of Macon, North Carolina. Kate has her first sexual encounter with a young man who later dies in a military training camp during the Vietnam war. Not long after, she runs away to live with her uncle and his friend, gets pregnant at the age of 16, and runs away again. And so begins a series of events in which Kate ricochets from one attachment to another, runs away for no apparent reason, immerses herself in another attachment only to run away again. Meanwhile, she has abandoned her baby infant with her aunt and doesn\u2019t consider contacting her son until he is in his mid-thirties when she is in her late fifties having received a diagnosis for cervical cancer. Kate drifts aimlessly from one situation to another. And yet wherever she lands, she seems to find men who are attracted to her and who desire her company. She flees from any sort of commitment but doesn\u2019t provide a plausible explanation for doing so, leaving the reader baffled and frustrated at her behavior. She emerges as an unlikable, selfish, ungrateful, and self-absorbed character. Her constant running away and haphazard choices in life make it hard to sympathize with her. She is an aimless drifter, bolting whenever she whiffs a relationship getting too close for comfort. Now that she is middle-aged, now that she is staring cancer in the face, she tries to reconnect with people in her past who loved her and showed her kindnesses only to discover they have all since died: her aunt and uncle who took her in when she was orphaned and their neighbor, Fob, who gifted her a horse when she was a teenager. She plans to reconnect with her son. But the belated emergence of concern for people in her past, people she had abandoned for over thirty-five years, appears self-serving and underlines her selfishness. It all seems too little, too late.The novel was okay but not something I would necessarily recommend."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/544978-john", "userReview": "A winner of the National Bokk Critics Circle Award this is painfully obvious story of the title character, Kate Vaiden. Reynolds Price amongst his many academic accomplishments holds a named chair as a professor a Duke. My own digression here - his brief bio in the back of the book reads much more like a senior CV for someone applying for a prestigious position in order to inculcate the ignorant masses.  A well wrought story that is written by the protagonist as means of explanation to the son that she abandoned 40 years ago it traces the tragedy of the life of Kate Vaiden. Set in the rural hinterlands (i.e. read backwater small town) of North Carolina it gets going early with the double murder-suicide of her parents at age 11. Further hardships follow, many bittersweet. Throughout the novel Kate continues to struggle towards stability, only to erratically take flight without warning when it comes close. Ultimately there are as many warm hopeful aspects to this work as there are bitter loss. I particularly was drawn to the countless imaginative (at least to a relatively urban Yankee) comparisons and similies, and Price has a writing style that is evocative and original."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96892-jennifer", "userReview": "Reynolds Price introduces us to one of the most complex, well-developed characters I have ever had the pleasure to read. Kate Vaiden gives birth to a baby boy in Macon, NC at the tender age of 17. Already she has experienced more tragedies than most adults, which may arguably help to explain why she abandons her son. As the rest of the world lives in WWII, Kate struggles with her own confusing choices and grows up to be a heroine you will sympathize with as well as want to smack. She is a complex, strong, independent, smart, and stupid woman that you will find yourself trying to understand from chapter one. The people involved in Kate's World (and it really is Kate's World) are also extremely well-written, thought-out characters.A perfect book to be discussed in book groups or literature classes, as it is entertaining while able to sink your teeth into- lots of layers to ponder!

It was so much a book of words rather than a book with a plot.The plot was slow, but the words, phrases and images Price uses are rich and evoke strong feelings and paint images in the readers eye. I had difficulty at first because he writes in such an unusual way. He does not write \"she is sad\"- instead he creates an image totally unrelated to sadness that brings out the feeling. All in all, I enjoyed the experience of reading this book, but I felt the character of Kate Vaiden did much more to wreck and hurt others than was done to her."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1064276-angela", "userReview": "I didn't really like this book much.

I proposed the book to my reading group as a possible choice among several other books each of which portrayed an individual American woman. The group chose a different book, but I went ahead and read \"Kate Vaiden\" (the last name rhymes with \"maiden\") anyway. The novel is unusual in that Price sets the novel in the first person in the voice of his primary female character. Novels in which the author writes in the voice of a person of the other gender are challenging and rare. Two recent examples of women writing in the voices of men are Siri Hustvedt's \"What I Loved\" and Marilynne Robinson's Pulitzer-prize winning \"Gilead\".Some reviewers have questioned whether Price (1933 -2011)has the understanding and novelistic skill to project himself effectively into the voice of a woman. Kate is her own person and an individual character indeed. As a young woman of 17, she abandons her baby son conceived out of wedlock. Price spends much of the novel trying to prepare the reader for this event. I thought he made Kate's behavior understandable and believable. As the story progressed, I became absorbed with Kate and her travails. I felt for her as she made her decisions, some good and many rash. The novel kept me involved with the heroine and her world.The novel is set in the rural upper South, in North Carolina and Virginia. Much of the book is set in Macon, North Carolina, where Price was born, with substantial portions set in Raleigh, Norfolk, Greensborough, and elsewhere. Most of the action of the book takes place during the Depression and WW II era, with these large events contrasted against the quiet voices of individual rural lives. The book proceeds through the post-Vietnam era into the 1980s, with glances at civil rights, feminism, the anti-war movement, and other great changes which occurred over a relatively short time span.The book is narrated by Kate Vaiden as a woman of 57. She tells the story of her life, especially of her tumultuous adolescence, with the hope that it will interest her son Dan, 40. Kate abandoned Dan when she was 17 and, at least up until the time she sets down her story, has had no contact with him. The book is almost a picaresque novel as young Kate picks up and moves many times and leaves a variety of people, relatives, lovers, and friends in her wake. The novel is sad as Kate abandons many people who genuinely want to offer her love, and Price made me sympathize both with Kate and with the others. Many of these individuals are themselves frequent lonely and searching. The novel is also a young woman's coming-of-age story. Abandonment, loss, and loneliness are important themes of the book as many of the characters, including Kate, her mother, the father of her baby, Douglas, her would-be lover Whitfield and others are orphans. Many people close to Kate die in the book: her parents, her first lover, and Douglas.There is a great emphasis on precocious sexuality in the book. Kate's parents, Dan and Frances, have an apparently passionate but doomed relationship. After their shocking death, Kate, raised by her mother's sister Caroline and her husband Holt, begins a sexual relationship with a slightly older boy named Gaston who dies during Marine boot camp. Kate blames herself. The book includes strong portrayals of this relationship which stays with Kate all her life. After Gaston's death, Kate is molested by her older cousin, Swift. She then begins a relationship with Douglas, an orphan who can be tender and loving but also who has a tendency towards drifting and violence. Kate cannot bring herself to marry Douglas, who also comes to a violent death. During the story Kate has many other sexual relationships with men and friendships with women but she allows them all to fall out of her life. Price emphasizes the importance of marriage and commitment, parts of life which are denied to Kate. Late in the novel, Kate has a conversation with a teacher, Rosalind Limer, who has unhappily remained unmarried through life. Kate explains to Miss Limer her rejection of some of her suitors. Miss Limer observes:\"I won't try to judge what I didn't get to watch. But steadiness is what men seldom have to offer -- not in life anywhow, not in this green world. We're not promised that, in the Bible or any other book known to me.\" (p.271)Kate achieves a modicum of financial security. She is an independent, tough, perceptive, yet vulnerable and highly fallible woman. I came to feel greatly for her through her mistakes and misfortunes. The book also offers a portrayal of small town life in the upper South in the years leading up to the Civil Rights Movement. Besides Kate, one of the characters that Price portrays effectively is Noony, an African American woman slightly older than Kate who works for Caroline and Holt. Noony offers her own commentary on Kate and on her life. The novel is presented against a backdrop of religious themes, including sin, redemption, and what appears to be God's ever-present love even in harsh circumstances. This is a stunning novel.Robin Friedman"}, {"userName": "Rebecca Macneal", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10008862-rebecca-macneal", "userReview": "Whether it's true or not, this is a real girl and a real story.

Read this book."}, {"userName": "Dennis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5531841-dennis", "userReview": "My initial impression of Reynolds Price\u2019s Kate Vaiden -- the first 50 pages or so, at least -- was the unique voice. I couldn't quite tell if the language was authentic Southern or Price's modified Southern. My best guess is that it's the latter because I spent three years in North Carolina and, to the best of my recollection, no one in North Carolina (well, Durham, NC, that is) talked like the way the characters did in Price's novel. And, as one of my professors once said, \"Okay, the voice is great, but you can't build a novel on voice alone. There has to be more.\" She's right, of course. After 50 pages, the distinctiveness of the voice, though a worthy accomplishment, wasn't enough. In fact, I got irritated by the voice at times. So, what else is there? I came away with Kate Vaiden with one dominant impression. And this impression was related to my experiences with literature as an adult. As a child, I read a variety of books from fairy tales to children\u2019s classics (e.g., Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, Winnie the Pooh) to young adult (e.g., The Pigman, Charlotte\u2019s Web) to crossover children/adult (e.g., The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, White Fang). As a fourth grader, I even read mass market adult literature (e.g., Jaws, Carrie, The Godfather) from cover to cover with little difficulty. But sometime in high school, I sort of lost interest in literature as I developed other interests. I simply couldn\u2019t finish a book \u2013 no matter how thin. (For those of you who know me and are wondering if I \u201cphoned in\u201d my reading assignments in school, the answer is \u201cno.\u201d I read everything that was assigned to me. My half-assed effort only applies to those books I selected on my own in my free time.) From high school until today, I often had difficulty finishing an entire novel. Since 1982, I\u2019ve attempted to read Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s Crime and Punishment on five separate occasions and I never made it past the first twenty pages. When I confessed to one of my professors, he remarked that perhaps my difficulties stemmed from my agony over Raskolnikov\u2019s dilemma. I said, \u201cWho\u2019s Raskolnikov?\u201d You see, what was happening was that I always believed there was something else I could be doing or some other (better) book I could be reading. So, I\u2019d invariably lose my concentration or my thoughts would otherwise stray to other more important \u2013 in my eyes \u2013 things. And this is what Kate Vaiden is about. Our heroine, Kate Vaiden (rhymes with \u201cmaiden\u201d), never commits to any one path in life. Just as she\u2019s developing a relationship or bond with someone or someplace, she bolts. Family, friends, lovers, beloved pets \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter who. There\u2019s a lot of hurt in her wake. She has a \u201cthe grass is always greener\u201d mentality \u2013 sort of like my experiences with literature. Four years ago, I started Salman Rushdie\u2019s Midnight\u2019s Children. I got to about page 80 and then I stopped reading. My thoughts then were: \u201cWell, this is a great book. I\u2019ll get back to it some other time.\u201d (I never did.) The same with Somerset Maugham\u2019s Of Human Bondage and Charles Dickens\u2019s David Copperfield. Kate Vaiden\u2019s inability to commit to a single concentrated path in her life was baffling \u2013 and frustrating. And as much as I tried to understand, I really couldn\u2019t divine any clear insight from the book. After each instance of Kate Vaiden\u2019s flights, I thought, \u201cKate, what the hell are you doing?!?\u201d I guess it\u2019s Reynolds Price\u2019s way of saying, hey, men aren\u2019t the only ones with commitment issues.Incidentally, I started reading Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Blind Assassin in 2009. After about 100 pages, I thought the book was great. For some inexplicable reason, I set it aside. It wasn\u2019t until 2012 that I finally finished it. But I\u2019m glad I did because it turned out to be one of my all-time favorites. Unlike me, I suppose Kate Vaiden herself never wised up. If she had actually made a commitment with one particular path, perhaps she would\u2019ve had a much better life. But some people \u2013 and I guess Reynolds Price is saying as much \u2013 are self-destructive and, for reasons unknown to them, are prone to significant errors in judgment."}, {"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1322946-betsy", "userReview": "I would have given it 3.5 stars but can't quite go up to 4.

Add to that that the book, centered on an adolescent to young 20s woman, is written by a man. The south is a whole different country. Homosexuality in the 1940s? Makes for a riveting read. All in all, quite an extraordinary accomplishment. i have to admit that i was hooked with the first couple lines: \"The best thing about my life up to here is, nobody believes it. I stopped trying to make people hear it long ago, and I'm nothing but a real middle-sized white woman that has dept on going with strong eyes and teeth for 57 years.\""}, {"userName": "Liz Dean", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/629833-liz-dean", "userReview": "Yes that's five stars for dear Ms. Vaiden. I'm still processing it, so maybe my opinion will go down, but basically, I loved it. Can I describe what I love about it yet? I'll try. I love how Kate's character is completely inscrutable. I just didn't understand why she made some of the choices she made. The ending didn't resolve it for me. I love how she accepts the consequences of her behaviors just as a matter of fact. I love the close, homey feel. This book is set in eastern North Carolina, where I grew up, Norfolk, VA, where I was born, and Raleigh, near where I live today. I love how a book about questionable choices ends with one last choice that Kate offers to her son."}, {"userName": "Namaste", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13142726-namaste", "userReview": "Usually I just do a star number rating and move on, but for this book I must take a moment and type. This novel is not for the faint at heart. If you're wholly entertained by your romantic side, don't bother with it. Kate Vaiden is a heartbreaking story of a woman who has a baby as a teenager and leaves him while he slept to be raised by her relatives. Kate herself was raised by an aunt following the violent death of her own parents as a girl. But this book is no sad-sack story. Reynolds Price, clearly a gifted story-teller, keeps you enthralled by his matter-of-fact lack of whine telling prose. Hope glimmers in the darkest corners of every Kate Vaiden's episodes. A very good read."}, {"userName": "Jsarno49", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1327095-jsarno49", "userReview": "Kate Vaiden is an unpredictable, hard-scrabble North Carolinian who relates her tale of growing up. In a very strong first person narrative, Kate relates her adventures from her early life as an orphan to her wanderings as a young woman through to her adulthood. Her constant search for belonging and home leads her on numerous side roads and fascinating relationships. Price is a gifted writer who certainly knows his character and depicts her strong character in her words as well as her actions. The use of foreshadow and direct address to the reader make this a very engaging read."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/440010-carmen", "userReview": "Beautiful Southern writing, except for the whole sexual-awakening-of-the young-girl thing, which read like the sexual awakening of a young girl as imagined by a gay man. I read this for a class in college, and one of the grad students wrote a whole paper about how it read like it was told through the eyes of a gay man -- so much that she thought the author meant us to imagine Kate as a man. The teacher seemed shocked, because she was a friend of Reynolds Price's, and he was in the closet at the time."}, {"userName": "GalwayGirl", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5871802-galwaygirl", "userReview": "Not loving this, sometimes not even liking it but going to finish as it's a book club read. Kate is becoming more and more unlikeable to me and I keep waiting for her to spark some sympathy or make me better understand her choices and behavior but 80 pages left and still no redemption in sight. I realize she had horrible experiences in her childhood but something is lacking in the writing to make me really feel that those tragedies made her turn out this way. She seems a very mixed up and selfish character and the rest of the cast aren\u2019t much better."}, {"userName": "Lorrie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/754524-lorrie", "userReview": "\"Fathers can walk out on whole nests of children every day of the year and never return, never send back a dime -- that's considered sad but natural.
