I really wish I lived next-door to Mrs. Oke. There's a peace about her writing, even when she deals with the hard stuff of life. There's a genuine delight in friends and family, the wonder of nature, the light of home, and the Power of God. Carrying on in the proud tradition of Catherine Marshall's Christy, Where Courage Calls tells the story of a young schoolteacher venturing into an unfamiliar world. As we saw both the poverty and beauty of Cutter Gap through Christy's eyes, we experience the spirit of Coal Valley through Beth Thatcher. She's a lovable girl from the start. Somehow, Beth wants more than the comfortable life that her family has bequeathed her and a teaching position in a mining town will let her spread her wings and do some good at the same time. There are a whole cast of men, women and children worth meeting in Coal Valley. Life itself is hard earned here, with no room for luxury. The wisdom and fortitude she encounters was forged through trials and grief: a terrible mining accident left most of the women widowed. There are great needs to be met in Coal Valley, and Beth is one young lady, yet she has high ideals, true faith to depend on, and a few unexpected friends to help her. The romance in this story was very refreshing... it is actually a story of friendship, between Beth and two young Canadian Mounties who are in and out of her district. Through the whole book, as I watched her relate to both of them based on mutual respect and goals, I couldn't guess which one would be more than a friend. That made the ending a sweet surprise. Thank you Mrs, Oke and Litfuse for my review copy!"}, {"userName": "Amanda Tero", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36174922-amanda-tero", "userReview": "There is nothing like a good Janette Oke book. Like I've mentioned before, hers is an older style of writing, so you either love it or not love it. I enjoyed the setting thoroughly and me being musical and a teacher, I appreciated those elements greatly.What I appreciated most was the strong spiritual thread. Wow. From pretty much page one, there was a decided spiritual thread. Beth and the other characters had a lot of things they went through, and through it all, they sought the Lord and tried to do what was right Biblically. It was one of those inspiring reads.There was the backdrop of romance in this book--I suppose the set-up for more to come in books two and three, but overall, it wasn't a strong romance thread."}, {"userName": "Iola", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164070-iola", "userReview": "My love for Christian fiction was inspired by Frank Peretti, Michael Phillips and Janette Oke. I think I\u2019ve read every book Janette Oke has ever published. She effectively created Christian prairie fiction with the Love Comes Softly series. She introduced me to Canada and inspired an enduring respect for the hardworking settlers and the Mounties with When Calls the Heart. When Courage Calls is co-authored by Janette and her daughter, Laurel Oke Logan, and it\u2019s just as good as the early books. It features Beth Thatcher, a young relative of Elizabeth (from When Calls the Heart), and Beth is following her aunt\u2019s footsteps by leaving the security of her well-to-do Toronto home to take a job teaching in the West\u2014Coal Valley, a mining town, in the 1920\u2019s. It\u2019s not a romance (although there are romantic elements). It\u2019s the story of a young woman from a privileged upbringing who finds herself serving in a small town with no conveniences (no shops\u2014not even indoor plumbing). As the story progresses, she is challenged by people and circumstances, and learns to rely on God for guidance in times of difficulty. It\u2019s reminiscent of the story of Elizabeth Thatcher, but it\u2019s also entirely Beth\u2019s own story. Recommended for all Janette Oke fans. If you\u2019ve read and enjoyed the When Calls the Heart books, you\u2019ll enjoy this. It is a standalone novel, as there are only passing references to the earlier books and locations, and this is set in a new time and place. So if you haven\u2019t read When Calls the Heart, you can still enjoy When Courage Calls.

It took me about 70 pages to really get into this book but, after that, I flew through it. The characters were really nice to read about, and I really liked all of them\u2013Frank Russo being my favorite. The character development was set at a realistic pace, and it was prominent. So many books that I have read show very little character development which is frustrating.

A love triangle is there, but it doesn\u2019t completely take over the storyline. This novel is more about Beth learning to follow God\u2019s leading and how to make wise decisions in difficult situations. Where Courage Calls, is a breath of fresh air, and I can\u2019t wait to continue on with the series.

Beth Thatcher has spent her entire life in the safe, comfortable world of her family, her friends, and the social outings her father's wealth provides. But Beth is about to leave it all behind to accept a teaching position in the rugged foothills of western Canada. Inspired by her aunt Elizabeth, who went west to teach school several years ago, and gently encouraged by her father, Beth resolves to put her trust in God and bravely face any challenge that comes her way. But the conditions in Coal Valley are even worse than she'd feared. A recent mining accident has left the town grieving and at the mercy of the mining company. The children have had very little prior education, and many of the locals don't even speak English. There isn't even a proper schoolhouse. In addition, Beth's heart is torn between two young men--both Mounties, one a lifelong friend and the other a kind, quiet man who comes to her aid more than once. Despite the many challenges, Beth is determined to make a difference in the rustic frontier town.

I read her entire Love Comes Softly series, Seasons of the Heart series, The Canadian West series, and a couple others of her stand-alone books. However, over the past few years I haven\u2019t read any of them. I had forgotten how much I had loved her books.This story was a refreshing change from the books I have been reading. Beth was neither shy or submissive to a fault, or so strong and boyish as to lose her femininity. Beth was sweet, but was also courageous. She wanted to teach despite her mother\u2019s protests, without hating her parents. She wanted to have a job, without thinking that homemaking was stupid. She wasn\u2019t a stereotype character.The story itself was a slower pace than many I have read lately. There isn\u2019t any heavy romance, or heart-stopping action. It is about the day-to-day struggle of Beth trying to teach in primitive situations, and help a mining town that has been devastated by a recent cave-in. There isn\u2019t much action, yet the story pulled at my heartstrings and kept me turning the pages.The cast of characters was rich and diverse. From the kind hearted, Italian miner, to the kind and wise woman who runs the boarding house, to the children in the class room; the characters were so real.I really enjoyed that the romance, although a part of the story, wasn\u2019t the main element of the book. As much as I love a good romance, it is nice to have some books that are not all about passion and romance.I highly recommend this book for readers who love Jennet Oke, light romance, and stories of courageous women.I received this book from Bethany House in exchange for my honest review.

Where Courage Calls, was co-written with her daughter Laurel Oke Logan, and is scheduled to be released in February 2014. It is described as a prairie romance, and is set in the Canadian west during the early twentieth century.The story\u2019s heroine, Beth Thatcher is a pampered daughter from a wealthy family from Toronto, and has accepted a year-long teaching position in a humble coal mining town far from the comforts of home. She believes she is following God\u2019s will for her life and is determined to prove to her overly protective mother that she is equal to the task, even after the conditions in the town prove more challenging and potentially dangerous than she had anticipated. Her luggage is stolen in her travels, and she arrives to find that modern conveniences like plumbing and electricity are unavailable. Nevertheless, she is determined to persevere.The story is inspiring in that Beth adapts to her circumstances, continually seeks God\u2019s will for her life, and ultimately makes a huge difference in the lives of her students and in the community. Christians looking for a safe and comfortable read, exploring the joys of leading a Godly life will find much to like in this sequel to When Calls the Heart.That said, I was not as impressed with this story as I had hoped I might be, given the author\u2019s reputation. I found the heroine hard to relate to. Her continual self-sacrifice and nobility made her come across more as a caricature or an ideal to be aspired to than as a real person. She is painted as selfless to the point where I\u2019m not sure I could identify anything she wants for herself, with the possible exception of being out from under her mother\u2019s thumb. Most of her desires seem to be for a better life for her students and to be able to better help her new friends and neighbors. Laudable, to be sure, but realistic? I\u2019m not so sure.The story started out slowly, with a lot of introspection and reflection on the heroine\u2019s childhood as she traveled to her new home. Her day to day life in the mining town, and the details of what her life and career there turned out to be were very well developed and interesting. However, for a book described as a romance, the romantic element seemed lacking. I thought that Beth\u2019s relationships with each of the potential suitors felt underdeveloped and her interactions with each of them limited, to the extent that I wasn\u2019t sure who the hero would turn out to be until the book was nearly over. Even then, the outcome felt contrived, because it did not hinge on her relationship with either suitor, but rather on an outside circumstance introduced at the last minute, seemingly to tidy things up.Overall, Where Courage Calls was a thoroughly sweet and innocent story and a pleasant enough read. Fans of historical fiction will appreciate the historical detail, and Christians seeking a clean and uplifting story about the good that can be accomplished by someone persevering in God\u2019s will, need look no further. This is your story. Additionally, fans of Janette Oke's Canadian West series or the Hallmark Channel's new When Calls the Heart TV series, will likely want to give this book a read. Just don\u2019t go into this story expecting a great deal of emphasis on the romance, or you may be disappointed.I would like to thank the publisher, Bethany House, for providing me with a free electronic copy of this book through NetGalley for my review.Discussion Questions are available on my blog at http://karencollier.com/book-review-w..."}, {"userName": "Bethany", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11040622-bethany", "userReview": "This new companion novel to the When Calls The Heart Hallmark movie and T.V. series, is sure to be a delightful read for any Janette Oke fans, as well as fans of the movie adaptions of her books. Filled with lots of prairie close-knit family together-ness and courage to boot, join Beth Thatcher on an unforgettable journey where she learns to trust God in every situation, knowing He is working all things out for good.This was a very nice novel, which I greatly enjoyed reading during the time when the T.V. series based on Janette Oke's book Where Calls The Heart, was airing each Saturday evening. I had already come to love the T.V. series and fallen in love with the characters, so I was very enthusiastic to read the book that inspired the series. Since this book is the companion novel to the series, it was neat getting to \"read\" more of the T.V. series, so to speak, and see what the movie episodes were based on. I've always been a fan of Janette Oke's Love Comes Softly series and movies, so I wasn't surprised to love this novel just as much as the Love Comes Softly saga!This book is full of Janette Oke's classic writing style that often features a hard working prairie family setting, a soft and clean romance as well as lots of strong Christian values and morals throughout. I was not surprised to end up enjoying this novel so much, and it reminded me in a way of her Love Comes Softly novels, though of course in a different setting. This novel focuses on main character Beth Thatcher's journey into the wild west to become a school teacher to the poor children of Coal Valley, who recently lost their fathers in a mining accident when the coal mine exploded, leaving shattered children and helpless widows. Accustomed to luxuries of indoor plumbing, electricity and plenty of money at her disposal, Beth is unaware that primitive Coal Valley and her new teaching position are both going to test her in more ways than one; and reveal who she really is underneath her family's wealth and fame to the person God has called her heart to be, and the life purpose He has for her. Among the many pros I found in this book, the biggest one was how big the emphasis on how your money doesn't define who you are as a person, and how everyone is important, was played out in the story. I loved Beth as she was a very humble character who willingly went to help poor people in a primitive town with few luxuries, when all she'd ever known was wealth and prosperity. I also loved her character. She was such a strong young lady and really aimed towards truly helping the people of Coal Valley and sharing Christ's love with others, no matter what their current situation was. I just loved being able to see how Beth connected with the people of Coal Valley despite their vast differences, and shared hope with them. At the end of the story I truly felt like she had truly reformed the town and left it better off than she found it; and I loved her example of how one person truly can make a difference for the Lord and bless others.While I did find the events that took place while Beth was in Coal Valley completely different than the events played out in the T.V. series, I found it uniquely interesting getting \"more\" of the events of this town while Beth was teacher. While some people may see this as a con since the book is so different than the movie, I didn't feel like it lessened the book, and actually thoughts it was interesting to continue the story with the same characters you already knew and loved from the T.V. episodes.Overall, I'd highly encourage all fans of Janette Oke's books and movie adaptions to read this book. It's filled with Christian values and a very sturdy life changing character, with an overall uplifting storyline, and sure to not disappoint!D I S C L A I M E R :: I received a free copy of Where Courage Calls from the publisher through Litfuse Publicity for the purpose of this review.

And it\u2019s not at all a surprise.Books are almost always better than movies \u2013 not to mention, the movie was actually the story Janette and her daughter have written here - when the storyline was supposed to be about Elizabeth and Wynn.In the movie, Elizabeth\u2019s niece \u2013 Beth was reading about her aunt\u2019s story as she embarked on an adventure of her own. I don\u2019t know if the movie was always meant to be a gateway into a series for Hallmark (if it was \u2013 I would have thought they\u2019d cast the people they intended to stay through the series\u2026) or not but that\u2019s how it turned out.I don't know if Janette Oke ever envisioned her stories being made into movies but I can not imagine that she truly had \"that\" picture in her head when she wrote the wonderful stories that Hollywood has twisted into their very own versions. Either way, this book is a masterful retelling of what was, in my humble opinion, a somewhat mediocre movie. Personally I don\u2019t care for some of the things that were added into the movie and I am thrilled to see that Janette and her daughter did not put them into this new novel. But that\u2019s not surprising either. Janette Oke is, and has always been, a superb writer. She writes each story so well, you feel as if you\u2019re right there with the characters.I can remember listening to my mother as she read the Love Comes Softly series to us as young children. Janette painted such a beautiful picture through her wonderfully vivid descriptions and the truly realistic plots. Each book was a treasure-trove of intrigue and adventure.I think Janette Oke was the first writer who inspired my own stories. She made it all sound like a wonderful fairy tale while also making it feel like you were listening to a story about one of your own ancestors \u2013 passed down through the generations.This story is no different. She hasn\u2019t lost a bit of her touch and I\u2019m thinking that it also bodes well that he daughter collaborated with her on this latest novel. The story is so much like her others, it feels less like a collaboration than a true meeting of the minds.BRAVO Janette and Laurel!I hope we see many more stories from the two of you!Disclaimer: I received this book free in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Sherri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20309937-sherri", "userReview": "One of my favorite books is When Calls the Heart. I've read numerous books by Janette Oke over the years, but that particular series is my favorite. So I was looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I think my expectations from were too high from the beginning. First, I saw the first (or maybe it was the second) in the series on Hallmark. I wasn't really pulled in or intrigued to watch another episode. But I blame that on me. I thought I was watching the series version of When Calls the Heart!So when I selected the book Where Courage Calls, I had one scene already in my head that was not in the book. I don't see how the two can be considered companion pieces, when scenes in the book are drastically different from the book. In the tv series, there is a stagecoach robbery. In the book, there is no mention of such, rather a theft of a different nature.But putting all that aside, my overall reaction to the book is disappointment. I thought it moved along very slowly, parts of it delightful, but other parts I kept waiting for something to happen. It's almost as though the writers were told, let's make this one book into a second part, now drag it along.The characters I didn't really get to know, other than the main character. Her \"love\" interests, I never got to know, I had no sort of affinity for them. The drama of the book didn't captivate me, because it almost seemed trite. And the event at the end, again, I didn't feel any sort of clues or dramatic event to lead up to it. The most disappointment was the ending of the story. It leaves too much of it open ended.Overall, it's an okay book. Written well, but lacking in areas. It was a book I could set down and have no urgent interest in finishing it, but I did finish it.I received this book from Bethany House Publishers for my honest review.

Only God gets ta say. If He says ya should, then ya mind Him. If folks say ya should\u2014ya jest go back an' ask God. Don't need more'n that to measure up to.'

It is over the top cheesy goodness to which I am addicted through 2 seasons. The title comes from a Janette Oke series of the same name, but the characters are based on this book series - a follow up series of which this is book 1. This is one case where I like the show much better than the book. I enjoy the story a lot. A young, wealthy schoolteacher goes into the Canadian wild west to teach in a small mining town. Think adult Little House on the Prairie in Canada. The show follows some of this book's plot through season 1, but don't expect all the characters or plot points. In one big difference, I liked the book's portrayal of Jack Thornton better than the show. He is older (30), more established as a Mountie, and more direct in his courtship of Elizabeth. Oke's writing style is hard for me to take. It is a removed first person with almost no humor, a lot of naivete, and some self-righteousness. It's distinctive. As much as I've liked some of her books, i.e. the Love Comes Softly series, the style grates on me."}, {"userName": "Alyssa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1586516-alyssa", "userReview": "Real Rating: 4.5 starsWhere Courage Calls is the newest release from Janette Oke and her daughter Laurel.

This has, in no way, altered my opinion of the book and what is written below is a 100% honest review.When I found out that this novel contained many of the same characters that were in Hallmark Channel\u2019s When Calls the Heart series I knew that I HAD to read this novel. I\u2019m a total HC nerd and I\u2019ve been obsessed with that TV show from the very beginning. That being said, I believe that my expectation that this novel would be like the TV show and the actual reality that this novel was not at all like the show may have affected my feelings about this book. Nothing was the same except for character and town names. But, this is only a When Calls the Heart novel and not the actual novel\u2026 if I\u2019m reading this right.This novel tells the story of prim and proper Elizabeth (Beth) Thatcher who travels out to a remote mining community, leaving behind all of her usual luxuries and amenities, to teach a group of children. Her faith is tested and tried as she encounters friends and foes and discovers more about herself and about the impoverished town of Coal Valley.MORAL RATING:G: Really though. Nothing happens. At all. Which I like.THE GOOD:Janette Oke and Laurel Oke Logan are good writers and I never sensed any awkward phrasing.THE BAD: This book just really didn\u2019t grab my attention. Towards the end, I just started skipping parts. First of all, the cover indicates that it is a Christian romance, but there was no romance until 80% into the book. And, even then, the romance was so abrupt and weird that it wasn\u2019t enjoyable. Suddenly, she has some guy interested in her, but there is absolutely no build-up to their relationship; it comes out of nowhere. It wasn\u2019t well planned at all. Also, I tend to like Christian novels that are not overly preachy and do not contain the message that once you accept Christ, everything is suddenly peachy. Sure, there were conflicts in this novel, but they were all solved through prayer and neighborly goodness. It wasn\u2019t believable. I\u2019m a Jesus person and this novel was just too cheesy. I do take into consideration that this is a Christian fiction novel (there are going to be cheesy elements obviously) and I\u2019ve read many novels in this genre, but this one was not remarkable to me. I don\u2019t mean to harass this book to death, but it just annoyed me. I know that Janette Oke is a respected Christian fiction author, so I assume that her other novels are better than this one! Plus, the character of Beth is so selfless and Godly and she was almost too unrealistic. She was not relatable at all!I\u2019d give this 2/5!"}, {"userName": "Sydney Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4519458-sydney-elaine", "userReview": "4.5 starsUnlike other times where I usually have something to say before moving onto the review, this time I can't think of anything to say so I'm going to jump right in and get started.First off, if you are looking for a book that follows the movie or TV show storyline, this book is not for you. At least, that is what I've seen on other reviews. I know this review isn't about the movie/TV show but because this book is supposed to be a companion to the Hallmark series, When Calls the Heart, I felt it was important for the TV watchers to know that the book series does not follow the TV show. Which in a way, I suppose is not a bad thing because then you are able to have two different storylines and can choose to your liking.Historically, there was not a whole lot of background that I can remember. Which was totally fine. Based on the cover, you can guess that it's around the early 1900's, and the book describes as much. There are no inaccuracies as far as I could tell in my little knowledge of that time period, but the same can't be said of the TV show. It's little things, but the little things bother me the most. I won't get into it because it doesn't claim to be a historical show (you can go watch Downton Abbey for that), but it still bothers me because so much of the show is already based in the early 1900's, but no matter. It's just my detail oriented brain being nit-picky as always.I really enjoyed reading about Beth... She is different than other heroines in novels I've read, and I can relate to her fears and her wanting to become more independent and wish for more out of life, and she actually reminds me a bit of Belle from Beauty and the Beast. The book basically just takes us through her adjusting from her high-life to a more simple way of living. The characters are very well rounded and realistic, even the minor characters.I would describe the plot line as \"soft\". There's not page turning action or anything like that. It basically just describes Beth's adjustment to living on the prairie. And that is pretty much it!"}, {"userName": "Kate (The Shelf Life)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3616293-kate-the-shelf-life", "userReview": "Janette Oke's books hold a special place in my heart. Her books introduced me to Christian historical fiction. I have read all of her previous books and I still look forward to her new books. So, it was safe to say I was thrilled when I saw Janette Oke and her daughter Laurel Oke Logan were releasing a new novel, Where Courage Calls, part of When Calls the Heart.It was enjoyable to dive back into the When Calls the Heart stories. Instead of continuing with the original characters, we are introduced to newer characters. We did see Beth briefly in the original series, but as a little girl. Here, Beth has grown and made it through college and is ready to put her knowledge to use, just like her aunt, in the wilds of the Canadian frontier.It was a delight experiencing the quiet, but busy life Beth had as a teacher in a small coal mining town. Beth faces many challenges, but she does her best to push through with her intelligence and with her faith. She is also quick to make friends and as she becomes accustomed to the town, this small town starts to become her home.There is a small romance that buds in these pages, but it isn't the main focus of the story. I saw this story as Beth finding out who she is and who God wants her to be. She has been led by her mother to be certain ways, but here in Coal Valley away from her mother's nudging, Beth is able to discover what her own strengths are. I liked how Beth was finding out who she was before pursuing a relationship. That shows a wonderful strength in her.The story was left open to possibly continue, I hope it does, I would like to see where Beth's story takes her.Thank you to Litfuse Publicity and Bethany House, I received a copy of this book for free in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Maureen Timerman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3840941-maureen-timerman", "userReview": "When I saw that one of my all time favorite author had a new book out, co-authored by her Daughter Laurel Oke Logan, I knew I had to read it. Again, I was not disappointed.In this book we have Elizabeth's niece Beth. Beth comes from a well to do family, and has always had a delicate health. When she decides to take a teaching job out West in Coal Town. Her Mother doesn't want her to go, but her father prevails and Beth is off on a new adventure in her life.Long time family friend Edward, meets her as she gets off the train, he has been there on the train with her all along. He precedes to help Beth getting to her hotel, and hires a man to take her things there. I find this quite a funny part of the story, as Edward is in his Royal Mounted Police uniform, and pays the guy....who steals everything. What a start to a new life?? Arriving in a new town as the teacher, with no clothes or books, or anything...no underwear! Now this is a small, small town, you cannot go out and buy what you need. Thank goodness Mom comes to the rescue.Through out all of her stay here, she finds a new family. The people make her feel so welcome, and Beth keeps coming up with new ways to help these miners and their families. I can see God's hand in a lot of what happens here. He seems to answer a lot of prayers. We will sympathize with the plight of the families here, and hope something can be done for them. Beth sure is trying!You will wonder if there is a bit of romance in the air, and I see at least three possibilities. Will any of them work out?I hope that there will be more stories coming, I feel like I need to know what is going to happen next!

Will her faith pull her through even when she has two very different men vying for her heart?Where Courage Calls is a well written story, with classic values and an admirable heroine. Everything one could hope for from an Oke novel. I loved the timeless quality to the story, and writing which to me just confirms why Janette Oke has long been a household name in Christian Fiction and Romance. One of my favorite things about this book was Beth's growing faith, and trust in God through the tough times, when it would have been easy to take things into her own hands. This is an engaging tale from start to finish, and if you think that you don't need to read this book because you saw the movie, think again! The movie leaves off at what is only about 15% of the way through the book, so if you want to find out what happens...Overall this was a terrific read, with a godly love story that I hope will continue in future books. I liked how the ending was both open and satisfying, so that even if there aren't any more new books for a while I won't die, but left me wanting more just the same! Reading this book brought me back to my younger years when all I read were Janette Oke books, with its classic coming of age tale mixed with sweet romance.

I only picked up this book because I just binge watched the hallmark channel series \"when calls the heart\" on Netflix and saw that it's supposedly based on this book. That being said, this is one case where the show was SO much better than the book. I found the book annoyingly preachy (and I consider myself a religious person) and there were very few similarities between the book and the show. Basically a few characters names are the same and the setting takes place in coal valley. Other than that, the two entities had pretty much nothing in common. Also, the \"relationships\" between Beth and the two men are so ludicrously undeveloped/nonexistent, that I found it insane at the end (and I do mean the VERY end) of the book that jack is asking for permission to court her. All in all I was kind of annoyed at the very end that I had wasted my time reading the book. And that is that! Although it looks like I'm in the minority with my review here...{on an unrelated note -- I finally have a library card again after almost 2 years of having lived here! People who know me well will find it hard to believe, but I have not read very much at all in the last couple of years. Maybe I'll go back and recap something for the few books I've read, but I think it will be easier to just move forward.}"}, {"userName": "Jennifer Smith", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26792793-jennifer-smith", "userReview": "True to Janette-Oke form, an enjoyable read with great writing.This was a heartwarming story about personal growth with a smidgen of romance tossed in the mix. The main character, Beth, was a little too melancholy and anxious for me, but she had a lot of heart. I enjoyed watching the small town of Coal Valley revive under her influence. There were also elements of mystery that kept me wondering until the end.To me, the biggest mystery of all was who Beth was going to end up falling in love with--or if she was going to fall in love at all. I honestly had no idea until the answer was revealed at the end! Because it's usually known who the heroine will end up with from early on, I liked this unique aspect of this novel.It did take a while for me to really get into this book. It began with Beth preparing to leave her family. She seemed unhappy to go--as if she was dreading the whole ordeal. I was left wondering why she had made the decision to leave at all.

It felt like revisiting that beloved series - in fact I couldn't resist re-reading the original four books after reading this one. The originals are better in my opinion (but maybe that's my nostalgia talking too) but I did really like how Beth and Edward both matured in this story and overcame their prejudices against each other. In fact, honestly, I was rooting more for spoiled, bossy Edward as the love interest in this story than Jarrick, who was too much like the near perfect Wynn; I wanted someone less perfect, someone with some issues of his own to overcome. The scene between Edward and Beth at breakfast on the train west was my favorite in the book. (The rest of the book was almost a let down after this). Beth is convicted that she treated Edward rudely the night before, and she's determined to be more Spirit-led this morning but oh my goodness Edward makes it hard on her! He insults her first by calling her notion of heading west to teach ridiculous, and then he goes off on a rage about how women like to pretend that they can take care of themselves and make a great show of their independence but it only lasts a year before they're engaged and letting a man provide for them. Amazingly, Beth takes this scorn without blowing up. Beth watch her hands slowly smooth the napkin across her lap as she edited her thoughts.... she waited in hardwon silence while each angry, quarrelsome response paraded through her mind. She considered commenting on the fact that he would inherit much of what he needed to support himself, that men benefit as much by marriage as women, that married women are not women of leisure but hardworking helpmates to their husbands, or that choosing a career did not even imply she was not interested in becoming a wife also. [RAH! RAH!!!] Instead, she dismissed each of these as argumentative and renewed her determination not to allow him to ruffle her feathers with declarations she doubted even he actually believed... She paused a moment longer and took a slow sip of tea [it's always good to have a cup of tea on hand during confrontational moments]. \"I'm sorry you feel this way, Edward. I can see you don't understand my decision, but it is one I have reached under the counsel and protection of my parents. I'm afraid it does not require your approval.\" Beth, you just became my hero. I hope to train my girls to be wise and gentle like this in the face of scorn...Though this was my favorite part of the story, I don't want to dismiss the rest of the story, the encouragement of seeing Beth love and serve the miners' widows and children of Coal Valley and even reach out to the new Italian miners who don't even speak English. I only watched two episodes of the TV series based on this story (confusingly named after When Calls the Heart (???!!!); it just doesn't compare to the book, though the TV Jack at least was more interesting and contentious, like Edward, than too perfect Jarrick)."}, {"userName": "Laurie Carlson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4898049-laurie-carlson", "userReview": "I first saw this book made into a movie/TV mini-series called \"When Calls the Heart\" on The Hallmark Channel. They have done a remarkable job making so many movies out of so many of Janette Oke's books! I could sit all day, and I have sat all day watching the movies based on her books! Most all of these movies, from what I can tell, are available to watch as movies/mini-series wherever you purchase them from. You can also catch them on TV as re-runs, too, or even as dedicated days or weekends called 'for fans of Janette Oke'. I have fallen in love with the books and the movies and mini-series. If I see them coming, I take the time to rewatch them! They are so true-to-life and apply to even today, in my opinion. This book I am reviewing here is different than the movie version/TV series, and if you are interested in reading that book, there is a dedicated book that is has the same name as the movie version/mini-series called 'When Calls the Heart: Hallmark Channel Special Movie Edition (Canadian West Book 1)'. I have also LOVED Janette Oke for decades now! I used to go to the library and get her books out on cassette tape and listen to them when I had a job that had an over one-hour commute to and then home from work each way, and that time just flew by as I listened to them! I looked forward to my commute just so I could listen to the books (and read them at home) because it transformed that commute I had into a wonderful trip to so many places the characters went on their way out towards and into the prairies and the west as new settlers finding their places to call home. I was also a newlywed myself at the time, so perhaps that even struck closer to home as we were looking for a place to call home, too. These wonderful memories and seeing the show on TV got me wanting to read this series of books.I have to say I was a little worried about how much longer Janette Oke would be writing for, especially given the number of books she has written! Her first book was published in 1979, so I was worried she might be getting tired of her long but wonderful writing career as she has written now for so long. It is truly amazing that her daughter, Laurel Oke Logan, her daughter, has now joined her and they are writing together as a team now! This makes me SO HAPPY that the Oke name will be carried on writing for many more (perhaps) decades to come, or at least I hope! I also LOVE the fact that there will be many more movies made out of her books, too! Thanks, Hallmark Channel! With that being said, it states this book is a companion story to that channel's TV series, \"When Calls the Heart\". Keep this in mind when reading this book because it is different than the TV movie/mini-series. It does has very subtle differences, and some definite changes at that, so it's very worthwhile to read the book. I got a lot out of reading this book. It did lack in the romance department, though as compared to the movie/mini-series, so don't have your heart set on what you saw in the television series for this particular book as this one is not at all like the movie/mini-series. I was bummed at first, but then I realized I do get to visit there yet again! This time the same place! This is where the book goes by the name I gave above.In this similar book, we are transported back to the very late 1800's, very early 1900's, and I say that because there were mention of automobiles, one in particular taking her from the train into Coal Valley to the supposed hotel. Meet Elizabeth (Beth) Thatcher, named after her Aunt Elizabeth who journeyed from the east coast in Boston, out West to teach. She had just traveled all the way from the east coast/Boston to the west In Coal Valley, Canada, a little mining town had just suffered a horrible loss. Many of the women are now widows due to this accident they are still trying to recover from, including the children as they lost their fathers. The mothers felt the first male teacher that was provided by the mining company was not adequate at all. He seemed to have a temper and just did not care to teach in the manner they needed him to. Since their children did not have adequate schooling, these mother's hired a teacher on their own by pooling money together and hiring a professional teacher to come teach their children. Beth learned of the open position and wanted to follow in her aunt's footsteps, so against her mother's best wishes about Beth's constitution, as she suffered many illnesses as a child and as a young adult, she set off with her father's blessings more so than her mothers. When Beth was young, she battled illness after illness and was much more fragile than most of the other kids, and did battle some illness while in Coal Valley, but it didn't help that she bit off a little more than she could handle. Beth had a student leave for a while to go work in the mines. She swore she did not want this for the rest of the children she taught. She prayed to God to find out what she could do to bring more to this community, and this is a quote from the GALLEY (not the printed version as this could be different:\"God had brought her to Coal Valley, but unless something more was done - something for the town and the miners - those growing up now would face the same troubles as of their parents. In Beth's mind, the biggest need for the entire area and the one thing that would bring them together was a shared faith. But what could she do? She was just one person - and a woman. She felt hopeless.\"The more she prayed, an answer came. Bring the miners and the townspeople together. So she tried.Beth relied on God throughout the book to get her and the people of the town through all types of different things. It seemed to work.On her train ride home for the summer going back home for just a few months, she did receive a surprise from one of the two mounties, but I'll let you read the book to find out which one that was! There were two vying for her attention. Edward, a friend of the family whom she wasn't really so fond of, and then there was Jerrick! She had a few instances where she spoke with him, and a few where they had to pull together to find one of the children who had gone missing. That's all I'll say about that!If you really enjoyed this book, When Courage Calls - When Calls the Heart Book One, there is an entire Canadian West series based on Elizabeth Thatcher's Aunt that she talks a lot about which you may really enjoy! This would be Book One, and there are more!When Calls the Heart - Canadian West Book OneWhen Comes the Spring - Canadian West Book TwoWhen Breaks the Dawn - Canadian West Book ThreeWhen Hope Springs New - Canadian West Book FourBeyond the Gathering Storm - Canadian West Book FiveWhen Tomorrow Comes - Canadian West Book SixAfter this series, there is another series called The Women of the West!Enjoy your reading!I received this book for FREE from the Publisher, Bethany House, and NetGalley, in exchange to read and write a review about it. \"Free\" means I was provided with ZERO MONIES to do so, but to enjoy the pure pleasure of reading it and giving my own honest opinion no matter whether it is positive or negative.
