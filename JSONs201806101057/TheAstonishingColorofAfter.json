Why was it so hard to talk about this? Why did my mother\u2019s condition feel like this big secret?...\u201cShe\u2019s forgotten how to be happy,\u201d I told him.\nAs you can see from the picture I shared on instagram, this book was so quotable. There were so many beautiful thoughts, emotions and moments captured perfectly with words.I probably wouldn't have read The Astonishing Color of After if I hadn't noticed it on my library's new releases page and thought \"why not?\" Talk of magical realism and a mother who turns into a bird made it sound a little too weird for my tastes; plus, talk of \"lush writing\" and comparisons to writers like Nova Ren Suma made me think it might be an obnoxiously flowery magical realism book.Honestly, all that is a little misleading. Leigh's first-person narrative - though prone to a kind of synesthesia - is far more frank and lacking in bullshit than I'd expected. She comes across as realistic, flawed and complex. The story itself is an interesting journey that does more than the typical YA grief novel. In the wake of her mother's suicide, Leigh is convinced her mother has turned into a bird and is trying to communicate with her. This leads her down a path that forces her to come to terms with the mental illness that her mother had lived with for years. \nHer words come out in shattered pieces, unintelligible, thick with hopelessness, heavy under the weight of something that\u2019s taken me years to even begin to understand.Nothing is right, she says.\nIn a refreshing change from the YA contemporaries I usually read, most of this story takes place in Taiwan. After her mother's death, Leigh travels there to reconnect with the Taiwanese part of her family and the author does not miss the opportunity to make the most of her setting. We are taken on a richly-portrayed journey, as Leigh discovers her mother's roots, language and culture.The new discoveries in Taiwan alternate with flashbacks to Leigh's life with her mentally ill mother. Many studies have been done on the stigma around mental illness in Asian culture. The NLAAS found that Asian-Americans are three times less likely than white Americans to seek mental health help. Which is why this book about a Taiwanese woman with depression is so important. Through Leigh, depression is unpacked and explored. She longs to find out why her mother was sad enough to kill herself - was it a person? a particular event? - but, of course, there is no why. Depression is the reason in itself, and expecting it to make sense is asking too much of its sufferers.It's just a beautifully-written (but not over-written) and deeply moving book. The only thing I didn't love was the romance with Axel. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it, exactly, and it avoids the usual YA tropes, but it felt unnecessary. Why do we need a romance in here? We have a heartbreaking story of loss, grief, depression, family and identity, all in a beautifully-imagined Taiwanese setting. We just didn\u2019t need a romance, too. But this is a small complaint for an otherwise really impressive debut.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Hailey (HaileyinBookland)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21937982-hailey-haileyinbookland", "userReview": "TW: suicide, depressionSuch a beautiful debut! The writing was exquisite, I really cared for the characters, and I loved learning more about Chinese/Taiwanese culture! It was a fully immersive read that was definitely heartbreaking, but beautiful overall. The magical realism/religion element was excellently executed. Really enjoyed this one! My only complaint is it was a teensy bit too long IMO (though it did really insanely fast for the most part)."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie", "userReview": "\u201cIf he looked in my eyes straight on, he would know how he\u2019d pierced me with an arrow, how its shaft was still sticking out of my chest, twitching each time my heart contracted. And maybe he\u2019d see how my mother had sliced up everything else.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the most beautiful books I\u2019ve ever read in my entire life. It\u2019s powerful, moving, poignant, lyrical, important, and touched me beyond words. From the discussion about mental health and the stigmas we still have in 2018 (especially in Asian cultures), to the true portrayal of grief, to the heartbreaking truth about depression, to the realistic depiction of what it means to be not only biracial but to be white passing, to the discovery of your identity. The Astonishing Color of After is a book I will cherish for the rest of my life. \n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve carved out my heart and brain and given them to her just so she could feel right again.\u201d\n\nBut this is a very heavy book, so big trigger and content warnings for suicide, depression, loss of a loved one, depiction of blood, very intense suicidal thoughts, abandonment, racial slurs/remarks, and mention of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). But if you\u2019re in the right state of mind, I recommend this book with my whole heart and soul. This will easily make my best of 2018 list. The Astonishing Color of After is a story about a girl who has just realized that her mother has committed suicide. This book follows her suffering with the loss of her mother, who she is also seeing in the shape of a bird. This bird has convinced our main character, Leigh, to travel to Taiwan, because there is something there that her mother wants her to remember. \n\n\u201cMy mother is a bird. This isn\u2019t like some William Faulkner stream-of-consciousness metaphorical crap. My mother. Is literally. A bird.\u201d\n\n\u27bd \n Mental Health\n -This is a book about mental health and how depression impacts everyone around the person who is living with it. In the acknowledgements, Emily X.R. Pan states that she was inspired to finish this book after someone close to her took their own life. And I\u2019m not going to say that her experience, or my experience, are the only experiences, but the depiction of depression in this book sends a chill up my spine because it feels so real and accurate. This book discusses how people always think they could have saved the person who ended their life. Or how pills and medications are the fix that depressed people need. Sometimes people believe in other, terrible, treatments that will cure depression, no matter what it costs that person. Depression is an illness, just like anything else. It can come once, it can come and go, and it can come and never leave. But depression is real, and it can be hard, really hard, and it\u2019s not something that\u2019s an \u201ceasy fix\u201d, and it\u2019s not something that we should keep stigmatizing and pretending that it\u2019s not a real illness. And this book respectfully and beautiful depicts that. And there is absolutely no suicide shaming in this book.\n\n\u201cLong before doctors put a label on her condition and offered slips of paper bearing the multisyllabic names of pharmaceuticals. Long before my father started leaving on his work trips. Long before everything: She was already hurting.\u201d\n\n\u27bd \n Grief\n -The start of this book was really heavy and hard to read for me. When Leigh discovers what her mother did my heart felt like it was being shredded. But seeing her mother live with her own grief shredded my soul. Depression, loss, and grief are highlighted themes through this entire book, and they are so real and so important and I have no words to express how much they meant to me that they were huge components of this YA story. \n\n\u201cIn the beginning, that mother-shaped hole was made of blood. Dark and sticky, soaked to the roots of the carpet.\u201d\n\n\u27bd \n Discovery\n -Ultimately, this is a book about Leigh discovering her self in every sense of the word. From discovering her sexuality, to discovering her creativity, to trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life. To also living with a parent that is depressed, to sharing a life with a parent who is never home. To finally discovering her culture that has been somewhat hidden from her for her entire life. Also, this book is the biggest love letter to the healing power of art.\n\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s where all the other colors are hiding\u2014in a dimension of the world we just can\u2019t see, between our sky and the rest of the universe.\u201d\n\n\u27bd \n Being Biracial\n -I feel like this is something I never talk about because I feel shame because of all the privileges I\u2019ve received my entire life from being so very white passing, but apparently 2018 is the year I bring up my Filipino heritage in every review I write. I\u2019m a lot more white passing than Leigh, but the things she deals with and feels, especially when she travels to Taiwan, is something so real and something I\u2019ve never had depicted in a book before. From my light hair and eyes, to my barely basic understanding of Tagalog, this book was the book I\u2019ve been searching for my entire life. I have no word combination for how seen I felt in the book. (Also the love interest is half Filipino, and was the cutest little cinnamon role who warmed my heart throughout the book!) \n\n\u201cI suck in a deep breath and quicken my steps to press closer to my grandmother. Her proximity feels like a shield. If only I didn\u2019t stand out so obviously with my lighter eyes, with my lighter hair and its streak of green. If only I had been raised more Taiwanese, and could somehow prove to these people that I belong here.\u201d\n\n\u27bd \n Identity\n -But seeing Leigh claim back her identity is something so beautiful that I don\u2019t even have words for. This story is crafted and woven so exceptionally between different pasts and her present, and seeing Leigh come into her own is something I can\u2019t possibly put into words. \n\n\u201cWe try so hard to make these little time capsules. Memories strung up just so, like holiday lights, casting the perfect glow in the perfect tones. But that picking and choosing what to look at, what to put on display\u2014that\u2019s not the true nature of remembering.\u201d\n\nOverall, I loved this (if you couldn\u2019t tell)! This, again, is a story that I will carry inside of my heart for the rest of my life. Emily X.R. Pan has crafted something that is so raw, but so magical. Plus, this is one of the most impressive debuts that I\u2019ve ever read in my entire life. I recommend this with my entire heart and soul. Oh, and real quick I want to mention that Leigh has a lesbian best friend who has the most supportive mom (and family) in the world and it was such a bright shining light for me! Also, the mom\u2019s name is Mel and I\u2019m going to totally believe her name is Melanie and it was a glimpse of my future if I ever have kids. Okay, now, go buy this book and come gush with me!

This is one of those books. The writing is so evocative that you will feel the intensity of everything the main character goes through to the marrow of your bones and be able to picture it all in your mind like a movie. Normally, a story this long and slow would take me around a week to finish. Unlike the majority of you think, I don\u2019t read fast. At all. I just read\u2026 a lot. But even if this novel lacks actual action, its words are a kind of beautiful that makes you overlook weaknesses. And besides, it is character-driven and there\u2019s nothing wrong about that.It\u2019s also a magical realism story, but one that is in no way going to confuse you to the point where you\u2019ll be tempted to give up on trying to understand the elements pertaining to the fantasy genre. Feng\u2019s character is a bit funky, but other than that, I absolutely adored all characters and magical elements included here, especially the bird, of course. The author does a fantastic job of three-dimensionalizing Leigh and her deceased mother, Dory. More often than not, I feel little connection to fictional people that passed away before I had gotten a chance to know them, but because we learn about Dory\u2019s past gradually, the author going back to the root of the family drama, I couldn\u2019t help but sympathize and understand what she went through. Not only that, but the author never romanticizes depression or mental illness in general. There are, as mentioned, unrealistic elements, but these are tied to Leigh\u2019s reaction to her mother\u2019s death and the latter\u2019s wish for her daughter to be exposed to her family history, something she was denied in the past. Waves of happiness are running through me as I\u2019m pondering the fact that this is a debut. This means that, logically speaking, more books from this author are to come!

Memories strung up just so, like holiday lights, casting the perfect glow in the perfect tones. But that picking and choosing what to look at, what to put on display\u2014that's not the true nature of remembering. Memory is a mean thing, slicing at you from the harshest angles, dipping your consciousness into the wrong colors again and again.\"Leigh Sanders has always caught people's attention\u2014for the colorful streaks she puts in her hair, her artistic talent, and her mixed heritage, as her mother is Chinese and her father is Irish-American. But no matter how many times she asked through her childhood, she's never met her maternal grandparents, never heard much about her mother's life before she met Leigh's father while studying in America. It's always a door that has remained closed, and if anything, Leigh's attempts to open it have been met with real resistance from her parents.Then one day, the bottom falls out. Leigh's mother commits suicide. Although her depression always seemed a part of their lives the last several years, neither Leigh nor her father ever really thought this would happen. Leigh tries to figure out what signs she might have missed, what she could have done differently, while at the same time, she blames her father's withdrawal from their lives, his continual business travels, for leaving her mother so vulnerable.In the days following her suicide, Leigh believes her mother keeps returning to her in the form of a beautiful red bird, but when she calls out to her, or asks her to stay, the bird flies away. What is her mother trying to tell her? What does she want Leigh to do?\"Once upon a time we were the standard colors of a rainbow, cheery and certain of ourselves. At some point, we all began to stumble into the in-betweens, the murky colors made dark and complicated by resentment and quiet anger.\"As if all of that isn't complicated enough, Leigh must also face facts that on the day her mother killed herself, Leigh finally kissed Axel, her best friend and (perhaps not-so) secret crush. How can she reconcile those two events?Her father finally relents and travels with Leigh to Taiwan so she can finally meet her maternal grandparents. There she hopes that she'll finally understand what her mother is trying to tell her, what she wants her to remember. As she begins to learn more about her mother and the reasons she closed herself and Leigh off from her heritage, she learns powerful lessons about the power of memory, loss, ghosts, and the connections of blood and friendship.This is a beautiful, heartfelt, somewhat quirky book, which shifts between real and fantasy, present and past. At times it's necessary to suspend your disbelief, as Leigh is able to witness memories she never knew about (or, in some cases, wasn't alive for), and there's a lot of discussion about ghosts, as they're revered and feared in Taiwan. Additionally, being an artist, Leigh tends to reflect and explain moods in color, particularly unusual shades of color, so that may strike some as off-putting.Those quirks aside, \nThe Astonishing Color of After\n really is astonishing. Emily X.R. Pan captures teenage angst, grief, and fears perfectly, and the strange unevenness of family dynamics. This is a book that dazzled, lyrically and emotionally, as it made me tear up, which is always a fun thing to do on a plane ride! This may not be a book for everyone, but for those who decide to read it, I hope it paints a beautifully emotional portrait for you as well.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html."}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "I'm proud of my Asian heritage. That said, there are some things upon which the Asian culture can improve in general, and one of the major issues is how we treat mental illness. It is a stigma. It is ignored until one explodes. Even in the US, Asian-American women have a high rates of suicide because of how unwilling we are to talk about our problem, and the unwillingness of our family to confront it.There have been numerous suicides among famous actors and musicians in countries like Japan and South Korea, and after each one, people talk about it and how sad it is, and how we should not overlook depression, but I feel like nothing is ever done after the mourning period. People are still afraid to talk about their feelings for the fear of sounding weak. I think in the US, depression is not such a stigma here, and we are encouraged to seek help. In East Asian countries, mental health was and remains to be overlooked.I suffered from depression myself, I shouldn't use the past tense because sometimes I find myself in its grip, because depression never really goes away. As someone caught between my heritage and American culture, this book hits very close to home.Leigh is the main character in this book, a Taiwanese-American, half white, half Asian. Her mother commits suicide, and Leigh believes that she turned into a bird.\nMy mother is a bird. This isn\u2019t like some William Faulkner stream-of-consciousness metaphorical crap. My mother. Is literally. A bird.\nSomeone mentioned \"magical realism\" in their review of this book and I almost ran screaming away. I fucking hate the bullshit woo-woo of magical realism. It was a poor way to describe this book, because while it has a magical, mystical quality, the tone of the narrator makes it completely readable.Leigh is just a typical teenager. I shouldn't say \"typical\" because so commonly in YA books, a typical teenager acts so clich\u00e9d. A better word is \"believable.\" She has feelings that I could relate to. She feels guilt. She feels desire.\nDuring sex ed, our teachers always made it sound like the guys were the horny ones. But right there on that couch I was certain that some crucial detail about the female body, or at least my body, had been left out.\nThis book is about Leigh's journey to understanding her mother, someone she only thought she knew. It's also a journey for Leigh, who discovers herself. It's an excellent rite-of-passage book.I love the way the book incorporates her feelings for her friend and crush, Axel. It's not an overwhelming thing, but Leigh's guilt and confusion over him is written so vividly.Like I said before, this book approaches mental illness and depression so well.\nHow could a person like her be depressed? She was full of energy and life and passion. The word depressed made me think of this group of kids at school who wore all black and thick eyeliner and listened to angry music and never showed their teeth. The ones who people sometimes called emo, making it sound like a bad word.My mother wasn\u2019t like that. Not at all.\nThis book doesn't glorify depression and suicide by any means, but it is so beautifully written. It was a long book, but definitely worth the read.

I became interested in this book after seeing it pop up on my feed quite a lot but it also appeared as one of the \"most anticipated releases of 2018\" for those Booktubers some of us are familiar with. I must say, this has definitely become a favorite of mine. What makes it better is that it's an own voices book, and I do think this is one of the best debuts I've ever read. Leigh Chen Sanders did not ever think the day she kissed her best friend would be the day she would find her mom lying dead on the floor with a bottle of sleeping pills on one side and a bloody knife on the other side. One thing she does believe though is that her mother has turned into a bird. A red bird, specifically. She is determined to find out why her mother committed suicide after she finds her suicide note. Leigh, being half Asian because of her Taiwanese-born mother and half White beause of her Irish-American father, she travels to Taipei, Taiwan to meet her grandparents, the people she had wished to meet for a very long time but never was able to for reasons she never knew. As she is trying to improve her Mandarin and is building a relationship with her maternal grandparents, she is set in a world she never knew about. Set in the past and present, reality and magic, The Astonishing Color of After introduces us to the life of Leigh and how begins discovering secrets about her family, chases after ghosts and her mother-bird, learns about her Asian heritage, and begins to wonder what hope and love means.Trigger/content warnings for depression and suicide. Emily provides the past and younger life of Leigh as she is growing up and we see how her mom went from shining her beautiful smile to losing her hope in life. The book does not focus on suicide nor on depression. Depression is mentioned and is something Dory, Leigh's mother, struggled with, but it wasn't the biggest role of the book. In reality, Leigh wants to find out why her mother killed herself. \n\nLight the match. Touch the stick of incense\u2014its tip alight and calm as an ember\u2014to the vane of the feather.\n\nI've read articles and watched videos stating East Asian countries are one of the highest (if not the highest) countries with suicide rates. There's a video I watched where a girl was so focused on school and her work but later became tired, stressed and sad that all she wanted to do was fly. The video has been taken down but it actually became viral, having comments of comparison between education in South Korea vs other countries. It was based and set in South Korea, but these things happen in all countries including Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, etc. Mental health is a struggle everyone faces. Whether they have been diagnosed with an illness or not, everyone has something. I myself have panic disorder but I have also suffered from depression and so, because of my personal experience, I actually enjoy reading about mental health portrayed in books. Mental health, though, varies in countries. I don't want to get into further detail because I am no expert in mental health statistics, but the views of mental health in East Asia there needs to change, at least slowly, and we can do something about that. \n\nMy mother is a bird.And I am only a girl.A girl, human and wingless\u2014but what I have is the beginning of a plan.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this book was the cover. I thought it shone brightly and beautifully at the bookstore that I told myself I would buy it next time I make a stop at B&N. It didn't happen until I was fully convinced I wanted to read this book. It has easily become one of my favorite books of the year and I will definitely be looking forward to the future works the author plans on publishing. I think the most beautiful part of this is that it's an own-voices book. Emily X.R. Pan was born in the U.S. but her parents are immigrants from Taiwan. I think it's amazing when people, authors or not, bring in their own heritage and culture and experience to any sort of writing piece or art form or musical sheet. She really managed to engross me with the world-building and the Asian heritage and the characters. Her writing was very easy to follow but it was also poignant, artistic and lyrical, short and prepossessing. I actually took Mandarin for 3 years. I still remember my 2 favorite sentences: \u6211\u559c\u6b22\u5496\u5561\u3002\u6211\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u6c49\u5821\u5305\u3002 Also, my name was \u6885\u59ec\u3002So, to the ones who understand, \u4f60\u597d\uff01\u6211\u53eb\u6885\u59ec\u3002My school requires all students to take a Language Arts class and the only options were Spanish and Mandarin. I'm fluent in Spanish and the teacher was an American-born self-taught Spanish speaker, so I figured it would be better for me to take a language I was a complete stranger to. I took it for three years and, although it was interesting and nice to learn, I wouldn't go back to it. I guess it was because I wasn't completely focused on the language that I barely managed to pass the class for 3 years. It was beautiful, yes, but very difficult. So, with that being said, my teacher was actually born in Taiwan and immigrated to the United States to learn English. She would talk about her days there and would give us brief overviews of it even though we couldn't do anything but imagine it. Emily actually built a beautiful world in the book. She described Taipei in beautiful ways and it was very easy to imagine it. Since Leigh's grandparents were from Taiwan, they, of course, spoke the language. There were so many characters and words I knew and remembered and was able to pronounce correctly with the right tone and it was actually nice seeing that; nice seeing a language I was quite familiar with. Another thing I liked was the descriptions of the traditions, the food, the celebrations\u2014the different cultures every country has is just really interesting to me. Knowing my family and I have our own culture and traditions, it's beautiful and interesting to see how different others are. \n\nHold your finger to the sky with so much force it lengthens like a spine. Look up to the point of it and beyond. Thre. That tiny patch of the world, no bigger than the tip of your finger. At first glance, it might just look like one flat color.

Those are the colors of right now.\n\nThroughout Leigh's journey, we see that she begins to try and discover why her mother killed herself. She begins to see that it wasn't a person or an event, but depression itself. She begins to see that sometimes people lose faith and hope in life that there's nothing else to do. She blames herself for it and wishes she could've done something else about it, but she discovers things on her own that give her the answers she wants. Magical realism is also something that I think the author managed to portray correctly. I think the whole idea of the main character being consumed by a shadow or dark dust, taking her back to the past and showing a memory of her mother, father, herself, or any other memory added mystery to the novel, but also entertainment. When Leigh saw her younger self smiling, shining, laughing with her mother, I felt like I wanted to capture the moment. One of the things Emily managed to do was impact me. I mean, after reading this, I began realizing even more than you really never know when or how you'll lose a loved one. Leigh is a teenage girl who struggles with grief, loss, and hopelessness until she looks for her answers and brings back everything she lost. The story is about how a teenage girl manages deal with her grief. I actually felt bad for Leigh. She really wanted to learn about herself and her other heritage and was never able to meet her grandparents even though she really wanted to. She also wishes she looked more Taiwanese when she was in Taiwan because the people there would call her mixed blood and give her dirty looks at times because of how she looked\u2014her white skin, brown hair and green tips. I can see where she came from though. I mean, I sometimes get sad when I don't know about my Hispanic tradition. I wasn't born in El Salvador, but my parents were, and its been years but they're still trying to remember everything they celebrated and did when they were teenagers. I still appreciate the fact that they try their best to bring out the tradition of their country and teach it to me. Slang too, slang is important y'all!Okay, there were quite a lot of things I liked about this, but another thing was the color distinguishing of emotions. Also called, synesthesia. I really enjoyed reading about Axel, her best friend and the boy she likes, and how he would always ask what color she was feeling when there was an event occurring. It was either bright and vibrant or dark and shady. The colors would represent what each was feeling, either red for love, white for neutral, and so on. Now that I've mentioned Axel, diversity also has a role in this book. I mentioned before that Leigh is half White and half Asian, but Axel was also from Asia, specifically from Filipino descendant. There weren't any terms or the language of The Philippines was never brought up, but the small elements of it was a plus in the book. I wish it had more of it and Axel would actually bring parts of it up, but the book wasn't about that so I didn't completely wish for it. Leigh also had a friend who was lesbian and so the representation of LGBT was brought in but again, it was not the main focus.I won't lie, the only problem I had with this was that it felt too long. I mean, it might be because the chapters were short. It reminded me of Artistotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe and how sometimes one chapter would be one page long. I didn't mind it because it actually allowed me to read the book faster, but the length of the book felt like it was too long. \n\nThere's no point in wishing. We can't change anything about the past. We can only remember. We can only move forward.\n\nOverall, Emily X.R. Pan has written a thought-provoking and beautiful story about a teenage girl finding herself with the help of her mother, as a bird, guiding her. This debut has definitely won me over and I really hope Emily actually continues, or at least is interested in, writing more books with mental health representation. The setting was beautifully imaginative. The writing was artistic and I loved how she used art as a form of expressions and thoughts. Art and magical realism combined created a beautiful story, and I hope there are more people who allow this book to be a part of their lives by creating an artistic journey as they're reading it."}, {"userName": "jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10171516-jessica", "userReview": "can we all just take a moment to appreciate that this is a debut??!!? like, honestly. i am the astonishing colour of impressed. this book definitely didnt read like it was an authors first work. this was magic. just the imagery alone was outstanding - it showcased dealing with grief in such beautiful and colourful way! i really hope emily pan chooses to write another book because i need more of her writing!  4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37089590-april", "userReview": "This book hit home for me.

We can't change anything about the past. We can only remember. We can only move forward.Last December, many K-pop fans (myself included) were distraught when SHINee's Jonghyun committed suicide. Following this tragedy, EXO's Baekhyun was criticized for saying that he didn't know why people get depressed. These events in the K-pop world piqued my interest and made me realize that depression isn't something that shouldn't be taken lightly, especially now that more and more people in Asia are falling into its dangerous clutches. Since I personally haven't experienced depression or had suicidal thoughts, books like this provide an opportunity for vicarious learning. When I read such literature, I look for enlightenment, not entertainment. Hence, although 462 pages seems to long for a YA contemporary novel, I am glad that I pushed through.The Astonishing Color of After is primarily a melancholic book. In fact, most of the blurbs at the back have the word \"grief.\" It is about a girl named Leigh, whose mother has committed suicide. Strangely, Leigh believes that her mother has turned into a bird. After Leigh finds her mother's suicide note, she travels to Taiwan in order to meet her maternal grandparents for the first time. There, Leigh reminisces about her past, tries to find the mysterious bird, and gradually unveils the painful secrets of her family. In totality, this book is both literally and figuratively heavy.One reason why I enjoyed this book is that it reiterated the biological aspect of depression. As a Christian, I used to believe that depression was mostly spiritual in nature. With that in mind, reading this book made me acknowledge the fallibility of this idea. After all, if depression were only a spiritual problem, it couldn't be cured or managed by modern medicine. In the book, Leigh's mom underwent various kinds of therapy that made her feel better by altering the chemical composition of her brain. Research has proven that people with depression generally have lower levels of happy hormones, such as dopamine and serotonin. Thus, it would be foolish and unfair to assume that depressed people have something wrong with their faith or spiritual lives. Doing so could even be a form of ableism. Yes, my Christianity makes me experience life in a different way. But I don't believe that it makes me immune to depression. I actually have a friend who suffers from depression, and it makes me sad that he/she was ostracized by some of the members of her own church. With all that said, I am grateful that this book taught me that we shouldn't judge people with depression, an illness that has so many layers.Another reason why I liked TACOA is that it exposed me to Chinese/Taiwanese culture. Aside from numerous descriptions of food, there were discussions on death, marriage, and more. Thus, this book made me hungry for food and information. I currently don't have the means to travel to foreign countries, so I'm glad that books like this enable me to experience different cultures from the comfort of my bed. Hahaha. Chinese culture already thrives here in the Philippines, but I would love to experience it in its purest form by visiting China someday.The last reason for my enjoyment has something to do with this thing called love. I mentioned before that TACOA is a melancholic book, but don't worry because there are actually some light and fluffy parts. I was particularly fond of the chapters featuring Axel, Leigh's best friend. I've always been a fan of the best-friends-to-lovers trope (because it prevents any case of instalove), and the author utilized it almost perfectly. Still, it would've been better if Axel hadn't offended my feminist sensibilities by using a certain girl as a so-called distraction.Looking back, the main problem that I had with this book was its color-related metaphors. In this regard, the writing reminded me of Stephanie Garber's Caraval. Leigh and Axel were very gifted artists, and they had this thing of conveying their emotions by naming very unfamiliar colors. For example, jealousy was this special kind of green, guilt was this shade of orange, etc. You can just read the book's title if you don't get what I'm trying to say. It takes a lot of imagination to comprehend the color of \"after\" and other abstract concepts.Despite the latter complaint, I highly recommend The Astonishing Color of After because it gave me an enlightening reading experience. It's a book that can start discussions on topics that people usually avoid: depression and suicide. Also, it introduces readers to the beauty of Asian/Chinese culture. If anything, the sweet romance is just a bonus. Overall, kudos to another contemporary novel with very meaningful and relevant content.P.S. Other noteworthy virtues of TACOA include:1. Diversity (Leigh is half-Chinese and Axel is half-Filipino)2. Heartwarming family dynamics3. Magical plot twists4.

She was full of energy and life and passion.

Some people will probably be annoyed by the heavy emphasis on color in the writing, but I think it worked splendidly. It sorta gave this book a more distinct identity, like the running theme of colors is its gimmick. Plus, the main character Leigh is a budding artist, so it made all the more sense.

I was immediately drawn to this book because of the main character who is biracial (half-white, half-Asian) like myself. Little did I know what a wild and heartfelt journey this book would be.The great thing is that I won this review copy from a giveaway hosted by TheNovl. I was completely shocked when it came because 1) I never win anything, and 2) little did I think it would be one of my most anticipated releases of 2018!TRIGGER WARNINGS: Suicide, depression, self-harmI have a confession: I don\u2019t really like magical realism. I mean, it\u2019s not a genre I normally gravitate toward like I do fantasy. But I think I\u2019ll soon stick my foot in my mouth because when magical realism is done well, I will eat. It. Up. (As I did with The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender a few years ago.) The fantastic thing with this book is I did just that. It was a joy to return to this book over and over again.Emily\u2019s writing is beautiful, lush, full of imagery and packed with emotion. It was lovely to follow Leigh and experience a new world with her with her grandparents in Taiwan. We see Leigh struggle through her mother\u2019s suicide, and how she uses various mediums to help her cope with the pain. Her journey in Taiwan was perfect and exactly what she needed\u2013to be able to connect with the family she\u2019s never met until this very moment. Even though there was a language barrier between Leigh and her grandparents, she worked through it (with some help from her father and a new friend) and we see how she builds a relationship with her grandparents, mends the one with her father, and returns to the one she has with her best friend, Axel.Personally, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lose someone to suicide. I know what it\u2019s like to be the one with suicidal thoughts, though, and it\u2019s always incredibly heartbreaking to watch someone go through that like Leigh\u2019s mother, Dory. What\u2019s even worse is that in many Asian communities, you just don\u2019t talk about mental illness. Quite frankly, you really just don\u2019t talk about your feelings, and if you do, sometimes people often push it aside. I think that\u2019s what happened a bit with Dory and her parents, along with a variety of other issues. It\u2019s evident some traditional, cultural expectations were put on Dory by her parents, and we don\u2019t see the outcome of that until later.It\u2019s so fortunate that Leigh was able to see parts of her grandparents\u2019 and parents\u2019 past. I think that\u2019s what makes this book so endearing and so hopeful. Leigh thinks she is left in the dark, but she finds a little bit of hope and answers, the latter which most people never find about their lost loved one.I loved the interweaving of art and music throughout the book, too.But that doesn\u2019t mean I found some parts disconcerting. I really didn\u2019t like Leigh\u2019s father until closer to the end. He did some really crappy things, and I\u2019m unsure if I can reconcile his actions, and if he was simply acting that way due to his lack of being able to cope with the loss of his wife. It was really frustrating reading some demeaning parts in regards to his daughter\u2019s hobbies. But some of the later revelations about the connections he held together were really heartfelt.I will praise this book for capturing so well what it felt like to be biracial. Even though I\u2019m not Taiwanese, I was able to relate to a variety of situations and observations Leigh made. I haven\u2019t read many books with biracial characters as the main characters, and like I said in the beginning, it\u2019s the first thing that attracted me to this book.

It also holds heavy focal themes such as suicide, mental illness, and grief. The story follows a confused daughter, Leigh, in the aftermath of her mother's suicide, and the author incorporates magical realism into the story as Leigh tries to make sense out of this life-changing event. From the perspective of a young girl trying to deal with her grief, this young-adult book was interesting to follow, especially as Leigh's emotions were given color and the spiritual concept of limbo was explored. The Taiwanese cultural element was my absolute favorite thing about this book, and I really enjoyed following Leigh's friendship with Axel. However, being a clinician who has worked with the young-adult population for years, I couldn't help but wonder what a young reader who has mental health issues of their own may take away from this book. The notion that suicide may lead to an afterlife situation in which everyone will find answers and understanding and forgiveness and will live happily ever after...I couldn't get past this. Yes, this is fiction and yes, the magical realism/fantasy is just that...fantasy. I know, and I'm probably being too sensitive about this but my internal concern for an at-risk reader distracted me a great deal from this reading experience. If you are or have ever considered suicide, please know that it will not all work out for the people you leave behind. They will not understand the why of it. It will not bring anyone closer together or reunite bonds that were lost. You 99.9% likely will not be in a position to send your loved ones messages or clues from the afterlife. Emily X.R. Pan is not using this beautiful story as a giant metaphor or whatever the applicable word is. She does however want you to talk about what you're feeling and seek help, as she so thoughtfully and delicately wrote in her author's note at the end. Please, tell someone. I know sometimes the darkness is all-consuming and you literally cannot see another option but just hang on and speak. You are not alone. And if you are the someone who is seeing red flags, ask. Talk. End the stigma. It\u2019s a disease, not just a bad day.Note: I initially rated this book 3 stars but have since removed my rating altogether since I feel this book had an unintended impact. Maybe it was meant to be and someone needed to hear these words. Likewise, surely there will be a grieving teen out there that will desperately need to hear Emily X.R. Pan's words. Everything happens for a reason, right?My favorite quote:\u201cThere's no point in wishing. We can't change anything about the past. We can only remember. We can only move forward.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly", "userReview": "There is not a single thing in this book I did not love. The lush writing. The use of color. The exploration of family secrets and stories. Of culture. Or belief. But the thing that hit hardest was the way depression is rendered. This is a book about grief in the wake of suicide that comes from a depressive episode (or series of them, in this instance). There is no \"reason\" here. There's no boogeyman moment, wherein we get the why of suicide. Rather, we're forced, like Leigh is, to wrestle with the lack of answers. We're forced to understand not everything makes sense. That magical thinking is both a good thing -- when it can help you work through grief, when it can help you find the things you're looking for, the dreams you want to achieve -- and a bad thing -- when you believe what it is your brain tells you about your worth and value. I'm going to hold on to this for a long, long time. One of the best YA books I've read this year, and certainly one of the best I've read in a long time. Perfect for fans of Nova Ren Suma or Laura Ruby. Our main character is a Taiwanese/Chinese American girl, and her story involves a trip to Taiwan to meet her grandparents for the first time. But it is so, so much more than that."}, {"userName": "Fafa's Book Corner", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7366569-fafa-s-book-corner", "userReview": "Mini review:Trigger warning: Depression and suicideDNFI have seen this book everywhere.

I hadn\u2019t heard much about THE ASTONISHING COLOR OF AFTER before I was lucky enough to receive a copy of this gorgeous novel in my mailbox. After I read the synopsis, I became so excited to read this, especially because it features a Chinese-American protagonist, written by an #ownvoices author.THE ASTONISHING COLOR OF AFTER follows Leigh, whose Chinese mother committed suicide. As a result, she is pushed to go to Taiwan to meet her maternal grandparents. Along the way, she becomes more encompassed by her Chinese heritage and learns more about her family history. This novel is written by revealing the timelines of the past and present, through flashbacks and memories. This made this novel so unique, unraveling Leigh\u2019s family\u2019s history in short yet packed chapters. My only reservation of this novel is that I felt like some parts of the novel lagged and felt a tad exhausting to read.Leigh was a lovely main character \u2013 she\u2019s torn because of her mother\u2019s suicide, which happened to be on the same day that she kissed her best friend Axel. I really enjoyed seeing her grow from the beginning of the the novel to the end, during which she reforms and develops relationships with her grandparents and her dad.Overall, THE ASTONISHING COLOR OF AFTER is a lovely debut novel that deals with grief and learning to move on through family history, art, and love. If you\u2019re looking for a wonderfully diverse novel with fantastic Chinese-American representation as well as artistic writing, be sure to check this one out.Thank you to the Novl for sending me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Nadia", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60021454-nadia", "userReview": "\u201dEverything fades. Everything in the physical world, like paper and furniture, but also things in the mind. Memories, emotions. Life. Friendships. Those fade, too. It\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d\n4 stars TW:suicide, depressionread full review here*full review include favorite quotes and a spoiler sectionOkay, so this book gave me multiple existential crises, so I hope you enjoy reading this review while I sit here and ponder the nature of my existence. \nThe Writing\nOkay, so the first thing I noticed about the writing was that there were a LOT of metaphors and similes. A lot. And I actually really enjoyed it with this Emily X. R. Pan\u2019s writing. None of them were cringy (see: Emergency Contact) and they fit pretty well with the tone of the story. I also loved how the main character has this thing with her best friend where she describes emotions using colors \u2013 the way that it plays out in the writing was absolutely wonderful to see. Colors were used to describe emotions in this, and it was so very well done, and you could tie it back to the title, and ahdhethiot IT WAS SO SMART!! Also, the overall tone of this story is a mix of grief and mystery and it was so delightful to read. There was also the whole thing with repetition of the same words at different points used to make a point. So that was fun to watch, too. Overall, I felt like this was a very distinct writing style, and I love it!!\nThe Plot/Pacing\nI have a note that says \u201cTHE TENSION!! THE FORESHADOWING!!\u201d and I feel like this is basically a summary of the plot. The book was originally slow to start up in terms of plot, but then, at around 200-250 pages in, it just because unputdownable. There was so much happening and I was so eager to see where the story would go, and I,,,, aaaaahhh!!! And the last 100 pages held so many mindblowing plot twists that I actually started questioning my own existence, and it was really fun. For a more objective statement, this book is told partially through flashbacks and partially through things happening in the present, and I imagine that was a pain to plot, but the author does a really good job with the dual storyline, and having them both lead up to a climax and making the pieces finally come together in a moment that makes you go \u201cOH!\u201d Actually, there were several \u201coh!\u201d moments throughout this, and they were all really well done.\nThe Characters\nOkay, so first of all, let me just give a quick mention to the rep in this book. Our main character is Taiwanese-American, and though I cannot speak for the accuracy of the rep, I will say the rep is ownvoices. Additionally, there is also a side character who is mixed Filipino and Puerto-Rican, and another side character who is a queer girl (I am pretty sure she is a lesbian, but her label is never explicitly stated).Okay, now let\u2019s talk about the characters. Leigh is quite a complicated one \u2013 she wants so much and feels like she needs to do so much, and just feels in general so much. In this book, she is also grieving her mother and experiences a lot of survivor\u2019s guilt. And though I cannot speak for the accuracy of that, the author does say that she has had personal experience with losing a loved one to suicide, so there\u2019s that. I did really enjoy Leigh\u2019s character and how raw it felt. It was wonderful to see!I can\u2019t really say much about the side character because, to me, they felt really underdeveloped, though I will say I did enjoy both Axel\u2019s and Caro\u2019s impact on the story, and what we did get to see of their personalities.\nThe World\nOriginally, I wasn\u2019t sure if I should do a section on the world because, for the most part, this is set in the real world (in Taiwan too!! How awesome is that??) but eventually I decided I did want to do one because I wanted to talk about some of the magical aspects. And also quickly mention that I learned a lot about Taiwanese culture thanks to this book. And I loved how some of the mythology/religious beliefs could be related to the magic!! It was just so cool to read! And it was really well done!!!\nOverall\nOkay to close us off, I would just like to mention some important topics discussed in this. Grief, suicide, and survivor\u2019s guilt are already mentioned above, but in addition to those, the book also discusses racism, especially in relation to Eastern Asian people (including everyday racism), and as this book takes place in Taiwan for the majority of the time, it also discusses the hostility towards \u201cexotic\u201d (non-Asian) people there, which was really interesting to see. Other than that, I am sure you all can guess that I really enjoyed this book and am going to tell you to go read it in a second if you haven\u2019t yet. You should go read this book if you haven\u2019t yet, by the way!!! But yeah, that\u2019s as far as my thoughts go.~~~this book was existential-crisis-inducing, and I loved it.
