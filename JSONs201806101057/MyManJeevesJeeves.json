One of the rummy things about Jeeves is that, unless you watch like a hawk, you very seldom see him come into a room. He's like one of those weird chappies in India who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where they want them.Most people today probable associate Jeeves with the man that has all the answers not because they have read P.G. Wodehouse, but because they have accessed Ask Jeeves on the web. \nNot the Jeeves I knowOver the years I've read Wodehouse here and there, but it has been so long since I've read most of them that I have decided to go back through the entire works of Wodehouse. Overlook Press has reissued Wodehouse in affordable hardback editions that are actually kind of fun to collect. http://www.overlookpress.com/p-g-wode...This collection of stories is equally split between four Jeeves and Wooster stories, and four stories with an early version of Bertie Wooster under the name Reggie Peppers. There was such a shift in style between the Jeeves stories and moving into the Peppers stories that I actually looked at the book to see if I had grabbed the right one. There is humor in the Peppers stories, but nothing like the graceful, yet ribald wit of the Jeeves and Wooster stories. I had no clue that Reggie Peppers existed in the Wodehouse world so I'm a bit gleeful to make his acquaintance. I was popping off answers to emails at work yesterday and after reading back through one such message I discovered bits of Wodehouse lilt to my language. I had to go back through and tone my word choices down. I've found living in the Midwest it is best to take any elevated language or tone out of my writing because people here assume that I am showing off. Also don't sound too happy about anything or they will think you are going crazy. My point being though is that Wodehouse's writing style is so engaging and contagious. He is also laugh out loud funny and here is one example out of many that had me chortling. Lady Malvern was a hearty, happy, healthy, overpowering sort of dashing female, not so very tall but making up for it by measuring about six feet from the O.P. to the Prompt Side. She fitted into my biggest arm-chair as if it had been built round her by some one who knew they were wearing arm-chairs tight around the hips that season. Okay so part of the reason this was so funny to me was I had one of the people that work for me in my office for a yearly evaluation. She was sitting in one of my office chairs. \nEverything went swimmingly until we finished and she got up to leave. She is one of those women that are pear shaped. She took two steps with the chair still attached to her hips and then the chair just popped off. I have to give myself credit I held it together. My brain was scrambling for something to say that A)wouldn't make me laugh and B)wouldn't come across in any way shape or form as insulting. I came up with are you alright?. She laughed and said that she might need to lose some weight or I might need to get some bigger chairs. I notice now when she comes in to talk to me that she lists to one side to keep one hip from hooking under the arm of the chair. So I laughed at Bertie's assessment of Lady Malvern's tight fit in his arm-chair and the memory it inspired of the chair incident in my office. Now of course I couldn't read the books without seeing Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie as Jeeves and Wooster. I have watched the series twice and if you haven't seen it you are really in for a treat. Several stories from this book were lifted for episodes. Much of the dialogue is exactly the same because how could you improve on the wit and repartee of Wodehouse?\nI endeavor to give satisfaction, sir.Now part of the charm of Hugh Laurie playing Wooster is that his facial expressions are just priceless. He does gobsmacked about as well as anyone in the film industry. I find myself laughing out loud at his expression without him having to say a word. For me, Tim Conway is the funniest man ever, but Hugh Laurie as Wooster is on the short list. \nI tried to think of something to say, but nothing came. A chappie has to be a lot broader about the forehead than I am to handle a jolt like this. I strained the old bean till it creaked, but between the collar and the hair parting nothing stirred.\nMost disturbing, sir.Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse in 1955 was naturalized as an American citizen. We do our best to steal the most talented from around the world. He wrote 96 books, so I will have my work cut out for me to read them all, but it is also such a relief to know that there are so many of them and each one I'm sure will elicit a heady combination of snorts, snickers, and chuckles. Wodehouse lived to be 93 serving notice to the rest of us that comedians who avoid early deaths from drug abuse tend to live to a ripe old age. I suggest to all that you read Wodehouse, laugh out loud don't smother your glee, let it out, and in the process you will be healthier, and will, according to studies, live longer. Keep a Wodehouse handy for a day when you are feeling glum.\nP. G. Wodehouse\nPrecisely sir.

This one contains 9 stories with 5 of them telling Jeeves and Wooster adventures in New York. The first one was decent enough, but nothing to write home about; the next one finally delivered: it was amusing, clever, and the way Jeeves dealt with yet another difficult situation finally made me his big fan. I also need to mention that these 5 were all good: some better some worse, but in general good.This leaves us with 4 stories. These are about a guy named Reggie Pepper whose numerous friends end up in desperate situations usually due to their wives/girlfriends/fiancees, etc. The guy does not have an advantage to have Jeeves as his manservant so as a result he often gets the short end of the stick while trying to help. While as the whole I liked these less the second Reggie Pepper story contained the only scene of the book which made me laugh out loud. Reading this book made me realize something I hate to admit. Every single one of the problems of friends of Wooster and Pepper could be completely solved by making them (friends that is) getting a soul-sucking job 9 to 5 the majority of modern people have; every single one. And here I thought I would never say anything nice about soul-sucking jobs. Oh well, I guess I learned something new. In the conclusion the book was amusing enough to earn 4 stars, just do not expect laugh out loud scaring the people around you while reading. Yes, I will continue reading about further misadventures of Bernie Wooster and Jeeves."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "Slapstick Aristocracy? I guess that pretty much sums it up. The butler is always smarter and more ingenious than anyone else in the book. :)It's pretty and pretty much the beginning of all other similar writings and imitators, and for that, I really appreciate it. Moreso, it's funny and still relevant even if it's just a tad dated. We've still got tons of historical novel interest, but this one was timely for its day in 1919.The timing and the idiocy and the fairly complicated plotting in the background really made poor Wooster shine as the idjit that he is. I heartily recommend this for anyone interested in the humorous classics."}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "What ho! This Goodreads review lark is a rummy thing. Here I sit, drinking buckets of tea, that indispensable tissue restorative, waiting for the old muse to come up with something, squeezing the old bean until it turns purple, and the blighted screen remains stubbornly blank. What is a frightful chump like me to do? How interesting it must be to be one of those animal-trainer Johnnies: to stimulate the dawning intelligence, and that sort of thing.Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, best portrayal of J&W ever.OK, if I keep that sort of faux-Wodehouse business up the old bean will surely explode\u2014or possibly implode. Still, one must endeavor to give satisfaction and all that sort of rot. It\u2019s been many years since I read a Wodehouse book, there was a time when I could not get enough of them. Unfortunately if you read to many of them one after the other they do tend to seem very similar and the magic fades. Better to not over indulge, don\u2019t you know.P.G. Wodehouse\u2019s books are kind of magical, though, there is never any substance to them that I can discern, no moral lessons or in-depth exploration of the human condition. They are just fun and astonishingly written. Wodehouse wrote several series of books, but the most popular one by far is clearly the \u201cJeeves and Wooster\u201d series.Fortunately, quite a few of Wodehouse\u2019s books are in the public domain including My Man Jeeves. My Man Jeeves is a collection of eight short stories, half of them featuring Jeeves and Wooster, the others feature Reggie Pepper, one of Wodehouse\u2019s less well known (and less funny) protagonists. In any event, none of the stories fail to raise a smile or the odd chuckles. I don\u2019t expect to split my sides reading a Wodehouse book, his humour is not in the style of  Douglas Adams or Monty Python, though he may have been an inspiration for both of them. It is enough that his stories are \u201cextremely diverting\u201d, uplifting, and it is wonderful just to soak up the language, don\u2019t you know. It has been said\u2014by some literary Johnnies\u2014that Wodehouse did not simply write but orchestrated the English language. Who am I to argue with these brainy blighters?All the stories are about helping a friend out of a difficult situation, usually disinheritance; and they tend to involve deception, stealing or a harebrained scheme of some kind. If the scheme is Jeeves\u2019 it usually works, sometimes with unexpected results, if it is anybody else\u2019s they go pear-shaped\u2014landing the schemer \u201cin the soup\u201d. Reggie Pepper\u2014like Bertie Wooster\u2014is a \u201cgentleman of leisure\u201d, living off an inheritance and spends all his time amusing himself. Reggie is a little bit brighter than Bertie and also has a butler called Voules, who speaks like Jeeves but is not nearly as intelligent or concerned about his employer\u2019s wellbeing. Reggie\u2019s schemes for helping his friends always go awry. The most memorable one is when he kidnaps a child in order for his friend to present said child back to his cute auntie, and be regarded as a hero. It transpires that the child is not related to the girl at all.The Jeeves and Wooster stories are all set in New York, where Bertie is on the run from his irate Aunt Agatha. My favorite of the four stories is \u201cThe Aunt and the Sluggard\u201d which involves his friend Rocky Todd and Rocky\u2019s formidable aunt. Bertie has to pretend that Rocky owns his flat which results in his being evicted from his own residence by the aunt who takes an immediate dislike to him:\u201cThe aunt took the chair which I'd forgotten to offer her. She looked at me in rather a rummy way. It was a nasty look. It made me feel as if I were something the dog had brought in and intended to bury later on, when he had time. My own Aunt Agatha, back in England, has looked at me in exactly the same way many a time, and it never fails to make my spine curl.\u201dWhen I review a short story collection I usually write a brief note for each individual story. Not this time, old scout, the stories tend to be fairly similar. \u201cThe cases are in some respects parallel, sir\u201d, as Jeeves would say. They are all pretty much top-hole. If you are feeling down and need cheering up it occurs to me that reading My Man Jeeves might prove efficacious.Toodle-oo!Note:Librivox audiobook read by Mark Nelson, an American chappie, don\u2019t you know, but he did a corking job. American accent for all the British characters notwithstanding, but narrated with plenty of vim!Quotes:Wodehouse is one of the most quotable authors ever. Here are some of my favorites from this book:Thick Bertie\u201cI'm a bit short on brain myself; the old bean would appear to have been constructed more for ornament than for use, don't you know.\u201dSuperhero Jeeves\u201cHe's like one of those weird chappies in India who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space in a sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where they want them.\u201d\u201cHe flowed silently out of the room\u2014he always gives you the impression of being some liquid substance when he moves.\u201dJeeves\u2019 enigmatic smile\u201cJeeves smiled paternally. Or, rather, he had a kind of paternal muscular spasm about the mouth, which is the nearest he ever gets to smiling.\u201dReggie Pepper\u201cA fellow who may have been a perfect knight-errant to a girl when he was engaged to her, doesn't feel nearly so keen on spreading himself in that direction when she has given him the miss-in-baulk, and gone and married a man who reason and instinct both tell him is a decided blighter.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Trevor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor", "userReview": "One of the things Good Reads is particularly good for is answering strange little questions about ourselves. Questions we might not think to ask otherwise, but then when we do ask make us wonder how else we would ever have known\u2026 For example, the other day it struck me that I don\u2019t really read any Wodehouse in the Summertime. And I\u2019ve been able to check when I read all my Wodehouse's and it is true. I guess the reason for that is that I don\u2019t need his warmth and sunlight and laughter in the Summertime, but come the Winter he is like a hotwater bottle in between starched white sheets. An unexpected warmth when all seems icy and unforgiving.I listened to this as a talking book and it was good. But the problem with the first story on the cd is that Jeeves is the narrator \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t quite work, in much the same way that stories where Holmes is the narrator don't quite work. You need to hear the story from the perspective of the guy doing the oooos and ahhhhs, not the magician. Still, couldn\u2019t have come at a better time \u2013 utter magic."}, {"userName": "Sean Gibson", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20955173-sean-gibson", "userReview": "If you\u2019re in the throes of dark days, you\u2019ve got three main options to turn to in order to get you through: mind-altering substances, food, and P.G. Wodehouse. While there are very few things a good Old Fashioned and a plate of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies can\u2019t improve, Wodehouse might be the most effective remedy of all.As noted in a review of another Wodehouse classic, Jeeves and Wooster stories are highly formulaic, and the delight in reading them comes not from plot, but from Wodehouse\u2019s bracingly hilarious prose and what-the-hell-does-that-mean slang. This book is no different, but take note: not every story contained herein is a Jeeves and Wooster story; some of them are Reggie Pepper stories, which knocks this down a star rating.Why, you ask? Well, Reggie stories are like Jeeves and Wooster-lite. Reggie was, as I understand it, a prototype for Bertie Wooster, and it\u2019s clear that the idea wasn\u2019t fully baked. The Reggie stories lack the effervescent charm and over-the-top hilarity of his descendent. Given the sequencing in this book (Jeeves/Wooster stories, a brace of Reggie stories, and then back to Jeeves and Wooster), it\u2019s a little bit like buying a Led Zeppelin album, rocking out to the first four songs, and then puzzling out why Robert Plant and company apparently took a break to do lines of coke off of a groupie\u2019s backside while letting Whitesnake handle the next three songs before coming back to bang out the final two tunes themselves. Still, Wodehouse is always worth a go, and I\u2019ll be back again for another cracking wheeze the next time I\u2019m feeling rummy."}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "I've read this all before! I know I sometimes complain that once you've read one Wodehouse story you've read them all, but no, I mean I literally have read all these stories already. Ah well, I've also seen every episode of shows like All In The Family or Are You Being Served? about half a dozen times, so why not give these wonderful words a rerun read through?Well the answer would be because this is not Wodehouse's best effort at joining up words in a pleasing manner. He's had better goes at it with say The Code of the Woosters, The Mating Season or Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves. And then there's the issue of all these Jeeves & Wooster stories being set in New York. I've never been a fan of the stories set in America and I finally put my finger upon the why. Wodehouse's American characters living in America are dull. They lack the daffy spark of his English ones or even his Americans visiting the UK. What is it about England that makes them all go hilariously looney? Must be something in the gin water. AND THEN there's the issue of the title. When a book's titled My Man Jeeves it'd better be carpetted wall-to-wall with Jeeves. This is not. Only about half of the stories are about the Jeeves and Wooster dynamic duo. The rest are about Reggie Peppers, who is a Bertie Wooster-lite. If I was to bottomline all this, I'd say My Man Jeeves is not a rotten potato from the first Bush administration that you've finally unearthed from behind the fridge. No, it's a decent enough book and a good one to start off your Wodehouse reading career. However, there's better hilarity to be found amongst the author's canon."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "I'd seen the 1990's British show Jeeves and Wooster back in junior high, but this was my first time actually reading the stories. I loved them, especially the way the character Jeeves himself breaks every stereotype of the mindless lapdog valet, proving himself to be extremely intelligent and unexpectedly resourceful despite his constant dedication to his job. There's tons of weird humor in the stories and all kinds of small adventures, not to mention wacky versions of the rich and strange and also Wooster himself, a well-meaning but not particularly bright guy who sort of just happened to fall into good fortune but doesn't flaunt it around the way people might expect. My only problem with this anthology is that only have its stories were actually about the titular characters; the rest were about a somewhat unmemorable character who wasn't nearly as interesting."}, {"userName": "Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30817744-sandy-the-world-could-end-while-i-was-reading-and-i-would-never-notice", "userReview": "EXCERPT: Jeeves - my man, you know - is really a most extraordinary chap. So capable. Honestly, I shouldn't know what to do without him. On broader lines he's like those chappies who sit peering over the marble battlements in the Pennsylvania Station in the place marked 'inquiries'. You know the Johnnies I mean. You go up to them and say: 'When's the next train for Melonsquashville, Tennessee?' and they reply, without stopping to think, \"Two-forty-Three, track Ten, change at San Francisco.\" And they're right, every time. Well, Jeeves gives you the same impression of omniscience. THE BLURB: Who can forget our beloved gentleman's personal gentleman, Jeeves, who ever comes to the rescue when the hapless Bertie Wooster falls into trouble. My Man Jeeves is sure to please anyone with a taste for pithy buffoonery, moronic misunderstandings, gaffes, and aristocratic slapstick.Contents:\"Leave It to Jeeves\"\"Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest\" \"Jeeves and the Hard-boiled Egg\" \"Absent Treatment\"\"Helping Freddie\"\"Rallying Round Old George\"\"Doing Clarence a Bit of Good\"\"The Aunt and the Sluggard\" MY THOUGHTS: I had, of course, heard of Jeeves, but until I was sick in bed some time ago and had the great fortune to discover the TV series playing, I had never encountered Wodehouse's paragon of virtue. Had Stephen Fry not been playing Jeeves, I probably would have flicked on past. Thankfully I didn't. This is my first encounter with Jeeves off screen, and a thoroughly enjoyable encounter it was. I loved the good natured but bumbling Bertie, and Georgie Pepper, an earlier prototype for Bertie Wooster. The stories simply reinforce a belief of mine that no good deed goes unpunished. British humour at its best. I listened to My Man Jeeves by P. G. Wodehouse, narrated by Simon Pebble, produced by Blackstone Audio, courtesy of OverDrive.

Introduces the reader to the omniscient nature of Jeeves, \"the brains of the establishment\" as Bertie candidly admits. From picking the right clothes to sage advice about betting on the horse races, Jeeves is infallible. And when he's not 100 % successful, as in this opening short story, he can turn defeat into victory by changing the goal posts. The scene of the crime is New York, where Bertie enjoys a self-imposed exile from the censorius eye of aunt Agatha. The plot revolves around my old acquaintance Bruce 'Corky' Corcoran, and touches on such subjects as ornithology, cabaret dancing and portrait painting. 2)  Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest . Bertie is still in New York and is having a fashion disagreement with Jeeves about a pink tie and a Country Gentleman hat, leaving him without sage advice when he becomes babysitter for Wilmot 'Motty' Lord Pershore. His mother describes him as  a vegetarian and a teetotaller and devoted to reading  , but he will prove to be quite the dark horse once out of her censorius eye, and will get into a lot of trouble before Jeeves once more comes to the rescue. 3)  Jeeves and the Hard-Boiled Egg . A hard-boiled egg apparently refers to a person who is the exact opposite of a big spender when it cames to money, and the story deals with the efforts of Bicky Bickersteth to extract some financial support from his uncle, His Grace the Duke of Chiswick. Bertie tries to lend a helping hand, but in the end, the resolution relies once more on Jevees protuding bean. As a bonus we gain helpful business tips about the advantages of chicken farms and their productivity. As the duo continues to reside in New York, the fashion duel between master and valet escalates into moustache territory. 4)  Absent Treatment . The story is told by a new character (for me), Reggie Pepper - a wealthy boulevardier that comes a bit short right after Bertie Wooster, but the tale itself is quite fun. Reggie is trying to help an \"absent\" minded friend, Bobbie Cardew, regain the favor of his young and temporarily 'absent' wife, who is incensed by his carelessness in forgetting such important dates as their wedding anniversary or her birthday. Favorite passage is some good natured poking at the silliness of astrology and zodiac signs interpretation.5)  Helping Freddie . Reggie Pepper is back in the business of helping his friends solve their amorous problems. The old Wodehouse twist of the broken engagement has left Freddie Meadows in the soup, and Reggie's solution is an escape to the seaside in Dorsetshire, where they stumble upon Tootles, a kid with a sweet tooth that may or may not be the solution of Freddie's woes. The story feels unpolished, more like a rehearsal piece for later books than a finished product; still, I recognized a lot of the author's favorite themes.6)  Rallying Round Old George . Reggie Pepper moves to a yacht in Monte Carlo, where he is once again persuaded to give a helping hand to a friend in need. A funny affair concerning an engagement broken in record time (a couple of hours) , a troublesome inheritance, a case of mistaken identity concerning twins and a first class valet whose name is not Jeeves but Voules, himself having troubless with his ladyfriend. Being in Monte Carlo, the story provides also some gambling and some European crowned heads. Again, one of the less stellar efforts from Wodehouse.7)  Doing Clarence a Bit of Good . My favorite Reggie story in this collection, where he falls victim, as Wodehouse charmingly puts it to the \"coolness, the cheek, or if you prefer it, the gall with wich Woman, as a sex, fairly bursts\" . Specifically, after giving the cold shoulder to his engagement proposal and marrying meek artist Clarence Yeardsley, his old flame Elizabeth Shoolbred has no scruples in dragging Reggie to her country residence in order to solve the terrible businness of the Yeardsley 'Venus' . A hilarious mess of stolen paintings, artistic temperaments and persuasive damzels.8)  The Aunt and the Sluggard . The last story brings us back to New York's bubbling night scene, where Bertie Wooster tries to help his recluse poet friend Rockmetteller 'Rocky' Todd convince a wealthy aunt that he is the soul of every party and lives life to the full in the big city. A welcome ocassion for Jeeves to show the more sociable angles of his personality, and for Wodehouse to throw some barbed arrows at modern American poetry. Also an ocassion for Bertie to realise how much he depends on Jeeves for his daily comforts and peace of mind.---At the moment Bertie Wooster is my favorite Wodehouse character, but Jeeves is the perfect counterpart to his scatterbrained and lazy attitude. I love how Bertie insists in every story about Jeeves talent for moving silently: In this matter of shimmering into rooms the chappie is rummy to a degree. You're sitting in the old armchair, thinking of this and that, and then suddenly you look up, and there he is. He moves from point to point with as little uproar as a jelly fish. When he is not shimmering, Jeeves has a tendency to:- trickle- slide- float noiselessly- stream imperceptibly- flow- teleport (Ok, I added the last one, but I'm sure I've missed ten more ways for making an entrance)While I enjoyed these short stories and the New York setting, I feel they lack the depth and the complexity of the full novels featuring Jeeves and Wooster. A common theme in all of the tales is beautifully put by Bertie in one of the opening chapters:  'The older I get, the more I agree with Shakespeare and those poet Johnnies about it always being darkest before the dawn and there's a silver lining and what you lose on the swings you make out on the roundabouts.' or, to paraphrase the Monty Python opus : \"Always look on the bright side of life.\"This may be the secret ingredient that makes me come back to Wodehouse on a regular basis. This and his wild word associations, like this image of 'Corky' Corcoran contemplating breaking the news of his engagement to his tight-fisted uncle: 'The poor chap gave one of those mirthless laughs. He was looking anxious and worried, like a man who has done the murder all right but can't think what the deuce to do with the body' An added bonus in reading  My Man Jeeves  was the pleasure of recognizing the plots from several episodes of the television series featuring Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, mostly from seasons 3 and 4."}, {"userName": "Sarah Grace", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59507807-sarah-grace", "userReview": "4.5 stars.This was awesome.

G. Wodehouse. Four of them are Bertie and Jeeves stories, and four of them are about another character, Reggie Pepper. The Bertie and Jeeves stories are always very formulaic, in that each story involves one of the main character\u2019s friends (or the main character) getting into some sort of scrape, which they then must find some ingenious way to get out of, which inevitably goes horribly, horribly wrong. Many hilarious hi-jinks ensue, but of course somehow everything always falls into place by the end of the story, and the day is saved. The Reggie Pepper stories follow this same theme, sans butler.I wasn\u2019t overly enthralled by the Reggie Pepper stories. They were, as I already mentioned, identical plot-wise to the Bertie and Jeeves stories, but without the benefit of the great character of Jeeves. Admittedly, all of the B&J stories are totally predictable and quite brainless, but they make for good light reading and entertainment. I find that they\u2019re a good bet whenever I\u2019m depressed and/or tired and I just want something to make me laugh and feel good, purely because they are so predictable. No matter what hilarious situations they get into, you know for sure that Jeeves is somehow going to swoop in and make everything alright. They\u2019re much like TV sitcoms in this respect, but in book form (which makes them about eighteen times better than TV sitcoms, of course). I\u2019m currently working on collecting all of the books in this series, but I also plan on branching out and reading more of this author\u2019s other works (of which they seem to have quite a few on Project Gutenberg, which makes me happy cause I\u2019m a cheapskate)."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19481265-tammy", "userReview": "A friend loaned me this book, having read the entire series, and I found it to be very funny and delightful!

My first audio book as well, this was a different experience.The book is complete with all the buffoonery, muddled up scenarios, slapstick wit and wry English humor. A collection of 8 stories - 4 of which featuring Reggie Peppers who seems like the earlier version of Bertie, always trying to help his friends. Reggie Peppers is said to have tried to steal Jeeves by offering twice the salary to add the connect.Needless to say, the Jeeves stories are more endearing. The stories are set in New York, where Bertie is hiding from Aunt Agatha after he failed to prevent his cousin Gussie from marrying a club dancer. Jeeves is more a direct Mr.Fixit in the stories where Bertie is the victim of a good heart. In the last story, Bertie vacates his house to help his friend Rocky keep up a lie to his aunt. The best story featuring Reggie is the one where he helps his friend figure out his angry wife's birthday. Some lovely quotes to go with.

There\u2019s no doubt the man\u2019s right. (\"Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest\")\"Jerome, are you there?\" That\u2019s what I thought after reading the first pages of Wodehouse's My Man Jeeves. Their styles seemed so similar (\"seemed\"; so far, I prefer JKJ). Good writing and a simple plot filled with funny anecdotes that make the book worthwhile. It\u2019s sounds simple but, as I always say, not anybody can be funny. 19th-century people had sense of humor too, naturally (reference to Jerome and others, since Wodehouse is a 20th-century chappie). I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m kind of surprised when I see myself laughing with those guys and just awkwardly smiling while reading the \u201cfunniest guys of the 21st century\u201d. Wodehouse once wrote: \u201cI go in for what is known in the trade as \u2018light writing\u2019 and those who do that \u2013 humorists they are sometimes called \u2013 are looked down upon by the intelligentsia and sneered at.\u201d Sad, odd and true. Some intellectual fellas, snobs or whatever, with Tolstoy in their hands, often reject writers that have the amazing skill of mixing literature and comedy. Forgetting, perhaps, that humor can also be a great resource to analyze human nature. We have literary masterpieces that prove that. Anyway, I wouldn't be able to bear a life of ONLY serious classics. I need both. And when I read about Wodehouse, I knew I had to read his works. This is a collection of short stories about Bertie Wooster (not the smartest guy in town and he's kind of aware of that), Reginald Jeeves, his brilliant valet that always had an answer for everything, and other characters like Mr. Pepper and a lot of chappies... Every story was written with remarkable wit and subtle humor. However, sometimes his humor was so subtle that I didn't know I was reading something intended to be funny. It was entertaining\u2013most of the times; other times, I got lost in a sea of numerous funny-ish details\u2013, but, all in all, it was a good read.I have like a billion more \"Jeeves\" to read. I honestly don't know what my next book is going to be.

I knew Wodehouse was always considered one of the great comedy writers. Two of my favorite authors (Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett) both listed him as an influence to their work. There were plenty of signs that I shouldn't have worried. So why did I? Just a few reasons.- Comedy doesn't generally seem to stand the test of time as well as other genres. I generally don't find older comedy films all that funny. I'll get some flack for this, but I didn't find Animal House funny at all. And while I love Steve Martin, I just don't get The Jerk.- Can a middle-class American guy really relate to the stuffy British aristocrats? Furthermore, how funny can stuffy British Aristocrats be?- I generally don't like short story collections. After reading so many stories, it can become overbearing. I've also found that in short-story collections, you'll find the same story essentially written multiple times, just with different characters and settings.- I'd already heard so many good things, I just didn't think it could live up to it.Well, as it turns out, my apprehensions were unfounded. Wodehouse has been praised for his superior wit, and he deserves it. He is excellent at turns of phrase, and can make some dull subject matter supremely funny. His comedy writing is actually timeless. And his comedy timing is actually writing! His characters Jeeves and Wooster are fantastic.I'd definitely recommend this one to anyone who appreciates comedy. It's very likely a comedian you love has been inspired by Wodehouse, and you can see from where they drew it."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "3.5 starsPretty good set of short humorous stories.This is the first thing I've read by Wodehouse, and from what I can tell from other reviewers, this isn't even his best stuff.

Wodehouse, so why not five stars?Well, here's the scoop. I love Bertie Wooster and Jeeves. One of the most clever duos to have ever graced the printed page. Between Jeeve's restrained resourcefulness and Bertie's self-admitted idiocy, there is a lot of potential for misadventure, and Wodehouse delivers it in droves. Half of the short stories in this volume are Jeeves and Wooster material. The other half is from what I glean as earlier material, with a main character named Reggie Peppers. Now, Peppers is a fore-runner of Wooster, no doubt, but he is a bit of a homunculus, a shadow, a pretender, when compared to the sharp imbecility of Bertie Wooster. Peppers is . . . well, smarter. And more wordy. The clipped down anti-witticisms of Wooster are watered down in Peppers, which leaves the Peppers stories a little wanting. Peppers wants to be Wooster, but doesn't quite get there because, quite frankly, Peppers isn't dumb enough.I am so glad that Wodehouse decided to stick with it and followed through to give life to Bertie Wooster. This isn't to say that Wodehouse missed here. Peppers made an adequate character, but Wooster, with Jeeves as his foil, is pure stupid genius. The Wooster stories in My Man Jeeves bear this out. The merry bungling of Wodehouse's longer works is apparent and the plot lines are as ridiculous and convoluted as one can expect in short fiction (though not as ridiculous and convoluted as his novellas/novels). Five stars for Bertie, negative one star for Peppers.

And Bertie doesn't worry too much about his own intelligence:\nI was stunned by the man's resource. \"It's brain,\" I said; \"pure brain! What do you do to get like that, Jeeves? I believe you must eat a lot of fish, or something.

So we (Me and Iniya) decided to read this book. As we were told that it has many LOL moments, we were expecting it to be high on punch lines and hilarious situations. As soon as I read the first story, I felt a bit low about it. I was expecting the American type of humor, aggressive and ROFL inducing. But it's nothing like it. It's very subtle and a bit underwhelming. I felt like those Johnnies who find themselves thick in a soup and doesn't know what to do :P But as I progressed through this, I began loving the writing, humor and dialogues exponentially. There are many Laugh out Loud situations in this book but they're not coming from the situations but the author's insights about the situations (descriptions, I think is an apt word). And what characters! Bertie Wooster is funny and humble enough to give Jeeves credit to almost everything. I know, I know that Jeeves is the main protagonist but still you have to be a great chappy to do that. Jeeves, you're just awesome! Your ideas and tricks to save your Master are intelligent and funny if not funniest. Wodehouse is one author whose work I've been thinking of reading but never actually did. I'm so glad that I finally gave the chappy a chance. And boy, what a sense of humor! *Dialogue Spoilers * Her name is Anthony. Mary Anthony.  Be! Be! The past is dead. To-morrow is not born. Be to-day! To-day! Be with every nerve, With every muscle, With every drop of your red blood! Be!I loved his way of writing and his ability to generate fun even in routine and ordinary situations.

There's no doubt the man's right.\" And so is our first introduction to Bertie Wooster.Bertie Wooster seems destined to always have Fate sneaking up behind him with a lead pipe. If anything can go wrong for him, it will. Overbearing relatives, friends that need rescuing, ties that don't match the suit he's wearing. Enter Jeeves, his gentleman's gentleman. Calm, cool, and collected, Jeeves is always able to get Bertie and his friends out of whatever scrape they have gotten into. And he's always able to make sure that Bertie is properly attired while doing it. Comis genius is the only description of what goes on in a Jeeves story.This book, Wodehouse's earliest writings about Jeeves, is a set of short stories, several of them about Reggie Pepper, rather than Bertie. The two characters are almost interchangeable except for the absence of Jeeves in the Pepper stories. Some of these stories were rewritten for later Jeeves books.If you've never read P.G. Wodhouse before, his writing is almost hard to describe. He's quintessentially British. He's hilarious and there is plenty of slapstick humour but there is also lots of dry humour. His vocabulary is different than anyone else I've ever read. His use of the slang of the time and his depiction of the idle upper class and the aristocracy before WWII are just fun!

Sadly, My Man Jeeves, whilst perfectly fine, is not amongst his best work. Despite the book\u2019s title, the book is not wall-to-wall Jeeves and Wooster, and half of the stories feature a proto-Bertie Wooster character called Reggie Pepper.

A couple of the stories, \"Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest\u201d and \"The Aunt and the Sluggard\u201d, contain the requisite levels of buffoonery and moronic misunderstandings and are well worth the price of admission, and one of the Reggie Pepper stories, \"Rallying Round Old George\u201d made me chuckle a couple of times.
