Now this picture book isn't Tolkien, but it's just as inspiring! A demanding grasshopper wants a throne that will loom over his followers. Things don't go quite as planned and a tiny bug saves the day, proving that you don't always have to be big and mighty to effect change or find a solution. With bright, fetching pictures and some comic relief, this picture book is sure to please even the pickiest of readers."}, {"userName": "Jillian Heise", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100422-jillian-heise", "userReview": "I adore all of Daniel Miyares' picture books, and this one is reminiscent of my favorite, Pardon Me!. His illustrations are just the best! Bring Me a Rock has a similar feel in the illustrations and story, which is great. This one especially has a message that is important for students to hear about equality and bossiness and kindness and everyone doing the best they are capable of. Definitely one to share with kids."}, {"userName": "Elisabeth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1372331-elisabeth", "userReview": "Great stuff on how even the smallest of us can contribute, as well as cooperation, teamwork, and friendship.

The grasshopper king wants all the insects to bring him large Rocks so he can have a tall pillar above the rest. All in sects bring rocks and he only accepts the really big ones. When a small insect brings him a small one he rejects it. When his pillar is completed, he orders the other insects to lift him on top but his pillar starts to sway from being unbalanced. The little insect brings is rock and wedges it into the pillars to balance it and saves him.I like this book because the images are nice it teaches a lesson, no matter how \"important\" you are you are still equal to others."}, {"userName": "Tasha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929521-tasha", "userReview": "A demanding grasshopper wearing a crown insists that the other insects bring him a rock! Big rocks to build his pedestal so that it is suitable for a king. So the insects bring back rocks and the king accepts most of them with little grace. One though, carried by the smallest insect is not worthy of being part of his pedestal and is rejected along with the little bug who brought it. Now the grasshopper king has created a pedestal to sit high upon with all of the rocks piled one upon another. But it is not balanced and begins to tip. Luckily though, the small pebble that the little bug brought is just right to save the day.Miyares has written this picture book entirely in dialogue and almost all of it in the imperious and demanding voice of the grasshopper. That makes for a great read aloud where storytellers can get into the character and exaggerate it for comic effect. Then the little bug also speaks and in the end equalizes the roles of all of the insects alongside the king. The end is a welcome twist where the kind is on his pedestal but so are all of the other bugs too.The illustrations are done in watercolor and digital resulting in a book that is filled with light and lush greens. The grasshopper and the other insects are colorful against the yellow sky and greenery and the critical pebble glows white on the page, immediately showing its importance even before it is used.Read this one aloud with plenty of energy and dynamics and it will add plenty of zing to any summer story time. Appropriate for ages 2-5."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1380067-samantha", "userReview": "A dictator-like grasshopper commands the other insects to bring him big rocks so he can construct a majestic pedestal. Most rocks pass the test, but when a very small bug presents a pebble the grasshopper is quick to cut him down. Later, when the grasshopper's pedestal reveals its weakness and puts his life in danger, the small bug's pebble becomes incredibly useful. Humbled, the grasshopper asks how he can ever repay the bug for its kindness and the small bug devises a way for all of the bugs to feel elevated, but equal. The story is reminiscent of Yertle the Turtle by Seuss and is supported by vibrant digital watercolor artwork. Great read aloud with an important message about kindness and equality for PreK-2."}, {"userName": "Maggie Mattmiller", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19488785-maggie-mattmiller", "userReview": "Torn between 3 and 4 stars on this one. I think there is a GREAT lesson hidden in this one, but I do think kids might need adult help unlocking it. Definitely a book I would love to have in my classroom, as I would lead the discussion and could start some great conversation among my students. I think kids could for sure enjoy the book without adult support, but I do think adults might be required to get the full benefit. There are lessons to be found in helping others, regardless of how they have treated you, and of treating everyone as equals. Could surely get some good conversation from this one. Will have to add it to my classroom library!"}, {"userName": "Heidi-Marie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/921817-heidi-marie", "userReview": "Another lesson in politeness and kindness by Miyares, with even a touch of repentance and forgiveness, as well as ingenuity.

PICTURE BOOK. Books For Young Readers (Simon & Schuster), 2016 $17.99. The Grasshopper King wants a throne built and commands all the other bugs to bring him the largest rocks they can carry. As the smallest bug approaches with only a little pebble he is disdainfully rebuked. After erecting his throne of rocks the grasshopper sits atop his seat but soon discovers it is precariously unbalanced. The small bug comes to the rescue by bringing back his little pebble to secure the grasshopper's perch. The moral of the story is great in that even the smallest bug can make a big difference. However, this wasn't my favorite tale. The pictures are cute and the text is very simple so it would be good for beginning readers, but I didn't like the tone of the book.

It's a great example of underestimating children's minds and using a very superficial understanding of morality to craft a \"nice message\" that's actually kind of toxic. At best, kids don't like that sort of thing because they're children, not idiots, and find cheesy fake stuff to be cheesy and fake. At worst, this might endorse abusive dynamics and a harmful misunderstanding of capitalism.But it's a kids' book, not likely to be seen by too many eyes, and getting into all that seems mean spirited. The art is cute at times, and anyone is welcome to enjoy it with my compliments. Unless someone like-minded comes along who wants to unpack it in the comments, I'll leave it at that for now."}, {"userName": "Beth Pofahl", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13237206-beth-pofahl", "userReview": "Recently, I'm intrigued by Daniel Miyares' work.
