This book was disturbing and horrifying, just the way I seem to like them. While it kept my attention throughout, I had to read this in pieces as I wanted to pace myself on the graphic details and content matter. I loved the character of DI Kim Stone. This plot was complex and layered like an onion; as I kept reading I kept peeling away new levels to the individual case and to what I assume is part of the continuing storyline. I always enjoy a strong, female detective and this book did not disappoint. I would highly recommend to those with a strong stomach and do not have trouble sleeping at night. This hit all the feels for me with subject matter close to my heart, as our family and extended family are adopted and came from situations very similar to those described in Silent Scream. I found myself close to tears multiple times. The story was complex but in the best way possible as it was fairly easy to follow and only added to the greatness of the story. I'm excited to follow DI Stone and her team on to Evil Games!"}, {"userName": "Frances", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37439004-frances", "userReview": "Angela Marsons has produced a complex mystery thriller with many unique and distinctive characters. We are soon introduced to Detective Inspector Kim Stone who has no ability to hide her feelings. She demonstrates persistent stubbornness, is extremely pushy, and barks orders to her team expecting them to jump straight away. When a female has been found dead in a bathtub, it\u2019s just the beginning of baffling murders all taking place within a short period. As each victim is assessed, Stone\u2019s team finds one thing in common; they had been employed at a children\u2019s home now empty and abandoned. Angela Marsons has received high praise for her novel which is first in a series. No doubt many readers will continue to follow this fine author."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26175098-christine", "userReview": "This is just an unbelievable debut thriller by British author Angela Marsons. Her book reads as if she has been writing best sellers for years. The action as well as the intrigue starts up immediately. And I mean immediately, as in the prologue! Eventually we are dealt several murders occurring both 10 years previous and in the present. We are gradually introduced to a large cast of characters, all fleshed out to some extent making it easy to keep them straight. The protagonist, DI Kim Stone, has had an extremely hard upbringing. She is left with scars, including minimal social skills, yet she has a deep burning desire to come to the aid of suffering innocents. Her zeal in this respect is somewhat uncontrolled which pretty much keeps her in the doghouse with her superiors. On the other hand, her team members have a deep respect for her and are extremely loyal and protective towards her. Kim is damaged and her past is fed to us in small doses as the story of her challenge to solve the murders progresses. I found myself intensely caring and rooting for her.Ms. Marsons does a wonderful job, not only with the protagonist, but the supporting characters, both good and bad. We are able to get into their heads, which to me always enriches a tale. I also found the characters to be believable. I particularly liked the close (but nonromantic) relationship between Kim and her partner Bryant.There is a sinister air that pervades the book creating unrelenting tension for the reader. Twists and turns abound as the deliciously complex plot unfolds. There are 3 instances in the novel (chapter 20, chapter 66 and one other section) that actually gave me chills and goosebumps, they were so terrifyingly sick. As the story progressed, my interest did not flag for one moment, and the last 15% of the book was crazy good! Even at 96%, I was asking myself \u201cwhat the hell is going on?\u201d You will just have to experience it yourself to appreciate it. I highly recommend Silent Scream to all thriller fans. This is one not to be missed. It will easily make my list of top 10 books of 2015. I have my eye out for the second book (Evil Games) in what I suspect will be an outstanding series."}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra", "userReview": "\"Teresa Wyatt had the inexplicable feeling that this night would be her last.\"Chills! I was hooked after reading that sentence! I don't want to say too much about this book as I feel it is best to go into this book not knowing too much about plot. The brief synopsis is that human remains have been found at a former children's home. Through the course of the investigation, it becomes clear that the human remains may be connected to recent murders. But how? Why? Plus, young women/teens from the children's home disappeared ten years ago. What's the connection?Lots of questions went through my mind while I was reading this: Who is the current killer? What is his/her motivation? Is this the same person responsible for the remains found at the children's home? Is there more than one killer? Whose body was found at the children's home? D.I. Kim Stone is on the case and the reader knows early on that she has demons in her past. Maybe it is just me, but has anyone else noticed the trend to have female investigators have troubled pasts? Or perhaps, maybe it is just coincidence that my book choices have contained these types of characters. hmmmmThis is a book that had an I-did-not-see-that-coming moment in it!!!! The reveal was, well, REVEALING! Seriously, I was shocked, and I love when a book can shock me and yet have that shock be believable and make sense. Whew! Plus, I really enjoyed how the book went back and forth in time. Giving the reader glimpses into the past and back into the present investigation. The changes in location and time flow very nicely and really help move the plot along and keep things interesting. This is the first book in the series and the first book I have read by this author and it will not be my last.There might be some scenes in this book which may be disturbing to some readers. This book also deals with subject matter which may make some uncomfortable. I don't want to give any spoilers, but I am happy to answer any questions as to what the subject matter may be.Read more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Kaceey - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13442817-kaceey---traveling-sister", "userReview": "A traveling sister read with my 2 favorite Canadian sisters (Norma and Brenda)!A wonderful start to a very successful series from Angela Marsons.

I've lined all the rest up like jagged stepping stones. They are beckoning to me.This is heavy-weight subject matter presented here, but it is Angela Marsons driving the bus. She will lay it all out on the table without the overkill of muck and mire seeping into your socks. You get it. You know the depth to which the human mind can transcend. This is Marsons' debut novel, but you already feel the vibration of something grand about to happen from the first page onward.DI Kim Stone is called in when the body of a headmistress is found under the water of her bathtub. No casual bubblebath here. Someone has also set fire to the front of the building to tidy up any loose strings that may lead to the killer. And this killer possesses all the quick steps to stay ahead of Stone. More bodies turn up. But this killer has never taken into account that Stone can make connections like a bloodhound on steroids. Angela Marsons ensures that the reader is totally engaged.Kim Stone, herself, is a product of a children's home gone wrong, wrong. Her antennae jets out when things just don't jive. That's why this debut novel removes any doubt of what has previously transpired in Stone's life. \"It was the way she always handled things. The bad things were packed away in boxes and sealed shut.\"There is more to Kim Stone than just perusing the surface. She definitely has staying power to which the next books in this series will contribute to. I highly recommend Angela Marsons and her stellar writing ability. The insertions of the killer's reflections is like a pinwheel that keeps spinning and spinning, blurring things at first, but bringing a creep-filled closing at the end."}, {"userName": "Luffy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407364-luffy", "userReview": "In part this book's series of crimes reminds me of Agatha Christie's ABC Murders.

Will Detective Kim Stone solve the murder and stop a sicko from perpetrating a myriad of cruel misdeeds?See, this is the type of book that embrace their cliches and try to subvert those cliches to commit to paper a breathtaking story that will come out smelling of roses when drawn in comparison to its competitors. This is the first series written by Angela Marsons. She is very prolific,so let's hope the quality in her first book stays the same in their sequels."}, {"userName": "Maxine (Booklover Catlady)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22943325-maxine-booklover-catlady", "userReview": "I sucked up every word of this brilliant novel, it intrigued me from the word go. I love it when I get a book that I can get lost in and read in one sitting, this was one of those. It's a good start to 2015 for this crime loving book lover and reviewer!Many crime novels are a bit same-same if you know what I mean, it's kind of hard to add elements that make it stand out from the rest on the shelves. Where I think Angela Marsons managed to do this is with her intense characters, especially Detective Inspector Kim Stone. SO well done!D.I. Kim Stone is not only a dedicated and passionate police officer but her character in the book is so fantastically deep and memorable. It was easy to feel along with her, think along with her and just really, really like her. I think she is one of my favourite new crime leading ladies I have come across for a while. Some of the emotion coming off her in this book was tangible. A very well written character. Even the darkest secrets can\u2019t stay buried forever\u2026Five figures gather round a shallow grave. They had all taken turns to dig. An adult-sized hole would have taken longer. An innocent life had been taken but the pact had been made. Their secrets would be buried, bound in blood \u2026Years later, a headmistress is found brutally strangled, the first in a spate of gruesome murders which shock the Black Country.But when human remains are discovered at a former children\u2019s home, disturbing secrets are also unearthed. D.I. Kim Stone fast realises she\u2019s on the hunt for a twisted individual whose killing spree spans decades.As the body count rises, Kim needs to stop the murderer before they strike again. But to catch the killer, can Kim confront the demons of her own past before it\u2019s too late?The plot is brilliant in this novel. It surprised me with the direction it took and the sheer emotion behind it all. This is much more than just another crime novel, it's tackles issues that can really make you feel very uncomfortable. I am a hardened crime and horror reader, so hardened to difficult and gory moments, yet scenes in this book, whilst not graphic still disturbed me hugely. This was mainly because of the way the author portrays the viewpoint of the killer/s. How he/she sees the victim. It left me angry, saddened and all sorts of other feelings. Pretty much the same as Kim Stone is feeling. I was right with her in wanting to catch the bad guys let me tell you. As more and more bodies are uncovered the book just gets better and better, like a busy train intersection, all the story lines and people in the book come together neatly at the end to give you the conclusion you have been begging for as you read along. Now when did a crime novel ever reduce me to tears? Let me think..umm....umm...never. But there is a particular scene in this book that is so touching, such an outstanding piece of written fiction that contains so much human emotion and dignity that I had a little tear in my eye. Essentially this book stirred a lot up in me. The pace is enjoyable, straight into the action and it doesn't slow down or let you go. One of those books where I worked out some of the answers but not all, so very satisfied. A fantastic read that I really recommend whether you are a crime lover or not. I will be looking out for more writing from Angela Marsons for sure.Five easy stars for Silent Scream. This one would make a great movie.

Many thanks to Netgalley and Bookouture.All I can say is that this crime novel, \u201cSilent Scream\u201d by Angela Marsons was amazing, and I was very surprised to see that this was her debut novel. As an avid reader of crime, suspense , mystery, psychological thrillers, I will say that this is the BEST novel in this category that I have read this year.

Then, human remains are found on the grounds of a former children\u2019s home, Crestwood, and then D. I.

They bloody well mattered to her.\"In this very dark and atmospheric police procedural, the author has done a fantastic job of creating characters that are real and totally believable, with all their faults and merits. We can totally relate to Kim, and we are drawn further into the story. I love the way Kim's own past is revealed over the course of the book, information is disclosed on a need to know basis.

And it was excellent.I took to the main character, Detective Kim Stone, immediately. She is feisty and smart and never lets anyone score a point over her. Her offsider, D.S. Bryant, is her perfect foil. I enjoyed their friendly dialogue especially since there is no romance involved to mess things up!The mystery is good and ends up quite convoluted as they seek not just a murderer from the present but also one from the past. The final solution is very cleverly done and totally unexpected. I especially enjoyed all the police work and forensics.Definitely a page turner and an excellent first outing for Kim and her crew.

DI Kim Stone and her team are investigating the bathtub drowning of a headmistress. Almost immediately, a man is murdered in his home. Both victims were previously employees at Crestwood, a children's home which is now abandoned. I like that the mystery manages to combine the current plot while providing a way for us to learn about Kim\u2019s backstory. Kim herself had spent time at Crestwood. But it's the time with her fourth foster family that will bring tears to your eyes. As I found with the later books, Marsons has a great style that quickly engages the reader. This story grabs you quickly and doesn't let you go. Each of the team members is well developed and I love how they all interact. Even Woody, her boss, is well drawn. I especially like that Bryant and Kim can be just friends with no romantic tension. Kim is a great character. Brash, strong willed, she's constantly in trouble with her superiors because she is so focused on finding the truth. \u201cDammit, Stone.

Stone #) by Angela Marsons is a 2015 Bookouture publication. I noticed this series was very popular on Goodreads, so naturally, I had to see why everyone was so keen on it\u2026 well now I know!This British thriller is, believe or not, a debut novel! So, I am doubly impressed by how well the plot is crafted, with the well timed pacing, and how the author made this jaded reader gasp out loud on more than one occasion. When a headmistress is murdered and it is discovered she had ties to an old children\u2019s home where a body has been unearthed, it is D.I. Kim Stone\u2019s job to determine how the crimes are connected. But, the body count just keeps piling up, however, unbeknownst to Kim, someone is watching her investigation very closely and if she gets too close to the truth, she could be the next murder victim. I loved D.I. Stone right from the beginning. It\u2019s not a matter of knowing when to turn her filter on or off, it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t seem to have a filter. So, what you see, is what you get with her\u2026 at least most of the time. Her sidekick, Bryant, is perhaps her closest friend, and he helps to soften her rough edges a bit. The secondary characters on the force are still shoved a little too far into the background to get a true reading of them, but I\u2019m sure their personalities will flesh out as we go along. The crime drama is certainly not for the faint of heart. There is no shortage of graphic violence, and the set up is particularly disturbing, but don't let that distract you, because the psychological aspects are where the real scary stuff is.  The author does a nice job of luring the reader into the next chapter, not just by teasing you, or tossing out tantalizing bait, but by dropping a bombshell on you, guaranteeing you will have to read the next chapter, and the next\u2026 so, be forewarned, you may lose a little sleep before you get the end of this one. The thriller was already above average from the start, with jaw dropping twists, and a furiously frustrating mystery that I simply could not puzzle out. But, the finale, blindsided me, really, really taking me by surprise, and left me flabbergasted and speechless. This doesn\u2019t happen to me all that often, so it goes without saying, that I am definitely on board for book two, and can\u2019t wait to see how this series shapes up. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Zoeytron", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron", "userReview": "Is the fear of getting caught what really masquerades as a person's conscience?D.I.

You can rest assured of one thing \u2013 she is relentless and will not stop until she puts the pieces together. You want Kim Stone in your corner, along with her excellent investigative team.

How did they fit into the story and when were they introduced? So then things started to go a little slow for us however when the action picked up and the boat started rocking we could not put this novel down. It felt like the calm before the storm for us. DI Kim Stone is a fascinating and feisty female character with a wicked sense of humour and a soft side to her that we all absolutely loved. We loved the glimpses into her past and felt heartbroken by her childhood memories. Allowing us to see the vulnerable side of her. ANGELA MARSONS delivers a complex and layered story here that is cleverly written in such a skillful way that allowed us to really get into the unique and distinctive characters and the storyline. There is little snippets throughout, at just the right time, giving us a glimpse into the killer\u2019s creepy motives adding some tension to the story for us. The confusion with the characters and the slow start threw Kaceey off her game and she never saw the twists coming. Norma simply had a hard time getting her groove back after not reading much on vacation and was also stumped and felt like the author offered all those distractions early on to confuse her. Actually quite clever! We all thought we had it figured out only to find out we didn't. Brenda is always off her game when it comes to thrillers and was so excited that she figured something out only to find out she didn\u2019t. We all had a good laugh over this.In amongst some darkness with subjects like abuse and neglect there is light with kindness from some of the characters that had us loving them even more. Angela Marsons sure has left us wanting more and we are ready to dive into book two of this series very soon. We can\u2019t wait to see what's in store for DI Kim Stone next. Highly recommended!

I know it might feel clich\u00e9 to have a tormented detective as the main character, but I ate it up!Just a heads up about this series. The subject matter is dark and it\u2019s hard to read at times due to the violence of the crimes and how evil the suspects are. I\u2019ve read lots of crime detective series over the years and I was still a bit sad and horrified by this case.I think it\u2019s a great writing skill of Marsons. She can write realistically about what a detective would see and experience. Doing this type of job is not a walk in the park and she relates this so well!The book starts off with a group of people gathered around a shallow grave. Who\u2019s in the grave and what type of secrets are these people protecting? One of the people standing at the grave is murdered in the first part of this book. From there, the book just keeps picking up steam.Don\u2019t hope to get anything done in the next few days because I binge read this due to short chapters, addicting material and a suspenseful plot!If I\u2019m ever in a book slump, I now know that I can just pick up a book from the D.I. Kim Stone series and I\u2019ll be good to go!Well done Marsons!

A woman has been found murdered in a bathtub and the murder seems to be linked to a body that is discovered a little while later buried at a former children\u2019s home. Kim Stone and her team must figure out who is behind the killing and why before more people die.I had some trouble getting into the story, mostly because I felt a bit weary when the cops were introduced, they seem to be the usual bunch, a wish cracker, best friend, and the technical one (well surfing FB and finding clues in emails) and the gruff boss. Also, Kim Stone, the main character is a woman with a dark past in foster homes, she doesn't obey orders and has an attitude problem. And, Kim is one of my main problems with this book. The thing with orders and regulations is something that is there for everyone and every time she does something wrong in this book she is called in to see her boss, but she doesn't get suspended or taken off the case. I'm sorry, no matter how good you are as a cop. you have to obey orders. I'm having a hard time seeing how this would work in the real world. And then towards to end when she breaks into the former children\u2019s home to look for something, All ALONE at night. Come on. She doesn't tell anyone and she goes by herself. There is a killer loose, but who cares, let's play recklessly. Another thing that bothered me was how convenient everything was:1. We have a former children\u2019s home. Kim was a foster home child and has spent time in children's home. 2. There are two sisters in the story, they are twins. Kim was a twin. 3. Someone is mentally ill. Kim's mother is mentally ill. So of course, this makes her the perfect cop to solve the crimes! Also, we have a killer that decided that Kim is the perfect adversary. That's new, never happens in books...To the plus side. I had problems getting into the story, that's true, but it got better around 50% into the story. Things started to happen and the story got more intense. Also, I was totally blindsided when it came to the ending of the book. And, despite the fact that the cops felt a bit stereotypical. I did come to like them, including Kim. I just hope that next case hasn't any similarities with her life."}, {"userName": "*Avonna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5428424-avonna", "userReview": "There are great reviews written by my friends about this book already.

I found her as unpleasant because she\u2019s too fake. She seems coming out of a recipe: 1 cup of rhetoric, mixing it with 1 cup of defiance, some pseudo-humor, a teaspoon of immaturity\u2026 and there you go! These things could be a good cocktail, but if you make the cocktail without skills, you could throw it up just like it happened to me. A very fake character, without even a bit of genuineness. At least, this is how I saw her. And about suspense too: zero, due to the same reason. Never a doubt or hesitation. Always great eureka moments! The killer\u2019s \u201cconfessions\u201d seem to be in the book just to prove that Kim is always right (which mean, the author gives us all the pieces of the puzzle and she also puts them together. So, what am I supposed to do? Look at you while you enjoy the game? I never felt involved in the story because of the way she tells it.)I found the dialogs very boring and annoying.I gave 2 stars instead of 1 just because Anatomy and Archeology are treated very well. And also Beth and Nicole\u2019s story, especially in the last chapters: I was fascinated by it and I clap my hands. But it\u2019s too little, because the story is told in a too simple way. The Author says to us whatever she made up through the characters\u2019 talks: this could be ok at a theater or in a movie, but I think that, in a book, it\u2019s just coarseness and incompetence. A writer is supposed to find a way to lead the reader to understand what\u2019s going on without telling them. Too easy let the characters tell it. Everybody can do that. Perhaps that\u2019s why we have more writers than readers\u2026 The excitement in a thriller is to gradually get at a conclusion, it\u2019s to monitor the detective\u2019s deductions, it\u2019s to see how a clue or idea become a lead. If you don\u2019t show all of this, but you just give me the conclusion (because the detective deduces things outside the book), how can I feel the story? It\u2019s like taking a cooking class where they give you cooked food instead of teaching you how to cook it.It\u2019s a story full of stretches, unlikely things that only happen because the Author wants to. Passing on the ways the murders happen (it would be like to shoot the Red Cross), how is it possible that the detectives never make a single hypothesis about who the killer is along the all book? Not a single \u201cSo, who do you think could be?\u201d Nope. They keep investigating around, picking clues and evidence like they\u2019re buying stuff at a grocery store, and eventually they directly find the solution. It\u2019s like all the characters shamelessly follow the Pied Piper (the Author)I recommend this book to those who only want to eat. I don\u2019t recommend it to those who want to cook too.ITALIANOCi\u00f2 che non mi \u00e8 piaciuto per niente di questo libro \u00e8 la protagonista. L\u2019ho trovata un personaggio sgradevole e fasullo. Sembra il frutto di una ricetta: prendi 200 grammi di moralismo, lo mescoli con mezzo litro di spirito ribelle, un pizzico di pseudo-humor, una spruzzata di immaturit\u00e0\u2026 e voil\u00e0! Queste caratteristiche possono essere un cocktail vincente, ma se il cocktail \u00e8 preparato senza arte, magari uno lo vomita come \u00e8 successo a me. Un personaggio finto al cubo, senza mai un sussulto di genuinit\u00e0. Antipatica in tutto quello che pensa, dice e fa. Almeno questo \u00e8 l\u2019effetto che ha fatto a me. E pure la suspense: zero, per lo stesso motivo. Mai un dubbio, mai un\u2019esitazione. Sempre intuiti formidabili. Le \u201cconfessioni\u201d dell\u2019assassino sembrano buttate l\u00ec giusto per confermare che Kim ci azzecca sempre (in altre parole, l\u2019autrice fornisce tutti i pezzi del puzzle e li mette pure insieme. E io guardo, senza mai sentirmi coinvolto visto che fa tutto lei.)Anche la scrittura, di basso livello. Non so nella versione inglese, ma in quella italiana avr\u00f2 contato almeno 15 scoppi di risate. Imbarazzante e fastidioso. Dialoghi da orticaria. Ho dato due stelle invece di una solo perch\u00e9 anatomia e archeologia sono trattati con competenza ben dosata. E anche per la storia di Beth e Nicole, soprattutto negli ultimi capitoli: questo mi ha affascinato davvero e faccio i miei complimenti. Tuttavia \u00e8 troppo poco, perch\u00e9 poi la storia \u00e8 narrata in maniera veramente elementare, con l\u2019autrice che si limita a dire al lettore tutto quello che ha architettato per bocca dei personaggi: questo potrebbe andar bene in teatro o in un film, ma in un libro \u00e8 a parer mio sintomo di grossolanit\u00e0 e imperizia. In un libro si deve trovare il modo di condurre il lettore a capire quello che lo scrittore ha in mente. Dirglielo per bocca dei personaggi \u00e8 troppo semplice. Sono buoni tutti. Forse perci\u00f2 ci sono pi\u00f9 scrittori che lettori\u2026 Il fascino di un thriller sta nell\u2019arrivare gradualmente a una conclusione, sta nel seguire passo per passo i ragionamenti dei detective, sta nel vedere come un indizio o un\u2019intuizione si evolvano portando a una pista. Se tutto ci\u00f2 non viene mostrato, ma ci viene servita la conclusione bell\u2019e pronta (perch\u00e9 la detective ha ragionato al di fuori del libro), come faccio ad appassionarmi? \u00c8 come seguire un corso di cucina dove invece di insegnarti a preparare una pietanza, te la servono bell\u2019e fatta. Resta una storia piena di forzature, cose improbabili che accadono solo per volont\u00e0 dell\u2019autrice. Tralasciando le modalit\u00e0 di quasi tutti i delitti (sarebbe come sparare sulla Croce Rossa), ma possibile che per l\u2019intero libro Kim e i suoi collaboratori non formulino mai uno straccio di ipotesi su chi possa essere il killer? Mai un \u201cSecondo te chi \u00e8 stato?\u201d. No. Loro investigano a destra e a manca, raccogliendo prove e indizi nemmeno stessero facendo la spesa, per poi arrivare direttamente alla soluzione. \u00c8 come se tutti i personaggi seguissero il piffero magico suonato dall\u2019autrice. Consigliato a chi vuole solo mangiare. Sconsigliato per chi vuole anche cucinare."}, {"userName": "Veronica ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7035111-veronica", "userReview": "I'd heard quite a few good things about this book so I went into it with some caution. I've been burned by high praise in the past, you see. In this case, at least, the praise was well earned. This is a well plotted and paced mystery set in the Black Country area (with which I have at least some historical familiarity thanks to Peaky Blinders) . There are contemporary murders to be solved so D.I. Kim Stone and her team are called in to investigate. When they find ties to even older murders things really start to get interesting. I wasn't quite sure what to think of D.I. Kim Stone initially. She comes from that long line of literary law enforcement characters who are antagonistic sometimes just for the sake of it, who buck authority and operate on the theory that it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission, who basically charge ahead as if their supervisors don't even exist and yet never get more than an arched eyebrow and a wagging finger with orders to never-do-that-again when everyone and their dog knows full well that they will do it again. I always wonder how all the other employees must feel when they are held to one standard and the maverick MC gets to flout all the rules, procedures, and direct orders. And, just like all those other characters, she carries some extremely heavy baggage courtesy of a traumatic backstory. But, I digress. Suffice it to say that Kim Stone is cut from that very same trope-heavy cloth and so I started this book with a here-we-go-again mindset regarding her characterization. But hey, at least she's not an alcoholic! Moving on, Kim's baggage personal history means that this current case hits close to home. We get small looks into her past in dribs and drabs throughout the book and while I think there's definitely more to discover, what is disclosed is pretty damn awful. As the story progresses, we're shown more sides to Kim than just the prickly one she shows to most of her professional peers. I liked her a bit more by the end, though this was helped along by her interactions with Bryant, a member of her team and the closest thing she has to a friend. Bryant is older and, by all accounts, happily married so this looks to be a strictly platonic relationship interwoven with strong feelings of personal friendship. That suits me fine. Stacy and Dawson round out Kim's team and the dynamics between the four team members were great. I hope we get to see Kim's role in the camaraderie grow as the series goes on. The mysteries, both old and new, were interesting and complex. I guessed at some things correctly but found myself completely surprised by others. The story also offers some chilly insight into the POV of the killer and it was disturbing and twisted to say the least. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator did a fine job with all the voices and imbued the killer's POV with a deadness that fit that twisted psyche perfectly. I'm looking forward to reading more in the series."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "So these days one of my very favourite things to do is try out new Crime fiction. I especially like it if it is the start of a series. And I like it even MORE when you get one as good as this and know that you will probably have many happy reading experiences ahead of you.In \u201cSilent Scream\u201d we meet Kim, Detective and a bit of a loner, for good reason. She is a brilliant character, flawed as it seems detectives need to be but in a way that makes her very intriguing. When a brutal murder is discovered she finds herself caught up in a case that has its roots in the past and uncovers a killer who has remained hidden for decades.The main thing for me, with crime fiction, especially when it is a series, is that our main \u201ccore\u201d characters are both interesting enough that you want them to appear in further novels, but enough in the background that the story is not all about them. The yin/yang of detective fiction if you like and Angela Marsons has pulled this off extremely well. Kim and her team are all a terrific mix, we learn plenty about them but not too much and there is huge potential for the future. So that is a real plus.The second thing of course is that the mystery element is intelligent, addictive and well flowing, with enough twists and turns to make it thrilling \u2013 again this is done extremely well here, it is a very dark tale at its heart and is highly addictive. It also has an emotionally resonant core that is extremely compelling.Overall a really really good addition to the Crime fiction genre, I look forward to seeing what is next for Kim and co.Happy Reading Folks!"}, {"userName": "sue", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377874-sue", "userReview": "First of all, let me say how I loved the cover, it was very apt for the books story line.How I loved DI Kim Stone, I found her focused, dedicated, harsh for good reasons at times and a quirky sense of humor at times which came out now and again in her working relationships with ones she had to rub alongside of.What first appeared to be a sort of straight forward case lead into deeper and darker minefields which I loved.Each person that was attached to the case was very real in my minds eye, so too when more were extended on as the field widened for the killer.DI Kim Stone seems to not care or concern herself as to how people perceive her, what she DOES care about are her victims, and finding out the TRUTH. This is a story of VERY DARK SECRETS where only a handful of people knew. Secrets have a way of coming out though, maybe not soon, but sooner than later, and this is what is revealing and unraveling in this wonderful thriller that Angela Marsons has written and orchestrated. I use the work \"orchestrated\" because like a good tune being played by a band it has to have good timing, good acoustics to name but a few things and ALL parts have to play they're individual part to make up a good piece of music for us all to enjoy, so to with this thriller, everyone played their part, and the CLIMAX was brilliant, absolutely BRILLIANT.This author has a good clear pathway into the Thriller Genre along with some top rated best sellers.I will definitely be stalking her, keeping a close eye on her books.

The storyline is multi-layered and that's what gives this book the edge. There's a complex story which is rooted in terrible crimes against girls/children in the past, which took place at a Children's Home. Then there are murders in the present and present day conspiracy. Wow. The solving of the crime in the past was well done by the author but what made it great was the solving of the crimes in the present - that came as a fantastic twist. My only negatives in this book were the 'coincidences' which were, at times, a bit difficult to swallow - Kim was brought up in a Children's Home, Kim was a twin and there is a twin main character in the story. Plus Kim seems to be the only police officer with any intelligence. Also, it was a quick read, which, for me, is not always a good sign.
