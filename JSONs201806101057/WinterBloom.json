Tara Heavey tells the story of five people who work together toward a common goal and discover much about themselves and each other along the way. When young widowed mother Eva Madigan spies the sadly neglected walled garden of the elderly Mrs. Prendergast, she is struck by the desire to restore the wasted space to its former glory. It takes some convincing, and Mrs. Prendergast warns her that the garden is meant to be sold, but Eva is given permission for her project. She places an ad at the grocer for help with a community garden, and only two people respond to the ad: Uri, a distinguished older gentleman, and Emily, the clerk from the grocer. Soon they are joined by Uri's son Seth, and after a time, even Mrs. Prendergast begins to help with the work. Each of the gardeners has been touched by tragedy, and their individual stories are woven throughout the telling of the restoration. Uri, a tailor by trade, was taught much by his own father, who was a master gardener. Seth, who inherited his love of cultivating the soil from his father and grandfather, has his own landscaping business. Emily, stuck in her clerk's job, longs to further her education and move on with her life. Mrs. Prendergast, a lady of impeccable social grace, is nonetheless rumored to have killed her husband and buried him somewhere in the garden. It is her greedy, needy son, Lance, who is pressuring her to sell the land. Eva's husband took their baby daughter for a drive to settle her crying, and they were both killed in a terrible accident. Eva was left to care for their young son, Liam, and to manage her survivor guilt. These are remarkable people, trying their best to live \"ordinary\" lives. I was touched by their heartaches, and I celebrated with them their joys. Their shared experience was an affirmation of life, not only for the characters, but also for the reader. I will definitely read more work by the wonderful storyteller, Tara Heavey!Review Copy Gratis Simon & Schuster"}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4103400-maria", "userReview": "What I Can Tell You:This was a fantastic book. Tara Heavey did an excellent job on character development and storyline. In this moving story of hardship, friendship, past mistakes, haunting childhoods and courage and determination.The character of Eva was my favorite. She has suffered loss and through her determination and courage she undertakes a project that brings the most different people together. Creating a small community of misfits and personalities. From the first paragraph you are invested. The cover does nothing for the book as is appears very light but with the loss of a child, the Holocaust, hidden pregnancy this book is far from light. It is more a winding path through life's hardships toward renewal and growth.Fantastic book and I give it a 5."}, {"userName": "Amy (The Reading Nook)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53075848-amy-the-reading-nook", "userReview": "I could not put this book down!!!!

For more reasons than most she struggles every day to move forward and often her only motivation rests with her young son Liam. With not much to push her forward, when Eva happens upon an abandoned \u201csecret garden\u201d her heart warms at the idea of a blossoming paradise in the midst of a bustling city. With the addition of a few helpers, Seth, Uri, Emily and Mrs. Prendergast, Eva begins again. Each person that helps with the garden holds a secret past, and as the story evolves the garden becomes a symbol of the change that each must go through to overcome and triumph.This was truly a delightful story. It\u2019s been some time since I finished it, but even now I often find myself thinking of the stories behind each of these wonderful characters. I\u2019ve actually tried singling out a favorite character from the story and it seems almost impossible. Eva-the single mother, Seth-the single recently divorced father, Emily-the college student with a troubled past, Uri-a mild mannered elderly man, and Mrs. Prendergast-the garden owner each hold their own in this dynamic novel. Throughout the story you get to hear from the majority of the characters, learn about their individual pasts and eventually how they help each other, along with the help of the garden to overcome their struggles.It\u2019s also quite difficult to discuss Winter Bloom without giving away too much of the story. Heavey weaves each of the characters so tightly into the story that it\u2019s not until nearly half way through the book that you know many of their individual troubles. It\u2019s quite wonderful though, because though you don\u2019t know their concerns to begin with you are still able to connect with each because the writing is so good. This was actually my first novel by Tara Heavey and I\u2019m eager to check out her British Chick Lit books because of it.For me, I obviously connected the most with Eva\u2019s character. A single mother with a young child about the same age as my own son. Her concerns about him when he\u2019s no where in site is something I struggle with constantly. Not only that, but her extreme situation is something I\u2019ve long feared. Though I\u2019ve never (and don\u2019t plan to) had an affair and my husband and children are still living (thankfully), it\u2019s difficult to care for people so much that you don\u2019t allow it to consume you. I could truly connect with her concerns about losing her only remaining family member. It was an interesting process to see how she handled the circumstances surrounding the loss of her husband. As was the process that Emily went through in coming to terms with her parents and the truth of her own situation.As I said, Winter Bloom is a difficult book to discuss without giving too much of it away or rambling on for pages. Beautifully written, I have no doubt that within the first few pages whomever reads it will be consumed by the stories of the individual characters as well as the ultimate outcome of their beloved garden. A story about change, triumphing over your past and letting go of those things that stand in our way. A beautiful story that will move many to possibly evaluate their own relationships and possibly start a garden of their very own."}, {"userName": "Carla Ford", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2472067-carla-ford", "userReview": "This book is absolutely on my short list of the year's best! As five people come together to transform an overgrown garden, they each bring their pasts, their pain, and their hopes for the future. Eva - single with a son to raise, Emily, struggling with her solitary secret, Uri and Seth, father and son, each with his own painful past, and finally Mrs, Pendergast, the aging widow who owns the garden. As Eva begins the project, hoping to interest others, she is trying to make peace with her move to Ireland, and her decision to raise her son on her own, without even the help of her family. As the volunteers assemble, each throws himself into his or her own section of the garden. With time, they begin to feel comfortable enough with each other to entrust bits and pieces of themselves, and a bond begins to form. Over the spring, summer and into the fall, these five people give new life to the garden, and in the process, themselves.

It's a relatively simple story of Eva Madigan discovering the overgrown walled garden space belonging to prickly Mrs. Prendergast and Eva wanting to bring the space back to life. At first, Mrs Prendergrast informs Eva of her intentions to sell the space for development but decides to let Eva try her green thumb, with the understanding that the space may yet be sold. Eva, along with neighborhood recruits Emily, Uri and Uri's son, Seth, revive the soil and return it to the magical garden it once was. Each character uses their time in the garden to mentally work through their own personal traumas and demons, hoping to find healing in their respective lives in the process of bringing life back to these plants. Their progress in the garden also seems to invigorate the neighborhood as a whole. People start picking up their trash more, treating each other with more kindness, and the garden's fruit and vegetable patch even manages to create extra produce for the local market, bringing additional income to the store's owner. I was really enjoying this story initially, but by story's end, I was a little disappointed. Given the description and the cover image, I had the impression that this story would have a more magical, light-hearted tone but it actually ended up being more on the dark, depressing side. The plot addresses some pretty heavy topics such as abusive relationships, struggles within motherhood / conceiving a child/ single parenting, unplanned pregnancies, alcoholism, anti-Semitism. One character struggles to come to terms with their spouse coming out as homosexual. There were no major plot surprises for me. Conflicts seemed a little too easily and too quickly resolved. The whole thing just seemed to be a little heavy on the \"after-school special\" feel. I also found that over the course of the story, the main character Eva grew pretty irritating -- she seemed pretty high strung, a little melodramatic. She thinks she's in love. Then she's not. Then she is. Then she's not. But wait, maybe though... Ugh. It just got tiring and made the story drag for me. The other issue I had was the fact that I didn't feel there was a definitive sense of Irish culture within the storyline. These characters are suppose to be living in Dublin, they mention County Mayo here and there, they occassionally drop a \"feckin eedgit\", oh and one guy mentions growing up in a thatched cottage... but if you took that away, this book could seriously be taking place in any metropolitan area anywhere, it seemed. Heck, I often had to remind myself that they were in Ireland. I kept picturing a New York brownstone neighborhood. That being said, I did get some enjoyment out of the story... it just didn't end up being as strong and memorable a tale as I had hoped. My favorite character backstories were those of Mrs. Prendergast and Uri. Those kept me reading to see how they connected to the storyline in the present time. I also liked the character of Seth, though I couldn't understand his having such a strong interest in Eva -- why do so many books push the idea that two people are perfect for each other just because they are both single parents? I didn't see much common ground between those two besides that. Yeah, in the end, just a so-so read for me."}, {"userName": "Sabine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12799503-sabine", "userReview": "Ein wundersch\u00f6nes Buch \u00fcber Freundschaften, die Liebe und das Leben!

Die Charaktere des Buches k\u00f6nnen unterschiedlicher nicht sein, jeder jedoch hat mich auf seine eigene Art fasziniert: Mrs. Prendergast als sture alte Lady, die im Verlauf des Buches jedoch auftaut und f\u00fcr die ich, nachdem ich ihre Geschichte kannte, durchaus Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr ihr Verhalten zeigen konnte.

Aber auch er hat eine Vergangenheit, die im Laufe der Erz\u00e4hlung zu Tage tritt und mich wirklich sehr beeindruckt und nachdenklich zur\u00fcckgelassen hat.

Durch ihre neuen Freunde stellt sie sich ihrem Schicksal, nimmt das Leben an die Hand und genie\u00dft es in vollen Z\u00fcgen!Der Schreibstil ist sehr einfach gehalten und l\u00e4sst sich gut und schnell lesen, die geschickte Aufteilung der Kapitel, die sich an den Jahreszeiten orientieren, unterst\u00fctzt den Lesefluss. Dabei kommen auch Beschreibungen des Gartens selber nicht zu kurz, die wachsende und gedeihende Gr\u00fcnanlage konnte ich mir gut vorstellen und vor meinem inneren Auge sehen. Der Aufbau des Romans ist prima gelungen, nach und nach lernt man die Personen n\u00e4her kennen und lieben.

Belonging to an iron-willed elderly lady named Mrs. Prendergast, who is rumored to have murdered and buried her husband there, the garden draws Eva Madigan, a young mother struggling to move on from the pain of her past. Eva is joined by Emily, a beautiful but withdrawn college dropout; Uri, an old-world immigrant; Seth, his all-too-handsome son; and occasionally even Mrs. Prendergast herself. But what drives Eva to transform the neglected urban wilderness? What makes the others want to help her? Even as Mrs. Prendergast puts the land up for sale, the thorny lives of all the gardeners are revealed and slowly start to untangle. Overgrown secrets are dug up and shared. Choices are made; a little pruning is in order. Now Eva is about to discover that every garden is a story of growth toward a final harvest.", "title": "Winter Bloom", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7841662-winter-bloom", "average": 3.81, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348766766l/7841662.jpg", "reviews": 153, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/317065.Tara_Heavey", "name": "Tara Heavey"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Romance", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7841662-winter-bloom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12737406-de-ierse-tuin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9507270-winter-bloom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8726636-sowing-the-seeds-of-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5018166-a-brush-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9347633-where-the-love-gets-in", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2132123.Eating_Peaches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35624679-flame", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36095821-sowing-the-seeds-of-love"]}
