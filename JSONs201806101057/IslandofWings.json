She writes with a lucid clarity that nonetheless perfectly complements the style of its time, the second quarter of the Nineteenth Century. I might quote numerous passages in which she goes further, to shift and refract English like a poet in her native tongue, but I realize that to do so would be untrue to the spirit of the book, which talks of life in a harsh environment, and where flights of fancy and sudden stabs of beauty are the prized exception rather than the rule.The novel is a fictionalized account of the stay on the islands of St. Kilda by its first minister, the Rev. Neil MacKenzie and his wife Elizabeth, from 1830 to 1843. I know several of the closer Scottish islands, but have never visited St. Kilda, which is over forty miles from the Outer Hebrides, a group of rocky islands and sea stacks piercing the raw Atlantic. Its cliffs, which are the highest in Britain, are home to millions of sea birds whose flesh and feathers constituted virtually the sole livelihood of the inhabitants until the islands were forcibly evacuated in 1930. Some years ago, I happened to see a music-theater piece in Gaelic about the islanders, whose extraordinary adaptation to their vertical world and ultimate fate moved me greatly. Altenberg captures all this beautifully, but she goes further by making her book a penetrating study both of colonialism and the crushing grip of organized religion.When Neil McKenzie arrives on Hirta, the only inhabited island, he finds a people still living in prehistoric sunken dwellings among the warmth and droppings of their animals, a people still mired in pagan superstition. It is his clear calling to spread Christianity and bring these near-savages to the light, a God-given opportunity to atone for a personal failure in his past that we will learn more about as the book continues. If he dimly recognizes some Utopian elements in a society where all property is held in common and decisions are made in communal meetings where all attend, he sees this merely as fertile ground in which to sow the Gospel seed. By example, force of will, and hard work, he gets the islanders to learn the catechism, attend his sermons, and build a modern village where each house has its separate piece of walled land. Proud of his work, he does not heed the advice of an early visitor: \"Do you not understand that as you take authority of their souls and minds they will turn to you as to a God? Do you not fear the consequences of your tuition?\" With the slow inevitability of tragedy, we see all this happen. MacKenzie, though committed to his faith, is a narrow and weak man at heart, and this island will destroy him.The center of sympathy in the book, though, is the minister's wife Lizzie, who comes to St. Kilda as a new bride. Unlike her husband, she cannot speak Gaelic, and so must depend entirely on him for conversation until he gets her an English-speaking servant from the mainland. With the loss of her first three children to accident and illness, and of her husband to the self-imposed demands of his mission, she falls prey to a loneliness that has her questioning her own faith and even the meaning of love. But\u2014and here's the last amazing thing\u2014despite her loneliness, despite the bleak environment, despite the slow destruction of the islanders' way of life, Karin Altenberg still manages to fill her book with warmth and beauty, and a sense of life as stirring as the wind and waves around St. Kilda itself."}, {"userName": "Christine Blachford", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5642580-christine-blachford", "userReview": "I\u2019ve got mixed feelings about this one. The amount of research that has gone into this shines through from the very start, and it becomes obvious quite quickly that this is a fiction story layered on top of what really should have been a non-fiction piece about the island of St Kilda.There are detailed descriptions about the people, about their customs and unique way of life, from the way they hunt puffins to the way a marriage ceremony unfolds. Based on letters and records from the island at the time, the story fictionalises a real life attempt to bring Christianity to the island.The trouble is that the story, whilst interesting enough, isn\u2019t given enough time to breathe. The characters are held at arm\u2019s length so that you can never really know why they are motivated to do something. Although we are given insights into what they are thinking at selected times, the narrative flip flops between characters without any clear path.Overall, it was interesting enough to hold my attention, and a fascinating glimpse of life on an island that appears quite hostile to human life. The characters and story don\u2019t quite live up to the promise, though."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "(3.5) An accomplished and atmospheric novel set on the remote British island of St. Kilda between 1830 and 1843, inspired by the story of the historical MacKenzie family. (Minor spoilers follow.) As in Lucy Caldwell\u2019s The Meeting Point, the main character is a missionary\u2019s wife, Lizzie MacKenzie, who finds herself isolated in an unfamiliar environment where religious and linguistic differences make assimilation difficult. A theme in both novels is the cooling of the relationship with a distant husband, accompanied by the temptation to have an affair with a \u2018dark\u2019 (racially other) attractive stranger.In Island of Wings about 80% of babies seem to die within eight days of birth, of unexplained and torturous seizures. Altenberg explains in her afterword that the cause was neonatal tetanus, possibly caused by the unsterilized knives used to cut umbilical cords or the high percentage of metals in the soil from buried seabird corpses, and the mortality rate was nearer 60%. Lizzie miscarries a baby, and then loses twins to the eight-day sickness, but goes on to have six healthy babies during their stay on St Kilda.The novel has a bit of a meandering plot \u2013 moved along only when strangers arrive on the island \u2013 but Jane Housham was perceptive in noting in her Observer review that \u201cStark dichotomies lend structure where plot, inevitably, plays less of a role.\u201d Pairs of opposites like civilization versus savagery, outsiders versus natives, organized religion versus superstition, and compassion versus cruelty form the backbone of the book, along with the strong sense of place. My favorite incidents were, in fact, the visits from strangers: the naturalist brothers, who are disciples of Bewick from Northumberland; and Solano, the injured Spanish convict with whom Lizzie falls in love.The prose is good, if occasionally purplish, and there is only the rare reminder that English is not Altenberg\u2019s native tongue. She is in fact Swedish, but studied for an archaeology PhD at the University of Reading, of all places! Her deep knowledge of the social and natural history of St Kilda sets this historical novel a cut above the average."}, {"userName": "Joanne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4979664-joanne", "userReview": "I was really looking forward to reading this novel - I'd picked a couple of books based in the Scottish Highlands and Islands for my visit to the Highlands, and I thought that that idea behind the book was really interesting - the author has obviously done a lot of research into the subject, by writing a fictional story based on historical fact, and I admire the amount of work she has put into it. But I just really didn't like the style of writing. I love descriptive books that sweep me away, but the descriptions here felt kind of stilted and forced. I felt no identification with the characters at all, in fact I felt utterly removed from them. There is far too much 'telling' of the story, and I think I found the way it was written, in the third person, too impersonal. I was incredibly disappointed and in fact gave up before reaching the end as I wanted a good book to fall into for my holiday. So I picked up Night Waking by Sarah Moss, another novel touching on a similar theme & place, which thankfully was much, much better."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1410180-kimberly", "userReview": "I read this book for three challenges. My Around the World challenge which I can knock Scotland off my list because this book takes place on the the island of St. Kilda which is off the coast of Scotland. I also read this for my RCC Challenge, and the NetGalley 2012 Reading Challenge. My first love is history, I had to sit through hours and hours of The History Channel, The Discovery Channel, National Geographic Channel etc. as a kid thanks to my dad so unlike a lot of other kids, I actually love history. This has translated into a great love for historical fiction and while you haven't seen me review a lot of these titles don't worry :) The reviews are coming I'm just trying to branch out an explore other genres. I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I was kind of hesitant to read it because I learned that the book wasn't originally published in English and sometimes when a novel gets translated things get lost...in translation. Sorry, I had to say it. Anyways, I was a little concerned but I quickly realized my fears were misplaced.Karin Altenberg has written a beautiful novel that is based on a real man Neil McKenzie who really was a reverend on the Island of St. Kilda. I thought that Karin did a fantastic job for getting the tone of her novel perfect. In my opinion she did an excellent job of recreating life during that time. Most of all I love how you could sense that she wrote every word with conviction.The author also has a gift at creating characters that actually evoke emotions. Lizzie, Neil's young wife was my favourite character. I hated how Neil treated her and made her feel weak and stupid. However I'm glad to see that she grew as a character throughout the whole novel. I felt so bad for her. She's thrust into a new life, on an isolate island where her husband is the only one that can speak English with her, she's also coming to terms with her impending motherhood and struggling to find the real Lizzie.I personally HATED Neil. The way he treated Lizzie was abhorrent to me and the fact that he treated her so poorly to make up for his own mistakes sickened me. However, just because I hate Neil and wanted to strangle him at several points in the book I feel that Karin wrote him very realistically. I did not agree with Neil much throughout the book if ever. I know that he went to St. Kilda with good intentions but I think he failed the islanders in a lot of ways. Most of all I hated how he looked down on them from his holier than thou pedestal that he placed himself on. It really irritated me but it worked for the novel as a whole.I also enjoyed the setting. I felt as if I were actually in the places where scenes in the book took place. She was descriptive without overdoing it and that enabled her to write the scenes beautifully. It's wonderful to find an author who is skilled at making the reader feel as if they are present in the novel.I think that this book was rich in history and though I didn't always see eye to eye with Neil I think that Karin Altenberg is extremely adept at creating characters, she makes them so realistic you can't help but admire her skill in writing. The novel as a whole is a great example of a debut author writing a fantastic piece of historical fiction. I would have absolutely no problem recommending this book to anyone. I especially recommend it to lovers of historical fiction and those who may be new to the genre. It's great book and is now one of my new favourites. I can see myself reading this one again and again. *I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for my freehonest review.\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605"}, {"userName": "Beadyjan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2845570-beadyjan", "userReview": "This review also features on my book blog http://beadyjansbooks.blogspot.co.uk/I chose this book as it appeals to my longing for escape, I love to read about women who have settled somewhere remote and alien to their usual surroundings and you can't get much more remote than the Isle of St Kilda.This book tells the account of the lives of true couple Reverend Neil McKenzie and his wife Lizzie who in 1830 take up residence on the Scottish Island of St Kilda to bring Christianity to the barely civilised, superstitious Gaelic speaking islanders who live in mounds of earth, eat little but seabirds and are resistant to change. Life on St Kilda is hard, barbarous and pitiless and deprivation and hardship are a way of life.Its a brutal yet beautiful location and Lizzie finds the isolation devastatingly lonely yet finds a solace in the wildness and freedom of the island. Unable to communicate with the islanders she finds it hard to get to know them and as her husband becomes increasingly moody and hurtful towards her she struggles to cope.Battling to cope with the death of her firstborn drives a wedge between the couple and leads Lizzie to seek companionship with the local women, united in tragedy as the mortality rate of newborns is terribly high on the island most dying within a week of birth.The book describes an unusual setting, the struggles of a difficult relationship made harder by having to rely so heavily on each other for companionship despite having been virtual strangers when wed. Life must have been incredibly lonely and hard for this young bride in an era when breaking away from the constraints of conventional life was virtually impossible and when women did seize the opportunity of escape there was no going back and they just had to make do with what was thrown at them.A fascinating look at life on an island like no other, although in some parts I found the story dragged but overall a worthwhile read especially for anyone who has an interest or curiosity about the setting of St Kilda."}, {"userName": "Mij Woodward", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5222282-mij-woodward", "userReview": "I am unable to finish reading this book because it feels like a TV docudrama meant to reveal life on treeless Hirta in 1830, what day-to-day life was iike for the native St. Kildans living there, and what life was like for a minister and his wife who moved there from Scotland. The idea for this book is absolutely fascinating to me, and I admit, I have loved learning about the dwelling places of the inhabitants and their way of life, surviving on birds for the most part. I am fascinated by the character of Lizzie, wife of the minister, who lives an almost completely isolated life on the island, shut away in the minister's house next to the church, unable to speak the language of the St. Kildans.The problem I am having is that I cannot seem to get into the shoes of Lizzie or care much for her, other than watching from a distance to see how she struggles. Same with her husband, the minister, and the local St. Kildans. I am watching them all from a distance.I will skim through the rest of the book, as I want to find out what happens to Lizzie and the rest. The skimming will allow me to skip the many details of hunting for birds and the like. I do not want a lesson in the social history of Hirta. I want a story about people, their feelings, a problem to be solved, with the social history part on the side.Later - FINISHED SKIMMING. This skimming allowed me to find more and more things about this book that totally irritated me. The conversations between husband and wife seemed stilted and weird. One chapter was devoted to a shipwrecked pirate whom Lizzie nursed back to health and then experienced a \"bodice-ripper\" moment with him, and later a similar but not so enjoyable \"bodice-ripper\" moment with her husband. Much of the dialogue between any of the characters felt contrived, or like a badly-written play.All sorts of \"telling\" instead of showing went on, throughout the book.My half-reading and half-skimming of this book did succeed in two ways for me: (1) I learned about the history of Hirta (thanks to Wikipedia), including the phenomenon of \"neonatal tetanus\" and the early deaths of many of the St. Kildans' infants.(2) My belief about the silliness of book awards has been confirmed. HOW DID THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE ORANGE PRIZE PUT THIS POORLY WRITTEN BOOK ON THE LONGLIST?Yet, of course, I want the people behind the Orange Prize to continue with their longlists and shortlists, for it is from these lists I get ideas for my next \"to-read\" books.

Geographically remote, isolation emerged as the predominant theme of life in this sequestered corner of the world. Nowhere is this concept better illustrated than in Altenberg's portrayal of Lizzie McKenzie. Newly married and pregnant, Lizzie views St. Kilda as an adventure. Soon after her arrival, her fantasies are shattered by tragedy and she is forced to acknowledge the true nature of her situation. Removed from the natives by a difference of both culture and language, Lizzie must push the limits of her own character or perish. Historically, Altenberg did her homework in regards to both the islands and their inhabitants. The descriptions of the native culture were extraordinarily detailed and skillfully folded into the plot. The additional exploration of the nature of faith, ethics and the relationship between a man and wife added an appealing emotional quality to the novel. Thoroughly impressive as Island of Wings is Altenberg's debut novel.The flowery prose is somewhat overwhelming but underneath there exists a captivating story of hope and commitment. There is no denying that Island of Wings is a beautiful interpretation of the harsh realities of life on St. Kilda but is also a insightful tale of human nature and our ability to overcome. Powerfully moving if one can navigate the composition.

I fell in love with being able to live life as others did, even if it was vicariously. I picked this book because the New Hebrides Islands were an area that I had never explored before, which intrigued me. I had read many books about and taking place in Scotland, but never anything in this particular area. The first thing that amazed me about this book was the author's portarayal of the lives of the Islanders and how bleak it was. The next amazing thing was that the Reverend McNeil and his wife were actaul historical characters, and not just fictional characters that the author used to describe the story. The story of the lives of the Reverend and his wife was fascinating, as was the underlying history. There were many characters that engendered both interest and sympathy. In short, I was not disappointed in Karin Altenbergs portrayal of the lives of The Reverend McNeil and his wife, their time on the Island of St. Kilda, and the lives of the Islanders. As with a lot of the good historical fiction that I have read, this book has enticed me to read and learn more about the Reverend McNeil, the Island of St. Kilda, and the changes in the Church of Scotland that were occurring at this time.

Zudem herrschen auf der Insel schockierende hygienische Zust\u00e4nde, und der junge Pfarrer macht sich die Verbesserung der Lebensumst\u00e4nde, aber insbesondere die Bekehrung der Inselbewohner zu einem reinen Christentum zur Lebensaufgabe. Denn den tief verwurzelten Aberglaube der Menschen gilt es auszumerzen.Fiktionalisierte Romanfassungen des Lebens historischer Personen geh\u00f6ren zu meinen liebsten Lesestoffen. Auch Karin Altenbergs Charaktere haben wirklich gelebt und sie vermag es, sie mit einer tiefgehenden Charakterzeichnung wiederauferstehen zu lassen.

Die Zivilisation schreitet voran, alte Sitten und Gebr\u00e4uche oder gar Glaubensvorstellungen haben in der Moderne keinen Platz. Dass Neil sich ausgerechnet auf die abgelegene Insel St. Kilda oder Hirta schicken l\u00e4sst, ist teilweise auch seinem schlechten Gewissen geschuldet, denn bei einem Seeunfall, den er \u00fcberlebte, starb ein Freund. Neils Ambitionen auf St. Kilda schlagen in \u00fcberzogenen Ehrgeiz und Arroganz um, er beginnt, sich mehr und mehr als Herrscher der Insel zu sehen, und gegen\u00fcber seiner jungen Frau entwickelt er ein v\u00f6llig unberechtigtes Misstrauen. Er wird hart und kalt, hat kein Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr ihre Bed\u00fcrfnisse und ihre zaghaften Versuche, sich an die Sitten der Inselbev\u00f6lkerung anzupassen.

Andererseits leben die Bewohner im Einklang mit der Natur, sie sind g\u00e4nzlich frei und haben eine flaches demokratisches System, das regelrecht utopisch erscheint. Die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Rolle f\u00fcr die Wirtschaft der Insel spielen die Seev\u00f6gel, deren Bejagung uns heute freilich etwas grausam anmutet.

It is true. That is in here. Neil and Lizzie MacKenzie would have faced challenges enough in their new marriage by becoming missionaries to the remote Scottish islands of St Kilda, basically a few rocks way out in a stormy ocean, covered with aggressive, stinking seabirds. Communication and supplies from the outside world come only once or twice a year by boat. Lizzie doesn't even speak the language (Gaelic) of the few families on the island, who live the same way there ancestors did a thousand years ago. Their marriage is made even more difficult because Neil MacKenzie really needed serious therapy. He was suffering survivor guilt from a shipwreck years ago where his friend had drowned and he had lived. This caused him to be emotionally distant (and sometimes cruel) with his wife, and driven and overbearing with his parishioners. It was almost surprising that Lizzie and Neil managed to have as many tender moments (and as many children) as they did. But this book is not really about the MacKenzies and their marriage. This book is about St Kilda. It is about the stark, cathedral-like beauty of the \"stacks\" (towers of rock), and rocky bays. It is about the flora and fauna: so many birds that the cliffs look like they are made out of white rock because white feathers cover every inch of them, and also rugged sheep, and fish, and seals. It is mostly about the people who live there, their traditions, and living conditions, and marriage customs. The people live in rock houses built by their ancestors. They are more like burrows. There are no windows. They must be entered on hands and knees. The animals live inside, and the floor is covered with a layer of filth that accumulates all winter, and is shoveled out in the spring. The smell makes the visitors gag, but the locals are used to it. They sing and talk all day. They work the land in common, fertilizing the fields with rotted bird carcasses. Their one great sorrow is that most of the babies die within eight days. They didn't know, but we do, that this was from tetanus. This really is St Kilda's story, and I found it fascinating. I recommend to anyone who reads it to Google images of St Kilda, and see for yourself the scenes described in the book. I believe the author truly loves St Kilda, and that shines in some of the book's lyrical passages. Neil and Lizzie MacKenzie are real historical characters. The real history of St Kilda that lies outside the scope of this book is also interesting, that eventually (in 1930) the island would be abandoned, and all of its inhabitants relocated, because life there was just too hard for the last few remaining. The MacKenzie's church and house, and the stone cottages Neil helped build for the people, remain. And of course, the rocks and birds remain."}, {"userName": "Lydia Laceby", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3322071-lydia-laceby", "userReview": "Originally Reviewed at Novel EscapesRated 3.5 StarI didn\u2019t love Island of Wings and I didn\u2019t hate it. I was interested enough to continue to see what happened and at times found it horrific and fascinating but overall, I\u2019m just not sure this novel was for me. Island of Wings is a historical novel about the Island of St Kilda, the inhabitants and a Reverend and his wife who are posted there to guide the \u2018savages\u2019 into modern life. Based on real people, the novel is a fictitious account of their life there, with historically accurate events and details.Religious fanatics don\u2019t appeal to me in any way, so the Reverend\u2019s quest for redemption didn\u2019t keep me reading. Instead, I loved his wife\u2019s story. Lizzie\u2019s plight among people that she couldn\u2019t communicate with and who lived a completely foreign life to her with an increasingly distant husband was intriguing. I kept wondering what I would do in such a situation and with limited resources and in a time that a woman wasn\u2019t able to make bold moves regarding herself or her family. Her loneliness was palpable and heart wrenching and I enjoyed watching her initially try to cope and eventually understand the natives more than her husband who was trying to lead them. The relationships she cultivated with the other women was heart warming and there was one scene in particular that actually had me giggling and yet another gagging. The pagan superstitions and rituals were fascinating and I found the attempts of the Reverend to crush them both irritating and amusing when unveiled how entrenched they were to island life. The mysterious deaths of babies on this island broke my heart many times over and the entire way through the novel I wanted to know why. I was finally rewarded in the notes and acknowledgements, so if you\u2019re interested in why the neonatal rate on the island was so high, keep reading.The details and description of the Island were both gruesome and fascinating. They lived on such barren land, yet the inhabitants somehow managed to survive. The details of all the birds eventually blended together for me, with the exception of how the islanders survived winter and the stench which was described many times over and actually had me gagging in certain instances. There were really long passages in this novel which I tended to grow cross eyed at and I had to check early on that St Kilda was a real place and where it was located as for some reason I apparently missed it. But that said, there was enough in Island of Wings to maintain my interest and keep me flipping pages."}, {"userName": "Ellie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3145939-ellie", "userReview": "In 1830, Reverend Neil Mckenzie and his young wife, Lizzie, make their way to the remote island of St Kilda to start a new life and bring Christianity to the Pagan inhabitants. Poor, poor Lizzie. She is an English speaker on an island where everyone speaks Gaelic, except her husband, who is more interested in saving souls than keeping his wife company. It must have been an incredibly lonely life for her in the early days, isolated from the rest of the world. The infant mortality rate on the island was shockingly high and Lizzie suffers along with the other women, finding a bond amongst tragedy. Whilst based in fact, and the personal aspect of Island of Wings is fictional, it is not difficult to imagine this would have been the case.The history books may have Mackenzie down as a man who brought civilised ways to St Kilda but Altenberg rewrites him as a man obsessed with religion, blind to the needs of those around him and zealous with the desire to turn the islanders to Christianity. The islanders themselves, seem rather tolerant of the missionary but it doesn't work both ways and I found myself feeling anger towards him. It may have been normal for the day, but the idea of forcing religion on people is awful and he comes across as quite oppressive. He is too worried what other people may think of him and some of the thoughts he has about his wife are unforgivable. He even treats his children with coldness.The writing is evocative of the landscape with its beauty and its harshness. It is indeed an island of many wings, with birds playing a crucial role in both their survival and their superstitions. I found the history of the island and how they coped fascinating. I recently read of the guga culls of modern day Lewis in Peter May's The Black House and it was interesting to see the origin of the custom. The harvest of seabirds was essential to survival, with food being scarce and no regular supplies brought in from the mainland.In the end, St Kilda was not a viable place to live and the island is now uninhabited, although the native sheep still roam the hillsides. Read for the descriptions and the history, especially if you have an interest in the evolution of religion in the Highlands and Islands.

In 1830 the Reverend Neil MacKenzie and his wife Lizzie arrive on the island St. Kilda to do missionary work. The MacKenzies are hopeful, in love and happily expecting their first child. They are full of vigorous believe that their efforts to educate the populace of the island on all topics but especially God will set them all on the right path. And. If the island happens to turn more British during the process? So much the better. Don\u2019t think that because the topic is religion and the island is in Scotland not Africa or Asia that Island of Wings isn\u2019t also about colonialism. St. Kilda was settled a thousand years before the MacKenzies arrived to do a makeover by Gaelic speaking Norsemen. Arriving at St Kilda the young couple is shocked to discover a place that seems medieval compared to the luxuries they left behind. Although only 40 miles off the coast of Scotland, the island might was well be 400 miles away for all the comfort that is there. A few times a year the taxman would come to the island to collect revenue and to drop off supplies otherwise the islanders provide for themselves what they need. This is a hardscrapple place to live. The islanders are raggedly dressed, their homes are filthy, malnutrition is rampant and one in three newborns does not survive their first week. These challenges that met the MacKenzies are quickly compounded. Only Neil speaks Gaelic so Lizzie\u2019s isolation is immediate. Lizzie\u2019s child is still born and the wretched bleakness of the lives around her further forces Lizzie into her own world. Neil\u2019s efforts to convert the natives are hardly successful and his plans to reorganize how they do their farming have dire consequences. In a spare writing style Karin Altenberg has done four things very well in Island of Wings: history, geography, people and politics. She has given us intriguing historical details, a world impossible to imagine, characters that change not because they grow older but because of circumstance and experience and a powerful lesson in the politics of faith. Island of Wings is an impressive, thoughtful novel."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/737986-kimberly", "userReview": "Island of Wings is a well-written portrayal of the isolated lives of a missionary and his family on the island of St. Kilda, Scotland, in the 1830s and 1840s. I've never been to St. Kilda, and I obviously wasn't alive in the 19th century, but this book just feels authentic. While I was reading it, I really got a sense of the characters' inner personalities and a sense of the bleakness of the island. For example, Lizzie is written in what I believe to be a true to the time period manner. Lately I've read books set in the 19th century and the female characters are spunky and confident and capable in ways that I don't find believable for the time period. Lizzie, however, shows these characteristics once in a while, like when she goes swimming in the luminescent ocean one night or occasionally stands up for herself when speaking to Neil, but for the most part she quietly accepts her lot in life and kowtows to her husband, which is what I would expect from a 19th century woman, given what I know about women and their standing in society at that time."}, {"userName": "Laurie Frost", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13477692-laurie-frost", "userReview": "I don't go in for historical fiction as a rule, and would not categorize this as such, although it does use as its protagonists a real-life Church of Scotland minister and his wife.What attracted me to it is the setting: St. Kilda, a tiny island west of the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides, which was evacuated of its last few dozen residents in the 1930s after thousands of years of human habitation. No reported serious crimes in the island's history, and none of its citizens ever fought in a war, as far as is known. No money economy until its last years, either.Reading about the way of life on the island in the first half of the 19th century is fascinating in itself, and the depiction of the spiritual crises and strains of isolation and outsider status on the marriage of the minister and his wife is compelling, too.Not a plot-driven novel; this one's strengths are setting and characters."}, {"userName": "Vic Van", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15874338-vic-van", "userReview": "Occasionally, one is totally absorbed by a book and this was such a book.

As a print product, it looks unglamorous, with a plain printed hard cover of what looks like an old engraving of a sailing ship on rough seas. But on the front is a recommendation by Anne Enright, who wrote the lush and, frankly, eye-brow-raising The Pleasure of Eliza Lynch (2002). And another by the also wonderful Andrew O\u2019Hagan, who wrote the topsy-turvy and insightful The Life and Opinions of Maf the Dog, and of His Friend Marilyn Monroe (2010). So, with this high praise from noteworthy authors, and never having read a novel by Altenberg, I was intrigued. There is mention in the blurb on the back of the book of some haunting, or fearsome thing, on the island where the novel is set, the islands of St. Kilda, the westernmost islands of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, as northern and as remote a place as you could find outside of the Arctic Circle. The reader finds out, not so much during the novel as towards the end, what the haunting is that drives the young evangelical minister from the Church of Scotland to the islands, and again, off the islands. What changes during his time there, and what does he and his wife achieve?The novel is a fictionalization of the life of the actual Reverend Neil MacKenzie who arrived on St. Kilda\u2019s Hirta Island as a missionary on 3 July 1830, to bring the handful of \u201cpagan heathens\" on the island back to the proper ways of the Church of Scotland. (Well, they weren\u2019t actual heathens. They just weren\u2019t particularly observant or church-going according to MacKenzie\u2019s standards.) At that time, Britain was changing from the Georgian Period to the rule of Queen Victoria. It was a time of immense social change with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and social reform in areas such as the abolition of slavery, prison reform and social justice, and an evangelical revival.MacKenzie was there at the behest of the Laird of St. Kilda, who owned the land, and the Church, which was his employer. In 1843, 13 years after he had arrived, the Church was split by what is now referred to as The Disruption of 1843. Four hundred and fifty evangelical ministers of the Church broke away, over the issue of the Church\u2019s relationship with the State, to form the Free Church of Scotland.The Church of Scotland had up till then claimed an inherent right to exercise independent spiritual jurisdiction over its own affairs. However, the right of \u201cpatronage\u201d, the right of a wealthy patron to install a minister of his choice into a parish, (like MacKenzie had been) became a point of contention between those who held that this infringed on the spiritual independence of the church, and those who regarded it as a matter of property under the state\u2019s jurisdiction.In 1834, the Veto Act was passed in the Church, which gave parishioners the right to reject a minister nominated by their patron. On 18 May 1843, this was followed by The Disruption, when 121 ministers and 73 elders led by Dr David Welsh, the retiring Moderator, left the Church of Scotland General Assembly at the Church of St. Andrew in George Street, Edinburgh, to form the Free Church of Scotland. Those Ministers that stayed would continue as they were, those that left forfeited livings, manses and pulpits, and had, without the aid of the establishment, to found and finance a national Church from scratch. MacKenzie chose to stay, not having the courage to face making a living and starting afresh without the financial backing of the church. It was a critical and terrible choice that was forced on him.So, against this background of paternalism and moral high ground, the fresh young missionary and his new, pregnant wife, Lizzie, arrived on the island of Herta, with a mission to impose their beliefs on the natives, who, until then, had survived pretty well by themselves, other than starving through long bouts of violent storms. You may well ask why they lived there. But consider that this is the early 1800s. The Past, (as in The Go-Between by LP Hartley), is a foreign country. They do things differently there. MacKenzie goes from being an advisor, to a shepherd, to a tyrant, to a self-doubting, hallucinating wreck. Nothing much happens to him, at least nothing worse than what regularly happens to the islanders \u2013 starvation, drowning, freezing, attacks by pirates, and the regular, predictable deaths of their babies. His is the terror of a man losing his belief in the justification of his cause. The neonatal deaths, are, first, just one more peculiarity of island life. Soon it becomes an important sub-theme. Decades later these deaths were identified as possibly being caused by tetanus or lockjaw, due to the villagers putting infected or dirty oil from the fulmar seabirds of the island on the umbilical wounds of the babies. The villagers used the seabird that massed on the islands for everything; food, fuel, clothes, shoes, bedding, medicine, etc. \u201cLizzie looked down at the end of the rope in her hands. It seemed to have been made of some kind of organic material knotted together. \u2026\u2019What is this?\u2019 she asked in a hoarse whisper. \u2018I thought the life lines that we shared would take me to them. Through this cord they were attached to me, each one of them, and when they were born I failed them. I wanted to be pulled back to them\u2026\u2019 Lizzie could not make out the rest of the sentence. She looked in horror at the dried umbilical cords in her hands. They had been preserved in oil and tied together, all six of them, into a rope that was about six feet long. What grief would drive a person to such madness?\u201d (p. 284)While the first baby of the MacKenzies dies, like those of the islanders, their other children do not, presumably because they were not treated in the same way as the villagers\u2019 babies. The infant deaths are an indicator of the separation between the islanders and the MacKenzies in terms of both lifestyle and beliefs. The MacKenzies briefly get involved with the villagers, and their firstborn baby dies. They step back, retreat to their manse and their church, and keep well away, refusing to be dragged down to the villagers\u2019 level of \u201cbarbarity\u201d. Their other children live to grow up, while the villagers\u2019 babies keep dying. Yet, the MacKenzies remain outsiders, and while Neil is repulsed by the islanders, Lizzie is not, though he forbids her from getting involved with them. Still, life on the island drags them closer and closer to their congregation, and exposes their weaknesses as individuals and as a couple. You might think this is all historical fact and would be pretty boring stuff to read, but Altenberg\u2019s depictions of the islands, and the immutable contrasts between the MacKenzies and the islanders, and the slowly, subtly shifting feelings of Neil and Lizzie are finely observed and captivating. They drove me to find out more about an island group that I didn\u2019t even know existed.Lizzie:\u201cShe remembered the young man she loved all those years ago: the man whom her young self adored; the firm body that would arouse her; the eyes that aspired to know her. How she loved him then; she would follow him anywhere. He seemed to walk ahead of her, opening all the doors and letting in the light. She had followed him here, to this life. Did I follow the man or the love? She asked herself as she rubbed his damp limbs. Now she stroked his sagging muscles and coarse skin, hot and humid. For all the old love she stroked it \u2013 wanting it to go cool and dry again. The body she had once loved. His grey hair. Remembering the strong thighs and narrow hips...He dreams of birds. Of wings and noise and air. White wings batting the air. The noise! Island of wings. He hears a curlew\u2019s call. Or is it a man laughing? And then another dream; somebody is pulling him underwater. \u201c (pp. 292, 293)Neil: \u201cLooking at her he felt lost and betrayed. She had lost her firm body and there was something dusty about her. Had he brought her to this? He tried to remember her as she had been when they were first married \u2013 but it was impossible. But still he knew; he knew that she had been beautiful and that he had been able to love. That she alone had made it possible for him to love.\u201d (p. 295)The terror that stalks MacKenzie (referred to in the blurb) is not the weather or the poverty or the increasing alienation from his wife, or even confronting his cowardice. It is the growing realization that he cannot force his beliefs on others, that what he is doing is futile, that the islanders will not change and that he would have wasted his life and achieved nothing.\"\u2018I have watched them as closely as a scientist looks at insects under a glass. I have been able to touch them, to heal them, to encourage them, to instruct them \u2013 but still I do not understand them.\u2019 She made a sound that might have been a sigh. \u2018You have kept yourself aloof and apart from them. You saw them as a problem that needed to be solved. But they were never the problem.\u2019 He shook his head but she was not sure he was listening. She had suddenly had enough of him and his self-pity. There was intensity and some of the old spirit in her voice as she said, \u2018The only way we can come to understand other beings is by tainting them with a bit of ourselves. When we are all covered by the same filth it is possible to understand each other \u2013 and to believe in each other.\u2019\u201d (p.296)The real MacKenzie left St. Kilda in 1844, and although he had achieved a great deal in terms of agriculture and infrastructure, the weakness of the St. Kildans\u2019 dependence on external authority was exposed in 1865 with the arrival of the new minister. Despite their fondness for Mackenzie, who stayed in the Church of Scotland, the St. Kildans came out in favour of the new Free Church formed during The Disruption. So they just did what they wanted, in any case. And they were not half as uninformed or illiterate as MacKenzie had thought they were.St. Kilda may have been permanently inhabited for at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was evacuated from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months. After all the ministers, missionaries, lairds, and governors and society types had come and gone, all that was left were the St. Kildans, and the islands in their harsh glory. Nothing had changed, really. Today, the little restored stone cottages, built by MacKenzie and the islanders as an alternative to their \u201cprimitive\u201d thick-walled communal huts, still stand empty, buffeted by the wind.Perhaps this is not what Altenberg wanted readers to get out of the novel. Perhaps the novel is simply is a reflection of those times, and an accurate and fascinating one at that. At the same time, every work of fiction, like a poem, establishes an unspoken liaison between reader and author. The author puts it out there. The reader may interpret it any way they like. The connection, the shared experience, is the reward.This is what I got out of Island of Wings: For a moment, I was there, on the wind-swept, bird-filled St. Kilda islands, glad that I have never had the inclination to convert anyone to anything.

I knew a bit about the island because I have a daughter who is terribly interested in it and has several books on the island's history. These reference books came in handy as I read the novel. I could not give the book more than 3 stars however because I felt that the story line was a bit weak - at times I forgot what the actual story was about and was more interested in the historic facts. I think the author did her homework well, except in one area: the Presbyterian faith. I was not raised in the Church of Scotland, or Free Church of Scotland, but I was raised a Protestant and have learned from a young age the differences between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. I don't think the author knows the difference very well. The Presbyterians (Protestants) in this book often spoke like Roman Catholics.Right away on page 6: \"...we must always be prepared to recognise a source of penance and the possibility of redemption.\" Penance? Possibility of redemption? Elsewhere, about a new born who had died soon after birth: \"He lived long enough to hear the sacraments and be baptised into the Christian faith.\" Uhhh, what sacraments? There's only two for Protestants; baptism and the Lord's Supper. There's more: \"What suffering do I need to endure to redeem myself!\" Would a Presbyterian minister really ask that?At one point the Reverend spoke of \"the sacrament of marriage\". Again, in the Protestant tradition marriage is not a sacrament, in the R.C. tradition it is.Then there were slightly confusing bits, like the Reverend \"made the sign of the cross\", not something I've ever seen a Protestant minister do. And the Minister's wife thinking back how she would \"embroider monograms on wedding sheets on long Sunday afternoons\". Maybe it was different in Scotland, but where I'm from, in the 1830's it would have been a no-no for Protestant women to do any sewing, knitting or mending on a Sunday.All this (and other) strangely Roman Catholic sounding content took away some of my enjoyment of the book, because it just didn't make sense. Still, it's worth a read if you're interested in the history of St.Kilda. Not sure if the story itself would have held my interest though."}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3229648-caroline", "userReview": "This is a novel about Lizzie McKenzie, wife of a preacher sent to minister to the lonely island of St. Kilda, whose people live a rough existence on one of Scotland's most isolated islands. It follows her life over 15 or so years as her husband attempts to improve the villagers lives according to his own opinions.The sense of place was very well done and you get a very good sense of life on an island with no trees, little food, and \"houses\" that are more like burrows than shacks. You also get a good sense of the community, with their ancient myths and traditions and communal living. We don't actually get to know any of the villagers themselves that well, but as a collective whole they are well drawn.Yet Island of Wings is bleak and melancholy in tone, mainly due to the characters, especially the main characters of Lizzie and her husband. The narrative is generally third-person omniscient, so we do jump around from the head of one character to another, from Lizzie to her husband, to a visiting naturalist, to their maid, to a local boy, but we always ending up back with Lizzie and Neil. The characters and characterizations I have bit more of a problem with. Lizzie and Neil were real people, after all, and projecting onto them a sad and unhappy marriage seems a bit unfair. It also serves to hamstring what little plot there is. Nothing can happens between them because nothing did in real life. So they continue on, generally miserable. Lizzie's main characterization is her loneliness. So she's lonely and she's lonely and she's lonely and then the book ends.And while I was interested in what was going to happen to their island, I never warmed up to them. That is, I never really \"felt\" anything for them. Neil, especially, certainly wasn't likable. But then, I never really disliked him either, even when he was a specifically doing specifically unlikable things. I simply never cared.

On the ten-hour sail west from the Hebrides to the islands of St. Kilda, everything lies ahead for Lizzie and Neil McKenzie. Neil is to become the minister to the small community of islanders, and Lizzie, his new wife, is pregnant with their first child. Neil's journey is evangelical: a testing and strengthening of his own faith against the old pagan ways of the St. Kildans, but it is also a passage to atonement. For Lizzie -- bright, beautiful, and devoted -- this is an adventure, a voyage into the unknown. She is sure only of her loyalty and love for her husband, but everything that happens from now on will challenge all her certainties.As the two adjust to life on an exposed archipelago on the edge of civilization, where the natives live in squalor and subsist on a diet of seabirds, and babies perish mysteriously in their first week, their marriage -- and their sanity -- is threatened. Is Lizzie a willful temptress drawing him away from his faith? Is Neil's zealous Christianity unhinging into madness? And who, or what, is haunting the moors and cliff-tops?Exquisitely written and profoundly moving, Island of Wings is more than just an account of a marriage in peril -- it is also a richly imagined novel about two people struggling to keep their love, and their family, alive in a place of terrible hardship and tumultuous beauty.", "title": "Island of Wings", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11887751-island-of-wings", "average": 3.39, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1359623121l/11887751.jpg", "reviews": 161, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4811651.Karin_Altenberg", "name": "Karin Altenberg"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Cultural", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11887751-island-of-wings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13043254-island-of-wings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13614318-island-of-wings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11821554-island-of-wings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11887752-island-of-wings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26200710-breaking-light", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18270293-a-house-without-mirrors"]}
