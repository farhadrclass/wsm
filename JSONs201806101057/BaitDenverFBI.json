I just have to say I adored the heroine, Caisey. She's strong, sharp, funny, hardheaded, and totally real. In fact, all the characters, the story itself, and relationships were rich, complex, and very well written. One minute I'm scared, the next sighing with that sweet breath of love in bloom, then I'm crying, and then laughing, I love books that snatch me up and keep me guessing all the way through. This book did it all. Now I'm off to read the prequel!"}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26607110-annie", "userReview": "I usually say that with these kinds of books, there's not enough connection with the characters and too much focus on the FBI/law enforcement to be really good. In the case of this book, Bait had a little TOO much personal insight and not enough FBI... However, this book definitely had me keeping those pages flipping! I really loved that I rarely knew where the next turn in the book would take me. That alone kept me on my toes! I also really enjoyed the family dynamics and the interactions between the adults and Jake. Jake was a really good kid who took a big bump in the road of life, but the reader just knows that he'll end up ok, even with his one huge mistake and what led him to make that mistake. On the other hand, Jake being such a good kid as a teenager is kind of an oxymoron, you know? Don't all teenagers go through rough spots and stages of rebellion and so forth? It made Jake seem like a kid out of a fairy tale rather than a \"normal\" teenager. And again, the weaknesses in this book that caused me to rate it only three was that there were hardly any clues at all to lead me into even trying to figure out who the killer was. The whole book was wrapped around the Chloroform Killer, yet didn't bring the reader close enough to him to even TRY guessing who it might be. That left me thinking that this book was simply a romance novel with next to zero thrill. Sure, there were a couple of \"thrill spots,\" but barely enough to qualify. I like a writer who gives a reader clues to thinking \"maybe it's him\" or \"what if it's not him, but this other person\" kind of thing. That was missing in this book entirely. The other really big let-down was the \"climactic\" end - or rather, the lack thereof. There was nothing pointing to who the killer was, even after the reader finds out who it was. Yes, he showed up in one spot, but when the reader finds out he's was the guy all along, it doesn't even matter. And the FBI's reaction to the whole thing was a two word \"sentence\" just giving the name of the guy with one other sentence reminding the reader who he was. If the author had given enough clue along the way, then the ending to the book could have been really good. Instead, it was abrupt and absolutely non-climactic. Very disappointing ending. The ending also doesn't lead you to book two of this series. There's absolutely nothing to urge the reader to read book two. To sum it up, there was enough action to keep the pages turning, but the ending was a complete dud with no lead into book two."}, {"userName": "Lisa Hess", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29956926-lisa-hess", "userReview": "I'm not normally a fan of serial killer novels -- not on any moral grounds, I just dislike the nightmares -- but this novel and its prequel, Target, worked for me. There were no gratuitous gory details, but plenty of conflict and danger to maintain the tension and keep me turning the pages. In Bait, Lisa Phillips smoothly weaves together many different threads, relationships, mysteries and romances, and brings them all together in a satisfying ending. I read the prequel, Target, before I read Bait, which I would recommend. Keep in mind, though, Target is definitely the hors d'oeuvre to Bait's main course. If you're a fan of inspirational romantic suspense, Lisa Phillips is your author."}, {"userName": "Hilarey Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/913985-hilarey-johnson", "userReview": "Fun, quirky situations and a dynamic heroine.

The prequel was so good, I expected it to be much better. The characters were great. I loved that Gabe was more the nerdy type and not the typical hero. I really enjoyed the multiple viewpoints. My main issues with the story were the way it ended rather abruptly and the way it seemed to get sidetracked. At the beginning, I thought it was all about catching the Chloroform killer, then a whole other plot is exposed. I would have liked to see a little better mix of the two plotlines and a little more explanation of the reasoning. I liked the authors writing style, and despite not loving this story, I plan to read some more of her books."}, {"userName": "sandra sprenger", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31049874-sandra-sprenger", "userReview": "Two stories in one, neither worth the timeI have read a lot of mysteries, but this one is the worst. Finished only because I hoped it would get better. You have two stories going on, and they are not well blended. To much psycho babble happening in one story. The main mystery gets pushed to the back burner. You actually feel sorry for the main characters. I don't believe Ms. Phillips is a Christian because she uses it as a crutch in the story. I would not recommend this book to any one. Very poor storyline and the ending is a classic Disney."}, {"userName": "Gwen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1135788-gwen", "userReview": "The storyline was good and the action kept things moving. However, I struggled with the grammatical errors. Sometimes I had to re-read in order to figure out what the author really meant. There were other times I had to go back and decipher who was talking.
