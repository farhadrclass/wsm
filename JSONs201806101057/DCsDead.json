Here you'll find some very diverse characters in the Crawlspace crowd, a group of young men who gather at their hangout for tabletop RPG battles and share their lives as members of the alternative culture of DC. The crew happened to be gathered there when the whole zombie mess came down, their game interrupted by a tv broadcast that showed the Memorial Day celebration at the Arlington National Cemetery disrupted by a wash of oncoming undead. Lost, the group scrambles about trying to reach loved ones and face the shock of such a surreal scenario, but soon events begin to pull them away from the Crawlspace and out into the world around them as they seek some sense of stability in the chaos often facing true horror instead. Peppered with moments of humor, solid action, realistic interaction, varied and genuine characters with legitimate and complex backgrounds with which to respond to the events, DC's Dead manages to do something a lot of zombie books seem to walk around, laying out a realistic take on how real human beings would handle a zombie apocalypse, and it does a very nice job of it at that. I highly recommend this book to fans of the genre looking for a fresh take with characters outside of the often trite and overdone stereotypes we usually find in zombie fiction."}, {"userName": "Kevin Candela", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15243690-kevin-candela", "userReview": "If you are a fan of zombie fiction this one is pretty solid. Nothing new or innovative plot-wise, really, but still a good read. I'd call it a neo-classic style thriller. Admittedly there are some parts where description overrides action and the events proceed more like an old school zombie story...creeping rather than rushing along. Not that this is necessarily a negative: some folks really enjoy details and images a lot, so for those people there's plenty of description. I'd compare this story to an undead Fargo, in that the apocalypse almost takes a backseat (especially later) to something approaching predestination. The story starts (as the title suggests) in Washington, D.C., and gradually works its way out to an isolated retreat where the surviving heroes attempt to figure out some way to attempt to keep surviving. A touch of John Carpenter's The Thing here too, in that the futility grows moment by moment. I do question how a small town could keep functioning as half-decently as the one featured in this story, considering that small towns derive their vital utilities by and large from the same sources as the nearest big cities. But in general the events in this story are believable and the plot holds together well. Recommended for new-era zombie tale fans."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3638128-mary", "userReview": "It's not just undead people to look out for.This book has some charms to it. It glimpsed into the lives of people who are usually On the outside looking in. But through the story you find they are not very different. There is the good, the bad and the ugly. Then there are zombies."}, {"userName": "Lesley Henry", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41530066-lesley-henry", "userReview": "Not a bad read, I found it enjoyable but then again a lot of people might disagree with me. What is important to me is that there is a followable plot and good characters; plus I enjoyed reading it. Who says everyone has to survive the zompoc for it to be a good story."}, {"userName": "Tamara", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47378022-tamara", "userReview": "DC's Dead may be best described as a \"realistic zombie thriller.\" The true-to-life interaction in the middle of madness and straight-up action will keep you reading all the way through - enjoying every moment of the ride."}], "description": "When a small group of outcasts from the suburbs of Washington, DC witness the zombie apocalypse happening before their eyes, what will they do to survive and will they succeed?
