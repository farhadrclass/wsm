I'm not usually a fan of mystery/thrillers that don't deliver more substance in the build and hang everything on the answers, but with this book I think there's an even bigger problem: it's just not that original or shocking.I can predict that your enjoyment of this book depends on whether the ending is a surprise for you. Having read several mystery/thrillers, both YA and adult, I guessed the outcome when I read the very first chapter. Some of these kind of books have characters and a clever psychological exploration that is strong enough to survive a reader who figures it out, but We'll Never Be Apart is not one of those books.After a prologue in which Alice and Jason are in a fire set by Alice's twin sister - Cellie - the story moves to a mental hospital where Alice is being held. Everyone seems to think she set the fire that killed Jason, but Alice knows it was Cellie. She also knows that Cellie is being held in D Block and that it's only a matter of time before she comes to finish Alice off.If you've read this kind of book before, you might have already guessed it from that small blurb. If you've read books like Vanishing Girls or Twisted Fate, there's really no point in reading this.On top of this, the characters are nowhere near developed or interesting enough to be memorable. The psychological aspect is superficial and left relatively unexplored. And how Alice and her new friend Chase managed to sneak around a mental hospital so much is a complete mystery to me. Do they not have any security measures?This book tries to build a story around a twist that many of us have seen before. The author should have invested more time into creating strong characters and backstory, instead of hoping the climax would be shocking enough to make us forget the rest.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Inge", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6278820-inge", "userReview": "Now that. Was awesome.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming for you, Cellie. Come hell or high water. I\u2019m going to find you. And when I do, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d\n\n(Yes, I absolutely had to do that.)We\u2019ll Never Be Apart is quite the debut novel. From the very first words on the very first page, it had me hooked and even after finishing it, I\u2019m not sure if it has quite let go of me yet. I\u2019m still thinking about what a mad (pun intended) rollercoaster this was, filled with twists and turns, building up and up and up until it finally lets you drop and leaves you reeling with all of the mindfuck.But in a good way.Alice Monroe is stuck at the mental facility in Savage Isle after a brutal attack by her twin sister Cellie, which burned her boyfriend to death and nearly killed her, too. With nothing but a journal to occupy her mind, she\u2019s filled with a terrible rage and only one mission: to find her sister, so she can return the favour. But when she starts writing down her earliest memories, some locked memories race to the surface and leave her reeling with more questions than answers. Nothing is what it seems anymore.\n\u201cShe knew what I was feeling \u2013 that a beam of happiness as soft and shiny as the moonlight had found its way in. She couldn\u2019t wait to carve it out.\u201d\nThis is not a genre I usually read, but it\u2019s always a genre that blows my mind if done well, and this was one of those times. There\u2019s always that uncomfortable, niggling feeling of a thriller set in a mental ward, that something is about to go terribly wrong, and you\u2019re just turning page after page to find out what.Even more unsettling was Cellie \u2013 we know from the beginning that she set fire to the barn Alice and Jason were hiding in. Then, through Alice\u2019s journal, we travel back in time to when Alice and Cellie were youngest. Bit by bit, Cellie grows more unnerving and it becomes clear that something\u2019s not quite right about her. This slow transition into madness was done incredibly well, and with every journal entry I grew more and more disturbed by Cellie\u2019s behaviour until she became downright scary, but in the best possible way.When Alice is not writing in her journal, she\u2019s either in group therapy, individual therapy, or hanging out with Chase Ward. They build a careful friendship based on lie after lie after lie, which you know just won\u2019t end well, but it\u2019s great to see that unique dynamic of a dysfunctional blossoming romance and it\u2019s hard to pinpoint just where it will go. Especially when Chase tries to help Alice come to terms with her past \u2013 things go all kinds of wrong.The book relies heavily on the ending, which can make it or break it for you. Some people had predicted it; I personally didn\u2019t (well, part of it) and that raised the book from a four-star to a five-star-read for me. I thought it was really well done and it made me wonder about the entire book and what I just read.\n\u201cAnd I know, I know, we\u2019ll never be apart.\u201d\nWe\u2019ll Never Be Apart was a quick and thrilling read that left me upside down and wondering about my own sanity.

Disbelief and utter despair run heavy and icy through my veins. Cellie's really done it this time. She's succeeded. She's brought me down.

The story follows her time in a mental ward on Savage Island.If I were to judge this book for it's simple prose it would receive all the stars. I always find that young adult novels hit the sweet spot when it comes to my desire for emotional conviction. That said, I have a major disconnect when it comes to unreliable narrators.

I want more aftermath.\"Don't worry. I won't let them take you away. Where ever you go, I'll go, too.\"\"Do you promise?\" she asked. My answer was easy and automatic.

I had a feeling where it was going and I was right, but it's still so freaking good. You have these twin sisters, Alice & Celia). They live with their grandfather but wake up one day to find him dead. They stayed in the house for a bit of time before they are found out and carted off to different foster homes. In one of these homes they meet Jason. All three of them make a little team and hang out together all of the time. They do some terrible things and one of these things lands the twins on Savage Isle in the mental ward. Jason is going to go to jail. Jason has a brilliant plan to get him and Alice away from the place so they can live out their lives. They are in love and Celia is jealous so she devises a plan to keep her and Alice close and take Jason out of the picture. Alice is telling her story about her and life before the mental hospital through a journal. She writes down all the things that happen with her, Celia, and Jason in it from the day they find their grandfather all the way up until what happens with Jason. Alice is going about her life in the mental hospital at the same time and she meets a really nice boy named Chase there. He tries his best to help her. She has this plan to break into another part of the ward in a different building and face Celia. So many things are going on throughout the book I didn't want to put it down. You just want to get to the end game.

I guessed the \"twist\" in the first few pages and while I enjoyed reading the book, I was disappointed that I had been right about the \"shock\" ending. More than anything I wish that I was wrong; I wish that Emiko Jean didn't go with the obvious ending. If there was a different ending I probably would have been more impressed. The writing was good. It was a very addicting story. I found it hard to put the book down. I wanted to see how the story would play out. I really disliked the \"twist\". It was so predictable. Personally, I think psychological thrillers should make you feel super confused. I think you should be constantly questioning everything the author is saying and then be shocked at the crazy ending OR you should be led to believe something and then BAM, that's not actually true (like Shutter Island). This story was missing that crazy, good psychological thriller element that completely blows your mind. I liked the characters and I liked how they were all done. The pace was quite casual, it wasn't quite as quick and exciting as most of the other thrillers I have read. The plot was okay. It's not a very original concept but overall I think Emiko Jean did a good job with this book. I think Emiko Jean is a very promising author. I think next time Emiko should focus more on developing characters to create a story (because the characters were done quite well) rather than moulding the characters around the story (and that predictable twist). I would read another book by Emiko Jean and I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone. It's just too predictable. * I received an arc from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. *"}, {"userName": "Mlpmom (Book Reviewer)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3829694-mlpmom-book-reviewer", "userReview": "I adore stories where the narrator is unreliable or where things aren't quite what they seem and in We'll Never Be Apart, Jean manages to portray both elements of unreliability and the feeling that you know a twist is coming. That things aren't quite right and at any moment they will turn for the worst. Woven with sly hints and foreshadowing as the story progresses from Alice's point of view to her journal entries, this was done well. Captivating as much as it was interesting, this was a story that I quickly read in a few short hours. And while I did see the ending coming, the twist for what it was, this was still a really fun read that is worthy of the YA mystery thriller title.

I got approved on Edelweiss. I'm going to start it soon! Thank you to Edelweiss and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing for allowing me to read and review We'll Never Be Apart by Emiko Jean. I absolutely loved this book! Initially what drew me to the book was just the plot summary. There's an unreliable narrator set in a mental ward? Fire, revenge, and murder? I'm in! Then when I saw it on Edelweiss something else caught my attention. It said that We'll Never Be Apart was inspired by the author's work with children in foster care. I was really curious to find out how that would show in the novel.We'll Never Be Apart is a YA mystery and psychological thriller. In the novel Alice is committed to a mental ward where she is disturbed my memories of a fire that killed her boyfriend Jason. The fire was started by her twin sister Cellie. Alice befriends another patient, Chase, and she plans revenge against her sister. The novel is written in the present time and also using journal entries to tell the past. In the past there are some hidden truths that Alice needs to figure out. Well first of all I love stories set in mental health facilities. I just find it fascinating to begin with. I also love a good psychological thriller where I'm not sure what the hell is happening or what is real. Sadly, a lot of them are not well done and I can see the \"twist\" from a mile away. We'll Never Be Apart is well done and I did not guess the twist right away. I did guess it early on, but it did take some time and wasn't completely obvious from page one. That is a win in my opinion! The writing throughout is flawless and engaging. I could see in the writing where the author's work with foster children was used, and it seemed to me to be an accurate representation. I enjoyed that aspect of the book a lot. I think this is a brilliant debut novel by Emiko Jean and I can't wait to read more from her.I recommend We'll Never Be Apart to fans of books set in a mental institution and to fans of psychological suspense and mystery/thrillers.

It begins in the snow on the coldest day of the coldest winter of the last fifty years, with two girls on their sixth birthday in silent house. It begins with a body.\u2019\nAlice and Celia are twins who have had an arduous life, but fortunately they\u2019ve had each other to get through it. After their grandfather died when they were six, they\u2019ve bounced around to various different foster care homes, some worse than others. When Alice is seventeen years old, Celia intentionally sets a fire that almost kills her but does kill her boyfriend, Jason. She wakes in a mental health hospital called Savage Isle to find herself recovering from burns and a definite lack of memory surrounding the incident. All Alice knows is Celia killed Jason and revenge begins to consume her thoughts.Honestly, the summary gives it all away and if you didn\u2019t bother to read the summary then the prologue definitely will. Sometimes there\u2019s nothing wrong with a mystery that\u2019s predictable because the story itself can make it all worth it, but I have a hard time becoming sympathetic towards characters and their plights when I know more than they do. Their mental stumbling, trying to uncover obvious clues becomes more obnoxious than tragic.We\u2019ll Never Be Apart could have been saved with some tension but I never felt a sense of urgency from Alice to uncover the mystery. She finds herself in a mental hospital being charged with a crime that she knows in her heart she didn\u2019t commit, yet instead of attempting to work through her memories she becomes resigned to her plight and instead focuses her attention on her crush. Nevermind that her boyfriend of several years just died in a fire a few weeks ago. Becoming resigned to the situation she finds herself in would have been one thing, because can you imagine waking up in a mental hospital being blamed for something you didn\u2019t do and being force-fed medication? That would be terrifying and I think we\u2019d all mentally shut down to some extent, but the focus on the boy was what really ruined it for me. And all the security card stealing so that the two can carouse the halls of the hospital at night. Because that\u2019s totally legit.I kept reading, hoping for a twist that I maybe hadn\u2019t foreseen. Alas, the end came, and it was less twisty and suspenseful than I had been hoping for. The resolution was also far more tidy than I would have expected given the topic. All in all, this one is far from being a terrible read, but I\u2019ve read too many books that touch on the same topic that have just been done better.I received this book free from Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.

And now she's ready to teach Cellie some lessons. She's ready to right some wrongs. Now, it's time for revenge.Cellie was your typical thriller protagonist, nothing more, nothing less. She was confused, full of hatred and a need for vengeance - and rightly so. Reading her journal entries and her thoughts made you feel every bit of her anger and hate and made her extremely easy to connect to.The book's main flaw is how entirely predictable it is. The twist at the ending has been used in so many psychological thrillers lately that it didn't feel extraordinarily shocking to me. I see where Jean was trying to come from, however, and I think the ending will be more effective for those who haven't read many of the thrillers that have been published lately. Yet, luckily, the predictability doesn't deter from its eerie atmosphere and its addicting quality.While it may have been a bit of a far cry away from some of the other more dark and twisted YA thrillers I've read (Dangerous Girls comes to mind instantly), it is still a very suspenseful novel and I'd certainly recommend it to those who haven't read many thrillers."}, {"userName": "Jillian (bookishandnerdy)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3101094-jillian-bookishandnerdy", "userReview": "*3.25 stars*Extremely predictable.

The characters usually lack depth, and they're typically uninteresting, because that author will work so hard to create a great story and plot line, and then they forget to do anything worthwhile with the characters.If you feel that way about a lot of \"thrillers\" that you have read, let me introduce you to We'll Never Be Apart, by debut Emiko Jean.Yes, this is her first novel. How, I have no idea. I had to double check that, because this book made it seem like she's been writing for years. Part of me wishes this were the case, because I absolutely need more books by her. Since there are none, I want to go into hibernation until she writes another.Okay, let's take a look at the book now, shall we?Our story starts off with our main character, Alice, locked up in a mental hospital called Savage Isle. They believe that she started a fire in an abandoned barn that gave her some pretty nasty burns and killed her boyfriend, Jason. Only she knows that her twin sister, Celia, started the fire. Alice finds out that Celia is locked up in the same hospital, in the D ward, which is the ward with the highest security. Since charges are being pressed against her, she is determined to make sure that her sister pays for what she did. While she is in Savage Isle, she meets her roommate, Amelia, who has spiky pink hair and isn't afraid to speak her mind. Amelia and Alice become good friends - eating meals together, sharing secrets, and spending their time together. Alice also meets Chase, a mysterious guy who was recently in the D Ward - and who promises to help Alice find Celia.  So they work together, with Chase stealing key cards to break out of their locked rooms, and while trying to help Alice seek her revenge on Celia, the two form a bond and a relationship that makes Alice feel cared for in a way that she hasn't in a long time.The characters in this book were deep and interesting. Their personalities are fantastic - especially Alice. She and Celia have had a very troubling past together, which is told in Alice's journal entries that she keeps while she is a patient at Savage Isle. These journal entries describe Alice and Celia's troubled childhoods that include going from foster home to foster home, abuse, and Celia and Jason's love for setting fires. As the journal entries continue through each chapter, we learn more and more about how troubled Celia really is, and how Jason isn't the person that Alice thought he was. This really is one of the few books that live up to the name of \"thriller.\" It's exciting from the very first page, and it kept me guessing to the very last.Note: I received an ARC copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Anastasia \uff7c", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753356-anastasia", "userReview": "Full Review on my blog!We\u2019ll Never Be Apart is a riveting psychological thriller from page one.

The cover just grabs you and doesn\u2019t let go.The story revolves around Alice who is now in a mental facility after surviving a fire that her twin sister, Celia, started in an attempt to kill her and her boyfriend Jason, whom sadly did not survive. Alice is recovering and trying to get answers about her life and the events that led up to the fire. Alice is determined to find her twin sister and get revenge for Jason. She tries to come to terms with what her sister Celia did by writing her memories of her bad childhood in a journal. When she realizes that Cellie is in a different ward at the hospital, Alice makes it her mission to find a way to get to her and make her pay by killing her.A piece of Alice\u2019s plan just happens to be a boy she meets in her ward, Chase. He has some demons of his own and as he and Alice become closer, his story is revealed a bit more and he happens to be more than just the cocky troublemaker he presents himself as. Honestly, Alice is the perfect level of sarcastic which I love and her interactions with Chase made me smile. I mean the romance? (Kind of romance-y) between Alice and Chase was cute, but Alice\u2019s constant moaning over Jason kind of ruined it. But when they first met Alice really tried to win him over to help her out with her plan, are some of my favorite interactions between them.

Emiko Jean has written a whirlwind of a novel that will have readers kept in suspense. This novel is very eerie with its mental hospital setting, unique writing style and intense story of vengeance.With its spine-chilling vibe, We\u2019ll Never be Apart is a book that has the ideal backdrop for a fall read. It is set in the creepiest perfect location for a book of this type, a mental hospital. The main character, Alice, is sent to live in a mental ward on Savage Isle (even the name is creepy!) after a fire that was actually set by her sister. Now, this mental hospital isn\u2019t terrifying or filled with ghosts, but it is the perfect venue for something unusual to occur, since there are potential murderers in the building. Jean has created a mood of terror in We\u2019ll Never be Apart that will keep readers in suspense and definitely scared about what\u2019s to happen next.The layout of We\u2019ll Never Be Apart is so noteworthy. Most of the book is told in the present, however at the end of every chapter an entry from Alice\u2019s journal that reveals pieces of her past is incorporated. This is a really interesting technique that surprises the reader and adds many plot twists to the storyline. Also, the story contains a similar format to We Were Liars by E. Lockhart and Damage Done by Amanda Panitch with its suspense and a big information reveal/plot twist at the very end.We\u2019ll Never Be Apart is a story that includes revenge. Books that include the element of sweet vengeance are always engaging for the reader. Alice is angry at her twin sister Cellie for getting her thrown into the mental hospital again and vows to seek revenge. It is enjoyable accompanying Alice on her journey to find her sister, as she is also being closely monitored by the mental hospital. The plot of this book is so rich and contains so many interesting layers of intrigue.The perfect components for an incredible thrill ride are included in Emiko Jean\u2019s We\u2019ll Never Be Apart: a strange mental hospital, journal entries that slowly reveal the past, and a dark revenge story. This is the kind of book that can be read in one sitting, it is that mind-blowing.

I really like the idea of looking up from a character's point of view, so I was interested before I even opened up the cover.The way that debut novelist Emiko Jean takes us through the story of twin sisters Alice and Cellie, commenting subtly on the status of the foster care system in the US, and intertwines a compelling love story shows her mastery of the genre. She has something to say, but doesn't shout it into your ears. She lets it heat up slowly to a boiling point, then right when you think you know what is happening, you are absolutely amazed with how this story unfolds. This is one of the most compelling and suspenseful thrillers that I have ever read. The way that Jean takes us through the satisfying conclusion really impresses and left no questions unanswered and me wanting more.I have read a lot of thrillers, mysteries, and all that I liked were suspenseful- but Jean's debut novel absolutely floored me! I had to go back and re-read the last 100 pages again just to make sure that I read it correctly! When I did, I then went back and re-read the entire story, and LOVED it that much more! This is a book that you uncover additional nuggets every time you read it.Here is what I love about this book. The characters are completely development and grow during the retelling of the story from a past/present story narrative. It has incredible world building, I felt like I was on Savage Isle. It also has a page turning pace that starts of fast, keeps going faster, and sprints all the way through to the compelling ending. MORE PLEASE!!!

It was nothing like what I expected, the prologue is from Cellie's point of view as she starts a fire in the barn which nearly kills Alice and does kill Jason. Chapter one switches to Alice's point of view with her leaving the hospital and being transferred to the mental hospital. While reading I had no idea where the book was going, I couldn't even guess at the resolution of the story. By the end of the book I was shocked, this rarely happens for me, I never thought that the ending that happened was even a possibility.I give this book a 10/10.

An early childhood trauma manifests a multiple personality.2. A later trauma causes the girl to somehow forget everything. She ends up in a psych institute where DOCTORS are for some reason extremely vague and never really try to help her.3. She meets a boy who helps her discover she had invented her sister/twin/best friend (seriously, the twin one is the most overused - note to future YA psychthriller authors- don't do it) and they were the same person all along.4. Escape from hospital occurs, because revisiting the scene of a crime is the only way to bring back repressed memories (seriously, why don't the doctors ever think of this? lol). 5. (much too) Brief final chapter of self realization where girl looks forward to a promising future, is so in love, but also has to let the reader know that she's an independent woman who don't need no man, and always has some strange moment with herself when she decides that her sister/twin/best friend who she invented was a part of her all along, and will be foreva.

Being well written but somewhat predictable, We\u2019ll Never be Apart by Emiko Jean brings forth this dilemma I struggled to resolve before deciding whether to recommend the book. On the one side, the plot Jean crafted is largely dependent upon the big reveal in the last few chapters, a mystery that can be guessed on the very first pages. On the other side, though, the book has plenty going for it along the way, and Emiko Jean\u2019s writing style itself is enough to make this worth our while. Alice and Cellie have a very unusual, co-dependent relationship, even for twins. They adore each other, but Cellie doesn\u2019t allow anyone to get too close to Alice or she becomes extremely violent. Both sisters are obviously troubled, but Alice seems more vulnerable \u2013 until Cellie kills Alice\u2019s boyfriend Jason in a fit of jealousy. We meet Alice in the days following the incident as she struggles to find her footing in a mental ward at Savage Isle. She misses Jason terribly and she\u2019s desperate to find Cellie and exact revenge. Through her diary entries, we also learn more about the girls\u2019 past, the history of Cellie\u2019s behavior and Alice\u2019s desire to protect her. The two have been inseparable their whole lives, through far too many foster homes and several abusive situations. Subtle foreshadowing isn\u2019t one of Emiko Jean\u2019s strengths. Everything that was meant to be a small hint is actually a big neon sign in the reader\u2019s face. It is virtually impossible not to guess the big mystery, but somehow, that doesn\u2019t take away too much from the book\u2019s appeal. The power of this book is in uncovering small details, understanding everyone\u2019s motives and the depth or their madness. Despite her less than subtle approach, Emiko Jean writes well and she knows how to create a creepy atmosphere.All things considered, We\u2019ll Never Be Apart is a decent read, a good choice for readers who enjoy feeling unsettled. Despite being a bit predictable, it\u2019s a good enough book to deserve a few hours of your time."}, {"userName": "Christy LoveOfBooks", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390723-christy-loveofbooks", "userReview": "Okay, here\u2019s the thing \u2026 I knew what was going on after I read the prologue, and almost quit reading because I figured why bother if I already figured it out. I thought it would be another disappointing YA mystery/thriller. Well, luckily I don\u2019t always listen to myself and continued reading, because We\u2019ll Never Be Apart was actually pretty good!This is a quick read that really sucked me in and held my attention once I decided to give it a chance. It was a totally different experience reading it with certain knowledge already, and while I thought that would put a damper on it, it actually turned out that I enjoyed seeing it for what it was and how various situations were handled. So what I initially perceived to be a negative, turned out to be a positive. And I absolutely love how the author wove past and present, forming a bigger picture to unfold the truth.Honestly, Chase is a major reason I continued reading at first. What can I say, I\u2019m a sucker for a guy with a sense of humor and a bit of a rebel streak. And while I had major points of the story figured out, Chase kept me curious as to what his true intentions were.Which brings us to our dear Alice. The girl is locked away in a mental ward facing the possibility of murder charges all thanks to her twin sister. Ah, siblings, right? Alice is determined to exact revenge. I\u2019m surprised how much I enjoyed Alice, and I believe that\u2019s partly to do with what I already knew but can\u2019t say. Ohhh cryptic! No, but seriously, she\u2019s a character that got increasingly interesting as the story progressed.Overall, We\u2019ll Never Be Apart wound up being a pleasant surprise. It may not be the most complex or intense psychological thriller, but it\u2019s still a fun and crazy ride.Dr. Goodman opens group therapy with a poem about acceptance. He then asks us to partner up and talk about acceptance and what that means to us. Of course Chase, my new bestie, turns his chair toward mine, leans back, and crosses his arms. Our knees brush. He assumes we\u2019re going to be partners. He assumes wrong.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like talking today.\u201d I pull out a piece of origami paper and begin to fold.\u201cAnd I accept that,\u201d Chase says. \u201dI knew we\u2019d make a good team.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Beth  (YA Books Central)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5064568-beth-ya-books-central", "userReview": "\"Wherever you go, I'll go too.\"\"Do you promise?\" she asked.\"I promise,\" I said. \"We'll never be apart.\"\nWe'll Never Be Apart is a psychological thriller that will keep you guessing until the very last page. It's a mystery...a thinker...and full of suspense. From the first time I saw the wickedly amazing cover.. I knew I had to read this book. The cover just grabs you and doesn't let go. The story revolves around Alice who is now in a mental facility after surviving a fire that her twin sister, Celia, started in an attempt to kill her and her boyfriend Jason, whom sadly did not survive. Alice is recovering and trying to get answers about her life and the events that led up to the fire. Alice is determined to find her twin sister and get revenge for Jason. Alice meets a young man named Chase while in the hospital and I felt like he helped her to heal and to focus on getting better while searching for the answers she needed. I enjoyed Emiko Jean's writing style because it drew me in immediately and had me captivated with every turn of the page. There were so many questions to be answered and Emiko Jean gives you just enough to keep you reading to the end. There were several reviewers that stated they guessed the ending immediately and they knew what was happening....well I am definitely not one of those reviewers because I had NO idea the twists that were coming and I was literally in SHOCK. I am not even sure what category to place this book in. Its a thriller, mystery, and intense psychological thriller all intertwined into one captivating story and I really enjoyed it. I recommend this book to anyone who reads YA and needs a break from the normal."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18968648-amber", "userReview": "Despite guessing a few major plot points early on, I enjoyed this book.
