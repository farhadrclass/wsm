The story is not about Christmas but about the way in which the short encounters we have with others can last us a lifetime. How lives can change in an instant without any sense of fairness and how, even in the happiest of times, the hardness of life can bring all joy to an abrupt end.It is a story of hope and of the beautiful response some people find in dealing with life\u2019s cruel twists and turns. It is a story that will bring to your mind a thought, \u201cThere but for the grace of God go I\u201d."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10191195-krista", "userReview": "I received this book from my Grandma, Christmas 1996 and have read it every single Christmas Eve since.

Sandy Black is a four year old girl who is the victim of poverty in the small, furniture-manufacturing town...and a victim of the polio epidemic. She loves her older brother, Whitey, and all things angelic--especially a book called The Littlest Angel. Then, right before Christmas, she makes it known that she wants an angel doll for her present. Whitey and his best friend--both ten years old--set out on a mission to get Sandy her doll. The only problem? There are no angel dolls to be had in Thomasville. The boys find the perfect doll and ask the mother of one of their friends if she can help transform an ordinary doll into an angel for Sandy. Through their quest the boys learn the value of friendship and the power of love.This is a moving story that not only tells of the love and sacrifices of two boys during one Christmas, but also shows how the events that year affected them and changed how they would live their lives. While the book is tinged with sadness, it is still a very touching and heartfelt Christmas story.First posted on my blog My Reader's Block. Please request permission before reposting.

This was one of them. It was short and sounded poignant. It was. It is the story of two little boys, age 10, who shared a paper route. One of the boys had a sister who had contracted polio and had an avid interest in angels. Most of all, she liked the story of \"The Littlest Angel.\" Her brother and his friend looked all over their town for an angel doll for her for Christmas. Finally, her brother realized he could buy a regular doll and have it transformed into an angel doll by changing her dress and giving her wings and a halo. They asked one of their other friend's mother who had a sewing machine, if she could help them. Of course she said yes. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that this book sends me back to a different time when life was simpler. There was real love in the boy for his sister and he just wanted to make her happy. The author never mentioned anything the boy wanted for Christmas, just that he wanted an angel doll for his sister. I also like the way all that happened affected the boys in their adult lives. This book does what you expect a Christmas book to do - it reminds you of love and the goodness of people. A nice start to my Christmas reading this year."}, {"userName": "Debbie Maskus", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2486098-debbie-maskus", "userReview": "A short novel, based on an event in a small, rural NC town during Christmas decribes the wonders of Christmas. In this story, Whitey, a poor boy lives with his widowed mother and sick sister. Whitey saves his paper route money to buy his sister an angel doll, but the sister dies before Christmas. The doll ends up in the possession of Whitey's friend, the nameless narrator of the story, who years later discovers that a kindly benefactor donates angel dolls every Christmas to a local children's hospital. Good story to remind a person about what is important."}, {"userName": "Madeleine Reed", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61404151-madeleine-reed", "userReview": "The first time I read this book, I was in the third or fourth grade. I found it in my school library around Christmas and picked it up. I remember sitting on the top of my bunk bed with my little sister and reading it to her by the light of the Christmas lights outside our window. It made me cry back the, and still does today.
