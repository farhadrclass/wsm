It was more weird and goofy than anything else and I just kind of got bored with it and gave it to my little brother, who's probably its more appropriate age demographic, anyway. I did like the characters, they were quirky and unique as usual in the rest of the Beetlejuice legacy, but I think this book was written as a promotional bit of merchandise and wasn't really meant to be more than some quick entertainment."}], "description": "Based on one of the most memorable fantasy characters to appear on TV and movie screens in years, this series is guaranteed to scare readers silly.
