I have read The Jane Austen Book Club, which was also set in the Norcal area, so I'm right at home with that.Update: Just because you get a book for free does not mean you should read it. There was no point or direction to this book. The storyline was very scattered, none of the characters were developed enough to like or emphathize with them, and it was peppered with unnecessary profanity and moral issues that came from left field. The teaser on the front jacket about fans stealing your characters has nothing to do with the book (unless it means \"Thomas Grand\" which I highly doubt).

As someone who spends what, I admit, is probably an inordinate amount of time reading, reading about books is important and informative. Wit\u2019s End is metafiction about mystery. Rima\u2019s godmother, Addison Early, is a successful Agatha Christie\u2014like mystery writer. Rima comes to stay with Addison at Wit\u2019s End, Addison\u2019s little refuge from the world in Santa Cruz. Cut off from the rest of the world by the loss of those closest to her, Rima is adrift. With nowhere to go and nothing to do, she latches on to stray elements from Addison\u2019s past, determined to unearth some sort of mystery to solve.This idea that the detectives in mystery novels have it easy because the author does the hard work of supplying the mystery is perhaps Karen Joy Fowler\u2019s most sublime observation in the entire book. I had never thought of it that way before, but it\u2019s true. Detectives get all the breaks: neat, orderly clues; clear-cut motivations; a nice timeline of events. Real life is much messier than that, and in many cases, as Rima discovers, the nature of the mystery is not clear.Alas, little else about Wit\u2019s End held my attention. Rima herself is a cipher of a character. We never really get close to her. Fowler shares morsels of backstory with a parsimony that I would envy in a science-fiction author. I got the sense that she was never really close to anyone except her late brother. With him they were a dyad; now she is a monad and unsure of how to live.None of the other characters are all that intriguing either. Fowler tries. She alludes to Tilda\u2019s checkered past of homelessness and alcoholism and the struggles reconnecting with her estranged adult son. Addison is supposed to be a kind of ageing grand dame, resplendent in her achievements but worried by the ticking clock on the mantle. Martin is supposed to be \u2026 I don\u2019t know, what passes for a cad these days?Yet all this amounts to is a series of set pieces, and static ones at that. None of the characters change much (not even Rima). I kept expecting Addison to get tetchy when Rima continued to prod Addison\u2019s past and look into Holy City. I kept expecting a fight, or at least an argument\u2014nothing. Aside from that very real, very rewarding moment between Rima and Martin, the emotions in this book are flat. Even when Rima winds out trapped in a house with her \u201cstalker,\u201d Fowler manages to puncture the tension building in the room and replace it with an underwhelming, albeit humourous, resolution.In its attempts to be a character-driven story centred on Rima, Wit\u2019s End fizzles out into a boring book where nothing happens. The promise that this book\u2019s cover copy makes\u2014that this would be about how Addison\u2019s fans have taken over her characters and plotlines\u2014never materializes. There are references to fanfic (especially slashfic) and Wikipedia pages and blog comments, but it\u2019s all ancillary. That would have made for a more interesting story. Still, this is not merely a case of a book misrepresented by its description.I enjoyed the way Fowler uses Addison to share one type of writer\u2019s perspective on readers. But that\u2019s about it. The characters in this book are dull; the plot is largely a collection of unrelated events; as a protagonist, Rima is about as interesting as paint that has very nearly dried. Fowler can do much better, and you, as a reader, can do much better."}, {"userName": "Su", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157205-su", "userReview": "Now this is a really fun book for the modern, Net-savvy reader. I don't think I've ever heard fanfiction discussed more accurately in a book before (or ever discussed period!), and I love the varying attitudes on it from the author to the rabid fangirl to the innocent net surfer who accidentally stumbles onto a slashy one--SO much fun!I read in a professional review somewhere that this book feels \"up to the minute fresh,\" and that is really an excellent way to put it. Blogging, forums, Dubbya's incompetencies, the polar bears on LOST--just little touches like those make the day and place so identifiable and make the story so much more real. If someone in the year 2058 wanted to know what real, day-to-day pop culture and life felt like in the years 2004 - 2008 (at least for liberal, net-savvy and literary intellectuals), this would be the perfect book for him. Since I (and so many of you, my friends) fall into the above category, I think you'll be really tickled by this story and find it a fun read, at the very least.The story isn't all that profound (although the premise is fun--what happens when someone steals your characters, both literally (there is a break-in at the author's house and a rabid fan steals a little model of one of her characters), and figuratively (through fan works, fandom and a reader's personal interpretation and mental \"exchange\" with the characters as they read), but the author's writing style is just AMAZING! SO witty, so sharp and wry and fun, fun, fun--I haven't laughed out loud (there you go, that's in there too) that much while reading a book in years! (not since reading \"Good Omens\" by Tickle-me-Terry Pratchitt!) The setting is really fun, too--an old, Victorian style mansion (once owned by the last surviving member of the Donner Party @_@) in Santa Cruz, CA (which somehow manages to feel both California beachy and rustic/down-to-earth like one of those New England fishing towns where authors go to write). Just a lovely, interesting and fun book for a fun break between summer school reading. As light as I'm making it sound, though, it's not a dumb book--and any aspiring writer should snatch this baby up to experience what REALLY GOOD VOICE/STYLE can do for you.

The description sounded so interesting - A young woman, Rima, who is suffering after the deaths, one after another, of her immediate family members, is invited to move in with her godmother who happens to be a world famous mystery writer. The writer lives in a beachfront estate in Santa Cruz, California, called \"Wit's End\" which was built years ago by a surviving member of the Donner party who is said to haunt the grounds. The writer is a little eccentric - she builds dioramas of the murders she plans to describe in her books, and, since the death of Rima's father, she has not written a new book, but she still maintains a vigil as to what is written about her on the internet. The writer and the father were journalists in Santa Cruz when they were in their 20s, and both had connections to a local cult formed in the 1930s by a crackpot white supremacist who claims to have had the secret to immortality. The writer included Rima's father in one of her novels set in a similar type of cult after which they never spoke again. With nowhere to go and nothing to do, Rima decides take the writer's invitation and to figure out exactly what happened between the writer and her father.Sounds promising, huh? Well, no. I have enjoyed Fowler's other books, so I know she can write, but this book is just too darn precious for its own sake. Every character is just wack-a-doodle, or entirely random. Rima, who has nothing to do all day, takes weeks to read a lousy packet of letters anyone else would have finished in an hour. Each diorama is described in great detail although (spoiler aler... oh , never mind) they have nothing to do with the plot. The 'mystery' is eventually solved, but in such a humdrum manner, and with such ho-hum results, that you wonder why Fowler even bothered. Oh, and if I had to read one more description of the sound of the dachshunds' toenails on the wooden floor, I would have definitely lost my wits....."}, {"userName": "Justwinter", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1238626-justwinter", "userReview": "The best part of this novel is the author's wit. Fowler, as many reviewers note, really does have a wonderful voice. Her character insights, asides, ruminations--all are engaging and interesting. The whole of Wit's End, however, is not as good as the sum of its parts. With so many odd and fascinating side stories: grief, loss, obsessive fan adoration, theft of artistic ownership, cults, mystery novels, mysterious letters, mysteries within mysteries... not to mention complicated and fascinating characters, even down to the dogs in the story--Wit's End was a page turner. But I kept turning back pages due to confusion and the sense I'd just simply 'missed' something. I did have some difficulty tracking 'real' characters and their fictional counterparts--some of this was intentional I'm sure. Yet ultimately I was left puzzled by what I'd read. Was it enjoyable? Yes. But the plotting seemed loose, characters who began with such strong descriptions seemed to fizzle a bit by the end, as did a few of the story lines.I enjoyed the author's humor and thoughtful 'inner voice' descriptions enough to want to try another of her novels--but wonder if I'm simply charmed by her writing style, the dynamic characters she creates--as well as the potential for a terrific tale--and am willing to overlook how well she combines these elements into a fully functional, stand-alone story."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1147841-jackie", "userReview": "The author of The Jane Austen Book Club has struck again--delightfully. This book is not a mystery but it IS about a mystery writer, her goddaughter, and some mysterious past events. There are multiple story lines in this book,including highly imaginative plots for the books written by Addison (though, despite attempts throughout the book by many, not a clue about what the new book is about until the very, very, very end). It's a tad confusing at timessince Addison has a tendency to use \"real\" peoples names for her book characters and similarbutdifferent situations happen to both. I found it an utterly engrossing, charming, chaotic book with a lot of beginnings and no true ending. Every single character in this book is quirky and intriguing.

Karen Joy Fowler's meta-mystery, about a woman trying to decipher the relationships between her family and a famous murder mystery writer, has just as many layers and asks just as many big philosophical questions. Set in a Santa Cruz populated by cults and clowns and 12-stepper housekeepers, the book is as colorful as any traditional mystery. By adding plot lines that take place online (but which have real-world repercussions), Fowler gets nearly sci fi while playing with ideas about doubling, wish fulfillment and even the future of publishing. But it's probably her wit and warmth toward her characters that I like the most."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/290848-john", "userReview": "I'm giving this one three stars, although 2 1/2 would be more accurate. Though Fowler is tremendously good at setting and details, as well as introducing quirky characters, that didn't make up for the \"plot\", such that there is.We start with the protagonist, Rima Lanisell, arriving at the Santa Cruz, CA home of her godmother Addison Early, famous (think: Stephen King famous) author of a serious of mystery/thrillers featuring the character Maxwell Lane, and antagonist Bim Lanisell (Bin Laden?), same name as Rima's deceased father, Pulitzer winning journalist and long ago friend of Addison's; Rima's mother and younger brother Oliver are dead, too, so she's all alone now.After introduction of most of the secondary players, the \"action\" whizzes like a pinball machine, in a random, non-linear manner, among:Rima's flashbacks to her father and brother (mom not that important); present day in Santa Cruz; Rima's dream/fantasy sequences with Maxwell Lane; Addison's flashbacks to her childhood; etc.For me, many of the details failed to make sense, even at the end - such as an abrupt tangent on Addison's having been abducted as a girl (though not abused), and deus-ex-machina retrieval by her father shortly thereafter. Just one long steam of consciousness, in theory held together by the theme of \"identity and belonging\", though that didn't work too well IMHO. The last part of the novel contained the only identifiable plot device: Rima's attempt to solve a burglary at Addison's for which she was (at least partly) responsible.There's also a lot of political diatribe from Addison, which I found heavy-handed, even though I agreed with much of it.In summary - if you find yourself confused early on, it doesn't get any better. Fowler can write alright, but her \"plotting\" isn't for everyone (most?).Bernadette Dunne's outstanding narration played a key role in getting me through to the end of the audiobook."}, {"userName": "Tory", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41751-tory", "userReview": "I really liked it... yet there is no discernible reason that I did.

Karen Joy Fowler's fourth novel appeared in 2004 at the intersection of two massive forces in American publishing: women's book clubs and the Austen revival. With its sharp wit and clever allusions to Emma et al., the story rotated through a year's worth of meetings involving six members of a book club in California. If the plot was a little slow and tenuous, well, nobody minded because Fowler's portrayal of reading-group dynamics was pitch-perfect, and the sprinkling of Austenia made the whole thing sparkle.Her new novel, Wit's End, promises the same kind of bookish delight, and, again, it aims at an enormous segment of the reading market: mystery lovers, who will seize upon this novel like Hercule Poirot upon a bloody candlestick. It's packed with parodic references to the genre's classic conceits and clich\u00bfs, and there's a nod to Austen's own satire of mysteries, Northanger Abbey. But Fowler's real subject this time is the relationship between contemporary writers and their rabid fans.Our heroine is a 29-year-old middle-school teacher in Ohio named Rima, who has a habit of losing things. Among the missing items, Fowler lists \"countless watches, rings, sunglasses, socks, and pens. The keys to the house, the post office box, the car. The car. A book report on Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone plus the library's copy of the book plus her library card. Her mother's dangly turquoise earrings, the phone number of a guy she met playing pool and really, really did want to see again. One passport, one winter coat, four cell phones. One long-term boyfriend. One basically functional family.\"That sly wit, slipping easily between silly and tragic, is Fowler's best quality. Rima's mother died almost 15 years ago, her brother was killed in a car accident, and recently her father passed away. Now alone, lonely and grief-stricken, Rima accepts an invitation to stay with her wealthy godmother in Santa Cruz, Calif. She doesn't know the woman well, but she knows of her. Everyone does. Addison Early is \"The Grande Dame of Murder,\" one of the world's most successful mystery writers. In her 60s and suffering from a long bout of writer's block, she lives in a gorgeous Victorian beach house called \"Wit's End\" that was once owned by a survivor of the Donner Party. The rooms are filled with Addison's famous dollhouses, each a replica of a murder scene that she constructed to plan a different novel, e.g., \" The Box-Top Murders, poison in the breakfast cereal; One of Us, rattler in the medicine chest; and The Widow Reed, weed whacker in the hedges.\"Her famous detective character, Maxwell Lane, lives in the popular imagination with the likes of Sherlock Holmes and Nero Wolfe. He's the subject of Addison's numerous novels, eight movies and three TV series. But Fowler is most interested in Maxwell's active, independent existence in the minds of fanatical readers, the kind of aggressive adoration that's grown exponentially since the advent of the Internet. Addison wages a never-ending battle against intrusions on her privacy, including a series of Wiki-wars conducted on the popular Web encyclopedia, with deletions and additions cycling on ad infinitum. Every possible aspect of Maxwell's life is analyzed on Web sites devoted to the novels, and he's the leading man (sometimes gay, sometimes straight) in an ever-growing collection of stories written by fans for other fans -- a relatively new, legally questionable online genre called fan fiction.Everything about this mystery-soaked set-up promises high entertainment (and high sales), but the biggest riddle of all is why Wit's End is ultimately so unengaging. Some of the problem stems from the fact that the novel has such a muted plot. Soon after Rima arrives to stay with her godmother, a belligerent Maxwell fan barges into the kitchen and darts off with the tiny corpse from one of the dollhouses. Rima determines to solve this miniature crime, but no one else in the book is very interested and, frankly, no one outside of it is likely to be either. Even Rima acknowledges that there's little mystery here. \"Solving the case would give her something to do,\" she thinks, but then wonders, \"What case?\"Soon, she moves on to discovering the nature of her late father's relationship with Addison. This investigation leads her to a defunct cult in which something dastardly may or may not have taken place 50 years ago. Although there's plenty of sensational material here -- charismatic sex-fiend! suicide! murder! -- these events remain distant, not so much mysterious as merely vague, and despite the accumulation of little clues, we're never given much reason to care. Late in the book, Rima seems to acknowledge as much when she admits again, \"There was no case.\"Of course, The Jane Austen Book Club didn't have much plot momentum either, but it overcame that deficiency by sinking deep into the lives of its book club members. In Wit's End, however, except for Rima, the characters are coated with some kind of impenetrable membrane. Addison is obsessive about her privacy. She tells stories that, \"no matter how intimate the content, kept Addison behind glass.\" Tilda \"was Addison's housekeeper unless she was something more,\" a possibility never seriously explored in the novel. And that only leaves the dog-walker, Scorch, who is less interesting than Addison's miniature dachshunds.This comedy of manners isn't without charm; Fowler's subtle humor glides across these pages and enlivens them no matter how dilatory the plot. And her exploration of the creepy relationship between popular authors and their fans in the Internet Age feels up-to-the-minute fresh. But nevertheless a crime has been committed: Long before the end, the novel's life is snuffed out. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/..."}, {"userName": "Kiri Kayrooz", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55503233-kiri-kayrooz", "userReview": "After Rima Lanisell's father dies, she goes to stay with her godmother, Addison Early.

Rima's father, Bim, is both her late father and a character in one of auntie's mysteries.

The characters and the setting were interesting and engrossing. I did think the ending was a tiny bit of a let down, but it's because I didn't really want the story to end. I just wanted it to continue."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2618623-erin", "userReview": "A friend passed this on knowing I read Jane Austen Book Club. I think this had the potential to be good with the plot ideas, but the implementation was not so good.

After suffering personal losses, Rima is adrift and goes to stay with her godmother in Santa Cruz, California. I wasn't quite sure where the story was going. Sometimes it was a mystery, sometimes it was a story about grief, sometimes it was about crazy fans. It was never one thing long enough to hold my attention. When it was over, I wasn't sure what had happened or why I should care about any of the characters. I did like the descriptions of Santa Cruz."}, {"userName": "Victoria Slotto", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5202492-victoria-slotto", "userReview": "I became a fan of Fowler after reading The Jane Austen Book club and then meeting her at a writer's conference. This book fell so short of my expectations. I listened to it on audio, so perhaps my judgment is not fair, but it so totally confused me with its lengthy list of characters, subplots and, I think, even genres. I usually listen to audios twice (during long road trips) since I am more visually oriented, but I don't want to try this again. I can live with not know what the heck really happened."}], "description": "The author of The Jane Austen Book Club presents another highly inventive novel--one that ensnares readers in cunning deceptions, challenging them to separate the truth from fiction.", "title": "Wit's End", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2725134-wit-s-end", "average": 2.73, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1437719454l/2725134.jpg", "reviews": 328, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1448.Karen_Joy_Fowler", "name": "Karen Joy Fowler"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Audiobook", "Womens Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2725134-wit-s-end", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6436140-the-case-of-the-imaginary-detective", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6430647-wit-s-end", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2439325.Wit_s_End", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4459044-the-case-of-the-imaginary-detective", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16176440-we-are-all-completely-beside-ourselves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2152.The_Jane_Austen_Book_Club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119990.Sarah_Canary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119993.Sister_Noon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8130322-what-i-didn-t-see", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
