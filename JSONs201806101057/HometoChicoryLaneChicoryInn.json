Simple as that. I've been reading her books since her very first, A Vow To Cherish and some I've read more than once.In Home To Chicory Lane, Audrey and Grant Whitman have spent most of their retirement funds on turning their home into a bed and breakfast inn. On opening day, they are surprised to see their youngest daughter, a newlywed of 6 months, pulling into the drive way with a U Haul behind her car. What in the world? Have their dreams just went up in a cloud of smoke? Not now, not when they've got everything figured out.Landyn, the Whitmans' daughter, and her husband Chase have a ton of problems and Landyn just ran away from them. Where is Chase? What in the world is really going on?I read this book in less than 24 hours. I just couldn't tear myself away from it. Housework waited, everything waited till I finished. I even read while on the treadmill and stationary bike. Had to. It pulled at me every time I put it down!Deborah Raney has a way of writing that plumbs the absolute depths of human emotion. I don't know how she does it. Well, yes, I do. God gave her this unique ability to write books to bless her readers' hearts. And bless them she does. I was crying my eyes out several times, reading how God's grace and mercy flows to His children.I got to know a wonderful family, who I'm sure I'll get to know even better with the next few books in this series. And what a family they are. I'm very eagerly awaiting the next books, too.What I got from this book is this: God has everything under control, even when we feel like the entire world is in disarray. No matter how frantic we feel at the way things 'seem' to be spiraling out of control, God has it all in His very capable hands. And He has a plan for our lives. A plan that perhaps we can't see because we are so busy looking at the circumstances we see with our natural eyes. Sometimes Jesus just steps into our situations like He did on the Sea of Galilee and says, \"Peace, be still.\" He does that for this family more than once and it is a joy to behold. What a blessing this book was to me. It ministered to me in a situation I'm facing and I'm sure it will to others who read it, too. Deborah Raney is one of a few authors whose books I will always buy just on the strength of her name alone. My only regret is that I'll have to wait so long for the next one!**I was provided an early copy of this book by the publisher, which in no way influenced my review. **"}, {"userName": "Loraine Nunley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17052068-loraine-nunley", "userReview": "What a good start to this series about the Whitman family.

The setting is the beautiful Whitman family home/B &B, located on 50 acres with a creek running through it. There's good character depth and Deborah's prose flows smoothly. A good bit of this story is told from the male perspective, making its appeal reach beyond that of women readers. The first page captured my interest and I'm eager to delve even more into this family's life as the series unfolds.Deborah has a gift for creating realistic characters, and Landyn is kind of hard to like in the beginning. She initially comes across as the spoiled and selfish baby of the family, resenting anyone who tries to tell her what to do, and is willing to walk out on her marriage of six months. Chase, who had been raised by a single mom, was drawn to Landyn's family, yet never felt he measured up in their eyes. I especially enjoy stories about a couple working at their marriage, and Deborah does a great job in showing the problems - insecurity, lack of communication, financial strain - as well as the maturity and growth that comes when love and commitment are in the picture.Chase was almost terrified of being a dad, which made him such a sympathetic character to me. These words express that fear so well: \"The only thing he knew about fathers was that they left town the year you started T-ball, when all the other kids' dads were teaching them how to swing a bat and field a ball. And every few years they promised to come visit and take you to the zoo, or the rodeo, or Disneyland. And then you packed your bag and sat on the front stoop from morning till dark, waiting for an invisible hero who never showed up.\"One theme of Home to Chicory Lane is about seeing the God-given blessings in our lives, for it is so easy for us to focus on the negatives, even as Christians. I loved the road-trip scene where the beautiful hymn, Count Your Blessings, became a springboard for Chase and Landyn to begin putting a name to all that they had. But it was the theme of following God's leading that spoke strongest to me, and all who have struggled with whether what they felt was from God or not can relate to this story. These words spoken by Landyn's grandmother to Chase sum it up well: \"God rarely works in ways that make sense to us while they're happening. All too often, it's only after we look back, sometimes many years later - often, truth be told, peering over heaven's balcony - that we can make sense of the way He was working.\" I enjoyed Home to Chicory Lane very much and recommend it to all who enjoy relationship drama/romance. This is a great beginning to a series that will focus on Grant and Audrey's children, with Corinne & Jesse being featured in the next story, Two Roads Home.Thank you to Litfuse Publicity and Abingdon Press for providing a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Carolyn Vandine west", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31406360-carolyn-vandine-west", "userReview": "Nothing outstanding and memorable but nice quiet read after a few I've had that weren't A great start to a series about family and values they have together.

But we all know that\u2019s not the end. That\u2019s only the beginning, and there\u2019s more to marriage than roses and candlelit dinners. There\u2019s life, and it\u2019s not always happy. Home to Chicory Lane explores this from different perspectives, and it\u2019s good to see fictional characters exploring real issues without it becoming angsty. Audrey and Grant Whitman have spent the last year renovating their family home to turn it into a B&B, and it\u2019s opening weekend. Landyn, the recently-married youngest of their five children, turns up on the doorstep needing a place to stay\u2014she\u2019s left her husband, Cory, because he made a major decision without consulting her\u2014because he was sure God told him to do it.My initial feelings towards Landyn were frustration. Yes, I could see what Cory had done wasn\u2019t good, but immediately running home to Mommy and Daddy didn\u2019t show Landyn in a good light. She came across as selfish and whiney (never attractive qualities), but this was the basis for her personal growth, both as an individual, as a Christian, and as part of a marriage. While I didn\u2019t like her at first, I did by the end, and I could see how the youngest of five could be that way. Home to Chicory Lane did a good job of showing how she learned that there is more to a good marriage than, well, you know.Cory was a good character. He never thought he was good enough, because of his family upbringing, so he had that to deal with, along with a flighty wife. His background meant he felt inferior to the Whitman family, and this came across in the way he interacted with Audrey and especially Grant. Meanwhile, Audrey and Grant had their own issues, with the financial stretch of starting a new business and Landyn\u2019s unexpected arrival. Home to Chicory Lane was a little confusing in the beginning, with Audrey, Grant, five children, spouses and grandchildren. But it soon settled into the main story: Landyn and Cory, and Audrey and Grant. It\u2019s definitely a book written for the Christian market, as there is a central spiritual issue around Cory\u2019s desire to be obedient to God despite Landyn\u2019s uncertainty and frustration. There are a lot of lessons in here for newlyweds, and perhaps those with more established marriages. I\u2019ll look forward to reading future books in the series.Thanks to Abingdon Press and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review.

Audrey has dreamed of turning their three-story home into a Bed & Breakfast and now that the kids have all left home she is finally seeing her dream come true. Her B&B is complete and her first guests are pouring in. But it's soon realized that Audrey's B&B is so much more than a place for weary travelers to lay their heads.This is a book that really draws you into the story and into the lives of each character. I loved Audrey, Grant and all of their kids and extended family. The fact that Deborah Raney used a B&B as the setting was perfect for this story. The Whitman's are a down home family in a small town setting. I believe anyone can relate to the story. The characters dealt with issues that families have to cope with each and every day and the guests of the B&B are like extended family and add a lot to the story. I was, honestly, drawn in from the very first page and I hated to see it end. And, I have to admit, it's not often I read a book that I don't want to end.

Can Audrey still realize her dream and at the same time provide the comfort of home her daughter so desperately needs?My Thoughts: Home To Chicory Lane is the first book in Deborah Raney's newest series, The Chicory Inn and I really enjoyed it. As a fan of Deborah Raney I was excited to have the opportunity to read this latest series. It has been a while since I have read Deborah Raney so it was refreshing to have this opportunity. Audrey Whitman has always dreamed of running a bed and breakfast out of their family home and now with all of they children grown and on their own, Audrey and Grant Whittman put their all into The Chicory Inn, a mile outside of Langhorne,Missouri. The Whittman's have an open house for opening weekend, enlisting help from some of their children. Their youngest Landyn makes a surprise visit from New York hauling a U-Haul truck behind her. When Audrey and Grant finally get to talk to Landyn they find out she has left her husband Chase after he subleased their apartment, moved them into a studio apartment for his art, and he quit his job to be an artist full time. This move would force Landyn to have to quit her job to find something closer. As The Whittman Family circle around Landyn trying to help her make decisions, her husband realizes he needs to be Landyn. Home to Chicory Lane is a great book. I am a huge fan of Deborah Raney and I am so excited that she has a new series out! My dream has been to own a bed and breakfast or resort since I was in high school so this book really spoke to me about having those dreams and making them come true, having the faith to believe this is where God is leading you and trust His calling. So much of this book is about that faith and God's leading and what happens when you listen to that calling. Deborah Raney writes with authority about Missouri, New York, the Art world, marketing,and running a B&B.I really enjoyed meeting the Whittman family, Grant and Audrey, their 5 children, their son in laws, and their grandchildren, oh and Grants Mom CeeCee (there is a story there I hope to read). This book was mainly about Audrey and Grant and Landyn and Chase but it was great to get to learn about the others in the family and the dynamics within their family, which I can't wait to learn more. I found it hard to put this book down once I got into it, wanting to know what would happen with Landyn and Chase. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Contemporary Christian Fiction, you will not be disappointed. I absolutely look forward to the next book in this series (there's a few pages of the new book in this one). I give this book 5 STARS"}, {"userName": "Kathleen (Kat) Smith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328680-kathleen-kat-smith", "userReview": "Even though I've never stayed at a Bed and Breakfast, it has always been something I could dream doing if I simply had a home big enough and support from my husband to give it a go. For best selling author Deborah Raney, she uses this as the setting for her latest series, A Chicory Inn. In the first novel, Home to Chicory Lane, we get a sense for how and why it all started for Audrey and Grant Whitman, who have a sprawling 5500-square foot home on the lushly wooded acres in Langhorne, Missouri. Now that all their children have grown up and begun their own life, it seems silly to have this big old house all to themselves. So rather than sell it off, they decide to forgo the empty nest, and fix it up as a Bed and Breakfast so that they can continue to tradition of taking care of people looking for peace and relaxation while Grant begins retirement to help Audrey in fulfilling her dream. Like all good dreams, Audrey wonders if she can really pull it off. How to get out the word and keep this dream afloat enough to make a living out of it without depleting their savings. However like all great families when you all pull together you can make it work. Yet the one thing they hadn't bet on was their youngest daughter, Landyn arrives home with a U-Haul attached. After only being married for six short months, Landyn is ready to throw in the towel but first she will need to find a way to tell her parents and odds are they aren't likely to be pleased with her reasons and more than likely neither will Chase, once he finds out what she is hiding. Audrey and Grant wonder if they're opening weekend will be a boom or a bust, but with Grant's blood pressure being more than a challenge, he feels this is just what the doctor recommended when he diagnosed a reduction in his stress levels at work. Retiring and helping his wife manage the Inn sounds like a dream in comparison to the rigorous hours at a high pressure job. But how will they be able to help Landyn if all their rooms are booked solid. Where does one send your child when they need help but they can't exactly move back into their childhood home again? I received Home to Chicory Lane by Deborah Raney compliments of Abingdon Press and Litfuse Publicity for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions contained here are strictly my own. This is such a beautiful story about how Grant and Audrey are attempting to solve the dilemmas left when you enter the empty nest chapter of your life and how their experience at whether challenging times in their own marriage will be the foundation that Landyn and Chase will launch their own resolution from. They aren't the pushy parents but want the newly wed couple to be able to see the wisdom that age often brings during challenging times in their own marriage. It's not an easy fix, but in the end it shows how helping our spouse achieve their dreams can be challenging and worth while in the end. Deborah embodies the struggles on both an older and younger married couple so there is truly something the reader can relate to. I easily give this one a 4.5 out of 5 stars and can't wait for the next novel in the series, Two Roads Home which we are given a sneak peek at the conclusion of this one. A readers discussion guide is also included."}, {"userName": "Barbara Shelton", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3884282-barbara-shelton", "userReview": "Empty nesters Audrey and Grant Whitman have raised their five children in a stately home just a mile outside of Langhorne, Missouri. Each book in the Chicory Inn Series will focus on one of their children \u2013 the first being Landyn Whitman Spencer, the baby of the family. This heartwarming story begins with the excitement and tension of opening weekend of the Chicory Inn. It was Audrey\u2019s dream of renovating the home built by her grandparents over a hundred years ago into a bed and breakfast. Her husband Grant, now retired, had been a bit averse to sinking most of his retirement into the project, but did so without grumbling much\u2026 because after all\u2026.Audrey had grown up in this house\u2026and he lovingly gave Audrey her way.The Inn was completely filled by reservations and Audrey was having opening day jitters. It did not help that Corrine arrived toting fussy baby Simone. Simone was teething, and Corrine did not want daddy Jesse to deal with that. Corrine cut in that her dad could watch Simone if need be. Her excuse was irritating to Audrey and she pushed down her resentment, even when Simone wiped her nose on Audrey\u2019s apple green jacket and Corrine laughed saying \u201cWell, at least it matches. \u201c Corrine then dabbed Simone\u2019s nose with a tissue which made her screech like a banshee \u2013 causing the dog Huckleberry to come running and barking. Deborah Raney\u2019s prose is transparent and humorous initiating my attention to be held captive from the first page.Little do Audrey and Grant suspect their stress level has only begun. Daughter Landyn Whitman Chase is pulling a U-Haul trailer from New York City arriving home at an ill-timed moment with no explanation. She does have valid reason \u2013 to herself anyway \u2013 as to why she has come home. Landyn and Chase have been married a mere six months and Chase made a rash decision \u2013 without discussing it with her \u2013 no less. He had let their apartment on the Upper West Side be sublet, rented a fleabag studio apartment in Brooklyn because God was leading him in this way to further his art career. This made no sense to Landyn\u2026she had much to think about \u2013 including a bit of information she was withholding from Chase. I had better stop right here and let you read the story for yourself. Deborah Raney\u2019s plot was well rounded with heartaches to joys. I could identify easily with Audrey as a mother. As I read through the book I could relate to each side of conflicts. If you are ready to laugh and cry, then read this lovely story about family life based on Godly principles. Ms. Raney writes realistic drama with deep feeling and wisdom. This is the first book by Deborah Raney I have read\u2026and it will not be the last. I don\u2019t want to hurry a great writer\u2026.she needs time to develop her stories with aplomb and eloquence. I will be patient and wait\u2026keeping my ears and eyes open for the next novel about the Whitman family.

Thank you Deborah for sharing your gift of writing with all of us and letting us see the many examples of how God moves in our situations and our lives via the Whitman family! I felt like a part of their family! I know the value of coming together as a family and working hard helping those you love when they need you. I cannot wait until the next book comes out!!

I think having the parents' perspective was an interesting way to get some 'outside' views on what Landyn and Chase were going through.I also liked that this story spanned several months' time. Sometimes, in the interest of moving things along, it seems like a resolution is made 'too quickly' in novels.

HOME TO CHICORY LANE  (Chicory Inn #1) By Deborah Raney, is a heartwarming novel of home, family dynamics, relationships, and self-discovery. Audrey and her husband have finally raised their five children, and are opening a bed and breakfast in Langhorne, Missouri\u2014renovating their long time family home and converting it to a business for their retirement.However, the bed and breakfast inn business is not as simple as Audrey thought. In addition, she is the one wanting the business and pretty much has forced her husband into the role (they use the retirement money as he has been in the construction business), and the children are not so keen on their family home being occupied by guests.Taking front and center over the B&B business at hand, is the return of their youngest daughter, Laundry. Laundry (a marketing executive) \u2013only being married for six months to her artist husband, Chase residing in New York. There is trouble in paradise and she is returning home for help.When Laundry shows up unannounced with Uhaul on the day of the open house, Audrey\u2019s perfect world and her open house tour is disrupted. Chase and Laundry have not communicated their feelings to one another, as Chase has grown up with really no family, and no role models. Laundry on the other hand is pretty much spoiled, and wants things her way. (She has much in common with her mother, Audrey who seems very controlling and impulsive, not always looking at the big picture) A starving artist, Chase struggles with doing what he loves; however, at the same time, this family expects him to offer financial security for his family.I am probably not the best judge of this book, since I have been working with B&B and hotel owners for the last 25 years, with their marketing strategy and how to operate a successful inn. I have seen it all, successes and failures. Of course, this book is fiction, so cannot be too critical. Sounds like this couple had no business plan, as no mention of website, property management system, reservation system, marketing plan, competitive analysis, revenue management, etc. There is much more to running a B&B business than laundry and cooking, so was a little unrealistic to have her daughter help with the marketing after the fact (not before). Besides the business of the inn, the novel offers a nice takeaway and lessons for us all, as sometimes God takes us through rough times and puts people in our lives or path for a season or reason. Our struggles may not make sense at the time, or apparent until a later time, when it becomes clear and all the pieces fit together. God always is much bigger than us. Not a lot of likable warm characters you can connect with on an intimate level, except Chase. Seems everyone was forced into being a certain way and nosing into everyone's business, with no humor. I connected with Chase, as know how important it is to follow your dreams and talent, and sympathized with his character. A light Christian read about family dynamics and relationships. Was hoping for a little more from the B&B (the renovations, challenges, guests, etc.), and less from the daughter and son; however, I look forward to reading more from this author in the future.Fans of Sherryl Woods, Debbie Macomber, or Mariah Stewart may enjoy the light read; however, for readers looking for more complex B&B read, would recommend Lin Stepp\u2019s Down By the River, and Donna Ball\u2019s The Hummingbird House and Lady Bug Farm Series."}, {"userName": "Lisa Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7092311-lisa-johnson", "userReview": "Title: Home to Chicory Lane (Book #1: A Chicory Inn Novel)Author: Deborah RaneyPages: 272Year: 2014Publisher: AbingdonAmazon Link: http://www.amazon.com/Home-Chicory-La...Deborah Raney shares with readers a take about a couple who are empty nesters; their five children are grown and a couple of the families with children of their own. Audrey and Grant decide to turn their home into an inn not just as an investment for their later years, but also to fulfill Audrey\u2019s lifelong dream that she hadn\u2019t been able to fill with a large family of her own to raise.Audrey and Grant have three girls and two sons, each have an individual story and a thread of connection as close siblings growing up in what has become a local bed & breakfast. Deborah introduces us to what their children\u2019s adult lives are like at the beginning of the novel; however, this first book centers mainly on Landry as a young newlywed and her husband Chase. Readers will follow the adventure of this very young couple, watching them make mistakes, learn how to be faithful to the Lord and interacting in various scenes in the book.I loved how realistic or lifelike the characters are and how they are created to appear, plus the aspect of learning to lean or depend on God. The parents, Audrey and Grant, were like real parents who love with all their hearts each person in the family even with some of the mistakes they make as a couple. One of the siblings is already in heaven and the family continues to open their hearts to his widow and children. Chase has a newer faith and is learning how to be a man of God along with seeking his wife\u2019s counsel before making decisions. I shake my head at how real the whole story felt as I read. The fact the characters have flaws and not perfect made the tale easier to picture in my imagination. So impressed letting readers see how each couple expresses love, faith, and how important family time is by not letting the inn business or any other activity take away that special family time around the dinner table at least one time a week. During various intersections of the story, I felt as if I was remembering my own upbringing and the family celebrations we had over the years with good memories.Don\u2019t miss Home to Chicory Lane because the story is just beginning!

Audrey and Grant have recently seen their fifth and last child, Landyn, married. Now they are focusing on Audrey's deferred dream of turning their lovely old home into a guest house. On opening day, Landyn turns up towing a whole lot of furniture. She's left her husband, Chase, after six months, because he made a spur-of-the-moment decision about where they were to live without waiting to ask her input. And Landyn has never taken kindly to being told what to do.The story turns into a comedy of errors at times, as they all try to work things out. There are four main characters; the father, the mother, the daughter and the son-in-law. What I like about this book is the realism, showing that nobody's life will ever look picture perfect. Even when you're living your best dream, there will always be a certain amount of messiness, mundane and less than ideal situations to contend with, so we might as well get used to it. Marriage, raising families and working weren't designed to be a piece of cake, and we get along best when we don't expect them to be.The characters match the plot with their mixtures of great and annoying personality traits. Audrey may place making a good impression on strangers above being a caring parent and easy-going grandparent at times, but she still gives her daughter the wise advice that when you allow your spouse to pursue their dreams, you must do it with no strings attached. Grant has some prejudices and fixed ideas about how the younger generation should behave, but to his credit, he bites his tongue and lets Chase and Landyn make their own decisions. Landyn has a headstrong and secretive streak, making trouble for herself by asking her parents to keep things from her husband and vice versa, but she genuinely loves the significant people in her life.It was harder to come up with Chase's bad points, as he was my favourite character. If anything, it would have to be insecurity and lack of confidence. I love the way he reasons that God made him an artist, and it's not his fault if society makes it almost impossible to make a living as one. Like many of us, a lot of Chase's anxiety comes from financial burdens, reminding me of the saying, 'The best things in life are free, but the second best things are very expensive.' I appreciated his depressed musing that he wasn't hearing from God while he made an important decision, even though he was certain he was. The answer given to him (and us) to ponder comes from a minor character, Grandma Cece, who reasons that God's ways rarely make sense to us while they're happening, but we may see their significance some time down the track.Although this book was a quick and easy read on the surface, the undercurrents kept me thinking for a while.Thanks to Net Galley and Abingdon Press for my review copy."}], "description": "Audrey Whitman's dreams are coming true.
