It's an achievement that the author has made a story of grand intrigue, privateers and slavery quite so flat and boring. Avoid!"}, {"userName": "Ralph", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9643466-ralph", "userReview": "\"Armada\" is a well-written, well-plotted historical novel, populated with fully fleshed characters both plucked from the pages of history and fashioned by the author's fecund imagination. More importantly, though, the book is well researched, is filled with the nuances of everyday life in another age, and does not appear to sacrifice much (if any) historical fact for the sake of a good rousing tale. \"Armada\" is set during the Elizabethan Era, when Spain and England were implacable enemies, as much the result of competition for world domination and New World gold as it was sexual tension and religious differences between Spain's Phillip and England's \"Virgin Queen.\" Two brothers are set upon different paths by an event well documented in the historical records, one returning to England, the other, a master cannon-maker, being captured by the Spanish. Author Robert Carter does an excellent job in weaving his fictional tale through the life of notorious real-life English hero Sir Francis Drake and the events which led to the defeat of the Spanish Armada. The narrative voice is authoritative and driving, pulling the reader into a long-lost world of exciting adventure and dark intrigues; the dialogue retains an authentic ring, true to the times without being incomprehensible to the modern reader. Dangerous journeys, exciting sea battles, political conspiracies, personal tragedy, historical verisimilitude, and great writing -- \"Armada\" will appeal to fans of historical fiction, adventure novels, nautical tales, and students of Elizabethan history."}], "description": "Forget Captain Sparrow!
