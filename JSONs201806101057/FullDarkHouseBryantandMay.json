That's Peculiar Crimes Division. At least they were, until a bomb goes off and ends their partnership. While May copes with his loss and tries to piece together what happened to Arthur, he thinks about their first case and how the two events may be related.I never thought I'd enjoy a book about the partnership of two crotchedy British detectives so much. The primary setting, a old theatre during the WWII bombing of London, was well done. Bryant and May are contrasting characters ala Mulder and Scully of the X-Files, except British and both male. Bryant tends to go off on tangents and the straight-laced May has to reign him in. The supporting PCU members are also well done. Forthright and Biddle are good characters in their own right.While the present day case was solveable, the WWII one wasn't, although I can't complain. The lead up to the reveal was strewn with red herrings.If you like crime stories and your sense of humor tingles with delight at the thought of two eighty year old men discussing their sex drives on page 10, give this one a chance. You could do a lot worse."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5240149-brenda", "userReview": "This book was a tedious read for me. The plot got too bogged down with descriptions in hope of building an atmosphere. London during the Blitz was interesting, but the interior of the theatre was not. The investigators Arthur Bryant and John May didn\u2019t connect with me, whether it was in 1940 when they were aged 19 and 22 or in 2003 when they were in their 80's. The secondary characters, especially those in the theatre, just made me sad. I reviewed the first few pages of the second book in the series. The writer's style continues, so I won\u2019t pursue the series any further."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "This is the first of the series featuring Arthur Bryant and John May, of the Peculiar Crimes Unit in London. The book begins in the present, with an explosion in the offices, and Arthur Bryant inside. The Unit opened in 1939 and, recently, May was aware that Bryant had been writing his memoirs and writing up his first case. This leads him to try to track down who was responsible for the destruction of the office, as well as coming to terms with losing his partner.In this book, we are taken back to the blitz and Bryant and May\u2019s first case; a series of strange deaths in a London theatre. Although the book switches from the present to the past, most of the book is set in 1940 London and the author obviously has a great deal of love for both London and an eye for detail. There is a lot of background information about the theatre, and a real sense of menace and danger in the darkened theatre, as well as the fact that London, and our heroes, are trying to do their jobs while London is being mercilessly bombed. This is a series that I have meant to try for a long time and I am pleased that I finally got around to trying it. I liked the wartime setting and, although I found the plot a little unrealistic (well, it is meant to be the \u2018Peculiar Crimes Unit\u2019 I suppose), I did really like the characters. I would certainly read the next in the series and suspect that the books will get better, once it has settled down.

Does that sound like a Scooby Doo episode, or is it just me? \u201cI\u2019d have gotten away with it if it wasn\u2019t for you meddling kids!\u201d Or in this case, meddling English detectives instead of talking dogs and damn dirty hippies.Actually, this was a pretty dark and well done mystery with an intriguing concept and structure. Arthur Bryant and John May have been detectives for London\u2019s Peculiar Crime Unit for over 60 years. However, when Bryant is killed in a bomb blast that destroys their offices, the clues May follows indicate that Bryant was looking into their first case together. In 1940, a string of grisly and bizarre murders are occurring in a theater getting ready to launch a controversial production. Since the rest of England is slightly busy dealing with the Blitz and the imminent invasion of the island by Germany, the case is pawned off onto the PCU and its understaffed group of under aged and inexperienced detectives. Brilliant but eccentric Bryant thinks that normal police methods won\u2019t solve the crime while the more practical May tries to keep Bryant from venturing too far away from plausible explanations. In the present day, elderly John May tries to solve the murder of his friend.The parallel stories of Bryant and May in 1940, and May\u2019s investigation in the present was a great idea. And setting a murder mystery against the London Blitz is another terrific concept. More than one person notes that it seems slightly ridiculous to worry about a couple of murders when hundreds are being killed every night. But the British government wants a sense of calm and normalcy so it still frowns on someone offing their citizens. Even if they are just actors\u2026A good mystery with a dark sense of humor and an original setting, this was a fun read. My only real complaint is that as a native of Kansas City, the name Arthur Bryant is the name of a barbecue legend, restaurant and sauce here. So every time I read the name in this book, I instantly craved some beef brisket.

I just re-imagine them with the materials of the present.\" Full Dark House captures my favorite aspects of my \"childhood\" mysteries-Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie, especially come to mind, dressed up in very contemporary dark humor and time manipulation.Although not the first I've read, Full Dark House is the first in Fowler's Bryant and May detective series. Bryant and May are two elderly detectives-one charming, one not-who head London's \"Peculiar Crime Units\" and Full Dark House tells the story of their first case in flashback. The book begins with the bombing of the theater which was the site of their first case and the killing of Bryant. As his partner and friend tries to solve the mystery of the current day bombing, he is forced to relieve and rethink their first case.Although it dragged at some points, on the whole, Full Dark House (a reference to the theatrical production that is its setting) is a lovely and satisfying read."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "If I had to classify this novel in terms of genre, it would be somewhere along the lines of British police procedural meets the X-files. I was thinking while I was reading this that it would make a fun movie, but I countered that thought with the knowledge that some screenwriter would just screw it up, so better to leave it in book format. What a cool book! I originally bought this book in mass market paperback format eons ago, but never got around to reading it until I saw the same book in trade paper size (which I really prefer), and I pounced on it. I picked it up last night and didn't look back until I finished it this morning. If that's not a recommendation, I don't know what is.brief summary; no spoilers here: Arthur Bryant, a most eccentric partner in detection of John May, was revisiting the pair's first case together some 60 years later, and the lab he was working was blown to kingdom come, taking Bryant with it. John May, of course, whose friendship with Bryant has lasted throughout their career as detectives in the Peculiar Crimes Unit (started during the Blitz in London), is devastated, and realizes that to solve the case of Bryant's death, he has to go back in time to re-examine their first case, since that was what Bryant was working on. It turns out that this case involved a very bizarre production of Orpheus in the Underworld, complete with can-can and high French knickers by the dancers at the end. They were assigned to the case when a pair of feet were discovered on the charcoal brazier of a Turkish street vendor - leading them to the death of a dancer in the theater staging the production. After that, the show was plagued with problems that required special assistance from the Peculiar Crimes Unit -- for example, a medium whose cat channeled the spirit of a dead pilot, along with other, shall we say, more unorthodox methodologies of crime solving. But back to the future: May will not rest until he solves Bryant's death, so he tries to put the missing pieces together to do so. The book weaves both past and present together to get to the root of the modern-day tragedy, and does it well by examining the original case back at the time of the Blitz. The characters, however, make this novel what it is. Bryant and May are very well suited to each other, and the rest of the characters are not droll toadies relegated to the background, but have lives of their own here. I'm very big on the use of place & setting as a character of its own within a novel, and here Fowler has done that -- the darkness of blacked-out London during the bombings has its own personality. Fowler's descriptions of how people coped and how society worked during the Blitz was also very well done.I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes British mysteries, and to people who like mystery spiced with a bit of the fantastic & paranormal, but done so in a way that doesn't turn silly and take you off on ridiculous tangents. I already know I'm going to really enjoy this series and can't wait to get to the others."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1761558-sara", "userReview": "There were two quotes on the back of the paperback copy of Full Dark House  I picked up that caught my attention: \"A madcap mystery...\" and \"How many locked-room puzzles can the duo unlock...\" My kind of book; or so I thought.Not only is there no locked room (the detectives took another character's word for it on that one) it wasn't terribly madcap either. Nor was the plot original; yes, folks, it's another \"reinterpretation\" of that famous Gaston Leroux novel, The Phantom of the Opera.

The explosion occurred at daybreak on the second Tuesday morning of September, its shock waves rippling through the beer-stained streets of Mornington Crescent. It detonated car alarms, hurled house bricks across the street, blew a chimney stack forty feet into the sky, ruptured the eardrums of several tramps, denuded over two dozen pigeons, catapulted a surprised ginger tom through the window of a kebab shop and fired several roofing tiles into the forehead of the Pope, who was featured on a poster for condoms opposite the tube station.\nIt's certainly a brilliant opening. A bomb in modern London kills Arthur Bryant, the octogenarian senior partner in the detective team of Bryant and May (yes, like the English matches), bringing to an end their six-decade association in the Peculiar Crimes Unit. And this takes the surviving partner, John May, back to their first case together, a series of grisly murders in London\u2019s Palace Theatre during the worst year of the Blitz. Unusually for the first book in a long series, author Christopher Fowler sets out to solve the first crime\u2014and the last.The Goodreads friend who recommended this series praised Fowler for his uncanny knowledge of London then and now, and his ability to take the reader into strange corners and situations. And my friend is absolutely right; Fowler knows the city, and has his feet on its ground; he is at his best when he keeps them there. His descriptions of wartime London ring totally true, and I found myself trusting him, especially in the earlier period.I also had hopes for the setting. The Palace is a real theater, home to many of the big musicals such as Les Mis\u00e9rables, The Sound of Music when I was young, and many famous names before and since. In the novel, they are rehearsing an elaborate and somewhat risqu\u00e9 revival of Offenbach\u2019s Orpheus in the Underworld. A light opera, certainly, but still opera, and thus in my professional world as an opera director; I should have been in my element. Fowler is excellent at describing the physical building, and he has fun with many of the personalities, such as the domineering director:\nHelena Parole had a handshake like a pair of mole grips and a smile so false she could have stood for Parliament. 'Thank you so much for taking the time to come down and see us,' she told May, as though she had requested his attendance for an audition. Her vocal cords had been gymnastically regraded to dramatize her speech, so that her every remark emerged as a declaration. May felt the hairs on the back of his neck bristle with resentment.\nHowever, I came to realize that my professional knowledge made me less, not more, suited as a reader. There was too much that was not quite right. Like so many detective writers, Fowler seems engaged in building up a cast of colorful characters, and treats the inbred nature of the theater world as license to take this even farther, creating types rather than working professionals, regular human beings. And when the story began to hint at elements of the supernatural, in the manner of Phantom of the Opera, or international conspiracies in the manner of Dan Brown, I felt Fowler was losing his best quality, the ability to keep his feet on solid ground. A little over halfway through, I suddenly asked myself, \"Do I care to know who has committed these murders, or what happens to all these people?\" And the answer was that I didn\u2019t, so I stopped."}, {"userName": "Veronica ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7035111-veronica", "userReview": "There was too much that was vague about this story for me to rate it any higher. The chapters shift between the present (the book was published in 2003) when Arthur Bryant and John May are both in their eighties and 1940 when they're working their first case together as members of the Peculiar Crimes Unit. The problem is that, when it comes to the relationships and the investigation of multiple murders, there is too much telling and not enough showing. For the investigation things are suddenly announced as fact and we're told that the information was discovered and/or relayed to others off the page, thus denying the reader the chance to discover clues along with the characters. For the relationships, well the most important one is the 60+ year friendship between Bryant and May but when we first meet them in the 1940 flashback chapters we're never really given any solid foundation for why May inherently trusts Bryant's instincts or why Bryant feels so despondent that May doesn't have faith in him...after only three days of knowing each other (and if you're wondering about the seeming contradiction in that, there is plenty of stuff like that in the book too). It's not like we're shown them having deep, personal conversations or surviving a tragedy together. They felt more like the cliff notes to friendship. The cover was nice as was Bryant's sense of humor but, unfortunately, neither really translates into further reading of this series."}, {"userName": "Marwan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49765318-marwan", "userReview": "Well, this Crime Fiction was better than I thought it'd be, I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't too long and too detailed. But it's to be expected since it's a historical fiction also. The novel is the first in the series that revolves around the adventures of Arthur Bryant and John May in the peculiar crime squad unit. It focus on the first case they worked on together during the world war 2. It's about a series of murders that occurs in the Palace theater, a murderer who moves swiftly and mange to get way easily like a phantom (Phantom of the Opera XD). They manged to solve the case and the murderer was assumed to be killed during the pursuit. However, 60 years later, when a bomb obliterates the peculiar crime unit building and Arthur Bryant was the only one in the building. John May suspects something is wrong, further digging reveals that Arthur was re-investigating their first case, and the killer might be still alive after all. It's up to John to find the truth and avenge his old friend and partner.The story keeps swapping between the past and present which what I like most about.

Too dark for my current reading needs, which took it down a star subjectively, but well written, which added a star objectively. Quirky and eccentric without being cozy.Written in omniscient, with parallel tales taking place in two times -- Detectives Bryant and May's first case, occurring during the London Blitz, and their last, in the early 21st Century. The omniscient voice allows some interesting effects as the tale not only alternates eras q.s. by chapter units, but adds illuminating asides in lines and paragraphs jumping back and forth in time summing up assorted bits of intervening information which helps stitch the parts together. Which a writer can do in omniscient, but not in tight third. While I find omniscient more emotionally distancing than tight third, no question one can get good breadth out of it, properly handled.Someone is knocking off cast members of a lurid production of the operetta Orpheus while German bombs fall on London, and the newbie detectives must pursue justice for the few inside the labyrinthine building while thousands are dying outside; this part is a pretty good historical novel, among other things. 60 years later, something from that first case comes back to haunt the aged pair.For whatever reason, I seem to be running across a slew of recent British works that appear to want to recapture an older generation, or something from it that is now missed -- not only this, but the TV series New Tricks, and the character of Detective Inspector Nightingale from Ben Aaronovitch's Rivers of London series. Is this a Thing in Britain at the moment? Or just an artifact of my own selections?The tale starts dark and gets darker, but lightens up toward the end, rewarding the persistent reader. The grimdark almost lost me about a third through, but I peeked at the end for reassurance that I was not to be perpetually punished for my reading efforts, and slogged on. Destroyed the puzzle aspect of the tale, a disservice I suppose, but I don't read mysteries for the puzzles, but rather, for the characters and sometimes settings, which here held my interest fairly well. I might follow up sometime just to see what the writer does with this setup.Ta, L."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew", "userReview": "Ah I have finally finished it - I will have to hold my hand up and apologise this book took far too long to read and that should in no way reflect on the quality of the story or abilities of Christopher Fowler - nope this one sits with me. A mixture of bad timing (I was reading it as I was preparing to head to the US on business) and the fact I am shallow and was easily distracted by other books to read at the same time.But what of the book! Well this if I remember correctly (go on correct me) was the start of the official series of Bryant and May of the Peculiar Crime squad. Now this is not to say the first time we have seen them in print (or in fact I have read them in print) they have appeared in earlier works but they never quite satisfied Mr Fowler. So to correct this he decided to start again - re-writing and tidying up their history and in the case of the book The Darkest Day totally rewriting the book itself. So here we have their first case - and without giving away spoilers it does an excellent job of telling us of their first case together and what appears to be their last. It introduces us to London during the blitz and to London in general. Now I have said many times that I do love an authentic London based story and Christopher Fowler cannot get more authentic (its not about snobbery I just hate seeing locations I have visited and wander around poorly represented). It also prepares us for the relationship that comes from working together for so long together, the banter the thought processes and the camaraderie that has developed because of it.The series is as far as I can see still going strong with new titles being added to it all the time. And for me there is still the hint of the fantastical (the White Witch of London?) as well as sheer detective work and drama. Christopher Fowler has the ability of turning his hand to many genres and I have still to find one he has failed at.

In between, there are some flamboyant theatrical deaths\u2026shades of Phantom of the Opera(!)\u2026and a contradictory partnership of the offputting Bryant and the more level, realistic, and diplomatic May.It\u2019s that theatre case in 1940 that finds Arthur going off the deep end and is connected to the event of Arthur\u2019s death which allows May to reminisce about past cases \u2014 a brilliant way of dumping information on us. It\u2019s also a great way to introduce Bryant\u2019s fascination with the occult and his fantastic imagination.The \u201ctime travel\u201d can be a touch confusing as Fowler flips back and forth between today\u2019s investigation into Bryant\u2019s death to May\u2019s introspection about their first case together at the Palace Theatre, the progression of which causes Bryant to compare the PCU to Orpheus, \u201crushing headlong into the light of a terrible new world\u201d.You\u2019ll learn some interesting tidbits about how Londoners coped with the blitz, such as leaving your white shirttail hanging out when on a bike, so motorists can see you during a blackout, sandbag substitutes, the concern for morale, and the food shortage problems. For the prurient, Fowler explains the \u201cexcitement\u201d of the cancan, lol. What he calls \u201ca real trouser rouser\u201d\u2026*laughing*\u2026 Fowler also has a lovely explanation of what\u2019s behind the thinking on Offenbach\u2019s Orpheus. Makes me want to the original tale and the opera myself.Fowler helps create a more fearful atmosphere with the terrible situation for the theatrical people: the fear of the bombings combined with the fear of who is killing them off.It\u2019s complex and twisting and found me re-reading sections to get the gist, but very well worth reading. You will CRACK up when you get to the end. It\u2019s so Bryant, ROFL. To call Bryant eccentric is to lowball the guy. He\u2019s a danger to technology and stuffed shirts.Hmm, Fowler never does explain that flute note.I\u2019m eager to see how Fowler continues in \nThe Water Room\n since we\u2019ve had the beginning and the (possible) end already.The StoryA bomb rips through present-day London, tragically ending the crime-fighting partnership of Arthur Bryant and John May begun more than a half-century ago during another infamous bombing: the Blitz of World War II.Desperately searching for clues to the saboteur\u2019s identity, May finds the notes his old friend kept of their very first case and a past that may have returned\u2026with murderous vengeance.It was an investigation that began with the grisly murder of a pretty young dancer. In a city shaken by war, a faceless killer stalked London\u2019s theatre row, creating his own sinister drama. And it would take Bryant\u2019s unorthodox techniques and May\u2019s dogged police work to catch a fiend whose ability to escape detection seemed almost supernatural \u2014 a murderer who decades later may have returned to kill one of them\u2026and won\u2019t stop until he kills the other.The CharactersBryant and May can be found in both times.\nSeptember 2000 London\nDetective Arthur Bryant died in a bomb blast that took out the office. Just as he and May were about to retire. His partner, Detective John May, is the level-headed one. Detective Sergeant Janice Longbright has just retired. Liberty DuCaine is part of the forensic unit.

Sidney Biddle is the officious, by-the-book spy planted on Bryant by their boss, Superintendent Farley Davenport, who is completely against the Peculiar Crimes Unit. Arthur Bryant (he has a dicky heart) and firmly believes in outside-the-box thinking, an iconoclast, with a true belief in the paranormal. I suspect it\u2019s partly why he has such a difficult time with the opposite sex. Not a problem that May has. The eighteen-year-old Nathalie was the love of Bryant\u2019s life.\u201dA Holborn judge \u2026 refused to hear any more from the unit\u2019s witnesses until Bryant could assure him that they were all technically alive and in human form.\u201dJohn May had codebreaking training and this is his first day on the job; he\u2019s the diplomat who keeps a rein on Bryant\u2019s more excessive imaginings.

We're the police, we don't thump people.'\" Ah yes, those were the days. It's an interesting choice for Fowler to begin his book about a partnership of detectives at the tail ends of their lives and possibly their said partnership. All of the bits set in the present day never really clicked for me, suffering in comparison to Bryant and May's investigation of a series of murders in a theater before and during the staging of a play against the backdrop of the horrors of the Blitz. There's just so much potential in this, but the funny bits concur very uneasily with all of the murdering in a way that reminds me a lot of the first Maggie Hope mystery, where people where bantering & bickering humorously in one scene & then someone was getting tortured with a hot poker in the next. Also, the killer reveal is flat out ridiculous. Color me a total sucker for detectives + magic, so I am making an even more curious choice to continue with this series even though I mostly disliked this book, so here's to the realization of potential."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/99747-chris", "userReview": "You're either going to love or loathe this book about a British detective in his 80s who finds himself revisiting the first case he worked on (60 years ago) with his partner in the Peculiar Crimes Unit.

While the PCU specializes in using unusual methods to solve their anything but routine cases, to simply call Bryant and May off-beat would be unfair. Fowler uses clever plots, dark humor, and a memorable supporting cast to tell his stories. The fact that Bthe main characters have been at their jobs since the early 1940s, putting both comfortably in their 80s, only adds to the charm. The author is clearly very fond of London and the City is as much a character as the detectives themselves. My wife and I recently traveled to the UK and we were able to visit many of the settings used in the series, including a memorable sunset at Waterloo Bridge.

What I liked most about this story was the camaraderie and humor between the partners. There were quite a few places that gave me a good laugh.

In present day London, an incendiary device is set off in the office of London Metropolitan Police\u2019s Peculiar Crimes Unit, which not only destroys their police files but kills Arthur Bryant, one half of a detective double, Bryant and May. The surviving detective John May is now on the hunt for a cop killer. Whilst investigating, May becomes convinced that the killer is connected to the two\u2019s first case together, one that began in London\u2019s Blitz of the 1940\u2019s.Much of the book then goes back to that time to give details of the case: a strange one, involving a footless dancer\u2019s body, a death by globe and a faceless man running around a theatre in a Blitz-damaged London, before May can deduce any connection between the past and the present.Though I\u2019ve seen this series around for a while now (and as I type we\u2019re about to get Book 10 in the series) I must admit that, frankly, it\u2019s passed me by.Really, I should have known better. It\u2019s a witty, clever little book, written with panache and humour, whilst using Christopher\u2019s horror origins to throw in the odd little shock as we veer slightly into Twilight Zone or X-Files territory. The characters are great (although a little rude in places, so they might shock your typical crime fan) and the setting, both in the past and the present, wholly immersive. The suspects all appear as identifiable as in a game of Cluedo or an Agatha Christie novel, and it\u2019s great fun trying to work out whodunnit. The details of their first case together for the Peculiar Crimes Squad, set in 1940\u2019s Blitz-hit London are wonderfully well written. As richly detailed as Connie Willis\u2019s recent Blackout/All Clear, there\u2019s a palpable sense of being in the city whilst there\u2019s rationing and a war on. With none of the technical gubbins of today\u2019s detectives, Bryant and May have to use good, old-fashioned deduction to make their conclusions work. A knowledge of Ancient Greek mythology is quite useful here. That, and a little understanding of the occult that wouldn\u2019t go amiss from a pulp-fiction 1930\u2019s tale. The overall feeling at the end of this one is that it is a combination of a traditional British crime thriller with a touch of the Phantom of the Opera about it. As the deaths continue at the London theatre, the cause seems almost supernatural. Christopher, showing his Horror origins, can\u2019t resist some quite gory deaths along the way.I\u2019m sure some readers will be struck by how such tales have recently struck a popular chord. Treading similar ground (or is that a policeman\u2019s beat?) to Ben Aaronovitch\u2019s recent Rivers of London/Peter Grant novels, I must say that as much as I enjoyed Ben\u2019s first novel, I enjoyed this one much, much more. Full Dark House is a more subtle tale, cleverer in its plot twists, sexier and more stylish, although less genre related, perhaps. Full Dark House is not a book that tries to repeatedly show the reader explicitly how clever it is: it just is, and it is up to the reader to find the clues out. As \u2018whodunnits\u2019 go, this is a classy effort. The little touches, as literary Easter Eggs, kept me amused throughout: Bryant and May are the brand name for a British box of matches, for example.For people wanting to read something in my opinion as good, if not better (and written nearly a decade before) than Ben\u2019s books, this comes very much recommended. Why didn\u2019t readers (including me) notice this one before? This would make a wonderful BBC Television series.I struggled to put this one down. Guess that means I\u2019m a newly converted fan and can\u2019t wait to read more.Nine more to go and find.

Basically, Fowler is a bit more serious - the same recognisably British comic tone hovers under the surface, but never becomes cheeky or flippant, befitting protagonists about sixty years Grant's senior. And as a friend advised, not as much magic: this is something closer to a straight historical procedural. It's also considerably more 'literary' in its writing than the Scandinavian series I've been reading recently.I found Full Dark House deeply atmospheric at the start. Whilst they're young enough to be my oldest grandfather's sons, B&M seem part of, imbued with, ancient strata of London history. Nothing especially mystical is evoked in references, it's something more mysterious in the tone of the writing as it's quite clear that their first case started here, 1940, in a theatre. An evocative world of its own that calls up the spirits of The Red Shoes, An Awfully Big Adventure, Tony Richardson's The Entertainer and every other 50s and 60s film that was unfashionably nostalgic for the lost world of variety. (Phantom of the Opera is the most obvious reference, but due to a childhood dislike of Michael Crawford, I never wanted anything to do with that story in any medium.) Flipping between then and now in short chapters gives a spine tingling, stomach-churning sense of a favourite subject, the passing of time and all of its... What a long way it is from those to a present where B&M's colleagues and successors have the more immediate priority of confiscating Chinese-made assault rifles from the hands of drug addled teenage yardie wannabes.And Fowler understands how even a place as large as London can become fused in one's mind with a personality: \"'I have to get out of London.'Finch understood. Arthur Bryant was virtually a symbol of the city. There were memories of the man and his cases almost everywhere you looked.\"Somehow, gradually, the story doesn't quite live up to the mystique of the setup. Perhaps it's a bit too long and detailed. Perhaps the structure of short chapters - ideal for public transport reading - is disjointed used with a story that's only engrossing when you spend at least half an hour at a time on it. Perhaps it was the disorientating mixture of immersive historical attitude and ill-suited modernity in the Forties' characters. Perhaps it's the 'show don't tell' chestnut as far as character traits are concerned. It plodded at times, people weren't as vivid as they could be. There's unnecessary detail at times; nonetheless I was glad this included a term I've needed for years but didn't know existed: \"the maieutic process ... Socratic midwifery...You know, the easing out of ideas. You help things out of my head, things that were already there but unformed.\" Also learnt that 'Murder in the Red Barn', which I'd always taken to be an entirely original Tom Waits song, must have been inspired by a 1930s British film, in its turn based on a real crime a century earlier.Full Dark House was 100-150 pages too long and sometimes silly in not a very good way. But it could be a whole lot worse. The regular cast-to-be are likeable, despite being drawn a bit clumsily in this first installment."}, {"userName": "Bandit", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit", "userReview": "I really thought I would like this more. The premise is great and I'm a fan of Fowler, he does terrific short fiction. But eventually seems like every author falls into a trap of serialized fiction. Fowler did so with Bryant and May, a pair of grumpy old men, formerly slightly less grumpy young men, who work for Peculiar Crime Unit...a british police force for the crimes that are somewhat off the beaten path. The book alternates narratives from present time(semi present, the book came out 2003) and octogenarian versions of the team to the 1940s and young twenty something year old Bryant and May, just starting to work together. Their first case is a version of the phantom of the opera, set in a London theatre, just like Bryant and May themselves are really just a version of Holmes and Watson. Fowler puts a bunch of customized finishes in to make this less of a pastiche or homage and more of the original story, so it makes for a fairly entertaining (if not wholly original) book. There is also a lot of very enjoyable very british humor that really livens up the book. As an audio book for me the narration didn't quite do the trick, which sucks because it seems like they have the same narrator for the entire series. Tim Goodman seems to do a perfectly good job reading the older Bryant and May, but just sounds entirely wrong for the half of the book set in the past, like an old man reading for a 21 year old part. Ideally, there should have maybe been two readers or a more age flexible reader. His women and accents were kinda off too. It remained noticeable and distracting throughout the book.

The story flits back and forth between the Blitz and the present, as May tries to find a correlation between a modern day bombing and the first crime he and Arthur Bryant tackled. Pitching back and forth between two time periods, we learn much of the Unit's beginnings in a war torn climate. A series of murders in a theater contrasts with the numerous deaths surrounding London. While dodging bombs from above, our detectives rely upon each other's strengths and form a balance between the believer and the skeptic, the fanciful and the logical. As much a murder mystery as a tale of friendship, Full Dark House brings to life two very distinct personalities and their journey through the secrets of the dark recesses of the theater. Bryant and May's camaraderie is supported by a cast of amusing characters: the confident female DS, the hard-nosed rules-loving newbie, the humourless forensic tech, some white witches and of course a fierce landlady who happens to be handy with a sword when the need arises. They serve to both bring attention to and validate the mad antics of Arthur Bryant as he solves his case in unorthodox ways. Flashes to the present show how much London (a character unto itself) has changed, as well as the degree to which May's perception of the city has been forever coloured by his partner's influence. All together, Fowler has created a likable cast of characters, as well as an interesting and twisted mystery.

In Full Dark House, Christopher Fowler tells the story of both their first and last case\u2014and how along the way the unlikely pair of crime fighters changed the face of detection.A present-day bombing rips through London and claims the life of eighty-year-old detective Arthur Bryant. For his partner John May, it means the end of a partnership that lasted over half-a-century and an eerie echo back to the Blitz of World War II when they first met. Desperately searching for clues to the killer's identity, May finds his old friend's notes of their very first case and becomes convinced that the past has returned...with a killing vengeance.It begins when a dancer in a risque new production of Orpheus in Hell is found without her feet. Suddenly, the young detectives are plunged in a bizarre gothic mystery that will push them to their limits\u2014and beyond. For in a city shaken by war, a faceless killer is stalking London's theaters, creating his own kind of sinister drama. And it will take Arthur Bryant's unorthodox techniques and John May's dogged police work to catch a criminal whose ability to escape detection seems almost supernatural--a murderer who even decades later seems to have claimed the life of one of them...and is ready to claim the other.Filled with startling twists, unforgettable characters, and a mystery that will keep you guessing, Full Dark House is a witty, heartbreaking, and all-too-human thriller about the hunt for an inhuman killer.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Full Dark House\n      \n          (Bryant and May #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5057659-full-dark-house", "average": 3.69, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328301909l/5057659.jpg", "reviews": 877, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3912.Christopher_Fowler", "name": "Christopher Fowler"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Historical", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5057659-full-dark-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3960300-full-dark-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/474064.Full_Dark_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11804798-full-dark-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108531.Full_Dark_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/965374.Full_Dark_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3960298-full-dark-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7047925-full-dark-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15700110-full-dark-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455821.The_Water_Room", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5743.Seventy_Seven_Clocks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2574912-the-victoria-vanishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/275810.Ten_Second_Staircase", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/602698.White_Corridor"]}
