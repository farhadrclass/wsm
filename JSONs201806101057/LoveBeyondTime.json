I wanted to do a RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK type story, and then cross it with SLEEPING BEAUTY. Except that my Indiana Jones is a cute, stubborn, and very female scientist named Polly Parker. And the Ark she discovers is not an Ark, it's a Hunk!!!Raiders of the lost hunk?Jade Panther is more than a hunk, of course. He's an ancient warrior, a mystic, a man of unlimited sensuality and vast hypnotic powers. Did I mention he used to be a prince and was worshiped by millions of adoring females? That was before the horrific catastrophe that destroyed his civilization . . . So now Polly has awakened the sleeping giant. And of course, after a slumber of thousands of years, the green-eyed hunk has only one thing in mind. Saving his planet!Oh, I could go on, but what's the point? If you're in the mood for a zany, funny, science fiction romp with some steaming hot love scenes, I really think LOVE BEYOND TIME might be just your cup of tea!"}, {"userName": "Charleah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32933633-charleah", "userReview": "This book was an okay read. It definitely had love nearly at first sight. A god is awakened by a scientist on an archeology dig. An evil is alive in the guise of the God's fiancee. There is havoc unleashed on the planet. The scientist's fellow workers are attacked and her father has to take responsibility and headship for once in his life. The race is on to reach the mountain top for....? You will find out if you read the short book. one very short spanking scene that did not seem to fit."}, {"userName": "Hella Bella", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54039905-hella-bella", "userReview": "Normally science fiction stories send me straight to beddy-bye, but this one made me laugh and laugh! That Jade Panther is such a hunk, and I liked the heroine too. Especially her spunky spirit and her real life issues with her dad!"}, {"userName": "Etta Stark", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30799390-etta-stark", "userReview": "This is a fast-paced adventure story which literally throws us into the story from the very first paragraph as our heroine tumbles into a ancient tomb and reawakens a mystical warrior with a magical destiny.The book is set on an alien world some point in the future and Carol Storm does an admirable job of building a believable world for our heroes to inhabit, both the contemporary world of Polly and the the ancient world of the warrior prince, Jade Panther. The history of the planet is neatly explained without recourse to clunky exposition and a number of apparent cliches get turned on their head in some rather neat twists.The romance between the hero and heroine builds slowly over time but the attraction is there from the start. Which is handy because they have a very specific, sexy to fulfill. Luckily our two heroes are up for the challenge."}, {"userName": "Kathy Heare Watts", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7640523-kathy-heare-watts", "userReview": "Polly Parker is a geeky scientist who has traveled with her father, Professor Parker and a group of explorers to a barren planet for research. Polly accidentally stumbles and falls into a tomb where she finds bones and a hunk of a man who she brings back to life from a slumber of thousands of years, Jade Panther. But dark forces are at work, Night Flower is determine to stop Jade Panther with her evil and destruction. For the planet to be restored , Jade and Polly must get to the top of the Mountain of Light and have sex. She happens to be the virgin in this story! This is a quirky but fun Sci-fi story. The sex is mildly described and the storyline is humorous. It is a good versus evil plot with an Army of Dead and prehistoric creatures that abound with evil controlled by Night Flower but beauty and healing with love and acceptance are in the power of Jade and Polly."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39453356-katie", "userReview": "Love Beyond Time is yet another example of why I love Carol Storm's writing! It is full of many enjoyable components that make a story very entertaining, and is fun all the way through. I think this may be my favourite of Carol's books that I have had the pleasure of reading.One thing I loved about this story was that the plot was strong. I was intrigued by how Carol Storm would write fantasy and sci-fi and I was not let down. The book combined adventure and love and humour, and was great at it! It follows archaeologist Polly's journey as she falls into an ancient tomb and becomes caught up in the enigmatic world of the handsome Jade Panther, a man who was destined to revive the long-dead planet with his wife. However, the enchantment has been disturbed and the woman fated to aid him has in fact, turned against him. It is up to Polly and Jade Panther to bring life back to the once beautiful world.The two main characters, Polly and Jade Panther, made a brilliant couple. I really liked how Carol explored their relationship throughout their travels and trials in each other's company. They had a lovely friendship as well as being lovers, and often had nice, comical moments together. I especially liked the way their two very different worlds came together and both used their mutual experiences and knowledge to continue on their quest! Polly's spirited, lively character and Jade Panther's strong but sensitive masculinity was a wonderful combination, and there was definitely delicious tension between them all the way through the story! Another part I enjoyed was the inclusion of the relationship between Polly and her father, a somewhat strained relationship that developed as the book continued. Jade Panther's violent history with his brothers was also interesting, providing depth to him and his actions on their journey. And as the bubbly protagonist needs a suitable antagonist, Night Flower (Jade Panther's intended) was appropriately evil, using the past against the two heroes!Once again, Carol Storm's words and fast-paced plot lines captivated me. I was intrigued to find out what happened through the story, and loved the way the faraway planet was described. The ending was a touching conclusion to the book also. I loved the mysterious parts of the story, but Carol always knows how to keep it light and bouncy! I would recommend this story to anyone who enjoys exciting, energetic reads, a sizzling romance, and a bit of adventure - a delightful book!"}, {"userName": "Marybeth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13464943-marybeth", "userReview": "This was a very short novella. Polly and her father are scientists and they have come to this planet to search for clues about the civilization. Polly accidentally falls into Jade Panther\u2019s tomb and finds the golden medallion that wakes him from his slumber. Jade needs Polly to travel with him to a distant mountain so that they can make love there and restore the beauty to his world. Along the way, there are night terrors for them to get by and raised corpses. But, love does prevail and there is a HEA. This was a cute story, but I wish it would have been developed more. It seems like the story needed more depth. Also, the ending was pretty abrupt. I just wish that it had been a little more developed. I give this story 3 stars."}], "description": "When Polly Parker tumbles head over heels into an ancient tomb, she discovers more than old bones.
