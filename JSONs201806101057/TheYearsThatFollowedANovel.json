I need this."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188447-jessica", "userReview": "She has, she supposes, made half a life. And tomorrow is another day. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.\nIt\u2019s been five and a half years since I worked in a bookstore and I never miss it as much as when I get to the end of a book and I need to tell everyone I know how much I loved it. I loved this book so much, guys. I haven\u2019t been in a very \u201creview-writing\u201d headspace lately, but this book has busted me out of that rut, that\u2019s for sure, because I need to tell you how good it was.Because The Years That Followed traces the lives of two women over the course of 25 years, it\u2019s getting a lot of comparisons to Elena Ferrante\u2019s Napoleonic novels. Catherine Dunne\u2019s two characters, however, are not friends. Their lives only overlap a small amount\u2014they spend time in the same cities, they meet some of the same people\u2014and yet, their lives mirror each other\u2019s just enough that it\u2019s hard to believe they are so distinct. I don\u2019t want to give too much away, because knowing relatively little of the plot really helped suck me in. But you need to know a little bit, so here you go: Raised in Ireland, a teenaged Calista moves to Cyprus after falling in love with a much older man. Shortly after they are married, he becomes violent toward her and she feels trapped, living with her in-laws in foreign country. Meanwhile, Pilar runs away from her home in rural Spain because her mother wants nothing more than for her daughter to avoid her own fate: trapped in a marriage with an angry man. Pilar starts a new life in Madrid, with the help of a man her mother trusts, but she too finds herself drawn into a romance with an older man, which will also have unforeseen, lingering consequences. If I am to be 100% honest, this is the book I wanted when I picked up Ferrante. I read the first two Napoleonic novels and never felt compelled to keep going. The writing was fine, the characters were fine, but the pacing was slow and I never really felt connected to it. This one, though, it had everything going for it. The characters were complex and engaging, the plot was tense and well-paced, the tone was melancholy without being over-the-top. This is the kind of book that I read for hours straight just to find out what happened. The novel alternates between Calista\u2019s point of view and Pilar\u2019s, with other characters occasionally chiming in as needed. The book opens in 1989, but then jumps back to tell each woman\u2019s origin story through the 60s and 70s before eventually culminating in the present day. There is some bouncing around, with many of Calista\u2019s chapters opening in 1989 as she muses over an event she knows is coming, before drifting back to the past: \u201cShe remembers X, Y, and Z. How could she forget Z? [paragraph break] It is 1969 and Z is happening.\u201d It\u2019s a little clunky, and I do think Dunne could have done away with a lot of that without killing too much suspense but that's a very minor quibble in the grand scheme of things.The book really was just so, so damn good. There\u2019s love, revenge, regret, some subtle tie-ins to Greek mythology. It's got the same basic undercurrent of \"effing patriarchy\" that Ferrante's got. It's got so much. And it surprises me that it has so few reviews around here, because it deserves SO MUCH more attention. I can't recommend it enough."}, {"userName": "Bandit", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit", "userReview": "My dearly beloved is traveling in Ireland and I, being more of an armchair traveler, decided to try an Irish author, although I must say as international as this story is, Ireland doesn't really feature here all that prominently. I'm not sure the book's description does it justice, not is it particularly accurate. In fact, although both get wronged, only one of the two heroines of this novel is after revenge and the novel isn't anywhere as...cheesy isn't quite the right word, maybe scandalous as it comes across. What is it (to me anyway) is a terrific work of literature, a story, two stories really, tangentially, but inextricably intertwined into a smart, sad tale of all those intrinsically mortal conditions, like love, betrayal, vengeance and so on. I wouldn't marginalize this as just a love story, although both main characters' fates are decided by the mistakes their young hearts make and spend years paying for. Calista's story seems more significant of the two and it plays out much like a Greek tragedy, complete with Cyprus setting and a very traditional (although in this case sadly misogynistic and abusive) greek husband. One must have in mind that most of it takes place before women lib and all that, brutal and primitive as it comes across to the modern eye. She wants revenge (nod to the band where every song is of sordid and dysfunctional affairs) and throughout the novel in alternating chapters of varying chronologies and locales we find out why. It's a good book, very well written, I liked it much more than I thought I would, in fact it utterly engaged me (no small task) on an emotional level. It is also really great to see a female author who can write a book about female characters and at no point devolve into chicklit. This is apparently Dunne's US debut, though she is quite well known in her native Ireland and has written a number of books, internationally translated and even prize nominated. Well, this is a most welcome debut then. Recommended. Thanks Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3386994-jill", "userReview": "The Years That Followed has been compared to Ferrante's Neapolitan novels, so I certainly had high expectations. I was not disappointed!If I am comparing this to Ferrante I would say it is similar in that it tells the story of two interesting women over decades of their lives, but rather than their friendship being the central theme, the women's lives circle around each other and they only meet once. The writing style is also different, but the overall gritty feeling and the women's struggles to be true to themselves regardless of the societal constraints certainly reminded me of Ferrante.For me it was a page turner, and I really enjoyed reading about Calista & Pilar. This was my first book by Catherine Dunne, and I will certainly read another! A solid 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Terri Jacobson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8370501-terri-jacobson", "userReview": "4.5 stars.Catherine Dunne has written 9 novels, but this is the first one I've read. I have to say, I just love her writing. The Years That Followed tells the story of two strong women: Calista, a young woman of mixed Spanish and Irish heritage, and Pilar, a young woman growing up in poverty in a small Spanish village. Dunne slowly weaves the stories of these two lives into a complex pattern of love, ambition, and revenge. We follow their stories over a period of almost fifty years.The book drew me in from the beginning. Dunne's writing is rich and the characters nuanced. The novel moves seamlessly from Ireland to Spain to Cyprus as the characters grow and change. A truly excellent reading experience."}, {"userName": "Kelsey", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21843944-kelsey", "userReview": "Very Ferrante-esque except I liked this WAY MORE.

"Many critics feel this is a story about children and family, for me it was more about how easily women are swept away by love and the consequences of their choices. This story is beautifully crafted bring the lives of the two main characters Calista a young 17 year old Irish girl who is swept off her feet by the attentions of an older and glamorous older man, and Pilar, a young Spanish girl raise in a peasant family from a small village who escapes poverty and runs to Madrid to secure her fortune and independence.This blending of tales also struggles against the place of women within patriarchal cultures: Calista falls in love with a businessman from Cyprus, and Pilar who has spent most of her youth sacrificing to build a financially secure life with little time for love falls for an very much older married man, a Greek patriarch.It is a cautionary tale, as though literature doesn't have hundreds, but it is spun in a way that allows the reader to have sympathies for many of the characters. Often young women like Calista feel that they have to flee toward independence and autonomy by falling into marriage without ever finding themselves first. Often they are swept away by older men who make them feel that they must be more sophisticated and more mature than they are which is immensely flattering. They never think that an older man has chosen them because they are malleable and those men often fail to make relationships with adult women because they are while charming too controlling. No matter how many mothers may warn them, the young feel that love will overcome everything, which it rarely does. Pilar who in believing she is protecting her independence becomes enamoured by an older man who is married, and like most women new to love imagine that their time together will be enough which it never is.This tale also plays with the meaning of family, family secrets and loyalties. Most of us never think of our parents as real people, we never imagine them young and foolish, we fail to understand the trade offs they have made or why they choose the battles they choose.Very insightful into the fragility of human choices and spun in a way that will capture the reader."}, {"userName": "Karla", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6364949-karla", "userReview": "It was overall an okay read, however I couldn't help but think that it could have been wound down to a 3 minute read in a take a break magazine.

Petros Demitriades, as it turns out, is a wealthy Cypriot who made his fortune from the hugely profitable shipping company whose management he hopes one day to turn over to his four sons.Calista, daughter of an affluent Irishman and his Spanish wife, falls in love with Alexandros, the youngest of the four Demitriades sons, when the young man comes to Dublin to represent his father in a new business arrangement between the two families. Pilar, whose parents are impoverished farmers from the Extremadura region of southwest Spain, is so determined to escape the life she seems destined to live that she flees to Madrid in search of a better future. There, with help and guidance from an old friend of her mother's, Pilar is justifiably proud of the new life she creates for herself. But it is her misfortune that the first time in her life that she falls in love it is with a married man: Petros Demitriades, the father of Calista's lover and eventual husband.Neither of the two women's lives will ever be the same. The Years That Followed is a novel of revenge, one in which one of its two main characters is so callously mistreated that eventually she can think of little else other than getting even with the man responsible for causing her a lifetime of grief. By then, the other main character has sworn off of men except for the occasional one-night stand she treats herself to - and so much regrets the next morning. Dunne's plot is a well choreographed one in which Calista and Pilar deal with the same people while managing to remain completely unaware of each other's existence. The author alternates the present day action of 1989 with flashbacks to the previous decades as she tells her story, a story that relies largely on coincidence to reach its ultimate climax - and it should be noted that readers willing to suspend their sense of disbelief are going to enjoy the novel a good bit more than those unable to do so.For the most part, I managed to suspend my own sense of disbelief (although there were moments I really had to work hard to get there) right up until the point that the novel's final big \"reveal\" is made. That revelation, necessary as it may be to tie up all of the novel's loose ends, did, I have to admit, leave me groaning at the sheer implausibility of what I had just read. The book\u2019s climax is so held together by coincidence and luck, in fact, that its lack of believability overwhelms everything that precedes it."}, {"userName": "Joy D", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d", "userReview": "Nuanced fiction set in the 1960s through 1980s in Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus, about two women, Calista and Pilar. They are not related, except peripherally through ties to the wealthy Demitriades family. It is a story of questionable choices driven by youthful impulse and a feeling of being in love. Unfortunately, these choices have painful ramifications.Calista, an Irish 17-year-old, is swept off her feet by an older man, marries, and moves to the family home in Cyprus. She finds out about his jealousy and violent tendencies too late. Pilar escapes poverty in her home town and moves to Madrid. With the guidance of a family friend, she eventually owns property and supports herself. She impetuously gets involved with a married man, leading to consequences that shape her life.This book starts with death. It then unfolds gradually, as we get to know the back-story of what happened. The author has a way of bringing the characters to life through her well-crafted language. It felt a bit choppy at times, jumping between the two primary protagonists\u2019 stories. Themes include: struggles of women in a patriarchal culture, the influences of family, and the ramifications of choices. Recommended to readers of tragedies, stories of revenge, or slow-burning, character-driven novels about family relationships. Contains descriptions of domestic violence."}, {"userName": "Karen Raskin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4094545-karen-raskin", "userReview": "4.5 stars.

Catherine Dunne\u2019s novel captures the atmosphere of Greek fatalism by beginning with the double murder of father and concubine, then recounting in short vignettes the years that led ineluctably to the heroine Calista\u2019s decision. There is fatalism, too, in the spare narrative voice, which by employing the present tense and the repeated use of first names rather than pronouns lends the prose a documentary, voice-over feel. Far from dating the story, allusions to Northern Ireland, Franco\u2019s Spain and the divided Cyprus of Makarios suggest how timeless it is, but the novel\u2019s greatest strength by far is the psychological portrait of Calista, and the shame she feels at being a battered wife.

One-dimensional characters, crazy coincidences (or maybe Greek fates!) to tie it all together and just plain old unrealistic shit going down the entire novel. 17 yr old Irish girl Calista marries 30 yr old Cyprus tycoon, Alexandros, within 5 minutes of meeting him. Why he chooses her is a mystery that is never made clear. If he was looking for someone overly naive and malleable Calista didn\u2019t seem to fi the bill too well, but I think the reader is supposed to look at the age difference and think that is why Alexandros chose her. They move into the family home in Cyprus, bad, Lifetime-esque stuff happens, reader is supposed to be shocked because she sure didn\u2019t see THAT coming! Meanwhile Pilar in Madrid gets alternating chapters and reader learns about her poverty and her super-fortuitous luck in finding almost a guardian angel-type figure to help her become a woman with property and other stuff happens to her, etc. Oh my gosh! Will there be a connection between these characters at some point? Might it have something to do with the Cyprus tycoons? I don\u2019t know! Let\u2019s keep reading to find out how many more trite travails our 2 main characters can endure. The author clearly wants this book to be sincere and serious and maybe even issue-laden (domestic abuse, women\u2019s rights, class struggles) and that just can\u2019t happen in something so corny and obvious and cliche. The cover of my ebook has a quote from Roddy Doyle that says \u201cExciting, Elegant, Urgent, True.\u201d I never choose to read a book based on what I think are bogus, quid pro quo quotes from authors, but this one really struck me because it is SO OFF!! I won\u2019t go into the first 2words, which I take issue with as being a bit off as well, but Urgent?? True?? Those words cannot and do not apply to this frothy, fairy tale of revenge beach read Maybe that\u2019s some standard quote that Doyle doles out whenever he\u2019s paid I mean asked to blurb something cuz if you don\u2019t think about it too much you could say that about almost anything, right?Knowing that The Years That Followed is loosely based on Greek mythology doesn\u2019t make this book more palatable.

I am trying to include more contemporary fiction in my reading and while this one did go back and forward in time it is a tale of love, hate, betrayal and revenge more than anything else. It entwines the lives of two women who are wrapped up with the men of the same family although they don\u2019t know each other and it is only fate (karma? kismet?) that even brings them into each other\u2019s orbit.Calista is a young girl in Ireland who longs to escape what she feels is her boring life with her parents. As is the case with most teenagers she feels she knows more than her mother and longs to break out and see the world. She thinks that escape is going to come by way of her relationship with a work colleague of her father. She dates this older man behind her parent\u2019s back and soon she is getting married not realizing that his \u201cdevotion\u201d is nothing more than obsessive possession.Pilar\u2019s story is not as clearly defined and in some ways it seems to be there only as a foil for Calista\u2019s revenge. She is the daughter of an abusive man married to a woman who loved another. As her mother lays dying she tells Pilar to get out of their small village \u2013 do it NOW she says or you never will. She gives her some money she had hidden and the name of a lawyer in the city who will help her. Pilar suspects this is the man her mother loves.Calista withers within her marriage and finally cracks and tries to leave but her husband\u2019s family is powerful. She gets away but cannot take her children. It\u2019s a devastating choice but one she feels she must make because she doesn\u2019t think she will survive otherwise. Pilar, on the other hand blossoms. She works hard, saves and invests with the help of the lawyer and soon finds herself wealthy. Wealthy but not necessarily happy. She has not found love. But then one day she meets a man and she falls hard. The only problem \u2013 he\u2019s married. But that doesn\u2019t stop Pilar from falling in love, even though he is honest in that he will never leave his wife.At this point it gets hard to further discuss the plot without spoiling some of the twists and turns. And there are a lot of twists and turns. It\u2019s part of what makes the book such an interesting read. It\u2019s also part of what makes the book such a head shaker \u2013 you just wonder at the coincidences. But if you can just ignore that little voice in your head and just read you will find yourself in a real page turner of a book. It\u2019s not perfect but it does bring you full circle on the odd turns of life."}], "description": "Acclaimed international bestseller Catherine Dunne\u2019s thrilling US debut is the story of two wronged women bent on revenge at all costs.Revenge is sweeter than regret\u2026Dublin.
