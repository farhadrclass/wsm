I know my trusted friends set us up, and they have really good taste and usually know what I like, but it's just not going to work out between us. I like awesome, interesting female characters, and while I will give you that Murphy is awesome, the rest aren't cutting it for me. (Never mind that every time a female character DOES show up, no matter how dire the peril, Harry makes sure to describe the precise way whatever she's wearing cups her breasts. If she is, in fact, wearing that much clothing to begin with.)And, you know, everyone's been telling me I should just wait it out with you. That the books that come later are much better and SO worth it, but frankly, I heard you have a kid, and a vampire ex-girlfriend in the refrigerator, and that's just not part of my 5-year plan. I'm sure that somewhere out there is an amazing reader who loves you for who you are - 300 pages of a main character who has worse days than Jack Bauer, constantly finding that LAST OUNCE of strength to fight, and then another ounce, and one more ounce, and an ounce in the back pocket you were holding onto for the penultimate chapter.So, you know, it's not you; it's me. I'm just not jiving to what you're offering. We can still stay friends, though, because I've heard your friend Codex Alera is kind of cool, and I wouldn't mind hanging out with him maybe.And if anyone tells you that this is because I've already been hanging out with a different wizard named Harry, you leave that sweet British boy out of this, Dresden."}, {"userName": "\u2718\u2718 Sarah \u2718\u2718 (former Nefarious Breeder of Murderous Crustaceans)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298986-sarah-former-nefarious-breeder-of-murderous-crustaceans", "userReview": "\u25cf Jim Butcher How Could You Do This To Me Buddy Read (JBHCYDTTMBR\u2122) with my slightly unhinged MacHalo Freaks wife/sister/aunt Shelly \u25cfWho are you and WHAT THE BLOODY FISH have you done with Formerly Awesome Happy Dresden (FAHD\u2122)?!Was this really written by the same author as books 1 and 2 in this series?

In my view.- I typically don't like ghost stories, so there's that.- I don't like religious fanaticism, and one of the main supporting characters in this is one, so there's that.- This feels like it was written a long time ago, with the goofy things Harry says.

Tormented, violent, and deadly ghosts that only Harry Dresden can stop. First thing he needs to do before stopping the madness would be to find the one causing it. The first two novels were good, but this third one was even better. Dresden should be likable by now, and so should the other recurring main characters. Michael was a great addition to the team. I'm not sure if he's in it for the long run, but the Harry-Michael team was a very fun read. The plot thickens in this novel because Butcher gave it more depth. A lot of plot twists here and there, and more magic. As an UF novel with a wizard as the main character, magic should be copious. It was copious in this novel, and I finally saw what Harry could do with his powers. I was complaining then that the author didn't focus on that, but this novel was not a let down. In the first and second novels, the author introduced the Giant scorpions, Oversexed vampires, and Psychotic werewolves. To be honest I wanted the scorpions to make their reappearance, but necessary for the plot, we got the oversexed vampires. I wasn't shocked that Bianca made a reappearance because by now you should know that Harry had unfinished business with her. The vampires here were a bit violent, and I liked them a bit. A little more violence and that would be perfect. The main antagonist here would be the ghosts, but Butcher introduced 2 main villains. I don't want to spoil so let's just say both the main villains were violent and fun to read. The ending was a bit cheesy, but not enough to annoy me.4.5/5 stars. I liked this better than the first one. Amazing characters and the plot improved a lot. Time to continue on with the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin", "userReview": "Good ol' Harry Dresden is at it again, only this time the werewolves have been replaced with ghosts and vampires. Yep, ghosts... and vampires. Still not really sure why the vampires needed to be around, especially those siblings. Wow. The book starts out well with Harry and a new character named Michael,who is this crazy broadsword wielding priest, tracking down a ghost in the newborn wing of a hospital. It was a little different than the previous books in that it really jumps right in, that guy Michael is there all of a sudden, and it skips right on into the action. Even with all the weird ghostly stuff, Butcher maintains a sense of humor and never seems to take his writing or his books too seriously. I mean, the other bizarro world is called the Nevernever and the thing they are fighting against is the Nightmare. He's not very good at naming things. So yeah, Michael is there, and he becomes a main character all of a sudden even though he just showed up. Murphy kinda takes a back seat here. Susan bounces in a little bit. Where the book excels though is when it hits on Harry's backstory and introduces characters and events from his past. It seems to be teasing more information to be explored in future books, and I'm interested to see where it goes, to say the most. Just interested. Hopefully it's cool. The book is better than Fool Moon, but it suffers from many of the same issues as well. Butcher once again tries to tell too many stories at once, and it all just becomes a big cluster. It's like one of those roller coasters you ride as a kid where the hills aren't very big so you just kinda go up and down over and over. It's fun, but not as thrilling as the big adult roller coasters you're too short to ride. I'm not sure where I'm going with this. I've got to find a better illustration than the roller coaster. I've played that out. But it's true. There are like these mini stories where things build up and then fizzle out and then another thing will happen and then resolve but then something else wasn't ever finished so it pops back up until the end which is less satisfying than the middle somehow. Also, the thing Harry is after would have been much, much better if it had been given a prequel book of some sort. He kept alluding to this event that never happened in the other books so you really don't know or care much about it or the person behind it. Oh well. Harry also is always able to just wrap things up too easily. Makes his enemies seem really weak and not that threatening at all. I'm gonna keep rolling! These are great ways to kill some time without having to think too much. They are a nice little escape, and at some point I hear they get better. The bar isn't too high yet so we shall see what happens."}, {"userName": "HFK", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52263626-hfk", "userReview": "Re-audiobook experience. In my first review for The Dresden Files I threatened to send my underwear collection to Jim Butcher as a heavy fangirl thank you for creating something so mindblowing than our boy Harry. This caused one fellow reviewer to speculate that perhaps I did not go through with my threats as Butcher never blogged about receiving a collection of quality lingerie. This is something I gotta agree with. My delicates would without a doubt be something to write about, which is why I probably did not live up to my words. Maybe.And as much I still think Butcher is worthy of many more underwear collections with his wonderful, imaginative world building that makes me want to dedicate a lot of my precious reading time to him, the real reason why I always come back so quickly, not to mention me actually re-reading something, is the fantastic narration of James Marsters.Marsters has to be a God of Narrators. The way he develops through each book, bringing our boy Harry to life with his laid back, sexy, casual, friend-to-friend style is remarkable. He does his job so well, he becomes Harry. He is Harry, there is no Spike left in him. This is the role of which I shall remember him.However, all this brings an important question to the surface. If Butcher (hypothetically speaking) is, in fact, the new and proud owner of my lace beauties, what is one to send to Mr. Marsters as a thank you for his excellent, heart dropping performance?"}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14097149-ginger", "userReview": "Much better then the first two!

Everyone says by the end of book 3 you will see\u2026.This is one of those times that EVERYONE was right.Before this book I was really sorta thinking what\u2019s all the hype. I mean I liked them well enough but I really preferred two other series that were similar Charming and Hounded\u2026now Harry might be pulling ahead of at least Hounded (Charming still holds a special spot in my UF loving heart). Why is Harry pulling ahead? Well it could be the addition of some great new characters. Bigger badder baddies and a tragic star-crossed romance. I actually didn\u2019t care about the romance so much until the VERY end but the other stuff was fantastic.Who are these fantastic side characters?\u03de Michael \u03de \u2013 THE FIST OF GOD - is a fantastic addition. Everything he does is good and moral and he has a magic sword no not that kind ladies get your minds out of the gutter he is married It is an actual sword that he fights for God with. AMAZING._____ hand touched Michael\u2019s steel-clad arm\u2014and erupted into sudden, white flame, as brief and violent as a stroke of lightning. She screamed, a piercing wail, and fell back from him to the ground. She lay there, curled helplessly around her blackened hand, struggling to get enough breath back to scream. Kyle flew to her side. I looked at Michael and blinked. \u201cWow,\u201d I said. \u201cColor me impressed.\u201d Michael looked vaguely embarrassed. \u201cIt happens like that sometimes,\u201d he said, apologetically.\u2745Lea\u2745 - Harry\u2019s Faery Godmother, who wants to get the rest of his soul and turn him into part of her pack of dogs. She is one of the new bigger badder baddies I mentioned and she is the nice one. Which reminds me NEVER MAKE A DEAL WITH THE FAE\u2026have we learned nothing. No good can come from it. She is beautiful and deadly and ready to treat Harry like a dog\u2026.literally\u2656Thomas\u2656 - Member of the White vampire court and a good liar to boot. Is he a friend and ally or is he another trap waiting to happen. Currently it might be a little unclear. He is fun though and another great addition.\u201cBecause you can trust me,\u201d he(Thomas) said. \u201cI want to help you.\u201d I snorted. \u201cWhy the hell should I believe you?\u201d \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019m a good liar. One of the best. I\u2019m not asking you to believe me. Believe the circumstances. We have a common interest.\u201d\u2620 BOB \u2620 - Okay technically Bob isn\u2019t new but he is my favorite side character and he gets the best lines. Every time he is on page my highlighter goes a little crazy. I\u2019m so happy to see that he keeps up that witty dialogue and propensity for romance novels and sex in this book as well.\n\u201cYou want work, we make a deal. I want to do a ridealong the next time Susan comes over.\u201d I snorted at him. \u201cHell\u2019s bells, Bob, don\u2019t you ever think about anything besides sex? No. I\u2019m not letting you into my head while I\u2019m with Susan.\u201d The skull spat out an oath. \u201cThere should be a union. We could renegotiate my contract.\u201d\nAnd finally \u03de Charity \u03de \u2013 Eight month pregnant wife to THE FIST OF GOD\u2026.Micheal. I loved her immediately the first time she lit into Harry. Okay so she doesn\u2019t get a big part in this book but I can already tell she will be downright amazing in future books. Plus she and Michael have an amazing beginning story\u2026At least I think it is amazing since He slayed a fire-breathing dragon to save her Okay there are a few more very interesting characters that get a little page time including Ferro a dragon in human form, Mavra, of the Black Court of Vampires and a walking Nightmare. Really there is a lot going on.The story was better plotted out this time and I found myself much more drawn into it. Harry is still that bumbling guy that can\u2019t seem to catch a break and when one thing goes wrong they all go wrong. There was a new obstacle around every corner and he caused plenty of trouble that will have many repercussions going into the next book.Normally I'd be all over the romance and what happened in the end with that...but maybe it is because I know there are 15 books out already I'm trying not to get too attached or maybe it is because I really love Murphy and think she is the long term play I have no idea if she is or isn't and I don't read any of the blurbs cuz I want it to be a surprised so don't tell me I want to keep my ship as long as possible. I didn't really connect with Susan until the very end of this book and thought that is a great way to take the story. I love/hate it all at the same time. Like I'm supposed to.So lets just recap\u2026.Harry in this book manages to get in deep trouble with:\u2714 God \u2013 Or the Fist of God - Micheal\u2714 At least one court of vampires but probably 2 of them\u2714 The Wizard Council\u2714 His girlfriend \u2013 Susan\u2714 Some ghosts\u2714 A Walking Nightmare\u2714 His Faery Godmother\u2714 And Charity\u2026I\u2019d be the most afraid of CharitySure some of it he gets out of\u2026but that is a lot of trouble so I expect that the majority of it lingers.

I feel like it flows more naturally... Or maybe the story itself is just more interesting? I mean, it isn't great and I tend to prefer series that are more serialized than procedural as this one is but that's just personal preference. The central plot here introduces just another freak of the week. I do appreciate the introduction of at least a few major status quo changes and some plot lines that Butcher can start to thread throughout the series.To be perfectly honest, I don't think these books are particularly well written. Some of the dialogue is awful. Butcher should only be allowed to put Harry on the brink of death so many times. It was like 12 in this book alone. It would be hilarious to play a drinking game while reading. Every time Harry is convinced he's going to die; every time Harry says \"Hell's bells!\"; every time a ridiculously over-sexualized woman is introduced (double if Harry comments on her breasts).I think the characters are mainly idiots and make stupid choices for no discernible reasons. Harry still doesn't feel genuine to me. He's a stock concept: sarcastic, wannabe-hard-boiled-gumshoe who cracks jokes and spouts off catchphrases on cue; misogynistic but fancies himself a gentleman. I have no idea what motivates him to make certain dumb decisions other than that we're supposed to just accept at face value that he's a noble, self-sacrificing dude even though there are no previous indicators to suggest this. Peter David did this character so much better with Jamie Madrox in X-Factor, Vol. 1: The Longest Night.Why am I still reading this series, then? I guess I kind of like it in spite of everything? It's fun and easy and still just barely good enough to make me think it will get better. And James Marsters is a great audiobook narrator.

I seriously need to start writing my reviews in a word document. But ANYWAYS, that all just means that my rambling, ranty review from before has now become even MORE ranty and rambling and lacking order (and probably has typos), so enjoy ;]. I was originally going to give this book two stars, but quite honestly, there really isn\u2019t anything I liked about this book. At all. So one star it is. Where do I even begin? Basically, everything about the way Butcher writes pisses me off. And you know what pissed me off the most? Take a look at these three quotes, and see if you might possibly be able to figure it out: Exhibit A: \"A subtle motion of her back thrust out her young, firm breasts, so that their tips pressed visibly against the fabric.\u201dExhibit B: \u201cIt clung to the curves of her body, showed the perfection of her breasts, their tips clearly showing through the silken fabric.\u201dExhibit C: \u201cShe had a short, tight skirt make out of them, and more petals cupped her breasts like delicate hands\u201dExhibit D (BONUS): \u201cKelly sidled up to Michael, her breasts thrust forward, straining the sheer fabric\u201dThere\u2019s probably at least another two dozen quotes I could reference, these are just a few that I picked out. I\u2019m not kidding when I say this. Every. Single. Time. That a woman (and ONLY WOMEN) appears on these pages, Butcher apparently thinks it\u2019s necessary to give us commentary about every curve of her body, in a super weird way. Like\u2026. he can\u2019t just give a basic description of their clothes and appearance \u2013 nope. He describes them almost entirely, for THE ENTIRE BOOK, in terms of how their breasts appear under their clothes. If that sounds weird, it\u2019s because it is. Even weirder is the fact that he particularly seems to focus on nipples? (WHY ????????????) And it\u2019s even worse when you have to constantly be reading about it throughout the entire book. Literally, I was on CHAPTER FOUR and was getting a weird vibe about it, when he used this description for a girl who was trying to seduce him (OH LOL ALSO apparently every girl on the planet just WANTS Harry): \u201cNipple erection on command \u2013 now that\u2019s method acting\u201d\u2026. Are you kidding me? It\u2019s painful \u2013 no, \nexcruciating\n to read. Harry could be LYING IN A POOL OF HIS OWN BLOOD, and STILL, Butcher thinks this is a great time to talk about some female character's t-shirt.In book two he literally couldn\u2019t stop writing about the hair on the back of his neck, which was bad enough (feel free to check out my review of Fool Moon), and I guess in this book he decided to focus his writing in on something else, only to make it a million times worse by objectifying literally every girl who shows up in the story. Not only is it bad writing \u2013 it\u2019s just a bad way to write about women, period. This is bad, but I can usually still enjoy a book if I learn to just ignore the elements of the writing I don't like. I honestly legit had so many problems with the storyline though. First off, we are introduced to Michael, who apparently is super tight with Harry and they have completed a bunch of jobs together\u2026. Yet never appears, even in passing reference, in either of the two books that precede this one. This is fine. I can handle that. But the biggest problem I have is that the ENTIRE PLOT of this book was based on job/mission/takedown (or whatever you want to call it \u2013 they killed a demon) that Harry did with Michael, and this mission (again) is not in any of the prior books. All of the twists and turns, the development of the story arc, and even the development of Harry himself is rooted in an event that we never see happen. Why didn\u2019t Butcher just write a separate book about THAT mission, which was apparently so pivotal for Harry and the series? I don\u2019t know. Probably because it would have sucked as badly as this book did. Everything just felt like it was slapped together. We move from ghosts, to demons, to Sex Vampires (*eye roll*), to Harry's Fairy Godmother (another super weird and completely useless element of the story... felt like it was thrown in for convenience), through a myriad of plots and subplots that were just not that good. It was predictable and annoying to read. I\u2019m not trying to be a hater, and if you like these books then I\u2019m happy for you haha. They just completely are not for me. At best they\u2019re mediocre, and at worse they\u2019re just bad books with bad writing, and Jim Butcher has some seriously bad writing habits that he needs to take care of.

After considering the plot and the characters, I must confess that I found Fool Moon to be far more entertaining. Don't get me wrong. Harry and his quirks are very endearing but a number of issues irritated me in this installment. First, Murphy barely makes an appearance and the absence of a strong willed, take no prisoners, female character detracts from the overall effect of the story. Second, the criticism surrounding Harry's chauvinism finally makes sense. In the first two books, his attitude toward women comes across as gallant and even chivalrous, but the chauvinism is front and center in this one as Harry fixates on the breasts and luscious curves of virtually every female character - is this really necessary? Third, while the basic plot is compelling and the action scenes exciting, the execution is repetitive. How many times must Harry battle the Nightmare before he defeats it? How many times must he get round the machinations of his fairy Godmother? How many times must he be exposed to the lustful effects of vampire venom? How many times must his powers fail him precisely when he needs them the most? Come on already, get some new material. Finally, Harry constantly blames himself for the choices others make that get them into trouble. While this overdeveloped sense of guilt may have its place in the portrayal of Harry's internal struggle with his own conscience, it starts to grate on the nerves after a while. On a more positive note, the secondary characters both old and new are very engaging. Michael, a Knight of the Cross, constitutes an intriguing counterpoint to Harry's irreligious personality, and the manner in which Butcher depicts the power of Christian artifacts adds another layer of complexity to the world building. That said, Michael is a little too self-righteous and condescending for my tastes. There are also some poignant moments between Harry and his reporter girlfriend, Susan Rodriguez, although her misguided Lois Lane routine is getting old and she has never really appealed to me as Harry's love interest.The most interesting characters, however, are Lea, Harry's rather scary fairy Godmother, who serves as a cautionary tale about what happens when one makes ill advised bargains with the fae, and Thomas, the morally ambiguous vampire who plays a pivotal role in Harry's conflict with the various villains in the story. All in all, the world building is strong, the story has potential and the unanswered questions are interesting enough to keep on with the series."}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "I rarely feel the urge to read books in the \u201curban fantasy\u201d subgenre.

Still, if a series is enormously popular and it deserves a second chance, though probably not a third one, so I skipped book #2,  Fool Moon.A brief synopsis: Someone is causing an imbalance between our world and the spirit world causing a huge increase in paranormal activities. As a result, one of Harry Dresden\u2019s friends has been driven mad, and another one in a coma. In order to save his friends Harry and a few friends have to battle ghosts, demons, ghosts of demons, and more vampires than you can shake a garlic bread at.Another reason I seldom read urban fantasy is that\u2014for me\u2014it requires even more suspension of disbelieve than the standard \u201csword & sorcery\u201d fantasy. The setting is \u201cour world\u201d but with a magical component welded on, so the wizardry and monstrosities goings-on seem just a little ridiculous. I think this is the advantage of sci-fi, we live in a scientific world so even when the science is made-up (or just plain wrong) the fiction often has a ring of plausibility.Having said that, I have to admit I was pretty much sold on Grave Peril from the battle with a ghost a few pages in. It starts with a wonderfully creepy atmosphere and sudden escalation into a magical battle that is so kinetic and intense I forgot how ludicrous the whole premise is. In order to get the most out of the book, I decided to commit to the nonsense and just go along on Jim Butcher\u2019s wild ride. It does help that Butcher is very good at his chosen field, the internal logic or \u201cmagic system\u201d that he employs is consistent and believable within the setting he creates. Also, the pacing of the book is so fast that my habitual disbelief has no time to surface. Then there is the characterization.\u201cBut I\u2019m a sucker for a lady in distress. I always have been. It\u2019s a weak point in my character, a streak of chivalry a mile wide and twice as deep.\u201dI have had enough of anti-heroes, but a flawed hero with his heart in the right place is someone I can get behind. His sidekick Michael Carpenter, a \u201cKnight of the Cross\u201d, is also very interesting. If he was the protagonist of the series, it would probably have fallen under the \u201cChristian fiction\u201d label.\u201cHe\u2019s a righteous man.\u201d \u201cHe seemed nice enough to me.\u201d \u201cNo, not self-righteous. Righteous. The real deal. He\u2019s honest, loyal, faithful. He lives his ideals. It gives him power.\u201d\u201dThe pacing of the book is quite relentless and it almost never slows down to take a breather. Harry faces one crisis after another and almost dies every time, and more often than not he survives by coming up with outlandish solutions that sometimes feel like deus ex machina. The continuous battling does become a little repetitious by the end of the book but never actually boring, thanks to Jim Butcher\u2019s narrative skills. If I say \u201cturn your brain off and enjoy this book\u201d it would sound like a backhanded compliment that implies the book is stupid. It maybe silly, but it is certainly not stupid. Jim Butcher put a lot of thoughts into his world building, characterization and plotting, but it seems like he has done all the heavy lifting and the reader does not need to make any real effort to follow the story. By the end of the book, I felt quite satisfied and look forward to reading many more of Harry Dresden's ridiculous adventures.___________________Worldbuilding Quotes: These are examples of Jim Butcher's elaborate world building rather than passages of literary beauty (of which there is none, it's not that kind of book).\u201cNot a house,\u201dI said. \u201cA home. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\u201cSo what about Victor Sells\u2019s place? I hear you took him on, right?\u201dI shook my head. \u201cHe\u2019d screwed up his threshold. He was running his business out of it, using the place for dark ceremonies. It wasn\u2019t a home anymore.\u201dIn the circles of the supernatural community, an Old World code of conduct still ruled. When you have a problem, you settle it face to face, within the circle.Working magic directly on a human body is difficult. It\u2019s very difficult. Conjuring up forces, like my shield, or elemental manifestations like the fire or wind is a snap compared to the complexity and power required to change someone\u2019s hair a different color\u2014or to cause the cells on either side of an injury to fuse back together, closing it.\u201d___________________Funny Quotes:\u201cDead before the sun rises,\u201d I said. \u201cStars, Bob, why don\u2019t you just go all the way over the melodramatic edge and tell me that I\u2019m going to be sleeping with the fishes?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure that much of you would be left,\u201d Bob said,\u201cWell,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see this.

And this might be the one where Harry Dresden starts to slip-by his own standards- taking actions and committing deeds that in an ideal world he would not have chosen to do. Harry is the ultimate underdog in a way. He\u2019s always up against impossible odds, often achieving impossible feats with very little in the way of resources.

Honestly, he behaves too much like the stock hero of a romance novel, only with wizardly powers. Speaking of stock, am I the only person unimpressed by the story-line? It's a fairly middling urban fantasy plot: I actually preferred Fool Moon. The only good thing about the plot, for me, was how much time Murphy spent unconscious. Harry might irritate me, but Murphy makes me glad she's a fictional character, because she is too obnoxious to live.Also, I love James Marsters and could listen to him talk to me for hours, but if he has to say Hell's Bells ONE more time, I may be tempted to punch him.

I adored the magic, the description of how power worked, how Harry created his spells. I also loved how he got put through the wringer and had to really be willing to sacrifice himself for the survival of the people he loved.I hated the female characters. I hated that their breasts were described at every available opportunity, particularly the villains. During a climactic fight scene, a female villain was \"distracted\" by a vampire sliding his hands under her top, and I thought, \"Yes, of course the story had to go there.\" Susan, the girlfriend character, walks into danger and puts everyone else in danger with such willfully ignorant and selfish motives I could scream. (She is supposed to be smart, so why does she do something so moronic?) I feel like the women are all selfish sex objects.The writing technique is mostly clean and conversational with a few dips into purple prose, but I noticed the tendency to hurtle up to a tipping point, end the chapter, and then draw way, way back into a philosophical musing at the beginning of the next chapter rather than continuing with the action. I would have liked that on occasion, but not chapter after chapter.So even though I rated it a three (because of the icky representation of women), I really loved certain elements of the book, and reading the way it was worded and constructed helped me wrap my head around the way I approach writing myself, what works for me and what doesn't."}, {"userName": "Carole (Carole's Random Life in Books)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5892196-carole-carole-s-random-life-in-books", "userReview": "This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life.Every once in a while the right combination of things come together perfectly. This audiobook fits that description. I enjoyed this book the first time I read it years ago but listening to James Marsters perform this story really takes it to a whole new level. The series seems to really be taking off at this point and the story was very well done. I completely enjoyed every moment that I spent listening to this book during my re-read.Harry Dresden's life is anything but boring. This book starts with a bang and really doesn't slow down until the end. I love how many different things can come together to make sense in Harry's world. In this book, there are ghosts, demons, and vampires all mixed together and it flows smoothly. The mystery was pretty complex in this one with a lot of things happening that will be brought up again as the series moves forward. I had a hard time setting this one aside.I am so in love with the characters. Harry is awesome in his own way. He is funny and able to think on his feet. He makes decisions based not only on what is best for him but what will be best for others. He risks himself to helps other people quite often. Michael played a large role in this book and I really enjoyed his character. It was really fun to go back and see some of my favorite characters early in the series. Karin, Bob, Susan and everyone else really all added important pieces to the story as well.James Marsters is the perfect voice of Harry Dresden. I absolutely love how this book was narrated. He didn't just read the story - he performed it. I could totally hear every one of Harry's emotions in the performance. I was really impressed that even the perfectly placed breath seem to add to the delivery. He performed all of the different characters flawlessly. I can't wait to listen to more books narrated by James Marsters.I would highly recommend this series to fans of urban fiction. This is a series that you will want to read in order since there are some story arc that carry over from previous books. I am looking forward to listening to book four in the series very soon.

The plot started out strong and I was completely engrossed during the first half of the book. However, in the end, I found the plot to be overly strung out and convoluted to be convincing. Everything that which culminated into the climax just seemed too elaborate a set-up and Harry's resolutions to the endless stream of dire situations he got himself into begun to appear far-fetched, and even convenient at times. While I had issues with the plot, the expansionary paranormal worldbuilding and development of Harry's character continued to be the highlight of the series. The spooky ghosts, the mysterious Fae, and the intriguing vampire court were all completely riveting, as was the unexpected knowledge of the identity of Harry's godmother. This revelation really opened up a whole new dimension to Harry's back story which begs to be explored further. Character development kicked up a notch in this instalment. While Murphy didn't feature much in this instalment, there was a compelling and touching moment when Harry's wizard Sight revealed her in a spectacular manner. Harry\u2019s relationship with Susan also finally took a romantic turn, hitting both a high- and low-point, in the span of just this single volume. Harry gained a sidekick, so to speak, from a new character, Michael Carpenter - a Knight of the Cross who wields Amoracchius, an incredibly powerful object of faith in the form of a sword. Michael seemed a bit too righteous for my liking despite understanding that the strength of his unwavering faith made him into what he is and enables him to utilise the sword effectively. The pacing of the story ensured a strong momentum to keep the reader engaged so even though I had issued with the plot, I can't say that I was ever bored. There will be some serious consequences to our Wizard P.I. post the climactic events at the end of this instalment so while I both enjoyed and felt frustrated with this read, my curiosity and love for the supernatural should keep me powering through this series for the moment.

The only reason it took me so much time because I read it in the middle of my term final. Addictively thrilling\u2026 once you start it, it's hard to put it down. Something is always happening. One incident after another. I wanted to finish it in one day. But damn exam... I am a very impatient person when it comes to good books. Thanks to Rizwan vai who took out his time to convince me that Dresden files is worth another try after I felt very disappointed reading Storm Front. I skipped Fool Moon as I heard that the story starts kicking at Grave Peril. Well, it was not difficult getting around this without reading fool moon. I have to say, my time paid of brilliantly. I love magic and the magical world, spells, wand, faeries, potions. It has spells. It doesn't have a wand. But it has love potion :P Enough about the book. The best way to find how much good this book is to read it yourself. Now let's talk a little about Mr. Dresden. Dresden is a badass. And I like badass people like Harry Dresden. He is funny and very much human. He never losses his sense of humor, not even in crisis. \n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe,\u201d Michael said, sotto voce, \u201cthat you came to the Vampires\u2019 Masquerade Ball dressed as a vampire.\u201d \u201cNot just a vampire,\u201d I said, \u201ca cheesy vampire.

He has flaws just like any people. And it made him so much likable. He felt angry, defeated, tired, lost, terrified. Yet he pushed himself to finish the evil. He is willing to push himself till he die. That\u2019s what make him the hero of this series. I also like Micheal and Bob very much. With the righteousness of Micheal and chatter of Bob, they make the perfect combination with Dresden.\n\u201cMichael half-smiled. \u201cThe Lord will never give you a burden bigger than your shoulders can bear, Harry.

He's a lone wolf, so to speak, standing up to the Occult Forces of Chicago with only the support of his contact in the Chicago PD, Lt. Karrin Murphy. There's also intrepid investigative reporter Susan Rodriguez, for whom Harry's feelings are slightly more than professional. There's also the mysterious White Council of Wizards. While you may think that belonging to a worldwide magical fraternity might be a good thing, Harry Dresden would most certainly disagree. To be fair, he has a history - he did kill his mentor using black magic, which is something so bad that it's number one on their list of Things a Wizard Must Not Do, which comes with one free beheading. His associates in the White Council barely tolerate him, and make it very clear that he's worth more to them dead than alive. But more about this in other books....The point is that Harry so far has been a fairly small-time operator. Yes, he takes down evil sorcerers and vicious werewolves, but mostly on his own. In this book, the camera pulls back a little and we learn more about his world and his connections, and a broader story starts to emerge.The most interesting of these additions is Michael Carpenter, an associate of Harry's whose view of the world comes from a very different place. Michael is a religious man, a committed Christian who sees Harry's use of magic as impure and sullied, but associates with him anyway because they have a shared goal: the elimination of evil. Michael Carpenter is the Fist of God, one of the three Knights of the Cross. As such, he wields a faith powerful enough that even Harry can feel it. Oh, and he also wields a giant sword. With one of the nails from the True Cross worked into it. Amoracchius is a powerful weapon against evil, and a prize that anyone would be glad to have.In this book (as in all his books), Harry is given more trouble than he can handle. It begins with ghosts, as so many things do. The ghosts of Chicago are being stirred up by something - they're acting out in ways they would never act, causing an above-average amount of chaos and disorder in the city. And when there's ghosts around, tearing up the pediatrics ward of your local hospital, who is it you're going to contact telephonically? That's right - Harry Dresden.The ghosts are the least of his worries, however. The force behind them, the malicious entity that is driving the ghosts mad, is of far more concern to him. There's something out there, a Nightmare, that is out for blood. It's attacking Harry and his friends, and doing it through their dreams. Not just Harry's friends who are in good with the supernatural, but some of his Muggle buddies as well. This thing is angry, evil, and can tear a person's soul apart, leaving an empty husk that does nothing but try to scream.As if that weren't enough, the Red Court of Vampires is having a party, and they want Harry to come. Sounds lovely, right? A costume party with the vampires, a promise of protection to all invited guests - how can you have a better night? Myself, I'd start by not hanging around a house full of vampires and their allies. Especially when the hostess, a high-ranking member of the Court, has a serious personal grudge against me. The vampire Bianca wants Harry deader than dead, and she manages to set of a complex series of events to make sure it happens.This book, as I said, expands the Dresden universe a bit. It assumes that the readers are fairly comfortable with what we know, and gives us a lot more to think about. The world-wide spread of vampires, the hide-bound White Council, and the ramifications of having a Faerie Godmother. In the previous books, we saw Harry come out on top against small-scale foes - now the camera pulls back to show us how he goes up against larger institutions.In this book, Dresden is almost always out of his league - although I can't imagine who would be in their league while facing a hoarde of really pissed off vampires while being on the brink of death already. Buffy, probably. Or River Tam. Anyone written by Joss Whedon, I guess. But Dresden makes it through. Not in the \"Finding reserves of strength you never knew were there\" style found in the Whedon Supergirls, but more in the \"This just might be crazy enough to work, unless I kill myself doing it in which case it might not go so well after all\" style.Plus, it has my favorite trope of modern fantasy fiction - even if the hero wins, he doesn't actually save the day. In fact, things get a whole lot worse. Which is all gravy for Jim Butcher, because it means he has all the more material to work with for the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Heather K (dentist in my spare time)", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time", "userReview": "You know when you are reading a story and you are thinking, \"There is just NO way the characters can get out of this jam!!

A HUGE factor in my rating was the AWESOME narration by one of my faves, James Marsters. He is one of the few narrators that I love, even though he doesn't do separate voices for each of the characters. He is so emotive, so intense, so perfectly Harry Dresden, that I am spellbound by his performance. Honestly, I don't know if I would like this series as much in ebook or paperback form.
