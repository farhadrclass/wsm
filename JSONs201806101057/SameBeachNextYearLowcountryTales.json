My Review:I always eagerly anticipate reading a Dorothea Benton Frank book as I admire and relish her easy pace, bright wit, observant insightfulness, relatable plots, and twists of clever irony. She is a skilled illusionist and uses colorful distractions and crafty sleight of hand to keep us guessing; things are seldom what they seem.

The characters and plot failed to grasp my attention, perhaps because they both lacked dimension. If felt like I was watching a firm reel titled \"This is your life Adam, Eliza, Eve, and Carl.\" In an attempt to bring readers into the story, the author suffered from too much information, but not enough substance. I wish that Dorothea Benton Frank would recapture the magic from her first few books, as those of late seem to be filled with characters that lack imagination and are superficial."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/865502-diane", "userReview": "It's almost a shame that Dorothea Benton Frank's books always have such gorgeous covers because every year when I buy the newest one, I inevitably mess up the pretty covers with sunscreen. I guess she shares some of the blame, after all, her books are a summer right of passage. Summer has not officially arrived until I have the latest Dorothea Benton Frank book in my beach bag.This summer's book is Same Beach, Next Year set in her beloved Lowcountry of South Carolina. Each year Adam and Eliza and their young twin boys Luke and Max spend a few weeks at a vacation condo not far from home. Adam is a hardworking successful construction business owner and Eliza is a fabulous cook, who yearns to write a cookbook.One year, a new couple takes the condo next door and it turns out the woman is Eve, Adam's first love. Eve is married to Carl, a hardworking, successful pediatrician and they have a young daughter, Daphne, about the twins' age, and they are joined by with Eve's mother Cookie.The two couples get along famously, and although Eliza has her antenna up a bit about Adam and Eve, the fact that Carl is extremely handsome and shamelessly flirts with her distracts her somewhat.The four become fast friends, and along with Ted, Adam's father, and Ted's girlfriend Clarabeth, it's one big happy family as they meet every year for two weeks and swim together, golf together and eat together.Cookie likes to stir trouble, and she is hyper-critical of her daughter, which literally drives Eve to drink. Time flies by and Eve turns to Adam when she fears that Carl has been cheating on her. That sets in motion an incident that threatens two marriages and their friendship.One of the things I love best about Frank's book is that she makes her characters relatable. Eliza has two sons (so do I), her dog Rufus is her best friend (mine was Malcolm, my late beloved basset hound) and Eliza loves to cook, as do I (well, most of the time).This book is written from the perspectives of both Eliza and Adam, and I found it intriguing how Frank got into Adam's mindset. I have to say, though, I found his behavior and rationalizations puzzling, although I think each character makes some head-shaking choices here.Since Eliza is a cook, we get some wonderfully descriptive foodie scenes, from Eliza's trip to the Piggly Wiggly grocery store to Eliza's family Christmas breakfast (I could almost smell the cinnamon on the page) to the feast that Eliza has with her Greek family in Corfu.Same Beach, Next Year is another Dorothea Benton Frank winner, it's got everything you want in a summer beach read- great characters, sassy dialogue, interesting family and friend dynamics and a road trip to Greece. Maybe I should try covering my book in plastic so the sunscreen doesn't ruin the beautiful cover.You may recognize the book's title- an homage to the Alan Alda-Ellen Burstyn movie, Same Time, Next Year, which if you haven't seen, you should.

Technically her writing has really gone downhill, with timeline errors, typos, repeated phrases.

Without meeting her, the main character decides that her husband's high school sweetheart is a slut, yet she is lusting after the friend's husband. She is extremely judgemental, yet criticizes others for their \"un-Christian\" behavior of judging others.An inordinate amount of time is spent on describing clothes and food, and most of the characters are unlikable.The ending is implausible and rushed.

I opened the package and started reading it and did not stop! Nothing says summer is coming and makes me want to sit by the beach that a book by Dorothea Benton Frank.\u00a0Review:I thought the format of the book really worked, we heard both sides of this sometimes hilarious , other times serious \u00a0tale. Adam and his wife Eliza are the narrators of this story that spans about two decades. The formula for the book is typical Dorothea Benton Frank but that is all. The story is a departure from her usual books. I found this to be a very deep and moving story. Adam and Eve are first loves and they both seem to be caught in the past. I felt that Adam wanted to recapture his youth and Eve was just plain shallow and seemed unsure of her marriage to Stanley who is a successful Doctor and a huge flirt. I found myself wanting to smack Adam most of the book \u00a0for not truly appreciating Eliza. Adam kept manipulating ways to see Eve every summer and Eliza seemed to realize this but at the same time put up with it but kept an eagle eye on the situation. I found Cookie, Eve's mom, both mean and hilarious at the same time. Some of the things that Cookie came out with had me laughing out loud!Eliza was of course the voice of reason in this story and my favorite character as well as an amazing cook. What more could Adam want? His youth that's what! Their was lots of side drama involving Cookie, Adams Father and his girlfriend, a larger than life character.I also liked how the story follows the relationships of the two couples through their ups and downs. I really had no idea how it would all come to end but I thoroughly enjoyed going along on the ride and I absolutely hated for this book to end.This book is more than just the authors' usual\u00a0\u00a0\"beach read\" , it was a moving story about marriage and friendship.This review was originally posted on Cindy's Book Binge"}, {"userName": "Sue ", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/690922-sue", "userReview": "I am a real fan of Dot Frank and know that when her new book comes out every spring, it's time for summer and the beach! I have enjoyed all of her books but this is one of my favorites -- but I think that I say that every time I read one of her books.Eliza and Adam had been happily married for several years and were spending their vacation on the Isle of Palms with their toddler twin sons when Adam sees Eve - his first love from high school. Eve is at the same vacation complex with her husband Carl and their young daughter. They make plans for the two families to meet for drinks and even though they both tell their spouses that they were friends from high school, neither goes into detail about how deep their love for each other was. Sparks fly between Adam and Eve, even though they are both happily married, and it's apparent to Eliza and Carl that they were more than friends years ago. They manage to build a friendship between the four of them and they meet at the same complex at Isle of Palms every year until something happens years later to ruin the friendship and possibly the marriages. Will they be able to overcome the transgression that appeared to happen and become friends again?This is a lovely novel about love and friendship and keeping marriages happy as people head into their later years. I enjoyed all four of the characters but thought that Eliza was the most real and the best of the four. She grew more as a character and was able to learn to be herself and love who she was as a person and not just as a wife and mother. I also, as always, loved the setting.

Despite an awkward beginning marked by Adam acting like a besotted school boy with Eve, as well as Carl\u2019s shameless flirting with Eliza, the unlikely friends spent the next two decades vacationing together with their families. But when two of them are found in a compromising situation, the bonds of couples\u2019 long friendship\u2014not to mention their marriages\u2014are tested as never before.I greatly enjoyed reading Same Beach, Next Year. Frank has long been one of my favorite Southern writers, and I am always equally entertained by the characters as well as the location(s) the story takes place in. This novel proved to be a double delight concerning the latter\u2014much of the story takes place in the familiar Lowcountry setting, while other portions are featured in Greece. (Corfu, to be exact\u2026 and it\u2019s putting it mildly to say I was completely enchanted by it.)The story is told from both Adam and Eliza\u2019s viewpoints, and it has a kind of he said/she said vibe at certain points in the story. This is a good thing, in my view, particularly when it came to things that were an issue between them.There is a fairly large cast of characters included in the book. Most of them have a minor role, however, so there\u2019s no risk of forgetting who they are. (Although, there were certain characters that I wished had played a bigger role in the story if only to learn a bit more about them. They didn\u2019t need to have a larger part in the story, I was simply curious to know more.)There were a few instances where I read about something that happened, or was said, that felt unnecessary to the overall story\u2014for me, at least. This is probably down to my personal preferences, rather than any actual issues with the story itself, though. In any case, when something felt off, it wasn\u2019t to the detriment of the story, and it didn\u2019t lessen my enjoyment of it.Final ThoughtsThis was a fun read that kept me engaged throughout, with characters I was fully invested in. The plot was interesting, with a central conflict that was believable. The resolution wasn\u2019t quite what I expected, but it was effective and tied up all the remaining loose ends in a satisfying manner.Recommended for fans of women\u2019s fiction.I received an advance reading copy of this book courtesy of William Morrow Paperbacks via TLC Book Tours."}, {"userName": "Donna Hines", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47259487-donna-hines", "userReview": "Dorothea Benton Frank's books are simply magical.

This one was a departure for Frank, as it was less funny and sassy, and more sophisticated and deep. Eliza and Adam & Eve and Carl (or is it Adam and Eve and Eliza and Carl?) are neighbors each year at their beach rentals in coastal South Carolina. During their first summer there, Adam discovers that Eve is his long ago, deeply loved and lost girlfriend. He never mentioned her existence to his wonderful wife, Eliza, whom Adam does truly love. However, there is always something about that first BIG love, and that is true in this case. Meanwhile, there are some sparks between Carl and Eliza. Will any of them cross the line, or will they remain loyal to their spouses and keep their families in tact? Adam and Carl form a close friendship and the families become closer every year. At the start, Eliza and Adam have five year old twin boys, and Eve and Carl have a little girl about the same age. The children love their summer visits. The story goes forward in time until the couples are in their 50's and their children are twenty one! Many things happen over the years to the main characters and their extended families, including Adam's widowed father, Ted, and Eve's snarky (read that as RUDE and meddlesome) mother, Cookie.

Eliza was probably the most interesting character with the most compelling storyline, and the rest were somewhat entertaining. But the extremely annoying part throughout the entire is her husband Adam. He is such a narcissistic, immature man with no real crisis other than the \"grass is greener\" syndrome. There is no real climactic, lethargic scene for this guy, as there should have been. Yes, there is a somewhat eye-opening event that could or could not have caused him to reevaluate his perspective and his value of what he has, but we doing really get to see the transformation.

It is the story of two couple's who by chance meet at the Isle of Psalm's condos in the low country of Charlestown. Eliza and Adam vacation there with their two young son's Luke and Max. Eve and Carl Landers turn up at the same condo beach resort. Eve and Adam have been sweethearts when they were a lot younger. Eve and Adam have a night that they spend together where Adam spends the night sleeping upright while Eve cries on Adam's shoulder in a silk bathrobe. Eliza and Carl both show up and assumptions are made. Eve thinks Carl is having an affair with one of his young nurses.

At this point Adam and Eliza's two son's are off at college and she decides to fulfill a life long dream of going to Greece.This is most definitely very light beach reading written for women.
