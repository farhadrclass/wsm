If you know what I mean...Now I'm not actually saying that I wanted Sam and Kent to bone but I felt there needed to be more to the final part of the book than just a few vague kisses and a goodbye. I mean, poor Kent, right? he wakes up one day and, out of the blue, the girl he's in love with decides to give him a break and actually kiss him. Then she tells him that he's the best thing that ever happened to her. Then she dies. At least give the poor guy a happy ending... of sorts.

Back in 2010, I read Before I Fall and immediately thought I'd found a new favourite author. I eagerly awaited every book Lauren Oliver released after it and yet, I have disliked every single one. My dislike for her writing style in books like Rooms and Vanishing Girls made me wonder what happened. Could it be that Oliver's style had so drastically changed? Or was it my own changing tastes that had pulled me away from her books?Returning to this book in 2015, it is still as fantastic as I remember. It is truly such a strong YA Contemporary (with a non-realistic spin) and the writing is perfect. The saddest thing about reading this book again was finally understanding how much Oliver's style has changed, in my opinion, for the worse.Before I Fall is about popular mean girl - Samantha Kingston - and her group of popular friends. When Samantha dies in a car crash on the eve of her school's \"Cupid Day\", she awakens once again in the morning of the same day. Has she been given a second chance? A chance to put it right? To solve the mystery? To prevent her death? For the next seven days, Samantha wakes up on February 12. She must learn the truth behind her unfortunate end and, by doing so, she finds herself tangled up in the lives of those she'd cared little for before.The novel's strength is both in the overarching story and its outcome, and also in the details. So many characters are affected by Samantha's actions and they become more and more developed and complex as Samantha learns to really see them. Every character is handled with sympathy, turning mean girls, losers and geeks into human beings, each with their own story.It is a lesson on the dangers of bullying and how careless actions can have a huge negative impact on someone's life. But it also offers an understanding and sometimes sympathetic view of the people who do the bullying. It's such an interesting, multi-layered story.Moving, thoughtful, and just as powerful the second time around.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2098381-heather", "userReview": "I hated this book, and loved it. It\u2019s cruel, and frustrating, unfair, and yet it\u2019s also sad, and hopeful, and honest and authentic. I\u2019m not sure how everyone else feels about their High School experience, but I despised mine. You couldn\u2019t pay me to go back. However, this story was so vivid, that I felt as though I could smell the grease from the cafeteria, feel the rough tile on the bathroom floor and the chill of that cold fateful night. I even cringed at the hurt that all these characters so casually inflicted upon one another, so I guess I went back after all. Sam is not a nice girl. In fact, she is a bit of a bitch. Scratch that, she is a bitch. She doesn\u2019t set out to maliciously attack anyone, but she doesn\u2019t stand against it either. She won\u2019t instigate the chant of \u201cpsycho\u201d at the school outcast, but she shouts it just as loudly as her group of popular she witches. Worse, she actually believes that others should just accept the way they are mercilessly attacked because she was once mocked in the third grade for blushing, as if blushing were the equivalent to being called a whore, who bared the goods for grass when the person at the butt of that malicious lie doesn\u2019t smoke or has even been kissed. Naturally, when Samantha meets an unfortunate end after forcing us to spend a day in her insipid world, I hardly felt bad for her. How sad is that? A teen girl dies tragically, and I thought she got what she deserved. Thus is the beauty of this book. Told in seven chapters, each representing the same day, Before I Fall tells the story of a typically popular girl, who gets six days to right some wrongs. Make no mistake. I hardly think one day is sufficient to mend the hurt that these girls created. It in no way rectifies the things that Samantha has done, but it\u2019s a start in the right direction. Rather, I felt this story allowed readers to realize that there is depth to us all, even the bitches and we all have thoughts that should shame us. The character development of all the characters was astounding, and the character growth, drastic though it may be, was entirely believable."}, {"userName": "Penny", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/679025-penny", "userReview": "[I happen to like ambiguous endings because they give me the opportunity to think about what I just read--I can draw my own conclusions.

And foul language. MUCH foul languageLa la la, spoilers.Still spoilers.And language to make your grandmother blush.Fuck you book. Fuck. You. I want to drop this book to two stars for that goddamn ending. But I can\u2019t because even with that fucking ending it is not really a two-star book at all. So it gets dropped one star. DAMN YOU. I knew the ending was coming. This is the problem with reading the ending first (well, near the beginning). I think I\u2019d have been even angrier if I hadn\u2019t known, though, because I\u2019d be expecting that it would have a Groundhog Day's ending and Sam, having learned her lesson on being a better person, would get to enjoy the new, better life she\u2019s created. But no. She stays dead. FUCK YOU BOOK. I get your point, Oliver. Sam\u2019s real mission was to sacrifice herself for Juliet. That\u2019s what she came back seven days for, to be Juliet\u2019s guardian angel or something. You know what? FUCK THAT. Because Juliet might be better off, but everyone else in Sam\u2019s life? You don\u2019t think it will completely devastate her family? Her little sister? Her parents? Do you know what the divorce rate is for parents who have lost a child?!?!? It\u2019s not like they remember the other days Sam lived after death, either. So their last memories of her will be a wholly inadequate moment before Sam ran off to school and was nice and not a brat. Not a whole day together, not a dinner out, nothing big or something to hold onto. AND WHAT ABOUT KENT?!?!?!? He gets to see the girl he loves\u2014who has just stopped being a bitch and admitted she likes him\u2014die. How horrible. Really think he\u2019s going to be okay, Oliver? Really think you didn\u2019t just fuck up the most sympathetic character in your entire book? Scratch that, the two most sympathetic characters in your book (adorable little sister Izzy and adorable, amazing Kent)!?!?! Just because we don\u2019t get to see the tragedy rip through everyone\u2019s life like a bomb and you have Sam give some bullshit uplifting monologue at the end doesn\u2019t make it okay. Do you know why Groundhog Day doesn\u2019t end with Bill Murray dead? BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT ENDING!!! We want to see him ride off into the sunset with Andie Macdowell, both happier and better. WE DON\u2019T WANT TO SEE BILL MURRAY\u2019S GODDAMN FUNERAL!!! GAAAAAHHHHHH. The book started out slowly, and Sam is a right proper bitch to begin with. It isn\u2019t until afterlife day five (she gets seven days) that she begins to turn around. Although the complete fucking breakdown of day four was glorious. I think I\u2019m a masochist, because I love angry, self-destructive, insane meltdowns by heroines, especially when they end with the realization that there was no beauty in the breakdown, that it was a horrible, horrible mess and that instead of feeling free they feel even worse than before. And I especially love it when they are comforted by adorable, awesome love interests like Kent. Although set-up Sam was annoying (though realistic, ouch), when Sam developed and stopped being so shallow and self-absorbed I loved her. And I loved her even more for knowing how horrid she had been. There was so much development, and it all rang true. WHICH MADE THE ENDING EVEN WORSE. You know what, Oliver? I don\u2019t feel bad anymore for thinking your Delirium was a pathetic piece of crap cashing in on the post-Hunger Games dystopian YA craze. Because at least it will prevent you from DESTROYING MY SOUL for however many years it takes you to finish writing your idiotically premised trilogy (a society that hates love? Really? Really?). Maybe by then you will have learned a lesson and not written such, terrible, terrible endings to what otherwise could be a five star-level book. I actually contemplated hurling this book at the wall when I finished it, but it is 2am and I am a guest in someone else\u2019s house and I don\u2019t want to be rude. Now I\u2019m going to pretend that the ending didn\u2019t happen and Kent and Sam live happily ever after and both go to college in Boston and show up happily married at Izzy\u2019s high school graduation and everyone isn\u2019t destroyed by grief because Sam threw herself into a truck for Juliet. Don't think I can't, Oliver, because I've managed to half-convince myself over the years that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ends with Jen & Lo and Li Mu Bai & Yu Shu Lien happily married with beautiful babies and everyone hanging out and kung fu fighting together (the real ending made me angry for days). So, Oliver, when I think about this book in the future (IF I THINK ABOUT IT AT ALL), don't think I wont' half-believe that Kent and Sam are happily married with beautiful babies (AND MAYBE EVEN KUNG FU FIGHTING, I DON'T KNOW!!!). P.S. If you are masochistic enough to read the book after this review, listen to \u201cOnly If You Run\u201d by Julian Plenti on Days 5-7. It is awesome and if this ever gets made into a movie (WITH A BETTER ENDING) it has to be on the soundtrack. Addendum: Okay, I\u2019ve calmed down a bit and got some sleep and now am more coherent and less blindingly angry. And I\u2019ve figured out why the ending bothered me so much: it was a cheap trick. Partly because it feels like Oliver\u2019s response to those who will identify this as Groundhog Day meets Mean Girls (which it totally is, but in a good way). The ending seems to scream, \u201cIt might be like those movies, but look how much deeper this is. The main character dies. You don\u2019t see THAT in those movies, hunh?!?\u201d But mostly because martyrdom is fiction\u2019s shorthand for redemption. And, sometimes, it works (see: my undying love for Sydney Carton in A Tale of Two Cities). But in this book it doesn\u2019t. There\u2019s a quote banging around my head that I can\u2019t source: \u201cDying is easy. It\u2019s living that\u2019s hard.\u201d And dying was the easy way out for Sam. She spent her entire afterlife knowing that she would never have to live with the consequences of her actions. It was most obvious in the utter breakdown of day four, but it was present every single day. Throwing yourself in front of a truck can\u2019t be easy, but for Sam I think it would be even harder for her to live out the rest of high school, to have to stand up to Lindsay next time she tortured Juliet or wrote nasty graffiti about other girls or spread rumors about how so-and-so was such a slut or tried to talk Sam out of dating a social loser like Kent. Dealing with that every single day and knowing she had to live with the ramifications of her actions would be a true test of character for Sam. Could she do it? Could she stand up to the constant social pressure? Could she stand up to her friends? To Lindsay? Could she be nice to people and defend them and not let her friends be cruel? Could she risk being unpopular? Or would she slide back to the easier path, staying silent, telling herself it\u2019s not her fault because she didn\u2019t start it, that she saved Juliet\u2019s life that one time, so her karmic debt is paid? A better ending would have Sam not be able to return to normal until she stands up for Juliet at the party. Not try to talk Juliet out of suicide in private. Not avoid future consequences by dying. But being there when Juliet walks into the party and Lindsay starts a chant of \u201cPscyho! Psycho!\u201d Standing in front of everyone, in front of all her friends and peers, and telling them all to shut it, to stop being mean to Juliet. To tell everyone that Juliet\u2019s not weird, that they need to grow up and stop being such bullies. And then to wake up the next day and go to school and deal with the fallout of that. And actually befriend Juliet and deal with whatever the social consequences are. A less shocking ending, yeah. But a more satisfying one."}, {"userName": "Zo\u00eb", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9303625-zo", "userReview": "3.5/5Though I really enjoy Lauren Oliver's writing style, I struggled finding the motivation to finish this book.

I loved Delirium, it's one of my favorite series and 2. so many people raved about Before I fall , saying it is the best of Oliver's work. I couldn't disagree more. At the beginning I couldn't get into the story, it was a bit repetitive, so I had to put it down and read something else in the meantime. In the end I was getting a bit frustrated as I couldn't understand the whole idea of the book. Having finished it yesterday I've been thinking about it since and I still don't get it. Let me explain why...The whole story is focused on Sam's last day and her death in a car accident. Afterwards she keeps reliving it, no matter what she does when she wakes up it's still Friday the 12. The main thing I have a problem with is the dimension she is in, first I was hoping it's kind of coma and she will come back to life, but no she (or her soul?) keeps existing in a kind of a limbo and is trying to move on. Final conclusion of the book is that she had to learn to sacrifice her life (remember she's already dead) in order to move on, where? why? no explanation whatsoever. She just dies one last time and that's it. And even tho she does change during the whole journey, and also learns all the awful things her fiend did (including driving someone to suicide) she still loves her because she's her friend, really? I understand Oliver tried to write a book about cruel reality of teenage life and high school, wanted to pass a message of values more important than money or popularity. That I understand, everything else not so much. The book is well written, and if you don't focus too much no the metaphysical dimension of it you might enjoy it. I think that was my problem, I put too much thought into it. Unfortunately I was not affected by it and didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would."}, {"userName": "Annalisa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa", "userReview": "[My only disappointment was that the day before the last seemed more perfect than the last. Not for Sam, who learned to fall (or fly), but for everyone else. Especially Kent. I think you can interpret the last day two ways: either Sam learned what she needed to learn to move on, or the final day was the way that day was fated to be and Sam needed to get to a point where she could make that sacrifice. It makes no difference to her, but it makes a difference to everyone else. Which day do they remember? If it's the first, that's too bad for Sam and the mess she left. If it's the last, she left a lot of people with unanswered questions. I get that she couldn't focus on Kent, but she teased him and gave him too little. Even though the day wasn't about him, I still wanted Sam to leave him with an apology and a goodbye. I think Sam believed the last day only happened in her memory and a perfect day included a goodbye kiss to Kent, but then she bothered to give Anna that book and Izzy her necklace and save Juliet. I think a part of her still wanted to leave a legacy. I wanted to believe that last day for Sam and Juliet and Kent and maybe even a little bit for Lindsay. Maybe I didn't hate her so much after all.I keep going back and forth on what day is the real day. Sometimes I think the first one is an obvious choice, but then there are things about the last day that make me think that maybe that one was real. Especially with Juliet. It's like Sam was being told \"you're dead anyway. You can be selfish and claim that day, or you can use it to save someone's life.\" And that goes for Lindsay too. Getting drunk and killing your best friend would have messed her up. I think I believe the last day. At least I hope it. I love the ambiguity of it, but that it doesn't feel ambiguous. When you close the book, you know what happened, even though it could be interpreted on different levels.Either way, Sam took seven days to grow into the person she needed to be. For as sad as the ending is, there is so much redemption in. And that's what it's about, Sam's redemption, not Juliet's or Lindsey's or anyone else's. As hard as she tried, there was nothing she could do to affect change in anyone else. Lindsey can take the wake up call of her friend's death to change into a better person; Juliet can take Sam's sacrifice to get her through high school; or they can keep going on their set paths. Their redemption is up to them; all Sam could do was take what little she could in one day to encourage change in a lot of people. I can see this having an affect on teenage girls who might be caught up in their own lives and learn these lessons along with Sam. I'm an adult and I'll be thinking about this one for awhile. There's something amazing in Sam's growth and for that she gets five stars.

I have seen that before in a well-known and beloved movie, the \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d. It is a story of an arrogant and a mean teenage girl who, with her shallow friends, cares only about her popularity, parties, boys and bullying her less popular classmates. I won\u2019t blame her young age and her inexperience for being this cruel to people who surrounded her.

This kind of psychological violence has led many people to mental health problems, low self-confidence, suicide and a load of other problems. However, it is not only a story about bulling. It is a story about life, death and the real values of life. The main character develops throughout the story, improves her mistakes, and by doing that she saves the lives of people who really matters to her. She finds her atonement and she makes the readers to forgive her since she shows the greatest self-denial a person is able to demonstrate.\n\n\u201cThat's when I realized that certain moments go on forever.

The premise of the book is not too original - it is a sort of cross between \"Mean Girls\" and \"The Groundhog Day,\" but Oliver develops it well. Samantha, one of her school's mean girls, relives her last day over and over again, learning more about herself and people around her with each replay. Will she learn enough to make a difference, to change her attitude and her life?Being a foreigner, I was spared the misfortune of being bullied by mean girls, I don't have any experiences of Samanthas and Lindsays of this world. Therefore I am guessing my opinion of the book is somewhat skewed. I don't hate Samantha and her friends, instead I find this gang amusing in a dysfunctional way and feel sorry for them. Samantha seems to be an extremely unaware person, with low self esteem who doesn't even realize that she is constantly mistreated by her boyfriend, she is directionless and has almost no aspirations beyond getting drunk with her friends and sleeping with her boyfriend. Isn't that a total waste of life? I don't hate the girls, because there are always those people who lash out at others and bring people down to hide their own insecurities. There is nothing new about it. What I find appalling is the complacency of people around them - their classmates, parents, school officials. How can these 4 teenage girls have a free rein of the school, how can they possibly influence everyone around them? It literally boggles my mind. Why every girl so eagerly calls another one a slut or psycho when she can be at any moment the recipient of the same fate? It this is not a dumb herd mentality, I don't know what is. It is a scary thing in these days of school shootings and student suicides. But I digress...I liked the book a lot, it is certainly a page turner and Samantha's road to self-awareness is compelling. However the ending is fairly unsatisfying IMO. I expected Samantha to face the consequences of her actions, to find a road to redemption, but I didn't think she would achieve this \"redemption\" so easily and would also be rewarded with a nice guy in the end. I personally don't think she ever completely owns up to her actions, never fully acknowledges her part in Juliet Sykes' demise and never confronts her friends. The whole time Samantha is more interested in hooking up with Kent than in saving a life or at least pointing to her friends the things she has learned. Whatever \"sacrifice\" she makes in the end doesn't make a difference. In reality I think everything would be on the same track the next day - bullying, vicious gossiping, taunting of Juliet by Lindsay. So, what is the point of this experience for Samantha? To convince herself she is not so bad after all because she can do a couple of nice things like giving her little sis a necklace and sending Juliet a rose? Not enough IMO.But regardless of my general disagreement with the outcome of the story, \"Before I Fall\" is a memorable novel.

(oh, i love justice. i love comeuppance) samantha is pretty and popular and easily swayed. seduced by the cult of lindsay, she forgets how to be a decent person and gets brainwashed into performing casual cruelties without even thinking about them; they become her default setting, so much so that she doesn't even remember half of them. those may be my favorite scenes, when a character is reminding samantha of some mean thing she has done and she doesn't even remember. it has become such a knee-jerk response for her - to be mean, that it is not even conscious enough for her to retain memories of it. good stuff.there are a ton of weakly-written moments/characters/subplots but there is just so much momentum to the story that you barely notice it while you are reading, and only really notice it if, say, you start sitting down to write a book review of it. the party scene/s is/are very well-written, though. i didn't drink in high school because i observed how idiotic teenagers were when intoxicated, so i never went to parties. i hosted small gatherings at my house where i would cook, let's call them \"munchies,\" for a select group of friends and everyone was calm and chill and nothing got broken and no one puked and the music was good. those party scenes terrified me.i cannot think of anything worse than a drunken teen party. even when i was a teen. i loved this book, but all the characters were awful. they are always laughing over stupid things, and you can just feel that laughter - shrill and desperate and competitive. picture that drunk. oooh, no thanks. favorite line - after a passage about clothing conformity in her school, \"it's connecticut: being like the people around you is the whole point.\" surprisingly good read.damn you, teen fiction!"}, {"userName": "hayden", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2995566-hayden", "userReview": "[Even the teacher-lust thing.

I would say 5 stars to author Lauren Oliver in taking juveniles with a blatant disregard for humanity and turning it into the story of Sam who discovers the importance of humanity. Some of the thoughts that Sam would think as she would pass from one day to the next were beautifully thoughtful causing you to question how you treat and respect the people and things we have. How do we (ourselves) treat individual people? How much affect do we have on the world (people) around us? I think it is a thought provoking book. So I would give the author 5 stars to make us question how we treat others. But all the other parts of the book, in order to get her point across, were rough and depressing to read. I struggled through the majority of the book because of these 4 teenage girls and their behavior to others. There lack of caring was sorrowing for me the reader.

So bad I deserved to die? So bad I deserved to die like THAT?Is what I did really so much worse than what anybody else does?Is it really so much worse than what YOU do?Think about it.\u201d\nSam's got everything she's ever hoped for: looks, popularity, the perfect boyfriend, and everyone at her feet. All's well as she's headed off to college in a year with her best friends, and shes finally got someone to lose her V-card too. What could go wrong? And even if something does happen, she'll always have tomorrow.Then time stops. There's no more tomorrow, no second chances, no good morning. A single night, a trail of events, strings attached together leading to this moment.Death. But Sam wakes up, again, and again, and again. Having to relive her last day in hopes that she can make things right. That maybe there's a possibility of saving herself, or at least a chance to save her soul. Writing:9.5/10Pace:7/10Message:9/10Characters & Plot:10/10I know a lot of people DID NOT like Samantha's character, which I find understandable. Some people chose not to like this novel in courtesy of people who've been bullied. I for one DID enjoy the authors message and writing. Though Samantha and I are very different individuals we are also very alike.I am not one to dive into my past, as I like to keep those memories away from my mind. I do still think it's important to share my story, for any young girls reading this novel and going through a tough time, or for the ones trying to fit in. I know both sides, I've been on the outside and on the inside of the spectrum.Back when I was twelve, I remember having a shell of confidence, which prevented me from getting teased sometimes. That is what I recalled it as, teasing. Sadly a few days ago I found my diary from when I was at that fragile age.I was not the person I was thought to be.After reading it I realized, that not only was my confidence an act, but that I was on the verge of suicide. I was being bullied. I wrote multiple entry's on how I couldn't take it anymore. How I wasn't enough, that no one liked me, I was too ugly, or too fatWhilst all this, I was already diagnosed with an eating disorder (anorexia).You see I was much like Juliet and Samantha before (Samantha was also bullied in middle school)....Later, after undergoing therapy and regaining my mental health, I moved to a new school. This was my final year of middle school, year eight.This time I vowed to no longer be the girl who was on the \"outside\". I became someone I wasn't.I wanted everyone to regret ever calling me those awful names. So that morning for school, I asked my mother to make me look \"pretty\" with makeup.It worked.I was suddenly popular. For the first time in my life, people were looking up to ME. They wanted MY friendship. I was told how \"pretty\" I was.I thought this would make me happy, but I was still the same girl. Still seeking approval, and still wanting to fit this ideal of \"perfect\". Now I could tell you what an awful person I became like Sam, but I did not. Again, I was still the same person. Unlike Sam, I didn't become the people who hurt me. I will not deny that I said some things I wish I hadn't, I lied and I even hurt people that considered me a friend. I did not though, poke fun at people's appearances, or intentionally try to hurt them.While I was \"popular\" I had all the opportunities to become the bully. Honestly, if that's what my group of friends was about, I probably would have gone along with it. Does that make me a horrid person? I guess you could judge me. But if you were only 13 and given the option to never be made fun of again, you would have taken it too....That entire year I focused on improving my social image. I made people admire me, in hopes, that maybe someday, I would see myself the way they saw me.Much like Samantha, I would sometimes look in the mirror and not recognize myself at all. How could I change so much, yet change so little? Which was what the narrator asked herself as well.Though today I am no longer that person I was back then, I still feel the imprint of my experience. I want to remind other's that being \"popular\" is not at all what it's glorified to be. You see, I was no happier than I was a few years ago, I just found a new mask to hide under. I encourage you all to look beneath the shell you've created, and possibly find, the true person which lays beneath. As I've found happiness now that I am outside those minimalist ideals, I would never return to that state. Even if you're telling yourself you would be a nice \"popular\" person, you cannot promise yourself that. I know that all too well.This book deals with the teenage mind, depression, and bullying. Usually authors either make teenagers A. act like twelve year old's or B. Like your old neighbour Frank from next door, filled with wisdom and knowledge. This novel depicts what goes on in high school and how teenagers rationalize things. It also highlights how fragile life is and how our actions affect others. The main character in \u201cBefore I Fall\u201d isn't your typical \u201crelatable\u201d lead, she's popular, and of course a teenager. These combined don't go well together. There's this thing about power, where you can use it for good or you can use it for your own good. Ms.Oliver was able to make us, or at least me sympathize with this unlikeable character. You're usually told the story from the eyes of the victim, but here you get to see it from the perpetrators point of view. I think it's important to see it from another point of view, not just the typical \u201cquiet\u201d girl. It reminds you that those people who have ever hurt you deserve a chance to change.\n\u201cHow is it possible, I think, to change so much and not be able to change anything at all?\u201d\nThis book teaches you in one way or another about things you may not have even thought about. It may be difficult for you to take in the message if you're hung up on how the main character acted before. If you open your mind, and heart you'll be able to see everything this book shares. I wish I could add every beautiful quote in this book,but that's for you to find out. \n\n\u201cThe last laugh, the last cup of coffee,\u201dthe last sunset, the last time you jump through a sprinkler, or eat an ice-cream cone, or stick your tongue out to catch a snowflake.

But I didn't. I could see Samantha changing day by day, but I never anticipated what ultimately she had to do.Oliver didn't shy away from the authenticity of the teenage persona.

So much time you can waste it.But for some of us there's only today. And the truth is, you never really know.\u201c If I had to briefly describe this book in a single sentence, I\u2019d describe it as Mean Girls meets something that\u2019ll make you thoroughly think about how you\u2019ve been treating the people around you. But I\u2019m talking about the original Mean Girls movie here, and not about that horrible second part they produced a couple of years later, because \u201cBefore I Fall\u201d was truly a great and inspiring book. \u201cBefore I Fall\u201d tells the story of Samantha Kingston who is in a fatal car accident with her friends. But instead of dying she suddenly wakes up in the morning, on the day of the accident, and can relive that day once again. This happens several times over the course of the book and she has the chance to change some of the things that happened to try to make them right again. Sam herself is your typical \u201cmean girl\u201d you know from high school chick flicks but probably also from real life (though I can\u2019t judge that since I grew up in Germany). Over here we have a different school system and the whole popular crowd that \u201crules\u201d the school thing is nothing I\u2019ve ever heard about over here. However, even I remember a time in-between seventh and ninth grade when I had my group of friends in my class and there were people we were sometimes making fun of and that we excluded from our group. Back then we thought it was funny whilst today most of us, including me, are not proud of how we treated them. But while you\u2019re acting that way you don\u2019t actually realize that you might be hurting someone with your actions and just think that they\u2019ll forget about it as fast as you do which they don\u2019t. Instead your actions might leave deeper wounds than you can imagine; wounds that might never fully heal again. \u201cBefore I Fall\u201d is trying to show what those actions can do to victims of bullying and how oblivious the offenders are to the impact of their actions. From my younger sister, I know that even at my old school, bullying has become a bit of a normal thing again. Kids these days are losing respect for not only adults but also for people their age. Back when I was in 8th grade, we read \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d which is also dealing with bullying and the consequences it can have. I remember that it actually made some people think about things they\u2019ve done in their life and led them to trying to make things right again before it might\u2019ve been too late. I think \u201cBefore I Fall\u201d is a book that could provoke the same feelings in some people and would also be a good book to read and talk about in schools. At first, I thought it wouldn\u2019t be gripping enough to also be interesting to younger readers that might have to read it for school. Reliving the same day over and over again to me sounded like a plot line that could fast become repetitive and boring; but Lauren Oliver managed to change things up in such ways that every single day was interesting in its own way. She changed things that I just didn\u2019t expect her to change at all which even made me laugh out loud a couple of times even though the chapters each ended with the same horrible event happening; it was just always a little different from how it was in the previous chapter. The book also shows the reader how complex the web of problems is which Sam and her friends have spun with their actions without even realizing it. Every time I thought I\u2019d finally understood someone\u2019s story, and knew what Sam had to change to make things right, I was immediately proven wrong again. Most of the times things aren\u2019t just made good again with a simple apology. \u201cBefore I Fall\u201d shows you this in a very gripping and moving way. It\u2019s a very realistic book which is especially shown by the ending of it which indeed makes one gulp and be silent for a couple of minutes. All in all, \u201cBefore I Fall\u201d is a great book that shines a light on a very important topic. It\u2019ll make you think about how you\u2019ve treated the people you\u2019ve encountered in your life and reading it may be an eye-opening experience for some people. Lauren Oliver has a great writing style and \u201cBefore I Fall\u201d is a book you can easily read in less than a day which also makes this book perfect for younger audiences. 4.5 out of 5 stars for this book!"}, {"userName": "Anja", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6054186-anja", "userReview": "*5 FALLING STARS*Wow. This book is beautiful. I actually really cried when it ended, and that doesn't happen a lot! I don't get why this book doesn't have higher ratings!I found Before I Fall's concept really unique. It's about a popular girl, Samantha, who dies and gets to relive her last day seven times. This book could've ended up being really clich\u00e9 but it really wasn't. You really get to see Samantha going through various stages like disbelief, anger, fear, realisation, rebelism and finally acceptance.I loved Sam's character development throughout the story. Truth be told, at the beginning she was a total bitch, but by reliving her last day seven times, she realizes everything she did wrong and tries, and succeeds, to become a better person in the end by thinking not only of herself but of other people.I can't possibly explain the millions of feelings this novel has made me feel. This story just felt so real to me, I laughed when Sam laughed, I cried when she cried, I felt hopeless, happy, afraid... It really made me think about my own life and all the things I could do better and the people I could be nicer to and that every day can be your last without you knowing.This books also deals with bullying, which is something I really hate but I loved reading about it here because it's really been like a slap in the face.

In some cultures some believe that when you die you go to the purgatory, which according to the wikepedia \"is an intermediate state after physical death in which some of those ultimately destined for heaven must first undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven\". You can say that even though she spent a long time of her life being a bitch, she could redeem herself so she could be purified and go to Heaven. Thus all the repetition happening just with her. HOWEVER, I believe that in those cultures suicide is also a sin. Okay, you can tell me \"but she wasn't killing herself, she was saving somebody\". Oh right, and that was why she was trying so hard to say her goodbyes in advance without thinking about a chance of not dying. Yeah, just right.Which gets me to the part where I believe that the main point of the sacrifice would be to leave a better life for others, a better place or at least leaving believing that she could fix something. The end was just that, death. Every info she got, died with her. The rose was a touch? Yes, but not enough to change everything. Now, think with me for a second. Imagine you are one of the girls, that get to see one of your best friends dying to save someone that you already don't like. Yeah, sure you will start linking the person.... Now, imagine you are the ex-best-friend who found out that the girl she is crushing his whole life just wants to get together and finally found about you. You see the accident.

It\u2019s in a whole different realm and I\u2019m not sure what to do. It\u2019s special. Not like in a good or bad way, but in a way that it\u2019s different. You can\u2019t compare it to anything else because\u2026it isn\u2019t like anything else. Yeah, I know I\u2019m making a lot of sense. One thing that this does is make you feel and it makes you think.Quick Overview: Samantha Kingston has everything a girl could want. She\u2019s popular, has a hunky popular boyfriend, great friends, and there seems to be no stopping her charmed life from getting even better. February 12 is Cupid\u2019s Day, a big deal for her school. She goes about the day not thinking much of anything except how many roses she\u2019ll get and feeling anxious about sleeping with boyfriend for the first time. She doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s the day she dies. The next day though she wakes up on the same exact day. She continues to live out the same day over and over. Sometimes she dies and sometimes she doesn\u2019t but she always wakes up on February 12.I REALLY did not like the beginning of this book. Sam is shallow, mean and so caught up in high school and in herself that she actually believes that everyone wants to be like her. If you aren\u2019t already popular than you obviously want to be, right? I\u2019ve moved around enough high schools to know how the rules of popularity generally work, but I think we\u2019re all smart enough to know that not EVERYONE cares about what the heck you do! No matter how popular you are. That\u2019s another thing. I\u2019m not sure if Sam and her friends are really popular or just more infamous. I rolled my eyes when she mentioned that her school was both the booziest and had the highest suicide rate. Of course it is. Her friends are cruel, stupid and have the minds of pervy middle school (and sometimes \"grown-up\") boys. And this isn\u2019t coming from a super mature person. I still laugh at stupid fart jokes. I know\u2026it\u2019s sad. One of the days she does really inappropriate stuff. I\u2019m mean REEEALLY!!! Like she just goes around thinking about what are the most ridiculous, stupid, illegal things possible? You see the good in Sam and her friends but then it\u2019s overshadowed by their sheer stupidness. This is everything I thought during the first half of the book. I didn\u2019t actually start to like it until page 262. If I could rate these separately I\u2019d give the first half a big fat slap in the face, and the other half a gold medal with 5 huge shiny stars.The second half of the book is where you really start to feel something other than annoyed sympathy and anger towards Sam and her friends. Even though you get to know the characters during the first half, the second half is where you see their real vulnerability. And even if Sam\u2019s friends are cruel and annoying they care about each other. You see how much Sam\u2019s thinking has changed and how much she\u2019s grown. The only thing that made me push through the first half is that I knew that there had to be a point where Sam finally got it. That she finally understands she isn\u2019t reliving the same day for no reason. That she was meant to do something. There are some truly beautiful moments in here. You just want to cry at how simple and perfect they are. The moments with her sister Izzy and with Kent especially. 90%(okay maybe less, there's other good stuff too) of why I loved the second half was because of Kent. There is a reason why everyone is in love with him. He\u2019s our hero. The message of the book is really brought home at the end, which is not happy. It\u2019s very bittersweet. To really understand what the book is all about though, it\u2019s the only way it could\u2019ve ended. It\u2019s amazing though that the author can bring hope to something that seems so final, and how Sam finds a way to truly save herself.Even though the first half of the book is not the type of stuff I generally like (i.e. unlikable main characters, perverted jokes, and scenes that get pretty darn close to going THERE) the writing is beautiful throughout. It makes you ask yourself questions: What is it that you\u2019re taking for granted? What memories do you want to leave? What are your \u201cgreatest hits\u201d? This book breaks your heart, makes you want to yell, enjoy the stillness and silence of the world, grab the sun\u2019s rays, and sit bathing under the glow of the moon. It makes you realize and remember all the beautiful things that we don\u2019t even notice. Just heartbreakingly beautiful. You have to give a book major kudos for doing all that. Even if the main characters friends are pervy."}, {"userName": "Lorenzio Phillibuster Fireworks", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5133545-lorenzio-phillibuster-fireworks", "userReview": "But before you start pointing fingers, let me ask you: is what I did really so bad? So bad I deserved to die? So bad I deserved to die like that? Is what I did really so much worse than what anyone else does? Is it really so much worse than what you do?Think about it. I did think about it. I was forced to think about it for 341 pages. My answer is yes, what you did is worse than what a lot of people do, and what's worse is that at the end of your little week of revelations, I still don't believe you're actually sorry that you tormented a classmate into suicide. Lauren Oliver makes an okay attempt. Don't be a bully. Don't be a shallow, empty bitch. But she should have chosen a different medium for her message. The entire novel I was wondering \"Why Sam?\" What can possibly be so different between her and the other three identically empty girls of her group that SHE deserved the chance to \"redeem herself\" while the other four didn't. Why didn't Lauren Oliver feel the need to have the OTHER girls in the group, and let's face it, the rest of the school that bullied Juliet Sykes to ALSO learn the consequences of their actions. What's worst of all, to me, is that Sam was once on the receiving end of Lindsay's cruelty. It was not anywhere near the same extent to which Juliet was tormented, but it was still more of an understanding than others. Everytime she made someone terrified they'd even mentioned the name of her boyfriend, or she reminded someone that she shouldn't even know their name or sent Juliet a Valentines rose to remind her that she didn't have friends, or a boyfriend to send one to her. Her defence to all of this is I didn't do anything; I just followed along(pg 135) as if this somehow excuses the years of cruel behaviour to others. There's also the part on pg 136 where she blames her parents for her being stupid enough to get drunk, get into a car with her friends who are also blind drunk and in no condition to drive, and blame them for the resulting accident. What else could she possibly expect to happen? There's a reason why drunk driving is a crime and high school bodies try to so hard to educate students against such stupidity. Let's then continue the blame game and say it's all Lindsay's fault. Lindsay didn't do any of those things on her own, she had three people - Sam, Elody and Ally - to spread her rumours, help her create them, to encourage her cruelty and enforce the belief that this is just what happens, SOMEONE has to be picked on, so at the end of the day Juliet should just accept it because it is apparantly the law that someone has to. (This is actually something she says early on in the novel.) Her apology to Juliet on pg 277 is not at all sincere and heartfelt, and I believe by the end of the book that she still had a long way to go. I honestly don't understand why Lauren Oliver hasn't made the other three girls go through the same education that Sam does. After all, when Sam is dead the others will still be there, continuing everything they did before without any pause for thought. I also can't understand how she can think it's okay that Sam, knowing she will not survive the night, starts a relationship with Kent, a boy who has been in love with her for years, without consideration for how much it would affect him. This is a strong indication of how selfish Sam still is, and that I don't feel she has learnt what she was meant to, and that therefore the message she's sending is more convoluted that it could be."}, {"userName": "Elise (TheBookishActress)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52545435-elise-thebookishactress", "userReview": "If you look through bad reviews of this book, you'll start to see a common trend: a dislike for Samantha as a protagonist. And it won't be hard to understand why - this book is about a high school mean girl, and she does some incredibly messed up things within these pages. But here's the thing - Samantha's despicable nature is what makes the book so good. Because her story is one of redemption, of working through what she has done and making herself better. Some won't like it, perhaps, but this is undoubtedly one of the best character-driven novels I have ever read. Samantha's character arc is incredible. I'd go so far to call it one of my all-time favorite arcs. She starts out as a very typical protagonist, one you wouldn't even bat your eyes at, yet she develops into such an incredibly sympathetic character. Even at her moments of imperfection, of blunt evil, even, she wins your empathy because we have been there. The narrative is so effortlessly unbiased towards her - her mistakes are questioned, yet her redemption is given the space it needs. Even ignoring Samantha, every character feels so real and dimensional. It would've been easy to make Lindsey, Samantha's best friend, into a bland and pathetic mean girl. It would've been easy to make Juliet into a one-off unpopular girl. But Oliver avoids all these traps and makes all her side characters complicated. \nI read once that at the edge of a black hole, time stops completely, so if you ever sailed into it, you\u2019d just be stuck there at the lip forever, forever being torn apart, forever dying.\nIt's important to mention that this book isn't about logic. Lauren Oliver doesn't care how this time loop is happening, or why - she cares about how it's affecting these characters, and that's exactly what's so great about Before I Fall. Every sentence felt like a knife in my heart, making me feel so much for Samantha and for every other character. This book is about self-sacrifice and courage and doing the right thing. It's not preachy, yet it's not sugar coated. Every part of this book is so real, and so true to life, despite the unrealistic plot. You can feel every emotion. VERDICT: It is incredibly sad that Oliver has come out with so much which wasn't as great as this. However, this novel, her debut, is still absolutely worth reading - it's one of the most impactful books I've ever read. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Lilou", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36218182-lilou", "userReview": "first of all, i like to say that this book is amazingly written. in the beginning of the book you just think ah it is just a normal book about teenagers and their life, but there i was wrong. When the accident happend I didn't expect that she was going to live the same day over and over again. i found it really funny she was so confused about everything. Then she is like fuck it i'm going to do bad thing nobody is going to remember it anyway. Furthermore I love how Sam is changing in a caring person. She just can't live her own silly life anymore and she realized that you have to know someone before you can judge them. I have to say that Lindsey is such a bitch and I hate her with every piece of my heart. i also find it weird that Sam tells like tiny details about her friend in the end. i mean i wanted to know that when the story started. BUT THE ENDING WAS LIKE SO SO UNEXPECTED AND AMAZING. I just tought she was going to go back to life when she was finished with what she wantend to do but no she just died and the Juliet part damn. This book is worth reading i tell ya."}], "description": "What if you had only one day to live? What would you do? Who would you kiss?
