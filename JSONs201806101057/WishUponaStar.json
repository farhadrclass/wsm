She's already feeling nervous, because her ex, Russell Saxton, owner of both Pleasure Island and research facility Saxton Technologies, has been showing more interest in Skye lately and she's worried about what that might mean. Russell's a powerful man, and in Ceri's own words has \"mad-scientist-criminal mastermind tendencies and total moral and ethical ineptitude.\" Before meeting up with her ex, however, Ceri encounters someone she wants to see even less--Jason Crickett, the man who had left her at the altar eight years earlier.Jason's come to see Russell too--to convince him to release Jason's dead brother's body to his family so they can give him a decent burial. He enlists Ceri's reluctant help, and the two are soon thrown into a series of events that quickly spirals out of control. Their love should have died years ago--but can Jason and Ceri survive the next two hours?The action scenes in this novella read like a crazy rollercoaster ride. Human cyborgs, zombies, bitter exes with armed lackeys--this story has them all, complete with the threat of total destruction via military bombing--and the clock is ticking! To say it keeps you on the edge of your seat is an understatement.I like couples-with-a-history stories, and given the space limitations in a novella, couples with a prior relationship often feature prominently in them. Bring on the angst and drama! This story definitely delivers on it, though a bit too much of it is revealed through Ceri's internal dialogue, which definitely leans toward the melodramatic. Between it and the long stretches of bordering-on-soliloquy internal and external dialogue, readers are left with a bit of a \"feast or famine\" feeling. Over-the-top action! Long internal monologue. More action! Scene where Ceri reveals every single detail of her past eight years to Jason in a few short pages. More balance was definitely needed.For all that was going on here--or maybe because of it--parts of the resolution feel rushed. Larger-than-life antagonists are quickly dispatched. (I kept waiting for one of them in particular to show up later on, surviving against all odds much like the Twinkies in the Chevy Silverado Superbowl commercial. It didn't happen.) Seemingly insurmountable relationship hurdles suddenly smooth out. Ceri and Jason go from haven't-spoken-in-years to HEA in less than twenty-four hours; even during a possible zombie apocalypse, it's a bit much.In a nutshell: an entertaining read, but too uneven to be altogether satisfying.

Russell was the owner of Saxton Technologies and Peter's father was a research scientist there. \"Despite federal regulations forbidding the testing of cyborg prosthetics on human subjects...Peter had become the world's only living cyborg, more machine than man, but still...a living, breathing, functioning member of society.\"Peter had become \"Russell's lead henchman, he most likely did all of Russell's dirty work.\" Now that Peter is dead, Russell will not give the Crickett family Peter's body, saying the body belonged to him because he was more cyborg parts than human. But Peter's father and brother were worried. Max Crickett \"had been working on some sort of microchip that was supposed to help repair function to damaged brains. It was still experimental, but Russell implanted it in Peter's brain.\" Max and his other son, Jason, believe Russell modified Peter's behavior to do his bidding that lead up to his death and they wanted to prove it.After Peter's accident and three days before his wedding, Jason Crickett left Ceri McKinley. In her grieving, Ceri met Russell who made her feel wanted. She got pregnant and they ended up marrying Russell. But after she watched Russell break the hands of a piano player she made small talk with, she divorced him.Now Ceri is at Pleasure Island to meet with Russell to discuss visitation rights for their daughter, Skye. She runs into Max and Jason who told her of their trials. They were hoping Ceri could talk to Russell and convince him to release Peter's body. Ceri knew Russell would not listen to her but she will try anyway. Because she never stopped loving Jason.I GIVE THIS BOOK: 4 StarsI love zombie stories and this book jacks it up a notch that I did not see coming.I had a little trouble visualizing the climb up the puppet because I have never seen a puppet three stories tall.But this book kept me captivated from the beginning straight to the end.

But when she walked into his office, she certainly wasn't expecting a chain of events that would set into motion the potential for a second zombie apocalypse.'It was like some twisted game of Spin-the-Bottle, only instead of a kiss the winner got their face eaten off.'Ceri's ex-fiance Jason and his father spot her there before everything goes awry, and plead with her to help them find a family member so they can put things to rest. Unfortunately, her ex-husband has other plans. Before they have time to process what's happening, they are fighting for their lives and in a mad dash to make it to safety.'Maybe one of these days I'd get it through my thick skull that wishes hardly ever came true. Even when they did, they usually didn't turn out the way you wanted.'Wish Upon a Star is an action-packed zombie romance (yep, you heard me right) that is full of danger, sarcasm and regrets. Released just in time for the Halloween season, this is the perfect addition to your TBR list. It is definitely not for the weak-of-stomach as there are some gruesome details...I mean, it is about zombies! But there is also a wonderful thread of longing and love between Ceri and Jason woven into the plot.I really enjoyed Michelle's writing style. The descriptions of the situations and characters were spot on and made it every bit as interesting to me as an actual zombie movie would be. There was even a touch of humor mixed in to balance everything out. Even though it is a short novel, there is still a lot of depth to Ceri and Jason's history and feelings. My only gripe is that I wish it was a longer story! I'd love to get more of the backstory that brought them to where they are now and to see what the future holds for them.I'd definitely recommend this for horror lovers who want to try something with a different twist to it, or even for romance lovers who want to try out a new genre.

I do not read anything that sounds like it may lean toward horror, but since this is also a romance story I wanted to see what it was about. I\u2019m so glad I read this. It\u2019s a really good action packed story that kept me reading until the end because I could not wait to find out what would happen next. Ceri McKinley is in the process of visiting the offices of her ex-husband to discuss a legal matter when Jason, her ex-fianc\u00e9e shows up asking for her help. She has never stopped loving Jason and would love to have him in her life again, but she has no idea what she can do to help him. Once she hears his request she finally agrees to help him even though she feels like her involvement will not make a difference in Russell decision.Jason Crickett\u2019s brother was killed in a robbery gone bad, so Jason only wants to purchase Peter\u2019s body from Russell, the man who now owns him after keeping him alive years ago by the use of mechanical body parts. After all, he\u2019s dead, so there is no reason that the man needs him now, and if he wants the body parts he put in Peter he can have them. But Jason\u2019s plans are not going as easy as he thought. When Ceri gets him into Russell\u2019s office neither one of them expected to see what was in front of their eyes. Zombies start taken over the building they are in, and now Jason and Ceri are fighting for their lives. Jason also plans to prove to Ceri that he regrets leaving her because he has never stopped loving her, and he will spend the rest of their lives proving it to her.

Oh who am I kidding - this was not a normal scenario. Ex-wife, Ceri, going to see ex-husband, Russell, about his visitation with their daughter Skye. Runs into ex-fiance, Jason, and his father, Max, who also wants to see her ex-husband - to try to get the body of his brother Peter back. Peter was hurt on the night of Jason's bachelor party - only Jason had opted to spend the evening with Ceri. He feels that Peter's accident would not have happened if he hadn't stayed with Ceri. Russell had used some experimental procedures on Peter and had saved his life but made him a cyborg in the process. His cyborg half-life had been snuffed out during an attempted robbery in which he was shot and killed. Or so everyone thought. As Ceri, Jason and Max soon learn, Russell has reanimated Peter and turned him into a zombie - one with a chip in his head to do Russell's bidding. The situation goes from bad to worse. Peter infects the secretary, who starts a zombie outbreak. Russell is killed by none other than Peter, and Ceri and Jason find themselves locked into Russell's safe room. At least from there they can get out the word about the outbreak and get them some help. That help turns out to be the military planning to bomb the establishment in two hours. This would be okay except that Ceri has seen her mother and daughter huddled under a desk in Russell's office on the top floor. The true story starts here as Jason and Ceri set off to rescue them through a zombie infested building.This one had a lot of suspense and was an interesting take on the outbreak of zombies.

This was a very short read that takes place over only a few hours. The relationship is sort of already established (they had experienced love and loss) now it was just getting back together so they could get their HEA. Was the road easy? Nope. Only thing in their way was a crazy ex husband, a cyborg brother, and a few newly created zombies. No pressure right?!As I was reading, I kept having the thought, this could be a great book if the zombies where muggers, kidnappers or renegade weres. Hmmmm weres....that is something I could sink my teeth into. I don't mind a good zombie apocalypse romance book now and then, but so much more could have been done here. This did have lots of action....zombie killing...climbing giant puppets....hair spray flame throwers but it all happened so fast it was over in almost a blink. Which now that I think about it, may not be a bad thing. As for the romance, that was quick too since it was basically just saying...\"I'm sorry\" and \"I forgive you\" now lets jump in bed (or have sex in the arsenal room while my mom and daughter are in the bedroom and they can come in at any time.)I did like the cover, very pretty (even if it did have blood dripping down the wall). The couple looked cute but the cover does not fit the story line. But then, not sure what could have been done really...maybe shown the shelves from the arsenal room in the back drop or the elevator shaft.Would I recommend this book? Maybe, if you have a few hours to kill.Would I read more from this author? Yes.

Oh my! That is the unexpected set up for Wish Upon a Star, and it's a good one! Ceri is spending the day with her daughter and mother at Pleasure Island before heading to a meeting with her ex-husband to discuss custody and visitation. Then she runs into her ex-fiance, Jason, who also happens to be there to talk to her ex-husband about a few things. It turns out that Russell is holding his dead brother's body hostage, for some unknown and probably nefarious reasons. Jason's brother was the first successful cyborg patient after being in an accident, but now that he's met his final death, Jason just wants to put him to rest. Ceri agrees to help Jason talk to Russell about returning the body, but Russell has some other plans for them.Wish Upon a Star was super fun! It's fast paced, action packed, and is topped off with some steamy romance. This is how novellas should be! And zombie cyborgs? Awesome! Ceri and Jason spend most of the 80ish pages fighting zombies, running for their lives, and trying to save her daughter. They also work through their past problems in order to rekindle their relationship, but that was less interesting than the impending zombie apocalypse. Wish Upon a Star uses the ol' race against the clock cliche to keep the story moving, but I definitely think it works. Ceri and Jason have only 2 hours to make their way from the basement to the top floor of the hotel, keeping zombies at bay along the way, grab her daughter and mother, then make it back down to the safe room before the military blows the building to smithereens!Read more of my reviews at Pinkindle Reads & Reviews."}, {"userName": "Heather  book whore & shifter slut extrordinaire", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14490451-heather-book-whore-shifter-slut-extrordinaire", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.I am not a fan of zombies. AT ALL. I don't watch them on TV. I don't usually enjoy reading zombie/apocalyptic books. AT ALL. Having said all that, I signed up for this and one other zombie/apocalyptic book. Why? Why would I do this? What made me think that I would enjoy these zombie books? The answer - the side story.I am a total sucker (no pun intended) for a Happily Ever After, especially one of a couple that has been torn apart by circumstances or the interference of others. And that's what this book looks like it is. Ceri and Jason had their HEA and their life together all planned out. It started with getting married. But three days before the wedding Jason had a family emergency and walked out on her. Gone. Now he's back and its not only for her. He needs her to help him fix the reason he left her in the first place, his brother. The person he chose over her. How does he get her to see how sorry he is? How does he convince her he won't do it again - he won't ever choose anyone or anything over her. In the end, partly because of his father Max, she says yes.In their world there has already been one zombie uprising and humanity barely survived. Since then the serum that was used to reanimate the dead and all the research had been outlawed and destroyed. But there will always be those out there in any world who believe the rules are made for others, that they do not apply to them.

And told in first person, I was given front row seats to watch this disaster unfold.The attraction between Ceri (the story teller) and Jason (her ex-fiance) is beautifully woven into this short story without detracting from the main event: survive the zombies so they can find Ceri's daughter and mother, then make it back to a safe room before the military wipes out the building to stop the infected from leaving.

The title. The title is by far the hardest part as an author. But this one does not represent the book to me in anyway. Had I not read the blurb I would have expected a magical book - not an apocalyptic type. For me, I was torn between the review for this book because I believe in making a book cohesive and this one from the title and the cover does not properly market itself. I am giving it 2.5 stars as the characters were a little flat as well and I feel anyone drawn in by the title or cover would possibly stop reading after the miss marketing.Now onto the contents on the inside of the book. This is a continuation and I had a little trouble following certain things as I had no knowledge of that but not enough to say it hampered the experience. The book itself for it's small size was quite good. The action was plausible and the plot had my attention. The characters needed help in my opinion to stand out. They felt very flat but did have moments of complete sizzle and realism."}, {"userName": "Tanya Vought", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3638565-tanya-vought", "userReview": "This was a short paranormal romance story between Ceri and Jason.

A lot of things. Including: a Pinocchio homage, a zombie adventure, a tiger-mother story, a romance novel. And all in less than a hundred pages. It's a tall order, and for the most part I felt like the story was...perfunctory. Insert last name \"Crickett\" here. Insert zombie attack here. Insert cliffhanger here. Insert plot moppet here. Insert tearful love scene here. And they all lived happily ever after the end.It wasn't painful to read, and it's so short that it's readable in just an hour or two, but it also wasn't inspired. The zombies are pretty standard. The characters are pretty standard. The love scene is pretty standard. And the Pinocchio stuff seemed jammed in with no rhyme or reason. Call a casino Pleasure Island, put a giant marionette in the middle of it, and have your plot moppet wish really hard, and evidently it's Pinocchio all over.It's not for me, but it helped me get closer to my reading goal for the year.

It started a bit slow for me, but when they got into Ceri\u2019s ex-husbands offices the action started and didn\u2019t stop. The story basically revolves around Ceri and Jason trying to save her daughter during a zombie outbreak. While fighting their way up the building and back they both wonder what if? Do they try again? Ceri hasn\u2019t seen Jason for five years, ever since he called of their wedding. In those years she married a very crazy man and divorced him. Ceri is still tied to him through their daughter and that\u2019s how she ends up in an office with her ex-husband and ex-fianc\u00e9. Yep, it\u2019s as awkward as it sounds.Overall it\u2019s a fairly good short story full of action with a bit of romance. It\u2019s well written and the characters are fully developed. My only issue with it is the ending. It just abruptly ended; it felt more like a HFN instead of a HEA.
