The book is divided into three parts and the third part is what the title suggested. The first part were important to get the reader to understand the most important factor of the story, but it took long because of the way the book is titled."}, {"userName": "Jessica Injejikian", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6359461-jessica-injejikian", "userReview": "I love this monograph! Lassiter effectively connects the grassroots movements of white, middle-class suburbans in Atlanta and Charlotte to the conservative shift in American national political discourse, revising the previous and popular \"top-down\" historical explanation for this shift. This work challenges and complicates many accepted historical understandings and all points are thoroughly connected...giving the sense that these well-supported truths (by the work of previous historians, yet largely by a significant amount of primary sources such as newspapers, legal transcripts, interviews, and speeches) should be obvious to Americans, speaking to the strength of The Silent Majority.Strongly recommend for anyone interested in the Right's response to the Civil Rights Movement/Freedom Struggle, a perspective of history sadly understudied and clearly not understood by the majority of Americans. Allows significant insight into our current political climate!"}, {"userName": "Piker7977", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3571033-piker7977", "userReview": "The first 60 pages or so were slow going. Lassiter does a great job of examining how grassroots movements involving the integration and desegregation of school influenced the \"silent majority\" in the cities of Atlanta, Charlotte, and Richmond. Most fascinating is his conclusions regarding the political legacy of the Sunbelt region. Well worth the read to gain insight on the behaviors of southern middle-class whites during the late 1960s and early 1970s."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/717438-megan", "userReview": "An engaging study of the school desegregation/busing debate in Charlotte, NC, during the 1970s.

The Silent Majority provides the first regionwide account of the suburbanization of the South from the perspective of corporate leaders, political activists, and especially of the ordinary families who lived in booming Sunbelt metropolises such as Atlanta, Charlotte, and Richmond. Matthew Lassiter examines crucial battles over racial integration, court-ordered busing, and housing segregation to explain how the South moved from the era of Jim Crow fully into the mainstream of national currents. During the 1960s and 1970s, the grassroots mobilization of the suburban homeowners and school parents who embraced Richard Nixon's label of the Silent Majority reshaped southern and national politics and helped to set in motion the center-right shift that has dominated the United States ever since.The Silent Majority traces the emergence of a \"color-blind\" ideology in the white middle-class suburbs that defended residential segregation and neighborhood schools as the natural outcomes of market forces and individual meritocracy rather than the unconstitutional products of discriminatory public policies. Connecting local and national stories, and reintegrating southern and American history, The Silent Majority is critical reading for those interested in urban and suburban studies, political and social history, the civil rights movement, public policy, and the intersection of race and class in modern America.", "title": "The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South\n      \n          (Politics and Society in Twentieth-Century America)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345082.The_Silent_Majority", "average": 3.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1173918713l/345082.jpg", "reviews": 11, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/197966.Matthew_D_Lassiter", "name": "Matthew D.
