It was excellently written and it did what it was supposed to do...it scared the crap out of me. This is a character study of a social deviant. I don't want to spoil this for anyone who reads it, so I won't give away the ending, but definitely not something you read while lying on the beach catching your tan. No escapism here. You come face to face with the evil and cunning of the sociopathic and psychotic mind. Be prepared to bathe in Dettol and then curl up in bed under the covers next to your favorite stuffed animal with your thumb in your mouth, your night light on and your mommy on the phone 'til you go to sleep when you finish reading it. Kudos to Joyce Carol Oates for what I consider a brave, realistic creepy and excellently executed foray into the criminal mind.

I dunno, it seems like taking the easy option to me - you takes your Jeffrey Dahmer (you remember him, he was a lonely boy who wanted a gay sex pet to do his every bidding, and he read a book on brain surgery and he thought that if you drilled the right hole in a man's head it would stop him from realising you were a dangerous psycho and leaving, so he practised on a few guys who unfortunately like died which was not Jeffrey's intention, but he was practising, you can't get these things right first time - okay, okay, I know this hobby of Jeffrey's is probably politically incorrect but he was a boy with problems) - anyway, Joyce takes Jeffrey and renames him Quentin, rearranges a few details, adds plenty of stuff which wouldn't have got into the papers (Quentin does his DIY drilling, Quentin mucks about with his deceased boyfriends, Quentin gets in a towering rage with them because they die too quick and don't co-operate at all, yes, a bit sick, true, but only .5 on the American Psycho scale) and then writes the whole thing like it's Quentin's semiliterate journal full of VERY ANGRY CAPITALS and zany punctuation and endearing little hand drawings (how to drill your zombie correctly). Now then, I've read \"What I Lived For\" and I know Joyce Carol Oates can write like a living goddess so that means she can churn out this Zombie kind of stuff before she's finished her morning muesli. I think someone must have drilled a hole in Joyce's head."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36555254-robin", "userReview": "A ruthless, blindingly-ugly, revealing character study of a sexual psychopath.Joyce Carol Oates, I now officially forgive you for the tedium of We Were the Mulvaneys. This book was all that Mulvaneys was NOT - brilliantly written, brave, and (maybe most importantly) brief.It became clear to me after reading this book that Quentin P is based at least loosely on real life serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, which is interesting from a historical perspective. But I enjoyed reading this being clueless about that background. I was immediately pulled into this story because the voice of Quentin, the main character / freak-of-nature is so strong and believable. We are privy to his journal in which capital letters abound as well as ampersands (no \"and\" can be found anywhere in these 181 pages). He also includes creepy drawings of eyes, ice picks, even a do-it-yourself-lobotomy-diagram. He describes his depraved desires to turn a human being into his own personal ZOMBIE, who would passively and mindlessly do his bidding, in a shocking, twisted narrative. Oates goes where few people would. She spares no one, some parts almost too sick for even me to read. There is no safe place to rest in this novella, no respite, no mercy. No mercy, perhaps, until you close the book, and find that you are secure in your own killer-free existence, with comfortable things like morals and conscience floating around nearby.But therein lays the brilliance. She captures the character's mind with razor sharp accuracy, brings you there for just as long as you can stand, then sets you free."}, {"userName": "Raymond", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/846856-raymond", "userReview": "Damn, Joyce, I didn't know you rolled like that."}, {"userName": "LeAnne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-leanne", "userReview": "Short, dark, and very scary - like a tipsy 2am Uber ride home that instead drags you into macabre neighborhoods and makes you question exactly what your ultimate payment will be (and maybe whether somebody slipped a touch of rohypnol in your margarita). Things are OFF. Way OFF.So. You up for being freaked out and mesmerized for 200 pages?? Do yourself a favor and do NOT read the publisher's blurb or other reviews. I walked into this book entirely blind and assumed because of the title that I'd see dead people a la World War Z. The only reason I read it was that a trusted GR friend wanted to do a buddy read. I really don't like dystopian books or vampires or zombies, but doing one of those type books by this author? OMG. There is no way I'd do that voluntarily. Robin - it was only our friendship that made me agree.Boy, was I wrong! I am a total idiot (which you possibly already knew). The only title I was able to associate with Joyce Carol Oates was 'We Were the Mulvaneys,' a book I've never read but somehow pre-judged as a warm, family relationship fest that was far too milk-n-honey for me to take interest. I had no CLUE she was a HORROR writer and also was nominated for a Pulitzer.Better than that, there is not a single walking dead person in the entire book. No dystopian plague or exorcists in sight. The book puts you in the shoes of a reprehensible character, and because some of the events in his life seem like they were inspired by true events. the reader gawks on - wondering how much of this story line might be real. Because, friends, it is VERY realistic!October and Halloween are coming up, and while this is a short book, it is so disturbingly creepy that 200 pages is plenty. No rohypnol will allow me to forget ZOMBIE.

It does not take us \"into the mind of a serial killer.\" It is not \"harrowing,\" and it's not \"disturbing.\" It is a strained and earnest attempt to imagine the kind of life that would decisively overturn bourgeois values. But it doesn't do that, because the imagining of the Other is already part of middle-class American life. Even the most surprising lines pale as soon as they're read, because it becomes clear that they are imagined by a novelist, working in an upper-middle class suburb, with the help of years of research into serial killers. If Oates really wants to write outside of modern middle class America, she should write like Perec, or Roussel, or Bernhard. Those are three very different examples, but they share two crucial traits that show how awkward and artificial \"Zombie\" is: first, they are decisively outside bourgeois values (their characters are the real psychotics, the ones who really don't care about the social fabric); and second, they don't have to work so hard, with every line and image, trying to break out of normalcy. They are already irreparably abnormal."}, {"userName": "Heidi Ward", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4751840-heidi-ward", "userReview": "I generally like Oates's dark fiction (her short stories are particularly good), but I chose not to finish this one. I'd meant to read Zombie for a long time, and was disappointed to find it utterly repulsive when I finally got around to it . . . but not in the way you might imagine.I thought I knew what I was getting into when I picked up a book told from the POV of a sexually depraved serial killer dabbling in icepick lobotomies. (Browse my library and you'll see it takes a lot more than that to put me off my feed.) I guess I imagined that Oates of all people would be able to tap that \"nothing human is alien\" vein, and give the reader some interesting insights into her narrator's disturbing psychology. Unfortunately, what the reader gets instead is the raving-yet-vacuous diary of an emotionally stunted, sexually-obsessed sociopath who frequently WRITES IN ALL CAPS to add emphasis. He also draws cute pictures of his potential victims to accompany his \"romantic\" fantasies. (Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised to find he carries his tools in a Hello Kitty backpack.) What's really repulsive is that \"Q_P_\" (as he self-identifies) may just be the most vapid serial killer of all time. Maybe the novel ends with a stunning flourish, but here's one reader who simply got tired of spending any more time in such unscintillating company.To sum up, my disappointment with Zombie has nothing to do with its graphic nature, and everything to do with the fact that its protagonist is not only unlikeable but as banal as an adolescent girl with a crush. I know Oates can write beautifully, so what's the point of writing badly in this case? If you really want to get inside a serial killer's head, might I suggest spending the time with Patrick Bateman in Brett Easton Elllis's far superior and pitch-black funny American Psycho instead?"}, {"userName": "juan carlos", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22131351-juan-carlos", "userReview": "Amantes de los asesinos y psicopatas, esta es su novela.

I'm not going to write much more about this because I've got other books waiting for me tonight, but what I will say is that you should only read ZOMBIE if you have a strong stomach.

In her novel, Zombie, (1995), she writes in a first person narrative of a psychopath who has a crush on various youthful men, and uses devilish means to capture them and use them as sex slaves. In turns, quizzically funny and nasty, the writings are merely scribbles and with various doodles in the borders that take on sinister meanings as you read the story. As a reader I am a little put off by various means of initials and symbols and not LOL in the course of this clever novelette. It is very good but not one of her best works. She borrows from various writers like Kurt Vonnegut, a known scribbler and a doodler and from Antoine De Saint-Exepury, The Little Prince except at her twisted and darkest. The narrator is brilliant at manipulations by taking care of his grandmother and friends in between. He uses a clever way to hatch a scheme to catch his latest prize, a blond All American teenager with the right amount of ponytail, and thin tight muscles. She is brilliant when writing from another gender, including her descriptions of what it is like to have a raging hard on.

Anyone who knows me well knows that I have a bit of an obsession with serial killers. So after a conversation about Jeffrey Dahmer the other day (yes, the glamorous life of a psych grad student), I recalled a former lit professor having mentioned this evilly wonderful novel by Joyce Carol Oates, one of the underappreciated literary greats. The novel\u2019s protagonist happens to be based heavily on Dahmer, who had similar zombie-making inclinations. I read it in about two days flat. And wish it had been longer so I didn\u2019t have to stop reading. Don\u2019t let the \u201cliterary\u201d scare you. It\u2019s not flowery. It\u2019s not that Victorian stuff your teacher made you read in high school. Oates writes in a vocabulary accessible to any reader. Except children. Because it would scar them. Like American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis, it takes you into the mind of a killer. Only this killer is no suave Patrick Bateman. He\u2019s sometimes grandiose, sometimes na\u00efve, sometimes childish\u2014to the point that you find yourself cheering him on halfway through only to catch yourself and say, Wait. Bad C.J. Stop supporting the serial killer. But that\u2019s the power of Oates\u2019 empathic portrait. You can hate him, fear him, and feel for him at the same time. Not many books can do that, eh? Plot-wise, it\u2019s not going to be your average crime novel. It jumps around a bit and keeps you guessing. It\u2019s not a blood-and-guts sort of story. But Oates\u2019 descriptions are so perfect (for example, \"My whole body is a numb tongue.\") that you feel every sensation, from Quentin\u2019s queer psychopathic glee to the sharp point of that ice pick. The ending was less satisfying, but it left the chills it was no doubt intended to. If you have a strong stomach, read it.

The owner/writer of this diary is Quentin P. (who frequently refers to himself by initials alone, and to others solely by initials or - in special cases - cutesy nicknames).

In short, Q_ P_ wants to have his own sexual \"zombie\" and goes through the motions of everyday life as much as he dilligently researches the methodology of creating such an entity. A mindless drone to worship him, to willingly grant whatever he requests, all without seeing him from behind their dull, unthinking eyes.Clearly based on the crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer, this anti-heroic tale presents the sickeningly obsessive impulses of the modern serial killer in a way so few other works of fiction have: as seen from the absolute inside. To call it \"unsettling\" does not adequately portray the horrors awaiting the reader within this slim tome.

Or several showers.Joyce Carol Oates seems to really like to do this thing in her work where she fictionalizes big news stories or real people's lives and works them into a novel. Some of her most popular and acclaimed books fall into this category, like Black Water and Blonde. In Zombie, we are introduced to Quentin P., an obvious stand-in for serial killer and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer, this short novel's narrator who is obsessed with creating a \"ZOMBIE\" (i.e., someone to be his completely subservient sexual partner).Getting inside the mind of a deranged psychopath is usually fascinating. We all love Hannibal Lecter, right? But Quentin lacks all the charm that makes Dr. Lecter and other characters like him so appealing to audiences. Reading this book was, for me, the literary equivalent of watching Hostel or The Human Centipede 2. For anyone who can't relate, basically there was a lot of grimacing and wishing certain scenes would stop. There is a message that Oates is trying to communicate here that has the potential to be powerful, but it loses its punch for a couple of reasons: 1) it's the same message she and dozens of other writers are always fixated on, which is \"Upper-class, white Americans can actually be pretty screwed up, and it means even more coming from me because I myself am an upper-class, white American!\"; and 2) Quentin constantly going on about Time or medical procedures or giant erections makes it difficult to think about any kind of \"subtext.\"All of that said, I don't hate this book. I think Oates set out to create a psychopathic character, and clearly she's accomplished that, at the very least. I would even say that if you're into the whole grotesque, icky, squirm-inducing thing in either books or films, you would probably really enjoy this and I encourage you to pick it up. If you're more into anti-heroes or sympathetic villains you can love to hate, I would suggest either giving this one a pass or, if you're determined to read it, just going in with caution. And if you're just looking for a book about a zombie outbreak, turn around now and don't look back because you are barking up the wrong tree."}, {"userName": "Jacobi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/728350-jacobi", "userReview": "This book made me angry. I understand that Joyce Carol Oates writes books that make you feel like you need a shower, and I was cool with that. I expected it even. What I didn't expect was for this to be written like drivel. An excerpt.\"Twelve years old & in seventh grade & now I was wearing glasses & long-armed & skinny & hair sprouting under my arms & at my groin & their eyes sliding onto me & even the teachers & in gym class I refused to go through the shower refused to go naked moving through them & their cocks glistening & scratching their chests, bellies & some of them so muscular, so good-loking & laughing like apes not guessing except if seeing me & my eyes I couldn't keep still darting & swimming among them like minnows if seeing me they knew & their faces would harden with disgust QUEER QUEER QUENTIN'S QUEER & that time Dad charged upstairs to get me where I was doing homework in my room & yanked me by the arm & downstairs & into the garage & showed me the Body Builder magazines & the naked Ken-doll from the playground I'd brought back hidden behind stacks of old newspapers & he'd found his face splotched & furious & at that time Dad did wear a goateee like Dr. M_ K_'s & this too livid with outrage.\"This was on page 38. This is when I said fuck this book. This is where it took everything I had not to throw this things across the break-room to get it away from me. I understand that Oates is writing from the perspective of a sociopath, but this writing style is super clunky. I've heard it said that writers should rarely use exclamation points to get across excitement in their writing, but should instead let their writing get across the emotion they're going for. I think the same thing should apply here. Instead of using this short hand to show dude is crazy, Oates should have been able to get that across through regular writing. But that's just me, as this book is lauded (it won a Bram Stoker award and everything). I just think it's shit. The other Oates book I've read was really well put together, so I don't think she's a bad writer by any stretch. It's just this experiment of a book failed for me. I couldn't get past the writing style to see if the content was worth anything, though from what I did gleam, I don't think this book would have been for me."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6639670-leah", "userReview": "Rating: 3.5 of 5Sad, disgusting, horrific: exactly what one would imagine the mind of a serial killer to be. I didn't realize beforehand that Zombie was inspired by Jeffrey Dahmer, but I figured it out after Quentin P. shared his fantasy about the creation of a living zombie. The narrative was entirely stream of consciousness from Quentin's perspective, which was super creepy, and it definitely felt like I was reading a real journal. Oates fully immersed herself in the mindset of a killer, so much so I don't know which was scarier: Quentin (and the real people he represents), or Oates' ability to connect with such a character and narrate his story.Like with a few of Oates' other books, Beasts and A Fair Maiden come to mind, there's a select group of readers who will \"enjoy\" Zombie. Most everyone who reads it will be grossed out and, at the end, left with an overall dirty, unsatisfied feeling.Serial killers fascinate me; I've done extensive research and even written a couple papers about the female variety, so I was somewhat prepared for Quentin's depravity. And, while Quentin was appalling, his very being an abomination, I can't help appreciate the story for its authentic, no-holds-barred look inside the mind of a serial killer. Yet I immediately had to pick up a fun read (Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World) in order to counteract the effects of Zombie.Disclaimer: This book contains graphic sex and violence, some of which involves minors. I would not recommend it to anyone under 18."}], "description": "Zombie is a classic novel of dark obsession from the extraordinary Joyce Carol Oates.
