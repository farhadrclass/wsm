I didn't like any of the characters and thought that Charlotte and Q had absolutely no chemistry. It was honestly cringey to read. Did you know that Charlotte was thin? No, I wouldn't have figured it out either if it wasn't pointed out 100+ times. The characters come off as really superficial, and I even found it painful to skim."}, {"userName": "Nate", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32726092-nate", "userReview": "Love Quentin & Charlette.

It is a terrific story that I really enjoyed with great characters - Quentin has still got that bit of rock star in him and he let's that free again when they meet.\u00a0 The passion between them is RED HOT and all I'm going to say is fans/air cons on now - you know what I mean!\u00a0 get ready to also fall in love with his daughter Morgan.\u00a0 There is a fabulous extra bonus from Charlotte's POV, an exclusive book plus a bonus story which I'm going to enjoy reading.\u00a0\u00a0I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.\u00a0 But as I loved this story so much I bought my own copy and look forward to reading the extras plus Kira's next book!Definitely recommended - get a copy now to read!"}, {"userName": "Cassie", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49238907-cassie", "userReview": "** spoiler alert ** Reformed manwhore and drug addict, Quentin McDonnell now takes his job as chief editor and father seriously. Charlotte has dreamed of working for Mad Music Magazine since she was little and has always had a crush on Quentin. One rule stands in there way: no fraternizing between employees! Will Quentin and Charlotte be able to resist the pull between them? Will they be able to work out a way to be together?This book was hot! I was happy that Charlotte was able to pull Quentin back a couple of times when his past behavior popped up. Quentin drove me insane with his back and forth, BUT I understood why and I was honestly happy with his dedication to her once he gave into his feelings. Didn't like Pamela at all and would have loved to see something happen to her and Maggie! Great book and cannot wait for more from this author!"}, {"userName": "Magali", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63353655-magali", "userReview": "It\u2019s a great written story, quite simple and sweet with some hot sex scenes.

Charlotte was a fan and she knows that since he\u2019s a father, he stopped all exces.

Quentin was a rock star years ago and was into the drinking, drugs and women. Now in his 30's he's the editor of a music magazine. He has a 7 year old daughter he adores. Charlotte came from small town Ohio to become a writing intern at the same magazine. The moment they met they felt a change in themselves. Unfortunately, there's a no fraternization rule. Pasts, secrets and a whirlwind surprise romance keep the attention of the reader. I received a complementary copy of this book and chose to write a review. I look forward to reading future books by Ms. Blakely."}, {"userName": "Jurae", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81146026-jurae", "userReview": "Good readI enjoyed reading this book it gave me a sense of deja v\u00fa. Charlotte is an intern at the magazine run by former rock legend Quentin. Their attraction is immediate and it seems that they are destined to be together when Charlotte finds herself living down the hall from Quentin but the non-fraternization clause in their contracts would test their limits. The characters were believable and the story line was great."}, {"userName": "Bonita", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73884987-bonita", "userReview": "PerfectionAuthor Blakey drew me in on this book from the first few pages and kept my interest until the very last page, it is that well written. I fell in love with main characters Charlotte and Quinten with their witty banter and their sexual chemistry. Quinten\u2019s daughter Morgan is such a little imp and her and sassy mouth had me laughing throughout the book.

Mean girls and doom and gloom for 25% of it. Good thing Tony was thought of. I didn't understand the contract, the ten years that went by and why Maggie would even still be hanging on. As for the mean girl intern with limited music background, why would a magazine keep her once the internship was done?"}, {"userName": "Gladys", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60886838-gladys", "userReview": "I enjoyed this steamy read. A workplace/boss romance that has a fun storyline, likable characters, and some heat filled scenes. with hot chemistry, a bit of drama, and a lot of passion, this book is a read that is entertaining and enjoyable.
