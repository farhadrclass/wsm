Firstly the setting for the Lake house is amazing and Kate Morton has a wonderful sense of time and place in her novels. Set in two time frames, 1930s Cornwall and 2003 London the plot slowly unfolds and the author introduces two mysteries that need solving. I was totally drawn in by the descriptive and vivid writing and the wonderful images that that the author created. The characters in this novel are very well developed and likable, I loved the 1930s setting, the period house, set in an enchanted forest, a dysfunctional family with secrets and a mysteries going back 70 years.I was so taken with this novel that I bought the audio as well as the Kindle edition as well and I have to admit I even took this one to work as I just could not pull myself away. The Narrator was excellent on the audio version although the story did drag a little in places.So what was there to hate about this novel, it was too descriptive and way too drawn out. But the biggest disappointment of all was the contrived and fairytale ending. It was so bad I wanted to fling my kindle across the room. It felt like the author got bored and just wanted out. There was also a few incidents in the story where you would have to seriously suspend belief. I always urge people to judge a book for yourself because we all differ on how we react to a story and I am in the minority on this one.I did find this an atmospheric read but not as good as her first couple of novels."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3332895-lori", "userReview": "I had really, really wanted to wait a little closer to the publishing date to read this, but based on all of the great feedback, and my love of her previous novels I couldn't resist. So here I sit having just finished... let me start off by saying that all expectations I had for this have been exceeded. I have enjoyed all of KM's novels but this one will easily go down as my favorite. As a writer, she has a unique gift of being able to weave past and present stories together in a way that seems effortless. In this, both stories had me captivated from the very beginning. My only criticism would be that the ending was a bit tidy for my liking, however, even this small fact does not deter me in the least from giving this a strong five star rating. Bravo, Kate!"}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "Hmm... Good, but not as good as I expected. Feeling a little underwhelmed right now. This one had been sitting on my Audible shelf for a long time. Even though it has been on the bestseller lists forever, the twenty plus hour length was daunting. Finally, I decided to tackle it.The story is told in multiple timeframes -early 1900s, 1930's and 2003- and has multiple stories woven together. The common thread is Sadie Sparrow, a London detective on leave after leaking information to the press about a case she'd been working on. Sadie goes to stay with her grandfather at his home in the country to get away from the city and clear her head.While staying with her grandfather, she stumbles upon another unsolved case from 70 years earlier. The case has some similarities to the case that she'd been working on recently and Sadie begins investigating the cold case to keep her busy. Soon, she is completely absorbed by the disappearance of a young boy from the lake house seventy years earlier.As the story progresses, multiple leads are explored and snuffed out. Glimpses of the lives of the boy's family members are provided as letters and other insights are revealed. Alice, the boy's sister, is an esteemed writer and offers many insights into the events surrounding his disappearance.Although there was a love story or two along the way, they took a backseat to the mystery surrounding the crimes. Since I am primarily a romance reader, I craved a stronger love story that was more central to the story. That never happened because it just wasn't that type of story. Therefore, I never really connected with this story.I never felt emotionally invested in the story. In over twenty hours, I never felt excited, anxious, sad or much of anything. The entire story just felt \"flat\" to me. I never cared one way or the other about the characters. If it weren't for my compulsive need to finish every book I start, I probably would have DNF'd this one. I knew it wasn't my cup of tea and it seemed to drag on forever. I was surprised with the ending, but not necessarily satisfied. I think I expected more. After all of those hours, I was left thinking \"That's it?\". Underwhelmed is probably the best descriptor of my feelings after finishing this book.Despite all of my gripes, I did think the story was well-written. If mysteries were my thing, I probably would have really enjoyed this one. However, any story without a strong, central romance isn't going to appeal much to me. So, this is probably a case of \"it's not you, it's me\"."}, {"userName": "Cathrine \u262f\ufe0f ", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine", "userReview": "I only got through a quarter of it. Just cannot get interested in the story. Jumps back and forth between multiple time periods and characters with long-winded descriptions about everything and everyone. It was like listening to someone trying to tell me a story that cannot stay on track. I liked her other books. Perhaps I'm too impatient and the timing for this one was not right. Reading can be such a subjective endeavor sometimes."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "Either I'm now so old, bitter and cynical that I can no longer enjoy harmless fluff, or this wasn't anywhere near as good as Kate Morton's others. Two things are inevitable when authors recycle the same formula: a) you'll compare every detail of each new book to its predecessors, and b) there will come a point when said formula starts to feel tired and past its best. The Lake House just doesn't have the same magically indulgent appeal as the author's previous books, though the ingredients are there: a beautiful tumbledown house in the country, a family secret hidden for decades, a character receiving a fateful letter, and a narrative that's split between 'past' (1911 and the early 1930s) and 'present' (2003). There's nothing strictly wrong with the story, I just found it dragging at points which seemed at odds with how compelling previous Morton books have been. But it's as cleverly plotted as ever, with cliffhangers galore, and I admit I wouldn't have wanted to give up without knowing how it all ended."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Two different story lines decades apart, a young boy missing in the past and a policewoman at odds with her superiors and a woman author, make up this story. As with all Morton novels, very descriptive and atmospheric, maybe too much so. Her novels seem to follow a pattern, but this is a comfort read, one know exactly what one will get. A little suspense, a family tragedy, secrets and at last a d\u00e9nouement.

So beautiful and fragrant it overwhelms your sense of sight and sound and smell. Perhaps tea will be served by the gateway, just over that knoll,\twhere you can follow the pathway down to the lake.Decades ago, in 1933, back at the house, on a midsummer night\u2019s eve, 11 month old Theo Edevane vanishes from the nursery, where his Nanny Bruen lay sleeping, just feet from his crib.The local constabulary pour over the estate, butTheo is never found and his disappearance never explained. Fast forward to London in 2003, where Alice Edevane, Theo\u2019s sister, now an acclaimed mystery writer remembers that long ago night,still harbouring suspicions of her own. Suspicions in which she herself feels culpable.We will meet her twice. Sadie Sparrow, a London detective, is on a month\u2019s forced vacation, visiting her grandfathers Cornwall home when she unintentionally stumbles upon the now, long abandoned Loeanneth and all it\u2019s attendant history. She is intrigued by the unsolved mystery.But back in the real world of Sadie\u2019s livelihood, an unsolved child abduction case looms large upon her mind. She is certain things are not as they seemThat something far more sinister is afoot.She is alone in her certainty,And eager, desperate even, to reclaim her post.One case that she cannot rid from her mind and another that she is not allowed to pursue.As promised we meet Alice again in 1932, as a bright, innocent and precocious 16 year old, with a penchant for writing mystery stories,months before that fateful mid summers eve.A time when Ben was still at Loeanneth,a time of dreams and misplaced certainties.Kate Morton serves up an atmospheric tale of family secrets and intertwining destinies, revolving around three mysteries. Told from the perspective of our vacationing detective and the Edevane family members that were present on the night that Theo vanished; their stories and memories weaving back and forth in time.What really happened to Theo? With myriad twists and turns Morton ties up all the loose ends and brings this tale to a satisfying, if somewhat too tidy conclusion, that leaves me wondering if we wont be hearing more from Sadie Sparrow.

One simply requires an aquaintance with man's dark depths, and the inclination to explore them to their very end. Besides, haven't we all experienced the desire to kill, if only for a moment? \"I loved this. This was my first novel by Kate Morton and it definitely won't be my last. On a summer evening in 1933, eleven month old Theo Edevane vanishes from his crib and is nowhere to be found. After months of searching with no results, the devastated Edevane family leaves their lakeside estate in Cornwall for London. They will never go back. Seventy years later, Detective Constable Sadie Sparrow is visiting her granddad in Cornwall on a leave from her job. On a run through the woods, she stumbles upon the once proud Edevane mansion...now an overgrown ruin. Her natural curiosity is piqued when she learns the story of the baby boy who disappeared from the house without a trace and she decides to seek answers.I wouldn't call this story fast paced by any definition, but in this case it really worked. The story goes through many different people's perspectives, through many different periods of time. But I never felt lost or confused by this and I really enjoyed all the extra detail it added. Even with all the clues revealed throughout, it really kept me guessing up until the last 60 or so pages and even then I couldn't fully predict the outcome. I loved how everything connected together in the end. Also worth mentioning, I had a friend on here mention how she was impressed with how authentic Morton made her characters sound ( they being set in London and the author being Australian ) and I couldn't agree more. I literally cried a few happy tears during that last chapter :) I hope to read more by this author very soon!"}, {"userName": "PattyMacDotComma", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma", "userReview": "4\u2605I always like Kate Morton\u2019s books, and I liked this one too. They are very long, complicated, multi-generational mysteries made up of criminal incidents and unexplained events long past that someone today has become curious about. She doesn\u2019t play favourites. Each generation and character is fleshed out and recognisable. That\u2019s what makes her books so long. And there are boatloads of red herrings. Every time I\u2019d figured it out and thought\u2014Oh, come on, get on with it already\u2014she\u2019d toss us another little one to send us on another trail. Today is 2003, and D.C. Sadie Sparrow has been sent out of London to escape the unfortunate publicity about her leaking confidential information to a journalist about a case she\u2019s frustrated with. A mother had apparently disappeared, abandoning her little girl for a week in their flat. Sadie, now unprofessionally close to the grandmother, suspects foul play and has been doggedly pursuing justice at the possible expense of her career. She goes to stay with her widowed grandfather in Cornwall, and while there, she comes upon a lake house, Loeanneth, abandoned for 70 years following a family tragedy where a much-loved baby brother disappeared in the 1930s. She can see through the windows that it\u2019s still furnished but layered with dust. Another child. Another disappearance. Stuck in Cornwall, she starts researching.Meanwhile, Morton introduces the people of Loeanneth. The baby\u2019s mother, Eleanor, had been besotted with her first son. She loved his three older sisters\n\u201c. . . but with Theo it was more than love. She \u2018cherished\u2019 him . . . she\u2019d looked into his eyes and seen there all the wisdom babies are born with before it slips away. He stared back, trying to tell her the secrets of the cosmos, his little mouth opening and closing around words he didn\u2019t yet know, or perhaps no longer remembered. It reminded her of when her father died. He\u2019d done the same thing, staring at her with bottomless eyes, filled with all the things he\u2019d never now have the chance to say.\u201d\nI\u2019ve always said newborn babies look as if they have a 45-year-old Martian inside who knows everything, and as they wake up to the world, the Martian gradually disappears. Eleanor and her husband had bought back her childhood home, Loeanneth, and her mother, Constance, was reduced to moving back in with them. She was a cold, cranky old lady who hated living \n\u201cin this godforsaken place where the smell of the sea, its horrible crashing sound when the breeze blew a certain way, was enough to make her blood run cold. Constance despised the sound. It reminded her of that terrible night all those years ago; she\u2019d thought herself rid of it when they\u2019d left the house more than twenty years before, but life could be cruel like that.\u201d\nEven the baby\u2019s grandmother has secrets! But that goes back further, and Eleanor and Alice, her middle daughter, and Sadie, the modern-day detective, are the main generations we\u2019re concerned with. Today, Alice is in her 80s and is a highly successful mystery writer, full of theories as to what might have happened to her baby brother. She was a lively, imaginative girl, and we get to know her well in her teens, when she\u2019s making up stories and trying to be grown-up. The only time I got confused was when \"old\" Alice was reminiscing about her youth, and I had to separate that material from when the author was telling us about Alice\u2019s youth as it was happening, so to speak. I consider Eleanor the main protagonist, the one who held the family and the story together. She was an active, adventuresome, curious little girl who fell madly in love and married, raised children (put up with her cranky mother), and then had to take over and manage her war-damaged husband when he returned from the horrors of WW1.There are lots of side stories, including Sadie\u2019s original abandoned child story, and they\u2019re all enjoyable. I\u2019ve always liked Morton\u2019s writing. At one point, Eleanor has taken herself to London for an appointment she\u2019d unsuccessfully tried to drag her husband to.\n\u201cIt was raining outside now and London was slate-coloured and smeary. The streets glistened with dark puddles and a tide of black umbrellas flowed above the human traffic beneath. People moved faster in the rain, their expressions set, their eyes focused, each intent on his or her goal. There was so much scurrying purpose out there that Eleanor was overcome with weariness. Here, in the warmth of the tearoom, she sat inert like a single piece of flotsam in a sea of determination that threatened to sink her. She had never been good at filling time. She ought to have brought a book with her from Cornwall. She ought to have brought her husband.\u201d\nAs for her spiteful mother, Eleanor has good reason to feel vengeful and finds her chance when the family leaves the lake house after the baby boy disappears. This is not a spoiler, just an excellent example of how Morton winds up even then the smallest storylines.\n\u201cThere was no question of the old woman moving with them to London, but she couldn\u2019t be abandoned either. Not entirely. Eleanor searched all over before she finally found Seawall. It was expensive, but worth every penny . . . \u2018It\u2019s just right,\u2019 Eleanor had said, signing the admission forms. And it was. Just and right. The unrelenting sound of the ocean for the rest of her days had been precisely what Constance deserved.\u201d\nThese books could be edited down to a more digestible 350 words or so, but then there wouldn\u2019t be room for all those red herrings, I guess. :)"}, {"userName": "Tegan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5544791-tegan", "userReview": "There's a cover and a synopsis!!

Its Kate Morton after all, and she only does supreme excellence in the writing department. She knows how to set the mood, knows her characters, and her grand homes. I know that when I sit down to read her book, I will become lost within its pages. There's nothing to do about it either. I get completely lost. Isn't that why we read? To get so lost that you forget that there's a world beyond the one in which you hold in your hands? I'm not going to give you a synopsis of The Lake House, you can read that yourself. Just know that there are a lot of secrets within, but that's also something Kate is good at: family secrets. I wouldn't say this is my favorite of hers.

I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.While Kate Morton has written several highly praised novels, I\u2019m embarrassed to admit this is the first of her books I have read. So, I had no idea what to expect when I started reading this one, but I had a feeling I was going to like it. Alice, a successful mystery writer and Sadie Sparrow, a detective visiting her grandfather while on leave, have their lives intersect in the most unlikely of ways, but it almost feels like fate is working overtime because the odd circumstances that place them together will unravel years of secrets, lies, guilt, and will ultimately lead to the truth about a seventy year old cold case. Seventy years ago, Alice\u2019s youngest sibling, Theo, disappeared, and has been presumed dead. But, his body was never found, and no one was ever charged with a crime. The lake house was abandoned just as it was, nothing moved or packed away, and has stood empty for decades, when Sadie happens upon it. Sadie is in some hot water at work and her partner is trying to keep her from being fired. So, he suggested she lay low for a while. But, what caused her to make such a huge career blunder, is a distraction from her past. With nothing to keep her mind busy, Sophie begins to delve into Theo\u2019s disappearance. What she uncovers is absolutely astounding\u2026.I love it when a mystery novel is written in a literary prose, and this story certainly has that advantage, but in the beginning the story was sort of disjointed and moved very slowly. The truth is, nothing all that exciting comes to pass until the half way mark, when all that came before begins to take shape. From that point on, the story became so absorbing, I couldn\u2019t stop reading and found myself still awake at one a.m., totally spellbound. This is such a compelling story, which goes far beyond the initial mystery that brings Alice and Sadie together. They don\u2019t write enough of these types of stories anymore, which is sad. Although there are heartbreaking elements to the tale, the ending is simply perfect. I highly recommend this story to those who love historical mysteries, contemporary fiction, and great story telling."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "The novel starts in Cornwall in 1933 with 16 year old Alice Edevane in the family country house of Loeanneth and the Midsummer Eve party that affected several lives. Then the story moves to 2003 and introduces the reader to Sadie Sparrow, who is on enforced leave from the Metropolitan police after her refusal to let go of a case involving a grandmother, mother and abandoned child. Sadie feels the mother has not abandoned her baby at all and there is more to the story. Is she right? This is just one of the stories and secrets to be unveiled in this novel. I really liked Sadie as she held strongly to her views and wasn\u2019t frightened to stick to her guns. I also loved the relationship with her grandfather Bertie who she stays with in Cornwall.In London 2003 we then meet the now elderly Alice Edavane, a mystery writer, and her assistant Peter. Once again secrets abound about what happened to her brother when he was a baby, but Alice knows more than she ever let on. Later in the book there are other time shifts back to London 1911, filling in back story, so it seems the author has a lot of threads to pull together. There are quite a few red herrings with regard to the boy\u2019s disappearance that could lead the reader off the track, before the final revelation. Initially it took me a little while to settle down to being pulled from one time and place to the other but once I got to know the characters better I was absorbed and went with the flow because you know sooner or later you are going to see how they all connect.My favourite Kate Morton novel so far was The Secret Keeper. But this is right up there with that one. The only reason I didn\u2019t read this more quickly was life and other commitments kept frustratingly getting in the way. Every chance I got I was back with Sadie and Alice and co. It\u2019s a big book but it never feels that way. I recommend this for anyone who loves stories about secrets and families.

One day while running with her grandfather\u2019s two dogs, she wanders into a neglected garden near Bertie\u2019s cottage. Through the garden she discovers an abandoned house. With furniture and belongings still intact, it looks as though the occupants had just left one day and never returned. Sadie has a bad feeling about the house and her cop\u2019s instinct kicks in. Although she is supposed to be taking a break, she initiates an investigation into what happened at Loeanneth, the lake house.Her investigations lead her to become acquainted with the renowned mystery novelist, A.C. Edevane (Alice), and her assistant Peter. Together they are determined to solve the mystery of what happened at Loeanneth so many years ago\u2026A story about family secrets, lapses of judgement, guilt, homes lost and found, great loves, great passions, and an enchanting place in the world, \u201cThe Lake House\u201d is a prime example of what fiction should be. Escapism with endearing and engaging characters, myriad twists and red herrings, an idyllic setting, romance and mystery, and a satisfying resolution.This novel will hold great appeal for bibliophiles. The author\u2019s love and respect for books, reading, and libraries is evident throughout her eloquent prose. I read her novel \u201cThe Forgotten Garden\u201d a few years ago and it remains one of my favorites.Highly recommended! One of my favorites of 2015!"}, {"userName": "Tabetha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42488126-tabetha", "userReview": "\"She'd realized recently (an awareness that coincided with her new obsession for Agatha Christie) that what her previous story attempts were missing was a puzzle, a complex, knotty twist of events designed to mislead and bewilder readers. Also, a crime. The key to the perfect novel, Alice had decided, was to revolve the story around a crime's solution, all the while tricking the reader by making it seem she was doing one thing when in fact she was merrily doing another...'I've had a brilliant idea,' she said...'A kidnapping, Ben. I'm going to write a book about a kidnapping...'\"\nThis is an atmospheric mystery surrounding a now abandoned lakeside estate in Cornwall, UK, and involves the tragic disappearance of 11 month old Theo Edevane, so long ago, that became a cold case and that forever affected the Edevane family. The novel jumps back and forth through time, and provides the points of view and back story of many different members of the Edevane family. Alice, Theo's sister, was 16 when he vanished and continues to blame herself, still searches for answers. She is now a successful mystery writer, and when a young female detective finds the abandoned ruins of the estate, and begins to dredge up old skeletons, so to speak, Alice is forced to think of the past, and to remember...The writing is so vivid that I pictured this as a beautiful BBC Masterpiece Classic/Mystery adaptation, a combined period piece and contemporary miniseries. Every night was a gift, when I was finally able to open this book, and was able to step back in time to the 1930's, or to the more recent past of 2003; this intricately layered mystery kept me analyzing and guessing the many clues provided until the very end, when all is ultimately revealed. The story has so many great elements, including love, romance, loyalty, post traumatic stress (shell-shock), loyalty, the power of denial, the mistakes of our youth, and more. Although not always fast paced, this was more of a slow burn, uncovering and peeling back clues and layers. I felt the numerous details helped create a deep connection with the characters, creating more empathy for their actions. A last parting quote from Alice:\n\"It wasn't so much the discovery of a single clue, as the coming together of many small details. That moment when the sun shifts by a degree and a spider's web, previously concealed, begins to shine like fine-spun silver...\"\n Kate Morton, I am a fan!"}, {"userName": "Book of Secrets", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3453249-book-of-secrets", "userReview": "THE LAKE HOUSE is a lovely story told in alternating time periods, and at its heart, the mystery of a boy who went missing in the 1930s. While on leave from her job, a police detective stumbles upon an abandoned estate in Cornwall, and discovers the 70-year old cold case of Theo Edevane's disappearance from the house. The story shifts between the present and past, back to 1933 and Theo's sister Alice's account of what happened leading up to his disappearance. I enjoyed the book - very descriptive, with well-drawn characters, and a Gothic undertone. The story had some nice twists, though the ending did seem a bit too coincidental. Still, a good book.

I can think of Tara in \"Gone With The Wind\" and \"Manderley in \"Rebecca.\" Kate Morton writes great books where the houses are characters and this one is no different. Loeanneth, The Lake House, is so important to this story. It was once a small house on a larger estate but it's certainly not small by current definition. It's a magic place with a private lake and great grounds for picnics and exploring.  In 1933 a couple lived there with their three daughters Deborah, Alice and Clemmie and their 11 month old son, Theo. They live an idyllic life that shoes are only put on to go to town. These are children adored by their parents, Eleanor and Anthony. Their grandmother, Constance, and family friend, Mr. Llewellyn, also lived with them along with all the sundry employees needed to keep the estate running smoothly.  Life is great until a large midsummer party takes place. Theo disappears and no one ever discovered him. The family closes the door on The Lake House and leaves everything just as it is. They move to London and the girls grow up. Alice becomes a famous author, think Agatha Christie, and Deborah becomes the wife of a famous politician. Eleanor makes a visit once a year to the house but after she dies and leaves the house to Alice, no one comes near it. Seventy years later, Sadie Sparrow is put on disciplinary leave from the London police department. She visits her grandfather in his new house in Cornwall and stumbles across Loeanneth and learns the story of the missing boy and the cold, cold case. Needing something to occupy herself, she starts to investigate. The book has so many layers and so many secrets that it's like an onion. The layers keep being peeled away and everything you thought you knew is gone in a poof of smoke. Things keep being revealed and you can barely put the book down because you just have to know what's going to happen next. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. This is one of my favorite books of 2015 and I just couldn't recommend it more highly.

I would have loved to live on the estate as well as to be a part of the investigating.THE LAKE HOUSE goes back and forth in time and is filled with mystery, hidden passageways, intrigue, family secrets, and all of Ms. Morton's wonderful, creative writing skills, marvelous story lines, and descriptions that get better each time you turn the page and that put you right at the scene or definitely wanting to be there with the characters. \u200bMs. Morton knows how to keep her readers interested and not want the book to end.\u200b Twists and turns seem to be Ms. Morton's trademark along with marvelous, surprise endings.

Alice, second daughter of the wealthy Eleanor and Anthony Edevane lived on the beautiful country estate of Loeanneth in Cornwall, revelling in an idyllic life where she was free to explore the woods and the lake. Alice had recently decided she was going to be a writer and had decided to present her first manuscript to her friend, Ben Munro, a handsome young gardener who encouraged her to write and with who she decided she had fallen in love. However, events don't quite work out as she planned and something happens that night to blow apart the family and their lives, causing them to flee Loeanneth and never return.Some seven decades later, a young police detective, Sadie Sparrow on enforced leave from her job, discovers the neglected estate while staying with her grandfather and hears how the Edevane's baby son, Theo disappeared on that Midsummer Night in 1933 and was never found. Intrigued by this very cold case, Sadie scours the local library for information and tracks down Alice, now a well renowned writer in London, to try to solve the mystery.The Lake House is a long book, mainly because Kate Morton really likes to flesh out her characters as well as her story. Alice's mother, Eleanor is one of the main characters and her life is laid out in detail, from her childhood at Loeanneth to her marriage, the birth of her children, her struggles to come to terms and cope with her husband Anthony's return from WWI and his PTSD. Each member of the family has secrets and these are gradually bought to light, each adding to the complexity and fabric of the story. Sadie's story is also interesting and her secrets are also revealed from her childhood and close connection with her grandfather to the reason she is licking her wounds in Cornwall. If you enjoy family sagas set over several decades you will enjoy this but if you are looking for a fast paced mystery then you may find this is too finely detailed for you. For me it was almost a five star read except that the final revelation was just a little too neat and contrived. 4.5 \u2605"}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie", "userReview": "Not my favorite Morton...review on the way! Stay tuned. I will start by saying I love Kate Morton's writing. She has the ability to paint a setting and a time in history like very few writers. She is also wonderful at her character development. I can picture the story and each character as the book unfolds. But...this was not my favorite. I felt like she crammed a bit too much into one story. There were mysteries, and a family full of secrets which eventually are revealed and a heroine who is coming to terms with her own life and all her shortcomings. I just felt as if there were too many things going on, too many coincidences and it all tied up way to neatly for me at the end. She usually does an excellent job of moving between the past and the present. I did not think that she was a successful in this book. There were too many narrators for me. Each character had their own theories and there were so many different paths to follow that as a reader I kept guessing, then hitting a dead end, then second guessing until I really was at a point of \"enough already!\". Get me to the conclusion! By no means will this keep me from being a Morton fan. Nor would I hesitate to recommend The Lake House as an entertaining read. Just a bit too long and drawn out for me."}, {"userName": "Allison", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9371994-allison", "userReview": "So when is she writing another one?Kate Morton is one of those authors whose settings are so vivid, they make you nostalgic for a similar time or place even when you've never been there. She also draws fully dimensional characters, and along with that comes sadness and failing, and reality of life. Normally I don't enjoy books that drag me into acknowledging harsh realities, but Morton is one author who does it in such a way that I can't help admiring it. This is another wonderfully written book, a joy to read even with the pain that is uncovered along the way.The atmosphere in The Lake House is warm and nostalgic on the one hand, and full of overgrowth and decay on the other. As the story switches back and forth from the 1930s to modern day, you get such a sense of innocence and paradise lost, and can't help but fear knowing how the tragedy happened. The mystery is explored in the modern timeline, with character perspectives from the past interspersed. The past timelines bring the tragedy alive so that it's not just a distant memory being uncovered. The discoveries kept me involved, but I guessed some of the big twists before the characters did. Probably because I had extra information from seeing the past firsthand. But there were a couple of surprises in there for me still. I'm still not sure what I think about the final surprise. It was almost one coincidence too many. That's just a minor point, however, and the pieces do fit.I also didn't hate the book once I knew everything, which can happen when the ending is too disturbing or senselessly tragic (I'm looking at you, The House at Riverton!). Thankfully, I was satisfied with this conclusion. Every tiny clue and action was accounted for. My only complaint is that I didn't get more of the characters. I wanted to follow them further, away from the Lake House.

The Lake House is no exception, and it was perfect to curl up with for a few afternoons and lose myself in. There are a few different mysteries working in tandem here, but the main thread of the plot is the 1933 disappearance of 11-month-old Theo Edevane, who is taken from the Edevane family estate (charmingly named Loeanneth and located in Cornwall) and mourned by his family: his mother and father, the deeply in love Eleanor and Anthony, and his three sisters: Deborah, the pretty, composed eldest; Alice, the headstrong, creative middle child, and eccentric tomboy Clementine. The story flips back and forth between immediately prior and following the kidnapping, backtracks into Eleanor's childhood and her and Anthony's early love story, and forward into 1993, where we meet a present day set of characters, primarily Sadie Sparrow, a police officer on leave who discovers the now-rundown Loeanneth and starts to dig into its mysteries while trying to forget a particularly upsetting case she recently worked on, and the elderly version of Alice, now a very famous crime author.This sounds a little confusing, but the complex structure is well-handled by Morton, who is by now very used to setting up mysteries with multiple threads, and I loved the intricacy of it all. Nothing Morton writes about is extraneous - every detail fits somewhere in the puzzle of the The Lake House. Morton is also excellent at evoking certain times and places, and I was completely enchanted by the thought of the lush but tumbledown Loeanneth (in fact, because of her I've now made visiting Cornwall a priority on my trip to the UK next year!)The story falters a little at the end, as I found some of the midway twists more surprising and effective and the ones at the very end were a bit convenient and rushed, but it doesn't really take away from the overall effect of the book.

She learns of the missing boy and decides to find out what happened to him.\u00a0I think the heart of the stories, the theme that every story in this book has in common is the bond between a mother and a child. From Alice grandmother, Constance's story to Sadie's story can you see how the loss of a child can affect the life of the mother. There is just so much heartache and a woman like\u00a0Constance can seem so hard and unloving because you don't know her story and then you learn what happened to her and you realize why she is the way she is. And Eleanor story, her seemingly happy idyllic marriage is if you scratch the surface not that happy at all. And, I could go on forever about the different relationship, but I don't want to spoil the book. Let's say that behind every woman in this book is a story that is waiting to be told.I loved reading this book, learning along the way what had really happened when Alice was young and what happened to Theo and I enjoyed finding out more about Sadie and why she was on forced leave. This book has a really rich story with well-written characters and I especially like reading about Alice mother Eleanor life because that really explained so much and gave me a whole new picture of her than the one I got at the beginning of the book when Alice is \"telling\" her story.The only drawback in this book, for me, was the convenient ending. It was just a bit too perfect and frankly I would have liked the ending, well, perhaps not more tragic, but less convenient at least.
