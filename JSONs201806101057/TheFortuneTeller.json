It spans over thousands of years covering several lifetimes and takes place across multiple countries crossing borders and oceans. Gwendolyn Womack has masterfully woven a compelling tale of mystery and secrets interlaced around major historical events through time and place, ranging from 46 BC Alexandria, Egypt to the present day New York.Semele Cavnow works for a prestigious New York auction house as an antique appraiser. While preparing for an upcoming auction from a client's personal collection in Switzerland, she discovers a rare and ancient manuscript. Digging further, she realizes that this extraordinary manuscript which is part memoir and part prophecy is unknown to the world. Its author Ionna, is a two thousand year old, powerful seer who has in great detail and precision narrated events in her future that we've known and read as our world's history. While Semele is trying to unearth the mystery behind this mystic manuscript, someone is keeping an eye on her. Her hotel room gets almost burglarized and there is a man following her everywhere. Things start getting tense when these priceless manuscripts get stolen from her high security company office in New York and she is abruptly taken off the case. What is the secret hidden within this ancient manuscript? Why is someone so desperate to possess them? How does this all connect to Semele's life? How can a two thousand year old seer acknowledges Semele by name in her writings? Are these mere coincidences or is there a deep hidden mystery beneath it all?The Fortune Teller is a gripping and an absolutely fascinating tale. I was completely lost in Semele's and Ionna's story. The back and forth of the dual point of view works brilliantly for the story. At one end Semele is trying to figure out the mysteries within the mysterious manuscript and on the other end Ionna narrates her story and the future she sees through the years within the manuscript. There is a slight paranormal touch to the story, but I felt it was seamlessly blended with the plot. Alongside there is plenty of classical reference, historical events and also a wisp of romance.This was unputdownable. I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful story of secrets, mysteries and family ties that span over centuries and would highly recommend it if you enjoy thought provoking mysteries with historical references."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15493045-lisa", "userReview": "The Fortune TellerGwendolyn WomackMY RATING \t\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fPUBLISHER\tBlackstone AudioPUBLISHED\tJune 8, 2017NARRATED\tLisa Flanagan, Robin MilesA fascinating mystery involving libraries, ancient manuscripts and an woman who can see both the past and the future.SUMMARYSemele Cavnow appraises artifacts for an prestigious New York auction house. In Switzerland, at the home of a recently deceased manuscript collector she discovers an ancient manuscript written in the time of Cleopatra. The manuscript\u2019s author, the daughter of a librarian, tells the story of her decendents forward in time along with a priceless deck of tarot cards. As Semele translates the manuscript she realizes it is so much more than she originally thought. She discovers she is personally connected to both the manuscript and the cards. Her name is in the manuscript. How can that be? Once she is back in the United States, Semele feels that she is being followed, and may be in danger, but she is determined to figure out the mystery of her connection. When bad things start happening around her, she knows there may be only one person that can help. Theo Bossard is her client, his family owned the manuscript and he should know what it means. Will he help her? Can she trust him?\u201cWhatever the cards show you, always trust the words that well inside you. The truth is waiting to be heard. Never doubt it.\u201dREVIEWThe Fortune Teller is a fascinating travel through history from the time of the Library of Alexandria to the conclusion of World War II. The story creatively alternates back and forth through time, from what Semele is reading in the manuscript to the mystery she is experiencing in the present. Semele\u2019s character is a bluestocking strong women, who doesn\u2019t back down from a fight. Gwendolyn Womack has created another irresistible story to follow her gripping debut novel The Memory Painter (2015). Her writing is engaging and captivating.

How about with what a great book The Fortune Teller is. I really enjoy historical fiction, especially when it is done in a dual storyline format where the past and present storylines work cohesively with each other to tell the entire story. And that is exactly what Womack has done here. I thought this book had a very unique plot and the way it is written, it is so compelling that you just don\u2019t want to put the darn book down. I would describe it as part thriller, part supernatural mystery. The entire time I was reading it, I kept thinking about how much it reminded me of The Da Vinci Code (which I loved). The conspiracy theory, translations of historical artifacts, the significance and hidden meaning in the antiquities, the race against time to solve a puzzle and how the past, present and future are entangled to bring you to the final outcome.Both storylines were equally captivating, in my opinion. I was just as engrossed in the manuscript translation as I was of Semele\u2019s modern day story. I never found myself wishing one would end so I could get back to the other, which sometimes happens in dual storyline books. If my schedule would have permitted, I would have finished this book in one sitting, it was that good.I would highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1496564-robin", "userReview": "Well, I just wrote a terrific review for this compelling book that took me out of my reading slump but my computer froze and I lost it.

I'd made an exception for this one, managed to clear my rating, and then decided to revert to 1 star--which is easier to find--because so many people have Liked this non-review. ANYway:)Ordinarily, I don't read as though I've been hired to make improvements in the text. I don't know why I was in that mode almost from the beginning here, but I kept noticing improbabilities of plot and detail:* The manuscript conservator hired to \"four times a year ... inspect the works for any damage and readjust the temperature settings\" for the collection, rather than the late owner maintaining the temperature as well as the humidity.* The \"letters written by St. Augustine in A.D. 412\"--a literally incredible find if original, and with an inexplicably specific date if not--\"and a pristine collection of Greek manuscripts ... from about A.D. 350.\" No MS from the 4th c. seen in the 21st can reasonably be called \"pristine\".* Our modern protagonist Googling the owner's fascinating heir only after several days working at the chateau.* Her investigating a cabinet \"that had been catching her eye all week\" only in the last hours of her last day on the project.* Her washing her hands to touch the discovered book without also donning cotton gloves. [Later: I find from a recent James Runcie that this may not be as incredible as I thought. Apologies.]* The unconvincing handwaving for the ancient protagonist's improbable freedom in the Library of Alexandria.* The embroidery of that Library's well known copying of every book arriving in port into having it retain rather than return the originals and piling up warehouses full of uncopied texts, a practice its visitors would not have long tolerated.* And on p. 27, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, an accurate definition of paleography which is then impossibly used to date a MS to a 5-year range, 50-45 B.C.

The multiple stories spanning some 2000 years make it hard to follow the main plot and eat up the space of the supposedly major characters, so you never get to properly know them, and when one of them died, I couldn't care less. It was just a name to me. And that's bad because clearly that death was supposed to elicit a strong emotional reaction.The historical parts are half-baked. Famous historical figures like Cleopatra, Caesar, Ghiberti, Rasputin pop up pointlessly along to way, just so they can be there. They're not a part of the fabric of the story, they're celebrity cameos. There's a lot of telling and scarce showing. The cards are constantly mentioned as being powerful, then Semele or her ancestors touch them, they feel their power, etc., but they never actually do anything. At any point. All the Seeing is done through concentration or in dreams. The cards are basically useless.The writing felt amateurish to me, like an ambitious high schooler trying to get into the big writing game. The plot twists lacked power because, as I mentioned, there's not enough time to get to know and therefore care about the characters."}, {"userName": "MaryAnne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3203398-maryanne", "userReview": "I think this is my favorite kind of book where the past, present and future collide in the stories of amazing women. \u2764"}, {"userName": "Julie Timmer", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17490688-julie-timmer", "userReview": "I loooooved this book!

The book throws Semele into intrigue revealing the mysteries of the past and mixing them with present day machinations.I loved this book! I requested it on a whim having never read this author before but liking the sounds of the blurb. Womack does a fantastic job of throwing you back into the past through different individuals who takes us all over the world at different points in time and weave us a story that carries straight through to present day. We take this journey with Semele as she slowly translate the documents and comes to the realisation that this book was written directly to her. Which, should be impossible as it\u2019s over 3000 years old. I was hooked.This book was a little slow to start with, but the more I read, the more intrigued I was, I wanted to know how everything was connected. Who was writing to Semele? Why were they writing to her? I was especially enthralled with the parts of the book set in the past, the translation from the diary, it showed familiar places at different times and it lent an exotic appeal to the whole book. There was also a dash of romance in The Fortune Teller although, it wasn\u2019t really the main focus. It was all about Semele discovering who she was, and the plot that seems to be emerging around her.This is my first book from Womack, but it definitely won\u2019t be my last and I recommend you pick this up if you want an interesting mystery with elements of romance and magic.

This one added in the element of prophecy and the ability to see the future. The plot centers around an ancient manuscript written by a young, female seer in Egypt in the time of Cleopatra and Caesar. In the present day, translating and valuating the manuscript falls to antiquities appraiser Semele. The more she reads the more she realizes that the seer predicted major world events thousands of years after her death and that Semele herself has a connection to the prophecy. Cue the conspiracy theory and the danger as mysterious shadowy figures try to get their hands on the manuscript and deck of tarot cards that go along with it. It's an exciting game of cat and mouse that travels through several interesting locales and gets pretty darn stressful near the end! I honestly don't know which part of the book I enjoyed more, the modern story or the historic one told through the manuscript translation. Both were equally compelling and I never wanted one to end so I could get back to the other story line. The story has an incredible scope from the Library in Alexandria through to Stalin and into the present day, always following the female descendants of the original seer who was the author of the mysterious manuscript. It incorporates a ton of actual history without every feeling too bogged down with it. I personally love history so I was quite fascinated and I even learned of a few events that I didn't know about, like Caesar possibly being responsible for the burning of the great Library at Alexandria! I also was unaware of the city of Gundeshapur which was a huge intellectual center at it's height. All of this history is woven into the story of generations of strong, brave women, and a few weak and silly ones, and their psychic talents. Their stories are at times inspiring, infuriating and heartbreaking but they all lead to the modern day story and the final showdown/conclusion which was a bit over the top but still satisfying. I really enjoyed my time with this book and I highly recommend it!I received this book for free through a Goodreads Firstreads giveaway but this has not influenced my review in any way."}, {"userName": "Lauralee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22943028-lauralee", "userReview": "Actually, 2.5 stars Semele is an appraiser of manuscripts at an auction house. One day, while helping her client, Theo, with an auction, she discovers an ancient manuscript that appears to be written during the time of Cleopatra. Semele is excited about her latest find. However, when she reads the manuscript, she notices how unusual it is.The manuscript chronicles the events two thousand years after Cleopatra and seems to be writing this directly to Semele. As Semele ponders over this manuscript, she learns that she may be in great danger because there is another who is also after the fortune teller\u2019s manuscript. Semele was a hard character for me to like. She did not have a backbone in her body. She never really took control of the situation. Her actions were very cowardly. She ran away from every problem that is facing her. She pushed her adopted mother aside and avoided her boyfriend because she was afraid to tell him quits. I thought that seeing her boyfriend\u2019s future was a weak excuse to break up with him. She should have been honest that she didn't like him but Theo. Semele was also judgmental, selfish, and jealous. Thus, Semele was a frustrating character, and I didn't think she deserved a happy ending because she was mean to others. I didn\u2019t like any of the characters. Ionna was interesting, but she was not given any depth. It never really explained how she could see beyond the future. I also didn\u2019t buy her telling what will happen in the future two thousand years before her time. While she may see beyond the future, there were so many events that happened in between that for a person living in Cleopatra\u2019s time could barely fathom it much less comprehend it. Therefore, I could not buy that Ionna was narrating the events that happened in the future. It would have been more believable if Ionna\u2019s descendants added to the manuscript to explain the events. Theo was an average cliched love interest, who didn\u2019t serve any other purpose to the story except to be the one that Semle falls for. Overall, this book has romance, mystery, and action. However with all these elements, it was a bit underwhelming. The plot itself of the tarot cards was also never explained. It just pops up halfway and never really states how they were created or why they were important. The ending felt anti-climactic and the villain seemed very cartoonish rather than complex. The Fortune Teller has the makings of a great story. However, it never felt complete. Instead, it was very rushed. The ideas were never really explored. While the story is very fast-paced, it never fully gripped me. There needed to be complex characters, more explanation about origin of the tarot cards and how Ionna got her gifts as a fortune teller, and a more developed romance. This was really a disappointment for me. I loved Mrs. Womack\u2019s debut of The Memory Painter, and I was excited to see the next novel she had in store for us. However, The Fortune Teller did not meet my expectations. I will recommend this book for fans of The Lost Sisterhood, Lady of Hay, and Mariana. However, for those who wants to see Mrs. Womack\u2019s true talent, I suggest skipping this and read The Memory Painter instead."}, {"userName": "Debra Slonek", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2850117-debra-slonek", "userReview": "Excellent storytelling!

(p. 106)There is a sense of ambition to The Fortune Teller that begins with the synopsis, which invokes a kinship with the writing of Dan Brown and M. J. Rose in the way that young men in 18th-century Europe sought to form connections with influential figures, drawing on a respected and admirable lineage. The novel promises its reader suspense, romance, and secrecy, with a possible glimmer of genre intersectionality, all of which I found incredibly appealing and which drew me to it. If the above metaphor is to be carried through, however, then The Fortune Teller is a bit like a physical book version of the hot-headed d\u2019Artagnan: all words and little physical evidence to support those statements.The backbone of the novel is its protagonist Semele Cavnow, who quickly becomes underwhelming and problematic within the first few chapters. Apart from having an interesting name that does not instantly scream WASP, Semele\u2019s character does not give the reader anything new to work with, as the novel quickly dives into the familiar trope of a young and successful woman with a dream job that earns her a lot of money. She is presented by Womack as having acarefully crafted persona, the expert manuscript appraiser, only thirty-two, remarkably young for her achievements. She dressed in high-fashion vintage, wore only mascara and lipstick, and sported a sleek Ziegfeld bob that looked straight from the twenties. (p. 6).One of the novel\u2019s strengths is the way it immediately brings the reader\u2019s attention to the contemporary events that are the focus of the novel, creating a rush of movement and excitement that builds on the initial anticipation generated by the jacket blurb. Sadly, this immediacy is created to the detriment of character development and backstory, especially Semele\u2019s, who remains a shadow floating around in the present with a practically non-existent personality, save her obsession with her career. The past, which could have potentially complemented Semele\u2019s character and made it bloom into something bigger and better, instead remains dormant, artificially tacked on to the contemporary plotline.This was the main issue in the novel: the divide between past and present that made it seem like two separate novels are awkwardly crammed into one spine. Ionna\u2019s storyline was a more engaging read than Semele\u2019s and was the only character in the novel who felt complete and real despite living centuries ago, constructed from historical facts and supplemented by the imagination. The Fortune Teller makes history the victim of the same kind of privileged tone that characterized the present plotline. Specifically, Womack\u2019s clear evidence of research at times took on a feeling of extraneousness, serving no other purpose than to act as padding for the story and to show off a little. There are not many such passages, but those few that are there stick out to a reader who is familiar with history and is likely to see the patchwork quality of the prose, like in this case:Every artist in Italy was buying the book to understand dimensional mastery, \u201cthe Dei Aspect\u201d as they called it. The Book of Optics demonstrated how to create two-dimensional pictorial representations of three-dimensional space. (p. 171).There were rare moments of self-recognition and attempts at self-redemption, as if the writing itself jolted awake and wanted to correct its mistakes by presenting the reader with a rare instance of social critique, like Mathai\u2019s horrorWhen [he] saw Elisa\u2019s manuscript shoved between five others on one of the reading tables [\u2026] astonished. What had been a prized possession for them was merely another token in Admentos\u2019 library. (p. 131).It was at these moments that my hope would rise. It was moments like Semele\u2019s recollection of her trip to Amsterdam and the meaning of the cards left with the swaddled babies that felt like the real essence of what the novel could have been but was not. Instead, it was caught up in impressing the reader with the familiar, and rather melodramatic, story that leans toward overreaction and carefully placed descriptions of luxury and comfort. Even the use of the tarot card names for the chapter titles felt flimsy.The Fortune Teller is a novel that is not entirely sure what it wanted to be, mixing romance with suspense with historical fiction, even veering off in a failed attempt at mystery in the end which does not work due to the limited cast of characters and Semele\u2019s loud bias, making it easy to guess the culprit. Predictable and familiar in all the places where it could have been emotional and impactful, it delivers a selective and dramatized version of history that feels scripted. The past and present are segregated in a way they should not be, the former used to support the latter in a way that differs from the organic tone in the novels of Dan Brown and M. J. Rose, the level toward which the novel subconsciously continues to aim. It is a novel that can be described in the words of Semele herself:She enjoyed a good gothic novel as much as the next person, but that was not her real life.

We take this journey with Semele as she slowly translate the documents and comes to the realisation that this book was written directly\u00a0to\u00a0her. Which, should be impossible as it's over 3000 years old. I was hooked.This book was a little slow to start with, but the more I read, the more intrigued I was, I wanted to know how everything was connected. Who was writing to Semele? Why were they writing to her? I was especially enthralled with the parts of the book set in the past, the translation from the diary, it showed familiar places at different times and it lent an exotic appeal to the whole book. There was also a dash of romance in\u00a0The Fortune Teller\u00a0although, it wasn't really the main focus. It was all about Semele discovering who she was, and the plot that seems to be emerging around her.This is my first book from Womack, but it definitely won't be my last and I recommend you pick this up if you want an interesting mystery with elements of romance and magic. It won't disappoint.*ARC provided by publisherReviewed by Suzanne\u2764 \u2661 Don't want to miss any of our posts?

I love history so that was a fun aspect. However the history was too much of the book. I thought it took away from the main story/plot. I also spotted many holes in the story that maybe the author could see the reasons for certain things but forgot to share them with the reader. I liked the adventure of the end of the book but it wasn\u2019t long enough for me. Also the love story was severely lacking. Why were Semele and Theo meant to be? I didn\u2019t see anything that tied them in that way. A little passion but too short lived to be a big romance. Also Semele is kind of an idiot. Why on earth would she just hand over the tarot cards to Cabe..go with him to test them. She kept doing things that I thought were not smart. Why didn\u2019t Theo and his dad just show her the book and let her read it? Why the pretend auction? Waste of time and money. I could go on but at the same time I ignored a lot of the problems in the story and that way I enjoyed it more. It was a fun and easy read."}, {"userName": "Sarah Forester", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10437412-sarah-forester", "userReview": "If you mixed Book of the People with Discovery of Witches, you would get this book. It weaves between gorgeous well researched historical fiction and bland heteronormative tropes. I had to double check that it was actually a woman writer because of the ridiculous descriptions of female appearance. The supernatural element was surprisingly well balanced in that it didn\u2019t try too hard to explain but wasn\u2019t so vague that it was relying too heavily on pre-established mythology. Overall a pretty good pace but some off putting details left me ranting to friends."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9126167-kate", "userReview": "Sort of a fiction of the origins of the tarot deck--a story of the past, present and future along a series of women.

It goes back to 48 B.C., moving through time of Cleopatra, the mystics of Eastern Europe/Russia with this book taking place in modern day New York City.
