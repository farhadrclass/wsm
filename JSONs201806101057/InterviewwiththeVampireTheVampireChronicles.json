One of my casual resolutions this year was to catch up on some of the books I've been meaning to read for a while, but just never got around to. I'm so glad I finally picked up this book. I saw the movie first but still had goosebumps at the end.   \u201cIt was as if when I looked into his eyes I was standing alone on the edge of the world...on a windswept ocean beach. There was nothing but the soft roar of the waves.\u201d   What I loved most about the book The bromance of Lestat and Louis. \n\n\n\nI know this is going to sound a little juvenile, but I ship them.Their relationship is so messed up and so complex.

This is how I felt \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \u201cIt was as if the empty nights were made for thinking of him.

I could not empathize with the lead character at all - once he turned into a vampire I would be regularly bombarded with paragraphs describing how goddamn beautiful everything was now that he could see them with his vampire eyes. The forest was beautiful, the night sky was beautiful, the homeless people were beautiful...not normally, mind you, only when seen through vampire eyes.These special vampire eyes might be the reason why Louis (narrator) and Lestat (sort of bad guy) spend most of their time making moon eyes at one another. In fact, that's mostly all I can remember from the story since the plot was so forgettable. Aside from the characters adopting a girl (which was entertaining), Louis spends most of his time admiring things or arguing with Lestat.

Really, I do like vampires. Even though I'm not a \"Twilight\" fan. I even have my own set of teeth. A real goth girl inhabits my body and she hungers for dark adventures. I'm a sinister person, I know. :)First, I really like Anne Rice's prose. It is so beautiful and enchanting. The whole story comes along with a good measure of dark sensuality, which I particularly like. What is more important to me, though, is that it presents, in a very captivating way, problems which have been haunting humanity since for ever. How many people in reality live tortured by guilt and loneliness and feel different than everybody else the way Louis does? Or how many people are tormented by the thought that their looks do not show their true self and that the others are unable to see past the surface? (Claudia). Or how many people are forced to live and suffer with someone they can never quite connect to, out of necessity, loneliness, because they love them despite all, or all three at once? I think many people can relate to the heroes (I should say anti-heroes, really) of this dark tale.What is loneliness? What is the world? What is eternity? What does it mean to be immortal? What is the nature of existence? Is there God? What does it mean to be good? What does it mean to be evil? And which is the bigger evil - to be the actual committer of a crime or to allow it? What is life, what is death? It speaks not only of, and the value of, life and death of humans as individuals, but of the life and death of beliefs, values, possibilities.It is told through the POV of one narrator, but it has a really big scope. Anne Rice shows an amazing skill in reflecting people's feelings and struggles. What is fiction if not a mirror to reality? Two opposite concepts which are not that opposite, after all. Every creation of art is a message born out of its creator's experience and inner world.Read count: 4"}, {"userName": "Antonio", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21081005-antonio", "userReview": "He caminado por las calles de Nueva Orleans como el Segador Maldito y me he alimentado de vida humana para mantener mi propia existencia. No soy un mortal, padre; soy inmortal y condenado, como los \u00e1ngeles puestos en el infierno por Dios. Soy un vampiro. \nHac\u00eda tiempo que no le\u00eda sobre vampiros, y quer\u00eda darle una oportunidad a los famosos vampiros de Rice, conocidos por algunos (como yo) por la ic\u00f3nica pel\u00edcula de \u201cEntrevista con el vampiro\u201d que lleva el mismo nombre del primer libro de la saga. A diferencia de otros libros de vampiros que he le\u00eddo, ac\u00e1, la historia est\u00e1 totalmente centrada en los inmortales, se nos presentan tres vampiros que van a formar una especie de familia moderna conviviendo gran parte de la historia, cada vampiro tiene una personalidad muy marcada, tenemos a Louis el protagonista, \u00e9l es quien nos narrara su vida, su muerte y su inmortalidad.Louis representa la melancol\u00eda, la tristeza y autocondenaci\u00f3n, \u00e9l se odia a si mismo por ser vampiro, desprecia el tener que matar para sobrevivir, y tiene una b\u00fasqueda personal de lo sobrenatural y lo \u00e9tico, \u00bfexiste Dios? \u00bfExiste Sat\u00e1n? \u00bfExiste el bien? \u00bfExiste el mal? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 soy inmortal? \u00bfExiste la salvaci\u00f3n o todos estamos condenados? Son preguntas que lo atormentaran toda su existencia \n\u00bfQu\u00e9 significa morir cuando puedes vivir hasta el fin del mundo? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 es \"el fin del mundo\" salvo una frase?; porque \u00bfqui\u00e9n sabe siquiera lo que es el mundo? Yo ya he vivido dos siglos, he visto las ilusiones de uno hechas trizas por otro, he sido eternamente joven y eternamente viejo, carente de ilusiones, viviendo de momento a momento de una manera que me hizo imaginar un reloj de plata repiqueteando en el vac\u00edo; con la superficie pintada, las manecillas delicadamente talladas sin que nadie las mirara, iluminado por una luz que no era luz, como la luz con la que Dios cre\u00f3 al mundo antes de que creara la luz. Latiendo, latiendo, latiendo, con la precisi\u00f3n del reloj, en una habitaci\u00f3n tan vasta como el universo.\nEn contraparte tenemos a Lestat, opuesto totalmente en personalidad a Louis aparentemente, para \u00e9l la muerte es un placer, la disfruta, es su pasi\u00f3n, no se cuestiona demasiado, su \u00e9tica es m\u00e1s simple, \n\u2014El mal es un punto de vista \u2014me susurr\u00f3 ahora\u2014. Somos inmortales. Y lo que tenemos ante nosotros son las fiestas suntuosas que la conciencia no puede apreciar y que los seres humanos no pueden conocer sin arrepentirse. Dios asesina y nosotros tambi\u00e9n; indiscriminadamente. El arrasa a ricos y pobres y nosotros hacemos lo mismo; porque ninguna criatura es igual a nosotros, ninguna tan parecida a \u00c9l como nosotros, \u00e1ngeles oscuros no confiados a los l\u00edmites hediondos del infierno sino paseando por Su tierra y todos Sus reinos.\nY luego tenemos a Claudia, la artima\u00f1a de Lestat, que se rob\u00f3 de todas las mujeres taimadas de la historia \u00bfqu\u00e9 hacer para conservar un hombre en tu vida? Respuesta: dale un hijo, en este caso una hija, una hija inmortal, eternamente ni\u00f1a, preciosa pero terrible, para ella la muerte no hay que razonarla o cuestionarla, es solo el simple acto de alimentarse, as\u00ed como la Mona Lisa, sin risa ni llanto, debo decir que de los vampiros de la historia ella me parece la m\u00e1s temible. \nsi crees que Dios cre\u00f3 a Sat\u00e1n, debes percatarte de que todo el poder de Sat\u00e1n proviene de Dios, y que Sat\u00e1n es simplemente una criatura de Dios, por lo que nosotros tambi\u00e9n somos criaturas de Dios. En realidad, no existen las criaturas de Sat\u00e1n. \nEn general el libro me ha encantado, la pluma de Rice es envidiable para cualquier autor, debate temas profundos, como los ya mencionados el bien y el mal, lo sobrenatural, la existencia de Dios, (las conversaciones de Armand y Louis son las m\u00e1s importantes sobre esto), y el amor, si el amor, siendo ac\u00e1 bastante particular, el amor para los vampiros va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de lo f\u00edsico, si bien es cierto que se habla mucho de la belleza, para ellos tiene que ver m\u00e1s con el apego y la convivencia, con la personalidad y con los sentimientos que otros vampiros (a veces humanos) despiertan en ellos, se ven amores de padres, amores fraternos, amores de parejas, amores de camarader\u00eda, amores de maestro y aprendiz, el amor es libre, sin importar g\u00e9nero o edad, lo que me lleva a decir que si no tienes una mente abierta quiz\u00e1s este no sea un libro para ti.Desde luego pienso seguir leyendo sobre estos vampiros filos\u00f3ficos, e invito a todos a leer a Rice, si les gustan las obras de horror que son m\u00e1s que solo monstruos , as\u00ed como Frankenstein de Mary Shelley o El retrato de Dorian Gray de Oscar Wilde, de seguro les gustara la Entrevista con el vampiro de Anne Rice \nLa gente que deja de creer en Dios, o en la bondad, sigue creyendo en el demonio. No s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9. No; s\u00e9 muy bien por qu\u00e9. El mal siempre es posible.

For years this book haunted me. The rest of the Vampires books were pulpy fun but this book really had something. She captured something here and her almost baroque prose really carries the story. Later in life, I came to realize that Interview is a kind of Catcher In The Rye for goths. Louis is turned into a vampire and continues his search for the answers: who he is, why he is, what his place is. He wars with lovers, family and friends in his search to define his own life only to discover that nothing he does matters and that everyone is just as lost as he is, an ultimately there are no answers but the ones we make ourselves."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "Damn you straight to hell, 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, for what you made me do. You made me read a goddamn vampire book. Not only that, you made me read a vampire book with a cover made entirely of shiny ostentatious material that shouted to everyone in the library as I checked this out, \"Look everyone! Madeline is reading a book about vampires! SHINY SHINY SHINY LOOK AT ME! I CONTAIN SEXY BROODING VAMPIRES AND I AM SO EFFING SHINY.\" (I cannot stress how shiny-gold this cover is. Like, the ancient Egyptians would look at this cover and say, \"That's a bit much.\" It was awful.)Okay, so the book itself isn't bad, really - hence my rating of two stars, which Goodreads classifies as \"it was ok.\" That's what the book is: just okay. Maybe I would have been more thrilled by the story if I hadn't seen the movie - even though there's stuff in the book that didn't make it into the movie, none of it is particularly thrilling. At least the movie made the wise decision to keep the blatant, in-your-face-but-unacknowledged homoeroticism (seriously, this book is, and I mean this in the most literal way possible, the gayest thing I've ever read) but changed the fact that a) Claudia is only five years old in the book and b) she and Louis do everything except actually have sex with each other. They're always kissing and caressing each other and Louis is calling her his lover and his paramour and it is so fucking creepy.But, lest we forget, vampire books are supposed to be creepy. In these post-Twilight days, it's easy to forget that there was once a time where vampires fucked and killed and were a general amoral all-around good time, and if one of them chose to be all broody and sad about being a vampire he was the weird one that no one else wanted to hang out with. God, I miss those days - to the point where I considered giving this an extra star, just because I was so grateful to read a story about vampires who do actual vampire stuff and it's sexy and scary instead of boring and schmoopy. Also good was how in-depth Rice goes into the psychology of vampires, and I loved her explanation for why they haven't overrun the planet: most vampires are miserable, and end up killing themselves. Explains Armand, who I will continue to picture as Antonio Banderas and you can't stop me:\"How many vampires do you think have the stamina for immortality? They have the most dismal notions of immortality to begin with. For in becoming immortal they want all the forms of their life to be fixed as they are and incorruptible...When, in fact, all things change except the vampire himself; everything except the vampire is subject to constant corruption and distortion. Soon, with an inflexible mind, and often even with the most flexible mind, this immortality becomes a penitential sentence in a madhouse of figures and forms that are hopelessly unintelligible and without value. One evening a vampire rises and realizes what he has feared perhaps for decades, that he simply wants no more of life at any cost.\"That part was pretty cool. But as for the rest, I'll just watch the movie, thanks. Or not, because if we're going to be honest I don't even like the movie that much. It's probably time to admit to myself that I have no interest in reading about/watching any vampires not created by Joss Whedon. Sorry, Ms. Rice, but if my vampires must be broody, I at least want them to be funny and charming too.

Such a bad press over the years what with all the blood sucking, neck snapping and general ravaging of virgins, maidens and anyone with a taste for Gothic-style bedroom furniture and an open window. Still, now that Edward Cullen and his pan-faced fan base of moody teens have infiltrated popular culture, replacing the stereotypical images of pale, foppish young men in lacy cuffs and brocaded velvet jackets with a utilitarian Gap-Style wardrobe of urban wear (and a slightly sulky look), we seem to be moving further away from the more traditional imagery. That said, R-Patz (see I know the lingo, I listen to the kids) appears to be dead from the eyeballs down in many scenes and is probably as wooden as the stake which should be used to pin him back into his eternal resting place, so not all elements of the vampire legend have been entirely done away with.Interview with the Vampire was almost solely responsible (see Lost Boys for its partner in crime) for spawning the epidemic known as the great vampire obsession of the late 20th century or at the very least a huge resurgence in the interest in vampire myth and lore. Ok, ok Bram Stoker deserves a big old nod for originally bringing us the whole idea of wing-ed blood suckers who like nothing more than a snooze in a wooden box and a brisk sea journey to the north-east coast of England. Or if you like we can go a bit further back and point the sharp end of the stake at Sheridan Le Fanu for his sapphic vampires which featured in his collection of short stories \"In a Glass Darkly\". Whoever you'd like to blame for it, you have to admit they were onto a good wheeze. The romance of immortality fuelled by the go-juice of another human being (it goes down easier if you just think of it as a sort of clotted Slim-Fast meal) seems to have had a weirdly kinky appeal which has garnered it a fan base of millions. Lets break it down and see what there really is to like about being a vampire.Eternal life - obviously gets a big tick but then it does depend who you get stuck with. If you end like Louis, locked in a bitter battle of wills with the sadistic Lestat, then eternity is going to seem like, well.... an eternity.Drinking blood - readily available, free (therefore credit crunch chic), nutritious and virtually calorie free. It's simple: Live fast, die young, drink blood and have a good looking and upwardly mobile corpse. (WARNING: don't try this at home- this review is not suggesting that a diet of blood will ever do you any favours, nor is it condoning \"borrowing\" the blood of people who are not you). Alternatively, forever is a long time to go without a solid meal and you know you'll eventually start complaining that dinner always tastes the same.Flight/ surprisingly speedy turns of movement - being super fast is a handy skill to have if you need to face the pacey modern lifestyle of the 21st century. Queue jumping, being first in the door at the Harvey Nichols January Sales and avoiding having to sit in economy class during flights are all things which would improve my life.Sleeping in a coffin - compact and bijoux if you live in a tiny inner city apartment where you're kitchen, bathroom, living room and bedroom are all practically the same room. Why not drape your coffin with an attractive throw and turn it into a table for night-time use? On the downside no one ever said eternal rest would be a comfortable one.Interview with the Vampire takes itself pretty seriously (a lot more seriously than this review), and despite the fact Louis' hand wringing and tortured immortal soul act did start to grate on me towards the end, overall I enjoyed this and was able to stop raising my eye brows long enough to appreciate the detail and originality of the story.

MY. GOSH. So, you've been whining about your life as a vampire for how many hundreds of years now, Louis? We get it. You weren't given much of a choice and Lestat wasn't a good \"daddy\". Please get over it already, you undead baby! \ud83d\ude31 To be fair, I must state that my expectations for Interview with the Vampire were probably too high, hence, my slight disappointment. Now that that's out of the way......my biggest issue with the book was the format, i.e., the \"interview\". Perhaps it's an unfair criticism, but I almost felt like it was cheating somehow, and it is this style of story presentation that allowed Louis to drone on and on and on and on.He literally told the interviewer that he needed to start at the beginning. And so he did. However, Louis was allowed to tell his story with virtually NO interruptions or questions from the interviewer. I'm talking HOURS here. That's just unrealistic in an interview situation. So, during that time, the book would lapse into the common first-person POV, totally making you forget that this was an interview. And Louis gave way more personal insight (imho) than you would give in an interview, if that makes sense...And then there's Lestat... Having only seen the movie, I didn't remember Lestat being portrayed as awful as Louis made him out to be; therefore, I was disappointed in his seemingly total lack of character. But I've been assured by TL that The Vampire Lestat will change my mind, so I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series. After all, Anne Rice is a great writer and I love vampires.Overall, looking past the interview format (which may bother only me) and Louis' whining (which should bother everyone), the book was really good. The yearning for understanding, acceptance and relationship is important to everyone, even vampires, and Louis' story is one worth reading."}, {"userName": "Gaijinmama", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/917504-gaijinmama", "userReview": "I am going to confess that I didn't read this book until 1993, after I'd seen the movie. I couldn't handle horror movies or scary books at the time, but Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and a surprisingly good Tom Cruise really got my attention. Now I'm a bona fide fan. I'm working toward reading everything Rice has written, and now I enjoy many other authors who write about vampires. It wasn't just that the vampire dudes were soooo totally hot in the movie. As is usually the case, the book turned out to be even better. Rice's characters are among the most compelling ever created in fiction. Louis with his constant moral conflicts and philosophical musings, Lestat with his naughty Bad Boy Bloodsucking Attitude and sarcasm (which Tom Cruise did really well in the film..though Lestat is definitely supposed to be taller!). Claudia with her keen intelligence and relentless anger at having been trapped for eternity in a child's body. Armand for being..at this stage of the series anyway...such a deep, dark, sexy enigma. Rice was the first author to make her vampires complex enough to keep my attention and, more importantly, make me actually **LIKE** them as they go around ripping people's throats out. My favorite character however, has got to be the City of New Orleans, the true star of this show. I'm sure I'm nowhere near the first reader who has been inspired by Rice's books to visit this special, unique city and wander through the French Quarter and the Garden District. Rice knows and loves her city, and that feeling is infectious. I'm a sucker for well-developed characters, but in this book and the rest of Rice's work, it's the setting that draws me in most of all.

Had I read Interview with the Vampire back when it first came out, or in some close approximation thereafter, I would probably have truly enjoyed it. As it stands I have been exposed to far too many broody, I-am-a-monster-look-at-me-punish-myself vampires to feel much of anything for Louis. This breed of vampire is overdone for me, entirely. And to be fair, they never held much interest for me in the first place. You can keep your Stefan Salvatores, your Angels, your Louises\u2026 I want the monsters with no conscience. The monsters who destroy everything with a fangid smile on their blood-drenched face. The poisoned parody of human version of vampires, that\u2019s the ticket to this ghoul\u2019s heart. And I know there is an argument for Lestat, or Claudia, filling that void (and they did, in a distant way) but I didn\u2019t get enough of them to feel satisfied. This story is told from the perspective of Louis, and while it strives to pull away and make history feel like present day it never succeeded at actually pulling me from that dimly lit kitchen into the history he was sharing. I would argue that the movie does a better job of this because it forces you out of the kitchen, with its visual nature. Now none of this is me saying I didn\u2019t like Interview with the Vampire, I just didn\u2019t love it. Not like I love the movie in any case. For me, Claudia was the most interesting character. She was horrifying and monstrous, the way child vampires tend to be in any story. A child vampire is simply more terrifying than any adult vampire can ever be. They are immortally trapped in an age of innocence, while her mind could grow and learn and become exceedingly adult her body would never be able to catch up. She is cursed with a life of appearing \u201ccute\u201d no matter how monstrous and dark her soul and nature becomes. Horrifying shit, that. There is also a selfishness to children which is amplified by bloodlust, which never seems to fully disappear. I enjoyed the way this was portrayed, as I said, but I was too disconnected from her to get my fill of this child-shaped horrorshow.

Thought the film was very good. Not sure whether it was as good as the book or not. It is very similar to The Picture Of Dorian Grey. In both books the main character had a wealth of knowledge and experience. They rub shoulders with the more, privileged people.Is vampirism real? I once watched a documentary video; fake news? And in the film a lab scientist had a series of clear tanks containing mice. Some pregnant mice, some new born mice and another containing an old mouse. The hairs on its chin were grey so I guess he was getting old. I think mice only live for about two years so this one was probably at least two summers old. Anyhow I digress, this gets nasty now. The video goes into a time lapse. The lab assistant was taking baby mice from the mother and feeding them to the old mouse. The video is filmed over a couple of weeks and condensed to a few minutes on the time lapse. Now, the old mouse is getting younger! Wtf! The old mouse, eating the pure clean flesh of new born mice, gets younger. His greying chin hair is now a lovely golden brown and he is flitting about his environment like a teenager. I don't know whether this video is real or fake. Was the mouse swapped with a younger one? Who knows? If it is fake it is quite...elaborate. So I ask again, is vampirism real?If it is real then the Race of the Vampire would be far older than humanity. That means they would Predate humanity. So explains why Vampires predate, as in hunt, feed off, suck the blood of humans. So does Predate mean what is says, before? Or, hunt, stalk, eat? Or are the two meanings the same? Was the Tiger here before the deer? Was the wolf here before the sheep? As humans, with our intellect, we as a race don't really have a predator these days. We create things to protect us. So are we the top of the food chain? Do we, as in all nature, have a predator? For every right there is a left and every up there is a down. Are we the most intelligent beings on this planet? Are there many races? Do they hide in the shadows? What is folklore compared to mainstream? Why is Romania called Rome Mania? Legend of Dracuul. Vlad the Impaler. A madman! Was ancient Romania, Visigoths? Gothic? Named so because it became a Roman outpost? Rome occupied Egypt. Romany, curses and casting spells. The mystics of Egypt did too. I am forever playing Devils Advocate, too many questions and not enough answers. Let's take the Alfa Romeo car manufacturer. I recently learned it is owned by the Vatican. Maybe. Who knows? We all know that the Vatican is a state within a state. Like the city of London, where all the oligarchy live. Or the District Of Colombia. So, the Vatican probably owns the Alfa Romeo car company, secretly it would appear. The esoteric world communicate via logos. Sigils, symbols, icons etc. A picture spells a thousand words...only to those who can decipher them. Words are only for the masses. They are swords.Now let's look at the Alfa Romeo badge. I am not going to copy and paste one in for fear of copy right strike. One will have to look for themselves however, I can describe it. Here goes:A circle within a circle. The outer circle, enveloping around, spells the words Alfa Romeo. To the left of the inner circle is the Red Cross of St. George. To the right is a dragon. On the dragon's head is a Crown. A forked tongue protruding from the dragons mouth. How absurd.Let's break this down. A circle within a circle. A wheel within a wheel. Hidden. Esoteric. Occultic.The outer circle contains the word \"Alfa\" top, supreme, dominance. Also the word Rome. It envelopes the inner circle. So Rome is top dog.To left of the inner circle is the St. George Flag. A red cross. England. Did St. George not slay the dragon?To the right of the flag is a Dragon.On top of its head is a Crown. Royalty. What appears to be a forked tongue protruding from its maw. If one turns the logo 180 degrees one can clearly see it is not a tongue at all...it is a human! So the Dragon has a Crown on its head and a human hanging out of its mouth. How absurd. It's only a company logo right?So according to this badge. Rome is top dog and there would be no Royalty if not for Holy Roman Empire. The Royals are actually dragons. Lol! And they eat humans, really? David Icke must be cringing. Lol! It is so absurd, it is crazy. What is true is that some time ago Prince Charles visited Romania and whilst walking around some Gothic temples with the Romanian leader he turned and said. With a chuckle, \"You do realise ofcourse that I am a direct descendant of Vlad The Impaler\". Or words to that effect. I remember watching it on a mainstream news channel. Is Prince Charles the Prince Of Wales? I think he is. Does the Welsh flag have a Red Dragon on it? I believe it does. Is Prince Charles a direct descendant of Vlad The Impaler? He thinks he is. Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Interesting to know that Windsor is not the real name of the British Royals. Romania. Rome. Egypt. Britain. Celtic. Druids. Mysticism. The Vatican. Royal Bloodlines. The elites believe it.Incidentally the Visigoths had a distinctive red shield and a Criss Sword. I read some where that the name Rothschild means Red Shield.Coincidence? I hope I am not hung drawn and quartered. :-)I used to watch Penny Dreadful on TV and really thought it was a great show. Penny Dreadfuls were small comic book magazines from the Victorian era. Basically like fantasy and folklore. In the TV show the main plot was vampirism. In the show the protagonists find an Alpha Vampire, an original. The creature has an autopsy. The skin is scaly and covered in hieroglyphs. Egyptian hieroglyphs. Its fangs are akin to a serpent. Hmm! I thought it was a very interesting concept. Dorian Grey also featured heavily in the show, as did Spring-Heeled Jack. The show was subsequently scrapped. I wonder why? I wonder a lot. When an alpha bites it infects. A made vampire in folklore is actually infected, not born a vampire, so when it rises from the dead it could almost be considered a Zombie. It is rumoured that archeologists have unearthed many plague pits across Europe and UK and in those mass graves the corpses were beheaded and had punctures to the chest area. I once read an article about this very subject. The piece outlined that indeed during the middle ages and before this was quite frequently practiced. Was it merely superstition? I certainty never learned this at school, it was not in the curriculum. I will research this subject more.\ud83d\udc2f\ud83d\udc4d"}, {"userName": "Heidi The Hippie Reader", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-hippie-reader", "userReview": "[Also created by Lestat, Claudia doesn't waste much time putting up with his nonsense.

I read it again just before Neil Jordan's film version came out, and then I let it slip into the recesses of my personal mythology, only letting the memory of it pop out once in a while for some wistful nostalgia and a vow to read it again. This year's glut of filmed Vampire adaptations -- HBO's True Blood, based on Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse books, and Stephanie Meyer's Twilight -- got me longing for a good Vampire fix again, something well written, something weighty, something inventive, something that was targeted for an audience with literary tastes rather than your regular purveyor of pop culture.The hunt was on.My mind slipped straight through its familiar fondness for Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and dismissed her work as the wrong place to go to find my fix. After all, can you get more pop-culture than the Vampire Chronicles when you're talking about Vampires (besides the aforementioned)?So I found myself going to the source of all great Vampire work -- Bram Stoker. I started peeking at Dracula late in the night when the rest of my day was done and the kids were in bed, or after True Blood was finished on the movie channel. Dracula was as excellent as I remembered, but it didn't come close to satisfying my craving. Earlier this week, though, I found myself looking at my shelves and there, again, was Interview With the Vampire. This time, without a thought, without any hesitation, I picked it up and dove in. I'd forgotten how good Interview With the Vampire is. It is not just a piece of pop culture fluff (although it certainly became a pop culture event after its publication). It is a surprisingly well written masterpiece of depth and feeling. Anne Rice may have written some poor stories before and since Interview With the Vampire, but those stories don\u2019t change the fact that she is a damn good writer (unlike Harris or Meyers who, despite their popularity and entertainment value, are mere hacks in comparison to Rice). Her prose is clear, clean and evocative of emotions and sensations, breathing undeniable life into the story of her undead hero, Louis.She writes so beautifully about Louis that it is almost impossible not to find oneself believing his story is true. I want there to be a majestically handsome Creole vampire who consciously struggles with the cost of his immortality because of his human beliefs. I want there to be a tormented vampire whose visions of love transcend human morals and concerns, who can love a nihilistic child vampire, a seemingly sadistic master vampire and a brooding but gorgeous male vampire differently but with equal intensity.And I want there to be a vampire so wrapped up in his own journey of undead discovery that the concerns of human history float past him like a stick sliding unnoticed under a bridge.Louis feels the world, his world, so richly, loves humans so deeply, thirsts for human creation so intensely that he -- in his interview -- can convey nothing other than his lust for life and all that is living. And that is Rice\u2019s gift to us: the declaration that living life intensely, whatever that life may consist of, is the most important thing we can do.I think I might have received that message from her twenty years ago, and I\u2019ve been trying to live it ever since. I hope I am alive in twenty more years to revisit Louis and test my living against his call to feel. I wonder how I will have done by then."}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "I really regret seeing the movie version of this prior to reading it because it spoiled the ending of the book. Anne Rice has Louis tell his entire life story to some idiot journalist that reflects the reader's supposed ignorance to the world of the vampire. This device worked to an extent, but I just knew how it was going to end so a lot of the magic was wasted on me. I sincerely regret watching the movie because it hindered my enjoyment of the novel. That being said though, the ending was as bad as the movie\u2019s.  An absorbing, yet disappointing, story The novel is the kind you storm through to reach the end. I still felt the pull even though I knew the outcome. The journalist quizzes Louis on certain aspects of his story, which were supposed reflections of what the reader was thinking. It\u2019s like the author new the questions that would be born and intercepted them before they could be asked. But, some of them were far too na\u00efve and far to0 predictable. Overall though, it creates a show rather than tell fell; there is no narrator giving us awkward amounts of knowledge on the complexities of vampirism. Instead there is Louis telling us his life story in a conversational, and confiding, manner to an idiot journalist who barely understands it as signified by the ending. I wanted to slap the guy with the predictable response he gave at the end. Moreover, the life Louis has lived is complicated by his duality of nature. Inside him there is a war going on between his vampire body and his human soul. He is a vampire that loathes killing and wishes that he could teach his creator, Lestat, to be more like himself. He looks back on his life in a retrospective tone and understands the decisions he made with more wisdom and experience. He can see his creator for the bloodthirsty killer he is, but more importantly he can also see him for what he isn\u2019t. This was a good dynamic but, again, the ending let me down. A manipulative creator, and a weak protagonistLestat fears losing Louis, for all his coldness he still feels one human emotion: loneliness. He will bind Louis to him anyway he can, with whoever he can. So, together the pair ends up making a vampire out of a little girl. There is no denying Louis interesting life, but the man lacks any form of a backbone. He is so easily led first by Lestat and then by a little girl. He just doesn\u2019t stand up for himself in anyway. I think he is a very weak vampire, not because of his human soul but because of his lack of courage. He should have left Lestat very early on or stayed with him forever. Claudia was braver than Louis could ever be. \u201cI lived like a man who wanted to die but who had no courage to do it himself.\u201dDespite knowing the ending in advance, and still being excited to reach it, the final payoff was as disappointing as the movie version. I was hoping the book ending would be stronger. I think the author spent too much time trying to work up room for a sequel than closing this book in a memorable way. The ending was just rather poor, and made me decide not to pick up another book in this series. I enjoyed this book to an extent, but I know I wouldn\u2019t enjoy the next. I think this is one of those very, very, rare cases when the movie is actually better than the book.A weak 2 stars"}, {"userName": "Morgannah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6241201-morgannah", "userReview": "When Interview with the Vampire came out in 1976, it flat out flopped in hardcover, selling only 25,000 copies. The subsequent paperback release did marginally better, but the book\u2019s reputation grew steadily over time, and eventually a cult following developed, especially among the goth subculture, the LGBT community and female readers.Before I say anything else about Interview, I have to say how unusually dark it is and I have read some really dark books in my time. This is the story about Louis\u2019 struggle with coping with the fact that he is an immortal and destined to live forever. \nThe author's writing style is well suited to conveying such a tale as it is hurried and confused right from the very beginning. As the novel progresses it becomes simply passionate in its language, coinciding with Louis\u2019 appreciation of his new-found perception of life, which is integrated with periods of frustration. The actual events of the novel are horrific in nature. In the hands of someone like Stephen King this would be an all out horror novel, reveling in the gore and traumatic happenings of the story. Mrs. Rice, however, shows a great deal of restraint with her blood drenched narrative, describing events in a calm and serene manner.She also does some interesting work with the vampire canon. The fact that she focuses on the everlasting lifespan of the vampire is part of the novels\u2019 allure and gives it a very distinctive dark and moody ambience. \nMy friends here at GR have told me the series goes downhill from here so I am not overly eager to continue with the next book."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "It's hard to admit that a movie with Tom Cruise in it could actually be less boring than a book.But there you go.I read this when I was a teen, and I had a much higher tolerance for meandering bullshit plots than I do now, so my review was originally 3 stars.

Can a book be disappointing if I expected not to like it? Or, rather, can I be disappointed in it? Yep. This was seriously boring. And repetitive. And boringly repetitive. And unexciting and also it rehashed the same things over and over. And over. Did I mention it was boring? Because it was. Even more than I expected. At about 100 pages in, I was like \"OK, this isn't terrible, that's good.\" And then... It just stayed right there. At \"Not Terrible\" level. Nothing interesting happened, nothing exciting, nothing to make me want to find out what happens. I finished this simply because I was knitting stuff and running errands, and I might as well listen to something while I did that, but mostly I just zoned out, especially towards the end. Impressive endorsement, eh?So, OK, here's the book, Cliffs Notes version: There is a vampire giving an interview to a mortal \"boy\", telling his life story. (By the way, aside from the novelty of finding out that there ARE actually vampires, I have no idea why this boy sat all night listening to this vampire. He seemed interested... but by what?) Anyway, so, this vampire tells his life (or undead) story: A vampire met him, coveted his property, turned him, moved in, manipulated him and was a general, all around jerkface. Our narrator vamp, Louis, whines a lot. Gets all existential-y a lot. Whines some more about existential stuff. Questions everything: Where do I come from? What is my purpose? Why do we need to kill to feed? Who made vampires? God? Satan? Bob the Builder? Are there more of us? Why is killing PEOPLE so much awesomer than killing animals? Why is killing some people (read: pretty ones) awesomer still than killing some other (read: not pretty ones) people? Why do I ask so many questions? OK, I threw that last one in there. He should have asked it, though. I mean holy crap on a stick, he's got The Life\u2122: he's rich, and smart about investing so will likely remain that way, handsome, and immortal, which all amounts to him being able to do whatever the hell he wants to for as long as he wants to. Yet all he does is WHINE and ponder the meaning of life... or undeath. Because, you know, humans have it all figured out. /snark.Anyway, plot summary continued: Lestat continues being a jerk, and adds a 3rd to their happy family, a child. Who will remain a child forever and ever and ever... except in her mind. (Oh the bitterness and anger and existentialism and questions... They never end!!) The two turnees don't like Lestat (because he's a jerkface, remember?) and so they plot their method of getting him out of the way and going on their merry way to find their own answers. They travel around and find zombie vampires, ask some more questions about them... travel more, and then they find more vampires! Wooo! Finally, something like progress! Only... these vampires are also boring fucking paper wastes. They are all existential-y too, only their subject of choice is technically death rather than existence. So, again, a rehash of What It All Means\u2122... You get the point by now, right? I mean MY point, because I still don't think the book has one. Frank Muller reading the audio helped me to get through this. Anne Rice has diarrhea of the pen when it comes to detail, and her pen only writes in one color: Purple.Her purple pen has put me off of quite a few of her other books, and would have put me off this one too, had I not been able to find something shiny and zone out for a good 20 minutes at a time while she described a door, or moon reflection on the water, or the texture of the smell of velvet or some such. Shiny thing, you saved my sanity. Thank you. Anyway... I don't know why I continue to attempt Anne Rice. I think it's because so many people love her books, and there are so many of them, that I rationalize that the next one will probably be better. Except... no. It's not. Or maybe it's just ME, and I just don't like her. Six of one, half a dozen of the other. I think this will be my last attempt though. At some point, one just has to admit defeat and move on. I've finished two of Rice's books, ever, out of a combined 7 or 8 or so attempts, if I remember correctly, and I didn't like either of them.

I think he was my first book boyfriend.This is my first re-read since the 90s, I think, and it didn't hold up as well as I'd hoped. Louis is a dreadful vampire. He has as much self-loathing as Bill Compton from the Sookie Stackhouse series. Sheesh. I found it dreadful to read from his POV. He hated being a vampire and was so melodramatic. I like to read about unapologetic vampires who thrive and are confident and kick-ass. This is NOT that kind of story.It does read like a \"new\" classic with lots of literary phrases and descriptions. It's well-written as a historical novel about an earlier Louisiana and France in the 1800s. It has a certain appeal. But I think that Louis is insufferable as a leading man. Claudia shines with what she is given. Lestat is sort of a villainous caricature here (readers know he is fleshed out in future books and becomes much more complex than any of the vampires in this series, for better or worse).

that kills us.\u201dLouis approaches a young reporter and begins to tell the boy his tale - how he became a vampire, back in the 18th century by the hands of Lestat, his growing love for Claudia, a vampire woman stuck in a 5 year old body, and his desire to learn more about the beast he had become.This is one of those modern classic vampire tales, one that I've been meaning to read ever since I got interested in vampires back with \"Twilight\". But after reading the Anita Blake series and finding that I really didn't care for most of them, I was honestly afraid with this book. I tried to read a paperback version - and I just couldn't get into it. I tried to listen to an audiobook version - but I had an abridged copy. So I made one final effort to get into this series. And boy, I'm glad I made that one final effort! This book was freaking amazing! I adored it!I really liked the time and effort Rice put into her characters. Louis, Lestat, Claudia, Armand, even minor ones like Babette and Madeleine were well-developed. My favorites were Lestat and Claudia. Lestat was completely manic, the vampire who absolutely adores what he does and doesn't spend a moment considering the consequences. I just really liked how cavalier he was; he made jokes with corpses that were just disturbing - and yet I found myself laughing! (May I just add that Tom Cruise, not necessarily my favorite actor of all time, did a supreme job at playing Lestat in the movie?) And Claudia! I had seen the movie, in which Kirsten Dunst does a great job portraying a 100 year old vampire stuck in a child's body, so I kinda knew what to expect, but the book expands on that, really gives it depth. You feel sorrow, knowing that this grown woman will never have the body that she is on the inside. That she will always be seen as a child, a little girl. The complicated relationship she and Louis have - part lover (don't worry, there is no sex, but there is eroticism), part father-daughter, part creator-creation - just accents this conundrum.I'll be honest; Louis, our main character, really got to be annoying and whiny. But you know, I've always said that I don't have to like a main character to get behind him and be interested in his story, and Louis is definitely that sort of character for me. Sure, I think he's a whiner and a loser and under-motivated, but I was always interested in his story and eager to hear more.The story itself is more of a biography than your typical \"beginning-middle-end\". There is Louis' desire to understand what he is, his love for Claudia, his guilt for killing so many to feed his body, but mostly, the story is just watching him through time. His interactions with Lestat. His love for Claudia. His journey to Europe to discover what he is. Exploring Transylvania and finally meeting others of his kind in Armand.The writing kinda stumped me when I tried to read the paperback, but the audiobook made it easy to breeze past the rough introduction. It's a bit hard to read a book that's basically one character telling another character a story, but honestly, I've encountered worse. Rice does a good job; the audiobook made it easier for me to imagine that Louis was telling me this story - and I think that is what REALLY helped me \"get\" this book.There is no doubt I will be checking out \"The Vampire Lestat\". I absolutely have to get more of Lestat and find out more about this creative world. I can see why this is considered \"must read\" for lovers of vampire fiction."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Oh God, I'm going to have to do this.

Especially since my last confession which was ....... approximately 23 years and several months ago. Er. Hmm. I accuse myself of the following sins.\"\"Go on my son.\"Oh, he speaks! Okay, where was I.\"In the last 23 years I have read 64 true crime books, you know, those sleazy penny dreadfuls about serial killers and all of that, and I have read umpteen books about pop music, but I have not read any Tolstoy, Toni Morrison or Balzac, no Stendahl, no Kafka\u2026 no Thomas Pynchon.. are you getting the drift here?\"Good Christ, thinks the priest, it's one of those. I wouldn't have thought it to look at the fellow. But he's one all right.\"No Toni Morrison, are you sure my son?\"\"None at all, father. I even read Interview with the Vampire, but I didn't read Beloved or the Song of Solomon or any of that stuff.\"\"Yet you know the titles.\"\"Oh yes, I know the titles, father. That's all I know. Just the titles.\"\"Go on then.\"\"Well\u2026 also\u2026 I think Michael Haneke movies are dull and repetitive, Herzog is dreadful and I'd rather throw myself off a cliff than sit through anything by Eisenstein, Godard or Fellini. And I realise throwing yourself off a cliff is another sin.\"\"Well you're right about that. You'd better come clean about the rest of it too, I suppose.\"\"Right. Yes. Well.\"Silence.\"This is quite difficult, father. Okay. I never listened to Radiohead.\"The priest is visibly shocked.\"You never listened to Radiohead? The world's greatest band whose OK Computer is poised to wrest the title of all time best rock album from the dead hands of the shibboleths of the sixties for ever?\"\"Yes Father, that Radiohead.\"\"You never even heard them? At all?\"\"No Father. For these and all my other sins that I cannot now remember, I am truly sorry, firmly resolve not to sin again and humbly ask pardon of God, and of you, Father, counsel, penance and absolution\".\"Well, I've heard some things, as you do, when you're a priest, I can tell you. But this\u2026. Well, at the very least, you must read three Toni Morrisons, go and buy AND listen to OK Computer AND Kid A, and buy AND view the boxed set of Werner Herzog which is on Amazon for a reasonable price. And don't leave it another 23 years again.\"\"O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended you, and I detest all my sins, because of Your just punishments, I firmly resolve, with the help of Your grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasion of sin.\"\"Out you go then, skedaddle.\"Whew, that was awful. But it had to be done. Fancy mentioning Interview with the Vampire. I could have said something else, like Jack Kerouac, that's bad enough. Oh the shame. Well, he's probably heard worse. Oh well. Hmm, Radiohead can't be that bad, can they?"}], "description": "This is the story of Louis, as told in his own words, of his journey through mortal and immortal life. Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even \"settle down\" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires - a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.", "title": "Interview with the Vampire\n      \n          (The Vampire Chronicles #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43763.Interview_with_the_Vampire__The_Vampire_Chronicles___1_", "average": 3.98, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1380631642l/43763.jpg", "reviews": 8507, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7577.Anne_Rice", "name": "Anne Rice"}], "type": ["Horror", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Paranormal", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43763.Interview_with_the_Vampire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6428035-interview-with-the-vampire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/978945.Interview_with_the_Vampire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7481242-entrevista-con-el-vampiro", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2924362-interview-with-the-vampire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6096675-interview-with-the-vampire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9646229-interview-with-the-vampire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43812.Entrevista_con_el_vampiro", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/924680.Interview_with_the_Vampire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43814.The_Vampire_Lestat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43758.The_Queen_of_the_Damned", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11901.The_Witching_Hour", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31336.The_Tale_of_the_Body_Thief", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31338.Memnoch_the_Devil"]}
