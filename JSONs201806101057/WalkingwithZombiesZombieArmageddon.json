This was set on an estate near to break spear and the zombies have spread.It was mostly set in a club but we met a lot of people outside as well. Talbot was great, a zombie who can think was a great addition. The book was fun to read, the writing was excellent, and I loved all the crazy people as well. There wasn't a military presence in this but it didn't matter, the book was awesome anyway. I'm going to get book three as I want to know what happens next. Will Dominic get his man, and what about the other survivors?

Staff and patrons try to maintain \"business as usual\" but there is no way to ignore the moans of the undead for long!Ian Woodhead's \"Walking With Zombies\" continues the saga of the Northern Council Estate, a small urban district in Britain. While the first novel, \"The Unwashed Dead\" covered more territory of the estate, this one is written so a majority of the plot is contained in a restaurant/bar called The Stolkholm Club. The time span is short as well, one evening. These factors contribute to a very tight knit group of characters where the volatile action ignites like a Molotov. The reader is never sure which is worse, the situation inside the club or the zombie menace outside!Fast paced with a truly great cast of characters, I thought the entire time I was reading that this should be scripted as a play or a show. Perhaps this is due to being primarily in one location but I also think the characters came so alive and had such realistic relationships. The incredible attention Mr. Woodhead pays to expressing his characters internal thoughts and emotions is impressive.Ian has established himself as a creative wizard and fans will appreciate this sequel. I am looking forward to the third in this series and I have no idea how he will outdo himself! I would also like to pay homage to the fantastic cover art created by Peter Fussey. Another genius in the field it was fitting he should join forces with Ian Woodhead on this project.(4 stars due to typos and the short length of the story)"}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5108317-mark", "userReview": "Ian Woodhead has once again shown himself to be a master of zombie mayhem with his latest work, Walking With Zombies, to provide a gritty \u2013 and suitably gory \u2013 follow up to his novel The Unwashed Dead.The story isn\u2019t a straightforward sequel, with events picking up where the previous work left off, rather the story runs parallel, but it takes the slaughter-fest into the wider city. Infection is spreading through Bradford, turning the unsuspecting residents into zombie hordes, and for the staff and clientele of the Stockholm Club, it all means they\u2019re in for one Hell of a night.Walking With Zombies is a novella, but it has everything you\u2019d expect to find in a good zombie tale: gruesome death, gore, and a disparate group of people thrown together in a do-or-die effort to stay alive against the odds. And it\u2019s all painted in living detail by an author who not only has an affectionate rapport with his characters and his subject matter, but who is also a talented storyteller."}, {"userName": "Katy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5552109-katy", "userReview": "Book Info: Genre: Horror/ZombiesReading Level: AdultDisclosure: I received a free copy of this eBook from the author in exchange for an honest review.Synopsis: Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the Stockholm Club.

Whole neighbourhoods are falling to the undead plague. On the outskirts, the staff and customers of the Stockholm Club have no idea that the moaning dead are slowly shambling towards them. My Thoughts: This is book two of the Zombie Armageddon series by Ian Woodhead, following The Unwashed Dead. Book 3 is called Infected Bodies, just FYI. I read The Unwashed Dead just a couple of days ago and quite liked it, despite my general preference to avoid traditional zombie fiction. Despite a need for additional editing, it was quite a fun read. Walking with Zombies was even better. Again the book started with various character vignettes, but in this case all characters had a commonality in the Stockholm Club, and as the story progressed, the characters gradually consolidated into the same location. Fascinating, fast-paced, and with some unconventional twists that I quite enjoyed, this is a feast for zombie lovers. Check it out!"}, {"userName": "Denna", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/948231-denna", "userReview": "I read the first one, The Unwashed Dead, and thought it was just a fast, fun, no-brainer zombie story that I could get lost in for a few hours. Characters didn\u2019t have depth, but then who cared, I enjoyed the read and this is what mattered. So I went ahead and picked up the second one right away, Walking with Zombies, thinking I\u2019d get another that probably would rate in the same category as the first one. What a thrilling surprise to find that characters were built up to a much higher level in this one. Not only were the characters distinct from one another, but the plot was more developed, even adding a new twist on an old tale. I\u2019m not going to give it away because if you like zombie stories, you\u2019re going to love this! So why only three stars, you ask? As with the first novel, it could have used a couple more rounds of editing before it went to print. If I hadn\u2019t been so caught up in the story, I guarantee you this would have ended up in my \u201cCan\u2019t Finish\u201d list, it\u2019s that bad where grammar and punctuation are concerned. Second reason, and one that almost dropped it down to a two star review, the ending just stopped in mid action, chopped off to begin in the third novel, I guess. Really irritating, but I feel this is something I can\u2019t overlook when giving out a review. Even series novels should have something of a beginning, middle, and end. This one didn\u2019t. Would I still encourage you to read it? You bet. It\u2019s a fun story\u2014if you like zombies and a lot of gore. I\u2019ll probably pick up the next one in line and hope Ian Woodhead can keep up the good work with characters and plot, but this time give me a satisfactory ending. If not he\u2019ll take a big risk in losing me as a loyal fan."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "4 1/2 stars I read The Unwashed Dead, the first book in the Zombie Armageddon series by Ian Woodhead last year, and I really enjoyed the setting and the grimy goriness of Mr. Woodhead's storytelling. So I was more than excited to start reading Walking With Zombies.Set in the North of England, with regular-joe kind of characters, and some seriously gross zombie action, I was hooked into the story right from the beginning. As a short book (almost novella size), it's almost essential to jump straight into the fray, but Mr. Woodhead does it in a way that also gives the characters a chance to shine. From mummys-boy Dominic, to the truly screwed up Talbot, and a slew of characters that fall victim to the undead horde in any number of creative ways, all the characters are realistic and easily distinguishable from each other. The dialogue rings completely true, and there's a real feeling of a gritty northern town. Although the story jumps between several characters, it works very well as a way of both introducing characters and showing exactly what is going down around the town.Walking With Zombies is not a continuation of The Unwashed Dead, it is more of a parallel story, set mostly in and around the Stockholm Club, and has even more of the zombie craziness than the first book - along with some pretty unique ideas on infection and spread of the virus. Several pop-culture references made me smile, and some truly stomach-turning scenes made me wince.I devoured this book within a couple of hours, and I can't wait to read the next one in the series.Read more of my reviews at The Aussie Zombie"}, {"userName": "Space Out With Sci Fi in June The Haunted Reading Room", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7302570-space-out-with-sci-fi-in-june-the-haunted-reading-room", "userReview": "Review of Walking with Zombies by Ian Woodhead (Zombie Armageddon #2)5 StarsI\u2019ve read enough of Mr. Woodhead\u2019s prolific Zombie novels to know two things: Mr. Woodhead, like his devoted fan base, loves Zombies and Zombiefication; and second, Mr. Woodhead\u2019s Zombies are special. Not for him only the brainless, mindless, brain-crunching dead creatures to which most of us attribute the Zombie appellation. No, some of the characters here are not just \u201cbrainy,\u201d they\u2019re thinkers-planners-logical-and even gifted. We\u2019ve got a guy here, a really despicable, dislikable character in life, a domestic abuser, a kneebreaker, violent, irritable, but a snappy dresser\u2014who gets \u201cturned\u201d and comes back as a new \u201cbreed,\u201d one whose bites makes thinkers, euphoric, with actual mental telepathy! Now I\u2019ve NEVER seen that anywhere in the various venues of Zombieland; but it sure is fun! And so is the subtle humour underlying the entire story.

The character of Talbot has a nasty thread but where will it lead?This time IW concentrates most of the action on a small night club, which has amazing pies, made me hungry! Very random.New people are thrown into the mix and the clashing of personalities brings a new element to the story.The final showdown is pretty tense and the outcome is another cliffhanger moment begging you to read book no.3.I did wonder why there was no mention of the group of survivors from book no.1"}, {"userName": "Lee Emerick", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5640743-lee-emerick", "userReview": "Edit:- Bumped my rating up to four stars after reading it a second time. It really is a good story with niggles aside :)Why no ending? Like the first book it left me a little disappointed as it abruptly ends mid flow following a fantastic story. Don't get me wrong, although I have given 3 stars, I really enjoyed the book. Ians style of writing really gets the juices flowing. The characters were great, plot marvellous, really set the scene, drew me in no end yet it just stopped leaving me upset that I did not know what happened to them. As with the first book there were many mistakes but they are silly things like repeated / incorrect words that spell check is probably to stupid to notice.
