Not that this is all sweetness and light, though there is plenty of that too. A Russian family, Christians in a dictatorship, escape from Moscow where they were in danger, making a new life in Oregon, secrets they carry with them. There is so much humor, food with unusual names, descriptions of decorating and homes, life living on a tugboat, and one large, loving and unusual family.I fell in love with this family, all of them and found myself wishing I could be part of them. The neighbors on the pier, living in various types of house boats. Old Daisy, wonderful, slowly losing herself to dementia but such a quirky unusual and loyal person. The three sisters and their unique and unusual bond, the secret surrounding their adopted brother. Love the tone of this book, the message that anything cam be overcome with loving friends and a loving family.Yes, sometimes it is a bit schmaltzy, a bit sweet, predictable even but it didn't matter. The characters and the humor, sometimes laugh out loud funny, overcame all the things I usually avoid in a book. A good story, a feel good story, a book that leaves you with a good feeling. How special is that?"}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "3+ stars. I feel a bit conflicted about The Language of Sisters. I liked the basic story and characters, and I really liked the background story set in the Soviet Union, but it was way too long and dragged out the secrets and tension way too much. I also didn't love the touch of magic. The story is narrated by Toni, one of three adult sisters. The sisters live in Portland, Oregon, surrounded by their parents, aunts, uncles and cousins who all immigrated to the US from the Soviet Union. Toni has a lot of baggage -- recent events involving a marriage and childhood events that occurred in the Soviet Union. As the book progresses, Toni's secrets slowly unfold and they are in fact heartbreaking. What kept me reading is Toni's lovely family -- the book depicts a funny, wounded and resilient family that has had to deal with more than its share of hardship. These are not cookie cutter characters, and it was hard not to like them. I also loved Toni's living arrangements; she lives on a reconditioned tugboat amongst a community of eccentric houseboat dwelllers. But, again, the book is way longer than necessary and I did find myself losing patience with much of the middle part in which I felt dragged along by the promise that Toni's secrets would finally be revealed. Fortunately, the end does pick up. Despite the sad stuff, this qualifies more as a light read -- flawed but still compelling. Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "Charming, witty, occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, this is the story of leaving another life, another way of life, behind, coming to America and building a new life. Sometimes, though, the things you thought you left behind, buried deep in memories, resurface. You keep trying to shove them back down, only to have someone else work harder to release the buried past. The characters in this story are ones you will remember, all the generations, all the people, but especially sisters Elvira, Toni and Valerie and their mother. They all have the language of sisters and brothers, an ability to know what the other is thinking.\u201cWe can hear each other, inside our heads when something is wrong, or when something is especially beautiful. Now and then we can feel each other. \u201cThere are the usual family ins and outs to navigate, parents worrying about children, children causing their parents distress. Unfulfilling jobs, the daily stresses of life. Then there are other, more serious issues, but this family pulls together, even when some may want to push away, deal with their pain alone. The additional characters add even more quirkiness and colour to this story of a family who leaves Russia for a new, more freedom-filled life in Oregon. Unable to resume their former professions, they eventually end up running, owning a restaurant in their new home. I loved the scenes in the restaurant, the naming of the dishes, and the pier where Toni has made a new home in a Tugboat offers another group of people who tend to Toni as though they were family, all looking out for one another. Daisy, their eccentric and unpredictable senior member, watching over them all, while they all watch over Daisy as her mind slowly fades away. This is not all light and laughs, there are darker moments, dark memories, but I enjoyed reading about this family so filled with love that their love illuminates the darkness."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3076351-kathryn", "userReview": "I really don't know where to begin talking about this book. Cathy Lamb is an author whose work I have come to enjoy in the last couple of years - thanks to an Australian blogger at Book'd Out. Lamb's books just so satisfy my reading heart.Toni is the narrator, one of three sisters who have a very special bond. They began their lives in Russia in the 80's where it was dangerous for them. They were under the eye of the KGB and their large extended family were quietly escaping to the USA. While the story begins in America, every so often we go back to that time in Russia until every little horrific detail of that time is revealed. One of the mysteries that Toni holds a little part - how did their brother arrive to them one bloody night?Toni is at a low point in her life and it takes awhile to find out all the details. She lives on a converted tugboat ( and I want one) at a dock. Surrounding her are a wonderful group of people who are a little community that really watches out for each other. Daisy - an old woman just sinking into dementia is a treat. And of course then there is the DEA agent Nick who just adores Toni.Valerie - Toni's sister is a prosecutor and is dealing with a particularly bad case - one that threatens her. Ellie is engaged to be married but has to keep breathing into a paper bag to deal with all the stress and differing opinions with her fiance. These girls and their brother are part of a large extended family. Their parents are such fun, despite all that they went through in Russia, they love each other, run a very successful restaurant. Uncles, aunts, cousins abound. They are all such a hoot.This book kept me reading, I wanted to find out all of Toni's story, I wanted to know what the secret was that they were keeping from Dmitry. I chuckled so many times. There were moments of sadness. The love in this family just won me over. Even if they were in your face nosy and interfering at times!"}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12497297-kathryn", "userReview": "Honestly not quite sure how Cathy Lamb pulled off this novel. Experience may be the only answer. So many of the book's early pages are introducing her sprawling cast of characters: protagonist Toni Kozlovsky, her huge Russian-American family, and her neighbors at the docks where Toni rents a slip for the tugboat she lives on. There are subplots for most of these characters that would typically have me either creating a spreadsheet or setting the book down in exasperation. Yet the characters are so quirky, and their dilemmas concerning the safety of home and family so distinctive and relatable, that I suffered not one moment of the anxiety that a lesser author would have invoked. While Lamb had me giggling by page 18, it was the novel's ongoing romantic tension braided with the darker undercurrent of unresolved secrets in the family's backstory in the Communist-controlled Soviet Union that kept me glued to her pages. And somehow, at the end of this 450-page book, every subplot came to a satisfying resolution. A highly entertaining and heartwarming read."}, {"userName": "Jenny Belk", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30242974-jenny-belk", "userReview": "I was fortunate to receive an ARC of Cathy's newest book. This is my honest and unsolicited review:This is a story of the Koslovsky family, immigrants from Communist Russia. There's papa Alexei, Svetlana, mother to three daughters-Toni, Valerie and Ellie, and one son-Dimitry. It's a close knit family who love one another deeply. There are family secrets that must never be revealed. Memories that are best not discussed, but never forgotten.Each member of the family has their own story to tell. It's in their individual stories that you learn who they really are, what they have experienced and what's ahead for them. It's a story about enduring love of family, hope, redemption and forgiveness. With Cathy Lamb's trademark compassion and humor, she manages to weave a memorable story about overcoming a tragic past while at the same time making you laugh out loud, a lot. I adored the amazing cast of quirky characters. Cathy Lamb has outdone herself."}, {"userName": "Michelegg", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/253691-michelegg", "userReview": "I can't remember the last time I read a book and I fell so in love with the characters in it. I cried like a baby at the end, not just because it was a marvelous ending but also because I am truly going to miss these people. They have been my friends for the past couple of days and I will miss being a part of their lives. You may think that sounds silly, but such is the power of Cathy Lamb and her brilliant words. I grew to adore Toni. I cried with her and I giggled with her and I fell in love with her DEA agent right along with her. I also adored her sisters and her brother. And I cried so much as their story unfolded. I loved her extended family, especially her parents. They were delightful. As always Cathy Lamb writes characters that I feel like I know and I love them and I will remember them for years to come. I feel like this is the best of all of this authors work.

What a beautiful cover!Cathy Lamb  renders another heartfelt story of family and secrets -THE LANGUAGE OF SISTERS.  An engrossing family saga linked by blood, marriage, and long-held secrets and special sisterly bonds. Meet the Kozlovskys.  A huge loving family. They had survived. They have endured much hardship in Moscow. Their father barely so, their mother only through endless grit and determination-- but they are here in Oregon-a noisy family who does not talk about what happened back in Russia, twenty-five years ago. It is best to forget.  Their parents have told them many times. The things they hide. After all, they are Americans now. Could they cover their past?Toni Kozlovsky, (Antonia) the narrator lives on a dock in a marina in Oregon with other people who live on houseboats. She has a three story yellow tugboat with red rails and trim and a red door. She wanted to live on the water and a friend of her fathers retired and moved to Miami and her she was. She renovated and rented a slip on the dock and settled in her thousand square feet of space. She needs her space from things going on in her life. She also keeps things in her other side of the house (a shelter with a door) which locks away her past.She is presently a crime and justice reporter. Valerie an attorney, and Ellie is engaged to an Italian. Their parents, who own \"Svetlana's Kitchen\" and a group of wonderful aunts, uncles and lots of cousins.Three sisters:  Toni, Valerie, and Ellie grew up in Communist Russia. The girls have a special gift of being able to hear each other in their heads. (A gift from their mother). It may be rare, and it comes in emotionally intense times, when they are worried, scared, in danger, falling apart, or conversely when something perfect happens to all of them. Some say they are making it up and only think they each other since they are sisters, best friends, and are in tune with each other. They know the truth. From the Sabonis line, like genes, through their widow\u2019s peaks. From the Romanovs, to Lenin, Stalin, Germany\u2019s invasion, the siege of Leningrad, the Cold War, they have heard one another.\u201cPassed from mother to daughter. Father to son. Sisters and brothers, we hear each other. It\u2019s a gift. It\u2019s a curse.\u201d American Russians.  They had lost it all. They came here worked hard, stayed sane, and they are better people for their experience. They fight, love, drink, and laugh. A secret keeper. For twenty-five years. Can she unburden herself?From quirky characters,  good food, wine, wit, fears, laughter, secrets, siblings, friends, a blue heron, Daisy (loved her), a DEA agent, a restaurant, and Nick. There is also the adopted brother, Dmitry- he came to live with them in Moscow.They have shared secrets and joys and it\u2019s the language of brothers. and the language of sisters.What a beautifully written story  told with humor and compassion! You will cry and laugh. Loved the column titled \u201cLiving on a Tugboat: and the love connection. A \"must read\" for lovers of family sagas. An ideal choice for book clubs and group discussions (guide included).

I loved everything about it - the characters, the story line, the love and the wonderful sounding Russian foods that were discussed. Cathy Lamb has done it again and written a book that with characters who won't soon be forgotten. This book has a little bit of everything - mystery (what was the secret that no one was supposed to discuss?), drama (will the trial end without Valerie being hurt or killed?), love (will Toni learn to love again?), food ( what will be special be named at Svetlana's Kitchen tonight?). Most important of all it shows the love and connection between sisters and the entire Kozlovsky clan. The book made me laugh (I loved Svetlana and the food she cooked) and it made me cry (the things that happened to the family before they emigrated from Russian were difficult to read) but it was full of a fantastic family that I loved reading about and will remember long after the book is finished.I highly recommend this book!(Thanks to NetGalley for a copy of this book in exchange for a fair and honest review.)"}, {"userName": "Jill Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12626044-jill-anderson", "userReview": "This is a book worthy of a whole weekend.

I have loved every book with Cathy Lamb's name on the jacket, but The Language of Sisters left me in a quandary. Parts of the story are incredibly powerful; other parts are too drawn out. Despite assigning only three stars, I do not consider the book to be average, but it did not live up to my high expectations. The Kozlovsky family emigrated from the Soviet Union to Oregon twenty-five years prior to the beginning of the story, which is narrated by Antonia, one of three daughters. She and her sisters, Ellie and Valerie, share a fascinating bond. They can communicate with one another merely by thinking. Lest anyone finds this phenomenon fantastical, I had a similar connection with my sister and am a believer in the language of sisters.The Kozlovskys lived a horrific life under the Soviet Communist regime. As non-Communist members of the intelligentsia and devout Christians, the parents were persecuted and reduced to living in unthinkable poverty. For me, the narrative from Moscow is the most powerful writing in the book. The description of a family of five, which included three young children, is straightforward yet heartbreaking. Despite the success they achieve in America as the result of back breaking work, the lives of the Kozlovskys is forever shaped by the years in Moscow.One of my favorite characteristics about Cathy Lamb is her quirkiness. She creates immensely lovable characters in The Language of Sisters. From Antonia's home on her yellow tugboat with its red smokestack to Svetlana's restaurant menu that chronicles family events and secrets, I grew quickly fond of the large extended American-Russian family. I was reminded of a Russian restaurant in Brighton Beach, NY, an enclave of Russian immigrants. Regardless of nationality, we were all Russians to the family who owned it.Although I loved the family and Antonia's houseboat neighbors, the story began to drag for me. The minute details of neighbor Daisy's attire were hilarious the first couple times I read them, but like other minutiae, they became repetitive enough to be annoying. The book became unnecessarily long, such that the climax of the story almost becomes lost.It truly pains me to write a so-so review of a book written by a woman I have always felt a connection with. Perhaps my expectations were too high. That said, though, I would recommend the book. This review is clearly in the minority."}, {"userName": "Susan Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10178397-susan-peterson", "userReview": "Amazing, heartfelt story The Language of Sisters is a beautiful, heartfelt story of sisters and families, of love and second chances, and of the glory of people coming together.

She has a common template: a close, crazy family; flawed characters who are challenged, learn and grow; style of some sort (clothes, shoes, lingerie); a hunky man who has to win his lady love; and some social cause/concern. At times, her writing soars; other times, I simply applaud her effort. This book was not her best. It seemed formulaic and, often, it tried too hard. There were gaps or leaps or mistakes in sections.

Hot romances and work situations.Kind of funny that one sister is a lawyer and is charge of bringing those to justice and her teaches the twins about self defense and they bring it to class for show and tell and the teacher gets upset when she explains how to get out of trunk of a car if kidnapped.

Like, a lot.Honestly, this is my first Cathy Lamb book and it won't be my last. This woman can write, and write some more. Reading THE LANGUAGE OF SISTERS was one of the best reading experiences I've had in a long time; I laughed, I cried, most of the time, I didn't even realize I was reading. It's that good.The Koslovsky family is a bustling American-Russian family living in Oregon, immigrants from Communist Russia. They have secrets, they have traumatic scars, but most of all--they have each other. The main protagonist is Antonia (Toni) Koslovsky, the middle daughter of three sisters (Ellie, the youngest and Valeria, the oldest). They have a brother, Dmitri, too. The cover of the book would have you believing the sisters are young, but they are grown, adult children with lives, jobs, and families (Valerie) of their own. The cover might also have you believing this is a saccharine story of girls dancing around May poles, but it is a sophisticated romp through grief, heartache, love, family dynamics (and dysfunction); a story of home, a narrative of mystery. Told in a nonlinear fashion, in which glimpses of Communist Moscow surface as a dark nebulous coloring present-day shenanigans, THE LANGUAGE OF SISTERS is at once a mystery (what were some of these deeply held secrets? Why? And a subplot involving a prosecutor), a poignant story of family told with compassion, warmth, and humor. Honestly, I don't know how the author pulled this one off...it's complex in character, and contains so many subplots, yet she pulls them together beautifully. And with humor. Did I mention humor?Like other Kensington books, this one reminds me a bit of Ariella Cohen's THE SWEET BREATH OF MYSTERY, and some of T. Greenwood's earlier works.

The narrator of the book is Antonia, a crime reporter for the Oregon Standard, so it is implausible that she would not be eloquent in the telling of her family's story.The Language of Sisters is the story of the Kozlovsky family, who emigrated from Russia to Oregon twenty-five years before the book takes place.

Having suffered greatly in Russia, the three sisters and their parents know the value of hard work and have been successful in their endeavors since coming to America.

The family bond does come through clearly in The Language of Sisters, but I found my mind wandering as the author waded through the tiny details of their everyday lives. Most compelling was the story of their lives in Russia, but the author spent very little time on the details. Although The Language of Sisters was a miss for me, other readers might find this more to their liking."}, {"userName": "Carol Boyer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24894451-carol-boyer", "userReview": "I found myself so immersed in this wonderful family saga and their secrets, from their old and tragic days in Russia to living now in America with the three sisters, that the title and cover of this book so beautifully display. Toni, Valerie and Ellie hear each others voices in their heads and know immediately of their siblings deepest fears, and desires. They remember the hard times of having to be pickpockets in Russia, to survive, know the evil of the KGB which forced them to hide, lest the family be found out for their different beliefs and beaten, put into jail or killed. The back and forth of the present is portrayed with great heart, depth, infectious dialogue and humor. There are secrets that no one ever dares tell. I laughed out loud when the mother, Svetalana names each of her famous culinary dishes after one of her daughters embarrassing traits, like one she called \"My childrens make me worry\". There is deep ongoing grief, and a captivating love story which is in question between Toni, her love of Marty and Nick. Cathy Lamb writes with deep compassion, her richness of emotion make you cry, and you feel like you are living inside this amazing book."}, {"userName": "Sue Seligman", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/821912-sue-seligman", "userReview": "I have not read any books by this author but I think I will have to now. This is a poignant, funny, sad, and emotional story of a family who had emigrated from Russia and established a business and life in Oregon. The focus is on the three sisters, Toni, Ellie, and Valerie. Since childhood they have possessed the uncanny ability of being able to communicate with one another through their thoughts. Their mother says the talent is centered in the family \"widow's peak\". This talent has enabled them to support each other through good times and bad, and has even resulted in life saving situations. The plot is told through glimpses of the difficult past in Russia, and through their current lives, tragedies and triumphs. The portrait of the extended family provides some comic relief between the episodes of heartache and loss. An excellent story of family and friendship, sisterhood, love and loss. A great read."}, {"userName": "Christine Moore", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16231256-christine-moore", "userReview": "Thank you so very much to NetGalley and Kensington Books for allowing me to review this wonderful book by Cathy Lamb, The Language of Sisters!!! It was simply amazing. It is a story about Toni and her 2 sisters Valerie and Ellie. They were born in Russia but moved to the United States with their parents and adopted brother when they were little girls. Each sister has their own story line and all 3 sisters are amazing characters. Toni's story is a story of a love lost. Valerie is a prosecutor who is married with 2 lovely children. Ellie's story is of trying to find the perfect love and life. I lived inside this book. I want to be a Koslovsky sister. It is an amazing story that everyone should read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a book you can dive into and love all aspects of the story. I have read many Cathy Lamb books and loved them all but she has truly out did herself with this book!!!"}, {"userName": "Megalion", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14853675-megalion", "userReview": "I've loved Cathy Lamb since I read The Last Time I was Me. When I feel like women's fiction (not chick lit), she's one of my go to authors. This one was different than the others that I've read in that it is about a large Russian family who fled to the US during WWII. It celebrates their family bonds and how they cope together. Every one of her books features a delightfully quirky character and I loved how she drew the one in this book. This one also features a touch of magical realism much like Sarah Addison's books. The title is derived from it. The only thing I'll note, the various troubles that the family faces tend to resolve too smoothly. Everything is a happy ending with no hiccups. Just a forewarning if this is an irritation for you. Recommended. Thanks to the publisher for the advanced copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Denise Hisey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8238423-denise-hisey", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the main story line, and the way the author tied in the past from Russia to the present. I also like the setting in Portland Oregon since I'm familiar with the area. I wasn't a huge fan of the \"magic\" language between the sisters, or the poor English spoken by the parents -considering they were highly educated and had been living in America for several decades. I felt it was enough o a contradiction that it affected the story's authenticity. But it was an easy read, and there were a lot of poignant moments I enjoyed. I liked it well enough I plan to check out more of her books."}, {"userName": "Jonda Beattie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52084338-jonda-beattie", "userReview": "I enjoyed the closeness of the sisters and the close family ties. I was a bit distressed that the family secrets were kept from the brother for so long. While I loved the characters, I wanted them all to go to therapy. Loved the description of the houseboat community and enjoyed the brief descriptions of Moscow."}], "description": "From acclaimed author Cathy Lamb comes a warm and thoughtful novel about the secrets that can break or unite a family\u2014and the voices that resonate throughout our lives... \u00a0 Toni Kozlovsky can\u2019t explain how she knows exactly what her sisters are feeling\u2014only that the connection seems to happen out of the blue, just when they need it most. Since Toni, Valerie, and Ellie were little girls growing up in Communist Russia, their parents have insisted it\u2019s simply further proof that the Kozlovskys are special and different. \u00a0 Now a crime and justice reporter, Toni lives on a yellow tugboat on Oregon\u2019s Willamette River. As far as her parents are concerned, the pain of their old life and their dangerous escape should remain buried in the Moscow they left behind, as should the mysterious past of their adopted brother, Dmitry. But lately, Toni\u2019s talent for putting on a smile isn\u2019t enough to keep memories at bay. \u00a0 Valerie, a prosecuting attorney, wages constant war against the wrongs she could do nothing about as a child. Youngest sister Ellie is engaged to marry an Italian, breaking her mother\u2019s heart in the process. Toni fears she\u2019s about to lose her home, while the hard edged DEA agent down the dock keeps trying to break through her reserve. Meanwhile, beneath the culture clashes and endearing quirks within her huge, noisy, loving family are deeper secrets that Toni has sworn to keep\u2014even from the one person she longs to help most. \u00a0 As poignant as it is humorous, The Language of Sisters explores the echoes of the past that can cling to the present\u2014and how love, laughter, and family can rescue us time and again.", "title": "The Language of Sisters", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28109831-the-language-of-sisters", "average": 4.24, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1453059145l/28109831.jpg", "reviews": 144, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/422343.Cathy_Lamb", "name": "Cathy Lamb"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Contemporary", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28109831-the-language-of-sisters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28109676-the-language-of-sisters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28589419-the-language-of-sisters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/807108.Julia_s_Chocolates", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6131767-henry-s-sisters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2502880.The_Last_Time_I_Was_Me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7714109-such-a-pretty-face", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9643875-the-first-day-of-the-rest-of-my-life"]}
