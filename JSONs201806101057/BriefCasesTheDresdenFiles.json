Harry, a talented wizard (despite some flaws), is the main character in most of the stories, but not all. My favorite story may have been the first one, \u201cA Fistful of Warlocks,\u201d set back in Old West times. Anastasia is a wizard and a Warden of the White Council of wizards, sent to Dodge City to apprehend a murderous warlock. She gets some help from a n\u00e4cken (a sometimes treacherous shapeshifting water spirit) and a deputy ... who will be familiar to anyone who knows anything about the American Old West. Loved it! Another standout is the last story, where the same period of time and overlapping events are told by Harry and two other characters, one of whom is Mouse, a very large and magical dog. Each character sheds his or her own light on the events, which build on each other and was insightful and even touching.And then there's the enjoyable trio of stories about Bigfoot and his son by a human woman ...These twelve stories are set at various points in the DRESDEN FILES series, and there are definitely some spoilers relating to things that happen to some key characters in that series. It's helpful to be at least somewhat familiar with the series before launching into reading these stories. On the other hand, this collection would also be a reasonable way to check out the series if you're new to it (again, if you don't mind some spoilers for later books).Full review to come, after it posts on Fantasy Literature. I received a free copy of this ebook from the publisher through NetGalley.

I have loved his books even before he had the TV show. I love the imagination, creativity, and the humor. This book is another one of those books! Several short stories creative characters and plots that kept me interested from beginning to the end. They also have just enough snark and wit! There were several stories about Bigfoot and a really great one about Dodge City and Mr. Earp. But in that last story there were wizards and strange creatures to ride on that did not sound like horses! That was my favorite. A fun read."}, {"userName": "Chris Evans", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41096515-chris-evans", "userReview": "I remember a time when these nice short stories use to be fun little reads between the yearly main line books... instead of the only thing published for years."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "3.5 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2018/06/05/...Hard to believe it has been four years since the release of the last Dresden Files book, and sure, fans might have a little longer to wait until Peace Talks, but for now, an anthology would tide me over quite nicely. Peace Talks is a collection of new and old (but mostly old) short fiction that takes place in the world of Harry Dresden, collected in one convenient volume. Together with the previous anthology Side Jobs, these books give you a chance to catch up with all the stories if you haven\u2019t had a chance to do so yet.A more detailed review of the contents:A FISTFUL OF WARLOCKSThe opening story is a Western, as evidenced by its title, following Anastasia Luccio long before she has achieved the post of commander of White Council wardens. Riding in pursuit of a rogue warlock named Alexander Page, Luccio heads into Dodge City where she meets Wyatt Earp and teams up with him to take on a couple of necromancers.In his foreword for this story, Jim Butcher writes: \u201cSome stories happen because a writer gets inspired by some wild idea that needs expression. Some stories are carefully put together as part of a greater whole. And some stories you write because a professional friend asks you if you want to contribute to an anthology, and it sounds like a really fun idea.\u201d This third reason given is why I typically don\u2019t tend to read \u201cside stories\u201d that are tacked onto a main series, preferring the \u201cinspired\u201d and \u201ccarefully put together\u201d ones instead. Plus, with any series, I always seem to end up forming attachments to only a small number of characters, and as such, I find I have very little interest in novellas or shorts that feature the perspectives of other minor characters or people in the series universe.I\u2019m guessing this is why I didn\u2019t like this story as much as I\u2019d hoped. To be honest, I barely remember Anastasia Luccio from the main series, and while meeting Wyatt Earp was kinda cool and on the whole this was a fun little story, A Fistful of Warlocks still had that \u201cthrowaway\u201d vibe to it that makes me doubt it will stick in my mind for very long.B IS FOR BIGFOOTI had much better luck with B is for Bigfoot, which is also the first story of what is now known as Butcher\u2019s \u201cBigfoot trilogy\u201d, a trio of short stories featuring Harry Dresden and his interactions with the Sasquatch known as River Shoulders. In this one, Harry is hired to help Irwin Pounder, River Shoulders\u2019 son who lives with his human mother. It seems lately that Irwin has been having some trouble at school, and Harry takes it upon himself to give the boy a talk about bullies. For such a short tale, this one had a lot of heart, and both River Shoulders and Irwin are great additions to the Dresden universe.AAAA WIZARDRYOriginally included in the manual Dresden Files RPG: Core Rulebook Volume 2 \u2013 Our World, this short story shows Harry in a role of teacher to a group of young wardens. I liked how it featured another side of the character, though plot-wise it was a bit undeveloped. Since the tale was first published in an RPG rulebook about the many different factions, people, and creatures of the Dresdenverse, I didn\u2019t really expect a lot from it, but I had hoped that it would be a bit more memorable.I WAS A TEENAGE BIGFOOTWe\u2019re back to River Shoulders and Irwin Pounder in this story, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. This time, Irwin is a little older, attending the prestigious Saint Mark\u2019s Academy for the Gifted and Talented. But his supernatural origins might have attracted some unwanted attention, so his mother Dr. Helena Pounder hires Harry to keep an eye on her son. Sure enough, when Irwin gets sick, Harry is not convinced that it\u2019s just a simple case of mono. These Bigfoot stories are becoming the highlight of this anthology, and this one had a funny twist at the end too that had me laughing. I had a great time with this one.CURSESSet between Small Favor and Turn Coat, this story begins when a man walks into Harry\u2019s office attempting to hire him to remove the curse that was supposed placed on the Chicago Cubs during the 1945 World Series. It was an interesting premise, but I just didn\u2019t find myself too invested in the story, though I\u2019m sure it would be immensely more fun for baseball fans or Chicago natives. At the very least, I got to learn some new things surrounding what is known as the Billy Goat Curse.EVEN HANDSet between Turn Coat and Changes, this story is told from the perspective of one of the series\u2019 most notorious characters, the mob boss known as \u201cGentleman\u201d John Marcone. Things begin in his office with a visit from Justine, who arrives with a child in tow, claiming that she is being pursued by the Fomor, a race of water-dwelling creatures. Justine wants protection from Marcone, who is about to turn her away until the leader of the Fomor himself crashes his headquarters, changing the situation. I\u2019ll be honest; I was a never a big fan of John Marcone, even though he\u2019s one of the most prominent characters of the Dresden Files series, having been around since the beginning. That said, I\u2019ve always liked the complexity behind his personality and motivations, and this one did a nice job showing him operating in his own world.BIGFOOT ON CAMPUSAnd so ends the Bigfoot trilogy with this final River Shoulders story about Harry helping Irwin Pounder for the third time. Irwin is now all grown up and in college, playing on the football team, dating a pretty girl, and generally busy doing college student things. However, when it is discovered that Irwin\u2019s girlfriend Connie Barrowill is a vampire of the White Court, Harry goes to let River Shoulders know that his son may be in danger. But as always, things are never as they seem, especially when it turns out Connie is also unaware of her true nature. Things turn a little dark in this Bigfoot story, but I loved the deeper themes in the end about fatherhood and trusting in your children to make their own way.BOMBSHELLSA story about Molly Carpenter, Bombshells follows Harry\u2019s apprentice showing how she\u2019s been dealing with life since the death of her mentor. This one also begins with the sudden appearance of Justine, who shows up on Molly\u2019s doorstep asking for help looking for her lover Thomas, who is also Harry\u2019s half-brother. For a series I love so much, sometimes it surprises me how few of the key characters actually resonate with me. Molly is another member of the main cast whom I\u2019ve never really felt much for, which might explain why I felt so apathetic about this story. It has only been a few days since I finished reading it, but I\u2019ve forgotten many details from it already.COLD CASEAnother Molly story, but I fared a lot better with this one. Cold Case begins with Mab, the Queen of Air and Darkness, charging Molly to collect an overdue tribute owed to the Winter Court. While on her mission, Molly meets up with Carlos Ramirez, a young warden of the Wizard Council, and they strike up a fast friendship and become intimate with each other. Unbeknownst to Molly, however, when she agreed to take on the Winter\u2019s Lady mantle, certain unpleasant \u201crules\u201d came attached. Admittedly, this story didn\u2019t really wow me until near the end, when the revelations of the mantle\u2019s influence finally hit me like a punch in the gut. I really felt bad for Molly then, and Butcher did such a great job writing her anger, frustration, and loneliness.JURY DUTYIn this story, Harry is summoned for the direst and most unpleasant of tasks\u2014jury duty. A man named Hamilton Luther is under trial for the murder, and it appears to be a straightforward case until information surfaces about the possible presence of little girl at the crime scene, who would be a key witness\u2014if she could be found. Deciding to take matters into his own hands, Harry follows the girl\u2019s trail and discovers that she has been abducted by a vampire of the White Court. Featuring a mix of action and humor, this was one of the more entertaining and interesting stories of the collection.DAY ONEYay, a Butters story! I was excited about this one, because here\u2019s a side character from the series that I actually am quite fond of. Day One follows Butters as he embarks on a mission to track down a supernatural predator who has been targeting children, feeding on their nightmares and turning the kids into paranoid and sleepless husks. I have a soft spot for geeks and nerd characters, which is probably why I like Butters so much. Characters like him don\u2019t get much of a chance to shine, so when they get to be the stars of their own stories, however short they are, I take notice. Plus, this one had a hilarious World of Warcraft reference, and because I just happen to be an avid pet collector in that game, huge points for that bit about the murloc egg.ZOO DAYTold in three parts, Zoo Day is the only story completely original to this anthology and hasn\u2019t appeared before anywhere else. In it, Harry takes Maggie and Mouse to the zoo, and father are daughter get some quality time to get to know each other. That is, until a fledgling warlock interrupts their plans. These series of events are depicted three times, first from the perspective of Harry, then Maggie, and finally Mouse. This is a story that does many things, but I mainly liked it for showing Harry trying to be a good parent, and Maggie learning what kind of man her dad is. Their nervousness around each other really pulled on my heartstrings, especially with both of scared that they would be a disappointment to the other, when there is in fact no need for worry on that front. It\u2019s immediately clear that the two of them are cut from the same cloth, in that they both have big hearts and want to help others. This was a sweet and touching tale to end the anthology, showing that despite all the troubles in Harry\u2019s busy life, he still strives to make time for his daughter, recalling the loneliness he felt growing up without his parents. Mouse\u2019s POV also succeeded in adding a little levity, because who doesn\u2019t love getting a story from a dog\u2019s perspective?All in all, Brief Cases was a good read. I\u2019m not usually one to pick up short fiction, but I absolutely would not hesitate to make an exception for an anthology like this one, mainly because the stories are in the world of a series I love. While it\u2019s true that most of these fell into the \u201cokay\u201d to \u201cgood\u201d category, there were some that were truly excellent, like the Bigfoot trilogy, that made it all worth it. Needless to say, if you\u2019re a fan of the Dresden Files or Jim Butcher, this anthology is not to be missed."}, {"userName": "Karl", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1935255-karl", "userReview": "Contents:001 - \u201cA Fistful of Warlocks\u201d029 - \u201cB Is for Bigfoot\u201d061 - \u201cAAAA Wizardry\u201d085 - \u201cI was a Teenage Bigfoot113 - \u201cCurses\u201d 141 - \u201cEven Hand\u201d169 - \u201cBigfoot on Campus\u201d221 - \u201cBombshells\u201d 277 - \u201cCold Case\u201d 325 - \u201cJury Duty\u201d 353 - \u201cDay One\u201d381 - \u201cZoo Day\u201d"}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11855472-steven", "userReview": "Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review.MORE DRESDEN! FINALLY! Okay, so, I'm not going to get into how much Butcher is driving me nuts over here with his newly found George R.R. Martinism. But I will say YAY, because finally more Dresden.Let's be honest here, though... most of these shorties were already released in other anthologies. Only one is new and original to this anthology. But, as someone who doesn't usually purchase many anthologies unless they are author-specific (like this one, or Faith Hunter's Jane Yellowrock anthology, or Patty Briggs' Mercyverse anthology) or they have at least two or three shorties by authors I already know and love... this anthology was a gem. I got all of these other shorties without the expense of buying many more anthologies with things I probably wouldn't love in them. :) And we got a brand new standalone story called Zoo Day.My favorite stories in this collection were the Molly stories, if I'm being honest. She's become a very interesting and easy to relate to character, and it was cool (pun intended!) to see things from her point of view. She's got a lot of challenges ahead of her now, and I think she's going to remain one of my favorite characters in the growing cast.I also really loved the Butters shorty. Seriously, I love Waldo \"POLKA WILL NEVER DIE\" Butters. I love all the nerdy references in his stories.Zoo Day was great... and we got to see some of the story from a VERY cool perspective... MOUSE! I loved it... and loved the quote from a dog's viewpoint: \"That might be the hardest part of human heart-stupidity: how much happiness you simply leave aside so that you have enough time to worry.\" Ain't that the truth? The foo dog speaks truth!I liked being able to read all of the Bigfoot stories as well, and rereading Marcone's shorty Even Hand was fun too.Overall, highly recommended to help tide you over if you are jonesing for a Dresden fix, especially if you are like me haven't read most of these shorties.---Review to come on release date, but initial thoughts:I enjoyed the Bigfoot stories and the random other ones, but the best stories, in my opinion, were the Molly stories, the Butters story, and Zoo Day. :)"}, {"userName": "Carole (Carole's Random Life in Books)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5892196-carole-carole-s-random-life-in-books", "userReview": "This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life in Books.I had a great time with this book. I knew that this was going to be a book that I would need to read as soon as I saw it. I have been a fan of The Dresden Files for quite some time so spending a bit of time with Harry Dresden and company was something that I was quite eager to do. I went into this book with pretty high expectations simply because I have come to expect great things from this series. I am happy to say that this book met every one of those expectations.Of the 12 stories included in this collection, 11 have been previously published. I was lucky enough to have missed all but one of the stories so almost everything was new to me. The one story that I had read previously was one that I really enjoyed the first time so I decided to go ahead and read it again and ended up enjoying it just as much the second time around. I loved how varied and original each of the stories were while giving me the taste of much loved series that I was looking for. Some of the stories feature Harry as the lead character but we do get the chance to see other characters take that role including Molly, Butters, Maggie and Mouse, and Warden Luccio. I loved getting the chance to see these other characters take the lead and enjoyed spending a moment hearing some of their thoughts.When I pick up a collection of stories, I have discovered that I will probably like some of the stories more than others. I usually come across a few that I don't really care for as well but that didn't happen with this book. I really liked all of the stories pretty equally and can honestly say that every story in the group is solid and if rated individually, I would give them all either 4 or 5 stars. I would highly recommend this book to others. These stories take place at various spots within the series but I think readers new to the series would appreciate this book. Fans that are up to date with the series will enjoy seeing favorite characters as we remember them. I can't wait to read more from this amazing series!I received a digital review copy of this book from Berkley Publishing Group via NetGalley.Initial ThoughtsI enjoyed this book of stories. Even though most of the stories in this collection have been previously published, I had only read one of them prior to picking up this book. I liked that there was a short introduction from the author before each story to set everything up. It was great to spend some time with Harry, Molly, Butters, Maggie, and the rest of the gang."}, {"userName": "decafJess", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12498816-decafjess", "userReview": "Me when I found out that a new short stories book was coming out during the downtime before Peace Talks:I'll admit, when I started reading this book I was a bit... miffed. Apprehensive. It's been a long time since I'd been in the Dresdenverse, and I'd been spending a lot of time in other universes. I was impatient for a new book.[Now don't get me wrong -- I understand authors are human beings with lives and other responsibilities and they don't exist solely to entertain me. I have sort of a cognitive dissonance going on where I am 110% patient when it comes to supporting Mr. Butcher as an author who writes on his own time, while I am also mad at Harry for being away for so long.]But the Bigfoot stories got to me and pulled me out of my \"I miss Harry\" funk. The Bigfoot trilogy rose to the top of the collection and showed us the more parental side of Harry. We see this new Harry again in the final story, where a zoo trip with Mouse and Maggie forces all three to face their demons (and some real demons, too.) Side characters are given their time to shine in this anthology. Even Gentleman Marcone gets an opportunity to be a bit heroic. We see Molly twice, one in a heartrending story of loss, and again when she earns that favor from the dark elves and we see how an illusion mage like herself handles combat magic. (Creatively.) Waldo Butters steals the show as the new Knight of the Cross. Considering that he wields a sword that looks more like a lightsaber than a holy relic, it should come as no surprise that his first \"Call\" from the Almighty is quite a bit different from the still, quiet voice that pious Michael had heard.And who could deny the appeal of Anastasia Luccio subduing some bad guys out in the Old West with Wyatt Earp? I suppose you could skip this collection and still read Peace Talks, book 16, when it comes out. But why would you want to? This book is just fun and gives more insight to characters that Mr. Butcher has already fleshed out wonderfully.received via Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5375148-beth", "userReview": "Brief Cases is a collection of what they call \"shorts stories\", but I call them a fantastic way to experience this amazing world in novelette length tellings.

The first one, SIDE JOBS was one I tremendously enjoyed because it was a nice mixture of Harry Dresden stories as well as his supporting cast. I also enjoyed seeing more of the Formor, who are my favorite of Jim Butcher's creations even if they mostly serve as cannon fodder and mooks following the destruction of the Red Court.\tBrief Cases is a very entertaining collection of short stories which include three stories introducing \"Big Foot\" into the world of the Dresden Files, Anastasia Luccio in the Old West, Molly Carpenter versus the Formor, Gentleman Johnny Marcone versus a Formor wizard, Butters' first outing as a Knight of the Cross, and a story where Harry Dresden takes his daughter to the zoo.\tSo, what did I think of Brief Cases? It's good. I actually was a beta-reader for some of the Big Foot stories back when I was still a super-fan of Jim Butcher's work versus writing my own urban fantasy. The Big Foot stories are easily the best in the collection and I kind of think it was a mistake to make three short stories about the premise versus one big novel called BIG SHOES TO FILL. There's certainly enough material to do a book and the characters are interesting enough to keep me interested.\tAs for Harry Dresden becoming a dad like Kratos and other aging characters in genre fiction, I'm glad to see he's making an effort to get to know his daughter. Sadly, Maggie doesn't really make that much of an impression in her initial appearance. She's a brave and adorable little tyke but doesn't have much in the way of personality versus, say, Ivy the Archive. Maybe that will change once she ages up.\tMolly Carpenter is the character who gets the most development after Harry himself. We get to see her doing her best to fight the Formor threat in Chicago as well as forge alliances for the Paranet. I never much cared for Bat-Molly in GHOST STORY but prefer her being mostly the same Goth Girl she was before, just older and more mature. This book runs her through the ringer, though, especially when we discover what being the Winter Lady entails.\tMost of the stories follow the formula of, \"X character meets Y monster, they fight\" so I can't say it's quite as interesting as Side Jobs. I don't think we get as much insight into new characters as we did in that collection. I think Marcone's story remains the most interesting as we really get to see how prepared and dangerous he is for dealing with a supernatural threat like Harry Dresden.\tIn any case, I think the best part of this book is it nicely puts me in the mood for a return of the Dresden Files after the long absence following Harry's adventures in SKIN GAME.8.5/10"}, {"userName": "Jen (That's What I'm Talking About)", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4017411-jen-that-s-what-i-m-talking-about", "userReview": "Brief Cases is a delightful anthology of novellas and shorts all set in the Dresden world. While one could listen/read without having read Dresden previously, I think the stories are more meaningful and entertaining for the fans of the series. The tales take place over a wide-ranging time period, from before Harry\u2019s birth, to events that take place shortly after the conclusion of Skin Game, the most recent full-length story. If you are not up-to-date with your Dresden reading, there are huge spoilers in some of the stories.Generally, the narration is high caliber. Most of the stories, all those told from Dresden\u2019s point-of-view, are performed by James Marsters, and he is the absolute best! It\u2019s been over a year since I last listened to new Dresden titles, and hearing his voice felt like coming home. He is truly amazing, able to portray deep emotion and those inexplicable non-verbal cues that make the difference between reading and performing the work. Most of the other narrators fit their personas and did a solid job. I\u2019ve included comments about each narrator with the story they perform. A FISTFUL OF WARLOCKS (from Straight Outta Tombstone, edited by David Boon), read by Cassandra Campbell Luccio takes on necromancers in the Wild West. Set long before the events of the series.Not my favorite story, but gives backstory on a dangerous nemesis from present day. I liked that part of the story, but wasn\u2019t a fan of the tie-in with Wyatt Earp. The narrator had a lovely Italian accent, fitting of Luccio. But I didn\u2019t really care for her other character voices, and the speed was difficult for me to get just right. Even though it was fast for Luccio, I ended up pushing to 1.5x speed because Earp\u2019s drawl was painfully slow. I didn\u2019t care for his voice... a bit grating. \u2028Story: B- Narration: C+ (B-/C)B IS FOR BIGFOOT (from Under My Hat: Tales from the Cauldron, edited by Jonathan Strahan), read by James Marsters\u00a0Takes place between Turn Coat and Changes.Mr. Butcher adds Bigfoot to his expansive world. Harry is hired by a \u201cforest person\u201d to look in on his half-human son, who seems to be experiencing a supernatural issue at school. Hearing Marsters\u2019 voice was like coming home. My heart lit up, just hearing Harry again. It\u2019s been too long. I missed this. The story was wonderful and typical Harry. \u2028B+/A (Story/Narration)AAAA WIZARDRY (from the Dresden Files RPG), read by James Marsters\u00a0Harry teaches a group of young Wardens his procedure for dealing with supernatural nasties.Harry teaching young wardens with a personal story. It\u2019s pretty good, but six minutes in, the whole direction of the story changed. There was no transition, and it was very confusing. I had to skim forward and re-listen to determine it was the same story. Marsters narration is spot on. B/AI WAS A TEENAGE BIGFOOT (from Blood Lite 3: Aftertaste, edited by Kevin J. Anderson), read by James Marsters\u00a0Takes place circa Dead Beat.We find Harry\u2019s Bigfoot friend in need of help again. I love how this is tied directly to the second short in the anthology.

Told from Marcone\u2019s point of view. Takes place between Turn Coat and Changes.I read this one in the Urban Enemies anthology. (my review: http://twimom227.com/2017/08/review-u...) The author, Jim Butcher, narrates this one, and does a decent job. He knows his characters and brings them to life, but I\u2019m used to (and love) Marsters. B+/BBIGFOOT ON CAMPUS (from Hex Appeal, edited by P. N. Elrod), read by James Marsters\u00a0Takes place between Turn Coat and Changes.This is the third story in the \u201cBigfoot trilogy,\u201d each connected. The story shares some of the harder parts of being Harry. The love story between Bigfoot Irwin and his lady is heart-wrenching. My only issue is that I feel Butcher neglected one of his own rules for his world/characters, and it bugged me. Yet, I enjoyed the story and the closure we got for Irwin. A-/ABOMBSHELLS (from Dangerous Women, edited by George R. R. Martin and Gardner Dozois), read by Julia Whelan Molly teams up with Justine and Andi to thwart a Fomor plot.Takes place between Ghost Story and Cold Days.I love getting to know more about Molly from her own POV; to hear that she\u2019s not the insane lady she\u2019s made out to be in Ghost Story, and to know how hard it is for her without Dresden. I like the narrator selected for Molly. It portrays her youth perfectly. But when I hear Leah, Butters, and Dresden himself... the voices are off because I\u2019m so used to Marsters. A-/B+COLD CASE (from Shadowed Souls, edited by Jim Butcher and Kerrie Hughes), read by Julia Whelan\u00a0In Molly\u2019s first job in her new role, she teams up with Ramirez to take on a Lovecraft-esque cult. Takes place shortly after Cold Days.Same narrator, who continues to do a great job with Molly\u2019s character. This is a moving story: one which shows the highs and lows of Molly\u2019s new life as the Winter Lady. One in which she learns two very difficult lessons. It tore me up a little bit. A-/B+JURY DUTY (from Unbound, edited by Shawn Speakman), read by James Marsters\u00a0Harry endures Jury Duty. Set after Skin Game.Another Dresden story. Yea! It\u2019s an excellent day-in-the-life story, but as with Dresden, everything isn\u2019t as it appears. A-/ADAY ONE (from Unfettered II, edited by Shawn Speakman), read by Oliver Wyman\u00a0 Butters\u2019 first mission. Set after Skin Game.I love the voice for Butters! I had to lower the playback speed to 1.25x, however. All the character voices are good, but Harry isn\u2019t Harry. I like Butters a lot and this story was great; seeing him come into his own as a Knight. A/B+ZOO DAY (original), read by James Marsters\u00a0An exclusive novellette from the perspective of Maggie and Mouse. Set after Skin Game.This is a wonderful story... day in the life... of a trip to the zoo for Harry, Maggie, and Mouse the dog. The story is first shared from Dresden\u2019s POV, followed by Maggie and then Mouse. Marsters does a great job. The story is touching for those who have followed Dresden and the fears he has over raising Maggie and being in her life. We learn about a dark Fu dog, Mouse\u2019s brother, who works for an entity that wants Maggie. A-/AOverall, Brief Cases is a wonderful anthology for Dresden fans, but it\u2019s still not as good as a new book, for which we\u2019re are patiently waiting.OVERALL Ratings:Stories: A-Narration: see individual ratings, above.Review copy provided by Penguin Random House Audio."}, {"userName": "Jacqie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2133111-jacqie", "userReview": "Thanks to Netgalley for providing a copy of this book for review.If you're a fan of Jim Butcher, you'll likely enjoy this book of short stories set in the world of Harry Dresden. Note that they are not all stories about Harry Dresden! Several of them are from the viewpoint of other characters like Molly, Butters, Anastasia Luccio, and Gentleman Johnny Marcone. Each story features an introduction by Jim Butcher that places the story in context and time in the series. These were pretty helpful, and since it's been a long time since I've read the first books it was interesting to see how much has changed. Most of these stories have been published elsewhere, although I think there are at least two new stories included. I'd read many of the stories myself in the past, but again, it had been long enough that I liked reading them again. And it's nice to have them all in one place!If you've never read any Harry Dresden books, I wouldn't recommend opening this book until you've read at least the first two or three in the series, and frankly, you should probably wait until you've read all of the novels or the short stories will spoil you for major events.The biggest treat was that part of one story was from the perspective of Mouse. His explanation for being just a bit pleasingly plump? \" I am a good dog, everyone says so, and that means treats.\""}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13454748-robin", "userReview": "It's Molly Carpenter's first week as the Winter Lady.

He has been sent to help the Miksani. Molly and Carlos soon discover that something strange is going on. Some local fishermen have been possessed by some scary creatures. Molly is hoping this doesn't ruin her first assignment as the Winter Lady.I've been waiting for a new Dresden Files book for over a year. I'm happy we got a little taste of the series while we are waiting for the next book. Harry Dresden doesn't appear in this story, but Molly quotes him several times.

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.I am up-to-date in my\u00a0\n\nDresden Files series\n\n\u00a0reading, so for the first time I could request and review one when released.\u00a0 I totally love this series and all its wonderful characters.\u00a0 I started to read this with excitement a few weeks ago and couldn't seem to get going on the first story.So I began again with trepidation, rather than glee. It still took a moment but then I settled into the story. The first one is about Warden Luccio and I am sure if I had been ensconced in the voice of James Marsters, the two week pause would never have occurred.\u00a0 Also, if the first story had been one about a character more familiar, and this one placed a bit later in the order, I would have been off and running with no end in sight. Once I did get going I read until 4 in the morning and could barely put it down to sleep, finishing the next day.I loved all these stories SO much. It was amazing to hear the backstory in the little forewords to each one. I particularly enjoyed getting so many others point of views, such as Molly, Butters, Maggie and Mouse. I cherished every word, laughing all the way.I own the rest of the series on audio. I love James Marsters' narration.\u00a0 When preparing the review format last month,\u00a0 I added the links to purchase. I went ahead and pre-ordered the audio version for myself. I'll love it many times for many years. I want more of this series and this author, and will\u00a0 treasure each book.\" When people come to the only professional wizard in the Chicago phone book for help, they're one of two things: desperate or very smart.\u00a0 Very rarely are thy both. The smart ones come to me because they know I can help; the desperate ones come because they don't know anyone else who can......My newest client wanted something different, though. He wanted me to meet him in the woods. This did not make me feel optimistic that he would be one of the smart ones.\""}, {"userName": "Under the Covers Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35433419-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "I received this book for free from Publisher in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.BRIEF CASES is another anthology by Jim Butcher that contains various short stories in the Harry Dresden world. If you\u2019re familiar with the SIDE JOBS anthology, this is a bit of the same thing and considered a sequel to it. As this will release before PEACE TALKS, the stories all take place before then and kind of jump around in the series. So some of them will be before the series and some will take place between certain books. It would be nice to know those details beforehand so that you can full understand the timeline in which these stories occur.You\u2019ll also get various POVs, including Molly, which is a favorite of mine, so this compilation really does have a good mix for all you loyal Dresden followers. I think it\u2019s a great way to refresh your memory on some details but probably won\u2019t be the best first experience for readers who are looking to try this series. Since the timelines jump around so much, it can get confusing so it\u2019s best to have read the other books in the series first before jumping into it.

Both series I have read by him are in the top10 favorites of all times. I'm (and the majority of his fans) desperately waiting for Peace Talks but while we are waiting, Brief Cases is here!Brief Cases, just like Side Jobs, is a compilation of short stories in the Harry Dresden World. Most of the short stories have Harry as the protagonist but we also get some of the other very well known players having their own. Molly has two, one before and one after becoming the Winter Lady. Waldo Butters facing his first quest as a knight, Gentleman Johnnie Marcone handling a sticky situation, and even Anastasia Luccio battling evil in the company of Wyatt Earp. Of course, my favorite was the last one. It involves Harry, Maggie, and Mouse spending a day at the zoo. Why was it my favorite? Because we get the same tale told by each of them in their own perspective. Harry being a wizard and having so many enemies is never going to make his parenting easy.Bigfoot also has 3 short stories. Bigfoot asks Harry for help with his scion. The first one, when Irwin was a kid, then as a teenager and the last one, as a young man in college. I enjoyed them all. I hope we get to see Bigfoot and Irwin showing up in any of the books to come and helping Harry when he needs it.\n\"Whenever you've got a choice, do good, kiddo. It isn't always fun or easy, but in the long run it makes your life better.\"\nDon't hesitate to grab Brief Cases if you are a lover of the Harry Dresden files. It's a must!I just have one question.

The world building for this series remains for me one of the best out there and I adore that this compilation had stories from other character POV's, especially Marcone! That was definitely a high point for me!All of these stories were great reads but some definitely stood out for me more than others such as the one mentioned above, and of course more insight into Mouse and Maggie was very well received.The book is presented as fun for established readers of the series, and a great introduction to new readers of the world. This is hard for me to judge, having been ensconced in the series for years, but I feel some of the stories would help with this more than others (for example I feel a new reader may enjoy the 3 bigfoot stories say more than the standalone from Marcone's POV which without background of his character I feel would lose much of the appeal.)That being said this earns a 5 stars from me.

While I was OK with the narrator for the Molly POV stories, the Lucio story was unlistenable for me and I had to skip it. That was also the only one of the previously-published stories I had not read, which is really irritating. I liked the Harry and Mouse scenes in Zoo Day, but not Maggie. Honestly, I don't read the Dresden Files for its female characters - and that includes female children. Likewise, Bombshells is fun - only for the big reveal at the end - but the entire \"women jealous of each other\" makes me roll my eyes. The seriously, the boob conversation was just...ugh. Same with the Molly and Carlos story; I can see that going about three different ways now for Molly and ugh is how they all end up.I preferred Side Jobs more, but honestly that was because it was nearly all Harry stories.

Some I found quite entertaining, others I found a bit, well not quite sure of the point. Not all stories contained Harry, which was quite okay because they gave me a sense of the writer\u2019s style. Each story has a little \u2018warm up\u2019, shall we say, from the other of the purpose or thought of the author that led up to the why of writing each story. That somewhat threw me at first because initially I just thought they were musings of the characters. Over all I enjoyed what I read even getting a few chuckles out here and there. As someone who has long wanted to read The Dresden Files but hasn\u2019t had the opportunity, when this little nugget of short stories came up for grabs, I jumped on it. I\u2019ve seen the TV series but kept holding out on reading the books. Not exactly sure why other than my TBR pile was so big I hadn\u2019t owned any of Jim Butchers books\u2026yet! I found Brief Cases a great introduction for me and has certainly piqued my interest to want to read more about Harry Dresden and this whole world Mr. Butcher has created. My only questioning thought is this: Have I ruined the series by just reading what essentially is a series of samplers for me because I think I would have gotten more out of these stories had I read the series from the very beginning.
