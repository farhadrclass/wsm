The adventure is grand, the world is alive, and the characters are memorable. In the distant future, the earth is little more than barren landscape cluttered with the rusted remnants of crumbling infrastructure. People have raised the cities from the ground, retrofitting them with rolling tracks and steaming engines to prowl the wastes in search of smaller cities to devour for scrap. The mining town saw the danger and turned tail, but already the huge caterpillar tracks under London were starting to roll faster and faster. Soon the city was lumbering in hot pursuit, a moving mountain of metal that rose in seven tiers like the layers of a wedding cake, the lower levels wreathed in engine smoke, the villas of the rich gleaming white on the higher decks, and above it all the cross on top of St. Paul's Cathedral glinting gold, two thousand feet above the ruined earth. Enter fifteen-year-old Tom, Third Class Apprentice to the Guild of Historians, who daydreams of rescuing pretty girls from air pirates. Tom could really use a little adventure in his life. Cue the mysterious girl with a terrible scar running down her face whose chance encounter with Tom leads to far more adventure than he bargained for."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Terrington", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6313408-jonathan-terrington", "userReview": "Third ReviewYou can read this review over at my website as well The Write Stuff and you will also be able to read my review of the film once I watch it in December 2018!The Hungry City Chronicles is one of my favourite book series from childhood. I was around twelve to fourteen years old when I first read the series. The ideal age to read these novels and to be entertained by them. I had no preconceptions about literature structure. No knowledge about in media res or three-act story telling. However, I had some concepts about the quality of a story based on the other material I was reading and had read. Take The Lord of the Rings - my favourite novel of all still today for a variety of reasons. Or maybe consider that I was also consuming Pride and Prejudice, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Little Women and many other classics. And for me, Mortal Engines as an entire series was up on a pedestal.Revisiting the series I can see some obvious flaws in the writing. There is a large amount of obvious foreshadowing, and many of the characters are thinly sketched. In many regards they feel like simple avatars for the expression of the world around them. Yet again, the idea of this novel is certainly bigger than the novel's telling. In a charming way the novel's faults appear whimsical in adulthood, with the world existing as a patchwork of unique science fiction ideas.It is a novel in a future world, in which cities drive along on treads and devour smaller cities. In the process of this 'Municipal Darwinism' cities absorb various resources and items from these other cities. This future world has been devastated by a previous apocalypse, splitting the land into the roaming cities and a few 'Anti-Tractionists.' The Anti-Tractionists believe cities should live on the ground and not move around. It is a world in which the concepts of extremist capitalism are shown on an artistic canvas, warning the reader of the dangers of cities existing in isolationism. The reader is shown that a world in which cities devour one another to maintain some kind of importance on the Earth is no world worth living in.In many ways, the 'cool elements' of this novel that attracted the adolescent version of myself are mere distractions. The scarred heroine, the bookish protagonist, the cyborg zombies, and the moving and eating cities. The real essence of this novel is found in the heart of what it has to share about humanity: our present and our future. And that is what truly touched me and continues to influence me now as an adult re-reader. Second ReviewTime has certainly tempered my approach to this series - particularly to this book - however I remain convinced that this work of fiction remains at a higher calibre of fiction than many others in the same subgenre of YA fiction. My re-read would therefore re-categorise it to closer to 4 or 4.5 stars in the light of the fact that I did not find it as engaging as reading it for the first time, and I hold to the notion that a book must be as fine the second time as it is the first.The novel is an apocalyptic YA fiction work, set far into the future where, as described in my original review: cities roam around as mobile vehicles which chase and 'eat' other cities for resources. The 'historians' on these cities hunt through the wreckage of prey for mysterious Old Tech such as 'seedys' (CDs). However, given that this is set far into the future such other 'Old Tech' exists such as robotically animated zombies called 'stalkers' which are reainimated corpses made for war and energy weapons - most of which has been lost to any semblance of society that remains. The setting is one of the most fascinating parts of this series - and as the series continues this setting develops and you see more fascinating science fiction concepts and greater development of the characters as well. Which is probably what I noticed about this first novel: while charming, the characters were slightly sketchy in terms of their descriptions and emotional construction. That said, as I also recall: the series becomes more emotional and romantic as it continues.All in all, a highly recommended series, possibly best aimed at 13-16 year olds, who are looking for something in a science fiction vein. It's certainly much better written than The Hunger Games and has as interesting or more interesting a world and characters!Original ReviewMortal Engines as a series is a master-class in inventive YA science fiction. There are very few series where I can state that the last novel is my favourite in full honesty. Often I will read a series and the last novel will bring it all to a painful or awkward close. Which is what I am hoping will not happen with The Wheel of Time and the last Obernewtyn book. I do know for a fact that this is not what happened here.The world of Mortal Engines is dominated by Municipal Darwinism. This is the idea used to promote and state that the city-eat-city mentality is acceptable. So, you're saying, city-eat-city, is that a metaphor? Well not in this work of speculative fiction.In Philip Reeve's post-apocalyptic world cities literally eat one another. They move on tractor treads and few people ever touch the ground. Tom, the main protagonist certainly had never touched ground until Hester Shaw knocked him off London. Well she was trying to escape her failed attempt to kill one of London's dignitaries and a kind of zombie robot. And so begins one intriguing and interesting journey for Tom and Hester as they try and stop a plot brewing on London itself.If you enter this series you will find technological discoveries, swords, guns, explosions, fireworks, loads of zombie robot machines and intriguing and zany characters of all racial types and genders. It's a brilliant series and one I would love to have on my bookshelf to own."}, {"userName": "Ivan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31294609-ivan", "userReview": "It's town eat town worldI separate YA dystopian books in two categories based on two popular series. Hunger games it's children and books similar to Chaos walking. Mortal engines is latter.While it's bit older they are definitively branches of the same tree which has roots in old fantasy.Mortal Engines is steampunk dystopia where after huge war ground become unstable and resources become scarce so entire settlements became mobile. Thousand years later and towns still roam and devour each other for slaves and resources. Our protagonist is just poor boy, nobody loves him, who lives in one such city but his lives but after he stops one of towns officials being assassinated by mutilated girl things go badly for him as bunch of city's dirty secrets come to light and soon he finds himself out of town he knew all his life and on dangerous adventure with above mentioned girl in old fantasy style full of interesting places, people and well written banter.Overall 4.4 stars.

Second bad review in the same week, but I have to be honest. I read this book because my boyfriend read it when he was a kid/teen and he said he remembered it as awesome. Well, I guess we look at things differently when we're kids.And yet - I know a lot of kids books that have brilliant writing, good story-building and don't need to be dumbed down.Let me just put it in the form of a nice list. The good:- good morals underneath- nice idea about the way the world works, the hungry cities- the ending did absolve it a little bit- for a YA book, it wasn't overburdened with love triangles or worse (as is usually the case)That would be about it.The bad?- it never gets anywhere until you reach 50%- stuff just happens in a jumble, never leading up to anything for half the book either- stuff is just too damn predictable- the writing is kind of bad- more than half the important characters are killed off at 95%. Seriously? Were you going for some drama here?- it feels unfinished. Or was I reading a first draft? Sure felt like it.There was one more point, and to be honest, I am having trouble figuring out if it should go with the good or the bad things. This would work as a movie. It's written like a movie. But not one of those cinematic books. More like a book that really wanted to be a movie, but couldn't. So it's only half a book.To sum it up, no - it's not a bad book. Maybe not if you're 12. But I still feel that kids' books CAN and should be better than that. You can make it a kids book without writing it poorly.Sometimes I wonder if maybe I should write a book someday too. But then I read something like this and get scared that I'll just write one like that too. Then I think, maybe it's best not to try."}, {"userName": "AH", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3255548-ah", "userReview": "Most awesome book 4.5 stars! \"It\u2019s a town-eat-town world.\u201d \u2013Municipal DarwinismMunicipal Darwinism is a concept that hooked me right from the first page. Imagine a society where hungry cities roam, searching for prey. Imagine these huge cities, shaped like giant steel tiered wedding cakes rumbling around the countryside gobbling up smaller towns and settlements. Imagine the noise, the dust, and the deep tracks in the mud. This is the intriguing world of the  Mortal Engines.This is a world set far into the future. Society has been destroyed by atomics and viruses in the Sixty Minute War. Cities became traction cities because of earthquakes, volcanic activity, and advancing glaciers. This book is full of awesomeness! The author\u2019s attention to details and his story telling talent made this a rich and textured read. The world building was, for lack of a better word, awesome. The technology is interesting. There are elements of steampunk. Everything usable is recycled. Society is even organized in hierarchies, but in this world, everyone is assigned to a guild. There be pirates in this book! There are airships, even an Airship city! There are resurrected men, a type of robot/zombie/Borg-like creature. There is even the mystical town of Shan Gao, a city protected from traction cities by its geography. This book is a feast for the eyes. I adored the main characters. Tom Natsworthy is a young, idealistic third class apprentice in the Guild of Historians. This means that he does a lot of dusting and cleaning of artifacts. He likes his job and is very loyal to the city of London. Tom lost his parents a few years ago in the Great Tilt (which is never explained in the book. I\u2019m assuming the city tilted and some people got squished). Hester Shaw is truly an interesting character. Seven years ago, Hester\u2019s parents were murdered by Valentine. Hester was also attacked and left for dead. Hester is heavily scarred by her ordeal and has vowed to kill Valentine. Valentine\u2019s daughter Katherine plays the role of dutiful daughter until she learns of her father\u2019s nefarious activities. Aided by the engineer Bevis Pod (love that name!), Katherine seeks out the truth. I found these characters endearing and I felt like cheering them on when they encountered obstacles.And these characters encountered many obstacles. Tom and Hester are thrown off the city, captured by pirates, rescued by an airship captain, chased by a resurrected man and more. Added to this mix of adventure was the mysterious MEDUSA, some kind of weapon from an earlier civilization. This is a clever, well written book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I\u2019m looking forward to reading Predator\u2019s Gold, the next book in this series. By the way, I handed my 11 year old this book and he was also hooked - he loves it!"}, {"userName": "Aaron Vincent", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2924544-aaron-vincent", "userReview": "Originally Posted on Guy Gone GeekWith the dystopian boom the market is now seeing, it\u2019s kind of hard to find a true dystopian novel. Strange, isn\u2019t it? There are lots of \u2018dystopian\u2019 novels being published these days but only few of it really fits the genre. Yeah, some books tries but that\u2019s what makes the difference: it tries, it doesn\u2019t just be. Gone was the bleak tone of the narrative. Gone was the relentless nature of the society. Gone was the subtle questions the readers have to ask themselves. What we have instead is a love story that happens to occur in a pseudo-dystopian\u2013 pseudo because it feels completely artificial\u2013 society. It sucks. I\u2019m not saying that a dystopian novel can\u2019t have a love story in it. It can but it doesn\u2019t have to be the element that thrust the narrative forward and it certainly doesn\u2019t have to be the only thing that defines and motivates the heroes. Remember MT Anderson\u2019s Feed? One of the best in this genre, in my opinion. Romance was very prominent in that book but it was never wholly about the romance.Of course, we have different standards as to what books we qualify as dystopian. I am just speaking for myself and I am simply not a fan of the kind of dystopian novels that are being published recently. How do I satisfy my hunger for books that in my standards qualifies as dystopian? I look for titles that were released before the genre became insanely popular. That is exactly how I came across Philip Reeve\u2019s Mortal Engines. I can say that this strategy works because Mortal Engines is an honest-to-goodness dystopian novel. I love it.After a long time of staying idle, the London traction city is back on its wheels, ready to hunt smaller towns. Everyone in the city is excited including Tom Natsworthy, a third-class apprentice in the Guild of Historians. But after saving his hero who is also the city\u2019s darling, Valentine, from an assassination attempt, he found himself thrown off the mobile city with no less that the would-be assassin herself, Hester Shaw. As he spends time with this mysterious and scarred girl and board mobile town after mobile town in hope of chasing his beloved city, he slowly uncover the truth behind the Lord Mayor\u2019s decision to return to the Hunting Ground. Tom has to choose a side and act fast before history repeats itself and the civilization he know meets its doom.One of the most notable things about Mortal Engines is Philip Reeve\u2019s finesse on tying together pacing and world-building, something we don\u2019t get to see too often. The world as we know it almost died after the so-called 60-Minute War, leaving few cities with a poisoned land and scarce resources. In order to survive to this kind of environment, these cities adapted Municipal Darwinism, a system in which they had to build their cities on wheels and hunt one another to get resources. This system resulted to a literal town-eats-town world. Without reading the book, it is rather hard to wrap your head around this idea but the amount of detail Philip Reeve puts into the novel made this idea appear plausible. It felt complete and it made a lot of sense.After reading that paragraph, it would seem that this novel is heavy on world-building. It is not. Trust me, I put down a lot of epic fantasy books already because of its exhausting information dumps just to create a believable world. Mortal Engines is a mile far from those kind of books. There was not a point in the novel when Tom and Hester\u2019s adventure was halted to give way to detailed explanations of how different their world is from us. It\u2019s an exhilirating chase to the breathtaking(and harrowing) finale. You\u2019d be at the edge of your seat every moment of their thrilling adventure.The complexity of the characters are also worth mentioning. As we explore the vast emptiness of the Hunting Ground, we are also introduced to the characters, who they are, what they want and what motivates them. This doesn\u2019t applies only to the lead characters but also the secondary ones, and it\u2019s a pretty big cast, mind you. These characters make the terrible mistakes and pay for it later on. They have unpleasant motivations. They are certainly the kind of people in their history that almost killed earth. These characters are incredibly flawed that makes them incredibly human.Mortal Engines can be enjoyed on so many levels. Philip Reeve is an author that doesn\u2019t compromise. The amount of thought he gave into realizing his imagined world, weaving plot points, creating tension and drawing complex characters makes this novel worth-reading. This is a very gripping and grim story set in a fully-realized dystopian society \u2014 this is exactly how I want my dystopian novels served."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/124962-emily", "userReview": "I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It's has a great concept: mobile cities roam Europe \"eating\" each other. It has a nice, if off-beat, feel for London. On the plus side, the novel actively attacks heroic ideals, leaving a darker, more morally ambiguous world view than I'd expected. I especially liked how Reeve initially juxtaposes the beautiful, \"High London\" girl Kate, who is oblivious to the oppression that keeps her world afloat, with a physically and mentally scarred Hester, who is bent on revenge: rather than use the beauty as a foil to show the inner beauty of the Hester, both are mixed characters and watching their personal growth was one of the most satisfying parts of the book. However, the writing style is a little exposition heavy at times when it comes to the characters feelings and motivations, but becomes less obtrusive as the plot progresses. Some of the plot elements are pretty generic, such as the half-machine, half-resurrected corpse who hunts down the child he once protected (at one point, a character wonders if it's possible for this \"machine\" to have feelings: hmmmm . . . gee, you think so?). The female characters were very well-done, but I agree with several of the other reviews, that the protagonist, Tom, wasn't very interesting. I'm debating about reading the rest of the trilogy now or waiting until later: I'm interested in seeing where Reeve goes with the plot, but not excited enough to pick up the volumes that are literally at my feet right now."}, {"userName": "Wei Cho", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6063515-wei-cho", "userReview": "Dear reader,MAGNIFICENT READ. FAST PACED. EXCITEMENT!!!I don\u2019t have enough words to describe how much I enjoyed this book. The genre, post-apocalyptic steampunk science fiction, has made it into one of my top favourite genres; it totally submerged me intoa new world. Reeve introduces us into a new, strange, colourful, yet gritty world, ruled by \u201cMunicipalDarwinism\u201d (town-eat-town world). His world-building was exceptional, creating an adventurous environment where cities move and \u201ceat\u201d each other to take control of their resources and their people.The story is set into an alternate post-apocalyptic era, where the Earth as we know it was destroyed by the Sixty-minute war. Thereafter, the survivors built cities with claws on wheels to travel the grounds and eat each other. Municipal Darwinism is a version of Darwin\u2019s \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d, but applied to entire moving cities, their resources, and their people.There are people in favour of the moving cities and those who oppose it completely (static settlements). This story weaves idea of imperialism (which city is the most fearsome and powerful), civilization, terrorism, freedom fighting, and environmentalism (with ideals of turning the world green again) and blends them into the plot. The plot is fast-paced and action and adventure oriented; everything happens so fast that you don\u2019t want to miss anything. My mouth dropped several times because of the unexpected and continuous twists.The two main characters are completely opposite to each other, and yet complement each other. In the one hand, Tom Natsworthy, an apprentice historian, has preconceived notions of nobility and what\u2019s right from wrong, and of civility, which shapes his shy, reluctant, and almost cowardly character in the face of danger. On the other hand, Hester Shaw is not the usual beautiful and suffocating sweet girl in order to be likable; she is described as a hideous, blood-thirsty, and strong girl. I dare say she is my favourite character because she is not the damsel in distress; instead, she is cunning, smart, resourceful, and deadly.Through Tom and Hester\u2019s adventure, we get a glimpse of the main elements of the story as they travel together through the Out-Country on foot; evading a Resurrected Man built with ancient technology that is trying to kill them, and rushing to save the world\u2019s largest static settlement, Shan Guo, from its total destruction by a deadly weapon (Medusa), created by the London engineers. A real page turner with airships, quirky gods, and cities moving along barren lands, this is an adventure you wouldn\u2019t want to miss.

It was a strange one for me to read and an even stranger one to review. This story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where the societal norm is for towns and cities to be vertical and mobile. They acquire resources, art and workers by overpowering, or \u201ceating\u201d as they put it, smaller towns. Then there are the \u201canti-tractionists\u201d who live in stationary (ordinary to you and me) towns. These anti-tractionists must go to great lengths to hide and protect their towns from the \u201cMunicipal Darwinism\u201d of their \u201ctown eat town world.\u201dWhere this story didn\u2019t quite work for me was in the telling of it. Phillip Reeves created an amazing world with complex issues and wonderfully flawed characters. Yet the story is told from an omniscient point of view which, combined with the non-stop action, large number of characters and very little internal monologue, left me feeling somewhat distant from the story. Instead of a novel worthy of immersing myself in, Mortal Engines made me long to watch it in a mini-series. Perhaps actors could bring more life to the characters than what Reeves has written? I liked the people he presented, but he only reveals what they are thinking or doing at the exact moment. He never really gives us a chance to know them. And as a result, despite the incredible detail obviously given to this book, the characters tend to fall a little flat. The writing style reminds me of that which is reserved for younger YA, yet Reeves offers difficult topics and this book takes quite a few dark turns that may not be appropriate for younger readers. As I said, this is difficult to review. I loved the book, but wanted a little more depth out of it. Even so, I for sure recommend this for lovers of post-apocalyptic YA, or just any YA fan who needs a break from all of the drama and the angst. Although this is a series, Mortal Engines is easily a standalone book. If you don\u2019t like it, there aren\u2019t any nasty cliff hangers waiting to suck you even further into the series. Really, my review doesn\u2019t do this story any justice. Read Ashley\u2019s review (which I linked above) then go read this book =) I rated this 3 stars, but really 3.5 or even 3.75 ~ yeah, that's nitpicking! The only thing stopping me from rating Mortal Engines 4 stars or higher is the emotional disconect I felt. Oterwise, it's an awesome book!"}, {"userName": "Fiona", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3367789-fiona", "userReview": "James Cameron needn't wait another decade to make his next blockbuster. I have it next to me; or Peter Jackson could make it. I'd rather Tarantino didn't, but you never know. I have the book. The one that children will dress up for, the one that will see as many adult fans as children, the one with three more books to follow, a potential goldmine.\tPhilip Reeve's Mortal Engines is so visually gorgeous that kites flutter from the snowy mountains as you glide above in your airship, oblivious entirely to the reading of words, the turning of pages. A grimy jewel of steampunk artistry, airships and cities floating in the air meet the intensely creepy Guild of Engineers, with their chemically hairless skulls and long white rubber coats. Luckily for such a fantastic, imaginative book, Reeve's narrative voice is so coherent and so subtle that you are allowed to tumble straight into the action of the book. The entirely familiar (we are in the Natural History Museum when the book begins) meets the astonishingly strange \u2013 huge rebel civilizations holed up in the Himalayas. \tReeve is certainly an artist. The two protagonists, one sheltered, na\u00efve and optimistic, one painfully sceptical and streetwise (or earthwise, perhaps), play off the readers' reactions between them. This means you're never allowed to slip out of contact with the narrative. Cleverly interplaying the reader's reactions with those of the characters, Reeve ensures we read just as he would like, anticipating our responses and buffering them with his witty, scared, hearty characters. \tThe book has one of the best opening lines in children's literature: 'It was a dark blustery afternoon in spring, and the city of London was chasing a small mining town across the dried-out bed of the old North Sea'. From that very first line, you are dragged, exhilarated and gasping, across the world. The narrative never slows, even for a moment, pitching the reader into new and dangerous places. Mortal Engines also has the most fantastic concept on its side. The world's cities are scattered and voracious, mounted on huge tracks to cross the wastelands made by the Sixty Minute War millennia before. Remnants from the previous civilisation are greedily hoarded, from CDs (Tom, the almost dislikeable protagonist, gives his 'seedy' away and bitterly regrets it), to mechanical soldiers made from the corpses of men, and, worst of all, atomic weapons.\tIf there is a term I despise, it is 'unputdownable'. No one glued Mortal Engines to my fingers, and I put it down several times, sometimes for whole minutes. There were even hours where I didn't read it, though that was, admittedly, because I was sleeping. In truth this is perhaps the most successfully realised book I have read in a long time. The sensitive, frank narrative voice combines with two superb central characters, Tom and Hester. Tom is a London boy, an apprentice to the Guild of Historians, fiercely loyal to his insatiable city. Hester has lived her life on the ground stripped bare by municipal Darwinism (and if that phrase didn't make you shiver with glee, then you and I must never meet). Hester is ugly, bearing huge facial and emotional scars, an unapproachable, bitter, angry girl, who steadfastly refuses to be a romantic heroine. The two weave their way warily round each other, tentatively finding common ground, awkwardly negotiating. It's engrossing, uncomfortable, exquisite writing.\tDid I mention that this book has to be adapted to film? Reeve has elbowed his way into the competitive world of children's literature by being extraordinarily skilled. The book is hugely visual, and leaves you with a sensation of having witnessed something spectacular. He never falters, his sure, bold voice unrolling the world before us. Like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, or The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, a Mortal Engines film would be an alluring, terrifying world firmly in the steampunk genre.\tI believe it's this 'steampunk' styling that entices so many adult readers. A combination of Victorian technology \u2013 steam power, brass rivets, goggles and a slightly Frankenstein obsession with death and reanimation \u2013 and ridiculous, fantastic invention, steampunk takes over where sci-fi fails. When horrible apocalyptic disasters seem suddenly far more likely (is anyone else playing race the raindrops with climate change versus rogue state?), steampunk assures us that something else is entirely plausible. It proffers technology, made sexy with some cogs and exciting with steam and a bit gothic with some rivets and fire, and says, soothingly, 'here, look, we will survive anything with this and a good dirigible or two'. And it makes it clear we will survive in sexy riding boots, corsets and tan leather coats, which is ideal as far as I'm concerned.\tFor this reason and many others, Mortal Engines is one of very few books I would issue with an adult cover. I liked it so much that I feel a little pitying towards those who haven't already read it. So much, in fact, that in my feverish excitement I appear to have contracted a case of clich\u00e9-itis. I want to say it's a romp. And thrilling. I find the phrase 'if you only read one book...' leaping into my mind, running round my brain as embarrassing and difficult to ignore as a flasher. I want to say that children will love it, which is surely a death knell for all but the best children's books.\tIt really isn't clear whether Reeve was expecting adults to read the book. It is a children's book: you can tell by the way all the parents are cheerfully knocked off as soon as possible, except for the one who turns out to be evil. Of course. There are other predictable elements: the adults they encounter are usually either bumbling, bad and beastly, or rebellious, good, exciting and fun. They are scheming, unreliable and often stupid. There are so many references, though, that I am unsure children will even notice. At one point, the children find themselves on the 'pirate suburb' of Tunbridge Wheels; London's moment comes when it faces the huge conurbation of Panzerstadt-Bayreuth. English is known as 'Anglish', which seems perfectly reasonable when you consider it. \tThe whole conceit of municipal Darwinism, with cities hunting each other down, stripping their victims of their resources, desperately recycling everything (even bodies) between catches, seems a very adult, threatening world. Luckily the magnificence of the whole thing saves it from unrelenting darkness. Reeve lifts the story up, in hot air balloons and airships, letting us see the greater, terrifying, brilliant whole. Perhaps this is where Reeve really slips into brilliance; the book's extraordinary humanity. He teeters over a grim, desperate post-apocalyptic world, and makes it marvellous by peopling it with beautiful, fallible, credible civilisations. Like Pandora in Cameron's realisation of Avatar, it's a world so radiant it leaves you a little sad that it is so far out of reach. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to don my flying goggles."}, {"userName": "Larnacouer  de SH", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24402798-larnacouer-de-sh", "userReview": "Kelimenin tam anlam\u0131yla Y I K I L D I M.Kitapla ilgili deli deh\u015fet fikirlerim, beklentilerim falan yoktu buna ra\u011fmen bitti\u011fi zaman kendimi k\u00f6t\u00fc hissettim, hayal k\u0131r\u0131kl\u0131\u011f\u0131na u\u011fram\u0131\u015f, memnuniyetsiiiiz, surats\u0131\u0131\u0131z, \"O neydi g\u0131z? diye s\u00f6ven; bu nedenle seriye devam etmeyece\u011fim.Kitap i\u00e7in tam olarak karmakar\u0131\u015f\u0131k bir s\u0131\u011fl\u0131k diyebilirim: Net bir tarih vermemekle birlikte, uzak gelecek diye bahsettikleri bir zamanda 60 dakika sava\u015flar\u0131 sonras\u0131nda mahvolan d\u00fcnyan\u0131n Y\u00fcr\u00fcyen Kent'i Londra'day\u0131z.Ve kitap boyunca elimize ge\u00e7en bilgi \u00fc\u00e7 a\u015fa\u011f\u0131 be\u015f yukar\u0131 bu kadar zaten. *Clappinlikeaninsane*Aman bu d\u00fcnyay\u0131 bi' tasvir edeyim, iki betimleme yapay\u0131m gibi kayg\u0131lar\u0131 asla olmam\u0131\u015f yazar a\u011fabeyin belli. *Authorandproud*Mesela, karakterlerden birinin kendisine k\u00f6pek dedi\u011fi bir kurdu var.

One of my favourite books (and series) of all time. I've rated less than 10 books five stars, ever. Less than 10. These are the books I absolutely love; I'm completely blind to their flaws and will sit there and worship them. Mortal Engines is one such book.Reeve writes an astonishing story with a brilliant and engaging plot. The world-building is fantastic: many centuries into the future, where cities are on wheels and wander over the earth eating smaller cities. It's very fast-paced and never disappoints. I was on tenterhooks throughout the entire thing and got so attached to the characters. The characters themselves are works of art, particularly the female ones.Excuse me while I fangirl.So first of all there's Katherine Valentine. She's strong and intelligent, and she won't let herself be pushed around. She's loyal, and she doesn't fall to pieces and lose all common sense at the sight of the love interest. (Yes, there is a love interest, and he's adorable.) She is one of the very few strong female characters in YA literature.Then, there's Hester Shaw. HESTER @\u00a3$%^&*! Shaw. She's the most badass character you will ever meet. She is scarred (physically and metaphorically) and she's developed this hard, cold-blooded exterior to cope with it. No, she isn't one of those sad, 'broken' heroines you see often. Her character development is totally fascinating. She has no scruples and doesn't care about anyone else, and to be honest she's totally horrible. But she's wonderful, absolutely wonderful. And did I mention badass? God, she's amazing. (And her romance is really sweet.) Anyway. Go read this book. Go see why I rated it five stars. Go fall in love like I did."}, {"userName": "Fehiman", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5606199-fehiman", "userReview": "Yorumun asl\u0131 ve devam\u0131 Yorum Cad\u0131s\u0131'nda.Y\u00fcr\u00fcyen Kentler, daha \u00f6nce okumad\u0131\u011f\u0131ma pi\u015fman oldu\u011fum kitaplar kategorisinin ilk s\u0131ralar\u0131nda yer al\u0131yor.

Since I heard about the book before, I went home along with this. Yeepah!Tom Natsworthy is a third-class Historian apprentice of New London, since his parents died and left him with small amount of money that could only support a third class of apprenticeship. Being a Londoner is a pride but being a third-class apprentice is mock. When he meets for the second time his hero, Timothy Valentine and has saved his life. Instead of honoring him, he has got himself out of the running island of London. Hester Shaw is a girl who survived from a massacre. Her parent\u2019s murdered but she remained alive and lives with a scar that reminds her of the reason she lives for. She must take revenge against a man who murdered her family. When she gets her chance to kill the murderer, a boy intervenes. Unexpectedly, the same boy travels with her to hunt down the murderer they both now loath.This book is surprisingly good. I mean really good. Before my main review, I don\u2019t know if this is a dystopia or a steampunk since the book has the two qualities to consider either of them. But I think this is a cross-genre of steampunk and dystopia, if my sources are right that steampunk isn\u2019t just set during Victorian era but any era as long as engines are in it. But if you\u2019re looking for some kind of steampunk of book, I highly recommend this.Back to really good, this book has made my taste. I like the new world. This book shows different world unlike the previous dystopian novels I\u2019ve read. The world sets in the future but bringing with it the Victorian era. If we\u2019ll think of future, technology might be the first thing to come to our mind because it\u2019s pretty obvious that as year passes by, the technology is becoming better and better. And to think of its downfall in the future is really unimaginable. But Reeve made it possible. The present technologies we have as if forgotten in this book that depicts how far the year they are from us. Among the dystopian novels I\u2019ve read, this is the farthest to the possibility of the future. The idea of the book is really cool but where\u2019s the science in a walking city? This is one of the heartbreaking books I\u2019ve read so far. I can\u2019t imagine the loss in the story\u2026 it saddened me a lot. I was hoping for a bright future of the heroes here in the sequel of this series but it distressed me to know that it may not happen anymore. I don\u2019t want to discuss it any further; I may have given the titanic spoiler.Among the characters, I liked Grike. The people who have read this might think I\u2019ve gone nuts. Yes, if it is what it takes for them to believe me. Why Grike? Behind his monstrous features, I admire his heart\u2019s desire. After the squeezing of my brain, I still did not guess what his heart really desires. And now I\u2019m sorry for him.I wasn\u2019t really paying attention in the story that I didn\u2019t notice the biggest twist of the story at the near-end of the book. I didn\u2019t see it coming, but there\u2019s still in me that think that it could have been unnoticeable still. It was as if the turning point of the event\u2014turning point of the character\u2019s interest. Only one thing negative that must be said, I wasn\u2019t contented at how this book ended."}, {"userName": "Diego Dilo", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37530252-diego-dilo", "userReview": "Termin\u00e9 un libro, no lo puedo creer \ud83d\ude02"}, {"userName": "Matti Karjalainen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5721271-matti-karjalainen", "userReview": "Philip Reeven \"K\u00e4velev\u00e4t koneet\" (Karisto, 2004) maalaa lukijansa silmien eteen huikean maailman, jossa yhden tunnin sota on tuhonnut sivilisaation sellaisena kuin me sen tunnemme ja ihmiskunta el\u00e4\u00e4 h\u00f6yryvoiman liikuttamissa kaupungeissa.

The problem with that should be immediately obvious: sooner or later there will be no other cities to consume. And that's the central conflict here, how and whether London will continue as a moving city.There's also fantastic viewpoint characters: Tom, who gets knocked off the city and learns to understand it better on the ground, and Kate, who is determined to learn the truth about her father and finds more than she intended.
