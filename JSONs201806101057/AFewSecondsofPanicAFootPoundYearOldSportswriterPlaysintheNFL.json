I think it was when I was in elementary school.Even though I can't claim a team or quote stats, I was fascinated by this book. The biggest takeaway was this: Professional football players are just people.. They're great athletes, but have insecure jobs and tons of stress. Fatsis's title, \"A Few Seconds of Panic,\" can be applied to the entire cadre of pro ballers, as long as it's changed to \"A Lifetime of Panic.\" Fatsis is a great writer, an even better reporter, and a really innovative researcher. His book is a insider's scoop to the NFL. Few others have been or will be able to create anything similar."}, {"userName": "Ryann Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/852481-ryann-murphy", "userReview": "Since I rarely read nonfiction books, when I do I expect them to be real winners just like this true story of a 43-year-old sportswriter who decides to experience the life of an NFL football player by going through Broncos training camp as a field goal kicker. Not only was it the story of one man's attempt to be a professional athlete, it was also an inside look at the players and management of professional football.Just like when I read a book that was a year in the life of the Professional Bull Riding Association - I was tempted throughout the book to Google the various players to find out how they were doing today. Many of the players Fatsis encounters are trying to overcome the odds to secure one spot on the team's final roster. Along with the physical toll the game takes on the players' bodies, the mental games that are played by coaches and team owners is depicted. Not only do I have a different view of professional football players -I also wonder what I could do if I showed the determination of Fatsis. Professional bowling, maybe? Well, I probably should just aim for a consistent 200 game. That would be amazing enough."}, {"userName": "Jennelle Zarn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68665734-jennelle-zarn", "userReview": "I read Stefan Fatsis's \"Word Freak\" a few years ago and enjoyed it, and I'm a casual football fan, so when I saw this at the library, I thought it might be a good read. I was right. In addition to the interesting inside look at the running of a football team, I also got a humbling reminder that football players are human. They get frustrated with their bosses and with the repetition of the daily grind, just like we all do. They struggle with the capriciousness of the NFL when it comes to their employment. Most surprisingly, I discovered that they're not all spoiled millionaires; many of the \"unknowns\" earn only a couple hundred thousand dollars a year, and the ones who bounce from practice squad to practice squad sometimes earn less than they could make flipping burgers at McDonald's.Even if you don't know the first thing about American football, read it for the universal stories of chasing dreams and of realizing that sometimes hard work and perseverance *doesn't* mean you get the prize."}, {"userName": "Tung", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/763514-tung", "userReview": "Fatsis is a professional writer and journalist whose first book Word Freak (a documentary about the subculture of competitive Scrabble, professional Scrabble players, and Fatsis\u2019 attempt at succeeding at competitive Scrabble) I enjoyed. A Few Seconds of Panic follows the Word Freak mold: put yourself in the shoes of the people you are covering in order to better understand their mindset and their world. Fatsis joins the Denver Broncos in 2006 as a kicker and spends preseason camp and training camp learning the ins and outs of kicking field goals, and in the process gives us a first-hand account of what life is like as a marginal NFL-player. Fatsis succeeds in his endeavor, as I found the book very engaging and informative. From the idea of the book (inspired by Plimpton\u2019s Paper Lion) to initial efforts to learn the basics (hiring a local professional kicking instructor) to training camp to leaving the team right before the start of the real season, Fatsis was able to draw me into his personal journey. He fills the book with character profiles of both the famous (Jake Plummer) to the anonymous (practice squad players and fourth-string kickers). He does a sound job of conveying the harsh reality of an NFL training camp \u2013 both the physical demands and the mental demands (the stress of competing with others for a job, the fear of being cut, the way NFL coaches and front office personnel make the players feel like disposable widgets, etc). Fatsis draws the reader in so well that during one scene where he is asked to kick a field goal in front of the whole Broncos team, I was personally invested in whether or not he was going to make the field goal. In Word Freak, I felt like he put himself too much as the central figure of the book; in A Few Seconds of Panic, that isn\u2019t so much as true \u2013 football as a game and as a business is clearly the central figure. Great balance in his writing, a good mix of both personal insight and objective observation, and engaging writing \u2013 everything you want in a non-fiction read. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50961138-william", "userReview": "Like almost all books about journalists inserting themselves into situations, the author isn't nearly as interesting as the people who surround them. Did I care about Stefan Fatsis's personal journey to be a kicker? Not really (aside from his battle with the NFL to let him kick in a game). I'm not a forty year old dad with two knee surgeries, though. However, I found his portraits of the players to be very illuminating. It became clear that when we watch games as fans, we basically have no idea what's happening outside of a basic surface appreciation. Then we blame the players or the coaches, pretending that we are the experts. Some players were meatheads, others were brilliant, others were headcases, etc. At the end of the day, they were all very human. There is a line in the book from the player who says that football is a really shitty job that pays really well. I think that's my new favorite description of it.It's weird to read about Jay Cutler being the next big thing because in the year 2016 we all know he sucks."}, {"userName": "Dkmoorhead", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2518530-dkmoorhead", "userReview": "Stefan Fatsis is a good writer, a better journalist, and possesses an uncanny self-awareness. That's what makes this something better than a facile, glib piece of participatory journalism. He's aware of his own place in the narrative, and comments on it freely, which nicely puts into perspective his biases and point of view.Of course, he's also incredibly lucky. To get access to a team...any team, like he gets, and to have the cast of characters he does, and to have them (for the most part) be completely honest with him, is almost unfathomable. Also of note is the arcana of kicking a football, something that even die-hard football fans fail to appreciate, which is covered extensively. It's fascinating stuff.

I spent countless hours studying its pages. Lacking a tee, I used one of my mother's plastic measuring cups to set up game winning kicks in the back yard with my battered green Nerf football. Good times. Fortysomething sportswriter and author Stephan Fatsis makes the fantasy come true in \"A Few Seconds of Panic\" and kicks alongside Jason Elam during a Denver Broncos' training camp, emulating George Plimpton who first embedded himself as their \"last string quarterback\" with the Detroit Lions in 1962 and wrote about it in the classic \"Paper Lion.\"I reviewed Paper Lion, which was enjoyable largely because of its novelty and humor. Plimpton was the first journalist to embed himself with an NFL team, and his self-deprecating humor shone through. Also, Plimpton had the incomparable Alex Karras and his hysterical stories for material. More than 40 years have passed and sportswriter Stefan Fatsis is the first since Plimpton to go behind the scenes and document the NFL of today as a player. Much has changed.Football is supposed to be fun, but the NFL of today comes across largely as a grim business. As a Denver Bronco, Fatsis encounters firsthand the adversarial relationship between players and management. The 1990's brought free agency to the NFL, which benefited players financially by enabling them to switch teams, selling their talents to the highest bidder. An NFL career is short, and players scramble to make as much money as they can in their few top earning years as a professional athlete. As Fatsis points out, the problem lies in the fact that since \"players were less loyal to teams, so teams were less loyal to players.\" The result has been that players are loyal only to the team who pays them the most, and teams use players like meat, often using them only to secure a win (or to motivate other players to win by threatening the starters' jobs) and ruthlessly discarding them when no longer needed.Fatsis learning to kick is fun, and it is interesting meeting the players in the locker room and getting to know them. We see firsthand the cold ruthlessness of Mike Shanahan. Chad Mustard is a great Scrabble player (a fact which Fatsis uses to plug his book on competitive Scrabble, Word Freak). We watch as punter Todd Sauerbrun intimidates his competition in training camp and becomes a cancer in the locker room. All-time great kicker Jason Elam talks about his hunting exploits and Christian mission work. We also see how the tragic murder of cornerback Darrent Williams mere hours after the last game of the season effects the team. Far from passionate collegiate athletes, most of the pros presented here are just doing a job, trying to provide for their families, and trying not to get hurt in the process.The \"everyman\" angle in this book is fun up to a point, but it seems a bit self-serving after a while. The book also highlights a problem with participatory journalism. As a journalist, Fatsis is hesitant to bite the hand that feeds him. One of the biggest problems faced by the NFL today involves reported rampant drug use. The author broaches the subject only briefly, limiting his observations to Todd Sauerbrun's 4 game suspension for ephedra use.The book feels light. Fatsis doesn't dig too deeply, and as a result it seems that he is not giving us the full story on the team that allowed him this rare access."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4779298-john", "userReview": "I'd had this in my reading list for a while, and honestly dove into it only because it seemed to be of modest length, and it's currently football season. I remember hearing the book review on NPR a long time ago when the book was released and thinking, \"Oh, he's just cribbing from Plimpton!\" I was pleasantly surprised and engaged at Fatsis' narrative of his quixotic attempt to mold himself into something approaching an NFL kicker. Fatsis sucks you in with his candid, eye-opening picture of an NFL locker room and its players. After a short time, by suffering alongside the players with two-a-days, rigid dawn to dusk schedules, and the constant physical demands, Fatsis managed to blend in with all the other eager rookies and hired hands trying to win a spot on the roster in camp. Moreover, he earned the respect of many veterans on the team. As he says in an epiphinous moment, he became a Bronco - not just some journalist hanging out in the locker room. Through his own determination (and the cooperation of the Broncos coaching staff), Fatsis not only gives you a terrific look at the inner workings of a modern NFL franchise, but what it is like to be (or aspire to be) a real NFL player. Plenty of books can detail the lives of NFL superstars, but I found it far more fascinating to see how life played out for the largely anonymous rookies and journeymen who found their way into Broncos training camp. All those who are prone to over-glamorizing the sport would do well to read this book and find out just how the vast majority of NFL players are treated - like disposable, de-humanized cogs to be plugged in and out (and in and out and in and out again) as the situation dictates. At times it seemed like I was peering at the inner workings of management in a Chinese garment factory instead of a modern American multi-million dollar entertainment business.But not all the book is swept up such documentation and analysis - quite a lot of it (and some of the most engaging bits) deal with Fatsis' personal struggle to train, to learn his small bit of the offense, to force his middle-aged body to put up with the rigors of an NFL training camp. He successfully draws you in so well that you cheer at his few triumphs and wince at the all too often failings as camp wears on into the pre-season. The mental toughness that he develops is interesting. His quest reveals well how many players are physically gifted enough to play in the NFL, but few have the smarts and mental toughness to really make it long-term. And, as a player informs him after he spectacularly fails a kick under pressure with the whole team watching, \"Now you really know what it is like to play in the NFL.\" We're all too often judged or remembered more for our failures instead of our successes. Or, as Jason Elam puts it, \"you're only as good as your last kick.\" Fatsis' sometimes funny, sometimes ironic, but always honest exploration of his own desires to play, alongside that of his teammates are some of the best parts of the book. I had expected to be a little jaded with the sports psychology bits, but they were quite thought provoking.All in all, this is a great read. Recommended for sports fans and non sports fans alike."}, {"userName": "Paul Schulzetenberg", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/287335-paul-schulzetenberg", "userReview": "Fantastic. Fatsis has managed to do what few writers accomplish. He has combined significant analysis of the culture of football with an account of an interesting sports story. Even the most mouth-breathing of football fans will find something to bring them closer to their athlete heroes in this book, and will really be rooting for Fatsis with every kick he takes in practice. If you are interested in something more than a feel-good story, it gets even better. Fatsis explores the norms, culture, marketing, and even social criticism of football with a journalistic eye that is painfully absent in most sports media. Fatsis establishes early that his loyalties lie with the players, in contrast to his rather cold feelings for the NFL and the system it perpetrates. He describes unflinchingly the firings and life-altering debilitations of football, which we fans sanitize by calling cuts and injuries. Fatsis repeatedly brings home the point that these athletes are people, and people who are constantly fighting for their job. Job security doesn't exist in the NFL for any but a very few players, a point which is most strongly enforced in the epilogue, as we go through a laundry list of the players discussed in the book, and note that in two short years from the events of the book to the publication, many of the players are out of football, and those that remain are mostly on different teams. In other words, most of them have changed occupations or employers, and very few of these cases were voluntary.I read this book only a short two weeks after finishing George Plimpton's Paper Lion and comparisons are inevitable. Fatsis himself titles one of his chapters \"I'm no George Plimpton.\" However, Fatsis' self-deprecation does him a disservice. Fatsis has penned a book every bit as revealing and easy to read as his predecessor, and has even outstripped Plimpton in relevance and journalism. Plimpton brought an earnest and eager naievete to the game, and his writing often reflected his lack of football knowledge. Fatsis, on the other hand, is coolly reflective throughout, and although he takes time to make sure the reader can understand the terminology used, he also is candid and able to use his knowledge to provide a deeper look into the game, and one that is ultimately more satisfying.This is a must-read for anybody who complains about player salaries or refers to NFL players as \"dumb jocks.\" They will be given a dose of cold realism. Similarly, it's also a must-read for serious football fans who have an interest in the inner workings of the sport."}, {"userName": "Malin Friess", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1400585-malin-friess", "userReview": "(This review was originally posted to the wrong book)I had a good friend who was a sports fanatic. His biggest dream was to rub shoulders with professionals players in the locker room and see what they were like. Incidentally this friend became a sports writer for a small newspaper (Deseret News) and was given all access pass to courtside and the locker room of the Utah Jazz. At first this friend told me he was entranced by these superstar athletes; their size, athleticism, persona. But then after he heard the foul language (Not Stockton or Malone), the crude jokes, the disregard for women, the trash talking...amazement for his previous heroes was lost..as well as perhaps some of the sports writers innocence.  Steven Fatsis a 5 foot 8 inch 170 pound Greek writer (Word Freak) convinces the Denver Broncos to allow him to try out for Field Goal Kicker and be part of the team (not just a reporter) through 2 a days and the preseason. He is given a locker, jersey #9, and plenty of hazing (one for his size, two for his position, and three because he caries a notepad to record every moment).  At times I felt like Fatsis was like my friend who was first overwhelmed by these sports celebrities..soon to find out many were lazy, selfish, greedy, crude, etc. Why read about these athletes that make millions..while many struggle to pay for their kids at 95 dollars a pop to get in to see one Broncos Game..(this was well before Tim Tebow)...think Jake the Snake Plummer days at Quarterback. The interesting thing about the NFL is the frequency that players get cut...the average NFL player lasts 3 years. Many don't enjoy football anymore (would you really enjoy being an NFL offensive Lineman)..but it pays the bills..and their bodies may only last 5 years until their knees give out. They are pragmatic..and see it as a business. At times I felt compassion for these players who wanted a good life for their families..and just a few years in the league before they cut. I had never saw this side of the NFL (we mostly hear about the Terrell Owens, and Peyton Mannings). I give this book 4 stars..not 5 stars. Word Freak (about competitive scrabble players) gets 5 stars. In the end I find world champion scrabble players who memorize dictionaries and can score 600 points in one game more fascinating than NFL athletes. By the end of the book Fatsis could kick a 45 yard field goal and was signing a few autographs for ball boys."}, {"userName": "Yune", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune", "userReview": "I think the subtitle says most of it; the author, who previously entered the world of competitive Scrabble to see what drove other people to it and made it to expert-level, talks his way onto an actual NFL team (the Denver Broncos) as a kicker with an actual number and locker, despite his age and lack of brawn.The book's more nuanced than I expected. Fatsis begins with the odyssey of how he finagled the position in the first place, and takes thoughtful portraits of men who are known better for the physicality than their varied backgrounds, for their fame and fortune and over-the-top follies than their daily frustrations. There are far more people who dream of joining the NFL -- and who are, in fact, qualified -- than there are openings, and despite what you'd think should be a cutthroat atmosphere, these men also band together in gruff camaraderie, knowing that they face similar obstacles, and that they have to depend on each other as a team in order to make their way toward the grail of the Super Bowl.Fatsis undergoes training to glean at least some bare skills as a kicker (he played some soccer earlier in life), but it seems like it's really his mental game that wins him acceptance in the locker room. Unlike most sports journalists, he's willing to live through the pain and commit to months of training camp to really understand what players go through. He faces a humbling kick attempt that sticks the team with extra practice time, and realizes how much more pressure these men face with crowds of thousands and televised games, complete with scathing commentary.He interviews the coach, Mike Shanahan, for his insights into the players; discusses how the financial rules of the league impact player selection; describes the grueling weight-room regimen; faces down potential injuries; suffers the constant observation and judgment; has crude jokes and turnabout comments written in his notebook when he hands it off to another player to hold while he kicks. He has the gift of being able to offer a clear picture of another world and lifestyle while maintaining a gentle self-awareness that keeps him from being swept into it.I don't think I can recommend this to anyone who's utterly devoid of interest in professional football, but if you do want to get an inside picture of an organization that seems to have as much bluster as substance, this is a great look."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37899-tom", "userReview": "This was a fascinating look at a life in professional football training camps. Through the eyes of a walk-on place kicker with no chance of displacing the incumbent, it gives a great window into the day to day reality, drudgery, and physical pain that the athletes endure. More interesting than the physical pain is the mental uncertainty of jobs that require constant production and the very tenuous grasp that many players have. Much of this is due to the very employer friendly, and employee unfriendly, nature of un-guaranteed player contracts. Given the circumstances it in interesting how clear eyed most players treat their time in the league, knowing the physical tolls it will take and how easily it can cease. The attitude of players towards the sport and the media circus surrounding it was one of the most fascinating aspects of the book. Some still love the game, which is why they still play, others feel almost an obligation to display their talents, and others hate the game but can't turn down the potential pay and accolades that come with professional football. The candor Stefan Fatsis gets out of the players and coaches is remarkable. Some players, like quarterback Jake Plummer, were really fascinating, and one of the players, Nate Jackson, even went on to author some books of his own which seem sort of interesting. He really embedded with the team, and seems to have won people over with his effort. All told, this book gave me a greater appreciation of the craft that these athletes practice, and a further diminished view of football in general, particularly professional football. Being born into Cleveland Browns fandom, this diminished interest in the sport may be due to the ineptitude of my personal rooting interests. Training camp is far from glamorous, as the oft repeated axiom of \"players being paid for Monday through Saturday and playing Sunday for free\" reflects. Overall, this book reinforced my preferences towards sports like basketball, soccer, and tennis."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3127817-erin", "userReview": "I picked this up because I'm a big college and pro football fan and also a big lover of memoirs. I thought I couldn't go wrong, and I couldn't pass up the chance to get an inside glimpse of what it's really like to be an NFL player--not just the top-name players like Peyton Manning and Tom Brady, but a nameless lineman who works hard and gets beat up week in and week out. I have to say this book didn't live up to my (perhaps too high) expectations. The author, Stefan Fatsis, gets in shape to be a placekicker and convinces the NFL and the Denver Broncos to let him be part of the team for training camp, although the NFL won't let him kick in a (meaningless) pre-season game. The story is a hybrid of his personal story--40+yr old man fulfills dream of playing in NFL--and a look into the culture of the NFL and its teams. I found the tone almost too earnest as Fatsis struggles at times with his own personal limitations, even though it's a microcosm of the struggle that all players have to stay healthy, play through pain, and perform at the top of their game all the time. Perhaps I didn't like it because it left me disillusioned about the NFL. I knew going into the book that it is a business, but the way the players are treated is demeaning to them both as people and as athletes. Perhaps one of the Broncos players put it best, when he said (paraphrasing) that in college, the coaches tried to build up the players and make them the best players they could be, while in the NFL the coaches just suck the players dry. I can't help but think that Jake Plummer (former QB for the Broncos) made the smartest decision by retiring when they traded him to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and having nothing more to do with football. He has other things in life he wants to accomplish. The players who can keep that perspective end up doing ok, but the ones who have nothing other than football to fall back on are in tough shape mentally as they deteriorate physically. The average pro career is over by age 27 or 28.

Stefan Fatsis decides he wants to go behind the scenes in the NFL and document his experience. The first thing he has to do is find a team willing to indulge him, and he's surprised when Mike Shanahan and the Denver Broncos agree to let him come to camp as a kicker. The book describes the training the author put himself through on his own time to make himself a credible placekicker, and then his time in training camp with the Broncos during the summer of 2006.He talks about his own personal triumphs and embarrassments as he attempts to master the skill. At one point, Shanahan offered to modify the team's practice schedule if Fatsis could connect on a field goal - with the entire team watching. He aptly describes the pressure of being on the spot and of course concludes that being an NFL kicker is not as easy as it looks on TV.He also describes his interactions with his Bronco teammates, including the incumbent Broncos kicker, Jason Elam, and many other lesser-known figures who are just fighting for a roster spot.I found the book to be a pretty good eye-opener as far as the nature of the NFL players. Most players aren't superstars, and many view it as what it is - a really well-paying job. Not all of them necessarily love everything about the game, and many of them resent the coaches and management. But because they are blessed with the skills to play at the professional level, they work hard to succeed.I didn't necessarily appreciate the author's need to spell out every f-word uttered by a player and then add a few of his own in the commentary. Okay, we get it, I don't think anyone was under the impression that NFL players use clean language.As a fan of the Denver Broncos, I enjoyed the peek behind the curtain of the 2006 season, the year Jake Plummer was replaced as starting quarterback by a young rookie named Jay Cutler.

Now he is trying to be a player in the National Football League. In A Few Seconds of Panic, Fatsis sets out to be an active participant in a National Football League training camp. Given his physical size, athletic prowess and reconstructed knee, he sees the role of kicker as one that may work for him. Fatsis quotes Jason Elam, the Denver Broncos incumbent kicker during that training camp, describing the role of kicker as \"hours and hours of boredom surrounded by a few seconds of panic.\" The book is far from boring. If you enjoyed Wordfreak, Fatsis' book on Scrabble, you will also enjoy this book. Even if you are not a football fan. When Fatsis is not competing at Scrabble or football, Fatsis is a sports writer for the Wall Street Journal.Fatsis convinces the National Football League to let him join a team in training camp as long as he can find a team willing to let him in. This is not an easy task in the very controlling NFL. He finally convinces the Denver Broncos to let him participate in training camp. Fatsis participates in training camp and even suits up for a pre-season game against the Detroit Lions. Although the NFL refuses to allow him to participate in the game.Fatsis tries to make some comparisons between football and Scrabble: Both great football players and great Scrabble players say that when they're in the proverbial zone, the game decelerates and the instantly see the answer. I, for one, think that's easier to accomplish without the continual threat of being steamrolled by a charging goliath, which is not a major concern in Scrabble.A Few Seconds of Panic is full of insight to the psyche of a football and football players. It is a great exploration of the psychology of competitive athletes."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58181332-simon", "userReview": "Enjoyed this. Likeable sports journo Stefan Fatsis spent a summer as a kicker at the Denver Broncos training camp and got suprisingly close to the players and management, and this is his account. A couple of things in particular struck me. Firstly, just how short and insecure the typical NFL playing career is - about 3.5 seasons on average- with most players never making the truly big money and many facing severe orthopaedic problems and therefore big medical bills in later life as a result of the incredible punishment their bodies take in every game. Fatsis also recounts a couple of eye-opening examples of players cut during camp working in Subway and driving forklifts in order to pay the bills. It would seem that in the NFL, perhaps more than in any other sports league, the player is just an expendable commodity.The second thing that struck me is what a bizarre way to make a living it is being a kicker. There\u2019s absolutely no scope for flair or ingenuity or creativity or improvisation, the characteristics that you associate with the truly great sportsmen and that sports fans find exciting. Instead, it\u2019s just the near-mindless repetition of one very specific skill (the top kickers clearly have an ability to achieve a level of focus so intense that \u2018mindless\u2019 seems about right). That\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t an incredibly difficult job or extremely important in terms of winning football games, just that it\u2019s not particularly interesting, and therefore not altogether surprising that kickers are under-represented in the Hall of Fame. And, to be honest, if you\u2019ve ever seen Jonny Wilkinson or Dan Carter kick high-pressure penalties or drop-goals in international rugby union games having just spent the preceding 79 minutes being repeatedly pummelled by 260lb forwards, it\u2019s also not that impressive either."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/751680-david", "userReview": "Really enjoyed this chronicle of the writer's training camp with the Denver Broncos as a place kicker. It's explicitly a follow-up to George Plimpton's Paper Lion experiment of an earlier generation.The Broncos coach at the time was current Redskins' coach Mike Shanahan, but with that exception I had no particular interest in any of the individual players or the team. It's recent enough that I've heard of lots of them and knew they were a good but not terrific team. Since it's preseason, though, the actual events aren't that crucial anyway. It's more the personalities, the insider view of what practice routines are like, and the 2 steps forward, one step back process of training and trying to perfect one difficult motor skill (kicking field goals) under tremendous external and internal pressure.Author does a great job of conveying the meaning behind \"it's a business\", \"training camp is a grind\", \"roster cuts are a numbers game\" and associated cliches. I was struck especially by how many of the players he describes don't even really enjoy football anymore by the time they've been pros for a few years. Reminded me of talking to a college swimmer once, who sed she'd always loved her event until getting a college scholarship to do it, at which point it became a grind and a job. The players still knew this guy was a writer, and nothing is revealed here that would really shock anyone (unless you were unaware that some of them drink a lot, smoke grass in the offseason, or curse), but it's still quite a different perspective on the league and the game than you get from daily journalism. He's tremendously respectful of their physical skills, work ethic, and ability to master complex information about game plans and the like, without being fawning. Excellent read."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/159583-kathleen", "userReview": "Stefan Fatsis is a great non-fiction writer. Any more, I don't seem to read a lot of books that aren't related to my job; thankfully it's my job to read hundreds of fantastic YA books, but the point is that I don't so often find myself reaching for adult non-fiction like this. I'm glad I broke pattern for this book. As a regular contributor to NPR, Fatsis already has my loyalty in some ways but also gives me high expectations for his writing, and knowing that he's a Scrabble champ raises the bar (I'm a terrible Scrabble player!). With this book, he's met and surpassed my expectations. I never thought that I would find an inside scoop on the NFL (or the \"No Fun League\") so much fun! The sheer quantity of information the average player must absorb, coupled with the arduous and dangerous nature of the game, leaves me believing that each of these guys could be Superman, if he wanted. Of course, there are some players who are just not nice guys, which Fatsis has balanced out by showing some very admirable people--a QB who has given millions to charity, or a kicker who's also a pilot, divinity student, and all-round nice and supportive guy. It's insane! The language can get pretty rough; Fatsis relates the on-field exchanges (or diatribes) just as they happen, with a lot of things to make a mama cry. So don't offer this to a really young reader, or to someone sensitive to offensive (or defensive?) language. But if you know a good reader who would love a thinking man's take on the tough world of the gridiron, you might want to take a chance on this."}, {"userName": "Ryan Mishap", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap", "userReview": "Another foray in my attempts to understand why spectator sports are such a large part of modern life here in the U.S. Fatsis didn't want to just be a spectator, though, but to follow in the footsteps of George plimpton and actually play for an NFL team, at least through training camp. The Denver Broncos gave him his wish. I got this book mainly because of what lefty sportswriter David Zirin said about it: about how the players are desperate for healthy human interactions in the face of a dehumanizing institution. Well, I didn't really find that in the players Fatsis encountered, but he covers the brutal competition for spots (1,800 NFL spots and 12,500 graduating college fottball players a year), the damage the game causes the body (average NFL career--3-4 years; playing in the NFL shortens a life by ten years on average), the cold calculations of the coaching staff who can't regard the players as people, and the fears of players on the bubble. While he attempts to elicit the thoughts of the players around him, Fatsis also truly works to become a field goal kicker and hopes to be a part of the team, not just an embedded reporter. I liked the author and the look behind the facade of the PR of the biggest sport in the U.S. was fairly interesting. Ultimately, though, football doesn't matter and the majority of the people who play it are just like they were in high school: sexist, anti-gay, arrogant macho jocks. I was hoping, following Zirin's comments on the book, that I would find this wasn't true, but, alas."}, {"userName": "Mark Schlatter", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3088726-mark-schlatter", "userReview": "A really cool book. Although I don't watch the NFL anymore, I still like reading about it. This is Fatsis's story of convincing an NFL team to let a sportswriter play with the team during minicamps and training camp (much like George Plimpton's Paper Lion: Confessions of a Last-String Quarterback). In this case, Fatsis trains as a kicker with the 2006 Denver Broncos. What works best about the account is that the professional athletes grow to trust Fatsis because he suffers with them --- it's a very empathetic look at the typical NFL player. You see the players who move from team to team, trying to hit it big. You see the men who treat the entire enterprise as a business (and themselves as the cogs), and you see the men who love the game. Because Fatsis worked as a kicker, you get a lot of kicker culture (and a lot of goofing off during some practices), so I didn't see as much focus on the regular offense and defense as I wanted. However, I loved Fatsis's descriptions of the pressures of kicking, including the challenges during camp. (A few times, Coach Shanahan tells the team they get thirty minutes off meetings if Fatsis makes a kick.) If you like the NFL or are interested in an hype-free look at professional athletes, this is a great choice."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1392317-michael", "userReview": "This is something like a remake of a movie - Fatsis decided that George Plimpton's idea to participate in a professional football training camp and write up the experience was such a good idea that he would update it. Like Plimpton, he had a fair amount of trouble finding a team that would agree, but eventually he spent all of training camp and most of the pre-season with the Denver Broncos, as a (pretend) aspiring place kicker.For some reason I find place kickers interesting, so this helped with enjoying the book - he talks about the other position players but there's quite a bit about kickers and punters - probably more than many folks want to know.I enjoyed the first 200 or so pages but then it started to drag - once he is no longer with the team but just dropping in for visits, it isn't nearly as interesting and the lengthy epilogue on the Broncos generally and specific players is almost entirely depressing to greater and lesser degrees. Not sure what he could have done to correct that other than leaving about 100 pages of the book out. Anyway, I plowed through the last quarter of the book but without as much pleasure. (I kept looking at the thickness of the remaining pages and thinking, OK what else can he possible say??)Four or five starts for the first two thirds and two or three for the last third."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1354383-angela", "userReview": "This was supposed to be the book that got me through the sad, sad months that the NFL isn't playing. And it did, in a way, as it took me nearly the ENTIRE off-season to get through this memoir.Fatsis is talented writer, and he took his task to heart. He wanted to show life from the inside of the NFL, and he accomplished exactly that. This is quite a feat, considering his newspaper background might have gotten his toe in the door, but was more likely to hurt his relationship with his would-be teammates. But for all that I respect his accomplishment, I just couldn't get into this book. Did my own team allegiances (go Colts!) get in the way? Perhaps a bit. I'll admit that I may have been more intrigued had he been chatting with the Colts d-line or listening to Coach Dungy speak. What can I say? I suspect this book will have an even greater appeal to Broncos fans than to any other NFL fan. More than that, I just found myself getting too bogged down with the minutiae. While I wanted Fatsis to succeed, I stopped caring about the distance of each kick and his percentage made. I found myself caring for the fate of certain players, but getting frustrated at keeping up with them and the tons of others that I DIDN'T connect with.I ultimately finished the book the day before the official start of the season.
