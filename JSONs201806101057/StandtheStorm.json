Nonetheless, hard work and thriftiness allow them to purchase Ellen (Annie's equally talented daughter) and her daughter, Delia. Prosperity reigns but the clan is happy for only a short while. The threat of re-enslavement looms at every corner as the reality of the times are made clear with the risk of being illegally captured by \"pinchers\" and sold South never to be seen again. There was also the ever-changing laws and complicated slave/freeman policies that deceitful slave owners misuse to extort and exploit freemen, not to mention the nerve-wrecking uncertainty of their status living in a district surrounded by slaveholding states as the country enters the Civil War. The history lessons are supplemented with interludes of courtship and conflict featuring some colorful, charismatic and lovable, yet sympathetic characters who serve as love interests and arch nemeses for Annie and Gabriel. Luck and courage are also factors in their adventures propelling the \"freedom train.\" Their industrious and ingenious survival skills are demonstrated during their humiliating encounters with whites and other undesirables. Unsurprisingly, for a story rooted in this era, the ugliness of racism and sexism are a given and Clarke does not skirt the realities of the degrading, violent sexual abuse that women and children of color endured at the hands of slavers, owners, or any white male in a position of authority. However, through Delia, the author broaches the sensitivities of colorism and the complications that it brings to the Coats's household. Told largely from the freedmen's perspective in Washington's Georgetown district, this literary novel will appeal to Historical Fiction buffs in that it evokes the cadence and archaic vocabulary of the antebellum era and elicits the bittersweet nostalgia that comes with it. The author conjures poignant images to transport the reader back to the bustling rat-infested waterfronts, the narrow, muddy thoroughfares lined with trendy businesses and salacious bordellos, and the horrors of blood-soaked, body-littered battlefields. It is these circumstances that prompts a forlorn Annie (depressed when her beloved Gabriel joins the Union Army) to reminisce about her early years enslaved on the plantation and yearns to return to perceived safety, quiet, and comfort of it. The author continues down this conflicted path as she delves into the complicated familial interrelationships of the Coats clan, the ramifications and hardships of a (slave) mother's love, and its ultimate affects on the ties that bind. This title is well researched and recommended for literary, historical fiction fans or those interested in the challenges of African Americans in the antebellum period.

Some parts were better than others. It reminded me of Lalita Tademy\u2019s book. I wonder if this one also is based on a true story? It doesn\u2019t flow like a novel does. And the writing patterns were jarring. Like the two sentences that decsribed Gabriel and Mary drowning. The last sentence of the paragraph just said: They Drowned. I almost missed it completely. I guess it was an interesting tale of the Civil War as told from the perspective of this family but again, there were some unsettled things. Like why did Gabriel always distrust Delia so much? Where did that come from? And the preference Annie gave to hr son \u2013 his being the lord and master of everything. Was this about how men subjugated women even in the midst of discussing the race issues? This is why it kind of felt like an essay about a specific family drawn from historical documents \u2013 there was no real narrative flow or closure on the personality quirks. No connection between taking the girls to school and then just drowning on the way back. And the old plantation owner gets the tore back (no severnce). I thought it was interesting that Delia ended up kind of saving them all. So although the book was about being black, there was a huge undercurrent about black women and their life, and how they actually supported the superiority of men over them. I liked the ray of hope at the end \u2013 everyone going south to help educate all of their people. The way to catch up to the other race. On Breena Clarke\u2019s website the description of the book (probably written by the publisher) talks about the tragic denouement \u2013 I didn\u2019t find it tragic as much as surprising, and then hopeful in the way that they found a way to turn their situation into a positive one. If it was supposed to be tragic it should have been written better."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3739451-suzanne", "userReview": "\u201cThe boy\u2019s proficiency with needlework was clear from the first, and Pearl was surprised.

The story was captivating from the first pages. There is a tremendous sense of time and place in this novel. Clarke manages to capture the essence and struggles of a black family in this American city. There is so much wonderful history presented here.

Very interesting novel. I learned a lot about the time period -the author did an excellent job of weaving history into the narrative. It was very difficult to read (emotionally) at times but well worth it. The rhythm of the language in the book was challenging for me to become accustomed to initially, but did not keep me from enjoying the book. Once I got the rhythm, I was amazed at the language and how it boosts the enjoyment of the reading. Wonderfully well written, gut-wrenching, intense book. There were times when I felt I was standing there watching it all because Clarke did such a fantastic job of describing the scene and putting it into perspective for the reader. I've read a lot of books about slavery and this time in history but I really enjoyed the perspective of this one and there were moments when I felt as if I'd been punched in the gut by the pure cruelty of some of the experiences described in the book but, overall, it is the story of a family. An interesting family with interesting dynamics that I enjoyed reading about.

A riveting tale about enslavement, struggle, sacrifice, and the Coats, a family that manages to buy their freedom, true freedom.Sewing Annie Coats, the lead character, comes to the realization that slaves with special skills are the last to be sold. So, as the most skilled sewer in her neck of the woods, she does not hesitate to teach her own children, Gabriel and Ellen, every thing she knows about sewing, knitting, weaving, and a horde of other skills. The story unfolds when young Gabriel is sent to work for Abraham Pearl, a kind Georgetown tailor, who teaches Gabriel the ropes of tailoring. In time, the Coats, who become so-called ex-slaves, end up operating their own tailor shop and laundry in Georgetown, a place believed to be heaven on earth for former slaves, but as it turns out, their heavenly paradise is actually a frontier town, with no laws defending African Americans.

The images were so haunting.  I am white and attend a multiracial church with about 80% of the members being african american the first Sunday at church while reading the book I just sat back listening to my pastor and looked around to see all the beautiful people I was surrounded by and to see what they have overcome. It's also saddening to see why the culture struggles even today with so many single african american women raising children in poverty and as my Pastor stated just last sunday the majority of prisoners in our country today is black men. It gives me a heavy heart. The book took a turn for me once the civil war started. There was a disconnect for me in that section of the book and I was startled when Gabriel and Mary died on the way home. It was very abrupt. But then, so is life I suppose and the idea that they went through so much tribulation only to die in a time of peace is still mulling around in my head.  I'm confused why the Author decided to throw in the rape scenes and details about the master abusing and even killing one of his slaves during a rape at one point right at the end there? And without letting us see him get what was coming to him.

There are several areas of strength for me. I feel the author researched the era very well. I appreciate the details that Ms. Clarke uses in her writing. The picture painted of this period in our country's history was vivid. I also feel the subject matter of freed slaves is one that has not been covered as well in historical fiction. There are many books about the American period of slavery, but not many about the struggles of freed slaves. This book gave me a desire to read more about this era.There were weaknesses too. As much as I found the topic compelling, I found my mind wandering as I read the book. I had some difficulty with the writing style. Also, I was a bit uncomfortable with the matriarch's obsession with her son. It did not come across as a positive relationship to me. I also did not feel like I was connected to any of the characters. One of the most sympathetic characters for me was the wife of the main character, but she was a relatively minor character.Overall, an uneven book for me, with both strengths and weaknesses.
