This is the first book that I have read by him. It is about a gambling cruise boat that picks up people in Florida and takes them beyond the 3 mile coastal limit where gambling is legal. But there is more than gambling going on, including drugs and money laundering. The people in this book are just what you would expect from Dave Barry-- misfits, criminals and some downright wacky. There are some laugh out lines in this book. Be prepared for belly laughs. I read it in 2 days.I borrowed this book from a friend."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17042835-tim", "userReview": "Some laugh out loud humor with a decent plot and ending. 8 of 10 stars"}, {"userName": "pinknantucket", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2935034-pinknantucket", "userReview": "Dave Barry is an American columnist who, I have to say, can be very, very funny. Some Australian papers carry his columns from time to time, you might have seen them around. He is also a mate of Carl Hiaasen, a fellow journalist-turned-novelist. This book is humorous and light, except for a few acts of extreme violence, but not quite as good as the Hiaasen\u2019s I have read to date, nor as good as Janet Evanovich. It is better than R is for Ricochet, though.The plot involves several parties, whose paths intertwine on board a small cruise ship that sails offshore every night so that everyone can gamble relatively legally. The ship is also being used to deliver drugs. This particular night there is a big storm, and some bad guys have a plan and quite a lot of guns. There is also a band, a barmaid and two retirees thrown into the mix. Barry also pokes some well-deserved fun at the inanity of news coverage, where, desperate to drum up a story about the storm, news reporters keep racing to the scene of apparent tragedies only to get killed themselves \u2013 thus, they create their own news.If you could only read one more book before you died, this wouldn\u2019t be it. (My personal choice would be Ulysses, because I know it would take me a really, really long time to finish). More the kind of book you\u2019d read on a plane flight, except that you\u2019d probably be more entertained by Carl Hiaasen."}, {"userName": "Patrick Gibson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1758594-patrick-gibson", "userReview": "It\u2019s warped. It pokes outrageous fun at the stupidity in all of us\u2014especially the \u2018us\u2019 who live in Florida (not me\u2014those other people), and it uses adult language like I hear it used in the street all the time. It also has all the good stuff we like in a novel: murder, sex, drugs, violence, hijacking, corrupt government officials, inept authorities, and my favorite subject these days, senior citizens on a casino boat. Isn\u2019t that everyone\u2019s favorite subject?The litany bizarre characters is long and stereotypes galore\u2014all doing amazingly inept things. There is a running gag involving news reporters and a hurricane. It is actually laugh out loud funny. I rarely laugh out loud, period\u2014so that is saying a lot. I am one of those cerebral kind of guys who can sit in a movie and internalize everything that is supposed to be funny without ever laughing. This book pulled it out of me. The murder plot was so convoluted, I didn\u2019t care who did what to whom. Everyone was so busy getting everything wrong and doing it in a spectacular way, I thought I was reading my autobiography (except for the senior citizens on a casino boat stuff). This is wit and satire at its best. Dave may have justly won the Pulitzer for his endless columns but the novel cranks him up to manic speed in a way he can\u2019t let fly in his short prose. Atta boy Dave. It\u2019s lunacy at its finest, and a damn good time.

This book starts out very funny, formulaic but funny. Ok, it is a familair formula (similar to another Florida humorist Carl Hiassen, whom I also follow and enjoy): bad rich developers, bad drug dealers, washed out pothead band, \"heart of gold\" poor waitresses and immigrants - so far so good. A pair of octogenarians and a few local newscasters - just hilarious. (The reader of audiobook - marvelous - with great NY accents for the folks in the retirement home). So why only 3 stars? I so did not expect scenes of horrible violence, graphic and drawn out. The person who had to swallow his own blood to avoid suffocation! Uggh! TMI! Too many gory details! Now, I do not mind a few fart jokes, or a bunch of corpses, all cleanly and quickly shot by guns. But detailed torture - no, thank you!So take your pick: humor or violence."}, {"userName": "Christopher Maher", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1119710-christopher-maher", "userReview": "As should be apparent from my book list, I am a great fan of Barry's writing. I am not, however, a fan of this book.I think this was a bit of a stumble in his follow-up to his first work of fiction, Big Trouble.First, the good. Barry has a knack for creating entertaining characters and for writing individual scenes of great comedy. The book has a running joke of the news coverage of a hurricane in South Florida which is hilarious and spot-on.Now the bad. The book as a whole is just not very good. The premise has elements of the zaniness that made Big Trouble entertaining, but seems more forced than the first book. Also, Barry dips a little deeper into writing what I would term \"adult themes and language,\" in this book. I am someone who enjoys his brand of (often adolescent) humor, but felt these elements were unnecessary to the story and detracted from my reading experience.Despite the negative review, though, I do look forward to reading his next attempt."}, {"userName": "Cissa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1545826-cissa", "userReview": "I was very disappointed by this, after reading 2 Dave Barry novels that were clever, intriguing, and full of fun.In this one, Barry seems to substitute violence, including fairly graphic scenes of torture, for humor.I do not find this a winning strategy.The excessive violence- Ok, mostly toward the Bad Guys- and especially the torture really turned me off. I was not expecting grimdark here.The plot is OK. The senior citizens who save the day are great. The use of farting as a plot device was... interesting. All endedd well except for the Bad Guys, who met gruesome fates.Parts of the plot were silly, and without the violence might have made a much more fun novel.I really do not recommend this one.

It was more coherently plotted, but I don't go to Dave Barry for plot. There was less by way of non-stop humor, but more by way of non-stop obscenity (I know, I know - Barry warned me in the in his \"Acknowledgements and Warning\"). Plus some gratuitous salaciousness and a truly unpleasant instance of sadistic violence. On the other hand, there were parts which were really, really funny (I especially liked the two Roses and \"My Funny Valentine\"). So if you don't mind bad words (see aforementioned \"Acknowledgements ...\"), Tricky Business is probably your book ... IF you know something about seafaring (sailing? boating? watery transportation?) lingo. If, like me, you're not intimate with the differences between ship, boat, dinghy, Zodiac, inflatable and Cigarette; if you don't know a transom from a platform and aren't real clear on what (where?) the stern is, you're going to be in for trouble. I was near the book's end when I realized that I hadn't been keeping track of the various vessels a clear understanding of which was absolutely essential to the slightest grasp of what was going on, and had to start over near the beginning (I am not exaggerating). Even then I had to practically make a written diagram to decipher the second paragraph on page 283. Oh well, I really enjoyed the funny parts."}, {"userName": "Brentin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12058141-brentin", "userReview": "So I've read a bit of Dave Barry's nonfiction work, but not a whole lot. However, this book was kind of a let down. The plot centers around a casino boat that's a front for a drug operation, and how a routine deal is complicated by, among other things, a tropical storm. The cast of characters include the various criminals involved, a pair of retired men, a cocktail waitress, and the ship's band. Nothing about the characters or the criminals are particularly original or clever, and the same can be said of the plot. Of course, the book is meant to be a skewer of crime novels, but it ends up more like a bad parody. The humor relies on fart, puke and boob jokes, as well as little in-jokes people who aren't Floridians would get. There's also a running gag with a local news station that gets old pretty quick.I kind of wondered if Barry wrote the book hoping for a movie option, since it plays out more like a \"Hangover\" type of low-brow comedy, particularly towards the end, where points of view switch almost every 3 sentences, and is told from just about everyone on board, instead of being limited to the main cast. There is one plot twist I didn't see coming, and it's revealed pretty well, but then it goes back to silliness. The book isn't terrible, but definitely not one to be cherished and re-read."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57850113-emily", "userReview": "I read this after seeing it pop up on a \"you might like\" list and recognizing Barry from the \"Peter and the Starcatchers\" series. Now, reviewing the reviews more thoroughly, looks like I should've picked a different Barry novel to start with. This did make me laugh out loud at times, and it was a quick read, and fine. However it wasn't brilliant and witty like Peter & the Starcatchers, and I felt like it was written primarily for guys who'd like to fantasize about being crime bosses but also relate to the underdog (although there's a badass woman heroine snuck in). I didn't mind the violence or language, Barry was really (and cleverly) clear about that at the beginning of the book and besides, it's kind of part of the show in this particular novel. Anyway, if you need a good beach book and you like crime novels, ensemble books, or bumbling and slightly unlikeable underdogs check it out. If you're ready to curl up and be lost in a meaningful story, skip it."}, {"userName": "Linda Doyle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22455789-linda-doyle", "userReview": "A down-on-his-luck musician, a farty, buxom blonde, two stereotypical geezers, and a beautiful undercover agent, are some of the cast of characters in this humorous and too-crazy-to-believe novel that is set, for the most part, on a casino ship off the coast of Florida during a tropical storm.

I finally selected his second novel, Tricky Business, which is set, of course, in Florida. Briefly, it\u2019s the story of what happens when a cast of colorful and eccentric characters all end up on a gambling ship off the coast of Florida during one of the worst hurricanes in memory. But, it\u2019s also much more than just that.When talking about why we enjoy certain books, librarians use the term \u201cappeal factors\u201d and there are generally four or five different factors. This book hits me on three of them: character, story and language. If you\u2019ve ever read Dave Barry before, you know that he\u2019s a master of language and has a talent for finding the funny side in just about anything. Of course, every novel could be said to have the appeal of story, but some authors are just much better story-tellers than others. Dave Barry is one of the very good ones, who crafts a tale that keeps me turning pages and muttering \u201cjust one more chapter\u201d to see what happens next. And lastly, Barry\u2019s characters are the heart of his stories. They are identifiable and interesting, and Barry makes me care what happens to them, whether I\u2019m rooting for the hero or hoping the bad guys get what\u2019s coming to them.The characters in this particular adventure include Fay, an attractive cocktail waitress trying to make ends meet for her kid; a pair of feisty octogenarians who\u2019ve escaped from their rest home; a motley group of dope smoking wanna-be rockers who make up the ship\u2019s band, Johnny and the Contusions; and some south Florida mobsters who use the ship\u2019s nightly voyages for smuggling drugs. The ship is ostensibly simply used to take tourists out to international waters where they can gamble and drink their cares away. But, the owner, tired of being used by the gangsters, decides that tonight is the night to take back his ship and intercept the drug deal for his own. No matter that the news is reporting one doozy of a tropical storm just off the coast, no matter that there are no other ships foolhardy enough to venture out in weather like this. Naturally, wacky antics ensue, but, as I mentioned, Barry does a fabulous job of making the reader actually care about his characters.This novel, much like Barry\u2019s first, Big Trouble, could easily be pictured as a movie. Unfortunately, as we all know, sometimes great books make for not-so-great movies (as was the case with the movie Big Trouble \u2013 a great book and a talented cast, somehow made a rather mediocre movie.) But, I\u2019m still hopeful that Barry will write more novels (he\u2019s been working on a series of Peter Pan adventures with Ridley Pearson lately) and am confident that they\u2019ll be every bit as funny as his first two.Don\u2019t forget to also try some of Dave Barry\u2019s numerous books that contain collections of humorous essays, located in the 814-818 section of our Nonfiction area, too."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2446463-diane", "userReview": "Hi. My name is Diane, and I'm a mystery/crime novel addict. Okay addict might be too much. Mystery and crime novels are my guilty pleasure. (or is that just denial?)I have loved mystery novels ever since I first spotted the gamboge spines of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew on a bookshelf in my father's office. Or maybe it was when my mother gave me her The Bobbsey Twins' Mystery at School from when she was a girl. I enjoy several other Floridan newspaper columnists-cum-crime novelists, most notably Carl Hiaasen and Tim Dorsey. I also enjoy reading mystery/crime novels in which everything goes sideways, ala Elmore Leonard and Lou Berney. To me, Tricky Business was not up to any of the books I have read by these gentlemen. However, Tricky Business was entertaining and quick to read. Tricky Business was a very serviceable Florida, off-beat, crime novel. Fans of Dave Barry's formerly syndicated column may be shocked at the language, sex, violence, and drugs in this book.
