Just cannot believe how horrid people treat others. Mr. Zellner's memoir is a fascinating look at the hatred and evil of racism in the US during the 60's. His first-hand testimony to the Civil Right's movement is fascinating to read and very important. He was constantly beaten and jailed for non-violent protests. I am grateful he stood up against segregation and for the work he did throughout his life. Since a lot of that time was planning and meetings, a lot of the book read like minutes and roll call for those meetings. So many names and acronyms... it sometimes felt like just paragraph after paragraph of names. I feel Bob and his work deserves 5 stars at least. But, some of the writing went so slowly I felt frustrated reading it."}, {"userName": "Susan (aka Just My Op)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489613-susan-aka-just-my-op", "userReview": "A memoir of Bob Zellner's years working with the Freedom Movement in the South, this is a fascinating story. The son and grandson of Klansmen, there is no reason to think Mr. Zellner wouldn't have continued along the same path. Instead, he worked with SNCC to gain civil rights for all, frequently being the target, among many targets, of violence, murder, and unbelievable injustice. He gives his perspective as one of the first whites to join and last whites to leave SNCC. It is horrible that this period in our history was necessary to establish basic human rights, but I am grateful that Mr. Zellner chose to share his experiences. The story is fabulous. The book suffers a bit from lack of editing. There are some editing mistakes that break the flow of reading. There are many names of people involved in the movement, and it is hard to keep them straight and remember which person did what earlier in the story. Despite the riveting story, the book can be a little dry in places. Nevertheless, it is a book well worth reading and a story well worth knowing."}, {"userName": "Rick Edwards", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4333895-rick-edwards", "userReview": "Reading Bob Zellner's memoir is like going home again after a long absence. He delves deep for recollections from college days, when he and the Huntingdon College \"gang of four\" troubled the school's timid administration with their research into the local civil rights movement for a sociology class; and from his work as a SNCC organizer during the early 60's, the influence of his Methodist preacher father and his colleagues, and later work in New Orleans and the Northeastern U.S. Many of those he names are people I knew well myself through the Methodist Alabama-West Florida Conference; among his supporters were Methodist clergy who were my heroes."}, {"userName": "Florence", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1649751-florence", "userReview": "Bob Zellner tells of his firsthand experience in the Civil Rights movement, as a SNCC volunteer. At the end of the book he briefly mentions that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and I am not surprised. The violence that Zellner and his colleagues were subjected to was astounding. All were willing to die and some actually gave their lives in the struggle for freedom. The courage and vision that they shared of a world not stunted by racism inspired me. I was privileged to meet Bob Zellner at the Virginia Festival of the Book in March of 2010."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5092138-gary", "userReview": "Bob Zellner\u2019s memoir of growing up in southern Alabama \u2013 the son and grandson of Klansmen \u2013 and his subsequent development into a civil rights militant.

In the early 1960s, when Bob Zellner's professors and classmates at a small church school in Alabama thought he was crazy for even wanting to do research on civil rights, it was nothing short of remarkable. Now, in his long-awaited memoir, Zellner tells how one white Alabamian joined ranks with the black students who were sitting-in, marching, fighting, and sometimes dying to challenge the Southern \"way of life\" he had been raised on but rejected. Decades later, he is still protesting on behalf of social change and equal rights. Fortunately, he took the time, with co-author Constance Curry, to write down his memories and reflections. He was in all the campaigns and was close to all the major figures. He was beaten, arrested, and reviled by some but admired and revered by others. The Wrong Side of Murder Creek, winner of the 2009 Lillian Smith Book Award, is Bob Zellner's larger-than-life story, and it was worth waiting for.", "title": "The Wrong Side of Murder Creek: A White Southerner in the Freedom Movement", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4231256-the-wrong-side-of-murder-creek", "average": 3.94, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347693155l/4231256.jpg", "reviews": 19, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1784140.Bob_Zellner", "name": "Bob Zellner"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/104143.Constance_Curry", "name": "Constance Curry"}], "type": ["History", "Historical", "Biography", "Nonfiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4231256-the-wrong-side-of-murder-creek"]}
