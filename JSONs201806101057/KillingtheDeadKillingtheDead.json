Hell, they even end up in an old farm house, just like The Walking Dead.Of course, in this story, we have a serial killer named Ryan as our narrator. Oh, nifty! It's like totally original, right? Well, considering he's actually compared to Dexter in this story, because of Ryan's so-called code of killing, it's really not so original. Because, Ryan doesn't kill just anybody. He only kills people who deserve it. Oh, and zombies, of course. Just like Dexter!The problem is, this story doesn't have any of the depth of character as even the worst of The Walking Dead episodes. I spent the entire time reading this story, hoping they would all die a horrible death. I kept thinking, maybe they will die while getting burned alive, while being eaten by zombies, while being raped by hung black guys.One can only hope, right? Oh, and don't get me started on this guy's use of the word 'whilst', as in \"Cover me, whilst I chop at these zombies with my cleaver.\" Or, Whilst I gathered canned goods, the girls were busy cooking upstairs. Or, whilst I jack off in this girl's face, make sure to take a selfie, at just the right moment, whilst I ejaculate.Okay, sure, I know this story is set in London, or somewhere in Britain, but come on man. The word has its uses, I'm sure, but not in every goddamn paragraph, for fuck's sake.Please excuse me, whilst I wipe me bum with this stupid story.I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.Visit My Book Review Blog and Follow me on Twitter"}, {"userName": "Ozsaur", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17781193-ozsaur", "userReview": "So I got the first and second books for free and read them back to back. This one had an interesting start with Ryan, a serial killer, and Lily, a woman who happens to find him while running from a pack of zombies.First, I'm not sure I buy Ryan as a serial killer. His characterization is hit or miss for me. Sometimes, the writer nails his alienation from others, and his need to kill. Other times... I feel like Ryan's thoughts don't really ring true. For the most part, the book was okay. The thing that bothered me the most, though, is that I kept getting the nagging feeling that I'd read this book before. A couple of scenes felt very familiar. On the other hand, there were a few unexpected developments, so I think I've just read way too many zombie novels, and I already know a lot of the beats.The ending was abrupt, and the second book starts immediately after. If I had paid for this one, and didn't have the second book, I would have been mad, but I was able to keep reading."}, {"userName": "Lucas Darathy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27597430-lucas-darathy", "userReview": "I'm sorry to say that this was bad. The writing was awful. The characters weren't believable at all. The main character was pathetic. \"Serial killer\", right.

After hearing a frantic knocking Ryan finds himself letting Lily into his house after realising she is being pursued by zombies. Lily soon discovers she is in the presence of a serial killer but instead of leaving she sets some ground rules. Has she just made a huge mistake or will Ryan surprise even himself?While only being a short book there is plenty of action packed between it's pages. Ryan makes an unusual lead character but I find myself liking him.I am looking forward to reading book two Search For Safety and finding out more about Ryan and Lily. I give this book 4 stars would have liked it to be longer I finished it much to quickly.

Here's the short version as to why: \"Status update\"  Besides the lack of needed commas and apostrophes, the plot has become a drag. The narrator has a habit of rambling about nonsense when he's supposed to be concentrated on running from these fucking zombies. And he goes over every detail of the new characters' appearances and *spontaneously combusts* Seriously. It's sad because this book had sooo much potential, but it squandered it big time. I wanted to love this book, hence why I read over half the book.

We're meant to be impressed by the \"psychopath\" as a hero, not to see that this is a glorified televised \"cool\" version of a psychopath that a desperately horny teenager might write about, with the helpless pretty bossy girl just falling in love with him? The whole concept was grating and badly thought out and the author should have done some research first.And the story was so predictable, of the many free apocalypse based books I've read (that then hope you'll pay several pounds for every bloody boom after that) this went pretty much the way I expected. Including the man deciding to be hero and hunter gatherer whilst the girls do proper girl work like the laundry and the cooking and generally huddle together helplessly to boost the author/heroes ego.."}, {"userName": "Leonor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12399768-leonor", "userReview": "A quick review: the story is interesting enough, with the whole premise of the psychopath serial killer being the sort-of hero, but the lack of punctuation was driving me mad - commas exist for a reason, and should be used where appropriate! The apostrophe also seems not to be a favourite, and the author seems to struggle between writing in British English (\"colour,\" \"whilst,\") and American English (\"cell phone,\" \"ton\"). As much as I'd love to keep reading and find out how things progress, I'm sure the other books will be as lacking in correct punctuation as this one, so I'm giving this saga a pass.

He opens the door to Lilly, a frightened woman who is being chased by zombies. She explains that the world is being taken over by the living dead.Then Lilly discovers Ryan\u2019s secret hobby \u2013 killing the living. We discover that Ryan is a serial killer from the North of England and that he believes his best chance of survival in this new world of The Undead is to be part of a group. Lilly agrees to be part of his group \u2013 but with rules and conditions.Ryan and Lilly then set off on an action-packed adventure, being chased by zombies as they search for somewhere safe.The concept in Killing The Dead is brilliant. A serial killer in a zombie apocalypse. It\u2019s great to read a zombie apocalypse story set in Britain, written by a British Writer.Ryan\u2019s character was fascinating. Cold and logical but still likeable. The other characters felt two dimensional and lacked development \u2013 but this was probably due to the relative short length of the novella format. I think the story would have been better as a novel.Ryan\u2019s character was so captivating, that his perspective was enough to make the reader want to read on. The use of hooks would have benefited the story. As would the use shorter sentences for action scenes, which would have added to the readers sense of tension.Killing The Dead had good description and perfect pacing, however the ending was a bit abrupt and left the reader with no sense of conclusion or satisfaction. I have since discovered that this novella is part of a series \u2013 it\u2019s good to know that more of the story will be told.A lack of editing let Killing The Dead down. There were sentences that didn\u2019t make sense due to missed or wrong words, a few grammatical inaccuracies and similarities that just didn\u2019t work.Overall, you\u2019ll enjoy Killing The Dead by Richard Murray, which is available to download for free (at time of writing this review) on Amazon."}, {"userName": "Tsubaki", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31747458-tsubaki", "userReview": "I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.-I'm usually not into zombie apocalypse themed anything, but decided to give this book a chance because of the main character. Our narrator was not your usual sympathetic, average, everyman terrified out of his mind with the prospect of trying to survive. Nor was he a hardened military man/police officer struggling with justice and morality while faced with a crumbling world and indiscriminate killing. He was a charming, psychotic, sociopathic, seasoned, serial killer whose just been given full access to a rapidly changing world. Ryan certainly brings something new to the table. Despite his little side hobby, he wasn't an abhorrent individual like you'd imagine. He's very childish actually, innocent, and genuinely curious about the new world he's been plunged into. The rules are changing and seeing that changed world through his eyes was even more fun than I had expected. Lily, his unexpected companion, was thankfully, not the damsel in distress I had feared her to be. She's strong willed, more than capable of pulling her own weight, and fearless in her dealings with the undead and with Ryan. As the story progressed, they met and picked up other characters, some I liked, others, I wished the zombies would just hurry up and mutilate.The story kind of reminded me of a cross between World World Z and Zombieland actually. But if the zombie apocalypse ever hits (and I'm still waiting), these are the people I'd want at my side. Granted, there were some baffling character decisions, actions, and parts that seem to plague any story in this genre. If Ryan had an entire case of knives, why would Lily just take two instead of the whole thing? Would've made their lives much easier if she had. Etc, etc, etc, all said and done, they're all minor things. The story does need better editing, but for the most part, it was nicely put together, well planned, and perfectly executed. Really, can't wait to dive into the second book."}, {"userName": "Scarlet", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14153571-scarlet", "userReview": "Killing the dead by Richard MurrayWho better to have by your side in the middle of a zombie apocalypse than an experienced killer?This is exactly what happens to lily, when she knocks on the nearest door begging for help whilst running from zombies. She meets Ryan and even though she is horrified by him being a serial killer, in this new apocalyptic world numbers mean safety so she decides to stay with him for a little while trusting him when he promises he won't hurt her.Ryan starts to feel something whilst with Lily, something he cannot explain and soon finds himself needing lily to like him, promising not to kill innocent people ever again and meaning it. On the road to safety they meet different people and see lots of horror.Even getting separated they manage to find each other again at a local military safety area and find their group growing in numbers.But once again the zombies come and overwhelm the guards, breaking into the compound, Ryan's quick thinking gets them out of the area quickly and they even manage to save another group of people. I enjoyed this adventure with Lily and Ryan. I'm hoping that as the series progresses that Ryan gives up his murdering ways and becomes somebody that the group can depend on.Its quite a unique story, I don't think I have ever read a zombie story written from the point of view of a serial killer. I also enjoyed the fact that the story is based in the uk where we don't really have guns, and so the characters were forced to find other weapons, knives, crow bars, baseball bats etc."}, {"userName": "Reuben Miles", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14006831-reuben-miles", "userReview": "I received this book for free in return for an honest review.This is the first zombie novel I've ever read. Having neglected such a popular genre for so long, I'm glad that Murray's Killing The Dead was the one that welcomed me in. It's not a work of genius, opting for brute force over poise and subtlety, but who needs literary balance when there's tension, fear and adrenaline in bucket-loads?The story moves at a cracking pace, the main character is grimly charming, and the central (blossoming) romance is well conceived. In addition to the fantastic blood and guts, there's a cerebral edge to the tone, which added welcome depth.The plot would have benefited from a little more breathing space. It would have been interesting to get to know the intricacies of Ryan's mind, how he bacame who he is, why he's on the path he is. In essence, a back-story.The writing itself is of a high standard and quality; Murray certainly knows how to pen a sentence. I think that the book would have benefit from a little more editing. Just sometimes, the burning fire at the heart of the story was clouded by smoke. But that didn't get in the way of what was, at its core, a breathtaking romp.Well worth the read and recommended to any fan of the genre, or indeed anyone who likes to follow intriguing characters on white-knuckle adventures."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31802291-jackie", "userReview": "Such a strange phenomenon. As an outsider viewing into the life of another, we tend to understand them, approve of their situation and their logic becomes ours. In this case, we follow the life of homicidal maniac as his special 'hobby' gets a minor interruption when the dead comes back to life and starts eating people. It seems we have \"walked\" a mile in his shoes and somehow approve of his actions to kill others simply because they are a minor annoyance and inconvenience. I'm not sure if this falls into the category what I believe is the 'Stockholm Syndrome'. Where the captured feels for his/her captor. I seem to oddly agree with some of his actions, be it the fantasy of ridding your life of these annoyances that our ID creates but our ego keeps in check, or the fact that we always seem to agree with whichever 'side' we're on. We somehow follow blindly without questioning or challenging these actions.All in all, I felt it was wonderfully written and made me agree even though in the back of my mind I know it to be wrong. Highly recommend and look forward to continuing this series."}, {"userName": "Marco C", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26853004-marco-c", "userReview": "Not a bad story.It gets better as you keep reading. The beginning is a bit shaky, but eventually it settles into a good story.The protagonist angle is different. At least new to me. I am not sure it exploited in full for much of the book, but it is a serial and I have only read the first book so far. The story arc is just now getting interesting, at the end of book 1.If I have a complaint, more of thought than a complaint, is that the main character should be either a sociopath or someone struggling with a compulsion to be more credible. Serial killers are by and large sociopaths and unlikely to feel emotions and empathy the way most people do. This one seems to be a mix of sociopathic and \"normal\" behavior. Then again, I guess it is a spectrum like in many other areas and I can't fault the author for choosing to portray the protagonist with at least some redeeming qualities. It would have been hard to get involved otherwise.I will actually get the other books. The story seems like is going in a positive direction."}, {"userName": "Roger Jackson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11312667-roger-jackson", "userReview": "Killing the Dead by Richard Murray was an unusual read for me. I'm generally not a zombie fan unless the story has something different to offer. This book did.The main character, Ryan, is a sociopathic serial killer. He's sort of a likable sociopath, as sociopaths go. The apocalypse is typical: dead bodies rise to become zombies due to an infection and start chewing on the living. But the story isn't really about that. It is about Ryan using his \"special abilities\" to cope with the situation, and the relations that develop between him and the other characters. Ryan is well-acquainted with killing, and now he can kill the dead without fear of retribution. His talents can finally come out into the light of day instead of being hidden away in his basement. His new acquaintances learn this about him, but decide his sociopathic tendencies can be an asset.Overall, the writing was good and the story kept my interest. I would recommend Killing the Dead if you enjoy zombies and character based stories. It is a quick, entertaining read."}, {"userName": "Sasha Rivera", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27552226-sasha-rivera", "userReview": "i think that i would have been friends only during the apocalyptic with the main character. just because of what he was doing before people started became zombies. the main character had me laughing and scared all at the same time. why? well because one he was a serial killer, second he knew how to survive even if he didn't like being near other people. so we would have gotten along just great. i love my personal space too. with hat being said, i really really loved this book. if i had a list of rereading books. this book will be definitely on it."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17206084-lisa", "userReview": "What a great read and a great idea for a book - the combination of a serial killer and a zombie apocalypse was genius, possibly my 2 favourite genres mashed into one.
