And upon thinking for a while and discissing it with Christina for a while I've come to the conclusion that my opinion is based on a two-fold rubric. (Can rubrics have folds?)Anyway...Point 1. Character Development. The character development in this book sucked balls. And not in the good way, either. Point 2. Plot.The plot was fuckin' awesome. Except for the fact that it didn't start until a third of the way into the book. But whatev. It's still a clever story filled with science!

Amy is supposed to be some quirky gal whose personal slang consists of \"mook,\" \"jeepers,\" and other silly stuff. But she didn't develop that characteristic until we'd met her a half a dozen times. Another example, and I'll try to spare you details, occurrs @ the end of the book. There's a reunion. And it should be romantic and touching, but it's not. It's just quick and flat. Why even bother? Pissed me off. Alrighty, plot... Underwater city and additional theories of evolution--genius! Carbon based passenger vessels navigated neurogically--double genius! Loved it. Kick ass. Cool. And then they saved the world. No surprises there. That's all I have to say, really.

I was excited to try one of his novels, and frankly, I\u2019m usually a sucker for otherwise human stories with some elements of the unexplained (see Tom Robbins, \u201cMagnolia\u201d, or Lost). Moore\u2019s \u201cFluke\u201d started out as no exception. I was engaged by the characters, laughed out loud a few times, and was hooked into these mysterious events and the promise of something larger. The insertion of scientific fact (mostly marine biology and humpback whales) and mysterious Defense Department goings-on only increased my interest. That same blend of factoids/anecdotes into somewhat bizarre fiction has caused me to tear through a few Chuck Palahniuk novels, and that\u2019s the sort of pace with which \u201cFluke\u201d flies by. So, it can\u2019t be all bad. The story just lost me when it started explaining too much. I think I like my mysteries unresolved, or at least not so neat. Not to geek out too much, but I had this same feeling during the second season of Lost. I felt disappointed when too much was attributed to some psychology experiment and everyone stopped being afraid of going in the jungle. Here, there\u2019s a different explanation. And even though the second half of the book was entirely original, with its own absorbing twists and turns, it felt like a different book; like something I hadn't signed up for. All of the new developments started feeling less like originality and more like a cop out. The character development dropped off, replaced with fantasy/sci-fi explanations that I just didn\u2019t care for. It\u2019s still a funny, mostly engaging read, but I finished \u201cFluke\u201d with that feeling that is never a sign of a book gone well: I didn\u2019t want more.

Things are further complicated when the town crazy informs him that the whale he saw called her and asked her to tell him to come visit the whale and bring a pastrami on rye sandwich. There are a few memorable characters such as the Jersey boy who claims he is Hawaiian and a Rastafarian or the assistant who is smoking hot, but slightly not human.

Or even merely had a lukewarm feeling for. Fluke is no exception. I mean, how can you not like a writer who produces such lines as \"A centipede the size of a Pontiac had once lived in the bottom-right corner of the trunk but had long since moved on once he realized that no one was ever going to bother him, so he could stand up on his hind hundred feet, hiss like a pissed cat, and deliver a deadly bite to a naked foot\"?Moore writes about things he cares about -- and there are hundreds of them, from people to whales to fruit bats to island paradises to conservation issues to the inevitable jerks who make life so interesting, and on and on and on. In Fluke he gives us whales and their lives, and those who study them. But rather than the predictably over-emotional, politically charged, and buzzword rhetoric that makes up 98% of Green hyperbola on the subject, Moore gives us real people studying real whales -- and the real catastrophes and downsides frequently accompanying such studies.Why do humpback whales sing? Marine biologist Nate Quinn and his crew poke, chart, record, and photograph huge, wet, marine mammals trying to find answers to that question. And then, one day, a whale lifts his tail into the air to display a cryptic message on his flukes: Bite me.The problem is that only Nate saw that message. He's beginning to wonder if Hawaii's hot sun has baked his brains a little too thoroughly. Neither his longtime partner, Clay Demodocus, nor their young research assistant, Amy, not even their other assistant, addlepated, pot-smoking, white-boy Rastafarian Kona (a.k.a. Preston Applebaum) saw it. But later, when a roll of film comes back from the film lab with the crucial frame missing, the one that shows those flukes and the message on them, and his research facility is trashed, Nate begins to think there's more to this than a mere hallucination.What can you say about this novel? Witty, irreverent, puzzling, fascinating, and surprising, Fluke is Moore at the top of his form -- and a great incentive to track down and read everything he's ever written."}, {"userName": "DJ Harris", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18766325-dj-harris", "userReview": "Christopher Moore does it again!

I picked it up because whales are one of my favorite animals, and I have always loved listening to their singing. Also, I hadn't read a funny book in a while, and needed a break from the 'serious' stuff.I have to say it: It's a whale of a tale!The book starts out fairly normal, but then, takes a turn into the land of the zany. Really. You will have no idea what hit you. And that, truly, is the best part.It's a pretty fast-paced read, and the humor is great! I especially loved the subtle humor and the innuendo. Always fun. Author's Note (from the official site): What do most people know about whales beyond that fact that theyre big and wet? Not much, right? Well, having been a scuba diver for a long time, and lived next to the ocean for some twenty-five years, I thought, I really should learn more about these big wet things that keep swimming by. So I started learning about whales, and more important, the people whose business it is to learn about whales. Something happens when you spend any amount of time on the ocean with people who have a less than conservative view of how one should make his living: you begin to feel that adventure is its own reward. You begin to measure experience, rather than sustenance, as the goal; and you begin to get a feeling for those adventurers you left behind in your childhood: those salty rapscallions sprung from the imaginations of Jack London and Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson -- even the twisted eccentrics of Joseph Conrad and the ancient undersea beings of H.P. Lovecraft. (And you begin, too, to wish youd brought along some Dramamine.) As a writer, you get it, the same way that you got it when you were a kid, and theres not much you can do but share the adventures. So I got it, and Im passing it on to you, that \"fear recalled in comfort\" that is called the adventure story. Have fun. Sincerely, Christopher MooreMy Note: Save the whales!

Not to mention I have an irrepressible fascination with anything to do with the sea, making this book an automatic winner unless I was just bored out of my mind. I didn't even mind that it didn't have vampires in it. Actually with all of the vampire literature out there it was nice to find something that was interesting that DIDN'T have to do with vampires. It was a nice mystery, science-fiction adventure for me. I got to go to Hawaii and hang out with some behavioral scientists, studying whales and then go to an underwater city filled with human-cetaceous mutants, not to mention the dictator with a messiah complex. It was a pretty nice little jaunt under the sea and I enjoyed it. What I didn't like was the continual use of \"I think something and then I say it\" such as \"Nate was suddenly cold, and when he opened eyes, he was pretty sure that his head was going to explode. 'I'm pretty sure my head is going to explode,' he said.\". Once was okay and cute, but over and over just got on my nerves. It's a good thing I like stories about whales, even if they are written to propagandize.

Worldbuilding can easily weigh a novel down, especially when it begins over one hundred pages in. Instead I felt that, after wandering around giggling at itself for fifteen chapters, Fluke was finally going somewhere.However, the vast majority of the story goes by with little to no real conflict and, once the danger finally presents itself, it disappears shortly afterwards doing almost no damage whatsoever.

While this type of explanation would usually put me off reading more of his books, his writing is done so well and the stories so inventive and hilarious that I can't help but enjoy them. This book is about hump back whale researchers living in Hawaii, and while I'm no marine biologist the facts all seemed very well researched. A group of researchers are involved in figuring out why the hump backs sing and what they may be saying to each other, which throws the head researcher into a crazy adventure he could never have imagined.

Christopher Moore tackles the scientific mystery of whale song in his own unique way. This book is wildly creative and funny while being surprisingly well researched. It appears that Mr. Moore spent a fair amount of time with biologists and whale researchers in Hawaii preparing to write this book. In Fluke Moore takes a serious topic and blends in just the right amount of absurdity. The story is intriguing and well-paced. I loved the characters, loved the whales, laughed aloud and just had a lot of fun with this book. I especially enjoy Moore's gift for simile and visual imagery.I\u2019d recommend this to anyone who enjoys Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett and/or Kurt Vonnegut \u2013 all masters of absurd humor and keen observers of humanity.

In Fluke, I especially like when the narrator tells us something doofy a characters is thinking, and then the character says it aloud. That tickled me every time; apparently it's a humor button somewhere in my brain that loves to be pushed.Right off the bat, there are a lot of characters, and it's not always clear who they are or what they do. There's Nathan Quinn, sometimes called \"Nate\" by the narrator, sometimes \"Quinn\" (please be consistent, Moore). There's Amy. Then we meet Cliff Hyland and Captain Tarwater. Add on Kona, Clay, and Clair, and stuff gets messy in my head. You can't have that many \"C\" names in the first chapter and expect me to keep them straight. At the end of the book I felt I could name several characters who were superfluous, which made the reading harder than necessary. People also seemed more sexually focused than I've known people in real life to be. I don't think we're all quite as humpy as Moore would let his characters lead us to believe. For instance, Clair, age 40, can make Clay, age 50, do whatever she wants by reminding him she has \"the booty.\" Well, yes, Clair, but at some point Clay is going to make autonomous decisions.The science in the book isn't too complicated to understand, and Moore admits in the end note (he always has one, to my knowledge) that while he talked to a lot of whale scientists, he ignored much of what they said and kept the stuff that would easily fit. The science that is in the book is light enough to be believable, but understandable, which is right where I like it (I'm right in the middle of The Martain, so I'm definitely thinking science and how much I can fit into my brain without getting lost).The plot gets undeniably wacky starting in Part 2 of 3 when Nate is swallowed by a whale and lives to tell the story for some highly imaginative reasons. It's been so long since I've read a book that actually world builds and creates using sheer imagination that I'm still reeling from what I read. Through it all, I could picture everything that Moore described, even if a lot of those descriptions compared things to \"butt holes\" (hey, I know what one is, so I can't deny picturing what Moore wants me to see). There seems to be a sort of \"why not?\" attitude in Moore's writing that could easily have tripped him up, but worked nonetheless.The conclusion wasn't what I thought it would be. Things happened more easily than the world building had suggested it could, but I also didn't want the book to go on further. Nate spent enough time in each setting long enough, and really, how do you logically wrap up such a book?Enjoyable, sassy, and stretches the imagination if you let it."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1233686-megan", "userReview": "Fluke: Or, I Know Why the Winged Wale Sings was pretty good. Eventually. Once I got into it. Christopher Moore is hard to review. He strikes me as more of a comedian than an author. As such, if he keeps me entertained and makes me laugh out loud, I consider his book to be a success. Fluke is a typical Christopher Moore story in that it involves a group of wacky people working together in a preposterous situation. The whale and conservation info presented here was cool. And chapter eighteen wins best chapter title ever award: Chapter Eighteen, Heinous Fuckery Most Foul! =) I\u2019m glad I went with the audio version of this book. Narrator Bill Irwin did a great job with the different voices and accents and gave the characters a lot of life. (Which sounds totally lame, but Christopher Moore\u2019s characters all tend to be sarcastic and kind of snarky people. He writes the sort of characters which I think work fantastically in the right movie, but can fall flat in print.) Christopher Moore fans will enjoy this one. While I don\u2019t feel that it was as well written as Bloodsucking Fiends, You Suck or The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror it made me laugh quite a bit. That\u2019s gotta count for something =)"}, {"userName": "Dave Hinchliffe", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3765261-dave-hinchliffe", "userReview": "Christopher Moore writes funny books. His recent titles have been likened to the novels of Terry Pratchett but perhaps better comparisons can be drawn with Carl Hiassen and Douglas Adams. His novels have dealt with demons, Jesus\u2019 best pal, bloodsucking fiends, death and sequined love nuns amongst other improbable subject matter. Clearly this is an author in no danger of taking himself too seriously.Fluke is all about Whales, kind of. It is also about half-whale half-human beasts, strange undersea realms and, of course, Amelia Erhardt. The story begins when Nathan Quinn, a marine biologist, photographs the tail fin of a whale whilst on a routine research trip. Later whilst looking over his pictures he notices that the words \"BITE ME\" are spelled out in huge letters on the mammal's tail-fin. His ensuing investigations turn up one mystery after another as he is launched into a wild adventure. Moore\u2019s great skill is to turn in a tightly plotted and humorous adventure yarn around this wild subject matter. He even manages to inject a strong ecological message as well. The book is set in Hawaii where Moore used to live and the author\u2019s personal experience with marine biology ensures the accuracy of detail in this unique and entertaining read.(this review was first published at http://www.whitesandsthailand.com)"}], "description": "Just why do humpback whales sing? That's the question that has marine behavioral biologist Nate Quinn and his crew poking, charting, recording, and photographing very big, wet, gray marine mammals. Until the extraordinary day when a whale lifts its tail into the air to display a cryptic message spelled out in foot-high letters: Bite me.Trouble is, Nate's beginning to wonder if he hasn't spent just a little too much time in the sun. 'Cause no one else on his team saw a thing -- not his longtime partner, Clay Demodocus; not their saucy young research assistant; not even the spliff-puffing white-boy Rastaman Kona (n\u00e9 Preston Applebaum). But later, when a roll of film returns from the lab missing the crucial tail shot -- and his research facility is trashed -- Nate realizes something very fishy indeed is going on.By turns witty, irreverent, fascinating, puzzling, and surprising, Fluke is Christopher Moore at his outrageous best.", "title": "Fluke: Or, I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33441.Fluke", "average": 3.74, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1168444068l/33441.jpg", "reviews": 2019, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16218.Christopher_Moore", "name": "Christopher Moore"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Humor", "Fantasy", "Humor", "Humor"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33441.Fluke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565936-fluke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130589-aleta", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15826965-fluke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1325339.Fluke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/594375.Fluke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28881.Lamb", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33456.A_Dirty_Job", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33454.Bloodsucking_Fiends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3684856-fool", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33453.You_Suck", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
