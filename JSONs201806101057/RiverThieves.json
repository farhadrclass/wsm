The characters are portrays as multilayered flawed individuals faced with difficult choices to make in order to survive in a harsh landscape.

The British governor hopes to establish cordial relations with the Beothuk, also called Red Indians for the red ochre they used to paint their bodies. Responding to his call to bring back a Beothuk who will learn English and serve as an intermediary, John Peyton and a band of men find a camp and capture a Beothuk woman, setting in motion a series of tragic encounters between the Indians and the Europeans.John Peyton joins his father, John Senior, on one of his regular trips to Newfoundland from England when he is only a boy of fourteen. He never returns to England and learns instead the life of a trapper and fisherman, working his father\u2019s extensive holdings in the new land. He works with trappers who have participated in Indian wars and taken opportunities for wanton cruelty, who have married Indians and moved to the interior, who have trapped alone among both tribes for decades, or who have lived in the growing port of St. John\u2019s, surviving fires and famine. They live hard lives of deprivation, violence, and physically exhausting work with little reward.Cassie Jura leaves St. John\u2019s to tend house for John Senior and tutor young John Peyton. A woman who knows the outdoors as well as any man, Cassie is also erudite and stoic. With her trunk of books, she teaches the young boy about Shakespeare and the larger world, but tells nothing of herself. She knows little about John Senior except that he lets her live her life while he traps and hunts. When John Peyton brings home a Beothuk woman named Mary, it becomes Cassie\u2019s job to teach her English.This is a stunning tale of life in the 1800s in an unforgiving land among hardened settlers. The characters are superbly drawn. The women are especially well developed\u2014Cassie, Annie Boss, and Mary, among others. I couldn\u2019t get enough of Annie Boss, a Micmac woman married to Reilly, an Irish trapper. The prejudices and fears and hatred cut across every nationality, religion, race, occupation, challenging the men and women at every step. The book is a joy to read. Crummy holds the reader with every sentence, urging the reader to take time with each thought, each turn of phrase or incident.

Most of the planters and fishermen returned to England for the winter, as did the governor himself.\nRiver Thieves is a fictional imagining of a real historic time that author Michael Crummey populated with real people (those on the side whose stories have survived anyway) and it reads like a history lesson, an adventure tale, and a finely wrought piece of ironic literature -- no matter how well-intentioned the players involved, the reader can see the noose tightening and the inevitability of a tragic outcome. I was fighting against myself reading this book: wanting to keep reading to see what would happen and desperately wanting to put this book down and turn my mind to something else. In the early 1800s -- with Newfoundland sparsely populated outside of St. John's and the indigenous Beothuk driven into the inhospitable interior of the island -- Governor Duckworth and his representative, British naval officer James Buchan, were determined to establish a friendly relationship with the \"Red Indians\" (so named for the ochre that they rubbed onto their bodies and belongings). Buchan travelled to the northeast shore -- where there resided colonists who had had sightings of the Beothuk -- and he encouraged several of these men to join his expedition to make contact. Buchan's ultimate goal was to convince one of the Natives to return with him, learn English, and become an interpreter between the two peoples; even if \"convincing\" meant \"kidnapping\". The expedition goes wrong and Governor Duckworth calls an end to the efforts.A decade later, after more skirmishes between the Beothuk and the settlers, Buchan returns under the orders of a new governor, and this time, he learns of the hidden histories of attacks and reprisals, crimes and outrages, prejudices and outright murder. As Buchan once again leads a group into the frozen wilds of the interior, it's unclear whether or not there are any Beothuk left to contact. Humanising this grand sweep of events, River Thieves is fleshed out with a fascinating array of characters, each with their own private histories, expertly unveiled. As the reader learns of each character's hidden motivations, it becomes easier to spot the villains, but no easier to prevent the Beothuk's fate.\nWe have taken the tragedy of an entire race of people, Mr. Peyton, and cheapened it with our own sordid little melodrama.\nI was fascinated by this concept: I have no idea if Duckworth and Buchan's intentions were really this altruistic -- find a way to communicate with the Beothuk, even if it means taking and educating one of them against his will -- but without a method of communicating, the cycle of misunderstandings, theft, reprisal, ambushes, and \"recompense\" would never end, and ultimately, it didn't matter who started the cycle: it was inevitable who would come out on top. But were the British overlords really more compassionate towards the Beothuk than they were everywhere else on the continent? As Crummey outlines his research at the end, I'll have to take his word for it unless I decide to go to original sources myself. Crummey expertly captured the minutia of the era -- in both the domestic and political spheres -- with an especial focus on the work of the men; the fishing, trapping, hunting, and dressing of meat and furs. He also has a real talent for writing women characters and the lives and labours of both Cassie and Annie Boss were totally believable. The history of this time was very interesting with the British government's stance on Newfoundland being influenced by the recent Revolutionary War in America, the shifting relationship with the French during and after the Napoleonic wars, and the hierarchy of prejudices among the colonists themselves: the British brought with them their firm class system with which to judge each other, but they all looked down their noses at Irish Catholics and Natives, while the Mi'kmaq who settled on Newfoundland with the French felt superior to the Beothuk (and as for Buchan, every time he was confronted with English atrocities, he was pleased to point out that he was Scottish). Capturing a long gone time and place with a prose style that is as spare and lovely as Newfoundland itself, Crummey's first novel is an engaging and worthwhile read.\nThe sun had fallen below the ceiling of grey cloud, illuminating the enormous stretch of ice, and the snow on the branches of spruce terraced on the valley's hills burned gold all around them. It was like walking into a cathedral lit with candles and the group stood there exhausted and breathing heavily, leaning on walking sticks and bent forward to balance the weight of their packs, all with the worn look of awe of a group of pilgrims."}, {"userName": "Jay Warner", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3138620-jay-warner", "userReview": "Michael Crummey hails from Nova Scotia, where the book is set, so its no wonder he can describe in such intimate detail the little rivers and creeks, necks and beaches, hills, and valleys. I found myself totally immersed in the world that was St. John in the early 1800s, the lives of the trappers and the interference of the English. Crummey brought the time period to life in ways I could never get from a history book. He also takes a very daring approach to historical fiction in his depictin of the Red Indians and the MicMacs, given that our current \"political correctness\" sometimes causes us to whitewash the way that Native Americans were thought of, and treated. This is a nice contrast to Louise Erdrich's books which are from the viewpoint of the native. Crummey's book is from the viewpoint of the trapper. There are also graphic descriptions of trapping practices including setting traps, coming upon a frightened animal who has tried to chew its way out of a leg trap, slaughter, and skinning. These sections of the book are not for the squeamish. If you have any interest in early pre-nation settlement of Canada, you will love this book as much as I do."}, {"userName": "Mary Billinghurst", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4509487-mary-billinghurst", "userReview": "I reread this novel for a presentation I have volunteered to do at the library. Honestly, I rarely reread books anymore since I have so many new ones I want to get through, but I am very glad I picked up River Thieves again. It is very good.I love Crummey's narrative technique in this book. He outlines the key event of the plot (the capture of a Beothuk woman) at the very beginning, and then he returns to this moment many times as the story develops. Each time, we learn more details. It is as if Crummey has drawn a colouring book which he fills in vividly during the course of his work. Crummey seamlessly moves back and forth through history as well, giving us the main characters' backstories, to help us know them better. The characters are very richly drawn as a result.In this, his first novel, Crummey explores the history and the culture of his native province, Newfoundland, something he does again in his later books, The Wreckage and Galore. His common thematic foci of unrequited love and the struggle against nature are introduced here."}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1521651-irene", "userReview": "I LOVED Michael Crummy's second novel, The Wreckage. I had River Thieves for months before starting it, for fear of being disappointed. I wasn't ready until Galore was published. As it turns out, I was disappointed, which is not to say River Thieves is not a very good book. It's just very different from The Wreckage. It is Michael Crummy's first novel. What disappointed me was that I had to really work to get into the book, unlike the Wreckage which had me hooked right from the beginning. That said, it is a very interesting novel, which takes place in the early 1800's in Newfoundland. Based on actual events, it concerns interactions between native indians, British settlers and Naval officials. It's set on the northeast coast, where the settlers fish in summer and trap in winter. The Navy is hoping to establish friendly relations between the two groups, both of whom depend on the same resources for their survival. Michael Crummy is a Newfoundlander and the dialogue between characters is rich in colloquialisms. It is an interesting window into a different time and place."}, {"userName": "Karolina Sosnowska", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33165867-karolina-sosnowska", "userReview": "https://tanayahczyta.wordpress.com/20..."}, {"userName": "Gerry Burnie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3715526-gerry-burnie", "userReview": "Gerry B's Book Reviews - http://gerrycan.wordpress.comMy bio reads in part: Canada has a rich and colourful history that for the most part is waiting to be discovered, and River Thieves by Michael Crummey [Anchor Canada, 2009] is a case on point.The Beothuk (pronounced \u201cbeo-thuk\u201d) people of Newfoundland, a.k.a. \u201cThe Red Indians\u201d because of the red ochre they smeared on their bodies, are truly one of the most fascinating and mysterious aspects of it. They are referred to as a \u201cpopulation isolate\u201d because they developed their unique culture in total isolation, starting around 1 A.D. until\u2014with the death of Shanawdithit (\u201cNancy April\u201d) in1829\u2014they were declared officially extinct.Part of the extinction process was as a result of being retreated into areas that could not sustain them; European diseases (particularly tuberculoses) for which they had no immunity; and anecdotes of genocide in which they were hunted like wolves. Indeed, the extinction of such a shy, peaceful and unique people is a black mark in Canadian history.All of this Michael Crummey has captured with remarkable insight, and a superb sense of time and place. His approach of fictionalizing historical events and persons (while not unique) is certainly affective in making them come to life in the context in which they existed, i.e. the rugged and austere wilderness of Newfoundland in the early nineteenth century.British naval officer, James Buchan, [a real historical figure] is sent to the British Colony of Newfoundland to establish productive relations with the mysterious aboriginals. In order to accomplish this mission he recruits the help of the Peyton family\u2014a sort of backwoods aristocracy led by the tough-minded John Peyton Sr., a ruthless Beothuk persecutor [yet another real individual and fact]. However, his son, John Jr., although dominated by his father, is also vested with a conscience and becomes Buchan\u2019s ally.Rounding off this complex household is Cassie Jure, the enigmatic housekeeper, who is surprisingly independent for a female servant of the 19th-century, but she nonetheless adds a feminine perspective to a dominant cast of men.Crummey\u2019s poetic style is a real boon here, for the setting is very much part of the story\u2014both the harshness and austere beauty of its topography and climate. He has therefore woven it into tapestry as though it were one of the characters, emphasizing the hardy resilience of its occupants\u2014like Joseph Reilly, a transported (\u201cexiled\u201d) Irish thief turned trapper. Likewise, his research and portrayal of 19th-century mores and terms gives it a solid credibility that invests the reader from beginning to end. For all these reasons, it is highly recommended. Five bees.***One of the historical events portrayed in this story is \u201cThe stealing of Demasduit (\u201cMary March\u201d).Demasduit was a Beothuk woman who is thought to have been about 23 years old when she was captured near Red Indian Lake in March 1819.The governor of Newfoundland, although seeking to encourage trade and end hostilities between the Beothuk and the English, had approved an expedition led by captain David Buchan to recover a boat and other fishing gear which had been stolen by the Beothuk. A group from this expedition was led by John Peyton Jr. whose father John Peyton Sr. was a salmon fisherman known for his hostility towards the small tribe. On a raid, they killed Demasduit\u2019s husband Nonosbawsut, then ran her down in the snow. She pleaded for her life, baring her breasts to show she was a nursing mother. They took Demasduit to Twillingate and Peyton earned a bounty on her. The baby died. Peyton was later appointed Justice of the Peace at Twillingate, Newfoundland.The British called Demasduit Mary March after the month when she was taken. Later bringing her to St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland, the colonial government wanted to give Desmaduit comfort and friendly treatment while she was with the English, hoping she might one day be a bridge between them and the Beothuk. Demasduit learned some English and taught the settlers about 200 words of Beothuk language. However, in January 1820 while making the trip back to Notre Dame Bay Demasduit died of tuberculosis before reaching her kin.

And that's a sad thing to realise after finishing a very satisfying read. It turns out that Michael Crummey is a respected poet and prose writer in Canada, winning many awards with River Thieves as well as with his poetry collections. I can see why.Set in the early part of the 1800s in Newfoundland (where Crummey is from), River Thieves is a sombre historical novel that charts the conflicts and misunderstandings between a group of tough settlers and the dwindling and mysterious Beothuk Indians. Bound to remote parts of the island, the Beothuk are like a people from a fantasy novel: entirely painted in red, remote and impossible to find, they entice search parties to go after them for the sake of a government wanting to create peace between the natives and the colonies. Who are the river thieves? Maybe they are the settlers who feel like they own the rivers and hunt natives who dare to interfere with their fishing. Or maybe they are the natives who are pushed into behaving like criminals in their own land by an expanding English colony that only sees them as a freakshow or gun target.River Thieves deserves to get an audience outside of Canada because it's not only beautifully written but it shows a part of Canadian history that many are not aware of. When I studied in Canada, I heard some Canadian friends say that their history was boring. Well, this book proves them wrong. The description of Newfoundland's harsh winter landscape and what the settlers and natives had to do to survive it is worth the read alone."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1722198-emily", "userReview": "I loved how Crummey told this story, moving around in time to weave a plot with surprises. In the process, several characters became more nuanced, and my assumptions disproved. He also told the story with continual reminders to the senses of this Newfoundland world: the cold, the ice, the mud, the flickering candles at night, the annoyance of flies in the summer, the smell of the chamber pot. I feel very lucky to have read this book. Shortly after finishing his newer book Galore, I realized I had purchased this book from the library's discarded book sale.

Crummey explores macroscopic themes of racism, genocide, classism, and wilderness survival by focusing microscopically on a three person household of an elderly father, his mid-20s son, and their housekeeper. Crummey writes with moral nuance about the actions and motives of each of his three main characters, as well as the young Scottish naval captain and the captive Beothuk young woman brought into the household. Crummey\u2019s at his best writing about the Newfoundland wilderness and the trapping, hunting, and fishing needed to survive in it. The current -12\u00b0C outside temperature where I\u2019m writing this makes Crummey\u2019s early nineteenth century Newfoundland winters feel all the more real.

This book allows you to experience this dark history. The Beothuk themselves are mainly on the periphery. Even when they are killed, the reader doesn't feel much for them because the author never really explores their perspective. They are represented as burial ground relics, or as a few tribesman who act inexplicably. Was this intentional? More interesting is the lives of the settlers who - spoiler alert - get away with murder, and for a moment, I wondered if the reader is actually expected to cheer for them. What this book lacked for me was any climactic moment.

No story of the decimation of first nation peoples will be easy to read, and it's to Crummey's credit that he does not sentimentalize the european characters, nor create a hollywood ending for the events he is retelling.Newfoundland is a harsh place to eek out an existence. Crummey is a master at conveying the isolation, the stark weather, the desperate circumstances that lead folks to choose that life, and the lengths that they will go to protect what they have invested in it, even at the expense of justice and the peoples that lived there before them.Q -- 3E -- 4I -- 33x4+3 = 15"}, {"userName": "Linda Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74397193-linda-johnson", "userReview": "While focus of plot is the story of families in Beothuk Newfoundland, I found the information about enterprise and commercial operations also informative."}, {"userName": "Dawn Nagata", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73421899-dawn-nagata", "userReview": "One of my all-time fave books.

It is populated by the fishermen and trappers who have settled there, and by the native Americans whose land it was before they came. One of the most prominent families are the Peytons. Peyton Senior has trapped and fished for many years. He left his family life in England behind to make a life in this new country. His son, John, is now grown and taking over the family businesses. They also have a housekeeper, Cassie, who came as John's tutor and stayed after he grew up. The British military is concerned about relations with the Native Americans. There have been incidents on both sides; the Indians stealing items from the frontiersmen to discourage them, and retaliation that leads to violence. The government decides to try to contact the remaining Indians and try to create a relationship with them. In order to do so, they need the help of the men who are involved in the strife between the two groups.  The novel details the lonely, difficult life each group leads while trying to survive in a bleak environment. Communication is strained, and the results are more incidents as each group tries to emerge as the stronger. A group of trappers mount an expedition into Indian territory and bring back a female captive. What occurs on the expedition and the government's response to it will have far-reaching consequences. Michael Crummey has written a fascinating historical fiction about life in a part of the North American continent many don't know that much about. River Thieves is his first novel and is a winner of the Bronwen Wallace Memorial Award. It was also a finalist for the Giller Prize, The Commonwealth Writers Prize and the Books In Canada First Novel Award. Readers will learn about Newfoundland and the people who settled there from England and France. This book is recommended for readers of historical fiction."}], "description": "River Thieves is a beautifully written and compelling novel that breathes life into the pivotal events which shaped relations between the Beothuk Indians of Newfoundland and European settlers. Following a series of expeditions made under the order of the British Crown, the reader witnesses the tragic fallout from these missions as the Beothuk vanish and the web of secrets guarded by the settlers slowly begin to unravel ... Told in elegant sensual prose this is an enthralling historical novel of great passion and suspense, driven by the extraordinary cast of characters. And with it Michael Crummey establishes himself as one of Canada's most exciting new talents.", "title": "River Thieves", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/296371.River_Thieves", "average": 3.87, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348122322l/296371.jpg", "reviews": 132, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/171079.Michael_Crummey", "name": "Michael Crummey"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/296371.River_Thieves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/998519.River_Thieves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29546665-rzeka-z-odziei", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/998524.River_Thieves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11257554-river-thieves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6276276-galore", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778574-sweetland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/296365.The_Wreckage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/296366.Hard_Light", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/296367.Flesh_Blood"]}
