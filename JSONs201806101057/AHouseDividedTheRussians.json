Anna and Sergei find themselves parted, Katrina is being courted by a controversial figure, and Anna and Paul's father, Yevno battles a failing heart.I enjoyed this slightly more than the first book, but this is a fairly clean description of the conflict between the Romanov leader and his subjects. However, this is a Christian historical romance which is light on the history and heavy on the romance. Again it is the curiousity of seeing everything play out and the short chapters that pushes me to keep on going."}, {"userName": "Tirzah Eleora", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39336161-tirzah-eleora", "userReview": "Enjoyable, although certain plot lines were terribly clich\u00e9 and cheesy.

I could not put this book down. One thing I really liked about it is the fact that it is in a time period neglected by historical fiction, and history in general. It is always passed up for the more exciting Bolshevik Revolution 30-odd years later, so I found the historical tidbits quite interesting, and it helped me understand better the volatile state of Russia under the Tsar Liberator. The characters are quite well developed, too, and I liked that a significant portion of the story happens in Anna's home village, which was not the case in the first book."}, {"userName": "Gracelyn Buckner", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63411712-gracelyn-buckner", "userReview": "5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Rachel McMillan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2201736-rachel-mcmillan", "userReview": "Re-read"}, {"userName": "Priscilla", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6539745-priscilla", "userReview": "Starting to realize how awesome this series is!

Book 2 in the series was entertaining and picked right up where book 1 left off. I love reading the Russian history and found it very interesting. Katrina and Anna are grown women now and each has someone they love and hoping to plan a future with.I don't mind a little bit of romance in the books I read, but there was much more in this book than the last and it had some cheesy moments. What I most enjoyed reading about were the conflicts between the aristocratic Romanov family and the peasant rebels who fight against them. Good book and well written, but I liked the first one better!"}, {"userName": "Ekaterina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39570311-ekaterina", "userReview": "Ok, so I really liked the book, but there was some things that made me not want to give a 4 star rating. First of all, the second book didn't really compare to the first book. I don't know why I didn't like the second book as much. The book was still really good. There were some inaccuracies that I didn't like. In Russia, they don't celebrate mass. Instead of mass, it's called a liturgy, which is a big difference because mass gives the connotation that Russia is Catholic, when it is actually an Orthodox Christian nation. I also felt like some of the story line was extremely unrealistic, especially for the time period. I half disliked it, and half didn't mind it because I was looking for an easy read anyways. I loved reading about the rest of the characters. I liked Katrina's change in character, and watching the relationship between Anna and Sergei grow. I loved those parts. :-)"}, {"userName": "Shala Self Parker", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53045630-shala-self-parker", "userReview": "Another great book in this series. I can't wait to start the next book. This book gave us more insight into the main characters' lives.

I am not sure if I was just reading too quickly, but it seemed to me that many big details about some of the characters were left out and I had to fill in the blanks myself.

The reason I read this so quickly was that I had such hopes for those two. But finally, when I was almost finished with this book, I could take the suspense no longer and checked on the following books to see who Anna would choose. She chooses Sergei. Ruined! I skipped through several parts at the end, and I won\u2019t read the next books. The fact that she could fall for Sergei, who was still such a weak character, (and the fact that their love story was just so underdeveloped!) really makes me dislike these authors. A love story with Misha would have had so much more depth, intrigue, and heartache. They don\u2019t know how to create a truly beautiful love story, frankly. A prince falling for a servant should be one of the most romantic tales in the world, but somehow they butchered it. They made Misha so much cooler, and they didn\u2019t even realize it. Some good parts, like when Anna came to Misha for help with Dmitri --- yet overall a disappointment, because she chose the uninteresting character over the great one.

It was less political and more character and events driven. While there is still little mystery as to the events that will happen or how those events will occur, the book is compelling and keeps the reader invested in the character's lives. I greatly preferred the events surrounding Anna and Katrina to those involving Paul. His character is not developed enough to feel the conflict I should towards him and his associates are equally lacking in compelling characteristics. As a result, Paul's parts in the story were not nearly as interested has Anna's. Overall, I've enjoyed this series and look forward to its conclusion."}, {"userName": "Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3070362-lindsey", "userReview": "The plot moved between Anna and Katrina and what was happening in their lives. Anna's father getting sick and her brother Paul coming to the city. Katrina with the news that Dmitri was engaged, finding a \"boyfriend\" and her brother Sergei leaving the home to \"find himself.\" I would have liked to see more of Sergei...but there was a more concrete villain in this book then the last. Lots more political undercurrents and upheaval.

I adored the book and entire series then. This remembered adoration helped me make the decision to skip these books when reading through my collection four years ago. I read many books by both of these authors since then and gradually became aware of the glaringly obvious shortcomings of their authorship. These shortcomings infected every book I read by them.
