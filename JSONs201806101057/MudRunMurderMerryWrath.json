As usual, this author came up aces once again. I absolutely love Merry, Rex and Riley, and we can't forget the cats, Philby (aka Hitler-doppelganger) and Martini! Merry has to be the funniest ex-CIA agent I have ever read about and she is so great with her young Girl Scout troop. I think I could read a book a day in this series and never tire of it.

The most hilarious scenes in the book involved either the cats (trying to feed Philby her medicine was glorious) or the Girl Scouts (the laser range against the Boy Scouts was great, but so were the speeches at the beginning of the mud run). This book also made some headway in the love triangle. Though love triangles can add some suspense to the sexual tension between two characters, I am rather wary of them, because of two series. One is Stephanie Plum (Janet Evanovich), which I stopped reading after book 20, because I just couldn't take it anymore. Just resolve the damn thing, give them a split personality and have Ranger and Morelli be the same person for all I care. The second one is Kathleen Turner (Tiffany Snow). In this series it was obvious that she was going to end up with Kade, as he needed her more (which incidentally is also why Blaine let her go). It wasn't just the unnecessary drama that ruined this love triangle, but reading how 10 years later Blaine was still pining for her, never allowed himself to move on and was absolutely miserable. The only person completely oblivious to the fact that Riley still had feelings for her is Merry. After the reveal that he never cheated on her in the last book, she is conflicted about her own emotions, to say the least (lack of closure). Having Rex propose to Merry in this book and Kelly (as well as Maria) telling her that Riley was going to as well, doesn't bode well for the series.The weakest part was actually the case itself. The problem wasn't so much the conclusion, but the fact that Riley had to make a series of dumb mistakes to kick of this chain of events. Starting with writing a book about Merry's career and including some very sensitive information. Are we to believe that he was so hung up on Merry that he wrote a book, in which he gave their relationship a happy ending? And using a Hollywood movie to expose state secrets? Even if the intro says that this movie was based on a true story, nobody would take it seriously, because movies are supposed to be entertaining not accurate. That part didn't work for me at all. The revelation how they kept tabs on Merry in the end was great fun again.Overall I would give this 3,5 stars. Great fun, but mediocre plot."}, {"userName": "Barbara Hackel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32992108-barbara-hackel", "userReview": "When Finnoughla Merrygold Czrygy was outed by the vice president, she had to leave the CIA. Her cover was blown, so she settled in Who's There, Iowa and took her mother's maiden name, becoming Merry Wrath. Since that time, trouble has found her as if she never left the Agency. So it was with extreme delight that she found the pizza guy murdered in his car across the street where her boyfriend (a police detective) lives. Not. Her. House. Or. Problem. Of course the celebration was short lived, because of course everything suspicious connects up with Merry!In a moment of loneliness Merry decides to go to a movie and happens on one called Spy Diary. Partway through the film she realises that every move, every case made by the star is a move or case from her own past history. When the movie is stopped abruptly and pulled from theaters nationwide, she has the inkling she is in trouble. Does the Agency think she wrote this movie? In a heartbeat she is calling in favors trying to find out what has happened.Meanwhile the scout troup signs up for a mud run course, and decides to challenge a boy scout team with a laser game at the mall. Intending to use it as a bonding experience prior to the mud run, Merry agrees to the plan. Only when they get there it is her 3rd grade troup against 15 and 16 year old boys. With the assistance of Dr. Body (yes, the coroner's actual name) they have a plan...I have a plan too! It is to reread ALL of this series as soon as possible because I LOVED this book so much. I laughed until my eyes watered. I laughed at the cats and their escapades. I laughed at Merry. I laughed at the girl scouts. I laughed at Dr. Body. I even laughed at baby Finn. Ah...got to love a book and author that leaves you feeling so good! Don't miss this book!! And if you are new to the series (WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN???) you need to start at the beginning and read them all in order. L.L. you are the best! Can't wait to see what happens next, especially with R."}, {"userName": "Diane Burton", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6952559-diane-burton", "userReview": "When I finished Book 4 in this series, I had to buy this one. (The first chapter included in the back of that book intrigued me so much, I had to find out what happened next. Good marketing ploy. LOL) I've become addicted to Merry Wrath's adventures. Or should I say misadventures? This one starts with a more serious situation--Merry goes to the movies and sees her CIA career splashed across the screen. Holy smoke! Even though she didn't leak any classified info, her former employer thinks she did. The two people in the agency she trusts won't return her calls. That's scary enough. A dead guy in her bedroom adds to her worries. But all that isn't enough to take her mind off the Mud Run her troop enters. Who can resist the prize of an all-paid trip to the best camp in the Girl Scout Council?As always in this series, the characters are the best part. The girls in Merry & Kelly's troop steal the show. They are smarter and cleverer than eight-year-olds should be. A new parent, Kelly has gotten stricter in her insistence on fair play and no cheating. Merry's boyfriend Rex wants to up their relationship. And her former CIA handler (and best friend) has grown weirder. A few good surprises and twists add to the enjoyment of this book. Is it the end of the Merry Wrath series? I hope not. (Right now, my book budget can take a breather.)"}, {"userName": "Merry Chapman", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47513806-merry-chapman", "userReview": "Laugh out loud mystery that grabs you when you start! Can't wait for the next one!This series just keeps getting funnier and funnier! Trouble always seems to find Merry Wrath a retired CIA agent who is hiding out in Who's There, Iowa. Dead bodies seem to find her anyway. With the help of her former handler, Riley and her boyfriend, a policeman in town, Rex, she has always managed to catch the murderers. This time is different since she goes alone to a movie and sees her classified life splayed out on the screen. Who could have know all this and leaked all this secret classified material and why are there dead bodies showing up in her boyfriend's driveway and in her own house. Can she trust anyone in the CIA and why do they think she is the leak, are they coming after her? And can Rex help her since he is on the case? And her girl scout troup, can they win the Mud Run these little girls with incredibly sneaky minds?

To her total surprise and angst, her career as a CIA agent is being played out on the screen. Which can possibly get her significant prison time as her career is still classified. With another murder Merry and one of her cats being kidnapped, and the girl scout troupe using some very clever maneuvers to win an obstacle course in which Merry is still being attacked. Meanwhile Merry has to decide what she wants for her life as far as moving her relationship with Rex to the next level, or deciding what she wants for or with Riley. Leslie wrote a fun story that has lots of action and humor in it. In my opinion it was the weakest of the stories in that several procedural protocols for investigating were either not followed, or flat out broken. There are hints for the next book that will bring back a very lively character from a previous story, and promises to be very entertaining."}, {"userName": "Sherry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3975309-sherry", "userReview": "Hail, Hail the Gangs All Here!! The Merry Wrath books are always tons of fun & highly addicting. In Mud Run Murder Merry is back in another action packed, laugh filled adventure. This time Merry has to deal with the dead bodies that keep piling up both human & animal, her current boyfriend Rex wanting to take their relationship to the next level, old boyfriend/handler Riley's betrayal, & competing in a mud run with her 3rd grade group of Girl Scouts. As the plot thickens & becomes more entangled I couldn't stop laughing at some of the bizarre situations Merry gets herself into, especially her first babysitting job with goddaughter Finn - the cats & diapers are to die for! Her Girl Scout pack is so diabolical! Definitely future operatives in the making.

I was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my high hopes. The case was very confusing and not very thought out. I also felt like it felt the passion of earlier cases.Merry once again suspected Riley of wrongdoing, something she does in almost every book, only to be proven wrong. Added to that her continued denial of figuring out her feelings for him, instead fleeing into her boring relationship with Rex, whose proposal she accepts. There is no other scene with Riley after that, so we're kept hanging.Also, it turns out one beloved character is a traitor. Do we get a closure on any of this? No.So yeah, I'm disappointed. And hope she gets back to her wits in the next one - and ends this love triangle. Of course in Riley's favor."}, {"userName": "Mike Cullen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13703382-mike-cullen", "userReview": "Mud Run Murder was another excellent and highly enjoyable entry in the Merry Wrath Murders.
