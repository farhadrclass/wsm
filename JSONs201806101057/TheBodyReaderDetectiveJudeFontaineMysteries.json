I have never written anything by Anne Frasier before but that clearly is where my life has been lacking, she is a very skilled author that managed to engage me fully as a reader. This is a book that I highly recommend for anybody's to-read list!Detective Jude Fontaine is the star of this novel. A Detective who has been abducted, held prisoner, subjected to horrific mental and physical torture in a lonely and empty place for 3 years. She is damaged goods on every level. However, she is one strong woman. I loved her character, loved Jude through the entire book as the story moves with her and keeps you hanging on for more. Isolation, terror and fear have given Jude the unique ability to \"read\" people exceptionally well when she finally finds her freedom again and returns to her role in the Homicide team that had all but given up hope of finding her alive. She claims to be able to smell, sense and just know things about the dead and the living. Her new partner Detective Uriah Ashby is not so sure of her mental state and the book cleverly allows us also to walk a fine line between what we know and believe.The book switches between back then (captive Jude) and now (Jude seeking justice for the dead) and it makes for really intriguing reading. I was totally engrossed from page one and how could you not be as the opening pages are brilliant! Gosh how I love a well-written damaged character and Jude is certainly that, I felt like I knew her personally by the time I had caught my breath after an absolutely nail-biting, harrowing and surprising ending with awesome reveals! Murder is in the air, can Jude stay steady after all she has been through to do her job well? You will need to read this great book to find out for yourself, you won't be bored for one second. It's gritty and fast paced with so much going for it, thrills and twists that had me loving every single word. It's quality writing on so many levels and I can't do anything but give it 5 glowing stars as I really loved this book. It's a book with some depth and that is something I personally enjoy a lot. Bravo!I received an advance copy of this novel to read and review thanks to Thomas & Mercer via NetGalley, many thanks for the opportunity. Publication date is 21 June 2016, don't forget to pre-order if you like the sound of this one!Thanks for reading my review!

I opened this one last night, and finished it very early this morning. It's a headlong read, with a very unusual POV character. YOu know how much I hate spoilers, so I won't give away more than the book does on the back jacket or indeed within the first pages. Jude Fontaine, a police detective, was abducted three years ago. Her sadistic jailer has kept her alive in horrific conditions. Jude has survived my shutting down her emotions. When she does attain her freedom, this tale gives a very realistic depiction of all she goes through in attempting to find and resume her life and decide who she is now.I think what most fascinated me about this book was the character Jude. I felt a mixture of horror and sympathy for her. I could not stop reading until the tale was done."}, {"userName": "Amina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina", "userReview": "Warning: The title is misleading, there is no body reading in this book..Jude is a homicide detective who got kidnapped and kept in small basement cell for three years with only her persecuter for contact, something that did enhance her senses and her ability to read people, dead or alive (you won't see much of that). One day, during a city blackout, she manages to escape.. Her life isn't the same anymore.. She makes it back to the homicide department and starts working on a case that will lead to some kind of serial killing that would bring some bad shit out.. Things I liked: - The plot- The twists- Uriah- The cat- The endThings I didn't like:- This book is about 300 pages that could have been reduced to 200 or less.- Too much useless details that had absolutely nothing to do with the cases.- It was more of a Jude's pseudo-diary than a thriller.- It gets dull from time to time (too often)- It wasn't exactely what I had in mind when I picked up the book.It was not as bad as the \"things I didn't like\" makes it seem, but if you're looking for a really thrilling thriller, do not pick that book :)"}, {"userName": "Anne Goldschrift", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13592607-anne-goldschrift", "userReview": "Na das war doch mal ein wirklich fesselnder Thriller, auch wenn ich den Kritikern zustimmen muss, die sagen, dass Jude Smokey Barrett und Kate Burkholder \u00e4hnelt.

I can't stop thinking about it. The Body Reader. See, now you have it too!So, with that out of the way, I have to say I really liked this. It's dark. It's interesting. There are so many layers to the story, to the mystery. It's never what you think it is. I've never read anything by Anne Frasier before, though I do have a few of her books on my TBR shelf. I will definitely be moving those books closer to the top of the list. Det. Jude Fontaine makes a daring escape after 3 years in captivity. She's not herself anymore. She's been subjected to unknown tortures and horrors. She sees everything in the world with new eyes, including herself. Clawing her way back to some semblance of mental health, Jude goes back to work as a Homicide detective, while trying to find new ways to just be alive. (Sleeping on the roof, for instance.) Everything about Jude is switched off after her return. She has no sense of humour, she is flat and unemotional. She doesn't know how to exist anymore. And this starting point requires the other to have some A+ character development. It's got to be believable, yet on pace with the rest of the book so you don't feel bogged down with \"personal issues\". I think Frasier really pulled that off. (This needs to be a series.)Her partnership with Det. Ashby, as well as Jude's undeniable strength and character development, are what really made this novel for me. I was engaged with the mystery, but not as much as I was with their interactions, and Jude's interaction with life itself. It was captivating and gripping (and I wish this was a series!)At times, the plot felt a bit disconnected as I couldn't see how the crimes were connected. It felt like it jumped around a bit too much, with the only thing tying it together being Jude's issues. Are we investigating Jude's abduction, or the dead girl? Or the head in the helmet? Like what's the deal with her father and brother? The link between all of these could have been a little bit more visible; bread crumbs should have been a bit more obvious, as not to lose the reader along the way. In the end all threads were tied together, and I was left with a feeling of closure and satisfaction for where Jude's character was left in her growth. (But still, again, make it a series)4/5 would bang.NetGalley suggestion to Publisher will be: \"Make this a series.\" book source: Thomas & Mercer, via NetGalley, in exchange for a review."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32081931-lisa", "userReview": "I am afraid I may be in the minority here but The Body Reader by Anne Frasier did absolutely nothing for me it started okay & got my interest, but I found the plot a bit hard to believe she is held captive raped tortured doesn't know who she is, turns up at the Boston P.D where she used to work dishevelled broken bones etc then further on she has her full memory back then starts her job as nothing has happened.Meh it was just a read nothing to get excited about sorry guys.

I spent the day reading it and didn't want to put it down.This story starts out strong with Jude making an escape after 3 years of being held captive to a sadistic criminal. I was immediately pulled into the story and the strong female character of Jude. After 3 years of captivity she is not your typical heroine, but she shows strength and grit as she returns to a semblance of normal life.In her before captivity life she was a detective in the homicide department of a police department. After a few months of rehab and a mental health check she is brought back in the department. Her partner, Uriah, isn't too thrilled with the match and is unsure if she should be back as a detective, specifically in homicide. However, their partnership is one of the best aspects of this book. This is not a romance novel. This is two people, each with a past trauma affecting them, trying to form a professional relationship with the other person. Uriah is one of the best parts of the book. I really liked his character and although his back story was sad, it was a strong story that created who he is today. The name of the book \"The Body Reader\" implies more body reading ability than what really happens in the book. I wasn't excited by this aspect of the book, glad it was limited and that the book really focused on the characters and the murder mystery plot. Character development was really good as was the mystery plot.This was my first book by Anne Frasier and I really liked it. I also really liked the characters of Jude and Uriah and would love to read more books with them in it.Thanks to Thomas & Mercer via NetGalley for an advanced copy in exchange for a honest review."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24770184-sandy", "userReview": "This is a story that grabs your attention from the get-go.Jude Fontaine used to be an easy going homicide detective. That was before she was abducted & endured 3 years of abuse at the hands of a madman. So when she finally escapes & gets her old job back, it should be all good, right? Well\u2026..This fast paced police procedural is not for the squeamish. We follow Jude & her partner Uriah Ashby as they investigate the fallout from depravity run amok. It\u2019s a tough job on a good day & neither has had one of those in a long time. As a result of her ordeal, Jude has become detached & lacking in social skills. Uriah is her emotional opposite. He\u2019s still reeling from the loss of his wife & struggles to keep a lid on everything he feels. As the story progresses, both will uncover family secrets that force them to question just how well they knew those closest to them.Though events that occur are horrific in nature the author doesn\u2019t dwell on gruesome details & allows the reader\u2019s imagination to fill in the blanks. Some of the bad guys will trigger your spidey senses immediately while others may take you by surprise when all is revealed. It makes for a satisfying police procedural but it\u2019s the relationship between the MC\u2019s that guarantees you become invested in the the story.

So I looked up the german title of the translation and it said \"Ich bin nicht tot\", meaning in english \"I am not dead\". Maybe they should have taken this title instead.

Prior to being abducted, she was a detective on her local police force, and after a few months of rehab, she returns to work. Her new partner Uriah isn't thrilled. He doesn't trust that she's ready to be back working on murder cases after such a short time being back in \"the real world\". Despite his protests, they are partnered, and begin working a case regarding a string of murdered girls. Having been held captive for so long, Jude has perfected the art of \"reading\" facial expressions and body movements, and uses this to her advantage while working these cases. As she continues to investigate, the danger around her grows. I did enjoy this book, but not as much as I was hoping I would. I was hoping for more \"body reading\" going into it, given the title and description, and I found that aspect of it lacking. I do think it set the base foundation and understanding for the reader, so that if the author chose to write sequels with the same characters, it would be set up nicely. I'd love reading more about what Jude can learn and understand from people (and even victims) using that particular skill of hers. Otherwise, I felt like Jude and Uriah both were well developed characters, which I loved. I liked that the book jumped between Jude narrating the present and the past while she was held captive. I loved the twists the book took, and I thought the ending was great! I will say that I didn't feel a whole lot of tension as I was reading the book - that \"oh my gosh, what's going to happen\" feeling was lacking for me, though that's not necessarily a bad thing. If you're looking for that heart pounding suspense, you won't find it here.

Slowly, Frasier unfurls Jude's past, while setting her on the path for her future, post captivity.What else is this about?: Jude is set on trying to find out why she was picked and kept hostage, and realises that ties into a case of missing girls she had only just begun to investigate. Her \"body reader\" talent is less a part of this than the title would lead you to believe.First, I had high hopes for this -- the thought of someone taking a character kept in captivity and exploring how she'd changed, beyond the obvious, was compelling. And it made perfect sense that this change would be about a cop's perceptions and her awareness.But. But. The book falls short -- in truth, it never really gets started on this aspect of Jude's character. And, as I began to read this book, I began to wonder: what exactly is the difference between Jude's new talent before being held captive and after? Isn't a cop supposed to notice smells and body language as it is?But, let me get to the story: Jude escapes her captivity and returns to her life as a cop -- along with a new partner. Everything about her is switched off, flat -- and by the nature of what she's gone through, that makes sense. She's trying to figure out how to react to things and people anew and it's not going to be easy. The problem is, this flatness is a constant through the narrative until literally the last page, which makes for a boring thriller. I needed progression, I needed something more than an aborted attempt to move back to her ex's house and try again. Don't get me wrong, there are other times she tries to be normal and there's a hint of the struggle she's going through, but mostly she's just flat.It's Uriah, her partner, that interested me more, than had most of the emotional oomph in this that appealed to me. He's trying to put his life back together after he lost his wife, and he's not doing it well. He's hiding it well from everyone, but he's struggling to keep himself together and help Jude, even if she may not want it. They're an odd couple, but they work because of Uriah.I suppose there's an emotional connection tried for in including Jude's family in this too, but it too falls flat. For one, because the only emotion she can muster for them is hatred.This would be a fine thriller, I suppose, if it was packaged as something unique with a title like The Body Reader. It's as if the title was an attempt to make a fairly straightforward and normal thriller into something unique for the slimmest of reasons shown in the plot."}, {"userName": "Kira", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7247640-kira", "userReview": "4.5 starsI liked this even more the second time despite remembering how it ended. Jude was kidnapped and held captive in horrid conditions for 3 years. When she finally escapes she isn't what anyone expected. Clearly she wasn't normal. She was emotionally repressed with good reason. The most alarming thing about her was how independent and capable she was. I liked being inside her head. Her behavior was weird but it made sense.Uriah was a great partner for Jude. They both had their issues although they were completely different. They complemented each other nicely. Uriah's depression and determination to keep going clicked with me. I loved these two characters and their relationship.

With no contact with any other human being than that man, her survival reflexes made her learn to \"read\" him, in order to stay alive. After she seizes an opportunity to escape, she realises she has retained this ability to \"read\" other people, booth the living and the dead: even a frozen corpse will still \"talk\" to her, in its expression, the way its fists are closed, and so on. As she's trying to go back to her former career as a cop, Jude understands she can use this newfound skill to make things right.Excellent idea, but one that I thought wasn't exploited enough throughout the story: we are made to see June \"read\" her new partner first, then \"read\" a corpse, yet nothing much happens in that regard after that, and it's like the body-reading concept got lost along the way, along a more \"traditional\" thriller story. This was rather too bad, as I would have enjoyed seeing more of Jude's ability, things that would truly set her apart from \"just yet another very talented cop\".Another problem I had with the story was the moments when Jude tried to figure out how to go back to a normal life, or even if she could: a new flat, maybe getting back with her boyfriend, her tense relationship with her family... All interesting things, but presented in too descriptive a way, rendered too flat: I didn't \"feel\" her predicament, I simply read about it, and it just wasn't the same. I felt more connected to Uriah, who had his own emotional struggles to contend with, but here too the whole thing was more descriptive, not vibrant enough.Finally, the ending was too neatly wrapped, too quickly, without the kind of intensity I'd expect from the last chapters of a thriller. I could also sense the places where the story was trying to mislead me, yet at the same time the lack of involvement (or, should I rather say, the sideline involvement) of some characters gave a few things away.I did like, though, how Jude, even though toughened and emotionally withdrawn, went about getting back control of her life by doing something useful, like picking up cold cases, and how the author didn't fall into the typical trappings of adding some romantic twist in there. Sure, there's the boyfriend, but this side plot is never presented as an end in itself, never touted as \"Jude's salvation in the arms of a man\", or whatever similar tripe. In the same vein, Jude and Uriah give off a definite \"work partners and perhaps friends someday\" vibe, not a \"and perhaps lovers someday\" one.2 stars: I quite liked some of the themes here, but this remains an \"OK\" book and nothing more, because it fell flat for me, and because its ideas weren't developed enough compared to what the blurb had made me expect."}, {"userName": "FHG", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38707144-fhg", "userReview": "Makes the Addams family seem normal!!!This book had so many twists and turns.

I really hope this becomes a series with a book 2 coming out very soon and that I get a partner romance scene."}, {"userName": "Xavier (CharlesXplosion)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37025883-xavier-charlesxplosion", "userReview": "Another by-the-numbers crime procedural featuring dull/lifeless characters and an uninspired plot.

Frasier introduces us to Detective Jude Fontaine on the night she escapes captivity from an underground cell that held her for three years. The tale that unfolds was riveting as she and her new partner Homicide Detective Uriah Ashby work a case involving missing woman.The Body Reader offered several threads beginning with the impact the past three years have had on Jude. It has changed her personal life and the way she views cases, particularly bodies. This thread does not have any paranormal aspects but focuses on her \"heightened senses.\"The second thread involves missing girls, possible suicides, and cases Jude had previously been working. Young woman are going missing, others are committing suicide, and there a number of unsolved cases. . Fontaine\u2019s ability to read bodies alerts her that a recent suicide involves foul play. An old photograph discovered in her personal effects and a thumb drive soon have Jude suspecting a serial killer. The author provided a tightly written mystery that felt genuine. I admired how effortlessly Frasier weaved all the threads together.Other threads dealt with Jude\u2019s childhood, and her family as we watching the developing friendship with her new partner. What developed from these threads was an engaging well-rounded tale that I devoured in just two sittings. If it were not for sleep, I probably would have read it in one.Frasier did a wonderful job of fleshing out the characters and creating an authentic partnership between Detectives Ashby and Fontaine. They work well together and I enjoyed seeing them progress from strangers to full-fledge partners. There is no romantic element in the Body Reader but the relationship between Fontaine and Ashby allowed readers to experience an emotional connection.My complaints are minor and none deterred from my reading experience. I would have liked to learning more about her captivity and her capture. A prequel would be nice. Also I am kind of bummed we won't get any other cases featuring Detectives Fontaine and Ashby. Yes I know I was delighted this was a standalone, and now I am bitching because I want more. What can I say?

This type of book may have you up all night reading straight through because the story is gripping and riveting. It reads like an episode of Law and Order or CSI, and has a gritty type atmosphere. It\u2019s also depressing and heartbreaking because of what has happened to the female protagonist, and how her life has been destroyed, ruined and turned upside down because of a sick individual intent on doing her harm, as well as other young women.Jude was once a police detective. Three years ago she was kidnapped and placed in a cage in a basement, constantly degraded, tortured and rape by a stranger. She has no idea why this man took her and treats her worse than a dog. One day her captor got lazy, and she grabbed his taser and tasered the sick perverted puppy. She also ends up killing him. She has escaped her nightmare and darkness, but her life has been destroyed. Her boyfriend is no longer hers, her job is gone, and her hair has turned completely white. But she has a new skill. She has a heightened sense of smell, and by reading the features on someone\u2019s face, she knows what they\u2019re thinking, and if they are lying.Four months after Jude escaped, she\u2019s back at her old job but handled with extreme care. Her new partner, Uriah isn\u2019t sure what to make of her. Jude shows no real emotion or personality that makes him want to work with her. Uriah has some trauma in his past also. His wife killed herself, and he takes the blame over it. But he still has to work, and soon Jude and him are working a new case. Young women have been found drowned around the city. Jude thinks there\u2019s more to these murders that meets the eye. Also, Jude\u2019s kidnapper still hasn\u2019t been caught, and the reason she was taken is still unsolved. Not only will she try to figure out why she was a victim, but also find he killer or killers targeting young girls, who now may now target Jude because she\u2019s getting close to solving the case.The Body Reader is a tense filled read. There are many characters that pop up to add to the story, such as Jude\u2019s new landlord, her co-workers she used to work with prior to her kidnapping, her ex-boyfriend who may want her back, and that of her brother and her father, the mayor, both of which she is estranged from. Jude\u2019s past comes full circle regarding the crime against her, which intersects with these murdered and missing women. It may or may not go back to the death of Jude\u2019s mother.The mystery and questions regarding Jude and her current case are on-going until the very end, which may come as a surprise to some readers. I did figure out a part of it early on, but I was still surprised by the villain\u2019s motivation and actions.The Body Reader may make your heart jump in your chest and have you locking all your windows and doors at night. I also think this is a good first book in what I hope will become a series starring Jude. A must read for mystery suspense fans. Also this isn\u2019t a romance."}, {"userName": "Joanne Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25524955-joanne-robertson", "userReview": "I read an older book by Anne Fraser last year called Hush and I immediately knew that she was an author I could trust to give me that creepy, suspense filled thriller with an edge. So I was very excited to get an ARC of The Body Reader and settled down to read it.....and I didn't stop!This book is unlike the usual romantic suspense that I tend to go for by my favourite U.S. authors. There is a strong relationship between Jude and her partner Uriah but it doesn't cross that barrier and go into a full on \"will they won't they\" romance. And that's why this book works so well, it's a realistic relationship between two loners based on trust and mutual respect.\"One day she stopped screaming\". That opening sentence throws us into this book with a shocking bang! Jude has been held captive for a long time but she has taken that time to learn. She uses her senses when she sees her chance to escape and that's when she realises how long she has been gone. Lots has changed for Jude, her previous life is gone but her job as a police officer offers her a chance of a new start. Using those honed senses that she evolved during her captivity, she brings a different perspective to solving crimes, crimes that may or may not be related to what happened to Jude herself.This is a great story that felt very different to things that I've read recently. Jude is a strong and feisty female character who had been to hell and back but has hardened herself and built a protective shell around her emotions. I loved the way she evolved with the little glimpses we had of her vulnerability. Whereas many women would hide away, Jude faced her fears head on, never giving up, never breaking down. Her friendship with Uriah seemed based on a mutual respect for one others inner demons and it felt very realistically relaxed and not forced. The plot itself is a belter and the way it is told, with flashbacks to a girl being held captive by a masked man, gives plenty of twists and unexpected turns. It's dark and absorbing and gave me goosebumps with its creepy male characters. Once you pick it up you will struggle to let go until you get to the end. I love this authors standalone books but she also has a great series featuring Detective Elise Sandburg which you should also check out if you're a fan of this dark and gothic style of thriller.I received a copy of this book via netgalley in return for an unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Phyllis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1018828-phyllis", "userReview": "\"One day she stopped screaming.\" With these chilling words, the reader is plunged into the nightmare world of Jude Fontaine. For three hellish years, Jude Fontaine has been the prisoner of a sadistic captor. Filthy, starved, and beaten, she barely clings to her sense of self. Then for one moment, she has an opportunity to escape. But freedom is difficult. Her boyfriend has moved on. Her partner on the police force doesn\u2019t think Jude is mentally fit for police duty. Just maintaining an aura of normalcy can be a challenge for Jude. \tThen the body of a missing teen is found. What looks like a drowning accident is murder. Then another teen girl is found dead. Someone from Jude\u2019s past is connected to the murders. The investigation will bring Jude face to face with old demons and challenge her sanity. \t\tAuthor Anne Fraiser has created the most believable story about the mental and physical torment of a kidnap victim. Jude Fontaine is a mesmerizing heroine. Despite the physical and emotional abuse of her kidnapper, she struggles to survive. After escaping, she fights to take control of her life. But she is no victim. She is a kickass heroine. She is the best female character since The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. \tHowever, this novel is much better written than Stieg Larrson\u2019s debut novel. As with all of Fraiser\u2019s novels, there is amazing depth to the secondary characters. In particular, the mother of a missing teen girl resonates with humanity. The plot twists and turns. There are betrayals. In the end, I was left wanting to read more about Jude and her partner, Uriah Ashby."}], "description": "For three years, Detective Jude Fontaine was kept from the outside world.
