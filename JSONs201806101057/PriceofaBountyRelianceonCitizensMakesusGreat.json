Please note, this book is not my normal genre, and I was hesitant at first about reading it, but I am very glad I did. To summarize, this is the story of a world changed, a world where Terene is dominated by the government and the lower classes are left to fend for themselves, to do without good medical treatment, and who must depend on the Elite/the upper class for their survival.Price of a Bounty follows four main characters: Keira, Scott, Guy, and April. I love books written in first person, but I will admit that I am fairly intimidated by first person point of view when it switches back and forth between characters. Each chapter in this book is the first person account of one of these four characters. That said, and my intimidation with this method revealed, I must point out that this book did SO well in this respect that I was never confused. This is the first time reading a book that switched between characters that I have not been frustrated with point of view change. I never got lost and confused. You have no idea what a big deal that is for me. The story itself was fantastic. Very well developed. In a book like this, an author who writes about a world this different from our own has to put a lot of work into setting up governments, class divisions, institutions without being over descriptive. This is not an easy task, and is often not done well. I was impressed with Wallace's ability to do this. She made it seem effortless, and her world spoke to me. By the end of the book, I was part of Wallace's world, I was a part of her characters' lives, and I was wishing desperately to be a part of the Resistance. And let's not forget that, as a huge romantic, this story has romance! I loved that. I also loved that she developed the conflicting emotions of each character so well. I felt everything they felt. That is important in a story. For the first time in a long time, I have not been disappointed treking into new territory, into a genre that I tend to overlook. I highly recommend this book. I have a bad tendency not to review books that I couldn't get into while I review the ones I love. I know I need to review both. This book is among the books I enjoyed immensely. I am still surprised by how much I enjoyed it. That is a credit to Wallace. I look forward to it's sequel."}, {"userName": "Katherine Rochholz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8117482-katherine-rochholz", "userReview": "I quite enjoyed that book, I generally don't read a lot or write a lot with different POV, so I was surprised how I truly enjoyed this one, most of the time I can be left feeling confused and lost. But this book is written very well. There are a few spots where see a lot of repeated information, but I didn't mind this very much. It was fast paced and kept me flipping the pages. I still really don't the multiple POV and wish it would have been done in 3rd person but that being said that really doesn't distract one from the story line and the plot, which is great! I love the characters and I love the storyline. Some of the wording seemed a bit redundant or a bit forced, but that can be easily overlooked.

Wallace's trilogy, is about a dystopian future in which the Resistance steals from the rich in order to help the poor: Robin Hood with more violence, basically, and better technology. This is not a favorable comparison; I cheered for the Sheriff of Nottingham.The first thing that annoys me about Price Of A Bounty is the poor formatting. While things look all right in Amazon's Kindle for PC software, some kind of error or oversight on the formatter's part puts a blank line between every paragraph on my Kindle, which is where I do ninety-something percent of my reading.The point of view, which is always first person, changes with every section or chapter; a different character describes or tells me what happened just a few pages previously, if that far back. Lots of these repetitions, especially in the first half of the ebook or so, include copied-and-pasted dialogue that I just read a few pages back.As the book progresses, the copy-paste jobs taper off and I start to see how the POV decisions Wallace made are useful. Too bad she didn't edit the earlier parts to reflect what she'd learned as she kept writing. Still, I think I would have liked this book more if Wallace had used the third-person omniscient POV. The author could have shown/told us plenty of things that way and, in fact, would have retained the ability to go from one character to another\u2014as long as she didn't head hop, i.e. switch right in the middle of a section, it could have been an effective technique.Now, about the actual story, which is decent but loses points for the WTFery that occurs throughout.Keira Maddock, the main character, is an outlaw. As a Freelancer, she does very-bad things to people, including killing and stealing from them, because that's how she survives. Cool, right? I like cheering for heroes and heroines who're trying to make things right\u2014even when that involves heavy-duty violence, which this book includes in generous doses.What Keira doesn't know at the beginning of this book is that the Resistance is a more-organized, larger group of people trying to accomplish certain things, like kicking ruling-class ass. At some point, she has to decide if she wans to join them or keep Freelancing on her own. Either way, she's going to keep doing violent, usually awesome things.Overall, that storyline's good. In fact, this could be great because the Resistance is growing and learning\u2014trying to educate and ignite as many people as possible so they'll overthrow their oppressors. If enough subjects in Tkaron catch on, their world will change for the better. Oh. Yeah. The region's named \"Tkaron\" even though the overwhelming majority of this ebook is written in current, American English. The hell? Tkaron? Another region's named Mediterra or something\u2014very similar to \"Mediterranean,\" which makes perfect sense\u2014but the area Keira and her sibs call home gets a difficult-to-pronounce name right out of a sci-fi novel that takes place on a spaceship.Some of the characters' actions make no sense whatsoever:-One character, after a lifetime of poverty, is told at the last-possible minute to act like she belongs in the wealthy class. Somehow, she pulls off this charade without flaws\u2014even when she's confronted by authority figures. Bull. Crap. She's in an entirely new environment, was just told how to act, and manages to perfectly execute this plan? Sure. Considering that, up until that point, she was a physically beaten, emotionally abused, blue-collar worker with no apparent qualms about being treated like crap, I'm not buying it.-Some side stories and events don't add much, if anything, to the ebook. These elements pad the word count and, well, that's about it. Going into details would involve spoilers, which I'm trying to avoid.-A significant revelation that doesn't happen until the eighty-something percent mark (but steers the rest of the book) comes as an unpleasant surprise to everyone, character and reader alike. I'm stuck in first person, so I know precisely what the characters know about this, which is nothing. Before that comes up, though, I'm already bored and am just finishing the ebook so I don't have another \"DNF\" title for my readers, who just got one last time. Then there's the dialogue, which is so unnatural it belongs in a B movie: \u201cYes, for the past 11 years. I was 16 when we moved to Tkaron. It was during my turbulent adolescence, and I was more than a little upset about leaving all of my friends. But, when your father gets a better paying job in a big city with more opportunities\u2026 Well, I didn't have much of a choice. It ended up being a wise move.\u201d Wallace, S. L. (2011-08-18 02:00:00-05:00). Price of a Bounty (Reliance on Citizens Makes Us Great!) (Kindle Locations 223-225). Kindle Edition. Yes, \"turbulent adolescence,\" indeed.Worse, Wallace has a nearly insatiable need to write less-than-believable dialogue and then, because she's writing in first-person POV, tell us what the character's thinking: I softened my tone, \u201cYour answer. Please, tell me what the money is for.\u201d My eyes pleaded with him to tell me. Something inside me whispered that the answer was important.  He looked at me steadily for a moment, calculating, and then shared just a little. \u201cAll right, that money was meant to help people, the sick, the needy, those the Elite step upon or push out of the way. People like your father, I suspect.\u201d  I felt a catch in my throat. Could he possibly understand? Why did he refer to the Elite as if he wasn't one of them? Isn't Richard the type of person who steps on people to get ahead? Aren't they all? Wallace, S. L. (2011-08-18 02:00:00-05:00). Price of a Bounty (Reliance on Citizens Makes Us Great!) (Kindle Locations 546-555). Kindle Edition. Most of the book uses weak, loose writing along those lines. In my experience (I'm a freelance writer, by the way), writers can't often edit our work to professional standards. We need other peoples' eyes, perspectives, and knowledge to make our work truly great, which is why publishing houses still spend so much money on full teams of editors. Price Of A Bounty could use that kind of editing; the story's interesting, and I like Keira enough to stick with her to the end of Book One to see what happens, but the execution is lacking enough to be frustrating."}, {"userName": "J.R.

She is the first we are introduced to but soon we are introduced to other characters.In fact the first few chapters cover over the same points from several perspectives and, whereas I personally don't like to go back over things, I can see why; so that we could better get to grips with these new characters.This book is very character driven, all the people in it come across as very real, extremely compelling and carry the story very well (from other works I've read of Wallace's she always manages to create very real characters)However I would love to explore this land more as I haven't formed a very strong picture of the surroundings; other than the rich are rich and have gardens and posh cutlery and the poor are poor.I will be reading the next one as I can't wait to see where this story goes and to find out what it was that sparked the war that sent everything spiralling into chaos.All in all a very readable and intriguing read with a twist that I just did not see coming.

(There were not any realms with earth names, I think.) The rich and powerful elite run everything, and control information in the poor realm of Tkaron.  But there is a Resistance that is working to overthrow the system. The story focuses on three siblings, Kiera, Scott, and April, who take on different roles in this society. Kiera is a Freelancer, doing anything for money to survive. Scott is a soldier who is, supposedly, working for the government. And April is a civilian trying to survive as a poor worker for a rich family. They all get caught up in the Resistance and have to make some hard choices, and suffer the consequences. Will they beat the system, or will it beat them? The Good: It had a few surprises. The subject matter was interesting and futuristic. As a sci-fi fan, this is the type of subject that I like. It was a combination of futurism and realistic action thriller. The main POV character, Kiera, is well-formed and believable. It had truthful, gritty violence in some parts, without gore. The last 10-15% of the book was the most interesting, with some surprises and twists. The OK: It is a good book, with the world and some of the characters well developed. The book has a changing POV in each chapter. Each of the four main characters describes events in 1st person POV. Sometimes I had to pause to remember who was thinking and saying \"I\" at a few chapters.Recommended for fans of sci-fi, and dystopian worlds, and action/adventure."}, {"userName": "Ria Lize", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2055542-ria-lize", "userReview": "I loved this book. And this was free. Is this still free? You might want to grab it, because I would've paid for it.This book has shifting POVs, but i was not distracted at all. In fact, I rather liked it, and I thought I wouldn't.Some parts were a little disturbing and if you've read it, you'll probably know what I mean, with April and Keira with that Cole guy.*shudder*I liked that this was different, it was a nice change from all the romantic suspense I've been reading lately. Speaking of romance, I loved that although this was not plainly a romance book, romance was still a pretty huge part of it, and I loved every freaking bit of it.Heroine was very independent and kick-ass, in her own way. Even when she has killed people in her line of work, she is still vulnerable and you can't help but like her.Guy. <3 I love him.Scott, felt sorry for him towards the end.April.. she could totally have her own story. Wonder if she'll have a love interest. She deserves one.I like the whole discrete operation thing. It's just plain fun to read about them able to do stuff without the baddies knowing about it. Ending was satisfying, although I really felt for April and wish it didn't end that way. She shouldn't have to go through all that. :'(Overall this was awesome. It was fast-paced and each chapter was very short and I found myself thinking \"just one more chapter\", until I've read several.

Teenagers will appreciate the spirit of protagonist Keira and the other narrators, Guy, Scott, and April, as they struggle against the malevolent plans of members of the rich Elite. Price of a Bounty builds slowly, getting to know the characters through a shifting first-person narration that is heavy on dialogue. Who can be trusted? Everyone has multiple names and identities, and friendship, loyalty, and love are all hard to establish in a world of betrayal and suspicion. In time, however, this sorts itself out, and really intense action starts. The novel has a series of dramatic surprises at the end -- I had no idea what was coming at any point in the final third of the book.The feel is somewhere between Orwell and present-day America. The powerful and influential Elite oppress everyone else with their selfish desire and ability seemingly to kill at will -- but there are still an active yet untrustworthy government and even a semi-independent media, making this a story about deadly maneuvers in the shadows and behind the scenes. In a particularly fine sequence of painful contrasts, two characters go on a romantic retreat, while another is subject to brutal mistreatment.

There was quite a bit of action as you would expect from a tale like this; but unfortunately, that alone, was not enough to keep the story afloat. Although the idea for this story grabbed me in the beginning, I felt there was quite a bit lacking in the actual story told. This could have been an amazing book, but instead it was just good. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it was an entertaining book; it just really disappoints me when an author doesn\u2019t reach their full potential in a story. I do have to mention one annoying aspect of the writing. The author uses first person, but changes POV with each chapter. I didn\u2019t mind the changing of POVs, but what I didn\u2019t like was the author repeating the same scenes with the same dialogue over again.

In a world where the Elite rule and the rest suffer without electricity or basics, each try to make a difference, while fighting their own demons and battles. Secrets are revealed and bonds formed.

I really love distopian stories and thoroughly enjoyed `Price of a Bounty'. Set in a realm that has gone to ruin after the preceding war, this is a fast paced story about the stranglehold one group of people, in this case the Gov, or government, run exclusively by the very wealthy, have over the general population; denying them even basic necessities and information about the outside world in order to hang on to their own power.Keira, Scott and April; siblings who's parents died in fishy circumstances are left struggling to survive. Scott, the eldest, joins the military, Keira, the heroine of the story becomes an assassin and April, the youngest works as a servant for one of the Elite. When one of Keira's marks turns out to be a leader of the secret resistance, she becomes involved in the struggle.

Keira is a Freelancer, Richard is a Guide and Scott is an undercover Shepherd. And there's April, Scott and Keira's sister.  This story is set in the future although I'm not too sure how far ahead. It's like a futuristic Robin Hood with a twist. I really liked how SL didn't just make it about stealing from the rich to give to the poor.

In fact, she often acts in ways that would be considered downright un-ladylike. A hired killer and thief whose only goal is to provide the necessities of life for herself and her sister, she has learned to be brutally effective in her trade, with skills as sharp as the weapons she prefers. And when the head of a huge, shadowy corporation hires her to remove a powerful and wealthy opponent, Keira is happy to oblige. Until she meets him... Scott Maddock is a hardened Terenian soldier-for-life. His job, to uphold the motto of the realm: \"Reliance on Citizens Makes Us Great!\" Soldiers work for the Gov, and the Gov is run by heads of corporations. But where do Scott's loyalties really lie? Only he and his best friend know for sure. April Maddock is trying to make it on her own and has taken a job with a wealthy family. She has chosen not to fight the system like Keira, nor to fight for the Gov like Scott. Unlike her siblings, she recognizes the good in everyone. Even so, outside appearances can be deceiving. April knows that better than most. Infested with greed and divided by power, the realm of Terene bears remarkable resemblance to our own society. But opposite despair, there is always hope. Whereas Keira Maddock brings destruction, Guy Bensen brings promise. Wealthy and powerful, yet thoughtful and caring, he is an anomaly who throws her completely off guard. When she learns of his connections to Scott and April, Keira knows she has made the right decision in not only sparing his life but in joining his cause. In book one of the Reliance on Citizens trilogy, S. L. Wallace introduces a world divided in which not everyone is who he seems to be. In a seamless blend of action, sci-fi, romance and political suspense, we are encouraged to consider the bonds that makes us human.", "title": "Price of a Bounty\n      \n          (Reliance on Citizens Makes us Great! #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12774270-price-of-a-bounty", "average": 3.56, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1319935260l/12774270.jpg", "reviews": 30, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5247133.S_L_Wallace", "name": "S.L.
