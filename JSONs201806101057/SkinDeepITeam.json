MWAH, MWAH, MWAH! Uh-oh, are we a bit jealous, Megan? I'm sorry, but I had to do that. Okey dokey, let me get down to business. YOWZA! Pamela did it again--she delivers in spades! Did I love it? Hell yes, I did! Two scarred and vulnerable people find love. It's moving. It's intimate. It's hot. Well, I have my little fantasy, too. I want to get stuck in the snow--just once in a lifetime. And then I end up on a marvelous ranch in Colorado. My oh my, think of all the possibilities...I loved Nate and Megan's experiment. So cute. Quick kisses. Covert kisses. Slow, deep kisses. Tongue. No tongue. Nate never made her feel queasy or repulsed. He made her feel secure and she trusted him. Nate is very fierce and a tough guy when he had to protect Megan. Then again, he is such a gentle, considerate, caring and tender man when he interacted with Megan. Having said this, Nate had to deal with some problems of his own. He is emotionally sensitive due to his disfigurement. Nate always hoped that a woman might one day see beyond his scars to the man he was inside. But Megan was doing way more than that. She was accepting him--the man. She is gentle and kind and she made him forget his \"ugliness\". Megan needed a man she could trust--the right man. Nate was the right man. Even though Megan made mistakes in her past, Nate accepted her unconditionally. I loved to see how she \"learned\" to trust him. Moreover, Megan wanted him. Do you want me to talk about the love scene? Naturally it was steamy, passionate, hot and yet at the same time very lovely and tender. Nate is an absolutely considerate lover. On the other hand, Megan was insightful as well. A badly scarred man doesn't like to show his body. She found the right words, after all.\"If you think your scars bother me, you're wrong. In my eyes, you're a hero. Your scars are just proof of that.\"These two wonderful people truly deserved their HEA. Moments of bliss. *thud, thud, thud* That's my heart, ladies.The beer run was absolutely fan-freaking-tastic! Despite its seriousness it was incredibly hilarious! A bunch of HOTNESS reunited. You guys are just A.W.E.S.O.M.E.! *swoon*God, yes, I'm on my knees, Marc. Thank you, thank you, thank you for saying that chicks don't like it when guys are walking around with sagging pants! Amen.\"I've always wanted to ask this question. Why do you walk around with sagging pants? Do you think it's sexy? Does it make you look tough? 'Look how bad I am. I don't even pull up my pants.' You look stupid, man. Chicks don't like it. I bet you never get laid or even--\"What the heck should I tell you? Just two words: READ IT!!! Sorry, four more words\u2026You won't regret it!\"That was beautiful.\" He kissed her cheek, the scotch and her scent warming his blood. \"Thanks.\" Oh, yeah. He was so getting laid tonight. Me too, Hunter. *wiggling eyebrows*"}, {"userName": "Jessica's Totally Over The Top Book Obsession", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28967089-jessica-s-totally-over-the-top-book-obsession", "userReview": "I loved this little novella!

Nate West, a local rancher, has just delivered several cases of beef to a community shelter and as he's leaving he spots Megan, that sweet, beautiful woman he's noticed volunteering at the shelter... and she's in trouble! Being the kind of man he is, Nate steps in to kick ass and it turns out to be one of the best decisions he's ever made.Wow, I really enjoyed this short story! Megan is all grown up, taking care of herself, moving on and not allowing herself to remain a victim. She has such strength, such compassion... I simply adore the woman she has become! And Nate. *sigh* Nate West, a new character to the series, is all kinds of wonderful. A strong, hard working, honorable man... Nate is everything I love in a hero. He brings with him some emotional and physical scars, and this makes him all the more appealing. Apart they are wonderful, but when Nate and Megan come together they are perfect! And seeing sweet, adorable little Emily, Megan's daughter, was such a treat! Skin Deep is a sweet, sexy story that gives our Megan the happily ever after she is so deserving of and adds another hot, alpha male to the cast of I-Team heroes!!Bonus story! And if that's not enough, the extra little story at the end, Marc & Julian Make a Beer Run, is laugh out loud funny and an awesome revisit with my favorite team of RS heroes!!!Great news!!

Now Megan\u2019s making eyes at Nate and Marc\u2019s not happy, because no one can take care of his sister as good as he can\u2026so he thinks! Let the pissin\u2019 contest begin!!!Pamela Clare does it again! I could not put it down, and stayed up until the wee hours of the morning to finish! Beautifully written story about 2 people who are trying to piece themselves back together, each having suffered from tragic events that now shape their lives. Megan is trying to build a life and home for herself and her daughter, Emily. She still deals with the shame of being a recovered drug addict, and letting her brother Marc take the fall when she killed one of the men who raped her in prison. Nate is healing from a horrific incident in Afghanistan, in which he was severely injured, burned and has left him permanently scarred. He also suffers from the mental anguish of losing his comrades and watching the other men that were injured deal with their own living hell. Then he meets Megan, albeit not under normal circumstances. They have chemistry and both are willing to explore the possibility of something more, they are perfect for each other, much to Marc\u2019s dismay. Oh that Marc\u2026or shall I call him a mother hen...his patience is about to be tested!Jack, Nate\u2019s father, and Emily form a loving relationship of their own and these two delightful characters added depth and emotion to this novella that reads like a full length novel.

On top of all this there is a short story, Marc and Julian Make a Beer Run, where the \"posse\" work their magic once again, as they come in guns a blazin\u2019 to save the day! This unlikely band of brothers had me laughing and smiling, I wanted to jump into the book and hug them all\u2026maybe even fondle them\u2026did I say that?! What a treat\u2026you are so good to us Pamela!! On a final note\u2026I LOVE YOU MARC HUNTER\u2026and if Sophie ever leaves you, I\u2019ll be right here waiting for you *smooches*. She won\u2019t, but one can dream *sigh*! **One more final note and a request**In this novella we read about a fictional character Nate who suffers from the affects of going to war, being a soldier and serving his country. Everyday around the world, the life of Nate and his comrades depicted in this novella, is \u201creal life\u201d for the men and women who serve in the military. They struggle to overcome unimaginable changes in their lives, physically and mentally, families are torn apart and all too often the financial impact is devastating. So maybe take a week, brown bag it to work, make your own coffee, have that Friday night dinner at home, or even do a re-read instead of buying a new book\u2026send that money you saved and support an organization that supports the military in your home country. Two that I support myself are, Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund http://semperfifund.org/ , my brother was a proud Marine, and theWounded Warrior Project http://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/ ,or take the time to thank someone whose served.

I don\u2019t have time to fully review this book to give it the justice it deserves. And there\u2019s no way I could possibly gush enough over how much I enjoyed the sweet, touching romance between a remarkable H/h, both of whom are battered souls deserving of gentleness, healing, and love. Pamela Clare never fails to amaze me with her emotional, powerful stories and she pens some of the absolute best heroes in romance.

SO GOOD!!! To be reviewed..........5 Stars! -  Also reviewed at:Lady Jayne's Reading Den  24 May 2012, AustraliaGovernor of Romancelandia Declares Pamela Clare Model \u201cPrisoner\u201d But Won\u2019t Release HerAuthor, Pamela Clare, made headlines when more readers became confirmed I-Team-oholics after reading Unlawful Contact, the third I-Team book, starring the dangerously gorgeous Marc Hunter and the sweet and strong Sophie Alton (now Hunter).It was books such as that one that resulted in Ms Clare being charged with the following: \u201cCharge 1: Causing addiction to a book series through grippingly suspenseful, sensual, emotional, engaging, and thought-provoking writing.Charge 2: Creating to-die-for heroes who steal hearts, and who induce immense longing for \u201cUnlawful Contact\u201d with said heroes.Charge 3: Risk to personal safety by writing scenes which induce heart palpitations, breathlessness, sudden swooning, hot flashes and the melting of panties.\u201d  To read the judgement of The People of Romancelandia v Pamela Clare [2010] SCRR 6996 (31 October 2010), click here: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...Justice Isabith McHardup of the Supreme Court of Romancelandia found Pamela Clare guilty of all charges and sentenced her to write amazing stories, with to-die-for heroes, for life. Ms Clare\u2019s recently released, and self-published, I-Team After Hours novella, Skin Deep, featuring Marc Hunter\u2019s baby sister, Megan Hunter, has been a roaring success amongst I-Team-oholics and is just another prime example of Ms Clare\u2019s addictive and satisfying writing.In a statement released by the Governor of Romancelandia, following the steady flow of raving 5-Star reviews upon the release of Skin Deep, the Governor stated: \u201cMs Clare has been a model \u201cprisoner\u201d by continuing to write wonderful stories, and thus, I\u2019m afraid I cannot release her from her sentence to do so, for life. Her I-Team-oholics need her stories. Bravo, Ms Clare, for keeping them out of mischief by keeping them happy! And for self-publishing!\u201dReaders will be delighted with the tightly-written novella which features a scarred heroine and hero \u2013 Megan, scarred by the traumas in her past from sexual abuse and addiction; and Nate, a former Marine in Afghanistan, turned Colorado rancher, physically and emotionally scarred from an explosion, while in the service of his country. When Megan\u2019s life is threatened outside the community kitchen she volunteers for, and to which Nate and his father donate ground Angus beef to, Nate comes to the rescue. Thus, begins, a beautiful story of the healing power of love. Pamela Clare has created yet another to-die-for hero in Nate West who is strong, courageous, protective, honourable, attentive, HOT, tender, patient, kind and understanding. Readers with a weakness for scarred heroes are sure to love him. Former Marine, Nate West, while on leave at Cimarron Ranch, before the explosion  The right side of Nate's face and body were severely burnt in Afghanistan Lady Jayne, the complainant in Ms Clare\u2019s trial in 2010, had this to say about Skin Deep: \u201cWhile the relationship developed quickly, I loved how Nate tenderly and sensually, with such understanding and great perceptiveness, awakened Megan\u2019s desires and helped her heal from the traumas of her past. From their sweet kisses, sizzling explorations, and the trust they had in baring their souls and bodies to each other, which was significant given both their scars\u2026 It was just beautiful! Even though time-wise it may have been fast, it didn\u2019t feel rushed to me, at all, but made complete sense. I loved how Megan saw beyond Nate\u2019s disfigurement, and saw the precious hero within. My chest tightened when she kissed his burn scars. I just loved honourable and brave Nate and it was so wonderful to see Megan get her happily-ever-after with a worthy hero, after all she'd been through! Nate was just wonderful with Megan's daughter, Emily, and so was his dad, Jack - Just Aww...\u201d  Sweet, willowy redhead, Megan Hunter, gets her HEA Megan\u2019s daughter, Emily, and Nate\u2019s father, Jack, are also heart-stealers, and the snow-covered Colorado ranch setting made the novella extra special, indeed.  The Wests' ranch, Cimarron Ranch, is a picturesque ranch mansion The Wests take pride and care in their horses and family ranch Four-year old Emily falls in love with the Wests' horsesFor a novella, which tend to leave Lady Jayne a bit unsatisfied, due to the short length, \u201cSkin Deep was engaging, hot, sweet, suspenseful, heart-warming and just satisfied on so many levels. It was just SO GOOD! There was nothing lacking in this novella!\u201dIn usual amazing Pamela Clare style, Skin Deep was not only entertaining, but brought to readers\u2019 minds important issues. In this novella, the great service and sacrifices that soldiers make for their country, the effects of Post-Traumatic Stress and deep pain for soldiers and victims of sexual assault, were highlighted deftly in the story. It is clear that Ms Clare took great pains to portray them with sensitive and thoughtful realism.While the novella can be read as a stand-alone, as Ms Clare does reveal what happened to Megan in it, it does contain some spoiler-ish content for Unlawful Contact. Lady Jayne said that she would encourage new readers to read the series in order, to truly appreciate the interactions between the characters and their stories. If you haven\u2019t read the series, START. READING. NOW! The novella is not all Ms Clare gifted her dedicated readers with. Included with it is a bonus short story titled \u201cMarc and Julian Make a Beer Run\u201d, which features all the past I-Team heroes and heroines, and while it dealt with a scary but all too real issue, was also humorous and an enjoyable read. \u201cI just love the bromance between Marc and Julian. Heck, I love the way all the guys relate to each other! And that many hotties packed into one great short story? YOWZA, SWOONS!\u201d squealed Lady Jayne. She admitted to being very happy to see Reece, from Extreme Exposure, the first book in the series, featured in this short story, as she said she hardly sees him and he has a special place in her heart. Though, Marc Hunter is the one who has truly stolen her heart away.It is no wonder that the Governor refuses to release Ms Clare. Though, considering that Ms Clare is able to serve out her sentence in the beautiful Colorado landscape, and gets to create more swoon-worthy heroes to warm her and her readers\u2019 days and nights, it\u2019s a sentence she could probably live with.Series Reading Order:     Image Credits:1.

No, let me rephrase that; I\u2019m in lust with his voice. In fact, it took me much longer than it should have to finish listening to this story because there were certain sentences, certain\u2026 uh\u2026 \u201cthings\u201d he said that had me scrolling (is that the right word for rewinding an audio book?) back to listen to them again and again. There were times I\u2019d adjust my ear-buds, nearly to the point of pain, just to make sure no one else could hear these \u201cthings,\u201d and when my husband said I was looking a bit flushed and asked if I was feeling okay, I replied with, \u201cJust a hot-flash, hon.\u201d Not exactly a lie, that, but never thought I\u2019d be so thankful to have the \u201cmenopausal\u201d excuse to fall back on!

And having read this e-book many times, I had formed pretty definitive personality attributes to all the characters, and Mr. Griffith nailed them, each and every one. I\u2019m looking forward to listening to more stories told through Kaleo Griffith\u2019s voice.And now I\u2019ll leave you with my original review of the ebook version:Megan Hunter, Marc Hunter's baby sister, has been working hard to put her life back together after the horrific ordeal she went through years ago, and just as things are falling into place, when things are finally looking up, she gets a very unwelcome, very dangerous visitor from her past.

Me ha encantado y rechiflado \u00e9ste libro-relato corto, que a\u00fan no s\u00e9 c\u00f3mo o d\u00f3nde encasillar. Es largo para ser un relato y corto para ser una novela, pero a pesar de las apenas 250 p\u00e1ginas que tiene lo he disfrutado de principio a fin.Lo primero de todo, antes de leerlo recomiendo haber le\u00eddo \"Esp\u00f3same\", el tercer libro de la serie, pues en \u00e9l conocemos a Megan, la hermana con montones de problemas de Marc Hunter, lo que le ocurri\u00f3, y todo por lo que tuvo que pasar. S\u00ed, Megan es la protagonista de \u00e9ste libro.Unos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de los hechos acaecidos en \"Esp\u00f3same\", Megan est\u00e1 empezando una nueva vida con su peque\u00f1a hija Emily, detr\u00e1s dej\u00f3 sus problemas y quiere empezar de nuevo, tiene un nuevo trabajo, una casa y el Estado le dio una indemnizaci\u00f3n debido a lo que padeci\u00f3. Pero una persona de su pasado volver\u00e1 para sobornarla y no la dejar\u00e1 en paz hasta que no consiga lo que quiera.Durante el encontronazo entre Megan y su problema, aparecer\u00e1 nuestro protagonista, Nathaniel West para frustrar los planes del otro. Nate West fue un marine del ej\u00e9rcito americano, pero una fuerte explosi\u00f3n en servicio le dej\u00f3 una horribles cicatrices f\u00edsicas, ahora repuesto s\u00f3lo quiere llevar una vida tranquila en el rancho que llevan \u00e9l y su padre. Aunque sus heridas se llevaron parte de su vida, es un personaje \u00edntegro que no ha ca\u00eddo en la autocompasi\u00f3n, vive el d\u00eda a d\u00eda, y un d\u00eda encuentra a una chica que le intriga y le gusta en un comedor de beneficencia. Est\u00e1 en el lugar adecuado en el momento adecuado, y cuando ve que alguien est\u00e1 amenazando a Megan en su coche, corre a salvarla. S\u00ed \u00bfHe dicho que Nate es todo un h\u00e9roe de Pamela Clare? Es todo eso y m\u00e1s.As\u00ed es como se conocen los protagonistas y como empezar\u00e1 su historia. Nate invita a Megan y a su hija a su rancho familiar para que la peque\u00f1a vea a los caballos. Megan acepta para poder escapar del control policial al que su hermano la ha sometido tras el ataque que sufri\u00f3, pero una intensa nevada har\u00e1 que Megan y Emily tengan que aislarse unos d\u00edas en el rancho West.Todo, absolutamente todo de \u00e9sta peque\u00f1a novela me ha encantado. La historia me enganch\u00f3 desde la primera p\u00e1gina, sus protagonistas me han parecido muy atractivos, hay mucha qu\u00edmica entre ellos, y aunque Megan, debido a su pasado no se cree merecedora del aprecio que Nate le demuestra, \u00e9ste tendr\u00e1 la suficiente confianza como para luchar por ellos.

Her characters have to be real because she makes them come alive in the span of a few pages. Amazing.For all us I-Team addicts.....this is the fix we've been waiting for! Skin Deep finally tells the story of what happens to Marc Hunter's sister from the book Unlawful Contact. Megan Hunter lived through hell on earth and has been slowly started to piece back together the parts of her broken life. Her 4 year old daughter is the light of her life, and I felt this little girl added so much to this story.Nate West is a former special ops marine who unfortunately was badly disfigured after an IED exploded. Many of his close friends were killed or permanently handicapped. Nate escaped with his life, but sustained horrific burns that encompass half his body.As a woman with a history filled with sexual assault and abuse, Megan's attraction to Nate terrifies her! Surprisingly, Megan feels comfortable with Nate from the beginning and is drawn to him like no other man that she has ever met.Nate and Megan are truly kindred spirits. They both are deeply scarred and are in bondage to those scars. Magically, the relationship that develops between the two of them ultimately gives them both freedom. It was absolutely beautiful to watch.As a side gift..the rest of the I-TEAM gang shows up and we are treated to a beautiful epilogue, a wedding that will make tears run down your face, and a guy reunion that was filled with so much testosterone that I wondered how they could all fit on one page!This book was pure joy, pure satisfaction, and pure entertainment.

This one definitely surpassed whatever I could have delivered. Nate West was the ideal partner for Megan given his history. His physical injuries may have hindered his prospects for deeper relationships, but they were only \"skin deep\" because his spirit was remarkable. On the surface, Megan looks as if she's got the world mastered but that's just a fa\u00e7ade to mask the pain beneath regarding her past and guilt for what she allowed to happen to her brother, Marc. Their relationship developed nicely and the outcome, despite some really tense moments in between, was truly heartwarming. Loved this story and Megan's triumph. The bonus short story accompanying this one, Marc and Julian's Beer Run, was just that...a really nice bonus. And, Kaleo Griffith's narration is just perfect.

Megan and Nate were two people scarred by their pasts, both emotionally and physically, and the tenderness they found with each other was really sweet.

She more than deserves it after her past that was filled with torture, pain and hopelessness (Unlawful Contact). She's trying to keep her life steady and stable for not only her own benefit but most importantly for her 4 year old daughter, Emily. But a man from Megan's past, Donny who's also Emily's father, knows she recently came into money from a settlement and starts threatening her for money. Megan turns first to her brother, Marc, for help and eventually finds herself at Nate West's ranch. Nate West, a former Marine who was horribly scarred on one side of his body during an explosion, was in the right place at the right time when he first met and helped Megan during a run in with Donny. He gives her an open invitation to bring Emily to his ranch to see his horses any time she wants. Megan takes him up on his offer and heads to the ranch, only to be caught there for a few days during a snow storm. Nate, Megan, Emily and Nate's dad Jack all spend a few days getting to know each other, and relationships are formed start to heal Megan and Nate.\"When a man touches me, I feel...revulsion. I instantly feel sick to my stomach...What those men did to me - it's a part of me. I can't shake it.\"  (...)  \"I'm sorry. If I'd known...\" Nate's frown deepened. \"Did I make you feel that way just now when I held you?\"  \"N-no.\" Warmth rushed to Megan's cheeks.  (...)  His gaze locked with hers. \"And last night - when I kissed you?\"  \"No.\" She rushed to explain. \"But we were interrupted, and I... I think maybe there just wasn't time for me to react.\"  Nate set his drink down on the coffee table. \"Do you want to test that theory?\"  Megan's heart took off at a sprint. \"Wh-what do you mean?\"  \"I could kiss you again just like I did last night-soft and easy-and since we're not going to be interrupted this time, you'll be able to see whether that sense of revulsion kicks in. If it does, we stop.\"  \"And if it doesn't?\"  He gave her a lopsided grin. \"We'll know you just needed to kiss the right man.\"Nate and Megan are both dealing with issues that are keeping them from moving forward and living life. Nate has a hard time letting people get close, especially women. He doesn't come across a lot of people who are able to look past his skin and really see him. Megan does that from the start - she truly sees Nate for the man that he is and looks at his scars as signs of his courage, nothing more or less. It felt incredibly emotional to read from Nate's POV because he was finally able to just be himself and feel accepted. For Megan, she has a hard time touching men, which is understandable due to a past that was filled with abuse and having people she thought she could trust turn their backs on her. She's only ever had Marc and now she's trying to be a good mom to Emily, but she can't imagine ever feeling comfortable enough around a man to be with him, kiss him, have sex, get married. These are all things that she never dreamed of. Nate knows her entire past and like he tells Megan, \"...Who you were then is not who you are now, and I'm interested in the woman you are today.\" Even though their story takes place over the course of a little more than a week, their romance and the progression of it worked. They went from simple kisses that rocked Megan completely, to a sweet sex scene that allowed them both to let go of the past and think about what a future together could be like. Little Emily and Jack were so sweet! Emily is so adorable and her random comments and actions had me smiling every time she came on page. Nate's dad Jack was also a great character to get to know. He balanced out the family and I enjoyed his talks with Nate. The I-Team men show up briefly and it doesn't take much from them to have me laughing out loud. Just the thought of a criminal trying to kick Julian, or Marc being the protective older brother, it's the little moments with these men that pack a big punch. This short story reads well as a stand-alone, but if you're not familiar with the I-Team series, all the books are definitely worth a read. I enjoyed seeing Megan get her happy ending and I fell in love with another hero that Pamela Clare brought us. Nate is a strong man who comes alive when he finds a woman that loves him, scars and all. I loved getting to know this couple and seeing them get their happy ending."}, {"userName": "Michelle [Helen Geek]", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5557851-michelle-helen-geek", "userReview": "4 Solid StarsSo many have done so much in their reviews on this one, I don't have much to add.

She has trouble seeing his when hers are deeper, more ugly and lastingSecond chances. Seems like an easy concept, but really not. Much harder starting over.

It's what hurt the I-Team books I read, especially book 3 (Marc and Sophie's story). Don't hate me GR friends, but Marc Hunter's story was my least favorite. It caused me to put the series on hold. (The remaining books are gathering dust on my TBR pile.)*ducks*- I loved when Nate's father, Jack, warned him that Megan came with a lot of baggage. Realistic.- Megan and Nate neck. They spent days at first base. Yes! - Megan's first time with Nate was written perfectly. (I worried that the sex would feel rushed or be very cheesy. It wasn't!)- Megan had received counseling. Falling in love wasn't the heal all. It was the last step she needed to take to move on with her life. - Nate was the perfect hero. His burn scars were his vulnerabilty. The author wrote a scene where he makes himself vulnerable while empowering Megan at the same time. Awesome! - The author built in time for events to occur. Megan and Nate didn't have sex, fall in love, move in together, and marry in one week. Woo hoo! Time passed without any boring fluff. - The epilogue was touching and funny. - The Beer Run short story was an added treat!What Didn't Work For Me- The previous heroes/heroines from the I-Team series were confusing. I've only read the first three books in the I-team series.- Me. I kept distracting myself waiting for the author to write a TSTL moment or push the characters to the perfect smexy moment and HEA.
