Let's call her Stupidhead because I couldn't care enough to remember her name. She finds out on her 21st birthday party that her loving, adoring family is not her biological family. They found her as a very small child and cared enough to take her in and give her a wonderful home full of people who loved and adored her.So she breaks up with her perfect fiancee, marries an asshole, has a child, is a terrible mother, distances herself from everyone who ever loved her, screws up her child's life so that her child screws up HER daughters life...Then I didn't read on. I didn't read on because this book is based on an idiot, and I have a short fuse when it comes to idiots. Let's just say that I don't suffer them lightly.I'm sure that this book, if I read further, might turn out to be a fantastic and beautifully touching story with a great mystery that it's currently hinting at like a half-dressed male stripper with sad eyes and a g-string whose elastic is so flexible it no longer snaps. However, right now it's just a jumpy, painfully boring mess. I know it's probably realistic, after all there's plenty of idiots in the world. However, since I have so many life sized idiots on-call whenever I need them, I don't feel I have to read a book about them.Life is too short."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james", "userReview": "5 stars to Kate Morton's The Forgotten Garden. The plot is mesmerizing and the story-telling of the grandmother and the granddaughter is unparalleled. Morton jumps from time period to time period, country to country, character to character in a flawless manner. The imagery is astounding. The relationships are well planned. Morton keeps you guessing as to how it's all connected with the garden up front and center the whole way through the ride. Thoroughly enjoyed the journey this book takes you on.

Said old, mysterious house is actually a cottage on the wild Cornish coast, complete with a hidden garden, a handsome neighbor, and the faintest suggestion of the supernatural - check4.

We get to know Eliza, Nell and Cassandra intimately, and through them other characters who play a large part in the unfolding story: Rose, Nathaniel, Adeline, and Linus. Not a book to put down for a few days and pick back up later, The Forgotten Garden needs to be savored in long stretches so that the reader can fully connect to each character and their backstory. The continually jumping characters and time periods can get confusing and distracting at times , which prevents me from rating this story with a solid 5 stars. Otherwise, this tale is tailor made for my reading tastes, with sentences, like the following, that speak to me:\"She unlocked the front door and went inside. The house seemed to be listening, waiting to see what she would do. She ran her hand lightly along the inside wall. \"My house,\" she said softly, \"This is my house.\" The words pressed dully into the walls. How strange it was, how unexpected. She wandered through the kitchen, past the spinning wheel and into the little sitting room at the very front. The house felt different now that she was alone. Familiar somehow, like a place she'd visited long ago.\"Simple and comforting.

I'm going to quit picking books my friends love to death!  I have had this book for a year or more. I got it from the used bookstore for $1.00. I love the cover, I loved the summary and I thought I would love the book. Now, don't get me wrong. I liked the book, it just didn't take me there, wherever it took everyone else. Actually, there are 2 or 3 friends that almost everything they love, I will only like or not like at all so I should have known. This is a big ole book to get through. I was so intrigued in the beginning to find out what really happened to Nell. Why was she on that boat all by herself and not being able to remember everything. This book is wrapped in mysteries that includes many people and spans many years. Cassandra is in the current time and she has lived with her grandmother, Nell since she was little. Cassandra's mom wasn't a good woman. Nell, had a wonderful life until her father tells her a secret when she turned 21 (I think it was 21) and she got all mad and left everyone and dropped everything. Sigh. She got with some idiot and did a few idiot things and had an idiot daughter. BUT. If she hadn't done these things she would never have had Cassandra as a granddaughter and Cassandra was a good person. Nell and Cassandra run an antique shop together. After Nell's passing, Cassandra's finds all kinds of secrets and is determined to get to the bottom of things. This brings Cassandra to England and a house that Nell had bought. Cassandra learns so many things about Nell's past. It's not a simple one to find out but it's a pretty sad story none-the-less. There are a few different characters in the story, two prominent ones being Eliza and Rose. Like I said, it's a sad story. I do like something Cassandra found while she was getting the home fixed up in England. You just never know. . . .

I kept waiting for the blow to fall \u2014 murder? incest? buried treasure?? Alas, no. The narration shifts among different-but-related storylines, all of which, to be fair, I found intriguing: in 1913 a child who can\u2019t remember her name turns up on an Australian dock carrying a book of fairy tales; in 2005 her granddaughter tries to uncover the mysteries of a hidden garden in Cornwall; in Victorian England a wealthy young woman flees her family . . . only to have her orphaned daughter found and taken back to them. In each case I wanted to find out the whole story, but I figured they\u2019d tie together with more punch. Where were the dark secrets-within-a-secret? Where were the gasp-aloud revelations? I know we\u2019re not always going to get Darth Vader breathing, \u201cI am your father!\u201d but a few big shockers would have been nice. Maybe if the novel were presented a bit differently \u2014 as a family saga, not some mysterious tale \u2014 then I wouldn\u2019t have been disappointed. It\u2019s really a story of several women and the far-reaching effects their decisions have on their own and each other\u2019s lives. Woven throughout are fairy tales by the mysterious Authoress; it's hard to miss their thematic, at times allegorical, significance. They connect the generations through themes of foundlings, sacrifice, and the dangers of wanting what you can\u2019t have. If you like fairy tales, this would be a plus, but I could have done without them.Kate Morton is a bit heavy-handed in her characterizations, and, as with The House at Riverton, there\u2019s a bizarrely devoted sister-like relationship that involves extreme self-sacrifice in one of the parties and oblivious selfishness in the other. While many relationships are like this (for instance, I am self-sacrificing and my siblings are oblivious), they're not fun to read about. And with only one exception, the really nefarious characters \u2014 they\u2019re like villains out of a Dickens novel but without the flair \u2014 sort of fade away. I wanted the satisfaction of seeing them fall off a cliff and get eaten by sharks, or be impaled on pointy fence railings, not just die lonely or disappear from the story.

The Forgotten Garden is such a book. You finally read it and end up wondering why in the world you waited so long.

Nell, as the lost child, is the pivotal character around which all mysteries and actions revolve.

I didn't think a story about a family mystery could be so entertaining throughout, while still staying realistic and not going too over the top.Kate Morton just has the absolute best writing style for stories of this kind. She has a way of completely trapping you in the story she's telling, so that you lose yourself in it and just can't find a way out. And that's something highly positive! This is only the second book of hers I've read, but I'm already certain I'd have a wonderful time just reading her grocery list.This novel consists of over 50 chapters, each one of them told from a different point of view and taking place in a different time period. Sound like it's going to be confusing, right? Well, Mrs. Morton did her magic once again, and managed to not be confusing at all. I have no idea how she did it, but I was always able to picture everything that happened perfectly and each character had a distinctive voice, which made it easy to tell them apart.If I had to describe the plot in one word, I'd use \"magical\". It had so many layers, all very well thought out and interesting. There are many little details that get mentioned throughout. Some might call those details unnecessary, redundant or too elaborate, but as someone who loves long books with attention to minor things, it was an absolute joy to read such a fine work.I have to say, I was quite surprised at some of the dark themes that played a part. This especially concerns the ending, I really didn't expect this revelation. It was (surprisingly) fitting though, and I'm glad the author didn't shy away from going down this route.Lastly, I also feel the need to express my appreciation of the included fairy tales by Eliza Makepeace. I'd love to read more of them; they gave me a really comfy, warm and fuzzy feeling and reminded me of my childhood.

Eliza's mother was a young woman who had run away from her upper crust home, for reasons that become clear later in the story, but she is found and pulled back into her wealthy family's embrace (or maybe it's their tentacles).- Nell, born in 1909, who is found sitting on her suitcase on an Australian ship dock in 1913, adamantly refusing to say where she came from or even what her name is. Eventually she begins searching for her roots in England.- Cassandra, Nell's Australian granddaughter, who takes up the search in England after Nell dies.The storyline skips back and forth in time and from person to person (and also tosses in a few other characters' POVs here and there for good measure, which might irk you if you prefer a more linear plotline with a single POV). But the concerns of these characters and the themes of this book - like identity, finding oneself, family connections, desires - are so closely tied together that I didn't feel confused once I got to know the characters.Eliza is an author of mystical and sometimes dark fairy tales, with lovely sketched illustrations by another character. I really wanted to see these illustrations; I imagine them as something like an Arthur Rackham illustration: Some of Eliza's stories find their way into the text of this book, and their symbolism and autobiographical qualities help to unravel the mystery of Eliza's life and how it connects to Nell's and Cassandra's. Toward the end I was able to guess the main mysteries of the book, but at least they didn't come out of left field.There are some nasty and disturbed characters in this book and a few really ill-advised decisions made by characters who are otherwise likeable, so it's not all rainbows and unicorns here.

It was a mystery that had me second guessing myself several times. Every time I had it all figured out a new chink was added to the chain of clues. I think the style of writing was superbly done, not often can I say that. I loved the way each chapter transported me to another time and a different POV spanning the generation of women in the family. I did find new evil villains I wanted to see crushed and burned. Such evil greedy self righteous ploys they created for each had their own agendas and were so stone cold hearted. I honestly would have liked to have read more about Cassandra's new beginnings and how her life changed after revealing so many lost secrets \"just a touch more closer\". That is why I would hesitate on giving it 5 stars. I was a little put out that I didn't get more of her story. I do think the ending encounter was endearing and made me feel that peace was restored for Nell and lovely Eliza, the most unselfish characters I have ever read about. Made me really wish to have or create an unspoiled secret garden with roots to my own past. Wouldn't we all want a place of solitude to get away from it all and sit with a book while ancestral phantoms sprinkle their fairy dust-like magic into our lives to ease the daily stresses and reassure us we are loved?

She seemed a sane and strong character up until then.-The romance tacked on for current-day character (such an uninteresting character that I can't recall her name) at end felt rather de riguer. Don't believe that, either.-Only one woman in the bunch could feel life solid and worthwhile without a man or child or both, but no one was happy even if got what they wanted or thought they wanted.Why do so many stories about women have all this jealousy and the world view that there is one pie and if one woman gets a piece (happy life) some other woman will therefore lose out?

Her fiction is carefully researched and crafted, and the writing itself is luminous. The Forgotten Garden unwinds like a fairy tale, slowly curling off the spool where ambiguously benefic crones have wound it. We jump back and forth between present-day Australia where a young woman mourns the mysterious grandmother who inspired her as a child, to England at the turn of the last century where an affluent family in a small coastal town conspires to conceive, and then bury, a tremendous secret, one whose shock waves will reach forward across generations and oceans. At the heart of the England plot we find a friendship between two apparent opposites - one, the sheltered, sickly daughter of the rich family; one, the free-spirited adventurous tomboy - and a secret that rends them apart even as it knits them together. And at the heart of that, we find one of Morton's real strengths : her ability to capture the often bitter logic of human behavior, the ways in which trust and resentment weave together to form a hobbling grown-up-ed-ness rich with the sting of childhood betrayals.Another of Morton's gifts is especially prevalent in this novel : her intense focus on writers and the imaginary worlds they sculpt from words, especially writers of children's stories. Children's stories, this novel knows, hold their own ancient wisdoms about responsibility, trust and betrayal, and their truths - while far from palatable - are far preferable to the gossamer fables adults tell each other and themselves to make life liveable. Morton alternates between narrative chapters about present-day Australia and early-twentieth-century England, punctuated with insertions of fairy tales from a magical book within the book. As the story unravels, the reader begins to see traces of the real-life narrative in the images and metaphors of the fairy stories. And, at the end of the novel, it is up to the reader to determine whether the reverse is not true, as well - the eruption of fairy-tale logic within the stolid cadre of real life.I can't say much more about the plot without giving it away. It is a brilliantly structured and performed novel, one I could not put down (to clarify : I began the novel at the airport in Louisiana on my way to France. I finished it as the plane touched down in Paris. A perfect fit for the \"life is too short, you can sleep when you're dead\" school of thought)."}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122606-chelsea", "userReview": "I read 549 pages and that was the reveal?

Just not anything particularly interesting or worth waiting for. I get it, everyone in the book has mother/child abandonment issues.I think this book really wanted to be The Thirteenth Tale, but didn't have the balls (if you pardon the inaccurate expression, what with how female-centric both titles are). Now that book had a deeply buried family secret worth reading about.The writing wasn't terrible, and since I was able to sit through all 549 (FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE) pages, this one gets a whole extra star. It wasn't bad, it was just blah.(That said, I'm pretty sure I would read a book about Georgiana, the original lost mother, but of course that was the story that wasn't really told in long, boring, drawn-out detail.

I only recently discovered this author, having read her latest release, \u201cThe Lake House,\u201d and loved it. Naturally, I wanted more! The Forgotten Garden is just the type of novel I can lose myself in. I love family secrets within a historical setting that spans generations. The story begins with a little girl found all alone in 1913, taken in by a couple desperate for children, raising her as their own, naming her \u201cNell\u201d. Once Nell learns the truth, she is shattered by the revelations, and sabotages all the plans she has for the future. Years later, she is given a chance to learn more about her true heritage, but it wasn\u2019t until her granddaughter inherits Nell\u2019s estate, that the truth is slowly unearthed. Kate Morton\u2019s prose is mesmerizing, hypnotizing, and riveting. I enjoyed seeing the mystery unfold due to Cassandra\u2019s persistence, and with the help of those just as eager to help her obtain answers her grandmother never had the chance to. In some ways the tale is a sordid one, controversial even, with people making choices that affect generations of people. Some were selfish, some were selfless, and the results were often mixed. There are actually three stories here, woven together, carefully constructed to keep the reader in almost unbearable suspense, until all the shocking secrets of the forgotten garden are at last revealed, finally releasing the pain and heartbreak visited on so many, and opening up a new portal for peace and understanding. While many areas of this story are depressing, and it could be argued that it\u2019s a tragedy, it is also a kind a love story, and ends on such an uplifting note, I felt a huge sense of peace. I loved Eliza\u2019s fairy tales and the way they paralleled real events, in the story. I could help but feel for Eliza, but admired her, too, however, I was often perplexed by Nell\u2019s choices, but Cassandra is a gem and I think she will make sure the legacy of her true heritage is given the honor and respect it deserves. 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "I loved every page of this book, including the hokey stuff.This is definitely comfort reading, but it's not chick lit and it's not oversimplified.

This is a long and lovely story about a woman who made the wrong decision for the right reason, with consequences that echo down through the generations.

On the one hand, I loved and devoured the last three hundred pages of this book. I found Cassandra, Nell, and Eliza to all be compelling characters and I grew attached to each of them individually. The writing is really beautiful, even poetic in parts, and I loved the weaving of Eliza's fairy tales throughout. I also really enjoyed the setup of the book, with the three women narrating and the way Morton wove everything together so nicely, even repeating sections of narration at the end to show continuity. On the other hand, it took me 200+ pages to really grab onto it, which, in my opinion, is a bit too much. In fact, I was about to abandon the book around page 200, when there was a sudden twist. In addition, parts of the back story, particularly Eliza's, while necessary, should have been reduced. Also, the final twist of the story was likely not a twist for many readers - if you have been paying attention, it's fairly obvious. Finally, I felt that some of this was too reminiscent of The Secret Garden. Morton knowingly pays homage to Hodgeson Burnett, and even includes it in the story, but still, I felt it was a bit overdone. All in all, if you want to choose a family epic about discovering one's history, this is a great choice, though there are some flaws.

It is told as three stories covering three generations combining to give us clues along the way.Maybe the ending was a little predictable but I certainly did not guess all the answers to the mysteries along the way.The protagonist is Nell around who the whole mystery centres. The story starts in London when Nell as a little girl finds herself unexpectedly travelling by ship to Australia alone.

We get to know Eliza, Nell and Cassandra intimately, they are main narrators, but we can also see inside the heads of Rose, Nathaniel, Adeline, and Linus. I adore how twisted Montrachet family is. \"And he loves me, Mamma, he told me so.\" Adeline's heart tightened with fear. Darling girl, blinded by foolish thoughts of love. How to tell her that the hearts of men were not so easily won. If won, rarely kept. \"You'll see,\" Rose said. \"I shall live happily ever after.\u201d  Foreshadowing is a really cruel move. This story is full of mystery and allure. There is suspense from the start with secrets within secrets and new riddles piling up over and over again. The enigma will draw you in and the characters will keep you there. I liked the coming back and forth between past and present. Even the simplest details are there for a reason. The story twists and turns, making the secrets seem unresolvable. Basically, this is a story about a woman who made the wrong decision for the right reasons, with consequences that hunted down generations. The story line skips from person to person, with tossing other characters' POVs, which might irritate you if you prefer fewer POVs. There are some nasty and disturbing characters, like Linus and Adeline, and a few fundamentally wrong decisions made by characters that are otherwise likeable, like Rose and Eliza. Though the plot is predictable in some parts, it still keeps you guessing until the very end.I wasn't a big fan of Nell nor I particularly enjoyed her POVs though they held a lot of useful information. She led such a lonely life on purpose and it seemed like she punished herself for something she couldn't even be responsible for. Also, she was rude, frigid and unfriendly and because of that it was hard at first to fall in love with this book.  \u201cYou make a life out of what you have, not what you're missing.\u201d  And their lies the biggest mistake Nell made. She never fully lived her life, she constantly kept chasing what she thought she was missing and forgot that she was surrounded by people who TRULY loved her for who she is. And she just pushed them away. She constantly worried about her own feelings, but never considered others' emotions.Cassandra was okay, but had no real depth except that one tragic event, so I wasn't that much consumed in her life. She grew on me towards the end, though. She is a woman still struggling with PTSD almost 10 years later and with death of her grandmother it looks like she won't be recovering anytime soon. Eliza had such a tragic childhood. I don't even know how she survived and stayed sane. Well, half-sane. She has a good heart and means well, but everyone kept punishing her for her mother's independency. Though, those were different times, but still not everyone were that much judgemental.  \u201cA girl expecting rescue never learns to save herself.\u201d  A lesson Eliza have never quite learned. She trusted people too much and had too much faith they'll take care of her. She also had too much love in her heart, but no one to love. Her destiny is the most tragic one and she most certainly didn't deserve it. That is why her story was the most strenuous one to read about. My feelings about Rose are so contradicted. While she was growing up, I liked her and thought she was strong and not one to give up easily, but when she became a young woman, all she was is selfish and inconsiderate brat. She literally cared about no one but herself and a lot of people were hurt because of her absence of tact. Linus' mind was so twisted. I couldn't shake the feeling that if given the chance, he would've done something eternally disturbing. He was even worse than Adeline, because he kept waiting for his chance to hurt someone. Luckily, that chance never came - either because he was a coward or because he was too lazy to do anything with his life. Adeline is plainly a horrible person. I hope I never meet someone like her, because I probably won't restrain myself from teaching them a lesson. She's so unhappy, obsessive, narrow-minded, full of prejudices, egocentric and filled with negative energy. Literally, no one could breath in her company. Nathaniel was a lost artist who didn't have the guts to make decisions for himself and instead he let his mother in law to do all the hard work for him. As a consequence, he felt stuck in a dull life like he was living in a prison. I felt so sorry for him, but I still believe he's responsible for the empty life he led. Rose was too selfish to see what she was doing to Eliza. Eliza loved Rose unconditionally and Rose took advantage of that. Rose was just like her mother in the end. I'm so angry with her. Eliza literally loved Rose more than she loved herself, but for Rose she was only an asset to get her own version of happiness.Cassandra and Nell had an odd, but functional bond. Nell raised Cassandra, and she raised her right. They were both abandoned and in the constant search for their identity, which means they were each other's consolation. Nell saved Cassandra's soul when she literally didn't have will for life anymore. \u201cYou'll beat this. I know it doesn't feel like it, but you will. You're a survivor.\" \"I don't want to survive it.\" \"I know that, too,\" Nell had said. \"And it's fair enough. But sometimes we don't have a choice.\u201d  It's quite possible that someone CAN save you instead of you saving yourself.

First off if you\u2019re a Kate Morton fan you\u2019ll love it. Definitely its strongest points were the weaving of Grimm style fairytales and a hidden garden into the story; I\u2019m a sucker for both. Her characterizations are strong; Eliza Makepeace was terrific, definitely the most memorable of the lot. Other standouts included the simpering Rose & Adeline, her social climbing psycho of a mother. They were both so over-the-top weird, I found them fascinating.  not so good:  The constant jumping between different time periods and characters was annoying. Used with restraint it adds suspense, when overdone (and lets be honest she did it to death) it ruins the flow of a story. Longer chapters would have helped. This book shines as a period piece, it has this great Edwardian flavour going for it, shades of Rebecca. Was the inclusion of the time period 2005 really necessary?\u2026 So, I was over 1/2 way into it before I was hooked and it took me over 2 weeks to read a book I\u2019d normally have knocked off in 3 days. bottom-line:  This is only her 2nd novel, the lady can write\u2026I\u2019d recommend to anyone with a taste for long atmospheric gothic mysteries. This was my 1st shot at reading Kate Morton - it won\u2019t be my last. \u201cA full moon meant that the room wasn\u2019t completely dark.

It has an average rating of 4.17 stars here in Goodreads, and while I was reading it people kept sharing their love for this book and this author. \"The Forgotten Garden\" was my first book by Kate Morton, and I think it's going to be my last as well. That's because I have a feeling that once you've read one of her books, you know what her stories and her writing style is like. It's not bad at all, but it's reminiscent of so many other authors and books I've read which seem predictable and bland to me and don't really leave that much of an impression. This novel is most definitely going to be one of those novels that will stay with me for some time to come, because thinking back on it there were some points of it and some characters that I appreciated and that made me continue reading. However, my actual reading of this book left me utterly bored throughout most of it, and I was tempted to give up at several moments. The thing is that this is a 646-page book and it is structured in a way that makes you realize how it's all going to play out, right from the beginning. It's a mystery family novel going back and forth in time, leaving you with hints and bits of the whole story. Therefore, you know right from the beginning that you'll have to read all 600 pages before you get the full picture - and what's the excitement of that? A lot of the characters were predictable and caricatured in my opinion. We have the loving granddaughter, the posh mother, the mysterious father, etc. Once again, the characters didn't provide me with much excitement. However, the thing that made me keep reading were two young girls whom we don't really encounter until halfway through the book. Those girls were enchanting, and the way their destinies interweave with well-known fairy tales was beautiful. I know this might be a shock to a lot of people, but this was such a disappointment. While I do see why some people might find it captivating, I just wasn't one to share that opinion."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Such a great book!!!

Its a rich and satisfying engaging story.Given the length of this book (500+ pages)---its amazing how easy it is to retain all the many details and every new character who gets introduced (must credit the writer).This book just 'flows'. Its the type of book I would have loved to read in the winter --curled up on the couched on a few cold chilly days-- read 'non-stop'....(but I didn't have the pleasure to read it quite that fast ---yet I never forgot a thing, even when I put it down for a day (busy doing something else) --I found myself sharing every detail of this story with my husband ---as I went along --(I got so involved)I think 'maybe' the only part of the book (for me) where the writer (or editing) might have made a correction is towards the end.

I'm generally able to suspend disbelief more easily when I'm listening to an audio book.I liked the characters Kate Morton created and loved the story, a woman trying to uncover the mystery of who she is and where she came from. I also loved the period of time that was covered. The story had dark and sinister facets and I would have liked it if they had been expanded upon a little more.This story captured my attention and held it through to the end. I liked the way the author slowly revealed parts of the past so the reader knows things the characters don't, I thought this added to the suspense of the story.

Secrets, mystery, a hidden garden...these are ingredients that I love. Just not the most fortunate use for them in this plot. For one thing, this book should have been half its length - so many and not particularly beautiful descriptions, detailed rendering of unimportant gestures and unnecessary talk. And the secrets were not really secrets, I could glimpse at several possibilities, one of which turned out to be true in the end. If the mystery were deeper, the writing more alert, it would have made a perfect easy read. I made sure to be a fast read though, as I couldn't waste too much time with this book, seeing that it didn't please me the way a good book should.Some parts of the story are indeed catchy, the setting of Blackhurst estate is amazing (though I made little use of the map enclosed), but some of the characters and events are not quite believable. Nell, for one thing, behaved in a stupid manner; no matter the author's attempts to explain her behavior, I just couldn't relate to her choices. On top of that, I wasn't fond of any particular character in this novel, because they were not easy to like. If you made a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of this book, the resulting story would be interesting enough, but the 500 pages are not worth the time spent in its company, if you're looking for a gripping, fast-paced novel."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley", "userReview": "I was ready to love this book from the moment I heard about it. The Secret Garden is one of my favorite books, and stories about family secrets and hidden rooms and stuff like that are like catnip to me. And the bare bones of this story is indeed pretty satisfying. Unfortunately, the execution of it ruined most of my enjoyment, and I decided halfway through that I wasn\u2019t going to read any more of this author\u2019s books. I\u2019ve been really excited about two of her books now, and both have been completely underwhelming for the most part, and frustrating more often than not.So, no more Kate Morton for Ashley. No use trying to shove a square peg into a round hole over and over and then complaining and crying when it keeps not fitting.So anyway, the book.The Forgotten Garden follows three women through about a hundred years of history, but their narratives are all mixed up with one another so as to preserve the mystery of what actually happened until the very last minute. First, there\u2019s Nell, who was found as a little girl abandoned on a dock in Australia and taken in by a lonely childless couple, who then raised her as their own. Where did she come from, and why was she alone on that dock at four years old? Then there\u2019s her granddaughter Cassandra, who becomes wrapped up in the mystery of her grandmother\u2019s past after Nell dies and leaves Cassandra a mysterious cottage in England. And finally, there\u2019s \u201cthe authoress,\u201d aka Eliza, who is connected somehow to both women, but who is known to history for having written a collection of beloved fairy-tales and then slipping off the face of the earth.See, that sounds awesome, right? I would totally want to read that book if I read my description. Hell. I still want to read that book. Unfortunately, that book turned out to be disappointing for me for lots of reasons, among them:1. More often than not, Morton\u2019s ponderous writing goes for the obvious connections and phrasing, but seems to think them not obvious, which makes her writing and her characters have a lot of moments where they come off as having been hit by the stupid stick. It\u2019s been over a month since I finished, so I\u2019ve forgotten most of the details I could use as examples.2. It\u2019s not inconceivable that a woman (Nell) could have such an intense reaction to finding out she\u2019s been adopted after having spent her whole life believing she wasn\u2019t. But from what Morton chooses to show us of her story, Nell\u2019s reaction comes off as extreme, and makes her seem rather horrible. Sure, these people adopted her in sketchy circumstances, but that doesn\u2019t negate the fact that she loved them, they loved her, and her sisters did nothing to deserve the sudden emotional distance she put between them. Was her identity so fragile that just finding out she didn\u2019t share the same genetics with her loving family was enough to break her? I didn\u2019t buy it at all. There are more instances of lazy character work like this for most of the characters in the novel, but this one was the most egregious for me.3. I liked the idea of the alternating timelines and POVs, but Morton\u2019s sense of dramatic tension in how she deploys them was totally off. Most of the time, we would get some sort of revelatory information in Cassandra\u2019s or Nell\u2019s timelines, and then Morton would show us those same events in flashback form in excruciating length, presenting no new information when doing so. I suppose if you as a reader were super in love with the characters, this would not have been a problem for you, but I wasn\u2019t, so it was. I kept thinking, get on it with already! We just learned this five minutes ago!4. There were some moments where the story got over the top ridiculous and I physically could not stop myself from rolling my eyes. This more than anything convinced me that I should stop reading her stuff.5. Morton actually writes out several of Eliza\u2019s fairy-tales for us to read, which was sort of gutsy, because what if they sucked? They don\u2019t suck, but they also don\u2019t enchant, and I think we\u2019re meant to think they\u2019re better and more awesome than they come off. Thankfully, they aren\u2019t just there to enchant us, they also serve two other purposes: to foreshadow the overall story of the book, and to provide insight into the mystery of Eliza Makepeace and her story. They\u2019re symbolic in the world of the book, and symbolic of the book itself.I\u2019m pretty sure there was other stuff I wanted to say about this book, but it\u2019s been too long and I\u2019ve forgotten. I can see how this is a book many people would love, but I\u2019m not one of them. I would say if you\u2019re considering reading some of Kate Morton\u2019s books, this is definitely the better of the two I\u2019ve read by her, so starting here would be a good idea. If you like this one, you\u2019ll like her other books, too.[3.5 stars]"}, {"userName": "Isaura Pereira", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7219507-isaura-pereira", "userReview": "Aviso desde j\u00e1 que tudo o que possa dizer sobre este livro n\u00e3o vai fazer jus \u00e0 sua hist\u00f3ria, \u00e0 sua qualidade.
