The Anne books are more popular, but the Emily books are deeper and darker, and some of my favorite young adult literature. Like Anne, Emily is an orphan, and goes to live with conservative relations. The three books chart her coming of age, her college years and her professional endeavors, and are excellently written. Emily is a character of ups and downs -- people who dismiss L.M. Montgomery as a flowery girl's writer have never read the Emily books (or are idiots). When she finally achieves hard-won and often bittersweet success (in life, in work, in love), you are soaring with her. Montgomery's work is constantly under-estimated, and the way the books are marketed doesn't help (the flowery script, the swoony illustrations). There are many layers at work in her stories, and some pioneering feminist concepts tucked in between the deep appreciation of nature, the commentary on the stuffy contemporary society of her day, and the delightful, well-drawn characters."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Sun", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118030-stephanie-sun", "userReview": "\"Well, I never could have believed that a pack of lies could sound as much like the real truth as that book does.\"Like the handsome, ambitious boys-next-door that L.M. Montgomery's heroines love to love, Emily Byrd Starr had the bald luck of getting there first. She is the author avatar for me, and I will accept no substitutes until the day I die: Nate Zuckerman, Grady Tripp, Charlie Citrine, Harriet Vane, Briony Tallis, Stephen Daedalus, Buddy Glass, Leo Gursky, Tom Healy... it was fun, but you can let yourselves out.There is no faster way for my eyes to glaze over reading a book synopsis than to read that the MC \"is secretly writing what he hopes will be his masterwork.\" Mostly because writing about writing has already been done a dozen times well and a few thousand times badly, but also because none of these other writer-characters seem half as alive or full of single-minded drive and joy for their vocation as Montgomery's precocious, proud, witty yet dreamy young Canadian authoress. All three books of the Emily series were written in the 1920s, and although they take place prior to what was then known as the Great War, this provenance shows between the lines. Book 3, Emily's Quest, is, despite the happy ending, one of Montgomery's darkest, rivaling even her devastating World War I novel, Rilla of Ingleside.Lucy Maud Montgomery (god-fearing Christian, minister's wife, creator of plucky heroines who teach uptight spinsters How To Love) writes knowingly here of the secret pleasures and warped mind games of codependent relationships, of sleepless nights spent staring into the abyss of one's own future, of arrogance, of death, of bitterness, and of the claustrophobia of compromise.Handsome, ambitious, boy-next-door Teddy Kent spends much of the book painting and flirting his way through Montreal and Europe, leaving Emily to figure out how to build a life around the day to day grind of writing fiction alone. Emily's Quest ends up being a pretty straightforward hero's quest, but Montgomery always finds just the right detail or spin on things to meld the rigorous structure of the hero's quest seamlessly to her rural Canadian late Victorian milieu. We begin with an enthusiastic, optimistic bite of the apple, \"No more cambric tea,\" Emily declares, explaining that she has finally been deemed by her head guardian, Aunt Elizabeth, old enough to have caffeine.Soon enough Emily's enthusiasm and optimism are tested, and tested, and tested. Emily loses two of her biggest mentors and champions\u2014one to death and one to disappointed passion. The rejection slips \"damning with faint praise\" pile up, and inspiration is increasingly hard to come by. Emily begins to believe that she is just a moderately successful scribbler of pot-boilers, and nothing more.I love how quiet and slow the turnaround is, how ironic and bittersweet and true to Emily's personality and values. When Emily's first book is published, we are treated to a delightful rundown of the critical responses, paired with her relations' pricelessly folksy attempts at interpretation:\"'This book lacks spontaneity. It is saccharine and melodramatic, mawkish and naive.''I know I fell into the well,' said Cousin Jimmy pitifully. 'Is that why I can't make head or tail out of that?'\"There is so much great writing advice in this book, both of the page-level and existential kind. Montgomery gets writing. She knows how to describe writing, how to show us that Emily is a great writer, how to show us what kinds of success are attainable and what are not for a great writer, and how lonely writing has to be despite its occasional thrills of connection. Montgomery gets people too, all different kinds: bad fathers, brides with cold feet, solicitous women who want to make you in their own image, young men on the make.And if you don't like her happy ending, well, Montgomery has already had some fun with you some 100 pages back, via the character of loony fellow writer Mark Greaves:\n\"'[Y]ou must learn never to write happy endings\u2014never. I will teach you. I will teach you the beauty and artistry of sorrow and incompleteness.'\"\nTeach Lucy Maud Montgomery Emily Byrd Starr about writing? Ha! Montgomery's prose can be purple as a plum, but there is nothing left to teach a writer who knows just how much rope to give her characters to hang themselves with."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Emily's Quest (Emily of New Moon #3), L.M.

Emily fascinated me because she made some questionable decisions that I didn't immediately understand, but as the story continued I grew to understand and appreciate her. This series has all in all been such a great surprise to me because it beats \"Anne of Green Gables\" in so many ways. We get a main character who develops, who has hopes and who grows up over the span of three books. Emily goes from being a young orphan to an adult, reflective woman who doesn't just go with the flow. The setting changes throughout the trilogy as well as the characters, and all of that is was makes it the better series in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Jennis Andelin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8094758-jennis-andelin", "userReview": "This was the worst of the whole series. It was dark and depressing the whole time. The plot was really sad, and all through this book I just HATED Ilse. She was portrayed as a shallow, silly girl with no feelings for Emily or Teddy. She's obsessed with something the whole time. I liked the first two because of Emily and Ilse's good friendship. They both trust and stick up for each other. However, in the third, it seems as though she doesn't care for anything or anyone. And it's weird how Emily and Ilse are supposed to be such good friends, but Ilse doesn't sense Emily's love for Teddy EVER. How could someone be so stupid? And she's so malicious and it seems like she wants to ruin Emily's life. Finally she's engaged to Teddy and then runs off to Perry while he's in the hospital supposedly \"dying.\" How could someone so shallow and mean and uncaring love anyone like that? I just hated her, which was sad because in the other two I really liked her personality. The third book ruined all her good characteristics and her bad ones took over.Teddy and Emily's relationship? Stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid. They didn't know how to communicate, and they can't read each other at all. I was mad at both of them the whole time for being so dumb. I guess people are really like that, but still...Dean? I hated him. Sorry to be a hater...but he was so self-absorbed, selfish, and cynical. When he lies to Emily about her story and then she goes and burns it...I wanted to put the book down. Why did she trust him so much?? Emily was such a bad judge of character.The plot was SO SAD. oh....my...goodness. Emily loses her good outlook on life and I feel like she becomes sarcastic and cynical. And I get sick of all the writing. It seems like her life is only this: writing, get up, walk in the garden with Dean, talk, eat, sleep, write. I mean, it gets to a point where I hate her life. And when it says that she was content and happy with her cats and her life at new moon, everyone knew that she was going to be an old maid now, the only times that she was sick of her life was when she was reading Teddy and Ilse's letters and adventures, yada yada yada. How can you not hate her life? And all these sad things happen and the happy parts are few and far between. Mr. Carpenter dies, Emily falls down the stairs and cuts open her foot with sewing scissors (*shudder*), Emily has a horrible life...etc. The humor is really weird sometimes...like the one part where the man comes and proposes to her because he falls madly in love with her picture...and during his proposal he talks about how she ruined his story but he still loves her...what the...?I cried during this book. I cried because Emily had a horrible, boring, depressing life. Everyone judged her wrongly and she NEVER tried to defend herself! Sure, the ending is happy, but that's like what...five pages of happiness? The rest is really depressing and hard to get through. I hate almost all the characters at some point in the story. The only reason I kept reading was because I had to see how it ended. I couldn't stand how the whole time the tone was depressing and nostalgic, and the story just ends with tons of loose ends. It was my least favorite L.M. book so far."}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/841949-tracey", "userReview": "Reading Emily of New Moon I began to have an idea of why I've never loved and spent time with Emily Byrd Starr as I have with Anne Shirley or Pat Gardiner. I began to suss it out then, but I loved the book and it still seemed strange to me. With Emily Climbs it began to seem clearer \u2013 that dark streak running through it, I said, and left it at that. But it is only on finishing Emily's Quest that I fully understand \u2013 and that is partly because I know, on closing this book, I will be leaving it closed for possibly another twenty years. Whether I have the moral courage to read it then will be interesting to see \u2013 almost like Emily's fortitude in reading her letter from her fourteen-year-old self to herself at twenty-four, except unlike the very young Emily I know the pain within the pages aimed twenty years ahead. There is pain in the other books, deep and seemingly impassible, and I always cry over the other books (Matthew\u2026). I recognize myself in Valancy, heaven knows, and Anne and Pat, and so their pain is very real to me. But it is their pain. The pain that laces through Emily is personal. I have never read L.M. Montgomery's journals or memoirs or letters, so I don't know if my reading is true, but it feels as though a great deal of Emily comes from Lucy Maude. I find it hard to believe, for one thing, that the snippets of reviews Emily reads to her staunchly supportive family aren't true to life. My feeling is that while the specifics of the circumstances of the years spanned in Quest are wholly fictional, wholly Emily's own, the emotions are not in the least fictional. Fictionalized. After decades loving Anne and Pat and Valancy, still I can't help but identify most strongly of all with Emily \u2013 and it is the Emily in this book that brings me to tears. Alone, and left alone, and in no small way responsible for that aloneness, but knowing that there was no other action or set of actions that would have ever been tolerable in any given situation. \"I have not heard even from Ilse for a long time. She has forgotten me, too.\" I know that feeling well. That was the feeling \u2013 of having been forgotten in general, compounded with actually being told by someone I held dear that he had forgotten about me, that caused me to \u2013 as someone wise recently said \u2013 be still and lock the gate from the inside. I walked away then and made some decisions and will hold to them. My locks might get a bit rusty. Facing the daily struggle against the inner demon editor who insists that every word written is trash, or worse, that no one will read this nonsense, that \u2026 well. She was, obviously, far more successful in ignoring or silencing that voice than I ever have been, or, at times, ever hope to be. It's funny, though, and I apologize for a spoiler, but even Emily's greatest literary triumph to date was painful to me; I haven't finished a book, much less had it rejected by uncounted publishers, but I know that if I did, and gave up as Emily does, there is no Uncle Jimmy figure in my life to pull it out of storage and send it out again. So I wonder, in a way, that I didn't love these books more when I was the age of Emily (book two). An artist of extraordinary talent, when I wanted to be, planned to be an artist; a writer heroine, when I already was scribbling a little here and there; hard work leading to success and happiness. It should all have appealed, then. Now \u2026 the pain is too real, and the abruptly happy ending not as easy to swallow. It's a beautiful book, and a beautiful trilogy \u2026 but not for the young and hopeful, or the \u2026 what? Not-so-young and futile-feeling. Perhaps it's for those who have been through the pain and persevered better than I have. For me? I think Emily is going to go into a box, and the box is going to be set at the back of a shelf, and the dust will collect on it, and \u2013 no. I won't even express the hope that one day I'll read them again without the ache. On the shelf they'll stay."}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "Another wonderful book by Lucy Maud Montgomery.

I have never read a story where I so wholly absorbed a character's feelings as I did Emily Starr's. And I must say, the final book in the trilogy broke my heart over, and over, and over. I felt so much anguish over this book.But L.M. Montgomery done something special. Reading this alongside Anne of Green Gables, it is evident how much her writing has evolved since the Anne series (1908 versus the 1920s). Montgomery cut back a lot of her flowery passages seen in Anne and brought forth challenging and bold themes into the Emily books. You can see how the changing attitudes of the Roaring Twenties influence Montgomery's ideals in that the books contain new themes like sexuality, depression, and human cruelty. This book particularly introduces a number of characters that are not to be simplified. I don't think I will ever be able to figure out how I feel about Dean Priest.There are so many things I wish I could say about this book and this series, but reading it was honestly kind of overwhelming in a way that makes it difficult for me to find words for why it hit me the way it did. That phenomenon is a particular gift of Montgomery's because it is evident that she felt things keenly in her life. Her ability to manifest those feelings in her characters is all too effective. While I think this is possibly her strongest work, I don't think it would appeal to a wide audience, especially if one enters into it expecting something with the levity of Anne of Green Gables."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9136620-jessica", "userReview": "Poor Emily. Poor, poor Emily. I picked up this book again last night, meaning to read a few chapters over dinner, and found myself ripping right through it again, back in PEI with silly, proud, devastating Emily.This book guts me every time, probably because I am also a writer who has experienced major depression. Emily's Quest is one of the most honest, accurate depictions of the illness I've ever read, and gave me, as a child and adolescent, if not a name for what I was experiencing, then at least a feeling that it was real. Other reviewers have criticized the bleak and mundane first half of the book, but that it what depression is - bleak, mundane, seemingly unending. I appreciated growing up, and still do, the fact that Emily doesn't go insane and cut her hair off, or brood poetically in her own sadness - she's deeply and quietly suffering from being \"an outcast from her own starry kingdom\", suddenly shunted from a world of creative faculty and imagination into a tedious grind in which no lightness or fancy can enter. Her suffering is boring, which is a dramatic risk but about as true to experience as you can get.Rereading it, I also have an increased sympathy for Dean Priest - not a popular opinion around these parts, but there it is. He's just such a fascinating and tragic character. He's wealthy, intelligent, and travelled, but instead of settling into a fulfilling intellectual life in London or Paris, returns again and again to a provincial town in Canada where he is mocked for his minor disability and is spiritually and intellectually isolated. What is it that drives this choice? We are given at least an insight into Emily's compulsion to make poor choices and then punish herself for them, but we never see what leads Dean into his own personal bell jar. Don't get me wrong, his actions are pretty reprehensible, but if you are in love with a child? What then? Wait for her to become an adult, and cheat your way into a facsimile of happiness? Of all of Emily's silly choices, I find her resolution to marry Dean the cruelest - she knows what it means to him, and that he is so desperate for a real connection that he'll settle for a second-rated, watered down version of her love. It's just horrible all around, and one of the hardest chapters of the book to read.I've never really been that invested in Teddy, only wanting him for Emily because she wanted him so desperately. The happy ending I can take or leave - for me the real happy ending is Emily's recovery or her ability to write, her \"coming alive\" again after her own spiritual death. I know that coming alive, too, and I am every thankful to L.M. Montgomery for giving Emily the grace to recover her sense of creativity and self."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54041-michelle", "userReview": "Oh, God, Emily, shut up.

For most of the book I was convinced she knew you loved Teddy (b/c DUH) and she was just trying a bunch of clever ways to pull it out of you. But, nope, that's not it. She gives up on Perry and becomes engaged to Teddy. WHHHAAAAATTTT? I hated this so much. Not as much as I hate Dean, but I felt like, Girls? Are you really best friends? Your friendship is horrible. And you are partly to blame, Emily. Communicate your feelings maybe????(3) Teddy. I cannot even with you. (4) Emily. You are just as dumb as Teddy. I suppose it's good you do end up together after all (after three or four opportunities to admit their love; honestly, it was maddening); you really deserve each other.Everybody talks about how great this book is because it's dark, depressing, mature, etc., and that can be quite a departure from the usual Montgomery books. But I didn't feel like that at all. It just felt like a giant lesson in why you should just express your feelings. And, yes, I understand this was a different time, but Emily was really just being silly to me. Teddy is whistling for you--just go. Teddy is trying to hold your hand--just hold hands. You feel like it's weird that he didn't write you a letter. You can just, I don't know, say that in a letter to him? Stop being so Victorian and weird, Emily. It's exhausting."}, {"userName": "Laurence R.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32492014-laurence-r", "userReview": "I ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS BOOK."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1146941-kate", "userReview": "Emily's Quest was just so incredibly depressing and frustrating, I really found it difficult to read with any pleasure. The misunderstandings between Emily and Teddy (and Ilse) are so very obvious, and could have been so easily sorted out. Instead, the creepy Dean Priest steps in and persuades Emily to marry him after she is badly hurt in an accident (which Priest unwittingly precipitated, but then used to his advantage).The final third of the book was the hardest to read as the misunderstandings are compounded, and the friends grow apart. It is only in the final chapter that things are made right, but even this is rushed and doesn't actually feel like the redemption of the star crossed lovers in the way it should.Unlike the other LMM books, I can't actually see myself reading this again, as it actually made me feel uncomfortable and sad."}, {"userName": "Adrian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/999192-adrian", "userReview": "After two strong books, L.M. Montgomery ruins the finish in this book. People do horrible things to her and break her heart, and she finishes as a very weak version of herself. I can only take so many \"miscommunications\" as plot devices, and this story has a few too many. Also, we are presented with the fact that Emily loves only Teddy Kent, and can't possibly marry anyone else, but in spite of the fact that Emily really is a well written character, we know very little about Teddy Kent, and so it's hard to believe the fact that they were meant to be together in the end. The first two books deserved a better ending than this."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/591339-leslie", "userReview": "This was my first time rereading this book since high school, and I had some major issues with it that I don't remember from earlier readings. Emily was driving me crazy with her pride and stubbornness - I kind of felt like she didn't really deserve to get the guy if she was so unwilling to sacrifice even the tiniest bit of pride and admit to her feelings. Same with Ilse - if she had ever given Perry the slightest indication that she even liked him a little bit as a person instead of ragging on him all the time, maybe it would have occurred to him to consider her as a romantic prospect. I also felt like Dean didn't deserve the sympathy that Emily and L.M. Montgomery gave him - they may have forgiven him for his need to possess Emily completely, but I certainly didn't! It wasn't just the lie that caused her to burn her book that I had issues with - it was his constant belittling of Emily's writing and ambitions. That was emotional abuse right there, I don't care how stimulating his conversation was. I still gave it three stars for nostalgia's sake. I do still think it's a pretty good read, even if I was tearing my hair out at the way these people were acting."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3216-danielle", "userReview": "This was probably my least favorite of the three books. That being said, it was completely necessary for the course of the story to play out. This book is more full of mental hardship than previous books (Emily is growing up after all), which makes for a more difficult read. Not that difficult is bad, but after coming to love such a vibrant, positive character and then see that character mentally anguished for some period of time. No one wants to see someone they care about in pain, and I definitely do care about Emily. My one real complaint is that the very end of the book (and series) seems almost anti-climactic. After an entire book full of waiting, seemingly lasting forever at times, and then the conclusion is all of two pages long! I need details woman! L.M. seems perfectly happy to give us a million details of the scenery and the knickknacks on the shelves, but the culmination of a three book series is wrapped up in just 2 pages! L.M. mocks me!

We have to have this book because it winds up the love story, but it takes us briefly through some harrowing, depressing events to get there. No one dies, but it's rough. Scratch that. People die, all right, but Emily doesn't. I still love Emily's story even though, as an adult, I no longer believe it's a good story for me to read. I don't need any more encouragement to judge, be introverted, and stay away from people. I need encouragement to go and DO things. Anne of Green Gables is still the best book of Montgomery's, chock full of perfect sentences, stories, and antics. Emily is more tragic and melodramatic. And this time around, I thought the ending gave short shrift to the resolution the reader deserved.Still. I love Emily."}, {"userName": "Rikke", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4327582-rikke", "userReview": "This is a tale of a young heroine's quest for succes. It is a tale of ambition and of a young woman obsessed with wordplay and poetry. It is a tale of bleak depression and the writer's block that comes along with it. It is a tale of artistry and the fragility with which art is created. And, of course, it is a tale of love and hope and happiness; a tale of rereading old letters and striving for the bright future, that was once foretold.\u201cThe ghosts of things that never happened are worse than the ghosts of things that did.\u201d This book has always resonated deeply with me. Even when I was a child who hardly understood that Emily's long period of writer's block is actually a sign of deep depression, and that Ilse's gay adventures with Emily only proves how far they've drifted apart.I suspect I loved this book dearly back then, because of the love story. The intense attraction between Teddy and Emily; their many misunderstandings; and Dean Priest who creates a place for himself in Emily's sorrow, makes for an epic love story. Add in the admiration of princes, writers and a hidden diamond in the grass \u2013 and you have a fairy tale that will enchant any 11-year old.Teddy Kent will always be one of my favorite heroes; even though upon rereading this, it is hard to explain why. He is, as Ilse would say, selfish. He cares as little for Emily's writing as Dean does, and his characterization seems oddly vague compared to Perry's bursting personality. As Teddy is a quiet creature, who Emily doesn't even dare to look at, fearing to expose her feelings, he is only describe through Emily's thoughts, not through direct interaction. Montgomery seems to contrast her characterization; where as Perry and Ilse are often described through direct and merry scenes and rarely in Emily's diary, Teddy's personality is mainly to be found in Emily's diary. In that way, Montgomery allows Emily to describe Teddy. To the reader, he is a creature of Emily's own pen. And therefore, a fragment of her own mind.\u201cDon't be led away by those howls about realism. Remember-pine woods are just as real as pigsties and a darn sight pleasanter to be in.\u201d But, while Teddy Kent holds my heart (and Emily's), he has only a small part of this book. This is a tale of an authoress; of wordplay, writing and rewriting, and ultimately a loss of words. Emily falls into depression, lays down her pen and makes a terrible decision. Montgomery spins a vivid tale of how much an artist suffers without ways to express their feelings. Emily is numb for so long, she is willing to marry a man she doesn't love, just so she can let him take hold of her life, leaving her no decisions of her own.Emily uses Dean cruelly; she adds on to the pain and loneliness, he has experienced through his own life. And while Dean is painted to be the villain in this, one cannot feel entirely sorry for him. Like Mrs. Kent, he falls victim to his own jealousy, the symptom of a broken and a love-starved soul. Like Mrs. Kent, he clings on too tightly. One of the many themes that runs through this book, showcasing the bitter and ugly side of depending on someone too much.Another reason, this book still resonates with me, is the fine thread of nostalgia that runs through the novel. Emily, staying behind in Blair Water, is constantly confronted with the ghost of things past. Ilse visits in a whirlwind of laughter and colors, and always leaves with a sigh; concluding that the careless summers of their childhood cannot be replicated. Perry keeps proposing to Emily out of sheer habit, Elizabeth, Laura and Jimmy constantly laments that their little Emily has been replaced with a young woman. Even the cats grow old, beloved mentors die and Emily is left alone, feeling deserted and betrayed by time.When Emily finds the young and hopeful letters of her 14-year old self adressing her 24-year old self, she almost cannot bear to read it. The hope and wonder, the letter is written with, is almost poisonous. The 14-year old Emily envies her older self; and yet the 24-year old Emily finds herself longing to be 14 again. To be a happy child with an endless future. I almost feel like I'm reading a letter from a younger version of myself, whenever I reread Montgomery's words. I loved these books, and Emily herself, so much as a child, it only takes a reread to take me back. The feeling is bittersweet; leaving me a bit nostalgic myself for times that has long passed, for the 14-year old version of me reading these pages and wondering who I would be at 24. Would I be an author like Emily? Married to the love of my life? A mother? A writer? Both? Neither? While I'm not an Emily, she is a part of me. And has been ever since I read this book for the very first time.\u201cNever be silent with persons you love and distrust ... Silence betrays.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Martin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4758063-martin", "userReview": "Wow. What a disappointment. I started the series this summer and thought the first book was charming and lovely and I looked forward to more, and then the second made me wonder how Montgomery was going to wrap it all up. I was less enamoured with the second, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt, thinking perhaps it suffered from the sort of 'bridge' story that's necessary in trilogies.But wow. The story just devolved into a silly steaming pile that I'm kinda surprized I got through. It reads almost like a serial... like Montgomery contrived a couple of situations and played each one out in its turn. I felt like she'd totally run out of ideas for this group of characters and was finishing this series only for the money. It felt like she didn't care about them, and so neither did I.Even the points that were made in the first book, like the finding of the diamond, which I expected would be a huge thing were just barely there stories and no one in the book cared, and so neither did I. The whole thing was wrapped in a couple pages. I thought it'd be a way bigger story.Montgomery also pretty much got rid of all the supporting characters, having them show up only periodically throughout the novel, and in the case of Ilse, turn into complete idiots. This left Emily with nothing to do, so instead we have a romance and near-marriage to a guy who used to be friends with Emily's *dad*. Creepy, much?The whole thing was so stupid that by the time we got to the end of the book and it finally resolved in the way everyone knew it was going to resolve in spite of the pointless twists and turns and unexplained and barely explored supernatural abilities Emily possessed, I just didn't give a damn. Emily could have married Old Kelly and it wouldn't have made the story any less stupid.The series was like The Matrix films. Watch and enjoy the first.

Yet as I read through these again and again, I find this third one to be the darkest and most depressing. Emily has given up a chance to work in publishing in the U.S. to stay at New Moon and write -- while this is her choice (and the author's) what a book that would have made, to see Emily in the world! Plus the author makes the years pass by like fluid and, through a couple of misunderstandings and Emily's ridiculous pride, seems to torture her characters needlessly, finishing up with a rushed happy ending. Ugh. Her writing is still beautiful but nothing much happens, and my one complaint about Montgomery is that all her characters are afflicted with the vice of pride, and it seriously gets old. On the other hand it does teach the reader the value of good communication, no matter the century! If you like the first two you ought to read this one too.

One is a young, handsome, artsy but shallow man with curly locks. The other man is noticeably older and sadder, and not conventionally handsome, but he understands the heroine\u2019s artistic struggles and he feels things much more deeply than the boy can.Jo rejects Laurie in favor of Friedrich, and grows as a person because of it. Emily rejects Dean in favor of Teddy, ensuring that she will never again be uncomfortable or reevaluate her worldview ever again. Yippee.Emily\u2019s Quest is written in Montgomery\u2019s later style\u2014fragmented, full of haunting descriptions and amusing journal entries/letters, but disjointed and sometimes barely coherent.In this book, Teddy\u2014arguably the blandest man in fiction\u2014goes away to art school in Montreal, and Emily, who can run circles around him mentally, pines for him. She tries to focus on her writing and gets a lot of rejections. She also mourns the loss of her dear teacher and mentor, Mr. Carpenter.Then a severe injury leaves her laid up for several months, and Dean Priest sits faithfully at her bedside all that while, talking and reading and resonating with her. He admits his true feelings to her, she accepts his offer, they become engaged and buy the Disappointed House that has so fascinated her since moving to Blair Water.Dean has been nothing but supportive and a little awed, albeit possessive, of Emily so far, but he suddenly turns as dismissive of her writing as Casaubon was of Dorothea\u2019s attempts at scholarship in \nMiddlemarch\n. It\u2019s completely out of character. It\u2019s meant to make us hate Dean just in time and ship Emily with Teddy \u201cCardboard Cutout\u201d Kent. I have the highest respect for Maud usually, but this is nothing short of jamming the story through the Ivory Gate. It\u2019s such a cheap, obvious trick that Rick Riordan or Cassandra Clare could use it.And then, not even halfway through the book, Emily has one of her psychic dreams about Teddy and breaks it off with Dean. Dean completely disappears from the story after this, and without him it devolves into an inane love square involving Emily, Teddy, Ilse (who goes from being amusing to loathsome in this installment), and Perry. This subplot concludes in one of the very silliest deus ex machinas I\u2019ve ever read.There are a few triumphant moments. Emily\u2019s first book gets published, and it\u2019s appropriately epic.She also gets a number of marriage proposals, one from a gothishly handsome and utterly insane writer named Mark Delange Greaves. He shows up out of nowhere and promptly goes back there, but what fun he was! He left a story unfinished, and his publisher gave it to Emily to tie up in order to fit the deadline. Mark hated the grafted ending and went to New Moon to give its writer a piece of his mind, but he winds up smitten with her brilliance and spooky beauty, proposes to her on the spot, and breaks an heirloom crystal goblet when refused before storming back down the hill with his black hair and matching cape flying behind him. He is W.B. Yeats meets Kylo Ren. Seriously, Em, if you don\u2019t want Dean, take this guy. He\u2019s stark raving nuts, and you will never be bored.But that brings us to the problem here. Dean is Emily\u2019s soulmate, the Yin to her Yang, the Hades to her Persephone, the answer to her question. They fit together perfectly, and Montgomery, in a rare moment for her of not letting the story run its natural course, pries them cruelly and senselessly apart.I\u2019m glad I read this trilogy and I still dearly love the first two books. But oh, how I wish it had ended differently!"}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6147556-nancy", "userReview": "Emily's character writes and studies human nature, but when it came to her own life, she couldn't communicate, with the people she loved. It was maddening to read, and not scream out to Emily, that she needed to express her feelings, in order for her dreams to come true. Why didn't Emily see how much Teddy loved her, through his many paintings of her face in his works?I felt throughout the book, that Emily would be the person to help Teddy's mother, and I was glad that happened. Ilse was Emily's friend, but many times she seemed just the opposite. Why didn't Ilse know that Emily loved Teddy? It seemed she was rubbing salt into Emily's wounds when she talked about Teddy. Emily couldn't see that Dean's interest in her was much more than friendship. After she rejected his love, she still wanted and needed his friendship, which he could no longer give her. I'm glad I found this series of books by Lucy Maud Montgomery, but Anne of Green Gables is still my favorite character. I will read the authors biography, and go on to her other books."}], "description": "Emily knows she's going to be a great writer.
