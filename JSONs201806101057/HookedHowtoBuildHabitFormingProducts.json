Given that I think daily about how to make Goodreads better and more engaging for people, this was a useful book. I think I knew a lot of it already, but often being forced to think about things again can be useful - and there are a few useful new ways of thinking about things that I learned. One of the main useful ideas the book talks about in engaging users is having triggers to bring the user back to the product. This can be an external trigger - like an email or notification or ad that brings the user back - but the best products also form internal triggers. Ever get bored or lonely and find yourself on Facebook? Or wondering what is happening in the world and end up on Twitter? Or see something beautiful or inspiring and then pull out Instagram? Or feel the need to escape and relax and open a book or turn on a movie or a sports game? Our emotions often drive our behavior, and each emotion is mapped to a set of products we could use to \"scratch the itch\" of whatever we are feeling. These mappings become habits. \"Once a technology has created an association in users\u2019 minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.\"I think my favorite external triggers mentioned in the book were from the bible app example, where it sent a push notification to people if they walked into a strip club! And it sent another one on xmas day that did well. Timely matters!Nir then talks about how to get users to take actions. The framework is obvious, but very true, and useful to remember when evaluating products. It's fairly well summed up in the below quote. There was a lot of good discussion about point #2 in terms of having simple design, being mobile, etc.there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.\"Another point Nir makes around actions - which is also an obvious one but worth really paying attention to when designing a product - is around getting frequent engagement with a product when a user is new to it.\"For new behaviors to really take hold, they must occur often.\"\"frequent engagement with a product\u2014especially over a short period of time\u2014increases the likelihood of forming new routines.\"The author then talks about variable rewards. I've known that variability - or serendipitousness as I like to think of it - is a very important driver of any engaging product. It's why we love sports, gambling, games, Facebook newsfeed, and good stories - not knowing what we'll find is exciting. Nir breaks down variable rewards into three types - the tribe, the hunt, and the self. The tribe is social validation - think of Facebook likes on content you posted. The hunt is something intrinsic in our brains that dates back to prehistoric times when we literally lived for the hunt - think of hunting for interesting content on your Twitter feed, or gambling looking for payoffs. The self is more for personal gratification - wanting to complete a puzzle you started or beat a video game you started."}, {"userName": "Ted", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1477685-ted", "userReview": "Update: I ended up publishing a longer version of this - with a discussion of the trend towards more addictive technology in the tech industry more broadly - on the Huffington Post. It covers a lot of the same stuff in this review, but is likely a bit more polished: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ted-mcc...----------------I\u2019ve heard a great deal about this book in the past month - first, I saw Eyal give a talk here in San Francisco (I hadn't heard of him, but someone recommended I go - the talk was sold out and a spot opened up), then someone at a meeting mentioned the book/talk and said it was 'amazing', then the other day I heard him featured on an episode of Planet Money. At least within the tech scene, it seems this book is very well-known, and that, to some extent, scares me. (And to put that into context, I'm a technology designer/researcher - i.e., I'm the kind of person who should be absolutely frothing at the mouth (happily) about this thing.)Most of the reviews I've been seeing have been addressing Eyal's execution of the 'Hooked' concept, which I'd give something like a 2.5 - the ideas are clearly expressed, but the writing is fairly dumbed down, and the book's ideas could (and given his writing style, should) have been expressed in about a quarter of the length.My biggest problem with the book is its basic premise, that 'hooking' people - that is, making them compulsive users of your technology product - is something worth doing. Eyal makes a number of assumptions about the benefits of technology here - he commonly alludes to Facebook, Instagram, et al as 'solving' our feelings of loneliness, for instance. Among many other occurrences, a line in the book says Instagram \"helps users dispel boredom by connecting them with others.\" Everything about technology use is placed in a positive light - 'solving' problems, 'connecting' users. It's the standard litany of Silicon Valley Tech Speak, but bumped up a great many RPMs and set on continuous repeat.The idea of 'hooking' a user to your product is strikingly similar to that of causing a user 'to be addicted' to your product, including use of the same mechanisms to do it. The third piece of the 'hook' cycle is the use of variable rewards to help make users habitual users of your product, for example - this is the exact mechanism that makes gambling so potentially addictive. Even the book's cover art shows a mouse pointer clicking somewhere near the nucleus accumbens of a brain, the dopamine center manipulated by variable rewards that help fuel behavioral addictions. Eyal discusses how, in the 1950's, Olds and Milner would stimulate mice in this region, and see them forgo food and water in exchange for more stimulation. (Think 'Infinite Jest', with mice in cages.) If his book espouses manipulation, at least he's (relatively) honest about it.Eyal discusses - very briefly, at the very end of his talk/book - the morality of manipulating people in this way, and of causing, if you successfully carry out his formula and do everything else right, your users to develop behavioral addictions to your product. But his discussion of morality is too little, too late - during his talk, he spends forty minutes discussing how his model will allow audience members to build the next Facebook, and then five minutes pleading with them to use this information only to improve the world. \"Basically, I want you all to use this for good,\" he begs, and then quotes Gandhi (yes, really), \"Be the change you wish to see in the world.\" (The Mahatma, by the way, apparently never actually said this.) That's about it. When I saw the talk, I suspected he added this bit at the end to appease sane-minded audience members and prevent heckling.In the book, at least, Eyal includes a short chapter near the end discussing the morality of this approach, and, perhaps as a way of showing how his 'hooked' formula can be used for good, a case study illustrating how a Bible app - YouVersion - carries out (more or less) the four steps of the hooked model. (The chapter also employs a nauseating number of religious puns: \"Switching to a different digital Bible - God forbid...\"; \"Gruenewald's app is a Godsend\", ad nauseum.) But it's unconvincing; and it's perhaps telling that the best positive example Eyal can find of a technology product achieving good with his model is 'getting people to read the Bible more', which is dubious at best. I understand that this kind of thing happens all the time - you'd better believe that Facebook, Google, and many other technology companies are many steps ahead of even Eyal in this game. But it bothers me to see it filtered down and formulatized in a set of followable steps. It might bother me less if Eyal emphasized the ways in which this could be used for good throughout the book - for health behavior change, for instance, an area of technology design that's quickly growing and has shown potential for doing actual good. Eyal references Sunstein and Thaler's 'Nudge', another book I just finished (and one that I highly recommend). Those authors also present methods that could be seen as manipulative, but are careful to include frank and lengthy discussions on how to morally employ these techniques - not a hollow plea to 'only do good' with the methods followed by a flippant reading of a Gandhi quote. The authors of 'Nudge', moreover, fill the book with case studies in which their concept has - or at least, can - produce real, substantial benefit for great numbers of people. That book deserves attention and praise - people should be paying attention to *that* one.Paul Graham has somewhat famously said (Eyal even references it) that \"The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.... and the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40. We'll increasingly be defined by what we say no to.\" It bothers me greatly to see a book outlining *how* to make the world more addictive - and weakly excusing itself for doing so - seeing such success, especially here in Silicon Valley, where people designing products that 'touch people's lives' are only learning how to do so more effectively, more thoroughly, more persistently, more addictively."}, {"userName": "AnneMarie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26821377-annemarie", "userReview": "There is buzz about this book in the SF tech scene.

It is full of speculation and misleading 'information'. It has a very big fluff to substance ratio and the little substance it does present is deprived of all nuance. Arguably, that isn't reason enough to give it one star. The determining factor is the authors tendency of quoting studies and then misrepresenting the findings. For example: a study of the internet usage of 216 students. The study, conducted over the course of a month, found correlation between increased internet usage and indicators of depression. The author of the book presents this correlation with a much greater degree of certainty, he exaggerates the duration of the study, cites methodology that isn't found in the study, selects one possible hypothesis: depressed people use the internet more because it makes them feel better and runs with it, expanding this theory with lush examples of solace seeking Instagram users. The study itself only mentions that it notices an increased number of \"chat octets\" in the traffic analysis and one of the possible explanations is that depressive people are joining depression chat rooms in order to find relief (but they have no way of knowing). I find this kind of mistreatment of research and scientific certainty repulsive."}, {"userName": "WhatIReallyRead", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52500467-whatireallyread", "userReview": "This book is great.

At the end of the book he provides citations, lists scientific studies and articles he mentions. Little personal opinion, a lot of useful info. It's curious how the tech-related psychological research lines up neatly with what I've recently read about psychology of relationships.

I've been reading Nir's blog for a while now so was already a fan. Nir and Ryan do a great job of bringing everything together in the Hooked process and laying it out in a logical and motivating way. The book takes you through the theory, giving examples to bring the theory alive and then provides exercises at the end of each chapter to help you take what you've learned and immediately apply it to your own product or service. It was refreshing to see a lot of new stories/examples in between some of the familiar ones. I particularly loved all of the psychology behind habits. Hooked introduced me to the concept of reactance (in the psychology sense). Pretty powerful stuff.

As technology becomes increasingly available to entrepreneurs of all backgrounds, design has become just as important as engineering. Correspondingly, all entrepreneurs should have a good understanding of the principals behind building habit-forming products. In that respect, this book does a great job. This book may not provide any grand revelations or have particularly unique/fascinating case studies, but it is still very valuable (thus the 3 stars, perhaps closer to 3.5). Below I've provided an outline of my notes on the book so that those of us less inclined to read this can still learn the basics. I do still recommend reading the book for the useful examples and exercises at the end of the chapters (which you most definitely should do). I highly recommend reading the book with a specific product in mind that you would like to apply the lessons of Hooked to. The basic idea behind Hooked is the Hook Model. The model consists of four parts:-Trigger-Action-Variable Reward-InvestmentQuite simply, using a trigger should prompt a user to take an action that results in a variable reward, followed by further investment. This cycle should continue to repeat itself until the user becomes 'hooked'. TriggerThe trigger is what makes a user turn to your product. If there isn't a trigger, then what will prompt the user to engage with your product? Nir Eyal explains that there are two types of triggers: external and internal triggers. While external triggers such as an app icon or an advertisement can be useful in getting a user to use your product, truly addictive products use internal triggers. An internal triggers is usually a feeling or emotion that prompts an action to resolve that feeling or emotion. It is easy to see the power of internal triggers. They are omnipresent and a constant part of our lives. Further, it is internal triggers that are the basis of true habit formation on a biological level. Nir Eyal explains:In the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned association in the user's memory.There are numerous examples of this. People use snapchat and instagram to resolve their fear of missing out. People use reddit or facebook to resolve their boredom. Have you ever wondered how you just magically seemed to end up using one of these products? It's because it forms a subconscious habit linked with an emotion. So, when building your product make sure to find the internal trigger that you should have your product be associated with it. That is the first step.ActionNow that you have the trigger, as soon as a user feels that 'itch' your product will pop into their head. But that alone is not enough. It is just as important to make sure that it is easy enough to 'scratch' that itch. The action to do that needs to be a simplistic as possible. After all, if habits are subconscious then it will have to be relatively simple. The book describes the following factors that should be taken into account:There are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to completed the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the actionIt is important to focus on motivation and ability. Motivation is often in the form of resolving the emotion associated with the trigger. Ability is where there is much room for innovation. Consider companies like Blogger and Twitter. They made the action of writing significantly easier by reducing the steps necessary to resolve the trigger. This led to massive success. It is important that your action is as simple as possible. Variable RewardNow that the user has engaged with your product, it is important to reward them. All habits end with a reward. When you post a picture on instagram, the reward is likes from other people. When you complete your diary for the day on MyFitnessPal, the reward is a nice message telling you about how successful you've been. Even bad habits have 'rewards'. Cigarettes give you a nicotine high and alcohol can make it feel like your problems are solved (but of course not really). Thus, your product not only has to make it easy to scratch that itch... it must also relieve that itch, but that alone is not enough. The rewards need to be variable. Nir Eyal gives many examples and explanations, but the best is Skinner's Pigeon Experiment. In the experiment there are two groups. One is a group of pigeons that are in a cage where if they press a button they will be given some food pellets, but the amount of food dispensed is the same every time. The second group has the same setup, but is given a variable reward every time; sometimes there is more food and sometimes there is less. Skinner found that adding variability significantly increased the frequency of the pigeons pressing the button. Nir Eyal writes:Skinner's pigeons tell us a great deal about what helps drive our own behaviors. More recent experiments reveal that variability increases activity in the nucleus accumbens and spikes levels of neurotransmitter dopamine, driving our hungry search for rewards.There are many products that inherently do this. For example, on facebook you never know if you'll find good content in the feed or how many likes your status will get. The same phenomenon happened with the early version of Zynga games. So for even stronger habits, a variable reward is necessary.InvestmentThe final step of the Hooked Model is what differentiates it from the traditional Habit Loop (see  The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business). In order to ensure that users come back to your product, it is important to ask the users to make an investment. By making an investment, users will yet another reason to come back to your product, instead of someone else's. There are many products out there that are better than facebook. But, by having users store their data on there and make friends and comment on other people's data it makes it difficult for users to leave. Nir Eyal explains that in studies user's value their own work 4x more than work of higher quality:Those who invested labor associated greater value with their creations simply because they had worked on them. Ariely calls this the IKEA effect. By having your user invest in your product, it makes repeat usage more likely."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7236889-scott", "userReview": "As a product designer, this book is a perfect introduction to behavioral product psychology. It\u2019s written in a humble and inquisitive tone. The objective literary style spoke to my research-based soul. I'm constantly seeking to follow the works (and words) of those who are solving real problems in the world. Nir Eyal is one of them. I definitely recommend the book. It\u2019s a quick read, with the feel of an extended blog post (my only criticism, really). After completing Hooked, I emailed Nir to thank him for his wise words.

Being a psychologist that works in user experience design, I at first was not sure how much I'd gain from a book written on a subject I consider myself to have deep knowledge of. However, I found it to be a great book and I did learn a lot. I'd recommend this book for anyone that's interested in learning how psychological mechanisms can be used to form habits, and therefore keep people \"hooked\" on their products."}, {"userName": "Kartik Santhanakrishnan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18409907-kartik-santhanakrishnan", "userReview": "I'll start with a complaint because I want to get my grumpiness out of the way before I take it out on someone at work. This book should have been 50% as long as it is. Perhaps even shorter. Do authors seriously think that more words is the same as getting your point across? In all fairness, there were synopses at appropriate places in the book, so you could skip any nonsense and go through just salient points. Despite that, the book should have been way shorter. Take a star off. There. I feel better already.Having gotten that out of the way, the Hook model described in the book is very useful. Hooking a user has four elements: 1. Trigger: What is the itch that the user needs to scratch2. Action: What is she going to do next?3. Variable reward: What is she going to get for it? Is she satisfied yet wanting more?4. Investment: The more work and time the user invests, the more she will keep coming back to it.There is a lot more in this book about different types of triggers, variable rewards and investments. The book also has some useful nuggets about product testing or habit testing. Above all, the most important part of the book is the sections that ask you to evaluate the products you are building now. That somehow drove home the message far more effectively than anything else in the book. Perhaps that's just my learning style - learn by doing.There are a number of jobs/roles in which I could have used the lessons from this book.

The success state would be reading this book and then seeing patterns emerge every day in the products you use (and applying that knowledge in products you build). At a minimum, the introduction and first few chapters do a fantastic job introducing the \"framework\" for how to think about products. Knowledge isn't very useful without application though -- after reading this book, I recommend trying some habit-forming products to see technique in practice. Some apps that do this particularly well are Lift, codecademy and fitocracy (I find that health/fitness/edtech/behavior change applications make a very conscious effort to put use these techniques for Good)."}, {"userName": "Lydia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8726014-lydia", "userReview": "Absolutely loved this book!

The best understanding comes from your own experience- monitor yourself, your friends/relatives, try to replace habits which are already formed by offline/old school things (\"job to be done\" as Clayton Christensen writes).

Eyal also covers the question of whether hooking people to a product is moral or not. The examples are mainly from consumer products (B2C) as there is higher need to hook people and more ways to do it. Business products (B2B) on the other end, go through a different evaluation and usage scrutiny.
