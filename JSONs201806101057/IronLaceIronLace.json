Old secrets unfold, tragedies and prejudices of the past are revealed, and the destruction of long-held hate and revenge play out across generations. It's a very emotional and intense read.Great storytelling with spot-on historical accuracy wins high marks from me. The author captured the authentic colors, flavors, and essence of the history of southern Louisiana without being cliche. My only minor quibble with the book is that there is not closure at the book's end...there's are obvious loose threads that will be picked up in the sequel, Rising Tide, which I have already added to my kindle. I must find out more about the unforgettable characters in Iron Lace (a reference to the beautiful decorative ironwork on the balconies of southern mansions),"}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2231734-denise", "userReview": "This will be one of those books that I will think about for the next little while. Very different than the books I usually read. She explores the racial tensions set in history over decades. A very deep and intriguing story, full of unexpected plots and twists. I had never given a lot of deep thought to the oppression that black people face daily and throughout history. Even if 3/4 of your grandparents are white, your life will be dominated by the influence of your black genes. There were plenty of examples of how society past (1893 - 1965)totally disrespected people and imposed a two tier society where people of colour were often abused and violated.She tells the story of how a peron can grow by understanding their past and the struggles of the ancestors who came before them. How past decisions have affected the present. How in order to get what you want from the future, you have to come to terms and learn from the past... How revenge and vegence may seem like a good idea at the time, but in the end they will only take away from your future.There are many loose ends in this story that I assume will be tied up in the sequel."}, {"userName": "Janet Pittman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6130111-janet-pittman", "userReview": "Emilie Richards' book reveals several intertwining relationships in this story set in New Orleans from 1893 - 1965. The title, \"Iron Lace\", is ironic since it alludes to a \"strong woman who knew what she wanted\" and built a house with uncommon iron lace. The book's protagonist, Aurore Gerritsen, was anything but a strong woman. It was disturbing to read Aurore's tale that reveals her racial prejudice, abuse tolerance, child abandonment, and leaving behind her one true love. Even the descriptions of Aurore's romantic trysts with this one true love were painful to read and made me think of a really bad \"bodice ripper\". The author somewhat redeemed herself with an especially engaging character, Nicky Valentine, who has a small but important role in this story selected by my book club. I think I will pass on the Gerritsen series sequel, \"Rising Tides\"."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Smith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28304387-elizabeth-smith", "userReview": "A story within a story. Set in New Orleans during the civil rights movement, a young black journalist is hired to write the story of an elderly and aristocratic white woman. Her story begins in the late 1800's during a turbulent hurricane that hit southern Louisiana and progresses to the 1960's. Most interesting is the author's telling of the way in which the lives of whites and blacks were intertwined on a daily basis. But once a line was crossed, they were subject to being ostracized by their respective communities.

I bought this book at a supermarket book sale in New Zealand years and years ago. I remembered disliking the cover but being adequately intrigued by the description. I might have bought it only because of a required minimum purchase, that I don\u2019t remember. But so many years later, I finally picked up this rather lengthy paperback and it has been my bedside \u201clight-read\u201d for some time now. I am frankly impressed because I have not been reading such lengthy fictional works in a while, and definitely the genre and style are not what I would normally go for. But not only did I finish the book at a reasonable pace, but I really enjoyed it despite my extremely low expectations. I was originally hoping to learn a little about Louisiana culture and history, and I think the book delivered quite decently in that respect. Iron Lace has a frame narrative, in which the elderly, upper-class, white Aurore Gerritsen employs black journalist Phillip to write her biography. Her story spans from her father\u2019s generation to her grandchildren\u2019s generation, so a lot is going on across the generations. Racism, discrimination, class inequality, and gender inequality are all explored in Iron Lace and while the helplessness caused by the one-drop rule is keenly felt, I felt like these issues were offered as a subtext or afterthought. I could not tell if the author was trying to sneak some of the actual history and conditions of that period into her book in order to reach readers that might not typically care for such subjects, or if the issues were only there to give the story some weightiness and realism that might somehow justify its writing and telling and avoid the accusation of being frivolous. Iron Lace would fit perfectly in the Romance section of the bookstore, and many times the dialogue and writing reminded me of Korean dramas, which often shared a similar premise of lovers being torn apart by society\u2019s cruel standards and values, and family drama, revenge, and class struggle converge and end in catastrophe, tears, and miscommunication with consequences affecting multiple generations. And these dramatic flourishes can be entertaining for many, even if they also result in the predictability of the story. There is nothing surprising about what happens in Iron Lace. In fact, my biggest surprise (although I should have seen it coming) was the fact that this book has a sequel. Why did I not guess that a book I refer to as a New Orleans \u201cKorean drama\u201d would share its serial quality? I am interested in the sequel, and this book does end on a bit of a cliffhanger, because a third of Aurore\u2019s story is missing. I have my guesses about what comes next, and maybe my interest in reading the sequel is based off a desire to confirm my deductions. And maybe that\u2019s the appeal of soap operas and Korean dramas - the impression that there is a predictability to life and some sort of basic template and master narrative that we can keep applying to people and their relationships, the appeal of having the same story retold to us with only the slightest changes."}, {"userName": "Dawn Byers", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4802216-dawn-byers", "userReview": "I so enjoyed this book and yet at times my heart broke.Aurore comes from a wealthy family whose father also has a mistress.

I absolutely HATE it when I'm the only one getting a whiff of the fertilizer when everyone else is sniffing roses. Sorry to be a party-pooper, folks, but I must pronounce this one a \"stinker.\" Set in New Orleans during a 70-plus-year period (1893-1965), \"Iron Lace\" is the story of how racial prejudice wreaked havoc upon the \"love affair\" (and I use the term loosely) of white, privileged (weakling) Aurore Le Danois and bi-racial, orphaned (vengeful bastard) Raphael/Rafe Cantrelle/Etienne Terrebonne. The story is supposed to be a narrative dictated by Aurore in 1965 to a young, black journalist, whose job is to record Aurore's tale as a private, family memoir for a princely sum of $5,000. (That would be the equivalent of $370,000 and change in 2013. A bit excessive, no?) But what could have been an intriguing plot-line is polluted with contrived coincidences and unlikable (bordering on repulsive) characters whose lives are trashed by the consequences of their own poor decisions. SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!A few things that set my teeth on edge:(1) Transposing Millennial (A)Morality onto 1960's culture. Having babies out of wedlock ain't no thing for Marcelite in 1893 or Belinda in 1965. REALLY?(2) Arrrggh, matey! Juan Rodriguez's buried treasure.(3) Using multiple names for characters in a weak attempt to hide their identity. Raphael becomes Etienne who becomes Rafe. Clarissa becomes Nicolette who becomes Nicky. Whoremonger Henri becomes Henry Gerritsen.(4) Very little time is invested in describing how Aurore fell in love with Etienne (under false pretenses, no less!) and became pregnant by him -- but we are expected to believe that their feelings continued throughout their lives.(5) Aurore is more horrified by the fact that Rafe is bi-racial than the fact that he ruined her, contributed to the death of her father, and raised their daughter in a whorehouse. Whaaaaat?On the plus-side -- \"Iron Lace\" is a quick read, and I can now attend my Book Club meeting with a clear conscience. ;)Need I say, I will NOT be reading \"Rising Tides?\"Recommendations: If you're looking for an intriguing trilogy about the affects of slavery on generations of a Southern family, try the \"Beulah Land\" saga by Lonnie Coleman (1973, 77, 80)."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21590993-karen", "userReview": "Good, easy read.

I almost didnt because I thought Ms Richards was a romance writer and I'm not very keen on romances. But it would be a mistake to dismiss Ms Richards as a romance writer in the context of these two books because they are more than that. I always enjoy family sagas that span several generations so that was a hook for me. The characters are robust, realistic and their relationships are interesting and complicated. *spoiler* For a \"romance novel\" it's refreshing to see how few of the romances are successful or even romantic. But I think my favorite element was life on the Gulf, which was well told - including the weather, especially the heat and humidity, which was a character in its own right, as it should be for anyone who's lived in such a climate!

Phillip Benedict is more interested in covering the burgeoning civil rights movement but finds himself unable to refuse Aurore Gerritson. Hers is a story of love and hatred, revenge and betrayal, Creole and Cajun and above all black and white. Anchored by desperate acts during the hurricane of 1893 but rooted in the color bar, Aurore's story forces Phillip to question his own life and beliefs, and especially his relationship with Belinda Beauclaire. With her he discovers New Orleans' vibrant black culture, steaming like rich gumbo beneath the city's white veneer.

It was a very interesting read, especially being in New Orleans."}], "description": "Iron Lace by Emilie Richards released on Apr 19, 2005 is available now for purchase.", "title": "Iron Lace\n      \n          (Iron Lace #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/230812.Iron_Lace", "average": 4.18, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389933228l/230812.jpg", "reviews": 122, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/79044.Emilie_Richards", "name": "Emilie Richards"}], "type": ["Romance", "Historical", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/230812.Iron_Lace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7983377-iron-lace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7179728-iron-lace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10619478-iron-lace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/230800.Wedding_Ring", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27067674-when-we-were-sisters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6349540-happiness-key", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220059.Lover_s_Knot", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2940086-sister-s-choice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26813208-thirty-five-and-a-half-conspiracies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489452-thirty-one-and-a-half-regrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20687181-thirty-two-and-a-half-complications", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198652-twenty-eight-and-a-half-wishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15836745-twenty-nine-and-a-half-reasons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29339972-thirty-six-and-a-half-motives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23263614-thirty-three-and-a-half-shenanigans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40199170-thirty-and-a-half-excuses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments"]}
