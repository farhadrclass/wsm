She justifies her freakish interest in the unusual birth and in the deaths of both mother and baby by mentioning that she and the woman were related --\"sixth or seventh cousin[s] by marriage\"(175). Later in that conversation, which can more aptly be described as \"parallel talking,\" Mrs. Pritchard delivers one of the many priceless lines that spring from the mouths of O'Connor's characters: \"I know if I was in an iron lung there would be some things I wouldn't do\"(178).Mrs. Pritchard is no Paige Dunn. For Elizabeth Berg's Paige Dunn,who --in the ninth month of pregnancy -- was stricken by polio, there is no \"if\"; and there are no limits other than those imposed by a body that cannot move below the neck. She was supposed to die. She didn't. Diana, the daughter born to this woman in an iron lung, was supposed to die. She didn't. They're alive -- what then? Abandoned by her husband, Paige was told what ordinary people figured she was supposed to do -- allow her daughter to be adopted (as Paige herself had been). She didn't. Dismiss We Are All Welcome Here as \"chick lit\" -- your loss. Label it a fairy tale or a parable. I wouldn't. It's fascinating, unsettling, uplifting, and more. It's not \"The Little Engine That Could\" or \"Jack and the Beanstalk.\" It's powerful fiction that was inspired by the lives of the two women to whom the work is dedicated. The most important characters are courageous and vulnerable -- heroes with flaws that I certainly couldn't ignore. Their experiences confirm the truth that we are NOT all welcome here -- still. Most of the novel is set in the early 1960s, and anti-discrimination laws have obviously not yet created a \"welcoming here\" for those who are \"different.\"Lately, it seems as if books that I should read keep finding me at just the right time. As I struggle to deal with what I regret about my part in relationships with important people who have left this world, I happened to take We Are All Welcome Here off of my to-read shelf. Upon reaching the end of the novel [NO SPOILER AHEAD], I felt that there was nothing accidental in my having chosen to read this work, this month, this year. Surely I am only one of many thousands who have wept or will weep after they read / hear the final words of Berg's daughter-narrator because they, too, fervently hope(d) that somehow they will someday have the chance to tell their dead mothers: \"You were right -- much more often than I knew.\" Five stars for We Are All Welcome Here. I'll forget giving too many stars. I'll regret giving too few."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "It\u2019s so delightful, revisiting a book and discovering you enjoyed it just as much as you did the first time around \u2013 if not more so. This was certainly the case with Elizabeth Berg\u2019s novel: \u201cWe Are All Welcome Here,\u201d an endearing story of triumph over tragedy, love in the face of adversity, faith, perseverance, and learning to accept each other\u2019s differences with grace. \u201cLove does not have legs . . . It does not have arms. But it moves mountains.\u201dWith captivating awe I was once again transported back to 1964 Tupelo, Mississippi, into the lives of hormone-contrary fourteen-year-old Diana Dunn \u2013 who is a hoot, her polio stricken mother, Paige \u2013 who I admire beyond words, and Paige\u2019s tough-as-nails caregiver, Peacie \u2013 who has a heart of gold behind the nails. But Diana\u2019s hormones aren't the only warring factors at play. Prejudice comes in all shapes, colors, genders, and forms. From the color of one\u2019s skin, to physical disabilities, to the balance in one\u2019s bank account, to one\u2019s parenting skills, to\u2026..you name it, there\u2019s always going to be someone with something negative to say. \u201cYou\u2019re going to run into situations where you have to decide whether or not to take a stand. Sometimes it just isn't worth it. But other times it is. Not only is it worth it, it\u2019s vital. It makes you the person that you are. You have to honor what you know is true, or bit by bit, you die inside.\u201dTruisms, humor, character idiosyncrasies, nuggets of wisdom, and atmosphere lifted off the page in new and insightful ways that gave this simplistic yet profound story (Berg\u2019s signature writing style) even deeper meaning this go around. \u201cOnce you have shelter from the elements and clothes to wear and food to eat it\u2019s all just one-upmanship, that\u2019s all \u2013 status and game-playing. Whose house is bigger? Whose clothes are nicer? Whose car is shiniest? What difference does it make, really?\u201dMore than just a book club selection for the month, this slim novel made me think about all the wonderful blessings in my life - despite RSD/CRPS limitations and challenges; limitations I wasn't saddled with when I first read this book, years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re all trapped in a body with limitations, even the most able-bodied among us. And we\u2019re all guided by minds with limitations of their own . . . Our job regardless of our bodily circumstances, is to rise above what holds us down, and to help others do the same!\u201dCertainly, \u201cWe Are All Welcome Here\u201d isn't the most literary of books. A couple support characters could have been more fully developed. The Elvis scene was too abrupt. And there were a couple scenes that irked me a bit. But any book that captivates, entertains, educates and breathes fresh life and wisdom into readers deserves noteworthy praise \u2013 FOUR STARS."}, {"userName": "Carole", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630646-carole", "userReview": "I haven't read an Elizabeth Berg book in a very long time.

This is not chick-lit, it is more like relationship fiction. Her prose is so descriptive, warm and encompassing yet simple and true. I feel drawn into each character, their feelings, experiences and their relationships. Yet it is not dramatic over the top stuff. The characters are ordinary yet extraordinary. I have read virtually all her novels but somehow missed this one. She was my favorite author for a long time. I would say up until about 2011, all her novels are exceptional. After that something is lacking for me unfortunately. I can not really compare her to any other author in terms of style - to me she is very unique. This story does have a bit of the feel of The Help - it touches on the civil rights issues of that era.In this particular novel we have a young narrator again (about 13) as in the Katie Nash series. Berg is very adept at the coming of age perspective. The story also revolves around disability and the challenges of the caregivers. The story is sweet, touching, funny and heartwarming/wrenching."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20249375-beth", "userReview": "I've read many of Elizabeth's Berg's books but this is truly one of her best. Such a beautiful story of a teenaged girl and her Mother who is paralyzed from the neck down from polio. Set in Tupelo Miss in 1964 EB weaves the struggles of that time into the novel effortlessly.Based on the real life story of a fan who wrote to EB, she took that story and wrote a remarkable fictionalized account of the lives of Pat and Marianne Raming.Loved every word of it and you will too."}, {"userName": "Rosina Lippi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3139413-rosina-lippi", "userReview": "Domestic drama like this can easily sink into the melodramatic abyss. You've got a quadriplegic woman struggling to keep afloat financially; her husband left her when she came down with polio -- at nine months pregnant -- and the only help he offered was to get the baby adopted. A real peach of a guy.The daughter (Diana) narrates. She's thirteen at as the novel opens, so this is a coming of age story. Her relationship with her mother, with Peacie, the black woman who has cared for them both since Diana's birth, and Peacie's husband; with her best friend. It's about the way poverty grinds people down and down. It's about the sixties, segregation, voting rights, racism. It's about Elvis Presley.Berg is juggling a great deal, but mostly she pulls it off. The last chapter wobbles precariously, because Berg wants to leave these characters in a good place, but a lot of very bad things have happened. So there's a bit of magic there, of the authorial kind. I can't say more without giving too much away, but I can say this: I was very moved by the last few scenes, though the whole time I was also aware of the heavy handed nature of the resolution. It still worked for me on some (sentimental) level.There's nothing wrong with sentiment, with emotion, with happy endings. I'm just not sure about the way Berg produced them, in this instance."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "I listened to the audio book of this one a couple of years ago, which I highly recommend.

She delivers her third child while in an iron lung, in which she remains for 3 years. Her husband divorces her and offers to have the children adopted out, which she refuses to allow. She eventually is able to raise her children and earn a college degree, with help from caregivers.In the novel the main character is an only child, a 13 year old girl, who lives in the deep south in 1964 with her mother, a victim of polio who can only move her head. The mother's main caregiver is a black woman, and through her and her boyfriend's story, we learn about some of the civil rights issues of the time. The circumstances of the fictional mother's situation are quite similar to that of the real person, but the southern location, the racial issues which affect the story, and the appearance of Elvis were added. Some of the characters were pretty well developed and it's quite a tear jerker at the end. However, knowing that there was a real person who raised her children while maintaining an overwhelmingly positive outlook about her situation made me wish that Berg had written about her instead of making up so much of the story."}, {"userName": "Stacey", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/320154-stacey", "userReview": "If she doesn't already, Elizabeth Berg should write movies for Lifetime (Television for Idiots). Her other two books I read/listened to starred a divorced woman and a widowed woman. This one stars a woman with polio who can only move her head. I moved mine to roll my eyes and sigh a lot. Oh, brother, is this schmaltzy. It's narrated by her pre-teen daughter who she's raising in the 1950's with the help of (of course) a Sassy Black Lady, the ultimate insulting stereotype. Also, if you know your Greek drama terms, there is a real doozy of a deus ex machina in the end that made me laugh out loud. Two words, and that's all I'll say: Elvis Presley. Well, here's one more word: dumb.Still, just like a Lifetime movie, there is a certain entertainment value, and you don't really have to think too hard, which is occasionally nice.

Elizabeth Berg is always good for a nice, sweet story, one that is light but doesn't insult your intelligence. (Ditto Ann Tyler. They may, in fact, be the same person.) This book, based on a true story suggested to Berg by a reader, is about a woman who contracts polio while pregnant in the early 1950s, then gives birth to her baby in an iron lung. Her husband leaves her and offers to put the baby up for adoption before he leaves, but the mom will have nothing to do with it. She manages to raise the baby with the aid of a no-nonsense caretaker. The majority of the story takes place when the child is 13, and is set against the backdrop of the 1960s South. So, naturally the issue of racial tensions enters heavily into the plot. Although this was no The Help, I liked this book. I always enjoy historical fiction, because even if the plot isn't interesting (and this one was a little bit slow), you learn a lot about the time period in which the book is set."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12895867-robin", "userReview": "This is maybe my fifth or sixth Elizabeth Berg novel and, despite the fact that it was missing a characteristically laugh-out-loud moment that I've come to look forward to in Berg's work, this might just be my favorite.I loved the point of view of the 13 year old, whom I so identified with. I cringe to think of my narcissistic, naive, 13 year old self and I believe Berg captured this painfully unaware stage of life really well. I enjoyed watching the drama of her mother's \"romance\" unfold from Diana's perspective. You get that Diana doesn't fully understand what's happening, but you as the reader, do. Same with the friendship between her mother and Peacie. You get why Diana hates her (if you remember being a teenager) but as an adult, you also get why her mother loves and trusts her. I found myself thinking about this novel a lot after I finished it...the injustice of random life-altering sickness, the ways the world had changed since the 60's to accomodate disabilities or at least to make life more bearable, the awfulness of depending on others 100% of the time, the strength of the real woman upon whom this novel is based, and the power of mind over body."}, {"userName": "Terri Jacobson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8370501-terri-jacobson", "userReview": "Paige Dunn contracted polio during her last month of pregnancy, and now is trying to raise her daughter as a single mother in 1964 Tupelo, Mississippi.

Berg does a fine job of narrating from the perspective of Diana, the daughter, capturing all of her innocence, outrage, selfishness and selflessness perfectly. The setting, a segregated Mississippi, provides some weight as the primary caregiver is a black nurse named Peacie. What I found intriguing is that a reader wrote to Berg to request that she (Berg) tell her mother's story. Initially intending to say no, Berg was captivated by the enclosed photo and agreed to write a fictional story about the woman and her mother, using some details provided by the letter-writer. The book opens with a letter from Berg, explaining the request, her reaction, and why she finally chose to write something at all. I liked some of the situations Berg threw her characters into: Diana and her friend Suralee putting on plays for the adults in town; the \"relationships\" that Diana's mother had with Brooks and Dell; Peacie struggling between wanting to help keep Diana innocent and wanting her to understand the reality of the situation and truly, how lucky Diana and her mother are to have her working for them; LaRue and his pride in reading, writing and standing up for the freedom of \"his people\"; the neighbor being on stand-by \"for emergencies only\"; the social worker and her relationship to the situation; Paige's attitude toward poverty, making the best of an awful situation, her observations of other people, and her understanding of the racial attitudes of Mississippi during that time.There are scenes that will make you feel a bit uncomfortable, but overall Berg lends a great deal of reality, of gravitas, to a very unusual situation marked by an extraordinary character -- this woman with polio who lived in an iron lung for three years. I'd be curious to read a companion biography on the real woman that this book was based on.The only thing that I wasn't sure about was the inclusion of Elvis in the story. That one point alone definitely put this into the realm of fiction for me, bringing about an almost fairy tale aspect to it. (To clarify, the inclusion of Elvis as a character didn't ruin the book for me, it just ruined my suspension of disbelief and reminded me that these characters didn't exist as written.)"}, {"userName": "Havebooks Willread", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27589594-havebooks-willread", "userReview": "Oh, we have to love us some Elizabeth Berg!

Berg takes the idea of a woman being paralyzed by polio, abandoned by her husband, and raising her daughter alone and makes it a study of the human will to not just survive, but overcome and thrive. I was captivated by Paige's attitude after surviving polio:\"Anyway, what I believe is that what happened to me, revealed me. . .it made me know how I really feel about important things. I mean, whatever the diagnosis is, isn't the issue. The issue is the way the person who has it looks at it. Understand? I know that polio made me be my best self. It's funny, it seems like people need obstacles to bring out their finest qualities\" (143).Diana, the daughter who grows up taking care of her mother as her mother teaches her about life, learns many lessons in this \"coming of age\" story. Interestingly, the story is set during the Civil Rights movement and Diana comes to realize that her Black caregiver and other Black people are also limited by their circumstances.\"We're all trapped,' my mother said.

Challenged by the effects of the polio she contracted during her last month of pregnancy, Paige is nonetheless determined to live as normal a life as possible and to raise her daughter, Diana, in the way she sees fit-with the support of her tough-talking black caregiver, Peacie.Diana is trying in her own fashion to live a normal life.

The story of Diana Dunn growing up in Tupelo at that time, dreaming of Elvis, taking care of her mom with the help of their maid Peacie, and trying to understand why blacks and whites were treated differently, trying to understand the WORLD, was a thoroughly entertaining one.

I decided several times I wasn't going to finish it, but applying a few little stratagems kept me connected to the people until the end."}, {"userName": "willaful", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2833071-willaful", "userReview": "This is a wonderful reading. The long stretch at the beginning in which it's just the narrator speaking gets a little monotonous, but after other characters come in, it kept my interest completely. I was intrigued at the end to discover that it was an author reading, because the many different voices -- different ages, sexes, accents -- were so perfectly realized.It's also a really good story. I agree with other reviewers that, plotwise, it's a bit heavy on the deus ex machina. But that seems like a small thing next to the rich complexity of the relationships, the vividness of the detail, the insights into mother/daughter relationships, the empathetic depictions of life with a serious disability and of loving someone with a serious disability.By the way, I was wondering all through the story when the title would be explained, and it never was. I felt like an idiot, because it was so obvious when I stopped to think about it. We are all welcome here... everyone, no matter what their disability, has something to offer the world."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1887921-jennifer", "userReview": "I was first introduced to Elizabeth Berg as an author by a friend who gave me a book she loved, Joy School, as a gift. It was a really good read that opened my eyes to a new author (for me at least). So recently I had the opportunity to read another of Berg\u2019s books, We Are All Welcome Here. It is just as well written and told. It is hard to imagine Diana Dunn\u2019s (the narrator) life as she is bound to care for her mother who was rendered a quadriplegic by Polio when she was 22, just before Diana was born. The novel is set in Tupelo, Mississippi against the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement. Diana is not only forced to understand her relationship with her mother but to consider society as a whole, long before most thirteen year olds are ready to broaden their world view. It is a touching story that illustrates compassion for others and is a good, enjoyable read!"}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2553419-victoria", "userReview": "This is a re-read. No matter how much I love a book, I rarely re-read it. (Probably should re-read more. Typical of my \"style,\" I can scarcely recall the details of a novel's plot but I carry the impression it left on me, good or bad, forever.) I've wanted my Book Club to read Elizabeth Berg for some time now; choosing which one was difficult, but because of who we are and what this book is and how it flows in with other books we've recently read, I felt now was the time to read We Are All Welcome Here. I hope at the November meeting the others will have had as pleasant a time with this book as I did. If anyone from Book Club or anyone reading this review appreciates Elizabeth Berg, I recommend following her on Facebook. Her posts are like chapters in an ongoing book. Plus recipes! And dog pictures!"}, {"userName": "chucklesthescot", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426724-chucklesthescot", "userReview": "14 year old Diana is used to doing her share of looking after her mother Paige, who has been left badly disabled by polio,with help only from Peacie,the daytime caregiver who Diana has a strained relationship with. Diana and her friend both have dreams of fame and a better life,so when a handsome man moves into the town,both girls want him to date their single mothers. This rivalry leads to a terrible change in the lives of Paige,Diana and Peacie. This book couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to be-a bit of civil rights activism, a bit of the 'against all odd' medical drama, a coming of age drama and an implausible feel-good story...and it came up lacking on all fronts. I liked the civil rights part and Paige's challenges and doomed romance but the other parts with the girls doing the plays, and the Elvis sub plot just didn't work and turned the book into a bit of a mish-mash."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104823-kate", "userReview": "Diana is growing up in the 1960s, being raised in a most unconventional manner by her mother Paige, who contracted polio while she was pregnant and is paralyzed from the neck down. Diana is also being raised by Peacie, her mother's black caregiver. As Diana comes of age in a sleepy Southern town, she learns just how awesome her mother and Peacie both are.No matter what the premise of the novel is, anything by Elizabeth Berg is wonderful to read. I wasn't totally excited about this premise, although I did enjoy reading the preface, which tells of how a reader asked Berg to write this story based on her own mother. This was a coming of age story much like Joy School, one my favorites by this author. I really liked how the ending came together."}], "description": "Elizabeth Berg, bestselling author of The Art of Mending and The Year of Pleasures, has a rare talent for revealing her characters' hearts and minds in a manner that makes us empathize completely. Her new novel, We Are All Welcome Here, features three women, each struggling against overwhelming odds for her own kind of freedom.It is the summer of 1964. In Tupelo, Mississippi, the town of Elvis's birth, tensions are mounting over civil-rights demonstrations occurring ever more frequently-and violently-across the state. But in Paige Dunn's small, ramshackle house, there are more immediate concerns. Challenged by the effects of the polio she contracted during her last month of pregnancy, Paige is nonetheless determined to live as normal a life as possible and to raise her daughter, Diana, in the way she sees fit-with the support of her tough-talking black caregiver, Peacie.Diana is trying in her own fashion to live a normal life. As a fourteen-year-old, she wants to make money for clothes and magazines, to slough off the authority of her mother and Peacie, to figure out the puzzle that is boys, and to escape the oppressiveness she sees everywhere in her small town. What she can never escape, however, is the way her life is markedly different from others'. Nor can she escape her ongoing responsibility to assist in caring for her mother. Paige Dunn is attractive, charming, intelligent, and lively, but her needs are great-and relentless. As the summer unfolds, hate and adversity will visit this modest home. Despite the difficulties thrust upon them, each of the women will find her own path to independence, understanding, and peace. And Diana's mother, so mightily compromised, willend up giving her daughter an extraordinary gift few parents could match.", "title": "We Are All Welcome Here", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237231.We_Are_All_Welcome_Here", "average": 3.83, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388291575l/237231.jpg", "reviews": 836, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3529.Elizabeth_Berg", "name": "Elizabeth Berg"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Womens Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/237231.We_Are_All_Welcome_Here", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2078361.We_Are_All_Welcome_Here", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6661706-we-are-all-welcome-here", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127388.We_Are_All_Welcome_Here", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3014502-we-are-all-welcome-here", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5190.Open_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226858.What_We_Keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127395.The_Year_of_Pleasures", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127390.Talk_Before_Sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32918898-the-story-of-arthur-truluv", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
