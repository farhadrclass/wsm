Trust me. I am from Costa Rica and I live precisely in San Jos\u00e9 and we don't have a dang beach around.I am sure that Spielberg wouldn't do that kind of mistake if he'd need to portrait Paris, France, but a dang capital city in a third world country? Who cares?Well, I care, I am from that precise third world country. When you would have your capital cities portraited in a wrong stereotypical way, you will understand me. (And don't get me wrong. I love the movie and I am fan of Spielberg's work, just pointing out my feeling about that scene that even in the book happens in another different place).I love the book, since the author, Michael Crichton, lived a lot of time in my country, Costa Rica, and he fell in love so much with our culture and geography that he wanted to use it as background for one of his novels.The novel became his most famous book. In the book, you can realize how well Crichton indeed knew about our places using specific real places like the Cabo Blanco Biologic Reserve and the Puntarenas' Hospital Monse\u00f1or Sanabria. You don't came out with places like that with your quick internet search. You need to live here to know things like that. Of course, Nublar Island is a made up place but hey, no problem there, it's like Gotham City or Metropolis, always there are space for another fictional island in literature.I was lucky to get my paperback copy of Jurassic Park just when the movie was on its hype 20 years ago, since thanks to that it has the logo of the film (see? I don't hate the movie, just questioned that dang scene).I love my edition of the book since never they published ever again the book with that cover, so it's one my priceless posessions in my library.\nAn insanely popular sci-fi novel with dinosaurs set on my country? Oh, yes! I had to love that book!"}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "Rereading for obvious reasons. :D :D :D :D"}, {"userName": "Miranda Reads", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71848701-miranda-reads", "userReview": "\u201cLife breaks free. Life expands to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds a way.\u201d \n\n Jurassic Park has all the major problems of a theme park, a zoo...and genetically altered prehistoric animals. That's right - the dinosaurs are back from the dead and nothing - I repeat nothing - could go wrong...right?\nHa. \nAs my favorite character, Ian Malcom would say, \nAll major changes are like death. You can't see to the other side until you are there.\n Though, considering some of the problems they had with the park, I strongly believe that several of issues could've been predicted...that is, if Mr. Hammond and his scientists would've taken the time to thoroughly consider implications and consequences  of bringing back extinct species. Dr. Allen Grant, Ellie, Ian Malcom and a host of other professionals (along with Mr. Hammond's grandchildren) are invited to the island to give their expert opinion  on this un-extinction.Of course, this visit comes at an excellent time - there is a huge storm rolling in, the raptors are getting restless and there's some evidence that the smaller dinos have made it off the island. \nPerrrfect\nBut don't mention any of this to Mr. Hammond or his staff - they won't listen to any negativity.. As Ian Malcom said,\n\u201cThey don't have intelligence. They have what I call 'thintelligence.' They see the immediate situation. They think narrowly and they call it 'being focused.' They don't see the surround. They don't see the consequences.\u201d\nPredictably, the storm rolls in, things go very, very wrong...and soon even Mr. Hammond might have to admit that there may be an issue or two in his precious park. \n\u201cYou know, at times like this one feels, well, perhaps extinct animals should be left extinct.\u201d \nIf I had to pick a single, defining movie from my childhood...this would be it. So, of course, I had to pick up the book to see how it compared. It definitely delivered.In this novel, Mr. Hammond wasn't quite the bumbling, grandfatherly figure he is in the movie. And of his grandchildren, Lex is certainly younger than her movie-version (and young-Lex was more than a little annoying). This is one of those rare cases where the movie is not being a true-to-book adaption, but they are both equally entertaining and delightful. Highly recommended!And just like when I was a kid, I am comforted that if this dinosaur apocalypse ever happens, things would play out like this: \n\u201cGod created dinosaurs. God destroyed dinosaurs. God created Man. Man destroyed God. Man created dinosaurs.\"\"Dinosaurs eat man...Woman inherits the earth.\u201d \nAudiobook CommentsThe reader (Scott Brick) was alright. It's just...this book is about DINOSAURS - surely this reader could've mustered some enthusiasm??"}, {"userName": "Sr3yas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23097409-sr3yas", "userReview": "\u275d Discovery, they believe, is inevitable.

I think I was seven years old and my favorite pastimes were collecting gravel, screaming and making my sister's life hell. Watching movie was not one of them. And that movie changed it all. And no, It wasn't Citizen Kane. It was the legendary Jurassic Park! But it took me almost fifteen years to pick up the original novel. (I am still not sure why it took me so long) And surprisingly, it was not what I expected.\nStory\nWhen advanced genetic engineering breaks the very basic laws of nature by creating an extinct life form, billionaire John Hammond decides to turn that discovery into the best damn attraction the world has ever witnessed: A Dinosaur park! But the investors of this ambitious project gets spooked because of some recent events and seeks a second opinion. They invite Paleontologist, Alan Grant, paleobotanist graduate student, Ellie Sattler, famous mathematician and chaos theorist, Ian Malcolm, and a lawyer representing the investors, Donald Gennaro for a guided tour of the park. The unique voice in this story belongs to Ian Malcolm who spends most of the time warning others about the park.So everyone went ahead with the tour and...Well, let's just say things didn't go as planned.\nHey, I've watched the movie gazillion times! I don't have to read this book.\nStop right there. The book is so very different from the movie. The movie is a visual spectacular that tells an adventurous science fiction story. While watching the movie, you will be shouting \" yay, Dinosaurs\". The novel (almost) paints the same story, but its focus is on something else entirely: The science. The very idea of creating life out of nothing, the dangers of unchecked development and the proof that you can not control the uncontrollable. Also, there is a healthy dose of chaos theory, Dragon curves, Dinosaur's evolution and survival! Throughout the story, you'll be likeOverall, Jurassic Park is one helluva a ride.

I blast through it once every few years, throw it on my shelf and the distance slowly makes me derisive, and then something forces me to pick it up again when my brain needs a little peanut butter and jelly dipped in hot chocolate, and I am forced to admit that Jurassic Park is a damn fine novel. Sure it's packed with Michael Crichton's usual band of screenplay-adaptation-friendly archetypes, sure it derives much of its plot and thought from Arthur Conan Doyle, HG Wells and Mary Shelley, sure it's pulpy and quick to read, but those things aren't necessarily bad, and Crichton does enough to elevate or alter these elements to make Jurassic Park a fine piece of popular Sci-Fi in its own right. Yes, the characters are there to serve the plot. Each has an important skill or skill-set -- Muldoon is the \"Great White Hunter,\" Malcolm is the chaos theoretician, Grant and Saddler are the paleontologists, Tim and Lex are the kids in peril, etc., etc. -- and who they are and the how their stories unfold are easily altered or even cut entirely in the shift from book to screen because they are less important than their skills, yet Crichton still manages to make them likable enough that we care about what happens to them. None of the characters are dynamic or round, but their static flatness makes them no less interesting than a character like Ian Fleming's James Bond. They may not be as memorable as Bond (although Ian Malcolm has some pretty impressive popularity for a supporting character), but they don't really have to be. We can forget them after the book is over, then enjoy them anew when we go back to the book later. They aren't Hamlet, but they work.And yes Crichton borrows liberally, but he borrows from the stars. He uses Shelley's classic creation-gone-mad trope, and he blatantly thieves from Doyle's Lost World and Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau, but he does it with style. Granted it's a pulpy style, but that pulpiness is an asset. It takes those pieces he's combined and lets the reader catch mere glimpses of them outside the roller coaster car as he takes us into drops and curves and spins and loop-de-loops. The speed and pace nearly makes us forget from whom he's borrowing. And that is by design. Crichton's pulpiness is pacing, conscious pacing, and as literary action-oriented plotters go, Crichton is a master of speedy obfuscation.Add to all that some memorable tirades about science and reason and the environment, some kick ass Velociraptors and T-rexes, an excellent scene with toxic eggs, and some rather insightful criticism of \"great men,\" and Jurassic Park is a book that I predict will stand the test of time. We may not see its future today, but fifty to a hundred years from now it will be taught in schools and remembered, while other, more literary books will be forgotten. later --  It just struck me that if I forget the quality of this book between readings, and I do, then my prophecy concerning Jurassic Park's staying power is probably flawed. I think I may be more Nostradumbass than Nostradamus."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "[\n\n(hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Luffy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407364-luffy", "userReview": "So, straight to it. Jurassic Park, the book, is inimitable, apart from a few clumsy attempts. One thing that differentiated it from its wannabes is that, unlike books about sharks, snakes or let's say, zombies, dinosaurs come in very varied shapes. This means that the way the casualties meet their end is just as variable. Michael Crichton props up his last act with inspired flair and experienced cunning. He knows that the action in this book will go only so far, just like last acts in an all out comedy movie WILL be lame, unless something rash and daring is undertook. The soliloquy (for us) of Ian Malcolm are just like the morphine that the doctor prescribed for him. Malcolm's rants about science are dishonest but it's all in good jest. The verisimilitude of Isla Nublar is out of this world. The landscape, the computers, the dinosaurs, the genetic restraints that shackles the dinosaurs, and lastly, the human protagonists in the book, are so well imagined, arranged spatially, manipulated to create tension and pacing, that I recognize the hand of a master entertainer at work. Spielberg, eat your heart out. The ultimate slap in the face of conventional science fiction is the fact, that Jurassic Park takes place in our timeline. How gutsier can you get? The book is now half forgotten, but that will change when the next wave of genetic manipulation arrives. Jurassic Park can have quite a few interpretations that pertain to civics, science, philosophy, and of course maths' sexy cousin, Chaos Theory!

It wasn't the multiple viewpoints or so-so prose, it was the science. I worked for awhile as an assistant paleontologist--field, prep, and curating--and I promise you, pretty much everything in the first 50 pages on this topic is wrong. I wasn't loving the book anyway, and kept finding random factual errors (passports not needed for international travel? You can't possibly fake a fax of a x-ray?) But the scenes on the fossil \"dig\" did me in.1) you don't clean fossils in the field. You get them out of the field and into the lab, where you have air scribes, microscopes, safe places to rest them, and far more tools than you can schlep on your back out to the field.2) \"bits of bone flaked away as he dug.\" Then he's an incompetent idiot. You do everything to keep \"bits\" from flaking away. A bit IS the fossil. If this happens in the lab, you stop, stabilize, get a better prep person if you have a real star at it in your group, or you just quit. Plenty of fossils remain only partially exposed in museums trays because they are too friable to clean further. They're still useful. Just because it isn't on public display to wow the kiddies doesn't mean it isn't there. This Alan guy, he just keeps ruining the fossil. When real paleontologists flake a tiny little something away, they beat their breasts and curse and sometimes even cry.3) They have the only egg site in the world for this species, and they're using jackhammers on it. Seriously? Jackhammers? We didn't own one. We wouldn't have taken one if it were a gift. You preserve the data at all costs, including leaving it the heck alone, if need be. Jackhammers may be rarely used with huge, whole specimens, if your team can drag a generator that far, but not in this case--never ever would that happen. 4) The broken bones get tossed aside and whirred up into fragments... No. Broken bones are also useful. Very useful. Broken bones get collected, cleaned, and curated. Museum collections are mostly of fossils that are partial. The only fossils I ever saw thrown away were some that got lost from their documentation and were therefore useless.5) ...from which DNA is extracted. Not even in a million-year-old fossil, much less a 190-million-year-old one. When you crunch up fossils into sandy bits, all you get is sand.6) rubber cement. Very big for stabilizing in 1903. Not so much when this book was written. A plastic resin dissolved in acetone is used, like polyvinyl butryal. ... and so on.You simply cannot make that many factual errors and I continue reading. My suspension of disbelief is gone long before the monsters come on stage. This is the third of his books I've tried, the second I've given up on before the end, and all three were just riddled with errors.

I guess I've always had my reservations because of what an impact the movie had on me as a kid. I was about 9 or 10 when the movie first came out and it blew my mind. As the book likes to point out, boys love dinosaurs and that was true.As a side note, I'm loving how much my son (5 y.o.) loves dinosaurs. He knows so much more about them than I do, in fact his favorite is the Giganotosaurus, a dinosaur I learned existed from him.(the hipster's T-Rex)Now, I'll be the first to admit my memory of of the movie is a tad hazy, but from what I do remember, the movie actually follows the book quite a bit, at least up until about 2/3 of the book where either my memory is bad or the books is completely different (oh and Grant loves kids in the book, which is ... opposite). More than I would have guessed, which was not a lot. There's a little more detail to the initial attacks we see in the movie and it's not quite as gruesome in parts (and much more gruesome in others). The girl gets attacked by the Compsognathus (little green dinos), or **\"compys\" as they're known. **excuse my spelling, I listened to the audio and like Fox news, I don't feel the need to fact check.The park is just about ready to open and it's time to get all the consultants together to make sure it's on the right track. Thus, Grant and Sattler, Ian Malcolm, the attorney Jennaro, and a couple others are flown in. Of course, nefarious doings are going on and a competitor wants in on the dinosaur action. In comes Dennis Nedry, who is pretty much spot on copied in the movie. Excellent job Wayne Knight. He's pretty much built the entire IT system for the park and thus has quite a bit of control over pretty much everything. I don't remember his involvement in the park being this extensive, but then again, I was 9. There's a frikkin' T-REX!!!As we all know, everything goes to pot and we all know what goes from here. Even though the movie diverges from the book, we all know what goes on from here.And it's awesome. I had a blast listening to this book and Scott Brick is such a talented narrator, you don't even notice him reading. It's just pure story.A couple *important* things I wanted to point out... some spoilers for the book:1. The lawyer, Jennaro, is not as spineless as in the movie, does not get eaten while he's sitting on the toilet by a T-Rex (okay, that was an awesome addition), and even saves the day at one point by pointing out law that doesn't exist. (No, this sudden support for the lawyer has nothing to do with the fact that I have an Esq. on the end of my name ... perish the thought)2. Was Lex Murphy that annoying in the movie? I really don't remember that. She's super duper annoying in the book.3. Ian Malcolm's Chaos Theory should have been cut down like in the movie. There are a number of times he's going off about it and you're literally thinking, aren't there dinosaurs around the corner about to eat them? Does anyone care about any theory at this time besides the theory of escaping dinosaurs? Still a great character, just weird timing of his rants about corporations and such, which I'm not disagreeing with.(literally the only image you're allowed to use when referring to Ian Malcolm)4. So this book was published in 1990 and this book had maybe a total of 15 to 20 people at risk, not counting the rest of the world that could potentially be at risk by dinosaurs escaping. We're talking people you're honestly worried about dying or not throughout the book. Jump to 2015, Jurassic World, and we've got an entire park open with thousands and thousands of people at risk. Does that say something about how our society's penchant for destruction? 5. But seriously, back to Malcolm, Chaos Theory essentially comes down to - because dinosaurs are an unknown, and much like the weather - unpredictable - you're all screwed and nothing will work right. And then Malcolm gloats. Even while dinosaurs are stalking him. Now, the opposing argument in the book is that zoos exist so why can't dinosaurs be kept in a zoo? My problem is that if everyone gave up because there was an unknown then we'd have just about nothing. People go forward with the unknown all the time. Many fail, but that's how great success comes as well. I guess I'm saying I needed more to this theory and preferably when I can think about the theory and not when DINOSAURS ARE LITERALLY AROUND THE CORNER TRYING TO EAT YOU.6. Jurassic Park gets lots of crap for providing false ideas as to what dinosaurs actually looked like (see raptors). While it's true, if you ignore the story, it is explained. You know that whole science part toward the beginning, well they talk about only finding partial DNA and having to graft in DNA from other animals (which actually becomes a huge problem). This would lend toward dinosaurs that don't actually look like they're supposed to and I'm fine with that explanation. I have to say, after 25 years, Jurassic Park really held up well. Lots of the communication issues would be the same problem nowadays because of the fact that they're on a remote island that cell phones would be problematic on anyway. It helps that a book doesn't have to actually reproduce computer screens so you can picture those as high tech as you want as long as you ignore the amounts of memory they mention. At least they're in the gigabytes still.And most of this I just point out because of how into the book I was. I really had a blast listening to Jurassic Park and I can highly recommend a reading of this classic. One of the few book/movie combinations where I can honestly say I loved both for their own reasons. Now, I need to go track down a copy of that movie.

Jurassic Park has grown beyond Crichton's novel, into a movie, into a theme park attraction, into a thousand types of paraphernalia... In fact, it has become so popular that we forget the original work this concept came from.I saw the movie first. It is a marvel of special effects and unbearably suspenseful. The book is nothing like that.This novel is a serious work of science fiction. As with Crichton's other novels, the research is so detailed and the setting so well wrought that we are sometimes conned into believing that we are reading truth and not fiction. But that does not take away from the excitement the story generates - this is by no means a dull, expository work.But most importantly, it raises important questions about the existential import of man tampering with nature - something which is conspicuous by its absence in the film. Have we grown sufficiently as a species to do it safely?

Can't believe it took me years to finally pick this one up and read it. I watched the movie adaptation when I was a kid, so I can't really remember much of the plot other than dinosaurs gone wild, and I'm sure I remember an elevator scene. Aside from those, I had no idea what was in store for me before I read this. I wasn't hesitant on reading this, but my really long TBR list was the reason why I didn't read this sooner than I should have. All I can say is that I regret not prioritizing this, because this was an amazing novel. I had two reasons why I finally picked this up, and one of them would be that it's a Crichton novel for pete's sake. The mere fact that I kept pushing it back on my TBR list was crazy of me. The other reason would be that I heard they're making a new movie adaptation, so I wanted to freshen up my knowledge of this one.The characters were really likeable, just like the ones from Crichton's other novels. Some may be funny, witty, annoying, or plain old normal. None of the characters were bad, and I don't consider an annoying character to be bad, cause a novel needs an annoying character. My favorite in this one was Tim. Stubborn young man stuck with his annoying little sister Lex. The constant bickering added to the positive attributes of both characters. The others were really good, but I guess I can't say that they were memorable. Nedry was this fat guy who I consider to be the annoying one. This novel was violent, and I really liked that. What would one expect from unrestrained dinosaurs? Obviously violence. I can honestly say that the things that happened in the novel were plausible. If a mad scientist one day decided to really invest in this, I believe there's a possibility. Anything is possible people, anything. I'm a pre-med student, and there's no saying that I may become a mad scientist one day and eradicate the human race by reviving dinosaurs. Just kidding.The plot was really good. Not perfect, but it was satisfactory. Quite similar to Micro in a way, but it had its own unique attributes. The ending clearly was not cliche in any way, because the last few chapters were awesome. Mind rattling and full of suspense.For any Sci-Fi fans out there, and especially dinosaur lovers, this is the novel for you. Stop hesitating and just pick this up. I assure you that you will not be disappointed in the end. I have the sequel sitting around in my shelf, and I might pick that up next after a few other novels. 5/5 stars, deserves nothing less, but it think it deserve some more."}, {"userName": "Ashley Daviau", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35915119-ashley-daviau", "userReview": "I was a little hesitant to read this book because I have such an immense love and appreciation for the movies.

They were varied and three dimensional. But, there\u2019s someone I really hated, and that\u2019s Lex.I wanted to kill Lex most of the time. She acted her age, but god, she was so so so annoying. Grant, Tim and her could be talking about something important, and then she would say something random or stupid to bother Tim. What the hell?Maybe this is a coincidende, but in all the books I\u2019ve read and there is a kid as a major character, I hate him/her. It happened to me when reading The Shining. I couldn\u2019t stand Danny. Most of the time I wanted to shake him and slap him and make him disappear. And now it\u2019s the same thing with Lex! Ugh. I hate children.There was another thing that bothered me too in the book, and it is that Jurassic Park delivers the message that science (and therefore scientists) are evil \u2013 that all are scientists are arrogant and believe themselves gods and that they do what they do only for money.That\u2019s arguably right sometimes, but I hate when people generalise things. You see, I study chemistry, and I really hate it when people think I chose that because of the money. Other times, people tell me I should have studied something else because \u201call chemists do is create drugs and bombs that kill people \u2013 they\u2019re in the world just to harm.\u201dIn this book, however, is more general and it talks about ALL scientists. The one who delivers all these monologues is the mathematician Malcolm, and his speeches couldn\u2019t be more annoying \u2013 not because of the content but because they were so repetitive.But there\u2019s also the other message, which I rather loved, and that is not to play gods. Stories where people act like gods are fascinating and scary at the same time, and the latter point is because they always end badly. Just see how things got in this book\u2026 or look at Jurassic World, or books like Frankenstein and tell me if you agree with me.I\u2019ve just noticed most of my review is me whining and complaining, but this book was really amazing. I loved the movie and I loved the book even more. I just had to point out the negatives.Still, I recommend this wholeheartedly. If you like the movie, you will LOVE the book. Don\u2019t worry about my complaints \u2013 maybe they won\u2019t bother you. The problem here was me and my impossibility of not seeing the negatives first....Pre-review:Parts of this book reminded me to The Monstrumologist, but with dinosaurs instead of Anthropophagi. Overall, it was good and I enjoyed it, but I have some complaints. Review to come."}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon", "userReview": "\"Scientists are actually preoccupied with accomplishment. So they are focused on whether they can do something. They never stop to ask if they should do something.\"In 1993, Steven Spielberg brought dinosaurs to life on the big screen. At the time, Jurassic Park was so immensely popular that I would be shocked to find someone today who hasn't seen it. Now, with the forthcoming release of Jurassic World, dinosaurs are all the rage again. During a routine trip to the book store, I picked up both Jurassic Park and The Lost World for a pretty good price.Before I cracked the cover on Jurassic Park, I skimmed through a few reviews online. Many of the reviews stated that there are pretty noticeable differences between the novel and the movie. Right away, this had me excited. I'm a read the book, see the movie kind of guy - not the other way around. I find that if I've seen the movie first, I have a hard time forming my own vision in my head. Maybe I have no imagination. Who knows?As far as differences go, \"noticeable\" is an understatement. While the science behind the dino resurrection stays the same (blood from mosquitoes in amber), many of the characters are completely different. Don\u2019t worry, Goldblum's Ian Malcolm is still as self-righteous as ever but the biggest difference is that of John Hammond. In the movie, he comes across as this overgrown child full of wonder whereas in the book, he\u2019s this arrogant, egotistical man seemingly without compassion. He\u2019s also infallible. The best example of this comes from the discussion on the velociraptors. In the novel, Malcolm calls Hammond out on the fact that everyone had been surprised at just how vicious the raptors were, that they often killed and maimed workers. It never once entered into Hammond\u2019s head that they could do without one less species running around.I\u2019ve never read a Crichton novel before but the man can really turn up the tension to eleven. The best example being the use of the velociraptors. Like the movie, they\u2019re presented as the story\u2019s main villains (although several characters allude to it not being their fault, that they\u2019re just hunting and eating to survive) and the scenes in which they\u2019re stalking the main characters had me speed reading.Aside from the raptors, you had that meat grinder on legs, the Tyrannosaurus Rex. For an eight ton killing machine, he sure can lurk in the shadows. Just when Alan and the kids (Tim and Lex) think they've escaped his wrath, he jumps out and scares the ever loving shit out of them. This leads to Lex saying on two occasions \u201cI hate him\u201d which made me laugh each time Crichton had her say it.For as great as the book is, I feel there\u2019s certainly something lost in the pages. Jurassic Park is a story that is so visual that nothing in the novel could compare to seeing a dinosaur come to life before your eyes on the big screen. While I felt the original story is a lot stronger than the one presented in the movie, it\u2019s hard to imagine one without the other. That being said, I could go on and on about all the subtle differences here and there but that would cause this review to extend to an uncomfortable length. So, I\u2019ll just link to this page here. I would stay away from it if you intend to read the novel as it\u2019s basically spoilers.I\u2019ll close by saying if you've only ever seen the movie, you NEED to read this book. The sheer amount of work put forth by Michael Crichton makes you wonder if he was secretly cloning dinosaurs on the side.Also posted @ Every Read Thing."}, {"userName": "Kostas Papadatos", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26165640-kostas-papadatos", "userReview": "\u03a3\u03af\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03bf \u03b8\u03b1 \u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b8\u03ce \u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf, \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Jurassic Park \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5 \u03bf Michael Crichton. \u039d\u03b1\u03b9, \u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03ae \u03b8\u03b1 \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c6\u03ae\u03be\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c7\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5, \u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03af\u03c8\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ae \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u0392\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03b9\u03cc\u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5.

Who doesn\u2019t like dinosaurs and rip-roaring adventure? I hadn\u2019t however read the book that started it all...Going through the pages, I couldn\u2019t help trying to find the scenes that I knew so well. Most are there, but indeed in a different form due to the medium, the same applying to the characters. What fun to hear Malcolm\u2019s Chaos theories and witness Grant\u2019s survival!This is a compelling thriller with a brilliant theme but somehow, having been so immersed in the movies, it lessened the awe inspiring moments. I do wonder how it would have felt to read this knowing nothing - much more powerful for sure. Nonetheless, Crichton\u2019s novels still shines and offers a lot more than the film. Having said this, there is an element that shadowed my enjoyment: sexism. Was the world still so sexist in 1991? In my mind, it wasn\u2019t that long ago and so I wasn\u2019t expecting it, but perhaps yes indeed. It mostly took the shape of 'little digs\u2019 but they were everywhere. Ellie thankfully is portrayed as a skilled scientist but Lex was truly horrible and annoying.

Imagine yourself a prey, being hunted by the one of the most deadliest predators that ever roamed the earth. The Tyrannosaurus Rex. About 30 feet of pure muscle with a massive head that contains the biggest set of teeth that could turn your flesh and bones into mush in one bite.You are trapped. You have nowhere to go. Your entire body is shaking. RAWWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! You might or might not have peed in your pants.RAWWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! Your life starts to flash before your eyes.Then, out of nowhere, some asshole decides to babble on about the chaos theory, which at first seems interesting but then after a few pages you're just rooting that some dinosaur, any dinosaur would kill the smart-ass Ian Malcolm. The scientific explanation at the start was necessary and refreshing. The explanation on how they were able to clone and control the dinosaurs were also important. But that balding self-confessed rockstar who only wore black and grey really knows how to spoil some excitement. I found his endless babble about chaos and unpredictability to be quite a party-pooper, just when you're getting some inch of excitement he's gonna want to talk again. He's like a drunk preacher with an extreme fetish for grimness. There were some really nice bits of information, but I think it was a little too much. Shaved a star off because of that guy. Maybe Crichton was aiming for environmental moralism with him, I dunno. Didn't work for me, just managed to annoy me. Well, at least Jeff Goldblum managed to salvage the character in the movie. I liked him much better there. But that pretty much sums up my Jurassic Park experience. Excitement in some parts then annoyance with Malcolm, then excitement again, then there goes Malcolm again talking. You get the drift. Anyway let me give you one last roar before I end. RAWWWWWWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!There, much better. P.S. - I was really annoyed that they messed up Lex's character in the movie. She was my favorite character in the book, and the movie guys screwed her up. She turned up to be a stupid-vegetarian 11 y.o. when she was supposed to be a cute 7 y.o. sports bully.

I don't think it would be inaccurate to say the movie franchise (especially with the most recent entry of Jurassic World) has significantly overshadowed the book. Heck, I only just got to reading it now, 23 years after the movie was released. Having recently seen the movie, I was struck by the differences between the novel and the movie. Some changes were welcomed, others lost some of the book's depth in the translation.First off most of the characters are portrayed a bit differently in the movie from the book. In the book John Hammond is not the lovable grandfatherly figure Richard Attenborough portrayed in the movie. Book Hammond was rather narcissistic and self-absorbed. Where as the Movie Hammond experienced some humility by the end, it seemed like Book Hammond had a restraining order out against that emotion. Nothing could possibly go wrong with his brilliant idea, the government was an unnecessary impediment on human progress, and when things do go wrong they are the fault of his (highly trained specialist) underlings and their lack of vision. He is a nice enough man if you are agreeable with him, but if you cross him he will treat you rather poorly. All in all a less sympathetic (though a bit more believeable) of a character.Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler are not romantically involved in the book and there is in fact a large age difference between them. This pleased me because it allowed the characters to shine without having to devote time to a romantic plot-line or undercurrent. They are both very capable and knowledgeable in the book and easy to root for. While separated for most of the book they are very calm and collected under pressure and maintain an effective mentor-student relationship. They were great in the movie, but I think I liked them more in the book.Jeff Goldblum is Ian Malcolm, nuff said.John Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson from the movie and Park Operator), Henry Wu (chief scientist), and Robert Muldoon (big game hunter and park warden) are explored in much more depth than in the movie and provide some fascinating insights into the events as they unfold. Arnold comes from en engineering and theme park operations background. As such he views the park through his own experiences, knowing that things will go wrong and how to best deal with them. He isn't caught up in the grand vision of Hammond and treats the park problems as things that will occur as a matter of course and that can be fixed.Wu, the brilliant scientist behind the miracle of resurrected dinosaurs, views things through a highly scientific lens. He is much more interested in the process and methodology that went into creating them than the end product. He isn't married to the notion of bring back dinos as they were, but instead pushes to explore how they could be using the techniques he has developed. He clashes with Hammond on this topic, wanting to expand science while Hammond is more than content with just cranking out existing dinos and not meddling with their appearance.Muldoon is a former big game hunter turned conservationist. He has hunted plenty of dangerous game and has no rosy eyed vision on what dinos are: they are big, smart, dangerous creatures that should be treated with respect of rocket launchers, depending on what the situation calls for. He knows what needs to be done when things (inevitably) go wrong and provides a very pragmatic view of the park and its inhabitants.All in all, the secondary characters provide a wide and nuanced view of the experiment Hammond is trying to pull off. This really gave the book a very nice bit of depth beyond \"Amusement Park Tries to Kill its Guests.\" Where as the movie was very much about surviving dino related deaths, the book took time to explore different views on the park and serve as a cautionary tale about pushing the boundaries of science too quickly. Malcolm seems to be the avatar of this view, noting \"Story of our species, everyone knows its coming, but not so soon.\" Crichton also adds in some moments of levity so it isn't all scientific doom and gloom/raptor attacks:\n\"I don't see him [juvenile T-Rex] at the moment.\"\"Maybe he's down hunting the apostasaurs.\"\"He would if he could, believe me. Sometimes he stands by the lagoon and stares at the animals, and wiggles those little forearms in frustration.\"\nBut this was by no means a flawless book. I thought Crichton got a little too hung up on technical details and spelled some things out a but to specifically when a general comment would have sufficed. This was especially true as we are shown the computer interface that must be used to save the day at the end. Speaking of the end, I felt the book end was rather sloppy. Instead of ending like the movie with the survivors flying away, Crichton decided that Grant et. al. needed to do a a head count of all the raptors to insure that none escaped to the mainland. While possible important, it really threw the flow off of the narrative. All in all, though, this book was quite riveting. Up until the end it had a great pace, fascinating characters, and a great plot. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book."}, {"userName": "Dany Burns", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51266245-dany-burns", "userReview": "Before I start my book review a have to say that i have never seen the movie,  Jurassic Park.  I have no idea how I haven't watched it yet, and I definitely want to watch it now that I have read the book, but this review will not be comparing the two since I have not seen the movie. I did really like this book a lot. I thought that the idea was really well executed and very entertaining. I know not everyone may like this but I loved all the information about genetics and chaos theory. I think the chaos theory stuff especially may have been confusing for some reader but I think it was explained very well and I was also kind of familiar with chaos theory so I could follow along well. There were some parts of this book I didn't love or just found kind of weird. I wish that Dr. Ellie Sattler had had a bigger role in this book because she really kind of disappeared after the first parts of the book. I also wish that Crichton had made Lex a little less whiny. I know she's only like 7 but I think he could have lessened that part of her personality a bit. I also thought it was very strange how the characters call some dinosaurs \"he\" when they are all female. Like there is actually a line in the book where a character explains that all the dinosaurs are female but they call some of the larger ones, like the T-Rex, males. That is so weird to me and it also feels completely unnecessary. They is no plot reason why some of the large dinosaurs need to be called males when they are females and I wish that hadn't been done. I did really like how all the parts abut dinosaurs were written and how the reader could tell and picture what all the different breeds of dinosaurs were like. Overall I am glad that I picked up this book. I definitely want to read more Crichton in the future and I think this was a good introduction to his writing. I liked the dinosaurs in this book as well as all of the human characters. It was very entertaining and enjoyable as well as educational and I definitely want to watch the movie now."}, {"userName": "Ashley *Hufflepuff Kitten*", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29787548-ashley-hufflepuff-kitten", "userReview": "[THANK GODS HAMMOND IS DEAD.

His assurance that science will always go wrong makes for easy potboiler plots, but you do get the feeling that if he were a caveman, he would mistrust a sharpened stick.Crichton's sensationalism and misuse of scientific concepts has made him untrustworthy as a guide on any serious issue, but in the case of runaway dinosaurs, we do not need to heed his warnings about the 'dangers of cloning'; we can simply enjoy an idea that was ridiculous before Crichton ever touched it.At least we are spared the author's libelous personal attacks in this book.

Life breaks free. Life expands to new territories. Painfully, perhaps even dangerously. But life finds a way.\"Four dinolicious stars!This summer as Jurassic World was rawring into theaters everywhere, my best friend confessed something to me; she had never seen Jurassic Park. Or any of the sequels. I decided that we could no longer be friends.I kid. But seriously, Jurassic Park was the defining movie of my childhood. Every time it was on TV, I was there. Even just the theme music got my pulse going. The kitchen scene! The T-Rex in the rain! For a baby horror junkie, it was sweet, sweet crack. And shirtless Jeff Goldbloom...excuse me while I drool.So, does the book live up to what is in my top five movies of all time? Honestly no. This was the odd case of the movie version blowing the book out of the water. But it is still a solidly entertaining thriller.\"There is a problem with that island. It is an accident waiting to happen.\"I knew where the basic storyline was going to go. It didn't stop me from rolling my eyes, and thinking 'You idiot, you are going to get eaten. Oh you are so dino chow.' Knowing most of the twists and turns that the plot was going to take didn't bother me. It was still enjoyable despite that. I liked the attention paid to the science of things. It got super sciencey at times, but in a good way I guess? Without science, there would be no story.\"Science cannot help us decide what to do with the world, or how to live. Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it cannot tell us not to build it. Science can make pesticide, but cannot tell us not to use it.\"I also liked the characters (mostly). Again, I couldn't help but compare to the movie. Hammond was drastically different. Instead of a well intentioned, naive dreamer, he is portrayed here as power hungry and hypocritical. He can overlook deaths, maimings, even his grandchildren being endangered if it means his dream will be realized. And to him it WILL be realized. He never thinks otherwise.I say I liked most of the characters. But there was one exception. A big one.Lex. Stupid, whiny, useless Lex. She's 8, but acts like she's 5. She contributes nothing to the story except to annoy and pester those around her and almost get people killed. She never seems to realize that hey, you are in very real danger of dying a horrible death. 8 year olds get the concept of death right? Then she cries about everything; because she can't play with the walkie talkie. Or there's no ice cream. Or that Tim isn't paying attention to her. GET THE FUCK OVER IT CHILD. You are 8 years old and are about to be eaten by dinosaurs. Be grateful that you still have both legs! I have never actively rooted for a child to get eaten before in my life.So. Movie-Lex = good. Book-Lex = bad. Very bad.Aside from annoying-child-syndrome Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park was a really enjoyable thriller. I suspect I would enjoy almost anything set in the \"Jurassic Park\" universe. I'll get around to reading The Lost World eventually.If I don't get eaten first."}], "description": "En esta espectacular novela, los dinosaurios vuelven a conquistar la Tierra.
