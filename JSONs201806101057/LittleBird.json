It didn't matter, though, because she flew. She flew!\u2019Author Seth Chambers has worked as an army medic, mental health counselor, farm hand, wilderness guide, bike messenger, and ESL teacher. His work has appeared in F&SF, Daily SF, Fantasy Scroll, and Perihelion SF, and The 2015 Year's Best Science Fiction And Fantasy Novellas. He is the author of WHAT ROUGH BEASTS, THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MONSTERS, WE HAPPY FEW, BEAUTIFUL MACHINES, DETROIT, RUSTY BOLTS, A LITTLE SLICE OF HELL, THE UNFOGIVING MINUTE, TOURIST SEASON, BLUE DEVILS, EDITORIAL LIFELINES, THIS RESTLESS NIGHT, HER RULE WOULD ALWAYS LAST, MORNING AND NIGHT, UNIVERSE IN A TEACUP, LITTLE EINSTEIN, YOU BETTER WATCH OUT, and now LITTLE BIRD. His genre is cyberpunk, fantasy, hard science fiction, and in this vein he has already gained recognition and awards.Seth wastes no superfluous words \u2013 he gets to his character development quick and surely and leaves ample room for character development and growth \u2013 and secrets. For example, his unveiling of his heroine is as follows \u2013 \u2018Even before she had words for \"heart\" and \"blood,\" she sensed the fluttery bird pushing life water throughout her body. She felt the blood pulse and flow through tiny tubes in her limbs and even sensed the one-way valves that kept it from backing up into her heart. Long before she had words, she knew her organs and what they did. She sent her consciousness through her body: watching, listening, learning. A man placed a cold, round piece of metal on her chest and she knew he was listening to that fluttery little bird within. She sped it up so that its individual beats blurred together so fast they no longer pushed the fluid through the tubes. Then she slowed it way, way down so the beats came only at long intervals. A commotion arose. The man with the round piece of metal seemed upset. She didn't mean to upset him. She let the little bird in her chest beat as it normally did. The man smiled at her and she smiled back. She liked the man. She felt her pupils open wide to let in more of this man's face. She grabbed two of his fingers in her tiny hand and held tight. The man tried to pull away but could not. Not until she let him. The man turned toward her Baba and made sounds: \"She's strong.\" She didn't know what the sounds meant. She just knew she liked the man and she loved her Baba. She felt the muscles in her face move in response to him. \"And very cute,\" added the man. Her Baba looked down at her. \"She's still a girl.\" She didn't know what the sound meant but she didn't like the feel of them in her ears. Then her Baba turned away and walked out of the room. Song Shia cried but Baba stayed gone. She knew that someday she would learn to make the right sounds, the sounds that would make Baba come back.\u2019Eloquent and magnetic, the passage invites the reader into this strange and beautiful story.The synopsis provides a guide map to what is ahead \u2013 \u2018There was always something different about Sun Song Shia, but like most little girls she just wanted to be loved. Strangely, it wasn't until the Chinese government stuck her in a research facility did she find the love and acceptance she craved. Song Shia returned to her parents only to be met with wariness and even fear. She craved her Baba's love most of all, but that love came at a terrible price. Song Shia fled China all the way to the Safe Zone city of Chicago. Even there she was monitored and strictly regulated by the government. Despite it all, Song Shia fell in love with a museum curator named Alex. Right from the beginning Song Shia warned Alex to \"Run like hell!\" Alex did not run. As their romance developed, Song Shia reluctantly brought Alex further into her world. Then their life together exploded when a devastating secret was exposed: a secret Song Shia kept not only from the world, but from herself.\u2019Many levels of significant philosophy are contained in this fantasy book. Not only will fans of sci-fi/fantasy be satisfied (\u2018When she was seven her bones began breaking for no reason at all, and then fixing themselves again. It hurt and yet felt good all at the same time. She also heard music whenever her bones started to break. It was beautiful, wonderful music that nobody else could hear. If she thought about it really hard, she could bend her arms in several places at once.), but readers who are sensitive to those aspects that make a child into an adult will be also well served. This is a fine little novel."}, {"userName": "Ed Morawski", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21214612-ed-morawski", "userReview": "Song Shia can have any man she wants \u2013 and she definitely snagged me. I was hooked from page one. This book is a rather fabulous mixture of contrasts. On the one hand the story is touching when it tells about the childhood Song Shia \u2013 and the rest of the time it is a sexual fantasy beyond any man\u2019s wildest dreams when the adult Song Shia is around. I can\u2019t explain much without revealing a significant spoiler so suffice to say it is compelling and wildly sexy in alternate chapters. Early in the book Song Shia the little girl wants to fly and I nearly lost it at what happened as the little girl jumps from a tall tree, furiously reading to learn the result. The author really has a knack for drawing you in with simple prose that nevertheless makes you invested in the story.And just when you think the story can\u2019t get better, or there can\u2019t be any more surprises, it comes up with something new\u2014especially about half way through when Song does something you won\u2019t see coming.And just when you think the story can\u2019t get any stranger or surprise you, at the three quarters mark, it does, again.All the while I was fascinated and amused and a little sad that Song couldn\u2019t be herself. Until the end, the marvelous, awesome end. I\u2019m not sad any more.And oh what a character Song Shia is \u2013 one of my favorites in a long, long time."}, {"userName": "Chelseyam", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3933110-chelseyam", "userReview": "Growing up with stories like X-Men, I have always been fascinated by those who would be considered mutants. The main character in this book would certainly fit into that category, even though her power would typically be seen as heroic. Rather, she can charm any man she pleases. This ability lands her in a lot of trouble, which the author crafts masterfully. I love the way the character was developed, and the dialogue presented, because it makes her seem so real. This always amplifies a book for me and makes me want to know more. You can tell, the author put a lot of work into creating such a novel as it is easy to be drawn into the world straight away. Of course, there are some heartbreaking moments, but you will really love every second of this novel. I would recommend it to sci-fi fans, but anyone interested in something new and exciting might also enjoy this story."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67760105-carol", "userReview": "Little Bird is the story of a Chinese young woman named Sun Song Shia. Song has a secret and was being studied by the Chinese government before she was able to get away and come to the US to Chicago. She longs to not only be with the parents who gave her up but also Baba. In Chicago she meets Alex who is a museum curator and she tries (like most people in a romance that have a terrible secret) to get him to leave her alone but naturally he doesn\u2019t listen. The story is told in first person from Alex and third person for Song which I thought was pretty cool. I can say that if I had some ability like Song, I wouldn\u2019t know how to handle it either and I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want to be stuck in some medical facility against my will and be studied like that."}, {"userName": "Jimmy Jefferson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67198180-jimmy-jefferson", "userReview": "A fantasy thriller with erotic overturesThis is a story of a woman with some unique abilities and discovers herself while we take this journey with her. Can you imagine what it would be like if you could have every woman you had ever fantasized about? The possibilities are endless and the journey exquisite. The author does a great job of telling this story and drawing the reader along page by page to discover the secrets enclosed within. I found the characters well developed and the story very fun and easy to follow. I would recommend everyone with desires take the journey and tell me what you think of the book."}], "description": "There was always something different about Sun Song Shia, but like most little girls she just wanted to be loved.
