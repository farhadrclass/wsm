Reading his memories of his life and anecdotes from those that knew him shows a truly wonderful man who cared about everyone around him. It's amazing what he could remember and that at the age of 108 (when he wrote the book) he had such a clarity of mind. I have to confess that at times I had tears in my eyes knowing that Harry had just passed on. If you want to read about a real hero then this is the book for you."}, {"userName": "Gerry", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15162550-gerry", "userReview": "This book held a very interesting topic on the life of one Englishman who served his country well. Mr. Patch never wanted to be a soldier; but, when he was called upon he didn\u2019t schlep his responsibility to the need of the time. Born at the end of the Victorian era; he was raised in an Edwardian time; a time that has long left us here in the 21st century and the England to which he was born, raised, and lived has long since become a different nation all together. Mr. Van Emden is an effective researcher and I speculate a humble sort of interviewer in this book by rights of passages that are easily understandable. I fully appreciated the easy to read type in this book, and Mr. Van Emden\u2019s ability to tie the story together through out. Mr. Harry Patch was quite the decent man and there are simply too many passages to call my \u201cfavorite\u201d; however, near the end of the book Mr. Patch clearly told the author in reflection of his age and being the Last Fighting Tommy that \u201c\u2026my whole generation fought that war in the trenches\u2026\u201d Mr. Patch came to despise war and even after having two sons fight in the Second World War his disdain for war was met with the sorrow that comes with war. As the First World War was a personal touch for him and his injuries \u2013 so too the Second World War would leave the Patch family to some degree without loved ones.My interest in this book was based on the title of one British Soldier, one common ranked person who had to struggle during his time frame. I couldn\u2019t have come across a better accounting of the time frame as a whole. The book, published in 2007 the topic and subject of Mr. Patch is born in 1898; Mr. patch would pass away in 2009 at the age 111 years young and his mental acuity intact for the age he became. The pre-war years of 1914 were quite an interesting read with occasional references to the time this was recorded for History in reflection to friends and family that were (then) in the stories of boyhood and long gone during the time of the research. Mr. Patch showed even in this late part of his life the recollections of childhood, boys getting into trouble, an education that was quite different. Before going into Military Service on behalf His Majesty and nation he earned his plumbing certification at 17.5 years of age. A skill that stayed with him for the remainder of his life serving his community and making an honest living for his family. Following the book, I finished on the Canadian Expeditionary Forces in \u201cMerry Hell\u201d by Captain Robert Clements (edited by Mr. Brian D. Tennyson) the dove tail effect of the battles that Mr. Patch and Captain Clements faced is rather an interesting verification of stories written. The Canadian Ross Rifle vs the British Lee-Enfield and the successful Lewis Machine Gun. Rum shots in the morning that burned going down but warmed one up were common to British, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealander troops. A touching part of this story on the battlefield is more telling when Mr. Patch wanted to stop and gain information on a British Soldier he passed before he himself was injured and the Soldier laying on the ground that he was passing enroute to battle was badly injured but still alive. As this young boy lay on the field dying and bleeding Mr. Patch could hear this lad making his last gasps of breath \u2013 taking those gasps the young man called out to his Mother, but called out to her in a manner to which she was \u201cstanding there\u201d as opposed to \u201ccalling out for her\u201d \u2013 Mr. Patch would never get over this experience; he wasn\u2019t allowed to gather personal information on this boy as he wished so that he himself could have written a letter to his loved ones back in England. He would never watch a war movie nor did he later care for the entry to the Second World War. He was a man who wanted to live, experience, and share with others.This book isn\u2019t just about war \u2013 it is about life \u2013 a life that crossed both World Wars. A life that saw many changes to his England and United Kingdom. May Mr. Harry Patch and the \u201cLast Fighting Tommy\u201d Rest in Peace \u2013 he lived over all a decent life; one that was committed to others."}, {"userName": "Shirley Revill", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14433136-shirley-revill", "userReview": "I really enjoyed reading this book about Harry Patch the last Tommy the oldest surviving veteran of the trenches.Harry reached the age of 111 and I believe he wrote his memoirs at the age of 105 sharing his memories with all of us.Even though I was born years after the war I shall be forever grateful to men like Harry and it was a privilege to read about his life.This to me is real history, the history of an ordinary man who turned out to be anything but ordinary.God bless you Harry Patch."}, {"userName": "Val Penny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28379554-val-penny", "userReview": "I usually avoid books with more than one author. However, I was interested to read about Henry (Harry) Patch, an ordinary man who got coaught up in both World War I and lived through World War II. I found a book written about him just after his death. However, I then noticed The Last Fighting Tommy: The Life of Harry Patch, the Oldest Surviving Veteran of the Trenches. Harry Patch was the last British soldier alive to have fought in the trenches of the First World War. He was one of very few people who could directly recall the horror of that conflict.The delightful thing about this book is that the chapters about Harry's life are by him. The historical chapters and historical background is provided by Richard van Emden who is a British author and television documentary producer. He specializes in the First World War. The personal account and a knowledgable historian, is a good combination. The strength of this book lies in the ordinariness of its subject. History is full of hype, stories sold as block-busters, embellished beyond plausibility, myth usurping truth. Not so thoughout The Last Fighting Tommy.Harry was born in 1898, during the reign of Queen Victoria and a year before my maternal grandmother. His childhood was spent in the Somerset countryside of Edwardian England. He left school in 1913 to become an apprentice plumber but three years later was conscripted, serving as a machine gunner in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. Harry Patch comes across as a sensitive, humble man. Apparently he did not want to tell his story. However, by pure accident, he became the single living connection to an unimaginable experience in another time: life in the World War I trenches. He was persuaded to tell his story; understated, honest, un-heroically.He describes life in the mud and trenches during the Battle of Passchendaele. He saw a great many of his comrades die, and in one dreadful moment the shell that wounded him also killed his three closest friends. In vivid detail he describes daily life in the trenches, the terror of being under intense artillery fire, and the fear of going over the top. A large part of the book covers Harry's experiences in World War I as he was forced to give up on his career and go to fight. The chapter about when he went over the top is mesmerising as it captures one man's experience of the horrors of the war, rather than an overview that we usually get. Then, after the Armistice he explains the soldiers' frustration at not being quickly demobbed. This led to a mutiny in which even Harry was caught up. The Last Fighting Tommy is not a history book, it is a book about one man's experiences of history, although the co-author, Richard van Emden does provide relevant historical detail and background.Harry shared with the reader about his whole life without boring them with every little detail: he revealed what he thought would be most interesting and it works really well. There is a great section on World War II where Harry describes being a firefighter and dealing with the aftermath of the bombings on Bath. World War II saw Harry in action on the home front as a fire-fighter during the bombing of Bath. He also warmly described his friendship with American GIs preparing to go to France, and, years later, his tears when he saw their graves.Late in life Harry achieved fame, meeting the Queen and taking part in the BBC documentary The Last Tommies, finally shaking hands with a German veteran of the artillery and speaking out frankly to the then Prime Minister Tony Blair about the soldiers shot for cowardice in the First World War. This was a well-done book which told the life of an ordinary man who lived through extraordinary things. On the one hand it is history told through the eyes of someone who was there, whilst on the other hand he represents all the men who fought in the trenches. I found The Last Fighting Tommy a fascinating read and highly recommend it to all who enjoy history and biographies.Valerie Penny"}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan", "userReview": "The Last Fighting Tommy tells the story of Harry Patch, the longest surviving veteran of the trenches. 2014 marks 100 years since the start of World War I so I thought now would be a good time to read this book that has been sat on my shelf for years and years. Harry Patch died in 2009, aged 111, and given that the book was published in 2007 it does cover the vast majority of his long life. As one would expect a fair chunk of the book covers Harry's experiences in World War I as he was forced to give up on his career and go and fight. The chapter about when he went over the top is mesmerising as it captures one man's experience of the horrors of the war, rather than an overview that we usually get. I think at times the man behind the project, Richard Van Emden, lost track of the purpose of the book and his sections go far too much into the detailed history than is needed. This is not a history book, it is a book about one man's experiences of history. I did think this job did a good job pretty reasonable job of covering most of Harry's life rather than just the four months he spent in the trenches. Harry told us about his whole life without boring us with every little detail- he shared what he thought would be most interesting and it works really well. There is a great section on World War II where Harry describes being a firefighter and dealing with the aftermath of the bombings on Bath.

Buku ini bukanlah sebuah buku autobiografi/memoir perang yang lazimnya. Jika anda mahukan sebuah buku yang yang menceritakan keperwiraan anggota tentera menumpaskan musuhnya,dengan aksi-aksi pertempuran yang dinyatakan dengan jelas,buku ini bukanlah buku yang sesuai untuk anda.Buku ini mengisahkan Henry John \"Harry\" Patch,seorang veteran Perang Dunia Pertama,yang sehingga kematiannya pada 25 Julai 2009,merupakan satu-satunya veteran perang tersebut yang masih hidup (mendiang lahir pada 17 Jun 1898,meninggal dunia pada umur 111 tahun). Dengan kerjasama dan bantuan Richard Van Emden sebagai penulis bersama (co-writer),Harry Patch turut menyumbang sebagai penulis utama buku ini. Buku ini dihasilkan sebelum kematian beliau iaitu pada tahun 2007.Untuk beberapa bab awal,kita mungkin merasakan bahawa buku ini sebuah buku autobiografi/memoir yang biasa sahaja,tiada keistimewaannya. Itulah apa yang saya rasa ketika mula membaca buku ini. Tetapi,semakin lama saya membaca,semakinlah saya suka membaca isi kandungan buku ini. Apa yang menarik perhatian saya adalah betapa sederhana dan rendah dirinya manusia yang bernama Harry Patch ini. Beliau tidak mengambil kesempatan statusnya sebagai seorang veteran Perang Dunia Pertama untuk 'menjaja' dirinya sebagai wira atau hero perang tersebut. Sebaliknya,beliau lebih menumpukan kisah kehidupan peribadinya sewaktu beliau kecil sehinggalah apabila mencapai usia lebih 100 tahun.Walaupun saya tidak menangis ketika membaca buku ini,namun,tidak dinafikan,kadang-kala,timbul juga perasaan sebak. Beliau bertuah kerana berumur panjang dan menyaksikan banyak peristiwa sejarah berlaku sepanjang hidupnya. Namun,pada masa yang sama,beliau juga bernasib malang kerana menyaksikan satu demi satu,orang-orang tersayangnya meninggalkan dirinya buat selama-lamanya dan ini termasuklah tiga orang isteri dan dua orang anaknya (dari perkongsian hidup dengan isteri pertamanya yang bernama Ada). Buku ini sebuah buku mengenai kehidupan yang mengajar kita untuk menghargai kehidupan kita dan orang-orang tersayang yang berada di sisi kita. If you are looking a bravado and action-packed autobiography/memoir book of World War One,this is not a book which is suitable for you.Simply,this is a book about life,and how we must cherish it together with people around us. This is a book about Henry John \"Harry\" Patch,the last British World War One veteran,now deceased (2009). This book is written in 2007 by Harry Patch himself,with Richard Van Emden as co-author. This book covers Harry Patch's life chronicle from childhood until well over age 100. What made this book is so great and interesting to read is how humble his life is. Probably,like majority of World War One veterans,he came from not larger-than-life background. His life may look ordinary and mundane,but like any other men,also has its own challenges and excitement. He is destined to have a long life,which enables him to watch many histories unfolded,especially the era of 20th century. But,in the same time,he is also been condemned to watch nearly all his beloved ones,perish one by one,which includes his wives and two sons."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4455388-angela", "userReview": "This fairly short book tells of the life of Harry Patch, described on the cover as \u201cthe only surviving veteran of the trenches\u201d, but this is certainly not a book solely about war. Harry Patch was born in June 1898, towards the end of Queen Victoria\u2019s reign, and during his lifetime, the world changed incredibly quickly. For me, the social history of the late 19th century, stretching through to the end of the 20th century and beyond, is one of the most interesting aspects of this book. Changes in customs and manners, as well as in technology, created a world that was very different towards the end of Harry\u2019s life than that at the beginning.As Harry Patch was so old, his words had been recorded and then transcribed by Richard Van Emden. Much of the story is told in Harry\u2019s words, with insertions by Van Emden which give historical background, especially during the years of World War 1. This was a technique that I think worked very well. The book flowed well and the insertions helped to create an accurate context for Harry\u2019s memories.I was struck by the honesty of the book. Harry Patch makes no secret of the fact that he didn\u2019t want to go to war in 1914; in fact, he was not one of those young men who lied about their age because they were desperate to see action in Europe. He wanted to continue with his apprenticeship as a plumber and it wasn\u2019t until he was \u201ccalled up\u201d that he joined the army and was eventually sent to the trenches which stretched across much of the Western Front. He became part of a small team of five men who manned a Lewis gun. Although he didn\u2019t like army life, he did appreciate the men who made up this team and he describes their support for each other in a moving way.I imagine that people who are interested in 20th century warfare will appreciate the book, but for me, the big message that I found is that life - just ordinary, every day living - is not easy or particularly fair for many people. However, Harry survived not only two World Wars, but over a century of every day living - by hard work, loyal relationships and a flexibility of outlook.I\u2019m glad that I read \u201cThe Last Fighting Tommy.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Derek", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5890265-derek", "userReview": "The Last Fighting Tommy is an interesting book about a remarkable man, Harry Patch.Harry was the last remaining British soldier to survive the Western front. He passed away in July 2009, aged 111 years old. Over 90 years ago, he was sent to fight in the mud and blood of Passchendale.That Harry managed to live so long seems particularly incredible when you read that he had an 2 inch lump of white hot shrapnel blasted into his guts. Meamwhile, all around him his comrades were being blown up. This book is more than another account on WW1 trench life, this is Harry's story. There are no heroes or cowards, there is no patriotism and little bitterness. This is one mans story of how he did his duty and how awful it was. The strong message that this story carries throughout is purely and simply of the futility of war. The heartbreaking passages about his doomed Lewis gun crew, and how they found deep friendship and comradeship are beautifully told. We also hear about his early days in rural Somerset, his long and distinguished years as a master plumber/engineer, and his family life with its ups and some very big downs.Author Richard Van Emden worked meticulously with Harry to produce a very moving account of Harry's life, including the hellish conflict of 1917."}, {"userName": "Eli Castro", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3680049-eli-castro", "userReview": "The man that lives to pass the age of 100 and who knows of his current status this man is no original old mann hes a special man who lived through some of the most historic times.

As of the writing, Harry Patch was 108 years old. His time spent fighting, before being wounded and shipped back to England, totaled little more than four months. Rather, his longevity and his ease in front of the camera brought fame in his later years. The war was something that happened to him and to everyone else. War is something that Patch speaks against in his remembrances, its pointlessness and waste. The darkness of the trenches stands starkly against the near idyllic and pleasant Edwardian childhood he describes in the opening chapters.

Definitely a worthwhile read for those interested in the study of World War I."}, {"userName": "Soeziegoezie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4549115-soeziegoezie", "userReview": "\"I know the first time I went to the line we were scared; we were all scared. We lived hour by hour, we never knew the future. You saw the sun rise, hopefully you'd see it set. If you saw it set, you hoped you'd see it rise. Some men would, some men wouldn't.\"Some so called world leaders should read this book and realize that war leads to absolutely nothing. The story of Harry Patch and all his fellow soldiers should never be forgotten."}, {"userName": "Clare MacGregor", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60931457-clare-macgregor", "userReview": "I loved this book! I had watched a series in which Harry appeared which prompted me to read it. I have lived in the area that he lived in for several years and have family there so I was able to picture a lot of the settings. He seemed to be such a great gentleman and representative of a time gone passed."}, {"userName": "Pauline Smith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18607372-pauline-smith", "userReview": "So grateful to Harry Patch for writing this, its sad but a wonderful read letting us know what our lads went through for our freedom. This was recommended to me from my son who's in the Army. He was giving a copy by a Officer to read, and really made him think of past soldiers and their sacrifices for us."}, {"userName": "Lisa Williamson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3859412-lisa-williamson", "userReview": "great to read the first hand memoires of an ordinary man turned into a world famous war veteran. His tales of boyhood mischief and every day life turns into the fight or his life, with all the harsh realities of life in the trenches thrown in. This is a book to read if you want to hear a true account about WW1."}], "description": "Harry Patch, the last British soldier alive to have fought in the trenches of the First World War, is one of very few people who can directly recall the horror of that conflict.Harry vividly remembers his childhood in the Somerset countryside of Edwardian England. He left school in 1913 to become an apprentice plumber but three years later was conscripted, serving as a machine gunner in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. Fighting in the mud and trenches during the Battle of Passchendaele, he saw a great many of his comrades die, and in one dreadful moment the shell that wounded him kill his three closest friends. In vivid detail he describes daily life in the trenches, the terror of being under intense artillery fire, and the fear of going over the top. Then, after the Armistice, the soldiers' frustration at not being quickly demobbed led to a mutiny in which Harry was soon caught up.The Second World War saw Harry in action on the home front as a fire-fighter during the bombing of Bath. He also warmly describes his friendship with American GIs preparing to go to France, and, years later, his tears when he saw their graves.Late in life Harry achieved fame, meeting the Queen and taking part in the BBC documentary The Last Tommies, finally shaking hands with a German veteran of the artillery and speaking out frankly to Prime Minister Tony Blair about the soldiers shot for cowardice in the First World War.The Last Fighting Tommy is the story of an ordinary man's extraordinary life.
