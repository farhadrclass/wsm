OKAY OKAY...I don't even know where to start. Obviosuly I loved this book, but I'm not sure if I loved it enough to be a TOP favorite of mine, though I really FEEL something, like... I think it'll become one of those books that I'll love more and more with every day that passes. But for now, let's just say that Rainbow Rowell did it again... I'M IN LOVE WITH EVERYTHING SHE WRITES. The first part of this book was a little slow, but as soon as Baz makes his official appearance, everything gets SO MUCH BETTER! Oh, I love that vampire boy so much. But I also love Simon. And Penny. Those three made me laugh so much. I care deeply about them.One thing that surprised me was the Magickal World Rainbow created! I was amazed by it! The spells were so silly and clever (I burst out laughing when the Mage was chanting Bohemian Rhapsody!) and I loved the simplicity of them! I loved the similarities with Harry Potter that at the same time were SO DIFFERENT! And I also loved that Rainbow could manage all that world building in just one book :). I'd definetly read more about this world.Okay, okay, but now let's talk about Simon and Baz TOGETHER. OMG. I couldn't stop giggling in their scenes!!! The synopsis didn't lie: There is SO. MUCH. KISSING. AND I WANTED MORE!!! Rainbow has talent with these cute romantic scenes and all these cute silly banter! I love how their relationship developed and I SIMPLY LOVE THEIR LOVE. I was fangirling so hard I'm sure tears fell from my eyes, I was squealing and yelping whenever they kissed or showed their love for each other. And the ending, OH, THAT ENDING.I mean, it was a little bittersweet (the ending, I mean), and I didn't expect it, but I'm kinda okay with it. And also! This feels like the less open ending that Rainbow has ever written! BRAVO! (But at the same time, she left so many questions unanswered! I wouldn't mind a sequel, I really wouldn't. And I hope Simon gets another chance, if you've read it, you'll know what I mean).BUT YESSS, I'm so happy I finally read this! It was one of my most anticipated reads of this year and it didn't dissappoint :). I think it may become one of my favorites. -----------------------19/10: CRYING TEARS OF JOY BECAUSE I FINALLY HAVE THE TIME TO READ THIS ONE.-----------------------BEFORE READING IT:A SIMON SNOW BOOK.

But in reality, it's her take on FREAKING HARRY POTTER. Anybody who tries to tell me not to compare the two... Just no. Every little thing about this story (the setting, characters, etc.) can easily be traced back to Harry Potter and Hogwarts and EVERYTHING IS THE SAME. Plus, the characters are just plain boring and annoying for the most part. I couldn't find anything enjoyable about this in the 163 pages I read, so I'm going to put this down and never pick it up again.Extended Review (taking comments into account)I am aware that this is SUPPOSED to be a Harry Potter parody/fanfic/whateverthefuck, but that doesn't in any way mean I have to like it. I think this should have been an online fanfiction or something, but a published book? Not on board. Also, like I said above, IT'S JUST PLAIN NOT GOOD.

The story must continue. Simon and Baz shall date and get married and have kids and... and... !Alright, let\u2019s not be too clamorous about this. What we have here is a fantasy. Or rather, my fantasy. But really, who never dreamed of sharing a room with a mysterious and handsome boy who constantly gets on your nerves but who\u2019s secretly head over heels for you?Simon has that. But\u2026 he\u2019s clueless. And Baz sure won\u2019t say anything about his feelings for him because 1. He\u2019s the villain, 2. Baz and Simon\u2019s destinies are to kill each other and 3. Simon\u2019s not gay.But then something happens, forcing them to make a pact forbidding them from slicing each other\u2019s heads off. And now they\u2019re together\u2026 In the same places\u2026 And they\u2026Don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s so much fun.And you know what\u2019s surprising? There\u2019s actually a plot. Yes, you heard me: a plot not only there to fill gaps, but one that really helps to understand the characters and gives deph to the story, surprisingly.When I first started it, I kept comparing it to Harry Potter. Honestly, it\u2019s impossible not to. The only thing is, the book knows it\u2019s a fanfiction story and it feels that way, meaning the writing is casual\u2026 very contemporary-like and, even if the majority of the characters take themselves seriously, the reader can\u2019t help but see humour everywhere.It\u2019s in the spells, which are really just a bunch of idioms and song lyrics.It\u2019s in the magic: wings that sprout out of someone\u2019s back, teleportation, flying\u2026 it\u2019s all for the reader\u2019s entertainment.It\u2019s in the world-building: wizards turned into vampires, numphies who kidnap people for ransom, an heir who can\u2019t keep his magic in control\u2026 anything you can imagine.And I liked that. I liked the fact that Rainbow Rowell didn\u2019t hold back from creating whatever scenes she wanted because she feared they would be too silly. It\u2019s silly, but it\u2019s a good and, strangely, convincing type of silly.I didn\u2019t want to stop reading it. It puts the reader in such a wonderful mood and let me tell you that, even if the romance takes time to appear, when it does, it\u2019s hard not to notice it.As in, you will LOVE Simon & Baz.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "Sorry, this book is just too meta for me, man.This book is about a fictional character who was the subject of fascination in another fictional character's life from another book. It's a story about a made-up character from a series that's fictional inspired from another fictional series? Does that even make any sense? I don't even know. It's just too meta, man!Besides the ludicrous premise of a fictional Harry Potter (can you even have a fictional fanfic of a character who is fiction in the first place? I guess that's what you call <.i>Twilight?). It is all sorts of ludicrous to read a book about a character who is a parody of another character. This isn't tongue-in-cheek so much as it is absolute lunacy.I didn't give two shits about Simon and Baz in Fangirl to be honest. I don't remember much of them at all besides the fact that Simon is the fictional Harry Potter in the Fangirl universe. And I started this book not really giving a damn, hoping the book can convince me otherwise. It didn't.There is no plot.Not having cared about Simon's story in Fangirl, I still don't care about Simon's story now in a fleshed-out book.There is no plot.Literally nothing happens in the book.There is no plot.I have never been so bored reading about a world where vampires and unicorns and ghosts exist.Maybe there is? I don't know. I don't care. I was falling asleep by page 10.Furthermore, this book is just a sad parody at slash fandom. Baz's unrequited feelings towards Simon felt empty and pointless. Let's get this straight, it's not that I'm anti-gay in the least. It's that if you are to include homosexual and bisexual characters in a book, they should be there as a person. There should be a point to their character. They're not there for the purpose of OMG HOT MAN ON MAN ACTION. This may be a little controversial, but I am largely against slash fiction because I feel they're disrespectful to gays, to rewrite a character's sexuality just for the purpose of titillation.\nBaz\u2019s mouth is colder than Agatha\u2019s.Because he\u2019s a boy, I think, and then: No, because he\u2019s a monster.He\u2019s not a monster. He\u2019s just a villain.He\u2019s not a villain.

This book was soft love that feels a lot like when you're standing in the sunlight and you don\u2019t really want to leave and it somehow gives you the sensation of lazily melting into what\u2019s around you as you take it all in. I honestly need to do more to deserve the love I'm feeling right now because I think I'm seriously about to get done for tax evasion. This review is going to be a spoilery mess so if you haven't read the book, DO NOT SCROLL DOWN. Just know that it's basically Harry Potter but gayer. A LOT GAYER. THE GAYER THE MERRIER. Also, Drarry is canon. Mostly, know that this is the kind of book that will make you so giddy you will have to stop reading for a minute and grin or press your face into a pillow and squeal. But if you ever see someone reading it and appearing calm and emotionless, trust me...in reality they're actually on the brink of fucking death\n\u201cYou were the sun, and I was crashing into you. I\u2019d wake up every morning and think, \u2018This will end in flames.\u201d\n(x)\u2728 I'm basically 95% harry potter and 5% bad decisions and reading this book is such a great representative of that\u2728 however, the version of myself who kept putting off reading it for so long is not the version I want physically representing me....because this was such a good book why did I make the concious decision to deprive myself of it??\u2728 me looking back at my decision to not read this sooner: well that um\u2026. really sucks for her\u2728 anyway, I am so grateful for fictional characters and otps for filling the void in me where love should exist as an actual thing and not just an abstract concept. tbh I don't know where I would have been as a person and in society without the option of listening to music and staring at a window while my mind slips away into an alternate reality and I could make up different scenarios involving my favorite ships \u2728 yeah let\u2019s just move on before I sound any weirder  SIMON SNOW\n\u2728 I can't walk up the stairs without wheezing but I would very literally fistfight the fucking moon for Simon Snow\u2728 actually, if I loved him any more, I\u2019d be Baz Pitch\u2728 listen, I have an extreme weakness for characters who are such trashboy dorks their guardian angel probably facepalms himself a lot\u2728 but I also relate to Simon because I, too, am irresponsible and aggressively bisexual and I will always assume that you hate me unless you explicitly tell me you love me and then periodically remind me \u2728 here's a little [ (:: \ud83d\udc96::) ] bandaid for his little heart I hope he's doing his best even though we're all doomed\u2728 most of all, I hope he knows that he wasn't a fraud magician. That his parents were two of the most powerful mages the world of magic has ever known. That he was loved and that his father's awful misdeeds are a reflection of himself and what he values out of relationships. They were never a reflection of Simon or of his worth as a person!!\u2728 anyway I love Simon and I hope the people around him match his capacity to love and also get him lots of cherry scones, god knows he earned that\u2728 even though he drinks butter like it's a fucking smoothie. jesus fucking christ\n\nBAZ PITCH\n\n\u2728 [gently rests my hand on his cheek] I love you but you\u2019re kind of an ass\u2728 listen, Baz is basically me: 1) emotionally, I too identify as the sunglasses emoji: the only reason I wear my shades is to hide the tears. 2) I, too, expect people to like me for who I am without actually giving them anything to like while also having about a 2% tolerance for all of humanity. 3) I'm kind of an asshole too but I\u2019m also very kind-hearted and I like making people happy and if I love you I will love you with all my heart and all my soul but don't be confused, I\u2019m also such a fucking asshole. Oh and I also consider salt and vinegar crips a good substitute for actual food.\u2728 so Baz Pitch is a vampire, both literally and figuratively. Figuratively as in, he likes to suck the joy from any situation and also continues to age and wither on all levels except physically\u2728 look, if you want me to bring out the official adoption papers, just give me a character who comes off as rude and unapproachable until it\u2019s revealed that the reason for this is because they\u2019re fumbling dorks who just don't understand how they're socially supposed to act\u2728 Baz is actually pretty cool. You just have to give him like 10 tries before he gets it right, you feel?\u2728 I mean he would drag you through the fucking dirt while holding a fucking capri sun in one hand and graham crackers in the other but still\u2728 my only christmas wish would be his health and safety\u2728 and that he never gets kidnapped by fucking nupties\u2728 also, @Fiona, let the child take the front seat he\u2019s been through enough \n\nSNOWBAZ\n\n\u2728 ok so my question now is how in the FUCK am I supposed to live without this ship??\u2728 I know at some point in the future I'm gonna have to get over it but today is not that day. tomorrow wouldn't be either. In fact, come back in sixty years and you would probably still be disappointed\u2728 listen, shipping the (\u0e07\ufe21\u2019-\u2018\ufe20)\u0e07 one with the (\u25e1\u203f\u25e1\u273f) one is the reason I was put on this earth\u2728 no trope fucks me up more than having the obnoxiously smug one of my otp be the one who is actually expertly incapacitated by their crush\u2728 the universe was assembled from nothingness so I could witness the stoic and cool person of my otp (baz) get so flustered when their lover just like, looks in their general direction and just overall be so in love with them that they could cast an incredibly difficult spell that requires true love to work\u2728 also, let's make it clear that the whole-hearted, good-natured and angst-ridden pining filled with lovesick gazing and chest aching and fluttering touches is my literal endgame\u2728 if you ever briefly consider that I will grow bored of the unrequited love trope, the answer is no \u2728 with that being said, can we just fucking appreciate the fact that we didn\u2019t get a slow realization on both sides?? instead we literally got Baz Pitch straight up telling us on his first day back at school that he was hopelessly in love with Simon Snow\u2728 I honest to god read that passage ten times just to make sure my eyes weren't actually betraying me\u2728 also, remember when Baz couldn't believe that agatha and simon broke up because he literally couldn't fathom how anyone would VOLUNTARILY broke up with simon?? he even went out of his way to explain to simon that there was nothing between him and agatha and never has been, all just because he wanted him to be happy even if it physically hurt him to do so??\u2728 I think of that a fucking lot\u2728 but with all seriousness, what the fuck Basilton??\u2728 I mean Baz and Simon were roomates foR EIGHT YEARS. how does that even work?? how do you get the universe to align in your favour like that??\u2728 if I were Baz, I wouldn't waste time playing hard to get!! like, I can talk to a girl for five minutes and already picture our domestic life together let\u2019s get this love train going!!\u2728 it's funny because canonically, Baz was the first one to fall hard and fast but never forget that Simon never shuts the hell up about Baz that Penelope literally forbid him from talking about him unless he \u201cpresents a clear and present danger\u201d and should not take \u201cmore than ten percent of [their] total conversation\u201d\u2728 he spends ninety percent of his productive time thinking about baz, passionately describing Baz's eyes, obsessing over his eating and sleeping habits. like? simon, sweetie, you\u2019re doing a terrible job of pretending to not care about him\u2728 also, can we talk about the fact that Baz was actually about to set himself on fire and didn\u2019t mind it at all because at least his path intertwined with simon long enough for him to have something to miss?? but then the love of his life walked into a burning forest and kissed him and he finally had a reason to live\u2728 the only romantic gesture\u2728 for real though, I'm just really grateful to Snow for walking into that burning forest and being there for baz since I couldn\u2019t do that myself \u2728 and not to be dramatic but whatever chill I still had by that point left my body when Baz called Simon love\u2728 was that really necessary I nearly fucking breathed my kidneys. jesus \u2728 anyway, I hope they're happy and married and living on a mountainside somewhere near the sea and with honeysuckle blossoms blooming almost all year round!! I love them\n\nPENNY\n\n\u2728 oh you mean my baby cinnamon apple cloud muffin sugar plum princess peach angel face doll fairy my world my sun my moon my stars??\u2728 I love Penny and I strive to be as vibrant, as full of love and good vibes that people absorb like warmth from the sun as her\u2728 I hope she's always treated very gently and smells like vanilla and wears only matte dusty rose lipstick\u2728 also her friendship with Simon is the kind of good friendships that are the most healing and light things in the entire world and I love it\n\nAGATHA\n\n\u2728 hmm\u2728 I don\u2019t really like Agatha but we share the same unenthusiasm for any physical activity and I too am always really exhausted for someone who only ever does the bare minimum requirements of getting by so I put up with her, I guess\u2728 I don\u2019t even blame her for running like she did. homegirl just wanted to hang out with her Normal friends, she didn\u2019t sign up for no crazed magicians and deaths. Come on\n\nTHE BLOODY MAGE\n\n\ud83d\udc80 any ideas how to rewrite this book so that he dies in chapter one??\ud83d\udc80 let it be known that I fucking hate him with a casanovian passion and that I hope he's on a rollercoaster that only goes straight down to hell where he belongs\ud83d\udc80 what kind of douche kills an entire nursery of babies??? kills a woman to get her job??

You have to carry on like you will; otherwise, you can\u2019t carry on at all.\u201dThis review contains *spoilers*.This was my first time rereading the whole book instead of just reading the really cute scenes over and over.Fangirl  was one of the very first books that got me into reading Young Adult and because of that Rainbow Rowell will forever hold a special place in my heart.So, of course, when Carry On came out back in October it instantly became one of my all-time favorites\u2014not only because of its place in Fangirl but also because of how good it is.It\u2019s the kind of book (the best kind) that you can\u2019t stop reading and keeps you up all night.This was everything I wanted to read right now; it was adorable, funny, and just the right amount of heartwarming. I love Rainbow Rowell\u2019s writing. There\u2019s just something so special about it that gets me emotional every single time. She can make me cry and laugh and swoon in a single page. And the humor in this book was so well done that I found myself laughing out loud at several times. I really really really love her books (even my mom knows how much I love Rainbow\u2019s writing) .Rainbow Rowell also has this unique way of making her characters seem so real to me. Whenever I read one of her books, I find myself feeling incredibly attached to them. I would be watching a great movie or reading an amazing book and think\u2014 Wow Cath (Fangirl) or Penelope would definitely love this one.I miss Rainbow\u2019s characters every day, even when I tell myself not to. (What I was telling myself while reading.)In Carry On we follow Simon Snow -'The Chosen One'- that\u2019s been destined to save the world from The Insidious Humdrum.\u201cThe Insidious Humdrum is the greatest threat the World of Mages has ever faced. He\u2019s powerful, he\u2019s pervasive. Fighting him is like fighting off sleep when you\u2019re long past the edge of exhaustion.\u201dAnd we start this book in Simon\u2019s point of view, freaking out over Baz\u2019s absence (I was honestly smiling every time Snow mentioned him).I especially loved how Simon was secretly wishing for Baz not to arrive before the start of term (\u201cNobody wants to miss the welcome-back picnic on the Great Lawn tonight. It\u2019s always a big to-do. Games. Fireworks. Spectacle magic. Maybe Baz will miss the picnic; he\u2019s never missed it before, but it\u2019s a nice thought.\u201d) a when Baz actually didn't show up, Simon got really sad and worried. (\u201cI know I should be happy about Baz being gone\u2014it\u2019s what I\u2019ve always said I wanted, to be free of him\u2014but it seems so \u2026 wrong. People don\u2019t just disappear like this.Baz wouldn\u2019t.\u201d)The one scene that definitely had me in tears was when Baz\u2019s mom, Natasha Grimm-Pitch, came from The Veil to tell her son something vital. Reading that part the second time around did not make it any easier.\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhere is my son?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer.\u201cDid you hurt him?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t lie to the dead.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dShe looks over at his empty bed, and her sadness is so potent that in that moment, I\u2019d do anything to get him back for her. (I\u2019d do anything to bring him back.)\u201dSo I was really anticipating for Baz to finally show up\u2014 it\u2019s one of my favorite parts in this book because I adore Simon and Baz together. My cheeks literally hurt from smiling too much.\"When I felt myself slipping too far, I held on to the one thing I\u2019m always sure of\u2014Blue eyes.Bronze curls.The fact that Simon Snow is the most powerful magician alive. That nothing can hurt him, not even me.That Simon Snow is alive.And I\u2019m hopelessly in love with him.\u201dI had to take a moment after I read that because it was incredible. I loved that Rainbow Rowell put Baz\u2019s feelings right out there from the start. I\u2019m rooting for them. We also got to see more of their relationship during Christmas break. I was honestly smiling and freaking out throughout that whole section.No words can describe how much I love Rainbow for writing it so well. I really missed reading about them together.\u201cI lift up his chin. \u201cBaz.\u201d\u201cGo away, Snow.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not a monster,\u201d I say. His face is cold as a corpse in my hand. \u201cI was wrong. All those years. You\u2019re a bully. And a snob. And a complete arsehole. But you\u2019re not one of them.\u201dAnd speaking of freaking out, I almost forgot how sweet Penny and Baz were as friends.It truly warmed my heart because they\u2019re definitely two of my favorite characters and I have tears in my eyes just thinking about them. \u201cSo\u2026,\u201d she says, following him to the chalkboard. \u201cYou got a Visiting. An actual Visiting\u2014Natasha Grimm-Pitch was here.\u201dBaz glances back over his shoulder. \u201cYou sound impressed, Bunce.\u201d\u201cI am,\u201d Penelope says. \u201cYour mother was a hero. She developed a spell for gnomeatic fever. And she was the youngest headmaster in Watford history.\u201dBaz is looking at Penny like they\u2019ve never met.\u201dI love how clever and funny and strong Penny is and I also really appreciated her relationship with her mom. \u201cPenny quotes her mum as much as I quote Penny.\u201d I really care for close families in books.That\u2019s why I\u2019m glad that Baz was (somewhat) close with his Aunt Fiona.Fiona is (of course) vindictive and powerful and honest, and I really enjoyed reading about her.And I loved the way she loved her sister (Baz\u2019s mom). \u201cI told Fiona that I\u2019d go up to the Mage\u2019s office and look around, even if it was pointless. \u201cTake something,\u201d she said, gripping her steering wheel.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a thief,\u201d I said.\u201cIt\u2019s not thieving\u2014that office is hers, it\u2019s yours. Take something for me.\u201d\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I almost always go along with Fiona in the end. The way she misses my mother keeps her alive for me.\u201dOh, and when Penny\u2019s mom, Mitali, mentioned Lucy \u2014whom I had somehow completely forgotten\u2014 all of her history with the Mage came rushing back to me so quickly. It played such an important part in the book for me. I would love it if Rainbow decided to write about their school years. Lucy and Mitali were such intriguing characters in this story.Also, something that completely slipped my notice the first time reading was that Rainbow put a Fangirl reference (of Levi) in this book.\u201cI sit in front of Baz now, on the coffee table\u2014which I carried up by myself. He hands me his cup, and I take a sip. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cPumpkin mocha breve. I created it myself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like drinking a candy bar,\u201d I say.\u201d Here\u2019s the reference from Fangirl:\u201cI haven\u2019t paid yet.\u201dLevi held up his hands. \u201cPlease. You insult me.\u201d\u201cWhat is this?\u201d She leaned over the cup and took a breath.\u201cMy own concoction\u2014Pumpkin Mocha Breve, light on the mocha. Don\u2019t try to order it from anyone else; it\u2019ll never turn out the same.\u201dIt\u2019s been so good visiting this world and Rainbow\u2019s writing again. I can always count on her books to cheer me up.ARC from Netgalley (thank you).*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

This book is perfect.It's everything fanfic-loving adolescent Kristina ever wanted out of a book. It's everything that never would have happened in Harry Potter. It's delicious LGBT+ representative romance, it's sassy writing, it's delightful unbelievable and it took me RIGHT back to my fanfic days.

I mean we\u2019re talking about SIMON AND BAZ!!! BAZ AND SIMON!!! <333OMG!!! I can\u2019t even!!! THEY ARE EVERYTHING AND EVEN MORE!!! XDTheir love reduced me to a babbling and giggling mess and I can\u2019t stop to grin! I\u2019m still grinning like a Cheshire cat and it\u2019s starting to hurt!!! BUT oh god, how much I loved those two!!! There are no words that would do them justice so suffice it to say that I died at least a thousand deaths!! <333 They are too freaking adorable and I want more!! I just want more!!! Rainbow do you hear me?! \nI. WANT. MORE!!!!\n *dies*_________________________________________________________/\\___/\\___/\\___/\\___/\\___/\\___Oh, sorry! Was I out cold again? Anyway!!! =) This book WAS EVERYTHING!BAZ IS EVERYTHING!SIMON IS EVERYTHING! And Baz and Simon GAVE ME LIFE!!! <3333They obviously gave me cardiac arrhythmia too and I think chances are high I\u2019ll never recover!!! Still, I\u2019ll \nnever\n regret that I read this book and it will \nforever\n have a special place in my heart! =)))This said I\u2019m heading straight to the characters section because I\u2019m pretty certain that you all know about the plot by now! ;-) If not: The Insidious Humdrum (Haha! What a name!!!) is threatening to destroy the magical world and Simon Snow isn\u2019t only the most powerful mage of the world but also the only one who seems to be able to stop him. \nOkay, from now on there will be a ton of spoilers and quotes and uncontrolled, incoherent stuttering! If you still want to continue: You\u2019ve been warned!!! ;-P \nSimon:\u201dI don\u2019t know\u201d, he says, closing his eyes. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve never thought much about what I am. I\u2019ve got a lot on my plate.\u201dSimon Snow!!! He\u2019s clumsy, completely oblivious, he doesn\u2019t get anything right and he\u2019s basically a catastrophe walking on two legs! And for some reason that makes him adorable as hell!!! *LOL* Seriously, Simon is like a puppy you just want to cuddle! I can understand why Baz loves him so much and can\u2019t seem to be able to get enough of him! Gosh there were so many moments between those too! It was so funny to see how obsessed Simon was and to read that he had absolutely no clue why he was even so obsessed with Baz! XD I mean Jeez Louise!!! He noticed that Baz looked thinner than usual and that he\u2019s limping and he ran to his house at Christmas just to tell him what he\u2019d found out! Ohh and how he almost lost his mind just because Baz wore jeans!!!!! *LOL* I loved their conversations, because they were always so tender and sweet! Even when they still claimed to be enemies there was always tension in the air!!! <333\u201dI don\u2019t get to choose a plan. I just take it as it comes. And someday, something will catch me unawares or be too big to fight, but I\u2019ll fight anyway.

He\u2019s just a villain.He\u2019s not a villain. He\u2019s just a boy.I\u2019m kissing a boy.I\u2019m kissing Baz.\u201dCHAPTER 61 WAS MY UNDOING!!! I read it 8 times!!! I just couldn\u2019t stop to read it!!! It was so damn sweet!!! What they thought, how they reacted! AREAFDKASDLFASDFKASFDJA!!!! I CAN\u2019T EVEN!!!!\u201dI\u2019m going to die kissing Simon Snow\u2026Simon Snow is going to die kissing me.\u201dBaz:\u201dWhy are you already weeping?\u201d he snarled. \u201cYou\u2019re ruining my plans to push you to tears.\u201dTyrannus Basilton Grimm-Pitch!!! THAT BOY LITERALLY KILLED ME!!! I loved everything about Baz!!! Oh god, I can\u2019t even!!! I\u2019m fangirling so hard here I have to calm down so I can write a proper sentence!!! XD Okay, I think I can write now! I loved how rude he was, how his actions were in stark contrast to everything he thought!!! ARGH!!! AEDKLASDLKFASKD!!! His attitude!!! I mean he really \u201cdared them fucking all\u201d and it was sooo damn amazing to watch!!! XD BUT oh god! His thoughts were so hilarious and tender and I couldn\u2019t get enough of it!!! Baz\u2019s chapters gave me LIFE and I loved each and every single one of them!!! I loved how he noticed that Simon was too thin and how he tried to get him to eat something when they were about to solve the mystery of his mother\u2019s death! I mean he even thought about bringing Simon food, because he knows that he needs it to function properly!!! And he didn\u2019t let him go on Christmas!!! Every single one of Baz\u2019s actions was performed with deliberate care and Simon never realised anything!!! <333 Haha! Oh and that moment when Baz called Simon \u201clove\u201d for the very first time? IT WAS THE DEATH OF ME!!! <333\u201dAnd when I felt myself slipping too far, I held on to the one thing I\u2019m always sure of \u2013 Blue eyes.Bronze curls.The fact that Simon Snow is the most powerful magician alive. That nothing can hurt him, not even me.That Simon Snow is alive.And I\u2019m hopelessly in love with him.\u201d\u201dIt dawned on me during our fifth year. When he followed me around like a dog tied to my ankle. When he wouldn\u2019t give me a single moment of solace to sort through my feelings \u2013 or try to wank them away.\u201d\u201dSharing a room with the person you want most is like sharing a room with an open fire.He\u2019s constantly drawing you in. And you\u2019re constantly stepping too close. And you know it\u2019s not good \u2013 that there is no good \u2013 that there\u2019s absolutely nothing that can ever come of it.But you do it anyway.And then \u2026Well. Then you burn.\u201d\u201dYou were the sun, and I was crashing into you. I\u2019d wake up every morning and think, \u2018This will end in flames.\u2019 \u201cPenny: I was so glad that Simon had her as a friend!! Penelope is amazing and I loved how she bonded with Baz!!! XD Their conversation about his mother was so intriguing and I think their friendship will be awesome! =))) Plus I loved how Penny thought about Simon. Her POV was always so nice to read because she truly cared about him and always wanted his best! She wanted him to be okay, to survive and if it would have been possible she would have even run away with him!! Penny is intelligent, brilliant and blunt and probably the best friend anyone can have! In short: She is amazing and Simon was more than just lucky to have her at his side!!! <333Agatha:\u201dI can\u2019t break up with Simon for a Tory vampire \u2013 my parents would disown me. And I don\u2019t even know what that would entail. Would I have to be evil?\u201dI didn\u2019t like Agatha!!! She was such an egoistic and spoiled brat!!! She was so self-centred; she never even spent a thought about what other people wanted! To read her POV was horrible and the more I read about her, the more I disliked her! How can anyone be so shallow-brained? Plus, she ran away and never even thought about helping her friends!!! What a stupid girl!!!\u201dI wish I were wearing something other than leggings and Ugg boots. I always figured I\u2019d make a more beautiful corpse.\u201dThe Mage:\u201dThe Greatest Mage is our only hope now.But our greatest mage is fundamentally flawed. Cracked. Broken.\u201dThe second character I didn\u2019t like! The mage was so mean! All he wanted to do was to use his son and poor Simon would have done almost everything in order to please him!! I hated how he thought about Simon and I felt really sorry for Lucy! She didn\u2019t deserve to be used like that! =( It makes me sad that Simon never found out who his parents were and I kind of hate Agatha for keeping it a secret! I mean if she would have told them about Lucy and Davy, Simon and the others sooner or later would have figured it out! I\u2019m sure of that!!! But since she was a coward and ran away they never even got a chance to think about it!All told, I really loved this book and I never ever wanted it to end! I swear I\u2019m going to buy a physical copy of \u201cCarry On\u201d and then I\u2019ll take it to my bed and cuddle it until I fall asleep!!! *LOL* Yes, that\u2019s how much I loved it!!! <333So if you want some fluff in your life, if you want to grin like a Cheshire cat and if you want to laugh out loud while sitting in a train: READ THIS BOOK!!! You won\u2019t regret it! ;-P\u201dWhat you are is a fucking tragedy, Simon Snow. You literally couldn\u2019t be a bigger mess.\u201dHe tries to kiss me, but I hold back \u2013 \u201cAnd you like that?\u201d\u201cI love it,\u201d he says.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause we match.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Lindsey Rey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5436213-lindsey-rey", "userReview": "One word: BRILLIANT."}, {"userName": "wesley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36179338-wesley", "userReview": "I\u2019ve loved Fangirl, especially the excerpts from Cath\u2019s fanfics featuring Simon and Baz. But this! This is just a whole new level of intense. And if the above will not make you die of extreme sweetness, I don\u2019t know what will.You might have observed as well that the quotes above are all from Baz\u2019s POV. It doesn\u2019t mean that Simon didn\u2019t have his moments (because he most certainly did!), but I\u2019ve always imagined Baz to be a snobbish, condescending prick when I\u2019d get to finally hear his voice. Well, he was most of the time but I wasn\u2019t expecting the endless pining and the secret crushing over Simon Snow.But then again, who wouldn\u2019t fall in love with Simon? He\u2019s just this ray of light \u2013 na\u00efve but brave and bold and selfless. Most of the time, he\u2019s reckless but you wouldn\u2019t be able to hold it against him because he wears his heart on his sleeve. It makes you want to protect him even though he\u2019s doing all the actual saving.Yet to Simon, Baz is this immaculate, flawless, and well-mannered guy who is everything he isn\u2019t. Handsome, smart, and cool, Simon thinks Baz always gets what he wants. For so long, he hated the guy because he symbolizes everything that he won\u2019t ever be, and well, Baz has been taunting and scheming against him time and again. But in actuality for Baz, it\u2019s a defense mechanism for a love that will never be his.Factor in that they both represent opposite sides in the war of the mages \u2013 Simon as The Mage\u2019s heir calling for reforms and equality, and Baz as the last living heir of the Pitches, the most influential name in the Old Families, who believe in tradition and power being given to the few elites. They\u2019ve been doing this exhausting keep-your-enemies-closer dance for so long. For the good first part of the book, it\u2019s messy and intriguing. Suspenseful. Rowell keeping you on your toes and building the story up towards something.And when you finally think you\u2019re at your wits' end, the dam breaks with that scorching first kiss. Then everything just explodes. Revelation after countless revelation. Rowell was relentless. And it was exhilarating and beautiful. Simon and Baz\u2019s relationship turning to something more. Rowell bombarding you with all these new twists to the plot. And it just works well with the entire story. It\u2019s like when a talented opera singer works with the best orchestra \u2013 creating this hair raising symphony of melody that is pleasing to your ears. Everything is in perfect harmony. And it\u2019s exactly like that with how Rainbow Rowell gave direction to this book. The micro and macro side of things in the story working together towards one solid goal.And that is to provide us readers with an epic adventure full of love and magic that leaves you feeling like an oxymoron \u2013 utterly exhausted but pleasantly contented.I am contented! I mean, I was. And well, I know the photo above says to keep my cool and carry on. But God, I wish there were more. Not only of the story but more books such as this. As an LGBT reviewer, I am more than happy that Rowell was able to penetrate the mainstream community with gay characters like Simon and Baz. I know that there have been successful attempts by several authors, but not to this extent. And I\u2019m hoping this helps in paving the way for more LGBT books being accepted in the mainstream, so that in the near future, there won\u2019t ever be adjectives placed before the word \u2018book\u2019 or \u2018novel\u2019.Well-done!

'Til this week. Had one of the worst weeks ever and now this. I started reading when I was six. Well, everybody here did, but what I meant is: after they taught me how to read I kept reading. I never stopped. Sure, there were years in which I read less (middle school. Worst period of my life.) and years in which it seems like the only thing I could say was \"more books.\", but I never stopped. And well, by now I can usually tell, after 50-100 pages, whether I'll like the book I'm reading or not. In this case I didn't need 100 pages, because I knew after chapter 3 that Carry On was doomed for me. But, as I (almost) always do, I carried on AH. kept reading.This is how it went. Warning: it's bad. Like, really bad.> You don't spell \"Magic\" like \"Magick\". You can, but please, don't. It's ridiculous. > The Harry Potter references started to get on my nerves after the first 2 chapters. And actually, I wasn't even finished with chapter 2. \"Like in our sixth year, when he practically ignored me. Every time I tried to talk to him, he told me he was in the middle of something important.\"Duh. That's Order of the phoenix. \"I don\u2019t know what Penny\u2019s even worried about; she\u2019s had a boyfriend in America since our fourth year. (He was an exchange student at Watford.) Micah plays baseball, and he has a face so symmetrical, you could summon a demon on it.\"And American Victor Krum.\"I started helping out Ebb the goatherd during my second year at Watford. And for a while, hanging out with the goats was pretty much my favourite thing. (Which Baz had a field day with.) Ebb\u2019s the nicest person at Watford.\"Female Hagrid here.And Simon following Baz around...oh, look, it's like sixth year, when Harry was obsessed with Draco! Ooooh.I know there are so many people who were able to ignore all the HP references and similarities, but I'm not like that. If you write:\"Why did I have to fight the Humdrum? The Mage has answered that question a dozen different ways over the years: Because I was chosen. Because I was prophesied. Because the Humdrum won\u2019t leave me alone. But none of those are real answers. Penelope has given me the only answer that I know what to do with. . . . \u201cBecause you can, Simon. And someone has to.\u201d\"I'll just tell you that this doesn't feel like a book at all. > The spells. Were they supposed to be fun?\"He steps away from me. \u201cSimon,\u201d he says. His wand is out. \u201cStay cool!\u201d I fumble for my own wand and start running through spells. \u201cKeep it together! Suck it up! Steady on! Hold fast!\u201d\"My reaction: .______________________________.\"Down in the winding tunnels of the Catacombs, I use every revealing spell I know, and every finding spell. (\u201cCome out, come out, wherever you are! It\u2019s show time! Scooby-DoobyDoo, where are you!\u201d)\"Are you serious? If it's a comedy, well, it isn't funny. At some point Simon uses this spell: \"It is what it is!\". I'll tell you what it is: the crappiest magic system ever. > The book lacked balance in terms of pace. The first half was so slow I wanted to DNF it so so so badly. > Simon is pretty plain. I just...didn't click with him. Actually none of the characters truly did it for me. Penelope was supposed to be the Hermione of the group, but she really wasn't able to shine in my opinion. Agatha was just silly, easy.> The plot...give me a minute so I can look for it. Seriously, it was...flimsy. Predictable at best to be honest. > Romance! Uhm. I thought Simon/Baz had a lot of potential ship-wise, but...they didn't give me any feels to be honest. I liked Baz (he's actually the only thing I liked in the whole book.) but I didn't feel any chemistry there. I didn't like how silly Simon's character development was. Like, it was clear that his relationship with Agatha was doomed (come on, it was so ridiculous) but sadly his first move towards Baz felt very anticlimatic to me. I mean, he kissed Baz and that was it. There's not any character development when it comes to Simon's sexuality or personal growth and he didn't even think much about his relationship with Baz. It didn't feel natural to me.Is there anything I actually liked? Baz. I'm not fangirling over him, but he was like, the only character that seemed an original character and not just a poor copy of the original ones. Please please tell me this book is the result of a riddikulus spell. It would be acceptable then. So, listen, lots of people loved Carry On, but I didn't, couldn't and barely managed to tolerate it. When I heard that Rainbow Rowell would publish this I was so so freaking excited, you have no idea. I even wrote a pre-review with cute Legend of Korra gifs (and that says something) but as time passed I realised that I liked the idea of it more than anything. This is my opinion, and I don't want to offend anyone, but to me Carry on felt like a bad joke. One of those jokes that are supposed to make you laugh but make you cringe instead. It gave me this fanfction vibe that I couldn't shake off. And I'm sorry, but I've read better fanfictions.I love fantasy and I feel like this is kind of insulting for the genre. And if it was meant to be a parody it was even worse because...I'm not laughing. Please Rainbow, stick with comtemporary novels.

It seems that for some readers those comparisons stopped after a while, but it was constantly in the back of my mind. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it because of the HP similarities - I actually quite like what was taken from the wizarding world, and I enjoyed seeing how some things were turned on its head.

However, I think I just couldn't get fully drawn into this story with my mind so switched on about Harry Potter - I just wasn't able to fully immerse myself in the world and connect with the characters as they are (by this I mean thinking of Baz as Baz, rather than constantly think Baz=Draco).Also, I'm so here for Baz & Simon <3"}, {"userName": "Chantal  (Every Word A Doorway)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31668723-chantal-every-word-a-doorway", "userReview": "[The mage\u2019s backstory was fascinating!

I admit! I was skeptical! Because I really hate Harry Potter rip-offs usually (like The Iron Trial soooo didn't work for me) and I was also curious to see how Rainbow Rowell would pull of a fantasy book when she's famous for her contemporaries. Well guess what?! I FREAKING LOVED IT. I started off moody and then ended shrieking and turning pages so fast I nearly ended up with the book in my mouth. It is delicious. I am just sayin'.So OBVIOUSLY I need a list. But I'll get the growls out of the way first.THINGS I AM NOT A FAN OF:\u2022 This started off as a...I'm going to say it...Harry Potter rip off. Seriously, it wasn't even trying that hard to be different. But by the end it was 100% different and unique and clever and fresh. So why was the beginning so cliche? The similarities to Harry Potter make me very uncomfortable because, while I think fanfic is fine, I don't really believe in it being published when it still resembles the original so much? Ahem. \u2022 It was really long. Reeeeeeally looooooong. The first 1/3 was a bit boring, dare I say.\u2022 I thought the magic system of spells was...lame. Like they cast spells with \"normal\" phrases? So saying \"some like it hot!\" is a spell or whatnot and it was just lame to me.\u2022 It had a LOT of backstory which was just info-dumped because, obviously, this is a standalone and we don't see Simon's first 7 years of magic school. So basically this infamous \"war\" and \"hatred\" between him and Baz is ONLY TOLD NOT SHOWN. It made it less powerful.\u2022 It was narrated by a heck of a lot of people. Mostly Simon, but also Baz, Penelope, Agatha and this girl Lucy who didn't fit in the story AT ALL until veeery late in the book. Ergo Lucy's chapters were confusing and boring. My real quibble here was that the chapters were in 1st person AND short. So all the constant head-bopping often had me confused as to whose POV I was in. Cue head exploding.\u2022 I hated Agatha, FYI.\u2022 I have a lot of problems with this book...AS YOU CAN SEE. And yet I'm giving it 4-stars?! CURSE YOU BOOK FOR TWISTING MY eMOTIONS LIKE THIS. (This is actually a good thing. Idek why I'm complaining.)...ahem. But now we can talk about the things I loved. BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF LOVE RIGHT NOW AND I WANNA EXPLODE.THINGS I LOVED AN AWFUL LOT:\u2022 One thing I noticed very much was how easily and comfortably Rainbow Rowell wrote it with a British flair! I just read another book by an American author trying to incorporate British culture and -- ugh. It was awful. But this?! This had slang (though not a lot) and mannerisms and it just felt QUITE BRITISH THANK YOU. (Of course I'm an Aussie, so I can't vouch for its perfectness...but it worked for me.)\u2022 The characters. AFJDSALKD THESE ADORABLE WONDERFUL CHARACTERS. I CAN'T EVEN RIGHT NOW. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. They were nothing like the Harry Potter characters. NOTHING. Which just pleased me a lot of a lot. I couldn't get enough of Simon's gaunt stammering quiet self or Baz's suave, snappy, fiery temper. The characters leapt off the page with their realness and relatabilty. \u2022 And also Penelope. She was kind of nerdy, a bit bossy, totally factual and the best friend a person could ask for. I want her for a best friend. Here is my order, please and thank you.\u2022 Also Simon Snow and Tyrannus Basilton Grimm-Pitch. Do you know how much I love their names? I LOVE THEM. #SnowBaz\u2022 Speaking of how much I ship them. Omg. I will sail this ship till dawn I tell, you folks. It is ADORABLE. They hate each other, but Baz is the first to admit how much he actually loves Simon. But he hates that he loves him. And then Simon...and then...afjdkasld just their interactions and the chemistry and they're like fire and splinters. \u2022 And somehow the romance wasn't EVER irritating or too angsty?! Which happens a lot with these I-hate-you-I-love-you romances. But not here. It was perfect. It was just the right amount of snark and hesitation and Rainbow Rowell writes a damn fine kissing scene, I must say.\u2022 *whispers* I ship it so much.\u2022 The writing was really addictive. At first I felt like I was slogging through WAY too much info-dumpy backstory...but after that? After about the 30% mark? I couldn't put it down and I didn't WANT to because it was so beautifully written. \u2022 And after the initial Harry-Potter-setting-up-world...it got really ORIGINAL. And totally deviated onto this story about finding Baz's mother's killer...instead of killing a Voldemort sort of character. Consider me surprised. But the fact that it WAS so original and exciting and feelsy makes me ask -- WHY THE HECK WASN'T IT LIKE THAT FROM THE START????? HMMM???? A little more effort and the book wouldn't even have reeked of HP at all.\u2022 I loved the ending. <3\u2022 I love how quotable it is.\u2022 I love it, dangit. I LOVE IT....Clearly this is one of my rational and logical reviews (hahaha not) but, zomg, I am just surprised at myself. I really thought this'd be a downer for me. BUT NOPE. I have my twitches, but overall this book is one I want to hug and cherish and perhaps reread someday because IT IS THAT ADORABLE. One of my new favourite OTPs of ever I think.Ohhhh, but I have to admit: the cover is kinda sucky. Sorry. It is.AND I GOTTA SAY ONE THING TOO: Is Carry On the story that Gemma T. Leslie wrote in Fangirl? OR is Carry On the story Cath was writing? So is this like fanfic written by a fictional character?!? I mean, it doesn't matter. But I want to know if this is Cath's version or Gemma T Leslie's. That is all. But the fact that this is a book from inside a book just makes me LOVE Rainbow Rowell even more. EPIC, OKAY?! EPIC. <3*** QUOTES:\"There are only so many hours in a day, Simon.

Never thought I'd DNF a Rainbow Rowell novel. It was my 2nd attempt and as much as I wanted to love it, since I've adored her other books, it just wasn't for me.I couldn't have cared less about the characters or storyline. It felt a bit all over the place, like reading the last instalment in a series. And though we were told certain aspects and events that occurred previously, it felt rushed and flimsy. There was no space for it to properly develop. It was just thrown in there, hence I felt no attachment to any of it. It was like reading Harry Potter fan fiction (and not a good one). And it would've been fine if this was meant to be fan fiction. But it's a fully-fledged novel and it honestly didn't read like one. The characters were carbon copies of the Potter world, they fell extremely flat, the plot had no structure. No originality. It was so frustrating to read. Everything that I loved about Rainbow Rowell's books (i.e. writing, characters) was missing.

The world could have used a bit more development, there were some plot lines that deserved a little bit more attention, and it's pretty meta, so if that isn't your thing, you may have a tough time with this.ButThis is genuinely one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. I cried, I laughed, I texted my friend screaming in all caps, I cried again. Carry On is Rainbow Rowell's take on the \"chosen one\" trope, and I think she tackled it brilliantly! It was clever and witty and down right hilarious. This book was not what I expected in the best way possible.If you're anything like me and prefer character based novels over plot based ones, I think you'd enjoy this, because this book is all about the characters. Every single character is funny, three dimensional, and flawed, and I love them ALL (don't even get me started on my love for Baz because I'll never stop). There were so many fantastic relationships between the characters, but above all else, I LOVED the romance. The romance tore my heart to pieces, and I don't think I'll ever recover, but it was absolutely perfect. Also:I never thought I'd say this after Twilight, but this book actually made me like vampires again.I just loved it.

If I think about it more I may end up moving it up.SO MANY FEELS SO MANY.Honestly this was so fantastic. It perfectly blended the magical elements with the romance elements (if u didn't know....LGBTQ REPRESENTATION WHAT WHAT I see u Simon and Baz) and didn't feel like it was trying too hard EVER.I loved the magic system and how different it was and also the characters and just AHHH.

When I was reading Fangirl I couldn't have cared less about Simon and Baz. For me they were merely a quirky Harry Potter parody and a plot device to develop Cath and Levi's relationship.This was the mindset that I had while going into this book. Initially I noticed that the book didn't take itself too seriously and it KNEW not to take itself to seriously. You gotta love Rainbow for that.In the beginning I couldn't help but draw parallels to Harry Potter, but at some point I stopped thinking about Simon as \"Harry\" or Baz as \"Draco\" or Watford as \"Hogwarts\", but they became just Simon, Baz and Watford. The story gained a life of it's own - pretending to be the epic finale to an epic book series; all packaged in this wonderful standalone novel. I got invested in the story, in the characters, in the little quirks of an otherwise conventional magical world, in the MYSTERY, IN THE RELATIONSHIP. I can totally relate why Cath ships Simon and Baz!All in all I'm amazed how Rainbow Rowell managed to pull this off. This could've gone terribly wrong in so many ways. I'm glad it didn't, I'm glad I read this. The author doesn't cease to amaze me!"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12842423-jessica", "userReview": "4.5 starsRainbow can apparently write anything! It's clear reading Carry On that Rainbow is really really talented with creating these characters and making them feel so real (and she even admitted at the Carry On book event her stories start with her characters then later the plot and everything else develops.) I LOVE Simon and Baz <3 I wish she was planning on writing more about them in the future!They were my favorite part of the book!I also liked how this felt like its own story. After reading Fangirl I was wondering if this would feel too similar to Harry Potter but it didn't have that problem. While this was different than other fantasy books I've read as far as how she develops the world building and stuff, It was still amazing. For the most part, I did like how she would switch back and forth between characters so we got to read what everyone was thinking. However, during the fight scenes I just wanted to know more about what was happening and maybe not exactly what they were thinking? Does that make sense? For the rest of the book it was perfect. I just kind of noticed this during intense fight scenes. I would have liked to know more about Lucy, the Mage, Ebb etc I almost feel like the parts about Lucy and Davy growing up weren't enough and I want to know more about them. Why was Davy so obsessed with the Great Mage? I started reading the book and lightly compared him to Harry Potter's Dumbledore in my mind very early on and I realized he wasn't like him at all. He was entirely his own character with lots of his own demons for sure. Why did Simon's mom call him \"rosebud\" just like Baz's mother. Purely coincidental? Where is Lucy? Did she die? Or is she out in California somewhere like Agatha said... From the way she talked it's hard to believe she would leave Simon behind....Overall I still feel satisfied with how the book ended. (Definitely wouldn't complain if there were more Simon Snow books though *crosses fingers Rainbow will change her mind about this being a standalone*)."}, {"userName": "Tehanu", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3942101-tehanu", "userReview": "So this will basically be a Drarry fanfic, right?Nevermind, It's Rainbow so I'll read it!"}], "description": "Simon Snow is the worst chosen one who\u2019s ever been chosen.That\u2019s what his roommate, Baz, says.
