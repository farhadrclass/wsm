The aim of this book is to investigate the President's psychological motivations and further understand his contradictory and divided nature.It would be easy to assume that Nixon was misunderstood, that there would be some secret which would explain his grand, self-destructive, or confusing actions. Take, for example, the contention that he was a progressive Republican. Perhaps to us he appears like that, but then he was a pragmatist. As such, he appears far to the left of many modern-day Republicans - partly because of his idea to cooperate with a Democratic-held Congress where he spent most time on foreign affairs.But this book focuses more on Nixon's personality. One characteristic is his incredible awkwardness, like Jeb Bush today. He once rushed to aid a policeman in his motorcade who fell off his motorcycle, helped him up, and asked him 'Do you like your job?' without any hint of joking. When he wanted to have a drink with Walter Cronkite, he made himself a 'double sherry', to make himself appear as an everyman. He was not so good at social interaction, but he had a keen and sharpened talent for observation. It was tough to make the American people love him, but he knew about their needs and fears. I quote, \"People react to fear, not love; they don't teach that in Sunday school, but it's true.\"But unlike the beleaguered Jeb, Nixon thrived off of conflict. He rushed towards crowds, made big plans. That was the image he wanted for himself. He wanted to be a detached leader, a true statesman, a warrior, Churchillian. He wanted to never cry, and he told his staff he never did, but he often did. Avoiding self-examination, or self-realization. The final thesis is grand and obvious. Nixon was a man of contradictions? Well of course he is. He's a human being. Because of his taped conversations, we know more about his human side than other political leaders, and his biggest mistake lends his presidency the air of a tragedy. It is a stimulating exercise and a tempting topic to search further, but any attempts to psychoanalyze the dead will always be found wanting. The book goes in fits and starts from topic to topic, and some of the information here is not so original. But it is a quick and sometimes informative read, where you would think all of importance had been uncovered."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7746155-jason", "userReview": "At times I've wished that I could be a college professor. I would teach a course entitled \"The Psyche of Richard Nixon.\" \"A serial collector of resentements,\" is how I've heard Nixon described by a biographer. I couldn't agree more. This is the first biography of this man that actually attempted to delve into his mind, as tortured as it was. Of course, the section on the Presidency takes up the most space in this book (twenty chapters) but the author does go back to the origins of this complicated man. For as much as he does, I would have liked to have seen much more information/exposition on Nixon's formative years and early career in politics. Without missing a beat the Watergate scandal is dissected at length. For as interesting as it was (I felt it was the best section of the book) it's my opinion that the author described the plottings and machinations of a man unraveling before his subordinates' eyes quite well. In all of the descriptions that I've read on the Watergate scandal, Thomas' version is possibly one of the best. He pulls no punches, describing it in a pure, simple nuts and bolts fashion. Overall, I found this to be a very good read. Sure, parts of it could have written better, but this author is one of my favorites and I greatly admire his style of writing.ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN 2015."}, {"userName": "Jen Crichton", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6270527-jen-crichton", "userReview": "Having been raised in a liberal household full of Nixon-haters, I found it embarrassing at first to realize how much I empathized with Nixon at the start of his political career. I recognized Nixon's strengths as admirable and felt for him as he wrestled with shyness and social exclusion. An older friend had told me he had voted for Nixon over Kennedy in 1960. Thomas's book shows me for the first time how Nixon could make such a choice viable. Evan Thomas does a great job of showing how after winning the presidency, Nixon's personal weaknesses created a vicious cycle of isolation and paranoia with the ultimate tragic mistake of not viewing those actions from a national and historic perspective. The balance of detail and narrative and interpretation is just right. Readable and insightful, BEING NIXON has helped me better understand the political world I grew up in and whose legacy we are living with today, and the complex, emotionally unstable figure at the heart of so many of its most turbulent moments."}, {"userName": "Jim Cullison", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6887728-jim-cullison", "userReview": "Evan Thomas has achieved the seemingly impossible by crafting this highly entertaining, informative, insightful, and balanced biography of our 37th president.

Thomas was a writer and editor for over three decades at Newsweek and Time Magazine and served as visiting professor at Harvard and Princeton. He is the author of nine books including \u201cIke\u2019s Bluff: President Eisenhower\u2019s Secret Battle to Save the World\u201d which I read and enjoyed.This ostensibly comprehensive, full-length biography is the product of significant research and is consistently fluent, fluid and eminently readable. And it proves far more balanced than I expected given its reputation for being too sympathetic to Nixon.One question which proves difficult to unravel is whether this book intends to serve as a biography or a character study. During its early pages it feels firmly like the latter \u2013 exploring Nixon\u2019s thoughts and actions and analyzing his personality. As the narrative approaches his presidency, though, it seems to morph into a biography. But it never seems fully devoted to either cause.As a result, while it is consistently interesting and thought-provoking, \u201cBeing Nixon\u201d reads like a collection of engaging short-stories that hold together somewhat loosely \u2013 many with a \u201cpsychoanalytical\u201d feel and others which convey serious history (fortunately from an approachable, rather than painfully pedantic, perspective).Nixon\u2019s pre-presidency receives about one-third of the book\u2019s 531 pages. These fifty-six years fly by far too quickly and many moments are covered with little or no depth. Readers hoping to learn much about Nixon\u2019s House, Senate or Vice Presidential years, for instance, will be disappointed, and his unsuccessful 1960 presidential campaign fails to receive the penetrating coverage it deserves.Nixon\u2019s five-and-a-half years in the White House are reviewed with more intensity although this portion of the book never feels like a particularly serious survey of his presidency. Instead, these twenty chapters provide a steady stream of fascinating anecdotes, quips, stories and revelations that capture the reader\u2019s attention but never completely satisfy. And because Thomas tends to bounce quickly from topic to topic, discussions frequently feel unfinished or disappointingly perfunctory.Readers familiar with the basics of Nixon\u2019s life will find much of this book valuable. Several events such as Nixon\u2019s early morning presidential pilgrimage to the Lincoln Memorial, his relationship with Henry Kissinger and his interaction with his family are particularly revealing.And despite most historians\u2019 disdain for psycho-biography, Thomas\u2019s exploration of Nixon\u2019s psyche and mental motivations is keenly perceptive, at best, and thought-provoking at the very least. In addition, this book\u2019s fluent, extremely readable style makes it a far easier read than its length would suggest. Finally, while I generally find \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d sections an after-thought, Thomas\u2019s proves uncommonly substantive.Overall, Evan Thomas\u2019s \u201cBeing Nixon: A Man Divided\u201d is neither a traditional biography nor a dedicated character study. Instead, it is a well-written, well-researched review of Nixon\u2019s life with an emphasis on his personality and motives. While not an ideal introduction to the 37th president, it provides broad (if not uniformly deep) historical coverage and is most rewarding as a supplementary book for anyone interested in seeing this tragic figure from a unique perspective.Overall rating: 3 1/2 stars"}, {"userName": "Phillip W.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22561503-phillip-w", "userReview": "The fairest and most non-ideological portrait of Richard Nixon to date. This volume doesn't attempt to be comprehensive. The goal of this book is to insightful. And it is. Evan Thomas is scrupulously fair and has labored mightily to get below the skin of a man famously averse.

As he did to perfection with his study of Bobby Kennedy, he links together anecdotes to form a most enthralling and insightful portrait of Richard Nixon. In adding to the vast literature on the 37th President, Thomas offers a balanced and compelling look into both Nixon\u2019s personal and political lives. The book left me feeling a range of emotions: from uplifted and inspired, to disgusted and ashamed. Thomas shows how Nixon was a brilliant activist, courageous peacemaker, and savvy visionary. However, his extreme shyness, endless insecurities, and incessant need for approval left him struggling with conflicted instincts on how to handle his enemies, both real and perceived. In devising ways to undermine his opponents, he allowed a toxic environment to develop and run unchecked around him, which ultimately cost him the presidency. But, as a world leader, he possessed unparalleled optimism, spirited energy, and a belief in idealism. The indelible image Thomas leaves me with is that Nixon was a true fighter, always resilient in his ability to bounce back. Nonetheless, he made a number of foolish mistakes in how he chose to carry out his battles. It is always a pleasure to read Evan Thomas\u2019s work. The grace and precision of his language is nothing short of poetical."}, {"userName": "Joshua Rigsby", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12022033-joshua-rigsby", "userReview": "Such a fascinating person. Thomas's work is to reexamine the popular 'tricky dick' image of Nixon, and offer counter examples from Nixon's personal life, his own writing, and anecdotes from people who knew him personally. This necessarily leads to the book feeling fairly subjective, and at times, overwhelmingly so. It is difficult to countermand the anti-Semitic views that Nixon himself expresses on the infamous tapes, for example. But in other places we see how the ex-president's hard-scrabble lower middle class background, a gut-punching lifetime of rejections, and a sometimes-deserved defensive cloak of paranoia led this man to act in ways that made sense to him. This book doesn't so much rehabilitate Nixon's image, as diagnose it. Definitely, a must-read for anyone interested in the president, or who, like myself, hails from his hometown of Whittier, California. http://joshuarigsby.com"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/775366-jim", "userReview": "Fascinating but sparse on detail, this biography of the 37th president hits the high (and low) spots of Nixon's controversial career without dallying overlong on any of the nuts and bolts that underpinned that career. Thomas writes very well, and there are both fresh and familiar insights into Nixon and his personal life and demons. But in the end, there is not enough deep analysis or explication to give one a sense of what being Richard Nixon, or being with him, was really like. This is the 37th presidential biography I have read, and I admit I expected an overabundance of detail, so rich and intricate is the story of Nixon and so extraordinarily well-documented his life. Instead, I found myself far too often wondering how something played out, what went on in the days and minutes and not just the months and years. The Watergate scandal receives the best of the detail, and I understood it more clearly after reading the book. But of the 37 presidents I've read books on thus far, this is the first to make me think maybe I need to read a second book on one."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2350206-kate", "userReview": "Well, wow. This was a surprisingly wonderful read!I am not a politically-minded person but I will admit to having a certain fascination with the Watergate story-- probably because I am an ethically-minded person, and those events are a classic unraveling of comeuppance for wrongdoing. Naturally, Nixon to me has long been the national bogeyman.But now, Evan Thomas' well-documented, gracefully written work has shown me what it was like to experience the Nixon era from Nixon's point of view. Without sparing well-deserved criticism, Thomas convincingly shows us a politician who had strengths and good intentions as well as mockable character flaws. A human being! with whom I could actually sympathize. I learned a lot about Nixon and politics from this book, and I may even have learned something of general value about assessing the overt behavior of well-publicized individuals. They seem utterly knowable because their actions are wellpublicized, but the complete story may not be immediately evident.(I'm still not sorry that I never voted for Nixon-- but now I know that he was less powerful and more pitiable than i ever would have supposed.)"}, {"userName": "Jim Cooper", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15242838-jim-cooper", "userReview": "Colson, Dean, Haldeman, Mitchell, Hunt - I've grown up hearing those names. I had a vague idea of what Watergate was. But until I read this book, I never really had the whole story. Evan Thomas does an excellent job showing you exactly how - and why - it all happened.I wouldn't really call this a biography. It does go from his birth to his death, but there are a lot of parts that don't get a lot of coverage - Nixon and Khrushchev, Nixon vs. Kennedy, Nixon as VP, all of them are covered but not in depth. The White House years cover the majority of the book.At first that bothered me, until I realized what Thomas was trying to do. Everybody hears the story of Watergate and says \"How could this disaster have happened?\" Thomas' goal is to walk you through his life, illuminating the events and relationships and eccentricities and paranoia that made Nixon who he was. That way, when you finally do get to Watergate, you think to yourself - \"Of course a disaster happened!\" Once you get inside Nixon's head and see everything through the lens of who he really was and why he was surrounded by the people he was, disaster seems like the only possible endgame.The most interesting part of all is that Thomas does all that and you still end up liking Nixon! Or at least you feel for him. At least one of his paranoias was based in fact - the media had it out for him and was completely biased against him from the very beginning.Very interesting and enlightening (at least for me) book."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2242482-david", "userReview": "Reading about Nixon, it\u2019s so hard not to think of Trump.

Instead, his aim is to understand Nixon as a person or, as he puts it, \u201cto understand what it was like to actually be Nixon.\u201d The book is very well written in a style that makes it accessible to the general reader. It's a linear biography that follows its subject from birth to death, and is well balanced in that the bulk of it concentrates on Nixon's political career, with just enough of the before and after to shed light on Nixon's character.Thomas shows the child Nixon as a high achiever at school, despite being naturally shy. His background was one of hardship, though not poverty, which prevented him from attending one of the Ivy League colleges. This meant that after graduation he wasn't able to get into the top law firms, and Thomas suggests that this left him with a lifelong chip on his shoulder, always declaring he wouldn't have Ivy League graduates working for him, though in fact he put many of them into top jobs. This small example in itself shows a trait that is repeated again and again throughout his life \u2013 a disconnect between what he said and how he acted. Even at this young age, Nixon is shown as pompous and humourless, and something of a loner. Despite his Quaker background, when America entered WW2 he joined the Army, though he was never directly involved in the fighting. His introduction to political campaigning came after the war when he was invited to stand for Congress in California. Dirty tricks were rife and accepted as pretty much the norm by all sides. Again this is something Thomas emphasises all the way through, that dirty campaigns were not unusual and that each side expected the other side to be as devious as they were. In recounting Nixon's pre-Presidential political career, Thomas highlights most those features that he feels shed some light on Nixon's personality, character and political beliefs. Politically, even at this early stage Nixon's interests lay more in foreign than domestic affairs. He made his name by going after Alger Hiss on behalf of the House Un-American Activities Committee, refusing to give up until he achieved success. Thomas suggests this experience was important in forming Nixon's approach to politics in general \u2013 at times when he faced difficulties he often referred back to the Hiss affair as a way of insisting that his tactics were the way to get results. He also served on the committee that pushed through the Marshall Plan and was genuinely fearful of the communist threat to a destroyed and poverty-ridden Europe. Later, when serving as Vice-President, Eisenhower would use him as a kind of travelling diplomat, in which role he had some significant successes. At home, he was used as Ike's attack dog against his political opponents. Reviled by the Press and despised by the social and political elite because, Thomas suggests, of his comparatively humble background and lack of social savoir-faire, Nixon nonetheless had the common touch, and when Ike considered dropping him as running mate in '56, it was popular pressure that kept him on the ticket. In the '60 election, Thomas suggests that the Kennedy camp ran a huge dirty tricks campaign, pretty much buying JFK's way in to the Presidency with blatant bribes and backhanders. I have no way of knowing how accurate that is, but given that underhand and devious methods seem to have been the norm on both sides, it doesn't sound unbelievable. However at this point for the first time Thomas gave me the impression that he was being too soft on Nixon, building excuses for his later behaviour. He suggests Nixon vowed after this never to be beaten in the matter of dirty tricks again.Once the book reaches the stage of Nixon's Presidency, Thomas provides a believable picture of a rather isolated President, not personally close even to the people who worked most directly with him. The concentration on Nixon's personality leaves the book a little light on actual policy matters, I felt, assuming a familiarity with events that some non-American readers and even perhaps younger US readers might not have. But I thought Thomas gave a really good picture of the social unrest of the late '60s and of how Nixon reacted to the ongoing questions of race, social liberalisation and, of course, Vietnam. Thomas delves into the background and events of Watergate in some detail, and I was left with the impression that it was a combination of paranoia and the belief that as President he was untouchable that led Nixon to become so heavily implicated. He also is shown to have had a kind of mistaken loyalty, or perhaps it was just weakness, that prevented him from getting rid of people as they fell under suspicion. Though he was clearly responsible for setting the tone that led to the prevalence of dirty tricks within his office, he probably wasn't aware of the actual Watergate affair in advance, so could probably have escaped the worst of the scandal had he been more decisive and brutal about sacking people at an earlier stage.Thomas finishes with a look at Nixon's life after the Presidency, when he gradually became a kind of elder statesman, giving advice to a succession of Presidents. If Thomas' portrayal is accurate, then it all seems like a rather sad waste of a man who clearly had great talent and intellect, but whose personality weaknesses took him along a path that led to his own downfall. If there was really as much corruption in politics as Thomas suggests, then one can't help feeling that Nixon was merely the one who got caught. Though it seemed that just occasionally Thomas went a little easy on him, I felt overall that this was a fairly balanced account and certainly provided a credible portrait of Nixon's complex character.

I purchased two, this one as well as the book by Tim Weiner.I thought this was a very fair portrait of a very complicated man. This is a story of an intelligent man, hampered and overly enveloped by his insecurities. He let those insecurities define him. I'm a liberal, and it was sad for me to read about a \"conservative\" who pushed through some hallmark legislation, including the Clean Air Act and the creation of the EPA (ok, some of it was guided by politics.) it's amazing to me that a man so insecure could rise to the Presidency. It's sad that he allowed himself to be surrounded by individuals who took advantage of the man, and contributed to his downfall. I think what I ultimately learned is that we will never really know the man. He will remain one of histories most enigmatic figures.

We were put in small groups and told to pick from a list of names. Of course, my group had to pick last, so by then, all the Presidents we recognized were gone. We picked Richard Nixon on a whim. We also quickly realized that we were really in over our heads trying to explain Watergate and impeachment. In fact, we never quite figured out what it was. Questioning adults about it didn't yield any better information. My solution to this problem was that we just cram as many trivia facts into our project as possible and then conclude abruptly with \"And then he quit\" without much explanation. Nobody else had any better ideas, and even as an 8-year-old I had, ahem, a forceful personality when I thought the occasion called for it, so my classmates didn't argue with me. I have no idea what grade we made on that project, but I shudder to think of how incoherent it was. The experience left me with an abiding horror of group projects and picking research topics last and a residual retention of inane trivia about Nixon. I can't tell you on most days what I had for dinner the day before, but I can still reel off Nixon's birthdate, birthplace, alma maters, religious affiliation, and all other manner of other facts about him instantly. As I got old enough to understand the more complex aspects of Nixon's personality, I also started to find him personally fascinating. But I haven't read anything about him in a long time. Since Nixon has been getting mentioned a lot in the press lately in comparison to the current resident of the White House, I figured I'd rekindle my interest in \"Tricky Dick.\" (For the record, I don't think comparing Nixon to Trump is a particularly apt parallel. Some of Trump's actions reflect Nixon's and may lead down the same road, but I think Trump and LBJ are a lot more similar in personality.)Evan Thomas is more interested in delving into Nixon's personality and getting to know his human side than providing a comprehensive sketch of his life, and he manages to do so without devolving into psychobabble. Thomas was more sympathetic to Nixon that I had assumed he'd be, but he's also remarkably even-handed in his depiction, shying away from neither Nixon's massive flaws nor his substantial strengths. I didn't necessarily agree with all of Thomas's conclusions, but they were rooted in research and well-reasoned. Perhaps by necessity, a large part of the book focuses on Nixon's presidency, as well as his time as Vice President under Eisenhower, but I sometimes wanted more information on Nixon's early years, which were marred by family tragedy, and early political career as a California congressman. Other than his involvement in the Hiss case, that's dealt with fairly perfunctorily. I might be biased as the daughter of two naval supply petty officers, but I also wanted more information on his service as a supply officer during WWII. (I told my dad that Nixon had spent over a year working as Navy supply officer, and he instantly asked, \"Did he order his men to steal as much stuff as our officers did?\" Well, the book is sadly uninformative on that point.)Nonetheless, it's an interesting and thought-provoking read that I had a hard time putting down. I'd definitely read another Evan Thomas bio. (After I finish my Nixon research binge.)"}, {"userName": "Noah Goats", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats", "userReview": "Nixon was such a strange, complicated man, a bundle of contradictions. He was a man who seemed to wear his own skin like a hair shirt.Born into a family that struggled with money and had an abusive father, Nixon rose to the highest levels of government through hard work, intelligence, excellent political instincts, and some dirty politicking. He was a politician who was deeply shy and uncomfortable around people. Many aspects of his chosen profession were torture to him. He wasn't good at schmoozing or kissing babies, and he didn't enjoy doing it. But his ambition was an even more powerful driving force than his shyness, and it constantly pushed him forward.When you look back on his record he has many impressive (and mostly liberal leaning) achievements: Detent and arms control agreements with the Russians, creating the EPA and OSHA, ending the draft, completing desegregation, lowering the voting age to 18, reopening relations with China, getting the US (eventually) out of Vietnam, a war that he inherited from his predecessors... he should have been loved. It's an impressive record.Unfortunately, he was dirty and dishonest and all his accomplishments are tainted. He lied about everything from Vietnam to Watergate (he may have even subversively worked to extend the war at the end of Johnson's term for political reasons). He was probably not much more dirty or dishonest than Johnson and Kennedy (who wiretapped everyone and didn't mind buying votes), but he had an appalling personality as well, plus, he got caught.Even Thomas seems to really understand Nixon, in all his complexity. He is fair and as sympathetic as the facts allow. This is a great biography (so good that I have already purchased and begun reading Thomas's book about RFK, which is maybe even better )."}, {"userName": "Greg Talbot", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2348903-greg-talbot", "userReview": "Heraclitus -.. A man's character is his fate.Greek tragedy feels appropriate for the high highs of Nixon's leadership and ultiamte unspooling with the Watergate scandal. It's hard to imagine another leader who was so central to U.S. politics, at so many cultural points - vice president to Einsenhower, candidate for the RNC against Kennedy in 1960, elected president in 1968, 1972. Responsible for opening U.S. involvement to China, moving the U.S. toward nuclear dearmament along with Russia, and deeping involvement with the Vietnam war. A fairly linear biography, the focus is squarely on Nixon the man. His fascinating personality is revealed from stories of loner episodes as a boy, flairs for the dramatic in theater, rigorous learning as a law student, and shrewd effectiveness political manuevering as an official.My biggest issue with the book is how little context there is of the events unfolding around Nixon. Very little attention given to the Vietnam War, or how the cultural issues effected Nixon. There is a a moment of solidarity that Nixon has with the protestors after the Kent State Shooting, but the research feels limited.Overall a fascinating biography"}, {"userName": "LaurieH118", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4009800-laurieh118", "userReview": "I'm a late Baby Boomer. For me, Richard Nixon has always been a villain or a punchline. That's not completely undeserved. Much of the disdain for career politicians that is so prevalent among voters began with \"Tricky Dick\" and Watergate.But Nixon was not ALL bad. And to borrow from Bill Clinton's eulogy, it's important to look at his life in its entirety. Evan Thomas presents us with just that.Much of his corrosive drive came from envy. It began with Robert Logue, his classmate and competitor back at Whittier High -- athletic, good looking, perpetually tan, where Nixon's nickname was \"Gloomy Gus.\" After Logue, JFK must have felt like a recurring nightmare. Nixon's Kennedy obsession is pathetic and ugly, continuing well past Dallas to Chappaquidick and beyond. So pointless, because, as Jackie wrote in response to Nixon's condolence message, Nixon got to enjoy what Kennedy could not, his life and his family. It went on to Kissinger and his close relationship with \"The Georgetown Crowd.\" Even though he was President, the most powerful man in the free world, he insisted on viewing himself as a persecuted outsider. And, of course, there's the language we hear on the tapes -- racist, anti-Semitic, crass, and opportunistic. Reading those passages is about as tasty as drinking Drano.And yet ... and yet ... there's so much more to him. The brilliant mind, the political prescience. The patriotism and (I can't believe I'm attributing this to Richard Nixon) idealism. His kindness and loyalty to Rose Mary Woods and John Mitchell. Most touching, his relationship with Pat and the girls. My favorite moment is the one Thomas quotes more than once. As guests would slip out of a White House screening because they'd given up on the movie, Nixon would stop them and encourage them to stay. \"Wait! It'll get better!\" That was his attitude after every setback (even and especially the tragic ones he engineered).I loved the details Thomas shared that were new to me. The Nixon White House knew all along that Deep Throat was Mark Felt; Pat Nixon understood how bad Watergate was before her husband did; Nixon's best friend and closest companion was his legal pad, where he could make notes and consult them throughout the night. I hadn't been aware of Nixon's insomnia. Just as Bryce Harlow wondered what Nixon could have accomplished if he felt loved, I wonder if how history would have been different if Nixon could regularly get a good night's sleep.Thomas tells Nixon's story with balance and compassion and many a graceful turn of phrase. A good read."}, {"userName": "Scott Cox", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21638774-scott-cox", "userReview": "Biographer Evan Thomas noted that Richard Nixon\u2019s accomplishments as the 37th President of the United States were legion. He opened the door to relations with Communist China, achieved d\u00e9tente and arms control with the Communist Soviet Union, ended the Vietnam War (however arduous and circuitous the route), ended the military draft, helped desegregate Southern schools, increased benefits for the elderly and disabled, and helped create the Environment Protection Agency. Nixon even proposed a comprehensive national health insurance decades before Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama introduced their health care initiatives. His conservatism resonated with an American \u201csilent majority,\u201d at least until his climatic downfall and resignation during the Watergate investigation. What went wrong? Thomas was fair and balanced in his approach (hence the 5 star rating). He traced Nixon\u2019s weaknesses to his youth where he never seemed to be comfortable or well adjusted. These traits carried into his political career. From the beginning, the East Coast liberal establishment and news media hated Nixon. This began in earnest when, as a California senator, Nixon successfully revealed Alger Hiss to be a Soviet spy. This was an embarrassment to the \u201cHarvard elite;\u201d one which Nixon could never overcome. He was the brunt of bad press and political dirty tricks when he unsuccessfully ran against John F. Kennedy in 1960. Sadly, it was during this period when Nixon began to feel that he must retaliate in like manner. At the height of his popularity, he encouraged his staff to \u201cplay dirty\u201d to win the 1972 election. This led to the infamous Watergate break-in, and to Nixon\u2019s attempt to cover up (instead of owning up to the misdeed) the illegal activity in order to protect friends. As Thomas sagely noted, \u201cIt is hard to explain this failure of judgment, the most critical mistake Nixon ever made. Favoring hush money over full disclosure was a moral lapse, regardless of whether Nixon had committed a crime\u201d (p.439). After his Presidential resignation (and President Ford\u2019s controversial pardon), Nixon became a highly regarded statesman and political advisor to subsequent Presidents. Thomas eloquently ends his biography, \u201cIt is one of the mysteries \u2013 and glories \u2013 of human nature that sinners can become saints. But only in prayers of another world are saints truly cleansed of sin.\u201d"}, {"userName": "victor harris", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5005999-victor-harris", "userReview": "Although forever blemished by the Watergate scandal, Nixon also can be credited with engineering a host of progressive legislative accomplishments, many which would have long term environmental impact. His main arena of expertise of foreign policy saw breakthroughs in relations with China, ending the war in Vietnam (after he expanded it into other parts of Southeast Asia), and reducing Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union. As the author shows in a very balanced account, Nixon was a contradictory and indeed polarizing figure.  Despite his mastery of the nuances of political gamesmanship and the ability to compromise with foes on the Congressional front to attain notable achievements, he was perpetually haunted by his inner demons and given to duplicity and chronic paranoia. Accessing the substantial public record and via interviews, Thomas compiles a workable and readable biography on much previously covered ground.  Ultimately one of Nixon's greatest assets - his prodigious memory, would also prove to be his greatest curse. He could not overlook any slight and harbored grievances way out of proportion to their importance. Along with his Kennedy loathing fetish and being surrounded by a like-minded cabal of amoral political operatives, his inability to bury his grudges would lead to the trail of his undoing. Indeed, one of the first orders of business once re-elected was to compile the famous \"Enemies List(s)\" and use the presidency to settle scores. He would enlist the aid of multiple government agencies to mount his campaign of revenge and eventually creating a Constitutional crisis that led to his downfall. Thomas on occasion almost makes Nixon a sympathetic figure while clearly not acting as an apologist for his misconduct. This ongoing tension between the person and the politician gives this account much of its appeal."}, {"userName": "Trey Benfield", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11456292-trey-benfield", "userReview": "Fantastic writing.

However, we forget his commitment to civil rights, knowledge of foreign affairs, opening of China, detente with Russia, settlement of Vietnam, and ending the draft.

The New York Times bestselling author of Ike\u2019s Bluff and Sea of Thunder, Thomas brings new life to one of American history\u2019s most infamous, paradoxical, and enigmatic politicians, dispensing with myths to achieve an intimate and nuanced look at the actual man. What drove a painfully shy outcast in elite Washington society\u2014a man so self-conscious he refused to make eye contact during meetings\u2014to pursue power and public office? How did a president so attuned to the American political id that he won reelection in a historic landslide lack the self-awareness to recognize the gaping character flaws that would drive him from office and forever taint his legacy? In Being Nixon, Evan Thomas peels away the layers of the complex, confounding figure who became America\u2019s thirty-seventh president. The son of devout Quakers, Richard Nixon (not unlike his rival John F. Kennedy) grew up in the shadow of an older, favored brother and thrived on conflict and opposition. Through high school and college, in the navy and in politics, he was constantly leading crusades and fighting off enemies real and imagined. As maudlin as he was Machiavellian, Nixon possessed the plainspoken eloquence to reduce American television audiences to tears with his career-saving \u201cCheckers\u201d speech; meanwhile, his darker half hatched schemes designed to take down his political foes, earning him the notorious nickname \u201cTricky Dick.\u201d Drawing on a wide range of historical accounts, Thomas reveals the contradictions of a leader whose vision and foresight led him to achieve d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union and reestablish relations with communist China, but whose underhanded political tactics tainted his reputation long before the Watergate scandal. One of the principal architects of the modern Republican Party and its \u201csilent majority\u201d of disaffected whites and conservative ex-Dixiecrats, Nixon was also deemed a liberal in some quarters for his efforts to desegregate Southern schools, create the Environmental Protection Agency, and end the draft. A deeply insightful character study as well as a brilliant political biography, Being Nixon offers a surprising look at a man capable of great bravery and extraordinary deviousness\u2014a balanced portrait of a president too often reduced to caricature.Praise for Being Nixon\u201cA biography of eloquence and breadth . . .
