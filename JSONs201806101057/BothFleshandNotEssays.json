This collection of essays was also really well written yet I found some of it boring, especially the two on tennis. I honestly hate watching sports except maybe soccer and regardless of that eloquent essay about the beauty of the human body and tennis or the commercialization at the US open I still had to drag myself through those two. I however did enjoy the essays about writing much more, especially the one where he talks about fun and writing. The comparison of ones own work to a deformed baby was funny, at least to me which probably doesn't say anything good about me. The essay on the problems and changes in writing because of cultural changes was interesting, though I'm not sure how much I agree with the often said sentiment that our attention spans are getting shorter, which tends to grate on my nerves. The essay about a book and it's metaphysical message conveyed through writing was interesting but I havent read that book so I was halfheartedly reading it. I also don't think I agree very much with the messages in the essay on AIDS or Math, even though the writing in the AIDS essay amused me greatly. I guess my point is I don't agree with a lot of what's expressed in the book and some of the essays weren't as interesting to me but I enjoyed the writing enough to give it four stars.Also side note is this kind of thing common with journalists where they publish books of their essays, because I'm not sure I get what the purpose it besides to show off their superior writing. Not that theres anything wrong with that its just a lot of the essays from both Wallace and Didion's collections seem to be from the 1980's and somewhat onward to early 2000's and so they're seem slightly irrelevant."}, {"userName": "s.penkevich", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6431467-s-penkevich", "userReview": "Consider the B-sidesAs often with posthumous collections, Both Flesh and Not suffers slightly from the fact that these essays were bound together for the simple reason of producing another book to fill the shelves and minds of DFW\u2019s perfervid fans and readers. It was only fitting to release another collection of essays riding on the heels of D.T. Max\u2019s biography of Wallace, and with his other posthumous work, The Pale King, having been nominated for the Pulitzer. While all of these essays are available elsewhere, and do seem a bit thrown together in an all-too-short collection, having a new Wallace book in my hands is a reason to celebrate. The essays are full of his charm, with his biting wit and humor that is sure to make anyone laugh, and the great, impassioned rants he composes for palm-in-the-face blunders such as Williamson\u2019s Borges biography. Despite being slightly disappointing compared to, say, Consider the Lobster, this is a great collection that is sure to satisfy anyone else jonesing for more DFW. This collection is signature DFW. Starting off on his Federer essay, it is always a pleasure to feel Wallace\u2019s excitement and pure joy for tennis flowing off the page. It was also enjoyable as I too am a fan of Roger Federer and could share in his passion for expressing how cool it is to witness amazing Federer moments. Through all these essays, you feel more as if Wallace is communicating with you instead of merely lecturing at you, which is a large part of why I really enjoy his writing. It always feels like his major purpose aside from informing is to get you as equally excited about the subject as he is. Such as in essays like 24 Word Notes, which is a great companion piece to his Authority and American Usage in Consider the Lobster and Other Essays, DFW has the ability to make studying grammar seem like some sort of rock star lifestyle. He makes grammar cool, exciting, and enjoyable (he also makes me painfully aware I need to work on my own grammar). He also has an amazing ability to give what seems like a fair, even assessment of his topics, such as his essay on the \u2018Conspicuously Young\u2019 writers, the literary Brat Pack, where he both defends them while pointing out the criticisms that are \u2018mean, but unfortunately fair\u2019. This essay is one to surely not miss. Humor is a big draw to DFW, and his way of insulting a topic in such a way that you can\u2019t help but rolling on the floor laughing as you nod your head in agreement. He has a gift for tearing things apart with his wit, such as in the essay on Terminator 2 (which, in turn, is an essay widely praising Cameron\u2019s early work in Aliens and the first Terminator):'1990s moviegoers who have sat clutching their heads in both awe and disappointment at movies like \u201cTwister\u201d and \u201cVolcano\u201d and \u201cThe Lost World\u201d can thank James Cameron\u2019s \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day\u201d for inaugurating what\u2019s become this decade\u2019s special new genre of big-budget film: Special Effects Porn. \u201cPorn\u201d because, if you substitute F/X for intercourse, the parallels between the two genres become so obvious they\u2019re eerie. Just like hard-core cheapies, movies like \u201cTerminator 2\u2033 and \u201cJurassic Park\u201d aren\u2019t really \u201cmovies\u201d in the standard sense at all. What they really are is half a dozen or so isolated, spectacular scenes \u2014 scenes comprising maybe twenty or thirty minutes of riveting, sensuous payoff \u2014 strung together via another sixty to ninety minutes of flat, dead, and often hilariously insipid narrative.'DFW successfully explains the major problems of the 90s blockbuster. He does use the sexual metaphor often, and in the essay The New Fire, which deals with AIDs as the Dragon standing in the way of the sexual revolution Knight. The major issue with this collection is that it simply takes essays from all over his career and tosses them together. Many are rather short, a few being only 2-3 pages (although I loved to read his thoughts on Zbigniew Herbert ), and many seem to work more as a companion to essays in earlier collections. It is a great book for a fan who has already explored much of his work, granted they had not already read most of these online, but I would advise new readers to come back for this one later. It was slightly disappointing is well that the best essay in the collection is one I had already read when I first experienced Markson\u2019s wonderful Wittgenstein\u2019s Mistress. In a later essay, Wallace says of WM \u2018that a novel this abstract and erudite and avant-garde that could also be so moving makes \u201cWittgenstein\u2019s Mistress\u201d pretty much the high point of experimental fiction in this country\u2019. That, coming from Wallace, is high praise.Despite the shortcomings, this was still an enjoyable read. It always breaks my heart to think of Wallace and his tragic end, especially as much of his work deals with loneliness. There are many times I wish I could have given him an enormous hug and said \u2018I love you man, please don\u2019t leave us\u2019. While he may no longer be with us, at least we still have David Foster Wallace\u2019s wonderful novels and essays to make this world a little less lonely.3.5/5"}, {"userName": "B0nnie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7355135-b0nnie", "userReview": "[THE BEST BOOK OF 1994 is the first English translation of Zbigniew Herbert's Mr. Cogito, a book of poems that came out in Poland in the mid-1970s, well before Herbert's justly famous Report from the Besieged City and Other Poems. Mr. Cogito's a character who appears in most of Herbert's best poems\u2014he's kind of a poetic Pnin, both intellectual and not too bright, both hopelessly confused and bravely earnest as he grapples with the Big Questions of human existence.Zbigniew Herbert is one of the two or three best living poets in the world, and by far the best of what you'd call the \"postmoderns.\" Since any great poem communicates an emotional urgency that postmodernism's integument of irony renders facile or banal, postmodern poets have a tough row to hoe. Herbert's Cogito-persona permits ironic absurdism andearnest emotion not only to coexist but to nourish one another.Compared to Mr. Cogito, the whole spectrum of American poetry\u2014from the retrograde quaintness of the Neoformalists and New-Yorker-hackyard-garden-meditative lyrics to the sterile abstraction of the Language Poets\u2014looks sick. It seems significant that only writers from Eastern Europe and Latin America have succeeded in marrying the stuff of spirit and human feeling to the parodic detachment the postmodern experience seems to require.

Although of course* I didn\u2019t want (or expect) to dislike this book, at all, I did want to be able to say something that proves I could be brusque with/critical of DFW just as easily as I could gush over/laud him. I wanted to be able to establish my Howling fandom by accentuating my knowledge of his prior collections, and concluding that this one doesn\u2019t quite stack up. But alas, I cannot. Foster Wallace is as sublime as ever (realizing that these essays span many years of his career, and have been accessible in uncollected form for some time), bordering on the awesome, in the real sense; not in the bastardized sense that, as Eddie Izzard has pointed out, \u2018You got red and yellow socks? They\u2019re awesome!\u2019 Foster Wallace characteristically provoked many breath-catching, head-shaking moments for this reader with his ability to essentially speak, in an almost vicarious form, for you (well, me at least), but better. Nobody needs me to recommend DFW to them, so I am going to provide selected explanations of and thoughts on selected essays of the collection.In Federer Both Flesh and Not, our correspondent makes frequent pleas for us to attend a live professional tennis match so that we may witness the beauty and power that television is incapable of exhibiting. And you know what? I am mostly convinced that it would be rewarding to oblige. Well done again, for inciting some interest in tennis, in which, like many of his readers, I was not previously much interested. He was not faking his love for the game by any stretch of the imagination. Both Fictional Futures and the Conspicuously Young and The Empty Plenum were, with guillotine-like force, jaw-dropping in their articulation and insight. The former is an inspection of the young writers of contemporary fiction (beginning in the 1980\u2019s), and a literary generational gap, and I suspect it is argued (actually I\u2019ve heard it said), that subsequent literary generations have only gotten worse. This is quite contentious, obviously, because it rips a chasm in the old chestnut of what constitutes art. It lacks tendentiousness, but not sympathy. It may also explain, in part, Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s dismay over the posthumous encomium of Foster Wallace, whose work (BEE\u2019s, that is), even if not mentioned by name in the essay, could have been ascertained by the invented term Neiman-Marcus Nihilism, which is truly a bit of genius upon finding out what Neiman-Marcus was. (I\u2019m not particularly upper-class savvy). The latter is the highly praised philosophical exposition of (/introduction to?) David Markson\u2019s novel Wittgenstein\u2019s Mistress, which I have not read, but intend to very soon. But the ways that loneliness and solipsism are dealt with are nothing short of utterly piercing. Whether it\u2019s in pointing out the error of Descartes\u2019 Cogito ergo sum, (because ever since reading him, I never felt he had valid ripostes to his own purported impasses), or the plight of Kate in WM in writing, not speaking, the content of the novel. There is no one to speak to, and perhaps no one else to speak of. Anyway, reading these two, I felt like a slack-jawed yokel being introduced to electricity, to the literal degree that I was babbling incoherently about how incredible they was. To demonstrate that I know the definition of literal, I will share excerpts from a conversation I had with a friend right after finishing Fictional Futures (omitting my second party\u2019s inputs): I can't believe DFW wrote like that in 1987...Or had those ideas\u2026I feel pathetic that it was mostly revelatory to me, or at least the way he articulated it\u2026 The entire essay\u2026Sorry, I just...Ellis is just one example he used in discussing the whole subject of Conspicuously Young writers of that era, and literary criticism thereafter\u2026He was only (about) 30(?) when he wrote that essay, which I find peculiar somehow\u2026 I thought it was really good, but I may be naive and even ignorant about what has transpired in the literary world since then, but also the fact that he felt comfortable speaking that way of his own generation of writers\u2026 Parts of it, perhaps\u2026 I feel cold right now, like I don't understand literature, but there were those hints he put in as if to say 'fuck it all'...I don't know\u2026You'll have to read it\u2026 I may need to talk about it some more\u2026I can't do anything but babble right now\u2026I can't be coherent, hahahahaha. (What I meant to say was, \u2018I can\u2019t speak coherently\u2019).By a wide margin, the best parts of Democracy and Commerce at the U.S. Open, another tennis one, were the footnoted complaints about the concession stands, and a brief, somewhat sad, yet wholly hilarious, exchange with a woman who, like him, wanted relief from the crowd. Back in New Fire explores sexuality in a reserved, but by no means puritanical, and in a particularly serious, yet paradoxically hilarious way, in light of the AIDS outbreak. In it, he administers a wonderful and convincing metaphor for sexuality in a knight battling a dragon to rescue the princess and commence coitus. He also delivers one of the most painfully true statements ever documented w/r/t naturally occurring diseases, specifically AIDS: \u201cNothing from nature is good or bad. Natural things just are; the only good and bad things are people\u2019s various choices in the face of what is. But our own history shows that\u2014for whatever reasons\u2014an erotically charged human existence requires impediments to passion, prices for choices.\u201d Okay, I could get into why we would even need to think in terms of reasons. I could also take issue him applying the word choices and get into the vexing subject of free will, but those would be digressions for the sake of this statement, which makes a hell of a lot of sense. Appropriately labeled F/X Porn and the Inverse Cost and Quality Law which states \u201cvery simply that the larger a movie\u2019s budget is, the shittier that movie is going to be\u201d perfectly sums up what has seemed to have happened to Hollywood. A strange subject to be known as prophetic on, but god damn, he nailed it in The (As it Were) Seminal Importance of Terminator 2.The Nature of the Fun is on the necessity of writing. This is the specific one I referred to, in which he is uncannily able to translate the thoughts of, presumably, many writers (and indeed many aspiring writers) to tremendous effect. I\u2019m not suggesting that it is necessarily universal, but the plight of a writer seems to be both a shared and mutually understood burden, as well as an unconditional adoration, the likes of which cannot be lived without. And, for what it\u2019s worth, I agree that Don DeLillo\u2019s hideously damaged infant metaphor is probably the finest that someone could come up with, because even if one\u2019s project is irreversibly doomed (terminally ill), and will never make it to publication (adulthood), it is a component of who one is. I feel a strong urge to endlessly clamor on about how apt this essay was, but I\u2019ll save it for a drunken conversation (with any and all of you folks).Rhetoric and the Math Melodrama is a very funny piece on a class of genre fiction that I really didn\u2019t even know existed. He tells us to call it \u201cGeek Chic\u201d or \u201cHip(2b)2\u201d. While reading, I had no choice but to agree whenever our correspondent opined that he couldn\u2019t figure out the target audience for this type of math fiction, because those who would be able to understand its esoteric content, would undoubtedly realize the errors and pulled-from-their-ass algorithms and, um, calibrator sets? And those who aren\u2019t part of the mathematics elite wouldn\u2019t pick the book up in the first place. But I may have to read one of these novels now if only to use this essay as a companion piece. Written in bulleted notes, The Best of the Prose Poem expresses my anxiety and confusion to a T of what prose poetry actually is, and according to whom, and what its distinguishing features are from flash fiction, & etc. What do I write that I have the right to deem poetry? Was what I just wrote a poem? Why not?Twenty-Four Word Notes helped me with grammar more than all of my accumulated English education through high school. That is not hyperbolic. This made me want to return to everything I have ever written and fix them in all the ways he discusses, albeit I am sure that I have perniciously blundered much of this review itself, by his standards. I want more of these notes, and I want to commit them to memory. DFW has written on Kafka. He\u2019s written on Lynch. He now tackles Borges; well, more accurately, the biography of Borges by Edwin Williamson, which I own, but also have not read yet. This essay, titled Borges on the Couch has not dissuaded me from reading Borges: A Life, but has given me reason to take many of Williamson\u2019s claims with a grain of salt, particularly w/r/t the psychological aspects and conclusions that are drawn from Borges\u2019 fiction. I think DFW here points out what is inherently problematic about biographies (which causes even more skepticism about his own recent biography by D.T. Max), which is that \u201c\u2026interpretations (of respective writers\u2019 work) amount to a simplistic, dishonest kind of psychological criticism.\u201dLadies and gentlemen, I close by saying (a la, or credit to, Christopher Hitchens, for dramatic opening line of closing statement) something combative (perhaps unnecessary and irrelevant as well [which I may regret if any fussy European exclusivists or counter-counter-culturalists happen upon my word-type-things]). Anyone who claims that DFW was somehow unintelligent, or was blowing smoke, or was disingenuous, is a fink, and probably rather disingenuous themselves. Not everyone has to enjoy him, or even think he\u2019s worth much in the literary canon, but the observational evidence does not coincide with such strident allegations as stated supra.David Foster Wallace, we still love you old boy. *This serves both as an obligatory homage to DFW\u2019s use of language and his trademark footnotes."}, {"userName": "MJ Nicholls", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2386804-mj-nicholls", "userReview": "Not quite up there with ASFTINDA or CTL in terms of sheer stuck-to-the-chair-then-flung-off-the-same-chair-in-squeeing-delight pleasure factor, but BFAN is arguably a more eclectic collection than either, treating us to one courtside tennis feature, one neurotic backstage tennis featurette, an unsurpassable academic-and-not reading of Wittgenstein\u2019s Mistress, a deliciously snotty horn-tooting \u201cwe\u2019ve arrived, ma!\u201d for his then-emerging fiction contemps, something vague and unappetising about AIDS, a necessary evisceration of Terminator 2, several shavings on being-a-writer and Borges and writing Best Essay intros, a witty and high-level dissection of Math Melodramas, a nasty out-of-character satirical curiosity on \u201cprose poets,\u201d and pedantry from his wet-dream OED contributions. BFAN pretty much traverses the DFW cranium in a startling manner that (arguably) the other two collections miss given the length and content congruencies of the pieces in those respective pubs, and the inclusion of snippings from his private dictionary between each essay here adds to the swirl of facts and data that DFW made it his life\u2019s work to deciderize in charming and unpretentious and intellectually robust ways for his contracted organs and readerships and eventual hardback readers."}, {"userName": "Nathan \"N.R.\" Gaddis", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7607437-nathan-n-r-gaddis", "userReview": "[update: Howling Fantods has removed many links from their Uncollected DFW page, at the request of Karen and Little Brown.

These pieces are:Fictional Futures and the Conspicuously Young: on the effect of TV on young writers in the 80's. Young writers get divided into camps that now seem rather obvious and even dated as some no longer really exist: Workshop manufactured, chemically neutered, corpse-grinders (\"stories as tough to find fault with as they are to remember after putting them down\"); catatonic Carver clones, offshoots of the dirty realism fad created by Carver/Lish/Granta; and yuppie nihilists in the vein of Bret Easton Ellis, which, btw, explains BEE's adolescent twitter attacks against DFW coinciding with the publication of this book. These attacks, amusing and pathetic though they were, reminded me of Franzen\u00b4s postmortem evisceration of his best friend in The New Yorker. Waiting for someone to die before you can work up the courage to attack them publicly is always a great demonstration of character.The Empty Plenum: which explains DFW's claim that Markson's Wittgenstein's Mistress was a masterpiece and illuminates Wallace's own admiration for late Wittgenstein and his philosophy of language.Mr. Cogito: basically a blurb for a Zbigniew Herbert's book.The Nature of fun: on how publishing and any amount of recognition are bad for writers, who should avoid thinking about the reception of their books like the plague. Jeffers famously said about this: \"The only fame that is not harmful to a writer is posterity\". Classic Wallace double bind stuff.Five direly underappreciated US novels: self explanatory.Rhetoric and Math Melodrama: explains why math and literature should not mix. He would've done well to follow his own advice on this.The Best of the Prose Poem: on why prose poems do not really exist.Borges on the Couch: against psychoanalytic biographical interpretaions of literature. This bookends nicely with Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky, from CTL.Deciderization: DFW was made editor of the Best American Essays volume for 2007. Imagine therefore the amount of essayistic hand-wringing involved in Wallace confronting the concept of deciding why one essay is \"better\" than another.That pretty much is the extent of the writer\u00b4s writer pieces in the book. The other ones are on tennis (Both Flesh and Not: on Federer and the aesthetics of sports; Democracy and Commerce in the US Open: on just that, same approach as ASFTINDA, but with the US Open and way less passion, thoroughly yawn-inducing), on AIDS as an opportunity to reevaluate what sex is and means (Welcome to New Fire), freedom and terrorism (Just asking), on how Hollywood movies can be art and how good directors get corrupted (Terminator) and words, grammar and usage (24 Word Notes).This last one tickles me because there is a short video of Wallace explaining his dislike of \"puff-words\", which is the point of his first word criticism on that 24 word list. Very concisely, Wallace's problem with \"utilize\" is that it is a puff-word for which a simpler more common word exists: \"use\". This is funny because I can think of very few writers more attuned to how using a more complex synonym for what you are trying to say colors your prose. Wallace, of course, was always wrestling with this polarity (be erudite to the point of snobbery, but also as casual and street-wise as possible). Further, in the video you can see in Wallace's face his disgust for snobs who will steal one extra third of a second from him by using puff-words in one of those very unusual unguarded moments where he is projecting a really negative emotion publicly. I shudder to imagine him having this same reaction after reading some draft of himself he wasn't satisfied with.

The two sport pieces, one on Federer and one about the U.S. Open, were both engaging to their core whether you happen to like tennis or not. What I liked most about Wallace was his ability to make almost anything he wrote interesting and worth reading. No matter what his subject, with the exception of math and poetry, I found his writing captivating and full of his own personality, which is something I am enthralled with in no little measure. I am not as enamored with David Markson's Wittgenstein's Mistress as Wallace and others seem to regale it, but his essay proved to be one many people read and agree with. When Wallace deconstructs poetry and fiction I also rarely agree with him and find his thinking off base, but still, he always makes his words so much fun to read. And speaking of fun he even wrote an essay that included Don DeLillo and the fun of writing in it, which is an enormous stretch too as DeLillo, for me, is rarely fun and so intense I generally need to mist to cool off my brain from thinking. But his essay on Terminator 2 was so good it made me watch Terminator 1 for the very first time. This essay alone made the book definitely worth the purchase price. Deciderization 2007 and Just Asking were both very good essays that shed more light on our \"best of\" series as well as if some things are actually worth dying for. I finished the book as if riding my bicycle with my back to a strong wind. It was easy and sad and filling, and I think I am done reading anymore \"new\" essay collections or novels of David Foster Wallace just because I don't think he wanted anymore published, even this one."}, {"userName": "Oriana", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30800-oriana", "userReview": "just seeing the cover of a new DFW book turns me into an all-id slavering animal child\u2014gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme!!"}, {"userName": "Paul Gleason", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8505940-paul-gleason", "userReview": "It didn't take me very long to get through DFW's posthumous collection because I'd read most of its essays before. But what's surprising is that I didn't need to reread the essays because I'd internalized them so much. This internalization speaks to the power of DFW's writing - for this reader, at least. I've said it before, and I'll probably say it again many times before I shake loose my mortal coil, but DFW's writing seems to be hardwired in my brain.On to the collection . . . Which is, as to be expected, terrific. The only reason that I'm not giving it five stars is because it has the feel of an odds-and-sods kind of thing - of a way for the publishers to cash in on DFW's reputation. I mean, does his review of the Borges bio need to be collected? In other words, some of the essays, especially those in the second half of the book, seem to be of minor import. This means that everything from p. 203 on seems kind of tacked on.But the material that comes before! I've always loved DFW's essays on tennis, and his piece on Federer is one of his finest. I'd already loved Roger before DFW's essay, but the Federer essay made me see the greatest men's player who ever lived in a new light. DFW humanizes the reserved Roger with his humorous and lively prose in this awesome essay. For those of you who don't like RF for being stiff or if you don't understand his brilliance, please read this essay.The piece on the US Open is also pretty terrific, especially the comments on how Sampras sweats. It's DFW, so the essay is funny and spot on. Don't you want to know how Pete sweats?DFW's anxiety of influence comes in when he discusses Bret Easton Ellis in the \"Fictional Futures\" piece. The two writers seem to me to have more in common that DFW is willing to acknowledge. But this essay was written by a very young DFW about a very young BEE. I wonder what DFW would have thought of BEE's later, self-lacerating Lunar Park or the postmodern innovations of Glamorama and Imperial Bedrooms. I think that an older DFW would have liked an older BEE more, although the same can't be said for BEE's take on DFW.The best essay in this collection - and one of the only ones I hadn't come across before - is on Markson's Wittgenstein's Mistress. Like DFW, I did a lot of philosophy in grad school. Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Derrida - really anyone who thought deeply about language and, more specifically, the relationship between being, language, and power - got me all hot and bothered. I've lost a lot of the luster that I've had for theory, but DFW brought it back for me. His claim about the ways in which Markson illustrates the scariness of the early Wittgenstein is tremendous and helps me understand not only Wittgenstein's Mistress a lot better but also the other Markson novels I've read. (Markson is the kind of writer whose books I used to read at Borders, holding my breath to hold in the brilliance of the prose, unable to stop before I finished whatever book I was reading - maybe that's why Wittgenstein's Mistress is the only Markson I own). I love Wittgenstein's Mistress, and DFW made me love it more.A side note: I bet that Markson does for Wittgenstein what Beckett does for deconstruction. Both writers make difficult theory accessible by dramatizing it and discussing how it relates to the human condition, particularly sadness. But I'd argue that Beckett is better than Markson because of his comedy. Here endeth the side note.The essay on Cameron's Terminator film as pornography is brilliant and funny. Read it. The essay on \"The Nature of Fun\" gets at what it's like to be a writer better than any other essay on the subject I've ever read. I love how DFW expands on DeLillo's Mao II. If you're considering becoming a writer, you need to read this essay. I've shared it with a few friends and family members. It's given me insight into my own writerly psyche and made me think about how I come across to other people.In conclusion, you need to read this book. It's definitely tougher sledding than DFW's other two collections of essays. It's more theoretical and difficult. But DFW was a lot more than the fun and funny stuff he published in Fun Thing and Lobster. Have fun challenging yourself with this one - and read some Wittgenstein, Markson, DeLillo, Gass, and the other writers DFW cites if you haven't already done so.P.S. I think that DFW would agree with me that C. McCarthy lost it after Blood Meridian."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5706981-michael", "userReview": "As might be expected from a posthumous essay collection, this is a bit uneven. The title piece on Roger Federer is amazing, and several other pieces are quite good. But a couple of long pieces from the '80s and '90s were passed over for inclusion in prior collections, and it's apparent why. The one on Conspicuously Young writers rambles, is a kind of stiff, and its discussion of TV's influence on his generation is better fleshed out in \"E Unibus Plurum.\" And his Tennis Magazine piece on commerce at the U.S. Open, while it features some great writing (especially on the sport itself, the experience of watching, and on his experience of watching the fans), it gets bogged down in both hyper-observational specificity and in amassing support for its thesis. There are some fun and/or thoughtful, shorter pieces, especially in the book's latter half, like his round-up of five great post-1960 novels, his 24 thoughts on word usage, his philosophies around Terminator 2 (which is a middle distance essay, really), etc. This collection is worth reading, but selectively.

Having recently lost a loved one in a rather dramatic fashion, I was also taken back those ordurous emotions I felt on September 12/13, 2008 when I heard that DFW killed himself. In the middle of this enormous banking/economic collapse, losing DFW (to others) might have seemed small. But almost 4.5 years later my 401(k) has recovered but I have yet to get over DFW killing himself. A tad dramatic? I'm sure. Anyway, back to my review of Both Flesh and Not.

(4a) The pieces\u2019 realistic imagery is concrete, its descriptions compact and associations tautly drawn. (4b) The pieces\u2019 surreal imagery/associations never seem gratuitously weird; i.e., they end up making psychological or emotional sense given what the p.p.\u2019s about.

Per\u00f2 ora \u00e8 davvero finito tutto, e questo Both Flesh and Not sar\u00e0, con ogni probabilit\u00e0, l\u2019ultimo libro di DFW che potremo sfogliare, leggere, scaffalare, lasciare sul comodino o portare al parco e leggerlo l\u00ec. Beninteso: i saggi di BFaN sono/erano tutti disponibili in rete e questo occasionale recensore li aveva gi\u00e0 letti tutti molto tempo prima che la Little, Brown & Co. li raccogliesse in questo libro. Mancano alcune recensioni, qualcuna anche interessante, come ad esempio quella del libro di Reynaldo Arenas e quella su Kathy Acker, ma poca roba se paragonata alla \u201ccarne\u201d che c\u2019\u00e8 qui.

In questo senso, se A Supposedly Fun Thing... conteneva saggi in qualche modo riconducibili alle trame e gli orditi di Infinite Jest, Both Fles and Not contiene tutti i saggi riconducibili alle trame e orditi che in un certo modo disegnano David Wallace come persona, come individuo costituito (anche) dalle cose che pi\u00f9 ha a cuore e che pi\u00f9 alberga(va)no nella sua indecifrabile e affascinante mente. Curioso che questo libro, qua in Italia, sar\u00e0 pubblicato insieme alla traduzione della biografia di D.T. Max. Va be\u2019, io non ho mai nascosto e tantomeno nascondo qua la mia profonda avversione per le biografie (3), ma questa volta \u00e8 lo stesso DFW che, tra le righe dei saggi qui contenuti, ci fa capire che le biografie e autobiografie/memoir degli autori siano una specie di malattia narcisistica/voyeristica della cultura contemporanea (e qui si trova la stroncatura di una biografia di Borges). Di un autore contano soltanto le opere, e sono quelle che costituiscono la miglior biografia di qualunque scrittore. Ecco: Both Flesh and Not \u00e8 la vera biografia di David Wallace: un\u2019autobiografia che lui ha scritto involontariamente e inconsapevolmente, dissezionando per noi (alcune del)le sue passioni e condividendo con noi ci\u00f2 che pensa del mondo, della cultura e della letteratura. L\u2019autobiografia di uno scrittore che nei libri, nei racconti e nei saggi che ha scritto, \u00e8 riuscito a saldare una poetica, uno stile letterario, un modo di vedere il mondo. Un\u2019etica. Beffardo che l\u2019ultima frase dell\u2019ultimo saggio dell\u2019ultimo libro di David Foster Wallace sia una domanda: \u201cWhat kind of future does that augure?\u201d Gi\u00e0, appunto: E ora?

Nel 2013 sembra essere esplosa la mania di celebrare l\u2019anniversario dei cinque anni di quel triste evento. In rapida successione sono usciti in Italia la biografica a cura di T. D. Max, la raccolta di Minimum Fax Un antidoto contro la solitudine, e questo Di carne e di nulla pubblicato da Einaudi e che fa da contraltare saggistico alla raccolta di racconti di qualche anno fa, sempre di Einaudi, Questa \u00e8 l\u2019acqua. Chiudendo magari un occhio per simpatia e coraggio sull\u2019operazione di Minimum Fax, che ha puntato su Wallace fin da subito e in tempi non sospetti, viene da domandarsi il motivo di tutto questo materiale mandato alle stampe, a fronte di un anniversario che, va beh, sono cinque anni mica un decennio. La fuggevole rapidit\u00e0 con cui passa il tempo unita alla nuova unit\u00e0 di misura dell\u2019era moderna, durante la quale tutto ha una vita assai pi\u00f9 breve, pare avere accorciato notevolmente l\u2019intervallo dopo il quale \u00e8 giusto celebrare qualcosa. Cos\u00ec come oggi bisogna sentirsi fortunati a festeggiare cinque anni di matrimonio, contro le nozze d\u2019argento o addirittura d\u2019oro di qualche generazione fa, anche il ricordo di un grande scrittore deve essere celebrato a breve distanza. Forse c\u2019\u00e8 la paura (infondata) che se non ci si fosse mossi con una certa urgenza gli attuali lettori smemorati si sarebbero presto dimenticati di Wallace, o piuttosto per seguire l\u2019antico detto secondo cui \u00e8 meglio battere il ferro finch\u00e9 \u00e8 caldo. Fatto sta che una volta finito di leggere questa raccolta di saggi ci si trova davanti a una sensazione straniante che nasce da una domanda piuttosto lecita. La sensazione straniante \u00e8 ovviamente quella che tu, lettore affamato di Wallace, avresti letto appunto qualsiasi cosa quest\u2019ultimo avesse avuto modo di scrivere, e sotto questo aspetto il libro \u00e8 come dell\u2019acqua offerta a un assetato in mezzo al deserto. Ma, c\u2019\u00e8 un ma. \u00c8 la domanda che ti fa salire in gola quel gusto acido capace di rovinarti un po\u2019 la lettura, ovvero: se tutti questi i saggi sono davvero indispensabili, come mai non sono stati pubblicati prima? E la domanda diventa anche pi\u00f9 insidiosa quando ti accorgi che alcuni articoli proposti nella versione americana sono stati sostituiti da alcune trascrizioni di interviste proprio perch\u00e9 gi\u00e0 precedentemente pubblicati (quelli relativi al tennis usciti sotto il titolo di Il tennis come esperienza religiosa). Il caso appare lampante se si prende in esame il saggio Notazioni su ventiquattro parole, nel quale Wallace analizza una lista di vocaboli americani annotandone il giusto utilizzo e commentandoli brevemente. \u00c8 davvero utile al lettore italiano leggere una cosa del genere? Soprattutto se si considera il fatto che il pi\u00f9 delle volte il traduttore non riesce a restituire in italiano il senso errato di alcune scelte sintattiche inglesi. \u00c8 un esempio, sia chiaro. Alcune altre cose sono davvero interessanti, come per esempio l\u2019articolo sull\u2019Aids o quello su Terminator 2 (il quale ti spinge a chiederti: chiss\u00e0 cosa avrebbe pensato Wallace di fronte a quel colosso di effetti speciali e retorica di Avatar?). Sar\u00e0 che quando finisci di leggere il libro ti rimane in bocca quell\u2019amaro senso di non pi\u00f9 che difficilmente riesci a toglierti di dosso, e che ti assilla tanto da farti vedere le cose negative pi\u00f9 grandi di quelle positive. Sar\u00e0 anche che chiudere con le trascrizioni delle interviste e delle conversazioni non \u00e8 stata proprio un\u2019idea brillante (in queste il lavoro stilistico di Wallace viene meno trattandosi di riproduzioni del parlato nudo e crudo). Alla fine sei appagato, si \u00e8 vero, ma ti torna di continuo in testa la sensazione che dare alle stampe questo libro sia stato non tanto un regalo ai lettori italiani di Wallace, quanto piuttosto un regalo alle casse dell\u2019editore."}, {"userName": "Sentimental Surrealist", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9707921-sentimental-surrealist", "userReview": "There's nothing particularly wrong with the essays here themselves. Yes, the early ones sometimes take a know-it-all tone, but on a whole, they're well-written and make compelling arguments. So why only three stars? Because I just don't get the feeling that DFW would've had many of these published if he had lived a little longer. While each of these essays pulls a respectable showing, he only gets the magic working with the reverent, breathless \"Federer Both Flesh and Not\" (Wallace pole A) and the satirical \"Democracy and Commerce at the U.S. Open\" (Wallace pole B). I also had fun with \"Overlooked,\" which has provided me with a reading list and is the sort of thing I wish Wallace had delved into more often, and \"The Nature of Fun.\" Elsewhere, he's mostly respectable - it's nice to see him knock Bret Easton Ellis off of his self-appointed perch - but his A game isn't there, which wouldn't be so much of a problem if his A game hadn't been at every piece in both A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again: Essays and Arguments and Consider the Lobster and Other Essays. Every essay in both of those books has stuck with me, where I'm having trouble remembering much about, say, \"Mr. Cogito\" or \"Rhetoric and the Math Melodrama\" or \"The Best of the Prose Poem\" or \"Back in New Fire.\"Besides, you can tell these are leftovers because Wallace had covered this ground much better in earlier essays. While Borges is probably the best of the illustrious (plus John Fucking Updike) authors Wallace has ever profiled, \"Borges on the Couch\" has nothing on \"Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky\" or \"Some Remarks on Kafka's Funniness from Which Probably Not Enough Has Been Removed\" in terms of insight, nor does it match \"Certainly the End of Something or Other, One Would Sort of Have to Think's\" humor. And if you want to see DFW get down and talk about film, who you gonna call? \"The (As It Were) Seminal Impact of Terminator 2\" or \"David Lynch Keeps His Head?\" Meanwhile, while \"Just Asking\" is nice and sincere and earnest, it's no \"View from Mrs. Thompson's\" as 9/11 commentary goes. And as for the heavy philosophy of \"Authority and American Usage\" or \"E Unibus Pluram,\" forget it.I'm a DFW nut, so I'm glad I own this, but I can't recommend this to anyone who isn't a DFW nut, whereas I'd recommend the other two essay collections to pretty much everyone.

Having loved his previous collections so much, I was thrilled to have another chance to spend time with him. And I had barely begun his first piece about tennis player Roger Federer's near mystical form before I was happily rewarded with his amazing ability to pull me into a subject I knew nothing about, infect me with his own fascination and wonder for said subject, and make me think outside of the normal patters of my own lazy brain, all while giving me the sensation that this genius was taking the time to do these things for me personally.I suppose it's that last ability of his that made reading this book simultaneously so sad, knowing all too well how the overall story of DFW ends. As I read his decades-old piece on the literary brat pack of the '80's, the first generation of writers who came of age in front of the television and thus who were raised with a consciousness of the importance of being watchable, I felt a deep frustration that I will never get to read the kind of extensive, witty, incisive, footnotes-within-footnotes essay DFW is so famous for on the subject of modern reality television and its ongoing evolution. The feeling of being painfully aware of what I wasn't getting to read was somewhat heightened by the fact that this collection isn't his best work, lacking as it does a transcendent anchor piece such as \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again.\" His essay on the economics of the US Open came closest for me, but I don't know that these pieces would have been pulled together in this way had he not died. This is not to say they are not good; on the contrary, I enjoyed all of them, especially his discussion of a prose poem anthology and his commentary on how he decided which essays to choose for a Best Of collection.

Desde la sublime y trascendental experiencia que supone observar el juego de Federer hasta la decadencia cinematogr\u00e1fica de Terminator 2 y lo que DFW llama 'el porno de efectos especiales', pasando por un fascinante compendio sobre el correcto uso de ciertas palabras en ingl\u00e9s, 'En cuerpo y en lo otro' nos brinda la impagable experiencia de interactuar de forma directa con los pensamientos de un aut\u00e9ntico l\u00edder generacional que contin\u00faa sirviendo de inspiraci\u00f3n a muchos, entre los que me incluyo, exigentes lectores."}, {"userName": "Corey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8386063-corey", "userReview": "SECOND \"READING\" (MARCH 2018): 3.5 STARSSearching for essays to teach in my freshman comp class next year, I've been listening to audiobooks of the DFW essays (if anyone's curious, I'm leaning towards \"Authority and American Usage,\" collected in CONSIDER THE LOBSTER). I didn't find much in the way of that here, but I enjoyed re-\"reading\" this collection nonetheless. It kind of pales in comparison to LOBSTER and A SUPPOSEDLY FUN THING--most of these essays are collected from Wallace's early days, when he hadn't yet fully come into himself as a writer. The AIDS essay is especially cringe-inducing. Still, the US Open essay is incredibly compelling, and \"Deciderization\" is an enormous pleasure--watching Wallace write an introduction to an essay anthology is like watching LeBron James or Jordan play around on one of those blue and yellow Fisher Price hoops. FIRST READING (APRIL 2016): 4 STARSThe main problem with reviewing this book is I regard David Foster Wallace as one of the best and most important writers of the last 100 or so years. Both his fiction and non-fiction achieve such an excellence that I never know, when something of Wallace's seems to me, for whatever reason, lacking, whether that's because it's simply inferior or whether my expectations of the work in question are raised to an impossibly high standard because, after all, this is the man who brought us Infinite Jest and Brief Interviews With Hideous Men and \"E Unibus Pluram.\" But assuming it's the latter (i.e., Wallace's work sometimes falls short of the impossibly high standard some of his other books achieve), and considering that this collection was published posthumously*, I think it's earned the full four stars it's received from me and not the 3.5 I was originally inclined to give it. Maybe. Or maybe Wallace is just one of my favorite writers, and his work has made such a tremendous impact on my life, that I have a soft-spot for him and will let him slide where other authors don't get a pass. So, with that being said, the other problem here is that I don't know how to review essay collections, especially when the collections aren't curated by the author, and, furthermore, when their curation seems to have no internal logic whatsoever, short of \"well, this stuff hasn't been published as a book yet, has it?\" With this in mind, I think the only way to do this review is to take you through my reactions to each of the different essays, culminating in some brief, concluding remarks that speak to my overall impression of the collection. \"And but so,\" without further ado:1) \"Federer Both Flesh and Not\" - A surprisingly insightful and moving essay about seeing Roger Federer play live. It certainly elicited a few chuckles from yours truly, and it's almost as good as the collection got.2) \"Fictional Futures of the Conspicuously Young\" - Perhaps the most scathing piece Wallace ever wrote (and this from the man who, in an earlier essay, once cited a \"friend\" who called John Updike \"a penis with a thesaurus\"). It is essentially, a much angrier and much less refined version of the seminal \"E Unibus Pluram.\" The anger and frustration Wallace has with some of his contemporaries leads him to make claims to the effect that television is making us so passive and stupid that consuming it at the rate we do will eventually cause us to devolve into a state of anomie and also, we'll somehow forget we're going to die? Not to mention that writers of commercial, pop fiction are like prostitutes and their readers are like johns. Yikes.3) \"The Empty Plenum\" - A book review of David Markson's \"Wittgenstein's Mistress.\" Certainly not worth reading if you don't have a pretty broad familiarity with Wittgenstein, and probably not worth reading if you haven't read W.M. The review turns into an essay that has more to do with Wallace's reading of the Tractatus than it does with Markson's novel, which might be okay, except that the prose is so dense it becomes almost a chore to read, and that's coming from somebody who's about to graduate with a B.A. in philosophy.4) \"Mr. Cogito\" - Another, albeit much briefer, review of some book of poems from the early 90s. I've never heard of it, but apparently Wallace was just crazy about it.5) \"Democracy and Commerce at the US Open\" - Not the best essay in this collection, IMO, but certainly in the running. Here Wallace reports to us from the 1995 US Open, where he has come to watch Roger Federer play. The result is a highly observational essay that, for readers who are familiar with Wallace's non-fiction, will call to mind previous essays like \"Shipping Out\" or \"Ticket to the Fair.\" In the hands of a lesser writer, this could have gone horribly awry, but Wallace's eyes and ears are so keen that every detail we're presented with comes vividly to life.6) \"Back in New Fire\" - In which Wallace takes all of five pages to explain to readers \"AIDS' gift to us,\" without once mentioning the disease's gay victims. It almost transcends repugnance by virtue of how utterly bizarre it is--in one essay in this same collection, Wallace speaks highly of the rise of Gadamer and the heremeneuts. Well, you do a hermeneutic interpretation of this straight white male, writing, in the late-90s, about how AIDS is going to save us from a certain fall from romance (or something).7) \"The (As It Were) Seminal Importance of Terminator 2\"- A total hatchet job of the Terminator sequel. Deliciously funny.8) \"The Nature of Fun\" - Probably the best account anywhere of what it's like to try and write fiction in any kind of serious and committed way. And done with astonishing brevity, too.9) \"Overlooked: Five Direly Unappreciated US Novels > 1960\" - Spoiler alert: WM makes an appearance again here.10) \"Rhetoric and Math Melodrama\" - I'm only just now noticing how a lot of these essays merely consist of Wallace pooh-poohing people. Add to the list of people he especially doesn't like novelists who write about mathematical formulas, some of which they've made up and don't explain.11) \"The Best of the Prose Poem\" - In which Wallace pooh-poohs prose poets, except for a select few that he likes.12) \"Twenty-Four Word Notes\" - In which Wallace pooh-poohs people who use certain words incorrectly via one-paragraph meditations on the usage of certain words. Some of these \"notes\" are more interesting than others. Some of the mis-used words in question Wallace brings up only to tell the reader that THOSE mis-usages are actually okay.13) \"Borges on the Couch\" - In which Wallace pooh-poohs literary biographies. Interesting in a certain metafictional way, given that \"Every Love Story is a Ghost Story,\" a literary biography of DFW, was published just a few years back.14) \"Deciderization 2007\" - Plenty of lol's to be found here. A pithy introduction to an essay anthology Wallace \"edited.\"15) \"Just Asking\" - A 2-page thing in which Wallace pooh-poohs the war on terror. One wonders what he'd make of the international affairs circa 2016.Overall impressions: Obviously, I wasn't enamored of the collection or anything, but it certainly had it's moments, and Wallace is endlessly funny, and the prose throughout is nothing short of incredible. Maybe the above is a little hard on DFW, but how could we expect any less of such a talented person?* Previous collections of Wallace's (i.e., those published when he was still alive) often featured already-published work, but usually the essays were in ship shape, because they appeared--in the collections--in vastly revised and unabridged form, leaving in stuff that turned out to be crucial to pared-down editions that were published for magazines."}, {"userName": "Celeste - Una stanza tutta per me", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46534583-celeste---una-stanza-tutta-per-me", "userReview": "Tra i migliori saggi di Wallace.

Wallace is the cult author of Infinite Jest (listed in 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die) and also an unfinished novel called The Pale King.Of course, I was never going to read an essay about Terminator 2 (which is a film I\u2019ve never seen) or the one about Roger Federer (who plays tennis) or about the US Open. But impressed by this author\u2019s reputation as a wordsmith, I flicked through the Table of Contents to see what I might like to read from this collection.I chose \u2018Rhetoric and the Math Melodrama\u2019 because the essay explores examples of \u2018math\u2019s new cachet\u2019 in the book world and I was familiar with some of the texts Wallace discussed. Written in 2000, the essay is about the emergence of books and film about heroes of the mathematical world, such as Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem by Amir D. Aczel (1996) or A Beautiful Mind\u2019 by Sylvia Nasar (1998) which inspired the film starring Russell Crowe. Wallace makes the point that to some extent these books depend on the reader having some understanding about higher maths. In this respect, he says, such books are like other kinds of genre fiction in that they tend to be assessed using evaluative criteria more rhetorical than that used for literary fiction. That is, rather than the critic asking \u2018is this piece of fiction good?\u2019 the reviewer of genre fiction asks \u2018to whom will this piece of fiction appeal?\u2019In other words, it\u2019s about the audience rather than the intrinsic qualities of the book. And with \u2018mathsy\u2019 books (that\u2019s my word, I just made it up) \u2018the precise ways in which they\u2019re not very good, will vary directly with how much the individual reader already knows about the extraordinary field\u2019 being dramatised. Higher maths, he says, is beautiful and interesting, but lots of people are scared off it by how hard it can be at the lower levels that one needs to work through in order to reach the pinnacle.Well, I\u2019m not about to argue with the likes of David Foster Wallace but I have to say that even though I didn\u2019t understand all the maths and science in Seduced by Logic, by Robyn Arianrhod, I still found it a very interesting book. Of course he could not have read this one because it was published only last year.But Wallace had also obviously never read Sue Woolfe\u2019s Leaning Towards Infinity (2000) either, (perhaps because books by Australian authors failed to attract his attention), but if he had he would surely have included it in his musings because it was a much better book than Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, and by the sound of them, the other books he discusses as well.The publisher has noted that Wallace used to like playing with words and so they have bookended each chapter with vocabulary that he used in the essays, (complete with definitions, of course). In \u2018Rhetoric and the Math Melodrama\u2019 I didn\u2019t actually find any that I had to look up.

In short, I'm trying to make abstraction of who David Foster Wallace is when reading him, although it's very difficult because he has a distinctive style and I usually have a blast reading him.BOTH FLESH AND NOT has some of his most accessible, and enjoyable essays including FICTIONAL FUTURES AND THE CONSPICUOUSLY YOUNG, THE NATURE OF THE FUN and BORGES ON THE COUCH. It might not be his most ambitious work, but at this point I don't really care. An essay collection is a proper goodbye for an author who gained a monstrous following through his self-aware personality and his immense, yet extremely democratic intellect.

Wallace's other non-fiction collections were meticulously curated and show him working at a delirious, fevered intellectual pitch; they also tended to be pieces he had written over the course of a few years in the early 90's or early 2000's. The real problem with Both Flesh and Not is that it extends that chronology all the way back to the 1980's through 2007 with work that, while engaging and funny and often quite insightful, often lacks the really flooring brilliance of his best non-fiction. \tIn fact several of the pieces in here, especially his literary reviews, come across as the work of a jealously insecure, though deeply erudite mind. It's not enough that he gushes about his love of Wittgenstein's Mistress (which really is phenomenally well done) he also has to write an eye-glazingly protracted piece that makes every conceivable effort to remind you of how thorough and total his own grasp of Wittgenstein/Analytic philosophy is (as though we ever doubted, or even cared). And in a review of 2 thoroughly unimpressive novels about mathematics, he seems interested not only in making it crystal clear that he is a more thoughtful novelist than either of the 2 aforementioned writers, but that he in fact has a much deeper and more profound understanding of higher mathematics than either of them either. In short, Wallace seems to become weirdly passive-aggressive whenever any novelist dares raise their head to write a book about any sort of idea or theme that he himself is personally interested in.\t And yet, there are pieces in here that are really gorgeously alive, in particular his essays about Tennis, which are so full of passion and delightful descriptions of Roger Federer, Andre Aggasi, Pete Sampras, et al. in action that they actually made me care about an organized, competitive athletic activity for probably the first time in my life.\tHowever, the later pieces here are hard to read. Not because they recall his impending demise, but simply because they are so heavily rooted in and dependent upon the cultural climate of the late Bush years (\"I'm the decider.\" \"Mission Accomplished\"\u2026 remember when that stuff was in the news)? And the simple fact is that as brilliant and as wide-ranging and as endlessly erudite as David Foster Wallace was, the America of 2014 is by many orders of magnitude more fraught with white noise and anxiety and vast economic woe than even he probably would have imagined if he was still around today. Wallace at his best was a deeply insightful writer and thinker, but 6 years after his death, I think we've already left him behind in the Big American Dread department.To use a silly pop-music metaphor, Both Flesh and Not is more like a reissue of some huge band's rarities and b-sides rather than a collection of their greatest hits. If you already love Wallace's other books, you will likely love some (though maybe not all) of these essays. If you've never read him or just never made it around to his non-fiction before, this probably isn't the best or strongest place to start from. You'd probably be better served by starting with \"Consider the Lobster,\" or \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll never do Again\""}, {"userName": "Oliver Twist & Shout", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5425403-oliver-twist-shout", "userReview": "A pesar que no deja de ser una especie de recopilaci\u00f3n de restos (o, dicho con finura, caras B) es un libro mucho m\u00e1s interesante y satisfactorio de lo esperado.
