LOL, how's that for an endorsement? One of the things I appreciated the most is Elliott's attention to historical detail. The whole book is seeped in history, but it doesn't bog the reader down. I especially enjoyed the references to the social niceties of the day. Useful bits of information like a lady making sure she stands four feet away from a gentleman for propriety's sake. It felt like I had been swept back in time! Love that feeling of complete escape!Kate's struggle to overcome her shyness is heart-breaking and Ben's empathy is so endearing! Together, the two already make an enthralling read but then Elliott throws in a riveting plot riddled with action and angst and emotional turmoil! Oh, my poor reader's heart! Let's just say I wept at the end. Great, big, heaving sobs.This is the kind of book that makes you feel and think and ponder long after you've finished the last page. The fact that it is based on real people and events makes it all the more compelling. Move this on to the top of your TBR pile!"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/369732-michelle", "userReview": "More like 4.5 stars...Sweeter than Birdsong had it's enjoyable moments, and there were even a few times when I was downright enthralled and didn't want to do anything but read this book. On the flip side, there were a few spots where I found myself skimming, but overall I thought the book was well-written and inspiring. I even liked it enough to put the first book in the series on my \"hope to read\" list, which is something I don't do often. I loved Ben's character and the adventure his family had as part of their ministry to the Underground Railroad and abolition movement. What spoke to my heart most in this novel was the passion that the characters had for abolition and the desire to put their own welfare at risk to save someone else. A few times I was afraid right along with them as they tried to help slaves escape to freedom, and that scene with Frank when he cried over his wife broke my heart. The description was so well-done I could hear his grief. I had a hard time liking Kate's family at all, but they did find a place in my heart at the end. Ben's family was great all along and such an encouragement to him. They seemed to be the kind of family most people wished they had.The romantic elements in the story were interesting. I liked how Kate was portrayed as extremely shy, which makes her overcoming the fear of speaking more powerful when it finally happens. At first I could not see the appeal of why Ben would continue to pursue Kate even though they bonded during that one risky mission. But she avoided him in obedience to her mother's wishes. I wanted to say, \"scrap what your mother wants and do what you want, you're an adult\" but then realized the constraints at the time made that difficult to do. I understood her mother's motivation to keep her from marrying what she perceived as the \"wrong man\" for her future. The one thing that struck me about this story was how even the littlest of touches, like a quick brush of the hands, could be sensual if that was the only contact you had with the opposite sex that you happened to be very attracted to. Simple things took on a lot more meaning. That was well done. I thought the author did a great job trying to build the romantic tension. The letters really added to the story. All in all, a good read. I enjoyed this author's style and will probably read her books again."}, {"userName": "Casey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3194216-casey", "userReview": "\u201cSweeter than Birdsong\u201d weaves emotions, our nation\u2019s greatest tragedy and characters that long to stand up for what\u2019s right.I think I felt the most connection with Kate. Though I have never been one to struggle with being shy or afraid to speak publically, I can understand that debilitating fear that can take over you. Her gentle growth through the story was absolutely perfect and I had to cheer when she stood up for something she believed in and was passionate about. The fact that the novel is based on real characters and things that actually happened, made Ben seem larger than life on the page. Be sure and read the historical footnote at the end of the novel. It gives such an appreciation for all they did in their lifetime.The pre Civil War era is one of my favorites. Helping slaves escape to freedom, fighting for what\u2019s right, valiance and despair. Hope and romance. There is little bit of everything wrapped up in this novel. If I were to compare the first and second novels in the series, then I still prefer the first of the two. At times the plot seemed a bit languid, but when you step back and look at the story I could only appreciate the tapestry and layers spread the entire book.This review is my honest opinion.

This time we jump ahead to 1855 in Ohio with the protagonists of that book still playing an important role in anti-slavery efforts including aiding fugitive slaves in defiance of the Fugitive Slave Act and writing an anti-slavery song that ends up being compared to Uncle Tom's Cabin in terms of impact. So it's pretty exciting for a history nerd to read about these events on the brink of the Civil War (including several characters predicting that the country can't hold).My big disappointment with Fairer Than Morning was expecting more of a romance than I got. I only remembered that when I reread my review so I didn't really have expectations when reading this book. Happily I thought there was a bit more romance although it was definitely of a slow-burning quiet kind as both participants need to conduct themselves by the codes of society. What we got was very sweet and made me very happy :)The male is Ben Hanby, son of Fairer Than Morning's love story, musical genius, and committed to a future in the clergy. The only thing dissuading him from that potential future is the lovely Kate Winter, one of the first female students at Otterbein College, whose society mama has higher expectations than a future pastor. Kate's shyness and awful family life, meanwhile, have her plotting escape until an encounter with a runaway slave jolts her from her plans.I did think there could have been more about Kate's family life. Her father's a drunk, her mother regrets her decision to leave Philadelphia society, and her younger sister has been emotionally scarred by their toxic home but while the mother's thoughts and feelings are partially explained, the other two are not really talked about. Since Kate's home is so formative to her character, I think it would have been good to have more insight into it.I thought the historical elements were very well done. I'm not too familiar with the time period but the way that slavery was woven into the story was fantastic. Some of the most exciting and tense passages revolved around fugitives and the simmering conflict among Americans is well-emphasized. I thought the Christian aspect was also well-done. I would definitely not describe it as preachy but instead it was very well-incorporated and sprang organically from the characters themselves.Overall: An intense historical read about a time period that doesn't always get much attention.Cover: Hmm, I don't know. I like the hoop skirt (crinolines get a good shout-out in the book) but it doesn't entirely click for me. It's not bad but it's not great to me."}, {"userName": "Margaret Chind", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226769-margaret-chind", "userReview": "The bulk of reviews are in for this new release to a fairly new author and the opinions are high! The cover is the first thing that grips me for this novel as it tells so much a story on it's own. Interestingly the heroine in this novel has a different personality than I find myself used to in reading Christian Historical settings, but it's intriguing. Part of it is odd to me, because by the descriptions it seems as if she has always had the anxiety disorder, but is only recently trying to overcome it but... for her to have gotten to her current age and progressed as far as she has at the college wouldn't she have had to overcome some of her shyness and anxiety before hand? That just threw me a bit - however her reasons for being so are definitely one that would affect a person's personality!Throughout every page I can tell that this one is well researched. The descriptions really allow your imagination to fly back in time. All the characters and their issues are real and rough and show through to a reality once known and in someways still there.

As the first woman to graduate from Otterbein College, she\u2019ll be guaranteed her deepest wish: escape from the dark secret haunting her family.

Then he hears her sing-and the glory of her voice moves him as never before. He determines to cast her in his musical and uncover the mystery that is Kate. Still, he must keep his own secret to himself. Not even this intriguing woman can know that his passionate faith is driving him to aid fugitives on the Underground Railroad.A terrifying accident brings Kate and Ben together, but threatens to shatter both their secrets and their dreams. Kate can no longer deny the need to find her courage-and her voice-if she is to sing a new song for their future.In \u201cSweeter than Birdsong\u201d Rosslyn Elliott not only gives us a great romance but a real piece of history. While her work is fiction this book is based on the lives of a real Ben and Kate who went through much of the events depicted in the story. This story has such great themes, slavery, how to do good when evil abounds, true love and how God works His plans even in the midst of great suffering. I like history and any story that has something to do with The Underground Railroad is a winner in my book. On top of all of that \u201cSweeter than Birdsong\u201d has real life John Parker as one of the characters and you have to read this book to know more about him. I guarantee you will be delighted.

I am going to warn you now though that I almost gave this book a 4, because parts of it were so extremely sad, but after time away from the book, I am ready to give it a 5, because of how inspiring it was and great message that it conveys. I totally relate to Kate Winters! As a student at the top of her class at the beginning, she was so shy and afraid to speak in front of her College class. I am the same way! I loved the journey she went through throughout the book, growing into a new person with the help of Ben Hanby. The Historical aspect of this book was also amazing. It was great to read a book about the Underground Railroad and how some people, despite the danger, risked their lives for the freedom of slaves. I have never understood how anyone could treat people in the cruel ways that slave owners treated their slaves. It was unjust and not right in any way. I have always hoped that I would have had the courage to stand up for what I believed in if faced with a situation like that. Ben Hanby was an amazing character as well. He and his family were real people, and really were involved in helping slaves gain freedom via the underground railroad. I loved how he was so determined to write his song and do justice to the reason he was writing it (I can't say why, because that would be a spoiler), and how he and his family were all so kind and determined to help those in need.Ben and Kate were such a good couple! It was nice how they talked and helped each other get through things even though their circumstances were against them. The way Kate's parents acted, especially at the beginning was really sad, especially since I don't know what I would do without my wonderful parents. The only problem I had with this book I can't say without it being a huge spoiler, but I understand why it had to be that way. Ben never would have written his song to that effect if it hadn't, though it was extremely sad (I cried a lot, not tears I could hide either).Don't let this stop you from reading it though, because it was one of the MOST INSPIRING BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!One of the things that Nelly, one of the slaves they were helping escape, said was truly inspiring, and so perfect for that time. \"Up there where no one can catch him, he sings that freedom song.\" I also love the part at the end when Kate truly stands up for what she believed in.Rosslyn Elliot did a truly fantastic job writing this book. The writing was fantastic, interesting, and completely well done.THESE CHARACTERS TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!

I haven\u2019t read the first book in the series Fairer than Morning (although I would like to), but that didn\u2019t seem to matter, because the author fills the reader in where it is needed.Kate Winter's dreams of being one of the first women to graduate from Otterbein College, but she thinks this dream is lost when her fear of public speaking causes her to flee the classroom when it is her turn for oration. Another of her dreams is to make a new home for her sister Leah, somewhere safe. A place where their father can\u2019t hurt them, and her mother\u2019s words won\u2019t tear them down. Kate and Ben are classmates and friends, and at Ben\u2019s request Kate reluctantly joins the musicale that he is producing. When Kate\u2019s friend, Cornelia Lawrence is scheduled to play at Neil House in Columbus, Mrs. Lawrence invites her to join them and the Hanby\u2019s for their trip. Kate decides that this would be a good time to find a place for her and Leah to go. Little did she know that she would be so changed by the trip, as she helps the Hanby\u2019s as they try to lead some slaves toward freedom.Rosslyn\u2019s writing is powerful, and draws the reader into the story. I loved the way Kate and Ben\u2019s story leapt off the page. The scenes, sounds and characters came alive and also becomes a part of the reader. I will choose to read other books by this author, but look forward to the next book in this series, if there is one, and I hope there is, because I closed the book wanting to read more about Kate and Ben.This story is based on the true accounts of Kate Winter and Ben Hanby.

And since it wasn\u2019t long ago that I read the first in the series, Fairer than Morning, all the characters were fresh in my mind, and I loved watching their offspring\u2019s grow and mature. While I have to say that, out of the two, I liked the first one better, Sweeter Than Birdsong was a lovely addition to the story and a very \u2018sweet\u2019 read.Kate Winter intrigued me immediately because of her shyness and fear of speaking in public. Since I would rather not give speeches in front of a crowd either, I could relate\u2014though she was more extreme then I! Ben Hanby, of course, drew my attention before he was the eldest son of Will and Ann (from Fairer Than Morning). Out of these two loveable characters, I enjoyed watching Kate grow the most throughout Sweeter Than Birdsong.As Kate sees the plights of other slaves, I loved watching her view of life changed\u2014no longer did she see her life as unbearable, for she\u2019d seen what was truly \u2018unbearable\u2019 through her rescue attempt of a slave. She grew so much throughout the book, there is an obvious night and day difference from when we first met Kate (attempting to give a speech) and when we leave Kate (singing Ben\u2019s song in front of a large audience).Rosslyn Elliott kept all the characters within Sweeter than Birdsong so real and vivid, that I, as the reader, found that I could relate to them on a few different levels. Doesn\u2019t everyone desire to make their mark on the world? But, just as Ben realized, sometimes we need to leave it in God\u2019s hand, and trust Him to open people\u2019s minds and hearts.I am looking forward to the next installment to this series, and to see where Elliott takes the Hanbys.

Kate is a realistic character, which anyone ever suffering from shyness can identify with. Ben is a real charmer, kind and caring and passionate for his beliefs, which at times get him into a lot of trouble.

There were also times though, especially in the beginning, that I found myself skipping some of the unnecessary details. I would have probably given this book 5 stars if there was about 50-100 pages shorter but I do understand why some of the lengthier details were included.I really enjoyed both main characters Ben and Kate. Kate reminds me a lot of myself, I am deathly afraid of talking in front of people to the point of panic attacks when I know I have to be in front of a group. Her fear was displayed in a way that it reminded me of my own. I loved how she grows and develops though in to a character that takes her fears head on and is determined to fight for justice. Ben was beyond a wonderful character!! His gift of music is amazing and the way he tries to help others realize their gifts from God were delightful. This novel was based off of real characters and real events that happened which is what makes this story even better! You walk away with so much admiration for the people that fought against slavery in our country.I\u2019ve read a few Civil War era books but this was the first book that I read about helping slaves escapes to freedom and I have to say that part of the story just came alive in this book. I felt my own heart just hurting for the women slave in the story. The fact that there is light at the end of this sorrow and romance to keep it all going made this novel even better!I read the first book in this series and I think I preferred that one just a bit more than this one but I still am thankful that I read Sweeter than Birdsong and I will be continuing reading more from this great author.

Actually it wasn't even a subject in school that I much liked. But if written into a book such as Sweeter Than Birdsong and I will read with excitement. Maybe due to how it is written or just the fact that I am not necessarily suppose to learn something.Rosslyn Elliott's writing has a way of putting you right into the story. Her building of her characters are such that you could find yourself in any one of them. They are down to earth with everyday life experiences. Yes they lived back in 1855, and life was different than today in someways. But life still has the same kinds of decisions to make.Kate Winters is what some would call shy.

Set in Ohio a few years before the beginning of the Civil War, book two in the trilogy features Ben Hanby, son of Will and Ann Hanby, whom we met when the series first began. Ben is the musical mastermind of Otterbein College, as passionate about music as he is about helping folks find freedom through the Underground Railroad. Kate Winter is lovely, painfully shy, and determined to escape her mother's plan to marry her daughter off to a wealthy man. Kate is gifted with a beautiful voice, one that strikes a deep chord in Ben's mind and soul. He wants her to star in his musical production, and he looks forward to getting to know the real Kate. She sees his offer as a chance to foil her mother's scheme and she gathers her courage to reach out for personal freedom. While Kate suffers from anxiety over interactions with the public, she is happy and comfortable with the company of her horse, and she learns to perform daring feats on horseback which give her a new confidence. Ben works to find success as a songwriter, even as he secretly works with the Underground Railroad. When Kate and Ben are drawn together in the rescue of a young enslaved family, their lives are forever changed, and Kate begins to overcome her personal doubts. With \"Sweeter Than Birdsong\", author Rosslyn Elliott once again provides enthralling historical detail, rich written imagery, and a sweetly poignant romance. This type of superb storytelling is what historical romance lovers live for. It's what makes us devotees of this genre. Highly recommended. The third book in the series, \"Lovelier Than Daylight\", is scheduled for a late 2012 release.

She's set on escaping to freedom from the secret pains her family brings, a controlling mother and a drunken father. Ben Hanby, a young man anticipating becoming a minister, has a secret of his own. Just as his parents before him, he desires to aid fugitive slaves to escape through the Underground Railroad. Ben and Kate's relationship quickly moves from college acquaintances to family friends, and through circumstances beyond her control, Kate finds herself helping others on their journey to freedom. It causes her to take a good, hard look at her own life and wonder if she really needs to escape after all.This book had plenty to hold my interest. I'm fascinated with stories about slaves escaping to freedom and learning what kind of hardships they overcame to gain freedom. I also enjoy stories with characters who endure tough times and grapple with who they are, then experience a change after gaining a different perspective on life.This is historical fiction and romance. It contains a fair amount of romance, which isn't my first choice in genre, but I still enjoyed the book very much. It also had a bit of suspense thrown in, which I always love in a story. The author includes the historical information at the end of the book, which I always appreciate. Although this is the second book in The Saddler's Legacy, you don't need to read the first in the series to enjoy this book. It does fine as a stand-alone novel.I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze\u00ae.com book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review.

This is the first novel I've ever read by Rosslyn Elliott, and I have to say, she's probably just become one of my favorite writers. Aside from excellent writing, she's taken a story that is based on real-life people, and woven it into a tale that will hold readers captive--which is not easy with true stories. Rosslyn Elliott takes names found on the dusty pages of history books and breaths life back into them, forever inscribing their names into the hearts and minds her readers. I can now add a few more names to my People I admire list. This story is so rich in historical detail that I felt like I had been transported back in time.Not only is it rich in detail, but the subjects of slavery and women's rights are delt with in such a way that it's not overbearing, but enough to make a profound impact on the reader. I've been raised in the south, where people have always tried to justify slavery. Between the modern abolition movement taking place today and reading this book, I've come to realize there is never, ever any justification of any type of slavery. This book words it in such a way that it exposes the greed behind the slavery that took place. It's amazing how every element in this story comes together to create a flawless experience for the reader. Any review I write will probably do this book injustice. All I can say is that you need to read Sweeter Than Birdsong for yourself. I received a complimentary copy of this novel from Litfuse Publicity and Thomas Nelson in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1642306-dawn", "userReview": "Kate Winter has her heart set on graduating from Otterbein College in Westerville, Ohio. The problem - she is terrified of speaking in front of others. She knows she can be free of her family and her mother's determination to marry her off to a wealthy man. Despite her fear, she agrees to sing in the musicale production that fellow student Ben Hanby, a musical genius, is directing. Ben's also got a secret - he works for the Underground Railroad. When an accident force Ben and Kate to work together, both of their secrets are threatened. Somehow, Kate must find the courage to sing a song of freedom.This is the second book in the Saddler's Legacy Series by Rosslyn Elliot. Set in the years prior to the Civil War, I was drawn into the story and the historic Underground Railroad. Freedom is a theme I found in the book. What is the price of freedom? For the slaves, it's quite possibly their own lives? For Kate and Ben, it's the willingness to go and do whatever it is that God calls them to do. Being based upon a real life family, the Hanbys, I enjoyed being able to get into their world and to read some about them. I love the time period of the Civil War. The drama of the Underground Railroad and feeling the emotions that the slaves, Ben, Kate, his mother, and others had while attempting to shelter the passengers gave me a new impression of the time period. I've never had to live in fear like the slaves. This is an excellent book, and I'm delighted to have read it.Rating - 5 starsI received this book for free from Thomas Nelson's booksneeze program for the purpose of reviewing.

While some characters are trapped by fear and others are in literal bondage, this book explores the preciousness of hard-won freedom in all its grandeur.Ben Hanby is a fine, generally self-assured young man who faces challenges head-on, whether they come in the form of physical flight (and fights) or in the form of assisting and wooing a bright but insecure young woman. But while he hardly seems lacking, he discovers that he, too, has things to learn on his journeys with Kate - lessons in patience, as well as gaining confidence in being the person he is called to be in God regardless of the opinions of others.Kate Winter is an especially wonderful character to observe. She grows so much throughout the story! When she is first introduced, a trip to the podium to give a speech in front of her classmates seems too much of an adventure for her. But her adventures are just beginning, as her interactions with Ben and his family land her in some unlikely and challenging situations.While Kate Winter's blossoming is sometimes a slow process, the story is told well and culminates into a thing of beauty. Sweeter Than Birdsong is historical fiction with heart and an underlying passion that beats a steady rhythm of growth throughout the novel.*With thanks to the publisher for providing me with an ARC of the book in exchange for my honest opinion, to be shared during the Litfuse Publicity Blogging tour.*"}], "description": "Music offers Kate sweet refuge from her troubles...But real freedom is sweeter.In Westerville, Ohio, 1855, Kate Winter's dreams are almost within reach.
