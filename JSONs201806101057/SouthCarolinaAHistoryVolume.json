Read by the author. Enjoyed this so much during my commute to and from work (from Beaufort to Bluffton) during my first year as a new resident of the Palmetto state. Very informative, interesting and absorbing."}], "description": "In this two-volume, thirty CD set, South Carolina's leading historian Walter Edgar presents a sweeping narrative of a state with an illustrious, sometimes infamous, past. He describes in very human terms 475 years of recorded history in the Palmetto State, including the experiences of all South Carolinians--rich and poor, male and female, those with roots in Africa and in Europe as well as Native Americans. In an eminently readable presentation, Edgar uses letters, diaries, and other writings to let voices from the past take part in telling the state's fascinating story. Volume 2 (discs 16 to 30) explores the Civil War period to the present day. The audio edition of South Carolina: A History is a project of South Carolina Educational Communications, South Carolina Educational Radio, and the University of South Carolina Press. Walter Edgar's recordings were made possible by grants from the Stringer Foundation and the Callie and John Rainey Foundation.", "title": "South Carolina: A History, Volume 2", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14518730-south-carolina", "average": 5.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1340789981l/14518730.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/483084.Walter_Edgar", "name": "Walter Edgar"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14518730-south-carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/951734.South_Carolina_a_History", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1056100.Partisans_and_Redcoats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25708949-conversations-with-the-conroys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/951733.The_South_Carolina_Encyclopedia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25708938-conversations-with-the-conroys"]}
