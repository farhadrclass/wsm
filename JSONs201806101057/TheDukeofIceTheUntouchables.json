I have not hated a hero as much as I hated Nick in quite a long time. Yes, he has some pain in his past. However, everyone has their own cross to bear. I do not believe there is a single person on this earth that does not carry some burden or another. Nick wields his pain like a weapon and an excuse to be an enormous jerk to everyone. I knew his story and yet I couldn't connect. Violet (the heroine) and Simon (Nick's best friend and The Duke of Ruin) had more painful pasts, which Nick was aware of, and yet at every turn he acts like a selfish ass and actually adds to their pain. I have a tough time connecting to heroes like this. To many, if the hero grovels at the end, then it is an emotional journey, but not me. No amount of groveling would ever redeem Nick.I also didn't like most of the secondary characters. In particular, there was the old biddies who had a ton of page time and were just plain awful. I also didn't care for Violet's friend Hannah who was unbelievably shallow and only obsessed with her house party. She also blabbed about the heroine's secrets which I found unforgivable.Finally, I didn't like the plot. This is a personal preference of mine and is not Burke's fault. She executed it well and the pacing was solid, I just didn't care for it. I really don't care for stories where the hero and heroine are at odds the entire book. And I certainly don't like it when the hero is all \"I'll never marry for love so I won't be with the heroine, but I'll consider marrying another woman instead.\" This book has a lot of tension and emotional pull...if you are into it. Since I couldn't connect to the hero, this plot didn't grab me.

The Duke of Ice is about facing fears and owning up to mistakes. Life's greatest fear is of the unknown. Things we can't control, but always weigh on our minds. Ms. Burke always creates great characters, but for me Nick proved to be breathtaking. The tortured soul with so much love to give, but a ton of guilt to bear. My heart broke for him. Love should be a beautiful adventure, but for him it seemed to be the beginning of something much darker. A lifetime of pain. Violet was the light at the end of the tunnel. She was the key to a mystery years in the making. All he has to do is trust his heart and open his soul. Darcy Burke went in an unexpected direction, but delivered one of her most human tales to date. Violet and Nick will leave readers breathless."}, {"userName": "Barbara Rogers", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44824289-barbara-rogers", "userReview": "Series: The Untouchables #7Publication Date: 12/26/17This has been and is a wonderful series \u2013 I have thoroughly enjoyed every book in the series and anxiously await each new addition. However, I do have to say that this has been my least favorite so far. I tried and tried and tried and just never could warm up to Nick. I know he\u2019s had a lot of pain in his life but his total abdication of responsibilities at the end just kept me from getting that happy glow \u2013 it is also why I have given a 4-star rather than a 5-star review. I believe it tells you something about the hero when you feel the real hero of the book is Simon and you fervently wished Simon and the heroine would get together. Both Violet and Simon have much worse issues in their life and yet they are still nice people. Nick seems to use his past as a weapon to be hateful to everyone around him.This is a book of juxtapositions \u2013 fire and ice, love and hate, loyalty and disloyalty, cowardice and heroism \u2013 as well as second chances. Can two flawed people find their way back to each other?Nicholas Bateman was never in line to become the Duke of Kilve. A lot of people had to die before that could happen and Nick mourned each and every one of them \u2013 most particularly, he mourned his brother Maurice who died at Badajoz. Then, after inheriting the title he lost his wife and child. He felt everyone he cared about died, so it was better to just not care \u2013 therefore, he became the Duke of Ice. He built a wall around himself, never letting anyone in \u2013 except his best (and only) friend Simon, the Duke of Romsey (aka Duke of Ruin).Violet, Lady Pendleton, was forced to marry a Viscount she didn\u2019t love to further her parent\u2019s ambitions. They spirited her off from Bath to London to keep her from marrying the man she truly loved with all her heart. He was a sweet, happy, smiling, charming young man but he had no title. Her parents wouldn\u2019t even let her say goodbye. She endured several years of living with a cruel, philandering husband before he finally sickened and died. Violet returned to Bath to live and has no plans to ever remarry \u2013 and she sees her parents as little as possible.Nicholas and Violet have a history. He was the man she loved and had wanted to marry. She wrote him a letter when she had to leave Bath, but he never got it. So, he has hated her all these years and blamed her for leaving him for a title. Imagine her surprise \u2013 and his \u2013 when they attend the same house party. Violet was there because the party was given by her best friend and Nick was there because Simon had begged and cajoled him into attending.Violet and Nicholas do spend some time talking at the party and get to know each other at least a little bit. Enough so that Nick decides to travel to Bath to further renew their acquaintance \u2013 to see if anything of their former relationship can be salvaged. Even though they have a physical relationship, he still can\u2019t make up his mind about marriage. Then, when she gets into an accident and almost dies, he shows his true cowardice and takes off for London.In London, he really gets himself into a mess that, frankly, I would just as soon he didn\u2019t escape. He certainly deserved what he had gotten himself into. Leave it to sweet Simon to clean up Nick\u2019s leavings. When Nick left without cleaning up any of his own mess and left it all to Simon, that was it for me, I was done with him and he was un-redeemable from then on.Nick and Violet get a sweet epilogue that was one of my favorite parts of the book. You\u2019ll just have to read the book!The next book is Simon\u2019s story and I am really looking forward to it. However, I\u2019m concerned that I\u2019ll dislike his heroine as much as I disliked Nick in this book. It will be interesting to see how Ms. Burke treats Miss Kingman. I didn\u2019t dislike her and suspect that there are scars under that cool demeanor.Please check out my reviews at:Blog: https://flippinpages.blog/Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/flippinpages...Twitter: https://twitter.com/FlippinPagesRevTwitter: https://twitter.com/BarbBookReview\u201cI requested and received this e-book at no cost to me and volunteered to read it; my review is my honest opinion and given without any influence by the author or publisher.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Tracy DeNeal", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66484903-tracy-deneal", "userReview": "Nicholas and Violet My first book of the year!!!! What an awesome start. Darcy Burke has succeeded in creating a wholly distasteful hero. His snarling, snappish behavior toward all in his orbit created such an aura of dislike. But yet...Violet, Lady Pendleton was such a sympathetic heroine. In spite of her short, detestable and entirely unhappy marriage, she has emerged mostly unscathed and genuinely a good and happy person. An odd house party at the home of her best friend unwittingly throws the Duke of Ice into her path. Together with the duke's best friend, she endeavors to thaw his chilly persona while also surreptitiously attempting to aid his friend in rehabilitating his own tarnished reputation. There is, as usual, more to the Duke of Ice than meets the eye. He has locked his heart up tight. Mistakes will be made. Feelings will be bruised. But in the end, this is a romance and true love will prevail. Thus, I have quite thoroughly enjoyed my first HEA of the year and I am well pleased. I cannot wait to enjoy Simon and Diana's story this spring!"}, {"userName": "Edwina \" I LoveBooks\" \"Deb\"", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6255709-edwina-i-lovebooks-deb", "userReview": "The Duke of Ice is my least favorite Untouchable story. I almost gave it 2 stars but the ending help elevate it to 3 stars.After a series of deaths in his family and much lost Nicholas Bateman becomes the 10th Duke of Kilve. Losing his wife and son was the final straw for Nick so he builds a walls of Ice around his heart and lives a solidary life not attending the normal functions of a Duke. He has only one friend and that is Simon The Duke of Romsey. Simon convinced Nick to attend a House Party where he encounters his long lost love Violet. Who eight years ago dumped him to marry a Viscount Pendleton. Nick was only a Mr. then. But it was Violet's parents who made her marry the Viscount. Nick can't forgive her for this. Nick realizes he is and always will be in love with Violet. Violet never stopped loving Nick and was force to marry Viscount Pendleton 8 years ago. OK my problem with the story is I am sick of The Spinister Widow characterization who thinks she is barren. I also, didn't like the fact that once Violet and Nick had reconnected sexually and what seemed to be lovingly that he goes off and Proposes marriage to Dianna Kingman. A young lady Nick and Violet met at the Linford House Party. This was really ridiclous. The reason is he won't marry Violet because he loves her and everyone he loves dies. So He Propose Marriage to someone he barely know and doesn't love to protect his feelings. What a waste of story. Dissappointing story since I loved so many other stories in The Untouchable series.

Caulfield, they were madly in love and wanted to marry. Violet was happier than she had ever been and couldn\u2019t wait to tell her parents, but when they learned of her love, they swept her off to London and married her off. She left Nick a letter, but he never received it and just believed that Violet threw him over for a title.Years pass and Nick has lost everyone in his life who means something to him, save his friend Simon, the Duke of Romsey aka the Duke of Ruin and Violet, the woman who he once loved, but now hates. Nick has shut himself off from the world and (for lack of a better word) wallows in his losses.Simon shows up at his estate and talks him into attending a house party with him. Simon is also a recluse \u2013 but not by choice and he was invited to the party, but the hostess has made it plain that she expects Nick to attend with Simon.Nick has no desire to go, but he agrees to go as a favor to Simon. They arrive and he is shocked and angry when he sees Violet among the guests.Now a widow, Violet is stunned to see Nick and can\u2019t believe people call him the Duke of Ice \u2013 the Nick she knew was farthest thing from ice she could imagine. Violet has survived a very unhappy marriage and regrets hurting Nick. She still loves him and hopes to make amends. But her hopes are dashed when Nick snubs her and makes it clear that he hates her.But when Simon is treated poorly, Violet comes to his defense and Nick grudgingly begins to rethink his feeling about her. They talk and he learns what really happened all those years ago, but he steels his heart against deeper feelings for her \u2013 Nick has lost everyone he loves and though he has spent years harboring hate for her \u2013 he can\u2019t lose her too. They plot together to have the other guests accept Simon and Nick realizes his true feelings for Violet, but he steadfastly refuses to consider her for marriage. But this outing has made him realize that he is lonely and maybe he could find another wife, one who won\u2019t expect love. He finds a candidate at the house party, Diana Kingman, and seriously begins to consider her despite his feeling for Violet. But when Simon is cast in a bad light and leaves an outing, Nick follows him. Simon tells Nick he is a fool to walk away from Violet and leaves.Nick returns home and after much consideration, travels to Bath to see Violet. He is still not willing to wed her, but he wants to see if they can recapture the past. Things progress between them and they become lovers. Violet hopes that Nick can put the past behind him and look to a future where they can be happy together. And it seems like Nick might be coming around, but when tragedy strikes the nation, Nick is dragged back into darkness and when he learns that Violet has been in an accident and it is not certain if she will live, he rushes to her side. But once it becomes clear that she will survive, he panics and bolts.Once in London, Nick becomes reacquainted with Diana and though he knows he loves Violet with all his heart, he comes to an agreement with Diana and finds himself engaged to her. Almost immediately he knows he has made a mistake, but there is no way to undo what has been done without ruining Diana. Violet is hurt when she awakens and learns that Nick has left her and she is heartbroken when she receives his letter telling her he feels they would not suit and of his upcoming marriage to Diana Kingman. Violet doesn\u2019t understand what went wrong, but knows that she loves Nick and will never love another.When Simon returns to London and learns that Nick is engaged to Miss. Kingman, he confronts Nick. Nick admits that he loves Violet and that after her accident he was terrified that his \u201ccurse\u201d was the reason for her accident and left her. Simon tells him he is an idiot and that Nick must make this right. Nick wants to go to Violet, but he is honor bound to Miss. Kingman. Simon tells Nick that he will take care of Miss. Kingman and that Nick should go to Violet.Nick returns to Bath and hopes to set things right with Violet, but she is having none of it. She loves Nick but she refuses to have her heart crushed by him again. Nick has his work cut out for him convincing Violet that he loves her and that he is ready to face his fears and forge a future with her.Personally, I think Violet forgave too easily, but Nick did grovel better than most heroes, so I forgive her.This book was most definitely my favorite in the series (so far), it is a well written, incredibly emotional book that grabs you from the first page and holds you captive until the last word. The love scenes are steamy, the secondary characters are wonderful, and the ending is extremely satisfying. I loved this book and would highly recommend it \u2013 it is the seventh book in the series, but it could easily be read as a standalone title.*I am voluntarily leaving a review for an eARC that was provided to me*"}, {"userName": "Sissy's Romance Book Review ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1831318-sissy-s-romance-book-review", "userReview": "THE DUKE OF ICE\u200b by Darcy Burke is book Seven in \"The Untouchables\" series.

It's there, where he runs into the one woman that he loved, Violet Caulfield, who left him to marry a Viscount.

I used to read historical romances all the time, as they were my favorite genre, but it's been a couple of years since I've read one. And this is the first book that I've read by Darcy Burke, and her talented writing style reminded me what I've been missing, as I couldn't get enough! Violet was a fantastic heroine, who was feisty & kind, but Nick had me wanting to junk punch him so many times. He was a beast most of the story, and yes, I know he went through terrible times, but his buddy, Ruin, had as well, and he didn't treat people so callously, so I'm not sure that I've forgiven him yet. And the cast of secondaries were colorful to say the least, as they kept the drama going. Add in a few twists & turns to keep me singing colorful metaphors in anger, while making the angst levels go up higher, and it had all of my emotions out to play.

Simon has brought an invitation to a house party; while Nick is content to wallow in his solitude, Simon is desperate to go out. Simon\u2019s reputation has never recovered from the malicious gossip since the death of his wife, and has earned him the unsavoury moniker of The Duke of Ruin. If Nick goes to the affair, Simon will be able to accompany him; and Simon does want to remarry, if someone will have him, unlike Nick, THE DUKE OF ICE, who has settled in his lonely widowhood. Nick relents, but tells Simon he will leave as soon as he can. Their hosts, Irving and Hannah Linford invited them because Hannah knows that dukes, even ones with a much tarnished veneer, will give some \u00e9clat to her party and elevate her social status. Hannah is also Lady Violet Pendleton\u2019s best friend, but what Hannah didn\u2019t know is that Violet and Nick were once lovers.Darcy Burke has struck gold again with this seventh instalment of The Untouchables, which can all be read as standalones, and THE DUKE OF ICE is another must-read from this fabulous author. Ms. Burke has created such compelling characters that I never disliked Nick, who is at times truly disagreeable and even rude. I felt sad for him because he has experienced so many painful losses, among them Violet\u2019s marriage to another man. Nick is nearly a hermit, and I wholeheartedly agreed with Simon that he ought to do something about his sorry excuse for a life. Violet didn\u2019t have it much easier, she has never stopped loving Nick, but she doesn\u2019t like THE DUKE OF ICE that he has become. I adored Nick and Violet, as well as the fabulous Simon; all three are coping with their losses as best as they can, but in very different ways, which was one of the many highlights of this book. Even secondary characters are splendid: the terrifying old gossips, Lady Nixon and Mrs. Law; Cassie and Andy; the young Diana, Lavinia, and the terrific and most intriguing Sarah.The writing is a marvel of smooth elegance, and the dialogues are superb, especially between Simon and Nick. I loved how Darcy Burke utilised the various games and entertainment at the party to advance the plot; the segment featuring the archery contest was particularly well done. Nick\u2019s epiphany left me breathless and teary-eyed, and those moments where the present meets the pasts are brilliant, and so moving. THE DUKE OF ICE is an incredibly emotional story; there was a lot of drama I did not expect, and I dare anyone to stop reading once the second half gets under way, because this is intense!

This is my first in this series of Darcy Burke\u2019s I have read and it won\u2019t be the last. Her writing enraptures you in the story. And Nicholas and Simon really capture your heart.Simon poor guy feels so much guilt and loss but he is ready to move on and find someone to spend his life with. Only his rumour is hurting him. When he gets a invite to a house party, he grabs the opportunity and gets his friend to agree as well. Who is his friend and why is it so hard to do?It\u2019s Nicholas of course and he is definitely the Duke of Ice. He has walled off his heart for fear of losing another he cares about. Simon is stubborn and ignores Nicholas\u2019s attitude. Nicholas is a nice guy who has hardened due to so many losses. It began with Violet and how she walked away and took his heart and continued with his family and loved ones. Now he is gruff, cold and very anti-social instead of what he once was charming. Simon gets him to the party but how does it go?Not so great at first. Nicholas really shows his reputation. He is very cold to others. Gruff and borderline rude. it intrigues others and his friend is so upbeat and kind. Things change though when Violet shows up.Violet who hurt him. Violet who ran away with his heart. He is flummoxed by this and icier than normal. Slowly though he thaws to violet and they team up to help Simon. Only Simon isn\u2019t the one who falls in love once more. Nicholas is. He slowly loses his icy exterior and when him and Violet meet after the party wowza. Those two explore their attraction and feelings.Once again though Nicholas believes the curse is rearing it\u2019s ugly head and he pushes away. Fearful of losing his heart forever. He doesn\u2019t something stupid and it takes yup Simon for him to see his stupidity. The ending was a hoot. I loved watching how Violet played him. Nicholas and Violet have had a lot of pain in their past but overall are good characters. Very likeable even when Nicholas is being cold you like him because you understand why. Simon you fall in love with immediately with his hopeful sunny disposition. It hurts to see how people treat him and watching Violet stand up for him endears her to you. The story is fast paced and entrancing. It\u2019s a story of lost lost and rekindled. Second chances at love. Friendship and loyalty. A wonderful romance that warms the heart.

I have read all the others and enjoyed this series from the first book on. I got this ARC from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. First of all it is not important to have read the previous six novels but it gives kind of an insight into the circle of Dukes we are playing with.This novel kind of starts with a house party the Duke of Ruin wants to attend because even though his nick name is not really positive he wants and needs to find a wive because he is in need of an heir sooner or later. The Duke of Ice, Nicholas Bateman, on the other side is famous because the rumour say, he murdered his wife. But he did not only lose his wife but also his child. He does not care about the ton or society, what everybody else thinks of him, nevertheless he is the Duke of Ice \u2013 as cold as Ice. Because of his friend he attends this house party and when he enters, he sees a familiar face \u2013 Lady Violet Pendleton. Violet is a young widow and the best friend of the hostess. She did not know that HE is the Duke of Ice, that he is a duke at all. In their youth they knew each other and fell in love while she stayed with relatives in Bath. They wanted to run away together \u2013 a happily ever after. But as soon as her father knew she was married of to Pendleton, whom she could not give an heir. Not even a child. She was pregnant several times but no babe survived. To see each other again is not easy for either of them because of what happened years ago. Violet had informed Nicholas but he never got the letter, for him she simply vanished though they had those big plans. He is angry with her because later on he lost his brother in the war, inherited a title he never wanted, lost his wife and child \u2013 what more could happen? And all because she married a man with a title back then. She does not know about what he has been through because she does not listen to rumours at all. Nevertheless there is this tension between them. Anger, hope, want. But he is the Duke of Ice and if he gets married again, it should be an unemotional relationship. Nobody he could lose his heart to again. The question is if Violet will be able to melt the ice heart of Nicholas or not. Darcy did a great job \u2013 AGAIN! Those characters are so well developed, the dialogues witty and you can feel Nicholas\u2018 pain.

His only friend, Simon Duke of Romsey, known as the Duke of Ruin, persuades Nick to accompany him to a house party thrown by the Linfords. Simon has been ostracised from society because of his wife's mysterious death and hopes that this party might help him to find a new bride, but the invite clearly expects him to bring the Duke of Kilve. With bad grace Nick agrees to accompany Simon only to find that the hostess' best friend is none other that Violet Caulfield, Lady Pendleton, the woman with whom he had a brief but passionate fling when they were much younger, the woman he fully intended to marry until she threw him over for a man with a title.I thought this book could have been over a lot earlier than it was. Nick spent most of the book metaphorically wringing his hands and bemoaning the fact that he was cursed because everyone he had ever loved, except Violet, was dead. To love is to feel and then when they die it is devastating so wall off your emotions and don't have any friends! Good plan. I was bored of him and his rinse and repeat 'get close to Violet then push her away' behaviour.

You have to not only build a believable romance, but you have to do it in such a way that the reader remains interested in the story and the characters, while not being bogged down by the historical portion or left bored due to the lack of sexual encounters...yes, they happen, but it is more often a slow burn for the historical romance trope.Nicholas and Violet had a past, and a relationship that was broken up by things out of their control. So, seeing one another again after years was both painful and enjoyable in the way that seeing those people you thought were totally gone from your life can be...joyous and heart-wrenching.I loved the emotion of the book, the push and pull with Nick and Violet, the idea that both of them had reasons not to think that they should be together, but that they wanted to be with one another and figuring out how to make that work.I loved the house party and the Bath setting, as so often books in England are set in London, so this was a refreshing change.At the end, events that seem maybe a little far-fetched are what leads them to admitting that they want to be together and I was hoping for more of a character driven rather than plot driven reconciliation, but it worked for me overall.I enjoyed this title.***This and other reviews featured on our blog Booked All Night http://bookedallnightblog.com/ ***"}, {"userName": "Carol Bisig", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30545825-carol-bisig", "userReview": "Nicholas Bateman has lost everyone he has loved, prematurely, he has wrapped himself into a nothing world, that way, he can't feel, cannot be hurt, cannot love.

I expect charming characters, steamy connections, and plenty of great secondary characters that make me want more. While Duke of Ice started in the same vein, I can\u2019t say that this one worked for me on many levels.Nicholas Bateman is called the Duke of Ice, and he\u2019s perfectly content shunning society and its ways. The exception is when one of his friends, The Duke of Ruin, decides to attend a house party and repair his reputation. Nick goes along for support, but he doesn\u2019t expect to reconnect with his long-lost love or for his icy fa\u00e7ade to fall spectacularly to pieces.I enjoy my grumpy, tortured heroes. I love getting into the nitty-gritty and watching the hero grow and shine. I enjoy the push-pull that leaves me anticipating each scene. Unfortunately, I never believed in the second chance love between him and Violet. I never believed in a first love between him and Violet.So, my biggest complaint was that whenever Nick and Violet were in the room together or interacting, I didn\u2019t feel that connection that I was hoping for. There are very few details on their romance to begin with and compound that to the present where the desire and passion and connection wasn\u2019t there?Much of their time together focused on finding a match for Simon, the Duke of Ruin, instead of reigniting their connection. In fact, Simon stole the show completely. I was so invested in him! But when it came time for the main characters? I didn\u2019t feel it.Then the ending? Their was an abrupt wrench in the plot that didn't fit. It seemed to be an afterthought, and it had me doubting Nick really cared for Violet at all. While there are a few moments where Nick shines as a character, the overall romance between the main couple left me unsatisfied. I definitely recommend this series, but perhaps not this book if you\u2019re just starting out.

However, arguably this book in my opinion would of been a five star. I should grade it as a 2 and a half, but the writing makes it the most difficult decision to how to grade. Why? Darcy Burke is one of many talented writers that usually captures and keeps my attention. I love her storylines! Saying that., I loved this story line. I liked the plot, loved all the action and the way the story flowed. I loved her writing it was like being captured and held as a part of the story. All in all it should of been a five star keeper! The heroine as well as the secondary characters are well written and keep you reading. So why the problem to grade the book? THE hero, was in my opinion a natural disaster. I would of dropped him and left. What a snark. I hung on all through the book hoping to start to like him, however by the end I could only tolerate him. I have to admit it is important to me that the hero as well as the heroine are likable in some fashion. In this one, all the characters except for the hero were great! So as much as it goes against everything I know, I am downgrading this based on my own preferences and upgrading it based on the beautiful gift of writing the story itself has!

But when he comes face-to-face with his first love -- the woman that ended up marrying a viscount instead -- Nicholas decides that his self-imposed solitude can't go on. Will he give Lady Violet Pendleton another chance, or will they lose their second chance at forever after because of Nicholas's fear of losing those he loves?I am a huge fan of Ms. Burke's contemporary romances, but this is the first of her Historical romances that I have read, and I've got to say that this story was absolutely enthralling, fast-paced and was a total page turner because of the hero and the reason for him being known as The Duke of Ice. Really, he comes off as cold and aloof in the beginning, but definitely thaws throughout this story, as he interacts with Violet and the secondary characters. The way this story started drew me in immediately, as I loved Nick's good friend Simon; a man that has been through so much, and yet, still wants to find happiness again despite the way people talk about him. However, it was from the moment the hero and heroine come face-to-face for the first time that this story became very interesting, as Violet is determined to make things right between them, but Nicholas isn't about to make things easy for her. How long will it take for the hero to warm up to the heroine?As for the dialogue, it was well-written, compelling and intense due to the main characters back stories, especially that of the hero as everything that's happened in his life has made him a man that no longer forms emotional attachments. However, in saying that, I loved the tight friendship he shares with Simon, the Duke of Romsey; and that Simon can manage to coax Nicholas out of his self-imposed solitude. Moreover, the hero has been through so much in his life and I could understand why he's The Duke of Ice because losing loved ones is hard to handle and sometimes it's easier to be alone. Yet, I liked how the hero goes from The Duke of Ice to seeing that life is worth living again and that second chances are possible, if he's willing to take the risk. Will Nicholas realize that being with Violet is better than being without?While the heroine, she's been through a lot too, and I could understand why her relationship with her parents is so strained after what they did that saw her marry a horrible man. Furthermore, Violet is resilient and courageous in the way she approaches Nicholas and handles everything he throws at her, as he does his best to remain cold and aloof to her persistence to make things right between them. I also liked how kind and caring Violet was and that she would do anything for those she counts as friends, which is proven by what she does for Nicholas's friend Simon; a man that is shunned by society because of what they believe he did to someone he loved. Overall, Ms. Burke has delivered a superb and worthwhile read in this book where the chemistry between Nicholas and Violet was off-the-charts and had me wondering when things would heat up between them; the romance was wonderful and convincing and had me hoping for the best for this couple; and the ending had me worried for one of the main characters, but had me liking how things worked out between the hero and heroine because no one deserves a chance at forever after more than Nicholas and Violet after everything they've been through. However, it was the epilogue that wrapped this story up perfectly, as miracles do happen and I liked that Nicholas has found happiness after so much loss. I would recommend The Duke of Ice by Darcy Burke, if you enjoy Historical Romance, second chance romances, or books by authors Anna Campbell, Christi Caldwell, Jess Michaels and Eva Devon."}, {"userName": "Cathy Geha", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21182032-cathy-geha", "userReview": "The Duke of Ice by Darcy BurkeThe Untouchables #7Young love thwartedSecond chance givenWill it be taken or squandered?Eight years before this book begins Nick and Violet met and fell in love. With his prospects only being a mister without a title, well, Violet\u2019s parents whisked her away to marry another \u2013 and she let them. So, when the two meet at the house party they do know one another but neither is the young, hopeful, easy person they once were. There is attraction. There is conversation and there is a kiss or two shared BUT will there be more? Nick went to war, lost many of his loved ones and feels \u201ccursed\u201d and unwilling to love again. He is not as easy to approach or as spontaneous or smiling but is his old warm self really gone forever encased in the icy exterior he presents to the world? His friend Simon, Duke of Romsey (or Ruin as some call him) has not given up on him and as a result the two are off to a house party together. Violet had an unhappy marriage to a man that did not love her and in more than one way abused her. She was happy to be rid of him though unhappy he had to die in order for her to be free. When she sees Nick the feelings of love she never surrendered are reignited and Simon encourages her to try to break through the ice surrounding the man she has continued to love. The house party has games, events, conversations; young girls on the marriage market, older women that are \u201cmean girls\u201d and the potential for all to get to know one another. The hostess is hopeful that she will be able to provide \u2018the\u2019 event that will elevate her social status. The young women and their parents hope for introductions to men that might be suitors of a suitable sort. Nick hopes that rumors about Simon can be squelched and is willing to be there for his friend\u2026just as Simon is there for Nick. After the house party there is a sense of\u2026well\u2026an unsettled sense for both Nick and Violet. Nick is beginning to thaw but has not thawed enough by the end of the party.

A lot of people cared and loved him---Violet, his uncle, his brother, his first wife and Simon (his best friend). Unlike Violet, her parents didn't not think of her happiness and well-being. But look at her, she's still positive.It was a good thing that I didn't get exhausted reading Nick's behavior and sentiments. Probably to the credit of the author's writing skills. Because truly, a guy who is a slave to his emotions is very draining, vert toxic. I want to stay away from them as far as possible.I don't believe that Diana Kingman didn't want to marry. In my point of view, she was a schemer and aimed for a duke. Her tactic was just different from the usual tonnish miss. While other debutantes set out to trap a gentleman, she used negotiation to land an aristocrat. If Nick believed that Diana was a welcome breath of serenity in the chaos of his life, then good luck to him.Lastly, in my outlook, the writer should change the personality of Violet's dearest friend, Hannah. She has the need to be recognized by the upper echelons of Society. Violet needs to be wary of her instead. Hannah might be befriending her, maybe even using her because she's a viscountess. In my experience, social climbers aren't safe friends. Acquaintance, tolerable but never welcome them in your inner circle. And you shouldn't spill your past/secret with social climbers for they are also gossip mongers; they can't be trusted. Sharing something intimate with them is like posting it on Facebook and letting your network know. It was proven because:1. Hannah threatened Violet that if Violet didn't share the juicy tidbits that happened in the afternoon, she'll look for Lady Nixon and Mrs. Law to ferret out the details.2. Hannah told a bit of Violet's ill-fated marriage to Nicholas. And she promised to Violet not to divulge anything. Apparently, social climbers don't know how to keep promises as well.Anyway, I hope Simon's love story will be better than this one because he seems like a really nice person who deserves a second chance and happy ending even if he doesn't know how. I wish that it wouldn't be like my reaction towards The Duke of Desire.

So if you\u2019re new to the Untouchables but are put off by that number, don\u2019t worry, you can jump right in.Having said that, this isn\u2019t my favourite of the series. Normally I love a second chance romance and I\u2019m quite fond of a little antagonism. The problem was that Nick, the eponymous duke, really wasn\u2019t ready to rejoin society. He has lost a lot in his life and is understandably still grieving over them, which is why he\u2019s so icy, but it also makes him quite nasty at times. Yes, there is some goodness in him, which is why he\u2019s willing to venture out of his self-imposed isolation for his best-friend, Simon\u2019s sake, but it doesn\u2019t excuse his behaviour.Violet was better. A widow who has pain of her own to deal with, yet who can still see the good in others. Even Nick, who does nothing to deserve it. Their romance never quite fit for me. They knew each other before and fell in love, so they must automatically fall in love again this time \u2013 based on nothing much. I much preferred the friendship she formed with Simon, and probably would have been happier if she had ended up with him instead.I really liked Simon, even if I was doubtful that any duke, let alone a young one, would ever be cast out of society for any reason, even one as dark as his. He\u2019s the best part of this book and I can\u2019t wait to read his own story.Sadly, I didn\u2019t really like any of the other characters, especially not Hannah the shallow hostess, and the new young debutantes were a bit interchangeable, even if they do seem to have sturdy feminist principles for a nice change. As for the way the plot veers after the house party\u2026 that really didn\u2019t work for me. I had felt a little sorry for Nick at times, but the final third swiftly sorted that out.So, in all, this is my least favourite of the series, despite having one of my favourite tropes. Neither the characters, nor the romance really worked for me, and I didn\u2019t like the way the plot unfolded.

Except Violet Caulfield, which must mean he never loved her. Nine years after she threw him over to marry a viscount, Nick is a widowed duke who prefers isolation. When a friend convinces him to leave his lair of self-imposed solitude, he considers taking another wife, provided she agrees to his terms: no emotional attachment of any kind. Now widowed, Lady Violet Pendleton hopes for a second chance with the man she\u2019s always loved. But she isn\u2019t prepared for the desolation in his soul or the animosity he still bears toward her. Despite those obstacles, it\u2019s clear their passion hasn\u2019t dimmed. However, the heat between them isn\u2019t enough to melt the Duke of Ice, and this time Violet may find herself the jilted party. Can love, once so tragically lost, finally be found? My Thoughts:I loved this well written second chances romance. This entire series has been wonderful to date.I have read them all and anxiously look forward to each one as they are published.When Violet married a Viscount instead of Nick he was sure she was simply a fortune hunter. That was not the reason she threw him over. It wasn't her choice. Her father, who didn't approve of Nick arranged for her to marry the Viscount and when he found her unchaste he treated her with cruelty.Now she is widowed and so is Nick. He prefers to be left alone to his own devices. He is now a Duke and tries to avoid all things associated with the ton.Can these two overcome the obstacles of their past and fall into a lasting love?Second chances are a very poignant style of romantic stories.I gave this book 4.75 of 5.0 stars for storyline and characterization and a sensual rating of 3.75 of 5.0 flames.

Except Violet Caulfield, which must mean he never loved her. Nine years after she threw him over to marry a viscount, Nick is a widowed duke who prefers isolation. When a friend convinces him to leave his lair of self-imposed solitude, he considers taking another wife, provided she agrees to his terms: no emotional attachment of any kind. Now widowed, Lady Violet Pendleton hopes for a second chance with the man she\u2019s always loved. But she isn\u2019t prepared for the desolation in his soul or the animosity he still bears toward her. Despite those obstacles, it\u2019s clear their passion hasn\u2019t dimmed. However, the heat between them isn\u2019t enough to melt the Duke of Ice, and this time Violet may find herself the jilted party. Can love, once so tragically lost, finally be found?", "title": "The Duke of Ice\n      \n          (The Untouchables #7)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36320497-the-duke-of-ice", "average": 4.14, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1510974682l/36320497.jpg", "reviews": 100, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5823441.Darcy_Burke", "name": "Darcy Burke"}], "type": ["Romance", "Historical", "Romance", "Historical Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36320497-the-duke-of-ice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17696073-her-wicked-ways", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30131710-the-duke-of-daring", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29417844-the-forbidden-duke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31684539-the-duke-of-deception", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34043010-the-duke-of-desire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11781578-lover-s-leap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable"]}
