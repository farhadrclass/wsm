Before I started this book I had read many mixed reviews of it. Many people were on the fence as to their opinions of it. After reading it I have to say to those reviewers,\"ARE YOU PEOPLE NUTS,DID YOU READ THE SAME BOOK I READ?\"  I loved the book and even found it incredibly frustrating at times. The story aroused many strong emotions with every turn of the page. I found myself cheering for the characters victories and filled with dismay at their defeats. Some of the characters aroused such feelings of anger and disdain they actually became my favorites. I say this because, for those unfamiliar with his writings, Mark Tufo has an incredible ability to bring his characters to life with unbelievable depth. Some readers made not so positive comments about the flashbacks throughout the book. I have to say I liked them. They explained so much about the motivations that drove the characters. They helped explain the bonds between some and the distance between others.  As for the plot of the story, all I can say is get ready for a roller coaster of the unexpected. I don't want to give anything away so that is all I will say. Just be ready for what you least expect. This one will have you cheering, cursing, and in complete and utter dismay. It is just what an apocalyptic horror story should be.  Just read the book! You will enjoy it! Hats of to you Mark Tufo you have delivered superbly, I can't wait for Zombie Fallout 6."}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "ok, have read all the other reviews and anyone who knows me will tell you I am a zombienut! plus I think Mark Tufo is fantastic!I can see the positives and negatives on all reviews.It is a fab book and a real fan pleaser as no constant refs or repeats of passed books, always fresh stuff! which is great for us constant fans.... not so good if you pick the book up from fresh, but hopefully the no.5 on the cover gives that away!!Yes it does have a lot of pre zombie flashbacks but I feel that just builds the emotion and tensions going on with the characters and delivers the intensity of the \"fall\" of MT.Cliff hanger or abrupt ending? I think more cliff hanger.... we know that Mr Tufo is working on no.6 (hopefully no.7 & 8 too).Very character focused on just a few ppl but that only intensifies the action (in my opinion) and allows you to love, and hate, deeper......I can empathise with the reviewer who was on his 5th redbull, only 4hrs til work and still page turning.... I allocated my day off and let the housework slide to read this book (having been caught out before!) I DID feed my cats tho!!as an avid cat lady myself I could relate on so many levels to that particular nightmare.... not sure about the cat stomping tho (grrr or should that be hiss!)This series is encompassing so many genres; comedy, horror, paranormal, thriller...."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4117775-megan", "userReview": "I cannot believe I have not written a review of any of the Zombie Fallout books yet. These books are just fantastic and along with the White Flag of the Dead books I have lost plenty of sleep staying up late reading these books. Warning this review is a little spoilerish. Where do we even start the writing is superb why because Mike and company are not just characters they are real people well with the exception of Eliza and Tommy/Tomas that you could meet anywhere. Yet these people are unique but realistic. However Mark, I want to shake you and ask why and then beg you to publish the sixth book immediately. I can clearly see how Tufo took inspiration from his real life and made it into a book. Sadly I think this book was the hardest one to read in the series. Why do you ask because some serious *hit goes down in this book. From the get go Mike and company know a showdown with Eliza and her \u201cflying monkeys\u201d (my terms not Marks) is inevitable, the group is also being proactive. However their plan to literally cut Eliza off at the pass goes awry and the group all suffers as a consequence. There is also a sub-plot with the Sea Hag (Mrs. Devarux) which really left me with an uneasy feeling. The bulk of the book consists of Mike and company struggling to find each other after being split up and get the heck out of Dodge, but the zombies and a few humans will be having none of that. Sadly a character or two does not make it thanks to certain person\u2019s murderous and deceitful actions. That is why this book is so hard to read because someone is manipulating the group to serve their own selfish needs. We also get a little bit more info on this person. Considering their actions I think this info may be more important later on and we have not seen the last of this person. As I stated a good portion of the book is the group trying to find one another. However Mike\u2019s powers are starting to evolve and I think in some ways this further complicates an already precarious and tense situation. The last \u00bc of the book is tragic because you become invested in a characters storyline, to find it does not end well. The actions that led to the resolution of said storyline also lead up to the most baffling cliffhanger ending. We also learn a little more about Mike and Paul BZ (before zombies) which was great but it also made what happens in the book just little harder to swallow. All I can say is I hope we get another book and soon. The last quarter of the book was just wickedly twisted and it would be cruel to leave the fans hanging for too long. This book as always is another excellent installment in the series. Read it."}, {"userName": "Todd Menesses", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39659881-todd-menesses", "userReview": "Not the best in the series so far but still worthy of picking up and continuing. Too many flashbacks in this one for me. That seemed to make it feel a little disjointed. Narration as always was spot on by Sean."}, {"userName": "Nathan Tullis", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18356135-nathan-tullis", "userReview": "*I received a free copy of this audio book for review from Audiobookreview.com*Having listened to the previous Zombie Fallout books, I\u2019ve grown to really enjoy this series. There is dark humor, witty dialogue, zombie action, mind controlling vampires, and a fair share of heart. This was pretty much the same.Zombie Fallout 5 opens with Talbot & Co. looking for revenge. They plan to attack a caravan towing Eliza, Tommy, and a lot of zombies in hopes of crippling them enough to keep her off their backs. 3 survivors soon find themselves being taken in by a mother and her child, while another batch of the Talbot clan has difficulties of their own. It\u2019s a race against time, and zombies, as Mike tries to find a lost friend and uncover a secret hanging over his head. Can Mike Talbot trust everyone in his group? Can he hold on to his sliver of sanity when he see the truth? I couldn\u2019t tell you, the book ends with a brutal cliffhanger that is infuriating. Not only because the story doesn\u2019t end, also because I want the rest of the story. Luckily, I already have the next installment available to me, otherwise it would have moved down on my list. I don\u2019t typically mind cliffhangers in series, when they\u2019re done well and the book tells a complete story. That\u2019s not the case here. It\u2019s just completely open ended, intriguing and exciting, but annoyingly unfinished.Sean Runnette yet again takes the role of Mike Talbot. I haven\u2019t listened to anything else Runnette has done, but his voice fits in perfectly with Tufo\u2019s writing. There was no background noise, static, or mumbling. He\u2019s a solid narrator and I couldn\u2019t think of anyone else who could play these characters.Mostly, I really enjoyed this story. There were a couple of long flashback scenes that kind of took you out of the story, but they were entertaining. If you like a zombie drama, you will probably like this book."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5241263-holly", "userReview": "**SPOILER**First the bad. I really wanted to love this story. I really, really, really wanted to. But I couldn't. Not only was it shorter than the others, but it was severely lacking in action. It felt like a filler, or maybe just the first half of a good story. Kind of like Mr. Tufo just wanted to get something published while he's hot. Another problem I had was when he gave a shout out to himself, by mentioning Indian Hill (on a night stand, in an abandoned house). It bothers me. I'm not sure why, but it does. I'm also super creeped out by Paul's death... CATS!? Icky. As for Mike- I don't believe Mr. Tufo would just kill him off... the story is still unfinished. The editing is a bit rough, and I still don't like the \"journal\" aspect. Finally, I wish Mr. Tufo would have written The Blood Stone stories as one book, instead of in pieces attached to the others. Now the Good. I really liked how Deneaux is turning out. She went from a crotchety old bat... to a calculating, murdering, old bat. It's awesome. As always, Mike's sarcasm and speak-before-he-thinks outbursts lighten up a dark story. He reminds me of Home (Massachusetts). I also like how he's starting to explore his \"talents\". I like Tomas/ Tommy, and how we're still not sure what he's going to do in the end. The reason I did give this book a 3 is the people. I love them, even the secondary ones."}, {"userName": "Sakinah Jonas-mawji", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14127419-sakinah-jonas-mawji", "userReview": "The Zombie Fallout series of books is right up there in my top favorite zombie horror fiction novels. I'm a totally devoted zombie horror reader, video-gamer and movie buff, and this particular series was impossible to put down. I hope there will be another book soon! It's hard to find a balance between humor, suspense, action and horror without crossing a line into unnecessary graphic morbidity that would have definitely put me off reading them, and I have read other books by authors that couldn't get the balance right. Mark Tufo has managed to maintain this unique balance with all of his Zombie Fallout books to perfection. Mr Tufo has developed his characters so well in this series that the reader feels completely drawn in, feeling specific emotions for specific characters, and willing them to survive! Or in some cases meet their just demise! It feels like a genuine loss when one of the good guys dies! Keep them coming Mark.

My favourite thing about Mark Tufos books is he isn't afraid of his characters. In that sense i mean that, a lot of writers fall so much for their characters lead or non lead that they are afraid to harm them or kill them off.

This one didn\u2019t get have the panache of the previous books in the series. Still good though. A few things that made it less wonderful:I miss Tommy!There were a lot of stories from earlier days in people\u2019s lives. It does flesh them out as characters, but so often the stories were added in the midst of turmoil and I just wanted to know what happened next. Tufo does do a pretty darn good job of bringing those short stories to life though. Paul\u2019s best friend status with Mike never sat well with me. It never really seemed like Mike cared for him that much. In the last book when Mike was looking for the Alex/Paul group Mike mostly talked about his need to get to Alex to help him out of a jam. Paul also never came close to being as competent as Mike which seemed odd in the sense that I couldn\u2019t understand why Mike would choose a friend who wasn\u2019t very capable. I do plan to read the Indian Hill series which I believe has both Paul and Mike in it exploring their earlier years and I\u2019m curious to see if the author makes Paul a little stronger (not just physically) in those. Also, BT seemed like a much closer friend to Mike than Paul was even though Paul and Mike were friends for 30+ years and BT and Mike only new each other for some months. ...I didn\u2019t care for Paul at all anyways. Even though this book wasn\u2019t as great as the other ones, it seems like the stories were needed to advance the overall plot. I.e. It might be difficult in future books for Mike to have 2 best friends; it adds to the plot to have a \u201cvillain\u201d within the group; and having Mike be lost to the group is going to make for some intense moments in the next book. On the plus side, Tracy wasn\u2019t in most of the book and when she was, she wasn\u2019t quite as witchy."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3960198-danielle", "userReview": "...Cats man.

But... Zombie Fallout 5: Alive in a Dead World felt like a whole lot of stalling by Mark Tufo. There was some headway made in the general progress of the story of course but the headway that was made was very small where the general plot is concerned. I've said it before and I'll say it again one of the main reasons that the book series is as enjoyable as it is is of the little quirks that Mike Talbot have and the myriad of interesting characters in the book. Mike's quips with... well anyone and his incredibly short attention span makes it a trip when reading from his portions. Mike's best friend in the book seems downright hopeless to me... Mrs. Deno... She's an... interesting one... I can also add a couple others who I all find fascinating and who brings something to the book. I must say though that where this book is concerned the author drags his foot along a lot. A big portion of the book's plot are a series of seemingly useless flashbacks (I kid you not, they seem completely and utterly useless to me except for providing some fodder to maybe laugh at). There was also a huge emphasis on Mike growing into his new powers. In the grand scheme of things though, I would say that probably one or two really note worthy things happen in this book (both of which I found just plain gruesome even for a Zombie book... I mean.... I am shocked and not in a good way...). Both occurrences could have been fit in the other book prior to this. And to add insult to injury.... this book more than any other ends in a MASSIVE cliff hanger. I really don't understand how or why Mark Tufo would do that...
