Twelve short stories (each involving either Zombies or Unicorns) provide ample evidence for both sides, it is up to you to decide which one is truly better.The highest justice by Garth Nix - Right off the bat we are toeing the line. An undead queen carried by a unicorn of death has one last wish - a kiss from her husband. Macabre and fun.Love will tear us apart by Alaya Dawn Johnson - WOW. Just literally wow. This one is by far my fave of the set. Stay with me here - a gay zombie falls in love with the zombie hunter's son. I know. I know. I'm getting chills. It was so well written (and from second person to boot) and the characters are flawless. Alaya \nneeds\n to turn this one into a whole storyPurity test by Naomi Novik - Our homeless heroine is recruited by a unicorn for some very dastardly deeds. Very entertaining and for once, the virgin thing isn't so cut-and-dry.Bougainvillea by Carrie Ryan - Iza and her family control one of last zombie free islands on earth. When a mysterious boy visits, Iza begins to wonder at what price her safety costs. A thousand flowers by Margo Lanagan - We start with one very drink man looking for somewhere to pee. In his stupor, he managed to follow a unicorn and discover a passed out girl in a state of great distress. Nine months later something very peculiar happens. The children of the revolution by Maureen Johnson - whewww, a mother's love knows no bounds...but even so, you'd think she'd draw the line at zombifying children? Creepy and disturbing! The care and feeding of your baby killer unicorn  by Diana Peterfreund - Unicorns are back, they are hungry and meat is on the menu. Wen, a young girl, finds a baby killer unicorn and she doesn't have the heart to kill him. Inoculata by Scott Westerfeld - One of the last human settlements is constantly surrounded by zombies. The teens in this one felt a little stereotypical-YA-winers but it wasn't too bad. The ending didn't make sense to me - too many plot holes. Princess prettypants by Meg Cabot - What do you (a no-nonsense 17 yr old feminist) do when an aunt (rich, but distant) gives you a unicorn named Princess Prettypants? Obviously go on the most badass adventure possible! Cold hands by Cassandra Clare - A town with a steady population of the undead. A murder covered up by a family. One, stunning conclusion. The third virgin by Kathleen Duey - A unicorn with a death wish and serious substance abuse problems. Never thought I'd read about a junkie unicorn!Prom night  by Libba Bray - Hosting prom is stressful. Hosting prom using generators, scavenged decorations and stale snacks because the stupid zombie apocalypse happened is even worse.  Audiobook Comments There were 3 readers for this one, which helped with high variety in tone / character in the short stories. The introductions to each story sounded wooden, but then again, they were a bit awkward to read too."}, {"userName": "Catie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1886642-catie", "userReview": "[bestiality.

Better a peaceful sleep in the earth than the life of a zombie\u2013not really dead but not really alive, either.\u201d- Zombies Vs. Unicorns, Cassandra Clare.\n\nMy thoughts: Introduction\nLet us start off with the introduction in each of the story that was presented in the book. Every introduction began with a heated conversation between Holly (Team Unicorn) and Justine (Team Zombie). Their conversations were mostly about how you should switch your team to Team Zombie instead of Team Unicorn or how disgusting zombies really are. While I was reading the book, I looked forward on reading the introduction of each story because I enjoyed them and it made me laughed. I am sure you will laugh as well if you read the book!The plot of each story was unique and it proved how much time and effort the authors clicked the plot of their stories together! Some of the short stories in the book make me wish for a whole physical book dedicated to the stories I really want to read more about because some of them ended with a cliff-hanger and Oh my goodness, that\u2019s not cool! I need more of them!The pacing for this book was not at all fast. It was slow in some stories and fast in the others. It took me 7 days to finish the book and this book was definitely worth the time! (Even though I kind of failed my June To-Be-Read Piles\u2026)Some of the stories in the book dragged and let me tell you this: I did not enjoy the part where it dragged. We, as readers, tend to get bored when a story drags. So.. Yes, I did get bored and yawned a little at some point but I forced myself through those parts and the result is: I loved this book!But I did not enjoy all the stories in the book. Some stories that were written by Libba Bray, Garth Nix, Scott Westerfeld and Margo Lanagan felt flat to me. The characters did not really appeal to me in any way and there were quite a lot of unexplained things that bothered me throughout their stories. Bu-, but, I loved their writing style which I will talk more about later on, and I will, no doubt, be reading the work they published! Now, let us get on with the writing style!\nWriting:\nFor the writing style section, I will be doing it according to whose story was presented first, second, etc. For example, Garath Nix\u2019s story was the first story that was presented in the book, so, I am going to talk about his writing style first.Team Unicorn: Garath Nix\u2019s (Story Name: The Highest Justice) writing style for this book was great! It was simplistic, lyrical and articulate. Even though his story felt flat for me, I still want to read more from him and I can\u2019t wait to read his other work beside Zombies Vs. Unicorns!Team Zombie: Alaya Dawn Johnson\u2019s (Story Name: Love will tear us apart) writing style for this book was simply beautiful! I found her story to be intriguing because she writes like none other authors. She wrote \u2018Love will tear us apart\u2019 in second person point of view: you. It was weird and pretty uncomfortable in the beginning, but after a while, my love for the story and her writing style started growing and I ended up really enjoying the POV.Team Unicorn: Naomi Novik\u2019s (Story name: Purity Test) writing style for this book was fabulous! I don\u2019t think I can form a proper sentence\u2026 word, I mean, for her writing style.. So, I will just have to say that her writing style was fabulous.Team Zombie: Carrie Ryan\u2019s (Story Name: Bougainvillea) writing style was awesome! I am going to read her other work soon. Her story and her writing style pulled me in until her story ended. (And I still cannot believe it ended that way.. [Spoiler])Team Unicorn: Margo Lanagan\u2019s (Story Name: A Thousand Flowers) writing style was rare, I would say. Rare in saying how she changes point of views so quickly and professionally! Her story felt flat for me but her writing style totally did not!Team Zombie: Maureen Johnson\u2019s (Story name: The Children Of Revolution) writing style and plot were oddly beautiful and touching. Firstly, Her writing style was as clear as the crystal\u2026 If you get what I am trying to say. Secondly, the plot of the story killed my heart and touched my heart with healing powers at the same time. I just can\u2019t\u2026 That ending definitely destroyed me. (Sorry, I can\u2019t tell you guys! I would be spoiling you if I have told you about the ending!)Team Unicorn: Diana Peterfreund\u2019s (Story name: The care and feeding of your killer baby unicorn) writing style was very lyrical! Her writing style makes me want to read her other work, such as, \u2018For Darkness Shows the Stars\u2019 now! Her writing style was truly a work of art!Team Zombie: Scott Westerfeld\u2019s (Story Name: Inoculata) writing style was not my favorite in this book. His writing style was a little inarticulate and a little too flowery but I am still looking forward on reading his other work even though I didn\u2019t really like his writing style and the story!Team Unicorn: Meg Cabot\u2019s (Story Name: Princess PrettyPants) writing style was fantastic! I did not really like her writing style in the beginning because I found it to be indirect, but I have grown to love her writing as the story progressed further. Team Zombie: Cassandra Clare\u2019s (Story name: Cold Hands) writing style was great.. As always! Her story was bittersweet and I loved it! I will be reading \u2018The Mortal Instrument\u2019 Series soon! Team Unicorn: Kathleen Duey\u2019s (Story name: The Third Virgin) writing style was clean and articulate. Basically, the plot of her story was about a unicorn becoming suicidal. Kind of weird because I have never thought of unicorns turning suicidal. Now, the story sticks in my head ever since I finished the book.Team Zombie: Libba Bray\u2019s (Story name: Prom Night) writing style was consistence and fabulous! I loved her writing style, but unfortunately, the story she wrote felt flat for me.. But, I am still looking forward on reading \u2018The Diviners\u2019 book trilogy by her! \nCharacters:\nFor the characters section, I am just going to talk about a few characters in the book that I loved! So, let us get on with it!Jess (From The Highest Justice): She was a character that was brave, badass and kind. She is, no doubt, in my favorite characters list and I wish we can have a physical book fully dedicated to her and her trials in the throne. Grayson (From Love will tear us apart): She is definitely the best character in the book! She had a great character growth in a short story. She was not kind and not a good person. That\u2019s all I am going to talk about her because I do not want to spoil the surprise for you guys!Iza (From Bougainvillea): She had\u2026 a great character growth but the character growth came crashing down at the end of the story. To be honest, I kind of died off a little because she had potential but she turned into what her [Spoiler] was. But, all in all, I still loved her.Wen (From The Care and Feeding of your Baby Killer Unicorn): She was pretty weak in the beginning, but her character growth increased as the story proceeded. Wen was kind, a little annoying, brave and adventurous! I loved her character in this book!\nOverall:\nI am giving this book an 80% rating. I loved it and I recommend you all to check this book out! \n\u201cShe feels like someone has planted a tree in her chest and then pressed fast foward on the world, branches growing and twisting and pushing her apart from the inside.\u201d- Zombies Vs. Unicorns, Carrie Ryan.\nThis review is also posted at Maxxesbooktopia: Zombies Vs.

The stories themselves weren't that bad, although some of them were pretty... out there. Not many of them made sense or kept to the overall theme of the actual collection. And I don't mean that I expected the stories to be about zombies and unicorns having it out, but I expected the stories to at least center around zombies and/or unicorns. But the majority of the stories only mentioned unicorns or zombies briefly. The zombie stories were the worst offenders, as many of them were just about people living in camps or compounds and the undead were only mentioned at the beginning or end of the stories. The editors' remarks were really what made the collection horrible, though. Holly Black manages to write paragraphs while managing to say nothing at all, and Justine Larbalestier was an absolute harpy. Just insult after insult (all in \"good fun\", I'm sure) to \"Team Unicorn\" and being an outright brat made me put down the book and shake my head numerous times. Overall, the stories are lackluster, the editors incompetent, and the appeal severely lacking."}, {"userName": "Kat Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy", "userReview": "Zombies...

You're one of my favourite authors! This story was kind of awesome in that I felt like this should have been the beginning to one of your amazing big adventure series.

No really, I am. And I grew up on The Last Unicorn, bad singing and all. So when I heard of the concept of this book, what makes better fiction, zombies or unicorns? I had to smile. What a fun idea for a short story anthology.I cracked the cover thinking \"zombies for the win, all the way.\" I never laugh when I read, crack a smile at most, but not laugh. The introduction alone, a debate between editors Holly Black and Justine Larbalestier about the benefits of zombies and unicorns, had me laughing out loud. Oh the stories that could fill this anthology. So who won my heart? Team zombies or team unicorns? Here's the fickle trail of my loyalty:1. The Highest Justice by Garth Nix. The most interesting thing about this story was the titillation of a zombie appearance. It was okay, had the flair of a medieval unicorn story but without any of the mystique of the medieval creatures. I think Nix should have stuck to team zombie and left the description of unicorns to someone who wanted to write about them.2. Love Will Tear Us Apart by Alaya Dawn Johnson. The story started out crass with way too many f words. I'm not a fan of crass humor (or the f word), not even a little. The zombie POV with descriptions of his virus as a psychopathic disorder were awesome and the battle of love vs zombie feeding was good too (Twilight-esque without the cheese), but all that crassness made me feel dirty and I never recovered from it. Plus, I'm not a fan of same-sex romances. I know zombies are gross, but they can be funny or scary without the crass factor, right? Maybe I don't want to be on team zombie.3. Purity Test by Naomi Novik. Score one for humor. Jokes about finding a virgin in NYC, Harry Potter, and how dragons are so much cooler than unicorns, which begs the question: dragons or vampires? Sequel, anyone? Midway through it fizzled and got old, but a team unicorner who has a sense of humor about unicorns, maybe I'm switching teams.4. Bougainvillea by Carrie Ryan. We already know Ryan can write a best seller about the zombie apocalypse. Couldn't she surprise us with a good unicorn story? Or even a different zombie story? Okay the story was interesting and memorable (beside the tense shifts that drove me crazy), but zombie apocalypse, dictatorship keeping the last remaining humans intact, rebellious teenager, haven't we read this before, from her?5. A Thousand Flowers by Margo Lanagan. The POV shifted in the middle of the story, dropping the only character I connected with. Several vague explanations and descriptions later (not a fan of the writing), we learn that the point of unicorns is not to save the wrongly accused, to heal the princess child, to avenge the robbery of her purity, but beastiality, and a romance that leaves a lot of victims in its wake (including its readers with those graphic images in our head, not only beastiality, but with a child, nice). What ever happened to the magical creatures that were supposed to be the point of this anthology? Are they ever going to make an appearance? Definitely team zombie at this point.6. The Children of the Revolution by Maureen Johnson. A satire about celebrity-adopted children \"cured\" from death by a zombie virus. Tom Cruise on his no medication media rant, Angelina Jolie adopting yet another child, celebrities who don't actually raise their children, I'll let you decide what Johnson is mocking. Either way, the satire made me smile. I knew there was a reason I was team zombie.7. The Care and Feeding of Your Baby Killer Unicorn by Diana Peterfreund. If I can't get a magical unicorn the way they are depicted in medieval fiction, I'll take a killer, wild-animal version with the vampire unicorn slayer who just can't kill them. Another story that tied into the mythology and storyline of her novel, even more so, but since I haven't read it, I didn't have the same expectation for new creativity I did with Ryan. A strong story and protagonist. I'm not discounting team unicorn just yet.8. Inoculata by Scott Westerfeld. I was into this story until it just ended, a flat, empty, quitting of words because it'd already gone on too long. Westerfeld tried to make a quick, enlightening statement, or maybe just make me think about zombies a different way, but it didn't work for me. (There's some girl-on-girl action, same girl later going for some girl-on-boy action. It is in vogue these days.) The story was just developing when it ended, leaving me to wonder if maybe there just weren't any more good zombie stories out there. My loyalty is in limbo.9. Princess Prettypants by Meg Cabot. Again with the sense of humor about unicorns. None of team zombie have touched humor (except Johnson with her satire that's not nearly as strong as this story). Cabot says, yeah okay, so unicorns are the obnoxious fairytales of little girls, but if one showed up on your doorstep, would you actually turn it away (or sell it on ebay) or would use that fierce, magical power to intimidate your ex-boyfriend? Oh yeah, and happy endings aren't so bad either. Mock all you want, you know deep down, you'd love a unicorn. Score one for team unicorn.10. Cold Hands by Cassandra Clare. Not having read the Mortal Instruments series myself, I had heard that Clare's writing was atrocious, but I found her writing in this quite beautiful. Her zombies aren't the brain-sucking types, just undead cursed to return from the grave seeking out the company of their loved ones, making the love story not quite the moral dilemma of Johnson's story, but I still liked it. It's a sweet zombie love story. I'm still open to either team.11. The Third Virgin by Kathleen Duey. I liked the idea of this psychopathic zombie unicorn story more than I liked the all-tell, no-show delivery of it. I find myself wondering if any of the team unicorn writers actually like unicorns.12. Prom Night by Libba Bray. A story about zombies on prom night? I am so there. Only, that's not what this story was about. Another zombie apocalypse, this one where the adults got infected and only children survived, and as their food and hope runs out, they hold prom. Not a bad story (although Bray once again pushes the \"I know what teens are like\" display too far), but it wasn't quite the story I'd wanted to read when I know Bray is capable of humor and zombies on prom night lend themselves to it.There was no zombie/unicorn showdown. None of the unicorns I'd expected showed up and there wasn't enough humor in the zombie stories. Each team had a story that left a bad taste in my mouth, but there were plenty that shined, which is rather difficult with a short-story anthology. So who won? Team zombie or team unicorn. I'd have to say the editors. Their commentary was hands down the best part of the book."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/726203-ellen", "userReview": "I'm not a big anthology reader, because there are usually as many stories I don't like as ones I do, and it's easy to put them down between stories.

Chances are, if you're a YA SFF reader, there are at least a few authors in here you love; there was only one name I didn't recognize.Special mentions to Naomi Novik's awesome New York-set unicorn story; Diana Peterfreund's contribution set in the Rampant universe; and Maureen Johnson's creepy zombie baby-sitting story, which I was reading on the subway when someone sat down next to me and I jumped about two feet in the air.

Therefore, I don't take especial pride in noting that the majority of these do not appeal, but only take comfort in the fact that I did my best to give each story its due, critiquing on the basis not of fanciful topic, but level of writing, however demographically-teen. The hilarious thing is, Holly Black, the author who haunted my teen/young adult/not so young adult years, doesn't even feature in this other than as an editor and erstwhile prefacer, and I refuse to count her over the top bantering as a quality reread of Valiant or Tithe. Slightly frustrating, but she isn't the only name I recognized out of past familiarity or glancing always-passed-the-books-on-the-shelves-by reference, so it was a nostalgic, if varied in reward, sojourn through the fantasy of my youth.Despite the fact that the subject material is such a hit or miss (although I wonder what the authors would make of the zombie resurgence still swamping entertainment in various cinematic forms), there is a surprising amount of middle ground. No 5's, but this has as much to do with my inherent dislike of the short story format and its tendency to tie together loose ends too neatly as it does to evaluation of various technical flaws. The 4's go to 'Bougainvillea' by Carrie Ryan, wonderfully written as well as skillfully balancing the fine line between novel world building and the short and sweet of a short story, and 'A Thousand Flowers' by Margo Langan, so well crafted and tantalizing in its diving deep into the land of sexual taboo (and I'm not talking any variation of the same-species canoodling here) that I have to wonder how anyone who's read this passes this off as entirely for teenagers. The same holds for 3 star 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' by Alaya Dohn Johnson (also an example of the appreciably substantial amount of queerness) and 2.5 star 'Cold Hands' by Cassandra Clare, both of which touch upon, you guessed it: necrophilia. One could technically make a similar argument for 2 star 'The Children of the Revolution' by Maureen Johnson, but does it count if they're both dead? Anyway, to return to the threes, Garth Nix is one of my absolute favorites (I think only a story by Philip Pullman, or Holly Black herself of course, would have appealed more), but his 'The Highest Justice' was too straightforward to merit anything higher than a 3. 'Purity Test' by Naomi Novik, 'Inoculata' by Scott Westerfield (bonus star for the queerness), and 'Prom Night' by Libba Bray (bonus star for Zoroastrianism and actual Iranian people participating in it) all garnered 2s for not doing anything out of the ordinary while reasonably entertaining, while 'The Care and Feeding of Your Baby Killer Unicorn' by Diana Peterfreund, 'Princess Prettypants' by Meg Cabot, and 'The Third Virgin' by Kathleen Duey got 1 stars for including such things as Christocentricity, normalization of rape culture, and ableism without even providing a decent story to make up for it. I suppose 'The Third Virgin' can get a half a star more, but the whole wander-thousands-of-years-in-a-supposed-frontier-aka-US-till-only-succeed-when-white-people-get-there is a bit much.I wish I had read this back in 2010, or at least whenever I first acquired it, as I've grown too used to the calcification of \"proper\" literature to push for as much queerness as I encountered amongst these supposed immaturities. It would've probably done me some good, and I would've gotten more out of watching the rise of 'The Walking Dead' and the White Walkers and 'The Last of Us' and 'World War Z' and every other zombie iteration of a possibly leveling off yet still innovatively engaging fad. As it stands, I'm hellbent on getting a proper Holly Black at my next sale, as that is one I experienced at the right time that I'm highly curious about reexperiencing and reevaluating.

Most of the unicorn stories are somewhat tongue in cheek, and with a collection of authors like these, I really never should have doubted the quality of stories for either team.On Team Zombie, my favorite stories were Scott Westerfeld's, set in an abandoned pot farm where the adults are losing it while the kids think the zombies are essentially no big deal, and Maureen Johnson's, where a celebrity adherent to a weird religion has turned her adopted kids into zombies as part of a religious rite. Carrie Ryan's story, set in the same world as The Forest of Hands and Teeth and The Dead Tossed Waves was a great addition to that world, too. For Team Unicorn, I really liked Naomi Novik's unicorn who isn't too careful about finding virgins in Central Park, and Meg Cabot's avenging unicorn. Diana Peterfreund's story is set in her already existing killer unicorns universe, and has almost convinced me that I need to hunt down those other books. The story works well on its own, but I was constantly wondering if these characters had a bigger life in the other novels or if, like in Carrie Ryan's story, these were all-new characters set in a familiar world.Justine Larbalestier and Holly Black introduce each story with a good deal of bickering. Justine is much more hostile towards unicorns than Holly is towards zombies. Holly is just creeped out by zombies, while Justine sees unicorns as offensive.

In this anthology, edited by Holly Black and Justine Larbalestier (...more It's a question as old as time itself: which is better, the zombie or the unicorn? In this anthology, edited by Holly Black and Justine Larbalestier (unicorn and zombie, respectively), strong arguments are made for both sides in the form of short stories. Half of the stories portray the strengths--for good and evil--of unicorns and half show the good (and really, really bad-ass) side of zombies. Contributors include many bestselling teen authors, including Cassandra Clare, Libba Bray, Maureen Johnson, Meg Cabot, Scott Westerfeld, and Margo Lanagan. This anthology will have everyone asking: Team Zombie or Team Unicorn? Cover BlurbI Loved this Anthology! First, lets get this out of the way, I'm 100% TEAM ZOMBIE! Since there are twelve stories in this anthology:six zombie/six unicorn, I've decided to review them in a head to head smackdown! Let's see who is triumphant! ROUND ONE The Highest Justice vs Love Will Tear Us ApartGarth Nix's story: The Highest Justice: interesting tale.It also has a necromanced zombie! Princess Jess is bringing her recently reanimated mother to confront her father the King. She has invoked the help of the Unicorn Elibet, a silent tool of vengeance that has been attached to her family for generations.The purpose of their journey is to confront the King and his sorcerous mistress who Jess suspects is responsible for her mother's death. The story is well written and dispels the gentle unicorn myth.Alaya Dawn Johnson gives us : Love Will Tear Us Apart. A very sweet and funny tale of Phillip Grayson a teen zombie. Phillip begins to hang out with the uber popular jock,Jack. Phillip's feelings for Jack straddle the line between intense hunger and an even intenser physical attraction. Jack seems to reciprocate these feelings but both of them are hiding deep secrets that threaten their slowly growing love.I loved the dark humor and teen angst in Alaya's story. It was also unique to see a Gay protagonist. I really felt attached to the characters and was rooting for them to get together. WINNER? TEAM ZOMBIE !! ROUND TWO! Purity Test vs BougainvilleaI'm a huge fan of Naomi Novik's Temeraire books so I was excited to see her take on Unicorns. Young Allison has been rudely awakened from her nap on a Central Park bench, by a Unicorn horn poke! She is confused and hungover as she takes in the irritable talking Unicorn Belcazar. Belcazar is on a mission to rescue some baby unicorns and has demanded Allison be his companion, despite her lack of virginity :) I loved this story! so much fun. Allison and Belecazar have great chemistry between them, even though it's sarcastic and argumentative.Carrie Ryan's Bougainvillea is a story set in the same world as the book The Forest Of Hands And Teeth. Iza is the daughter of a powerful Govenor on the island of Curacao. She feels trapped in her life despite its many comforts. One rash decision up ends her life and forces her to make decisions about her future. I enjoyed learning a little bit more about the world after the Return. Iza is an interesting character and i'd like to see more of her in a future story. The zombie action is a little brief but intense! WINNER? TEAM UNICORN !! ROUND THREE A Thousand Flowers vs The Children of the RevolutionI struggled with Margo Lanagan's story : A Thousand Flowers. Set in ancient times, it starts out interesting enough. A young man comes across a unicorn. Entranced he follows the Unicorn and comes across a beautuful young princess lyng on the ground. She has obviously attacked. Trying to help her the young man, Manny is captured by the King's guard. When the Princess declares him innocent he is released, until several month later when he is hunted down. It has become discovered the Princess is pregneant.At this point the story fell apart for me. It becomes obvious who the source of the child is . The narrative also shifts abruptly and the ending is anti clamatic.Children of the Revolution: Maureen Johnson. What was supposed to be a romantic farm vacation in England turns into a nightmare for college student Sofie. Abandoned by her boyfriend Franklin, Sofie takes a Babysitting job with a reclusive celebrity that will fund her way home. These aren't ordinary children though, and one simple act of compassion changes Sofie's life. This was an enjoyable story, not action packed but a definite twist ending. WINNER? TEAM ZOMBIE!! ROUND FOURThe Care and Feeding of Your Baby Killer Unicorn vs InoulataDina Peterfreund's story is set in the same universe of her Novel Rampant. Unicorns have returned to the world,and they aren't happy! They are vicious man eaters.The main character Wen has experience with them. In fact she is irrestible to them, she witnessed them attack and kill her cousins . Now barely a year later she is at a carnival freak show with some friends. The carnival advertises a live unicorn called Venom. Wen's friends think it's fake but once Wen is in the tent she instantly knows it isn't. Wen can feel the unicorns emotions, read it's thoughts and has fantastic powers when she is in a unicorn's presence.This link draws her back to the circus where she witnesses Venom give birth and plead with Wen to rescue her baby. This is a marvelous story! My heart raced when I read it! Wen experiences a deep struggle with her choice to save little \"Flower\". She struggles with what her faith and her parents would expect her to do vs what her heart is asking of her. Beautifully written. It has made me RUSH to read Diana's book Rampant.In Scott Westerfeld's story Inoculata a small group of teens and adults are living on a secure farm. The watch the evergrowing numbers of undead who surround their fences day and night. Young Allison also watches Kayln, a beautiful young girl who she is in love with. One night while talking to Kayln she discovers a shocking secret that changes the lives of everyone in the camp. Nicely told and an interesting take on infection and survival in an undead world. WINNER? TEAM UNICORN!! ROUND FIVE Princess Prettypants vs Cold HandsMeg Cabot's Princess Prettypants is about Liz Freelander's seveenth birthday. In a day that steadily is going from bad to worse she is shocked to find her big gift of the night is a Unicorn shipped to her by her eccentric Aunt. This was a fun story. Meg deftly chronicles the High School terrain and sets up a series of events that lead to a fun climactic ending and a little romance :)Cold Hands is the love story of James and Annie. the have been childhood pals and are expected to be engaged until an accident tears them apart. Loved ones rarely stay gone in the English town of Lychgate, and a courageous act by Annie may be the key to their reunion. WINNER? TEAM ZOMBIE!! ROUND SIX The Third Virgin vs Prom NightThe Third Virgin by Kathleen Duey examines the healing powers of Unicorns. It narrates the 500 year journey of a Unicorn that cannot die or be killed. It's healing prowess is immense, but he also has the power to withdraw the life force of those he touches. The spark he feels with this act is the only true joy he gets in his existence. His desire becomes an addiction ,coupled with a cruel streak of deception and manipulation of his virgin companions.His \"third virgin\" Ree bears internal and external scars due to a family tragedy. As the unicorn heals her he also lays a emotional trap for her that may lead to pain and death. This was a wonderful and disturbing story. Kathleen explores how time, isolation and addiction might shape the perspective of an already alien creature. Prom Night by Libba Bray has the feel ofLord Of The Flies with braiiins. There is little zombie action but ,the threat is immenient. Instead the story focuses on Jeff and Tahmina, the \"police\" in a small fenced in town abscent of adults. The teens move thru their year with as much normalcy as possible, including hosting a Prom. A very interesting tale examining teen relationships and the abscence of adults in their world. WINNER? TEAM UNICORN!!A Tie!!! I have to create a bonus category for the wonderful introductions/debates/rivalry's by the wonderful Holly Black and Justine Larbalestier before each chapters. Based on that the over all winner in this Battle Royale is : TEAM ZOMBIE!!!!

I mean, what other way is there? You may have absolutely hated one (NEGATIVE ONE STAR!) But loved another (1000 STARS!!:D) So I give each story the right to be represented. YEAH! So let's get on with it!!The Introduction: Yeah, I know it wasn't a short story, but I really enjoyed it anyway. I like those authors. So it was fun to read! Read funny introduction! Yes! I don't know why I'm talking like that...The Highest Justice: 3 starsUmm, it was pretty good. It was short, that's for sure. It didn't seem to have that much of a story arc to me. It felt like a snippet from a longer book. That's the thing with short stories (and it's hard): you have to make sure you don't unknowingly make it a snippet from a novel. Love Will Tear Us Apart: 3.5 stars That was good too, though not mind blowing. It was slightly confusing. Did Grayson die at the end? How did he not eat? He's gonna turn into a raging maniac! The concept was pretty interesting, though. Purity Test: 5 starsThat's what I'm talking about!!! This was hilarious, had a proper story arc, was awesome, had unicorns, and did I mention that it was hilarious? Or that it had unicorns? Yeah. The best one so far!! I want more of these! Bougainvillea: Four stars (because of the writing.)It made me slightly sick, which I think was the aim. This reminded me heavily of The Walking Dead. Guy walks in, takes over, calls himself the Governor, becomes a ruthless psycho. Area becomes overrun, mass murder commences. It was depressing and creepy and it didn't have Chandler Riggs in it. No me gusta. The creepy thing I didn't see coming was her becoming the psycho dictator. It was sad and creepy but unfortunately not unrealistic. Team Unicorn 4 Life! A Thousand Flowers: -1 starsEw. EW! EWEWEWEWEW! EWWWWWWWW!!!! I can't unread that. I am scarred for life. Future readers, I would highly suggest you skip this story. It is confusing and nasty. The Children of the Revolution: 5 starsOh my goodness oh my goodness! That was really creepy and scary. That would make a really good horror movie. It's 2:16 in the afternoon and I'm still freaked out. Super scary, just like a zombie story should be. Also disturbing. Did I mention disturbing? It was disturbing. The Care and Feeding of Your Baby Killer Unicorn: 4 starsThat was interesting, entertaining, and I told myself that when it was over I had to do my math homework. Which I really don't want to do but I've been procrastinating all weekend...Inoculata: 4.5 starsNice job as usual, Scott Westerfeld. Gripping, melancholy, all that a zombie story should be. I enjoyed that very much, as much as you can enjoy a bittersweet tale of the undead. I suppose it's a different kind of enjoyment.Princess Prettypants: 4.5 starsOh how I love Meg Cabot. She is just so fun and sparkly and awesome- Just like this story! It was super satisfying and that unicorn totally kicked ass, almost literally. And that High School Musical party...I lol'd. Cold Hands: 5 starsTHAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. Yes. This is a fantastic zombie story. Fantastic. I loved it. The romance, the mystery, the action, the narration, the fact that Cassandra Clare wrote it...all awesome. This is definitely one of the best stories in the book. The Third Virgin: 3.5 starsWell, that was interesting and all, but it was hella depressing. It was beautiful and all, but it was hella depressing. It was a unique take on the unicorn story, which I appreciated, but it was hella depressing. Prom Night: 4 stars Another very interesting take on the apocalypse. I enjoyed it. It sort of reminded me of a zombie version of Under the Dome. I tried to read that last summer, and wish it was a short story like this was. Or even a shorter story. I mean, it had over a thousand pages. This didn't, though, and it was a good story!So, who is the winner of this battle? I was Team Unicorn at the beginning, but am I still? Time for some averaging! On average, I rated unicorn stories 3.16 stars. It think it was my rating for A Thousand Flowers that brought it down so much. On average, I rated zombie stories 4.33 stars. Does this mean zombies win? It depends on how how you think about it. If I decide the winner based on which of the two I think is better, then I'd obviously choose unicorns. I mean, zombies are awful (except for the ones in Cold Hands). They kill people and change people in more ways than one. They do carry diseases! They're ugly and insanity and murderous. Unicorns are beautiful but powerful healers and fighters for justice. They are awesome. I had unicorn wallpaper in my room when I was a little kid. I was a unicorn for Halloween. I had a stuffed unicorn named Daisy. Unicorns rock. If I decide the winner based on which would win in a fight, unicorns would also win. That horn. Plus they can heal from injuries. So pretty much undefeatable. Don't even try to argue with me here. People who know me would say, \"But Maya, you love The Walking Dead. How are you on Team Unicorn?\" It's true. The Walking Dead is one of the best shows ever. I love it. But the zombies aren't the reason I love it. I don't love the zombies. I love Carl, Daryl, Glenn, Beth, Maggie, Rick...the people. But despite all I just said, math states that I liked the zombie stories more on average. This is true, because of the disturbing quality of some of the unicorn stories. You'd have thought that the zombie stories would be the disturbing ones, but no. Unicorns aren't just rainbow sparkles. I come to the conclusion that, even though unicorns are better than zombies, this book didn't make me think that, nor that zombies are worse. Just like the Walking Dead isn't good because of the zombies, these stories aren't good or bad because they have unicorns or zombies in them. They don't really show if one is better, just which stories are good or bad or all right. Does that make sense? Probably not. I liked this book. The authors are cool. You should read it if you want to looks at unicorns and/or zombies in a different way."}, {"userName": "Crowinator", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283407-crowinator", "userReview": "I guess Black and Larbalestier have been debating the merits of zombies vs. unicorns on the Internet for a while now, but I missed the hoopla until it finally spilled over into this anthology of twelve stories. At first, I thought that each story would be a death match between a zombie and a unicorn, but that would have gotten old fast, so I\u2019m glad instead that each author represents a side: on Team Zombie, it\u2019s Alaya Dawn Johnson, Carrie Ryan, Maureen Johnson, Scott Westerfeld, Cassandra Clare, and Libba Bray; on Team Unicorn, it\u2019s Garth Nix, Naomi Novik, Margo Lanagan, Diana Peterfreund, Meg Cabot, and Kathleen Duey. The two editors, Holly Black pulling for unicorns and Justine Larbalestier for zombies, duke it out in the introductions to each story. These \u201carguments\u201d lose their charm and get repetitive quickly, because when it comes right down to it, there isn\u2019t much to say about zombies vs. unicorns that isn\u2019t handled better just by reading the stories. I\u2019m not saying that some of these intro pieces are not funny, because they are, but as a cumulative effect they grow boring. Still, it doesn\u2019t cost much to read them, and they do introduce points of contention in the zombies vs. unicorn debate (for example, is it more interesting that zombies represent society\u2019s political or social illnesses, or that unicorns paradoxically symbolize both virginity and raw sexuality?). I\u2019ve read a lot of zombie stories (and seen a lot of movies), but my experience with unicorns is more limited: Peter S. Beagle\u2019s The Last Unicorn, which I don\u2019t remember well as a novel or a cartoon from my childhood; Holly Black\u2019s short story \u201cVirgin\u201d, and . . . that\u2019s about all I can remember. So, I was actually looking forward to reading the unicorn stories, just to see what\u2019s out there in the modern day, but I ended up on Team Zombie anyway. I don\u2019t know if I find zombies more interesting because I enjoyed the stories more, or if I enjoyed the stories more because I find zombies more interesting, but it\u2019s still the case: overall, the zombies won out. I liked all of the zombie stories in this collection, but my top ones were: \u201cThe Children of the Revolution\u201d, by Maureen Johnson, the zombie babysitting story which was funny and creepy and had a killer ending; \u201cBougainvillea\u201d, by Carrie Ryan, which is set in the same universe (after the Return) as her two novels and continues her excellent storytelling; and \u201cProm Night\u201d, by Libba Bray, which had a subtle, disquieting ending as doomed teenagers, after all of the adults in town have been quarantined or killed, attempt to soldier on with the high school tradition of prom. For the unicorn stories, the only one I really cared for was \u201cThe Care and Feeding of Your Baby Killer Unicorn\u201d, by Diana Peterfreund, which is set in her Rampant universe and definitely made me want to read the novel. Several of the stories explored the dangerous side of unicorns, but this was the one I felt did it best. I also enjoyed Meg Cabot\u2019s \u201cPrincess Prettypants\u201d as a kind of as tongue-in-cheek, light-hearted revenge fantasy, and I thought two of the others \u2013 Margo Lanagan\u2019s and Kathleen Duey\u2019s \u2013 were both disturbing in a good way. (I\u2019ve come to expect that from both of them, though I\u2019ll admit that as someone who admires Lanagan\u2019s short stories, I was kind of disappointed in her entry.)Both sides of the debate concerned themselves with issues of power, violence, and sexual desire (or should I say, sexual hunger?), but I thought it was curious that a lot of the zombie stories I liked had a strong romance element, involving zombies of various sentience levels, while several of the unicorn stories focused more on their dangerous side, often as a vengeful judge/punisher of wrongdoing.Cover comments: Honestly, this book should sell based on the cover design alone. The cut-out of the zombie fighting a unicorn, and the cartoonish but graphically violent scenes of their death match ranging over hill and dale, is some of the best I\u2019ve seen. Not only does it effectively present the focus of the book, it\u2019s hilarious and eye-catching. It's like looking at an I-Spy or Where's Waldo book, but with a sick twist."}, {"userName": "Elena Austrengoto", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81712535-elena-austrengoto", "userReview": "thisn wonderfull book is accion packed , the gerere of this book is SCIENCE FICTION ,"}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany", "userReview": "This was a book with a very important premise: Which is cooler, zombies or unicorns? The whole debate, and the deeply entrenched opinions on each side, are wonderfully reminiscent of the great astronauts vs. cavemen debate (on this, as in almost everything else, I'm Team Angel. Er, I mean Team Astronaut). Two authors, Holly Black and Justine Larbalestier lead two teams of authors, Team Unicorn and Team Zombie respectively, in writing stories. The stated purpose was to determine which were cooler. The real purpose, of course, was to create a fun romp of an anthology. They succeeded.Each story was introduced by both Holly and Justine discussing how this story tips the balance toward or away from their chosen team. The banter was extremely amusing, and reminded me of many similar debates I've had with my friends over the years.To no one's surprise whatsoever, I came down firmly on the side of Team Unicorn. Holly's opinions pretty much echo my own: I don't care for shambling, disease, or the walking dead. I liked best the zombie stories where I could pretend they were \"some other kind of undead thing I like.\" (Holly rocks, by the way. I must find more books by her. Or invite her to my next party.) I had to grit my teeth to get through the creepy zombie stories. Eugh. But I loved the unicorn stories (even the upsetting ones). The thing is, I understand Team Zombie's point of view. Zombies are a great metaphor for human society. They are entropy made animate and a perfect cipher for commercialism, materialism, and soullessness. But I just don't like them. I like unicorns. Even the ones whose farts smell like rainbows, and who live in Fairyland, and prefer virgins as company. It's the same as the way that I can recognize that lots of music is much more sophisticated and deep and worthy than my happy country music; I just like country music and unicorns better. (I feel like I ought to burst into a rendition of \"Fireflies\" by Patty Griffin. Or, even better, Faith Hill.)

Seems like everyone is converting to zombies! I don't blame them, team zombie really is where it's at! Scott Westerfeld and Cassandra Clare's stories have something in common, and that something is also what was discussed in Lia Habel's guest post last week - they both make it clear that zombies are not dumb! From George Romero's slow, sluggish, mindless flesh-eaters, to the 28 Days Later or Zombieland zombies who are capable of intelligent thoughts, are fast and self-aware. Yep, zombies have evolved. They can even become boyfriend material - although that still raises eyebrows if you really think about it. The point is : zombies are underestimated. Scott and Cassandra have both brought up this evolution in their stories. One considers that zombies are simply bored, while the other has them living amongst humans like old friends who smell. As my first venture into this book of zombies and unicorns anthologies, I was satisfied and amused. I picked both of these first because I have a fondness of their previous work and found myself super curious how they would write zombies. I found the Scott story pretty entertaining - I even wished it was novel-length. It definitely has a really intriguing concept. As for the Cassandra story, it was passable. It felt very weak as far as the zombie \"world-building\". I could think of quite a few plot holes behind the zombie existence. Regardless, it was still light and fun.--For more of my reviews, visit my blog at \nXpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2150906-julia", "userReview": "When I began, I thought for sure that I would be Team Zombie! Well, I think that I am still Team Zombie, but I must admit that I have more respect for unicorns now. As shown in some of the stories, they would be useful pets. My favorite story was \"Children of the Revolution\", a zombie story. The best unicorn stories were \"Princess Prettypants\" and \"The Care and Feeding of Your Baby Killer Unicorn\". The worst stories were \"Thousand Flowers\" and \"Highest Justice\". They were 1. really stupid, and 2. boring. \"Thousand Flowers\" really was kind of disturbing and gross in a way, too... In \"The Third Virgin\", it kind of gave an anti-unicorn feel, although it was supposedly was Team Unicorn. That was one mean and messed up unicorn.It was also funny to see Justine and Holly's commentary before every story. It really gave more life to the book.

It has all the perfect stories compiled all in one book. The things I like best about reading books with lots of short stories is that if you don't like one or is getting tired of it, its over withen the chapter. Also it has just great sarcastic/humerous writing throughout it and I feel that keeps it fresh. This book goes through all the stereotypical thoughts about Unicorns and Zombies. Then it steps out into a complete different zone, where you get drunken and or killer unicorns, and zombies that sometimes want mostly brains or is undoubtedly just yearning for true love. Throughout the book before every story there are two people fighting about which is better. There are two teams, team unicorn and team zombie. Each team has about 6 writers a peice that have about 2-3 short stories in the book each. Its becoming and refreshing to have so many writers so I can get a lot of styles in one book.

Overall, however, I felt the stories generally lacked any real bite (no pun intended). Perhaps they were aimed for a younger audience, but I was left a little underwhelmed by it all. A prime example of this is Meg Cabot\u2019s story \u201cPrincess Prettypants.\u201d I would have preferred the stories to have a bit more of an edge to them even if it was intended for more of a YA audience.

There were a few great stories about unicorns, but I loved every zombie story. My favorite would have to be the one by Carrie Ryan, who is a pro at writing about zombies, in my opinion. The best part about are the sections between the stories, where Holly Black and Justin Larbalestier argue as to which beast is better (I would argue that both zombies and unicorns can be defined as beasts).

If that isn\u2019t blowing your mind in every possible way, you clearly don\u2019t have a sufficiently visual imagination...read the rest of my review here: http://elizabethcornwell.com/?p=503"}, {"userName": "Emma Cook", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72875605-emma-cook", "userReview": "I really liked how this book alternated between unicorns and zombies for each chapter. I also like how each chapter was a completely different story instead of building on it for each chapter which was something i had never read before. It took me a bit to get interested in it, but once i got a few chapters in I was hooked. Some stories where much better than others, but i personally i thought that the unicorn stories were better than the zombie stories. This book is filled with fantasy, so i would only read this if you are into a lot of fantasy or love zombies or unicorns, i highly recommend to you.Review Written on 2/6/18"}, {"userName": "nicole", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35523-nicole", "userReview": "my #1 must read from BEA didn't disappoint. a really quick, super fun read. went in as team unicorn, but the writing my team zombie made minced rainbows of the other team. favorites were ones by carrie ryan and maureen johnson (obviously)."}], "description": "It's a question as old as time itself: which is better, the zombie or the unicorn? In this anthology, edited by Holly Black and Justine Larbalestier (unicorn and zombie, respectively), strong arguments are made for both sides in the form of short stories. Half of the stories portray the strengths--for good and evil--of unicorns and half show the good (and really, really bad-ass) side of zombies. Contributors include many bestselling teen authors, including Cassandra Clare, Libba Bray, Maureen Johnson, Meg Cabot, Scott Westerfeld, and Margo Lanagan.
