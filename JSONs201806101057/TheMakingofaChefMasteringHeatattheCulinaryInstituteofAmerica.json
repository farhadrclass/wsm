Chefs? They are some of my rock stars.\nI recently picked up Michael Ruhlman's book Ruhlman's Twenty: The Ideas and Techniques that Will Make You a Better Cook from the library and loved how he takes the simplest food items and actually makes you think about them.In 1996 Ruhlman enters the Culinary Institute of America aka the CIA as a student. They know he is writing a book based on his experiences there but he gets the same criticism's he would face as an average student. I didn't see any of the chef instructors and being too harsh though. They demanded perfection and you understood what they wanted from the beginning.As a chubby little foodie this book was a mecca of just rolled up wonderfulness. I worked in a few local restaurants in my teenage and early 20's but not to the level of the fine dining experiences that this book lets you get a glimpse of. I think in a different life I would have headed this way. I tend to obsess about food, the why's of why it is used the way it is and how to take simple food and make it taste better than that dish that you pop into the oven out of the freezer. This book gives Ruhlman's experiences with that. He seems to keep wanting to point out to his fellow classmates that he is a writer, not a cook. But along the time in the school he realizes that he is a damn fine cook.\nThis book gives insight to the beginning of meals: from stock, to butchering the meats, to chopping vegetables. All that stuff that you never think about when eating away from home.\nI loved it because it gave me a glimpse of a career that I covet."}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "This book stands alone as a brilliant introduction to exactly why the CIA is such a fantastic education for a chef. Nothing is left to intuition or presumed knowledge, everything is taught whether it is culinary maths or exactly how you lay out bones to roast for the perfect stock. Michael Ruhlman did most of the course both training to be a chef and writing about it as a journalist and so the book is rich with personalities and anecdotes.Molecular gastronomy is not something that the CIA has much interest in. It is very much based on French gastronomy. But nonetheless you can't help thinking that building up to the fancy smears and spit foams of heston Bluementhal and Ferran Adria from the building blocks of a traditional culinary education is probably better than just going in one time with gels and the powdery crackle of dry ice cream.More than anything Ruhlman shows what an extremely tough course is this Associates Degree in the Culinary Arts. 21 months of turn-up-even-in-blizzard-conditions or get marked down, chefs alwaysturn up, including proper professional experience not just at the compulsory externship but also in the four restaurants the CIA runs. These restaurants are open to the public who pay for their food, so they aren't about to smile politely at badly-cooked food because it was prepared by a student. At the end of the course, the students can go on to a Bachelor's degree, specialisations such as Pastry, or ones more science or business-based. All of them extremely expensive.But once out in the real world, the newly minted chefs can command much higher salaries than chefs who are self-taught or trained at lesser schools. It's not just the kudos of being a CIA graduate, it's also that employers know they have been trained with rigour, that all the bases have been covered, that these new chefs lack nothing except experience. If you read and enjoy the book as much as I did, you will probably want to read The Soul of a Chef: The Journey Toward Perfection. Also an excellent book. It helps to have read the Making of a Chef first though as Ruhlman has already been through the CIA and is revisiting and so should you be to get the full flavour of the follow-up book."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8036318-kim", "userReview": "The Making of a Chef documents Michael Ruhlman's experiences inside the Culinary Institute of America (CIA). The first half of the book was especially interesting to me -- the approach to the training and content of the classes, the seriousness of the instructors, the techniques and cooking details, the overall intensity of the experience. But it's told from the perspective of a journalist. While Ruhlman had interest and potential as a cook, he didn't approach things with the same focus and absorption as some of his fellow students did. As the story about the blizzard seems to illustrate (Ruhlman drove into the city in a snowstorm to take a practical exam) his performance was driven by basic competitiveness and the need to prove he was not a wimp. He also got caught up in much of the minutiae (blonde vs. brown roue, for example) which fascinated him far more than it did me. I think the other question that preoccupied him was whether or not cooking could be \"taught\". Although stated multiple times in multiple ways by the CIA instructors, I didn't get the sense that Ruhlman fully grasped the relationship between the basic skills (taught at the CIA), experience, and personal talent. Anyone with sufficient motivation and common sense can be taught to cook well; those that excel are driven to apply their skills in more innovative and creative ways."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david", "userReview": "I am not a \"foodie\" and I'm a lousy cook, but I love cooking shows, the Food Channel, and interesting books about food and cooking. This is not an interesting book about food and cooking.Ruhlman is a writer who went to chef school (at the Culinary Institute of America, America's premiere cooking school) to write about it, but one of his teachers told him he wasn't a real chef. This pissed Ruhlman off, so he decided to prove he could become a real chef, and he went through the whole program with as much determination as any of the other students.This could be an interesting saga, especially written by a professional writer, but instead it reads like the journal of a cooking school student. He tells us about his classes, his teachers, his services, now and then rambles a bit about brown sauce or tells us something about one of his fellow students, and just keeps going like that all the way to the end. There are no interesting facts or surprising revelations about food or cooking school, just a very dry, matter-of-fact account of the industry. Ruhlman's writing is journalistic and without personality.I suppose if you're thinking about going to cooking school, this is a good book to get a taste of what it's like. But compared to, for example, Trevor Corson's The Story of Sushi or one of Anthony Bourdain's books, this book was just dull."}, {"userName": "Julie Davis", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2125014-julie-davis", "userReview": "I remember how impressed I was by this book when it first came out. Rereading it so many years later, I am still impressed. You are pulled inside the Culinary Institute and also that mentality which separates the chefs from the cooks.And, most importantly, it is thoroughly enjoyable although conveying tons of cooking information. No wonder I love it."}, {"userName": "Casey", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/350233-casey", "userReview": "The Making of a Chef is an interesting peek inside the Culinary Institute of America, which is the most important culinary school in the United States. Ruhlman is passionate about food, and writes about it well. Had I read this book in the 90's, I would have given it 4 stars.Many things in the world of food, however, have changed significantly. In the 90's, food wasn't intellectualized beyond the small sphere of bay area hippies who championed farm-to-table operations. That's not just speculation, since Ruhlman himself admits that only one of his fellow CIA students really thought about the food. Now, farmers markets are in cities across the country, and people are becoming increasingly concerned about organic produce, free-range meats, and sustainability. When the book was written, Top Chef (and all the cooking competition knock-offs) didn't exist; last year, I had to wait three months to snag a reservation at Top Chef Stephanie Izard's Girl and the Goat (worth it, by the way). But the biggest change is the food itself. When I ate at Wolfgang Puck's Spago in the early 2000's, I thought smoked salmon pizza was the height of culinary creativity. Thinking back on it, the pizza seems like something I might decide to make only while super high and out of prosciutto. High-end dining has changed. The French Laundry was bought by Thomas Keller in 1994, but it didn't become the best restaurant in the world until 2003. In the late 90's, oysters and pearls would have been an out of this world, brand new, never-before attempted experience (I'm sure they're still out of this world, at least in Keller's comptent hands). Today, that kind of dish might get you kicked off of Top Chef, since it's been over copied and overdone. If I had lived in Chicago during the mid to late 90's (as a 20-something, mind you. During the late 90's, my 13 year old self was doing a lot of cooking, but most of it consisted of loaded tacos and chicken pot pies), I would have been doing my best to grab a reservation at Charlie Trotter's. Most of my Chicagoan foodie friends only vaguely know who Charlie Trotter is. In a world where you can experience whatever Grant Achatz is cooking up, Trotter seems like a dinosaur (and if he's really the asshole he's purported to be, he probably deserves it). Nowadays, people know who great chefs like Graham Elliot and Rick Bayless are. They'd tweet about it if they saw them at Whole Foods. People really, deeply care about food.This didn't seem to be true in the 90's. And I'm not saying that because 90's me was more interested in N'sync than cuisine. I'm saying it because things have changed a lot since Top Chef, and the Food Network, and blogging, and Yelp. Hell, even my mom venerates farm-to-table advocates like Alice Waters and Rick Bayless. Ruhlman's book loses something, not by any fault of its own, but because it doesn't anticipate the revolution that was about to take place. When Ruhlman started culinary school, El Bulli hadn't even gotten its third star, so I don't blame him for not being prescient enough to predict the importance of molecular gastronomy. I do wonder what a book about the CIA would be like today though (literary agents, I'm more than willing to write this, if you'll pay for it).Nowhere is the shift from \"California pizza\" to \"European-inspired locally sourced seasonal sharable small-plates (with organic wines and small-batch craft beer)\" more apparent than at the end of the book, where Ruhlman describes his experiences working on restaurant row (in other words, at the restaurants run by the CIA). I get the distinct impression that I wouldn't enjoy eating there. There's some real strange \"health\" food cooking here, which feels particularly outdated. Apparently, the goal of St. Andrew's Cafe, one of the restaurants at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, was to serve \"healthier\" foods. In the fat-phobic 90's, this was done by piling plates full of (fat free) carbohydrates and replacing real foods, like cream, with evaporated skim milk. No, just no. It's hard to believe that students learned to make pasta (and pizza!) as a health food. Luckily, the CIA has abandoned this bizarre practice by turning St. Andrew's into a sustainable farm-to-table concept. I bet Ruhlman's pleased that my friends and I can spend a Friday evening at The Purple Pig, snacking on house-cured lardo and spreading bone marrow on artisan bread. I'm sure he's even more pleased that we can hold a long, and intellectually thrilling, conversation about our favorite ways to cure ham (I'm seriously obsessed with prosciutto di parma, but my friends swear that jambon is far superior. We'll have to agree to disagree). But the thing Ruhlman would be most happy about is our realization that a quality stock is the most important thing you can learn how to cook (I've given stock out as a birthday gift. No joke). Because that's one thing that hasn't changed: knowing the basics will get you further than an immersion circulator ever can."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1415126-matt", "userReview": "It's possible that this book has helped change my life...

I mean who wouldn't be interested in the best rue to use for making the consummate brown sauce??!?!! All right, I know that most of you wouldn't, but to me, that was fascinating. Told with interesting anecdotes and insightful musings, Ruhlman paints a picture of the CIA, that, by all rights, shouldn't be available uness you have attended the school.This book did for me what all good books should. It made me want to dive in to the subject.

I thought it was fascinating even though a lot of it went over my head because I am decidedly not a cook.

This said again, this is only a compelling read if you know something about fine dining and food, and are interested in immersing yourself in that world.

Seeing these chefs work with such short time frames and surprise ingredients and still produce dishes that looked amazing and (presumably - it is TV after all) tasted amazing inspired me to see what I could find at the library that taught more than just recipes: a book that carried some insight into the art of cooking. Hearing that a number of the chefs on the show had studied at the Culinary Institute of America, I looked up related books and this one came near the top. I'm not quite halfway through but it is a wonderful read so far. Michael Ruhlman is a writer who went to the school to write about how great chefs are made - he enrolled in the classes with, he makes it clear at the beginning, humble aspirations as far as the training goes. This changes after he is challenged by his first teacher that Ruhlman probably doesn't have the makings of a great chef. From that point on he sets out to give the training his all, no longer just an author on a writing assignment, but as a genuine student. Ruhlman gives me exactly what I hoped I'd get out of the book: descriptions of the training from a student's perspective, so we the readers can get a well-written glimpse into what taking the chef's training program at the CIA is like, and in doing so hopefully gain some perspective into the art of cooking ourselves."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764075-andy", "userReview": "Michael Ruhlman's account of studying at the CIA (Culinary Institute of America) reminds me of all those crazy George Plimpton books in the Sixties, but Ruhlman is more than just a mere dabbler in the art of cookery.The Making Of A Chef is a very amusing book in places, i.e. his fellow students explaining why they're in school, \"I'm not good at anything else\", \"I thought it would keep me out of trouble\", sounding like a bunch of enlisted men in the Army and realizing it wasn't as easy as they thought.What I enjoyed most was the various instructors' impressions on cooking, some approaching like master chemists - \"cooking is chemistry that tastes good\", other instructors laying a very Zen take on the art of cooking, paring ingredients down to a basic three ingredients - \"that's all you need, everything else is just noise\".

Still, I think Ruhlman's Walk on Water was ten times better.Also, I'm not particularly impressed with the audio version. It's been entertaining while I'm cleaning my apartment or knitting and such, but the reader's voice is kind of irritating and not really very emotional, or at least doesn't express the correct emotions at the time. Also, they have a lot of errors where they were clearly splicing recordings and it repeats.

Life here is marched out in three-week intervals and there is no stopping.\u201d (p.16)At the CIA, Ruhlman learns from several talented instructors. Chef Michael Pardus, who teaches Skills, hammers in the notion that you have to demand excellence in yourself.What\u2019s fascinating is when Ruhlman describes meeting Chef Uwe Hestnar, a team leader who presided over a team of twenty chef-instructors running the formative kitchens.It\u2019s cool reading about Ruhlman\u2019s chat with Hestnar because this was where his book Ratio sprung from.I know for sure that I\u2019d never be able to hack it in culinary school. (Ruhlman even remarks in the intro that he\u2019s had a few readers thank him for writing this book because it convinced them not to go to culinary school.)Just take a look at some of the homework questions and what they were like: Convert twelve quarts and twelve tablespoons into a single unit of quarts. How many cups are there in four pounds of honey? You\u2019re catering a function of 350 people; you estimate that each person will eat three quarters of a cup of potato chips; how many pounds of chips should you order?I thought this book was totally fascinating and I know I\u2019ll definitely be picking up the other books in this series."}, {"userName": "Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76995643-jordan", "userReview": "The distinguishing factor between a cook and a chef is the possession of a culinary degree. Michael Ruhlman had always considered himself a \u201ccook\u201d. While working towards his literature degree at Duke University, the author enjoyed trying new recipes and cooking for his friends, but never considered cooking as a profession. After graduating and realized his passion for food was only growing, he decided to enroll in the prestigious Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Documenting his experiences in The Making of a Chef, Ruhlman realized the amount of passion, time, and energy it takes in order to earn the title of \u201cchef\u201d. This memoir highlights the challenges of culinary school, shares different careers attainable with a culinary degree, and defines what traits are necessary to become a chef. Thus, this is a worthwhile read for anyone considering a career in the food industry. \tMany regard the restaurant industry as stressful, grueling, but often rewarding. Michael provides the reader with a glimpse of the challenges he faced in culinary school, offering that these situations better prepared him for a cooking career. When a blizzard hit the school, Ruhlman called his chef instructor to tell him he was putting his safety in jeopardy by coming to class. Although the chef deemed this was an okay decision, Michael ultimately decided to venture through the snow. The instructor shared that if he did not make this decision, Ruhlman would have failed his class, sharing that, \u201c\u2019when chefs have to be somewhere, they get there. Chefs are the people who are working on Thanksgiving and Christmas, when everyone else is partying\u201d\u2019 (Ruhlman 68). Potential chefs have to be aware that there are no breaks or sick days in the profession. By sharing the facts and advice that chef instructors share with him in the memoir, Ruhlman effectively extends this knowledge to the reader. Further, Michael explains the frequent tests of morality that face you in culinary school. \u201cI\u2019d served numerous people chips that I knew very well were burnt, that I myself would never leave on the plate had they been served to me. I decided to do this. Why had I given something visibly inedible? Wasn\u2019t this a question of morality? It was wrong, I knew it, but I did it anyway\u201d (Ruhlman 142). The cooking industry is a very physical world; the food is either there in time for service or its not. Because of the pressure, sometimes culinary students would risk putting a less-than-perfect product on the plate versus no product on the plate. By later sharing the consequences of these actions, Ruhlman warns the potential chef to always use your best judgment in the kitchen. \tUpon reading the title of the memoir, The Making of a Chef, one may believe the book shares the journey of Ruhlman working his way up in restaurants, as many believe the title of \u201cchef\u201d implies. However, he counters the belief that chefs only work in restaurants by sharing the professions his former classmates at the school are in. \u201cAdam Shepard is the chef-owner of two restaurants called Lunetta, one in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn. Jill Davie has a show on the Fine Living Network and was a contestant on Iron Chef\u201d (Ruhlman 6). This gives the reader an idea of what other culinary students pursue besides Ruhlman. Throughout the book, he is offering different perspectives on experiences during his time at the school. While he enjoyed the intense and fact paced nature of the school, he shared that other students felt burnt out and discouraged, \u201cDave said he was tired, had stayed up late the night before writing a paper on the cuisine of the American Norrthwest. \u2018Food, food, food,\u2019 he said, \u2018that\u2019s all you ever think about.\u2019 He looked dizzy\u201d (Ruhlman 131) \tThrough Ruhlman \u2019s anecdotes scattered throughout The Making a Chef, the reader learns the traits necessary to become a successful chef. After his blizzard incident, Michael shared a conversation with his instructor in which he gave him the key to achievement in the kitchen; presence. \u201c\u2019This is a physical world. The food is either finished at six o'clock, or it's not. You're either in the kitchen or you're not. Much of what was learned here here was why food behaved as it did. But sometimes there was no room for why. Sometimes why didn't matter. It wasn't simply that excuses were not accepted here-excuses had no meaning at all. The physical facts in any given moment-that was all.\u2019\" (Ruhlman 68). In addition, after serving a chef burnt chips and having to make new ones to deliver to the chef, Michael learned that a chef must own up to their mistakes. Any reader who is interested in entering the culinary industry learns through the author that these traits must be attained before entering the kitchen. \tStylistically, the memoir is very easy to read with short syntax and widely understood diction choices. Perhaps this is reflective of Michael\u2019s newly learned communication methods during his time at The Culinary Institute of America. Michael frequently noted how chefs speak in short and simple words, often out of a need for efficiency and speed. \tWhile Ruhlmann offers many pieces of advice to future chefs in the memoir, one question still plagues the reader after closing the book: should I attend culinary school? Ruhlmann provides no clear answer to this question. While the memoir centers around his experiences while attending one of the nation\u2019s top cooking schools, he does not say if he recommends others to do the same. He begins the book by stating, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of e-mails over the years from people who have read this book. Many thank me for saving them from going to culinary school. A lot more say that this book is the reason they enrolled in culinary school. The most frequent question I get is this; \u2018Is it worth it?\u2019 Only you can make that call\u201d (Ruhlman xvi) but offers no further information in the memoir about the advantages and disadvantages of either path. It is up to the reader to analyze the content of Ruhlman\u2019s memoir and determine if attending secondary school for cooking is a good decision for themselves. \tThe Making of a Chef provides a glance of the experiences that attending culinary school entails. The author, Michael Ruhlman, effectively describes the challenges of earning a culinary education and highlights the traits required to succeed in the industry. Further, Ruhlman enhances his memoir by providing the perspectives of his classmates on their culinary journey. Whether one is serious about becoming a chef or simply enjoys trying new recipes, this memoir is a worthwhile read to get an insiders look into one of the nation\u2019s fastest growing industries."}, {"userName": "Heather(Gibby)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7520211-heather-gibby", "userReview": "I am still wavering between a three and four star, I may upgrade it if the book stays with me.

Too often, writers of these books belabor the definition of mise en place or go into lengthy descriptions of things that you, you plebe, could never have heard of, since you are reading a book instead of working in a kitchen. Pish posh.Ruhlman did a great job, I thought, of explaining what needed to be explained and no more. He did sometimes go into too much detail, but he never spent a paragraph defining the dimensions of knife cuts or how exactly to pronounce poissonier or any of that. Were I not in cooking school, I might have done a fair amount of googling. But cooking school has taught me a lot. Which brings me to my next point!This book is extremely accurate about what it's like to be in culinary school. Though I have only been in the program for about a month, and the standards of my community college program are nowhere near the standards of the CIA (you won't, for example, fail a class because you missed a single day), it's just very accurate. The language that is used, the passion, the frustration, the one-upsmanship. Ruhlman didn't get into a lot of the interpersonal drama but I know there must have been a lot. I know that is not limited to the culinary students at my community college.My only major criticism would be the male-centric tone and the heavy favoring of he/him pronouns when others would have been better; sure, there are lots of men in kitchens, and lots of chefs are men, and maybe eight times out of ten when you are referring to a chef you are referring to a man, but that does not mean you get to 'round up'. Eight out of ten is eight out of ten; ergo, do not use he/him pronouns to talk about chefs in general. I need more books like this to be written by non-men. Maybe I will someday.

This means, he is not a chef and has no experience in the culinary field prior to entering this rigorous program. This book is DENSE, especially for someone with limited cooking knowledge and vocabulary such as myself. I am not, and don\u2019t pretend to be, the chef in my own house; sauce from a can is more than sufficient for me and I do not find myself seeking out restaurants to find the best \u201cpalate enhancing\u201d meal. This book was definitely a struggle for me. I did enjoy the story as Michael got into the kitchens and begun to experience a \u201crestaurant-type\u201d atmosphere. The relationships he outlines briefly provide respite from the otherwise heavy culinary descriptions. The immense physical work and speed Ruhlman portrays as being necessary to pull off a lunch or dinner service did stir fleeting excitement and gave me intriguing insight into the intense world of chefs. But, the book lacked the storyline to make it enjoyable for the average reader as many of the concepts were otherwise lost on me.

Ruhlman's experience at the CIA is pretty interesting -- and I kind of liked the endless back and forth on blonde vs. brown roux. I am also fairly certain that this is the experience that started him off on his other cookbooks (Ratio, 20, etc), so I am in love with it for that.That said, the prose and organization left something to be desired. I wasn't quite sure how or why his stint at the CIA was proceeding like it did. I understand he had an abbreviated time there, but why did he have the classes he did? Was he sitting in for a couple of the classes along with a full term skills class? Inquiring minds want to know.Also, as a note about the audiobook -- I understand that it was read in 1998, before certain chefs (ie Tom Collicchio) were household names. But if you're going to narrate an audiobook about a cooking school, maybe learn how to pronounce things like \"gnocchi.\" I also don't know if it was just my copy, but it sounds like it was edited strangely, in that there would be an intake of breath, or a millisecond of a word and then a long-ish pause.

Ruhlman is a journalist who spends a year at the Culinary Institute of America studying, cooking, and writing. There's some very interesting musings in the first few chapters about the life of a cook: what does it mean to work with food all the time, what is the personality of a chef, what skills and mindsets are needed? Besides this, however, a lot of the book reads more like a report rather than a diary. There are lists of ingredients and minute-by-minute accounts of harrowing times in the kitchen. It's entertaining, and could be educational (especially if you're interested in brown sauce), but I was disappointed that there weren't more exploration of what it all means."}, {"userName": "Jill Bowman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12430567-jill-bowman", "userReview": "I like chef memoirs and this was no exception.

Ruhlman learns fundamental skills and information about the behavior of food that make cooking anything possible.
