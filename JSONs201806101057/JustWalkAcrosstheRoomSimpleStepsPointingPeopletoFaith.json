Just a few steps to make an eternal difference. It has nothing to do with methods and everything to do with taking a genuine interest in another human being. All you need is a heart that's in tune with the Holy Spirit and a willingness to venture out of your 'Circle of Comfort' and into another person's life. Just Walk Across the Room brings personal evangelism into the twenty-first century.\\nI picked up this book from the library because in the recent past my church did a sermon series and small groups based on it. I missed some of the sermons due to working with the junior high group and shuttling Jeff to the airport. And I didn\ufffdt attend a small group because\ufffdwell, life is crazy. So I definitely wanted to read the book.\\nAnd it did not disappoint. I absolutely believe that you earn your right to speak into people\ufffds lives \ufffd whether it\ufffds about faith or choices or whatever. And so evangelism like Pastor Hybels writes about just makes sense. You need to have a relationships. Build a relationship. Care about people. And then listen to the Spirit and follow the leading there.\\nI will admit, although it makes sense and sounds simple, for a natural introvert like me it is anything but. The fear of rejection keeps me from \ufffdwalking across the room\ufffd and engaging people more often than not. Although it is interesting. I spent a week or so reading the book and finished it up Friday night. Saturday we were going to the birthday party for the daughter of friends. I use the word \ufffdfriends\ufffd loosely. They are Jeff\ufffds friends. I would like them to be mine. But we live an hour apart. So there hasn\ufffdt been time to build that sort of relationship. So we\ufffdre really more acquaintances. \\nAnyway, back to the point.\\nTwice during the party I walked up to someone, introduced myself, and engaged in conversation. I didn\ufffdt even think about it. I just did it. This book and its concepts must have been in my subconscious. \\nDid we have deep, spiritual conversations? No. I don\ufffdt think there was anything remotely spiritual about them. But I got out of my \ufffdcircle of comfort\ufffd, walked across a room, and engaged in conversation. That\ufffds huge for me.\\nDefinitely a book worth reading. Practical and encouraging all in one. \\n\\n"}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1875709-amanda", "userReview": "Bill Hybels has a realistic approach to expanding the idea of Christianity. It's not about walking door to door or stopping people on the side of the street to preach to them. It's truly just about investing in people. Not too long ago my brother made a comment along the lines of he doesn't do good things for people because he's being watched by God but because he is invested in humans. How true! It's in our nature, or should be, to love one another. Not to judge or to force someone to believe in what we believe in. It's hard when there are those \"pushy\" people out there who ruin it for everyone else. Whatever happened to just taking the time to get to know someone and to truly invest in their life. Then, if it so happens that they decide to switch their faith to what you believe in based on your actions towards them and the word, then so be it.I think this book has a lot to offer about just being a good person who is genuinely open to meeting and learning about other people around them.

Bill Hybels shared countless stories from his own life of how God has used simple steps of faith to lead people to Christ. The examples weren't written out of pride; Hybels acknowledges that out of a hundred conversations, very few of them actually leads to the person making a decision to follow Christ. He encourages us to keep pushing forward - loving the lost and sharing our story. Even if we don't see a lost person get saved, we are planting seeds that God will use. This book was a great blessing to me. Just Walk Across the Room motivated me to step out of my comfort zone and be open and eager to talk with others about their faith. (When we step out of OUR comfort zone, we step right into GOD'S comfort zone!)The only thing that I didn't love about this book was that the author talked about his church all the time. Because I don't know anything Willow Creek Church, I felt like it was a bit repetitive. But I do realize that as a pastor, the church is probably something deep on his heart. It is still a wonderful book, and I would recommend it to everyone who wants a deeper heart for the lost and simple ways to do that in their everyday life."}, {"userName": "Paul Veldhouse", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34144597-paul-veldhouse", "userReview": "While Hybels makes a lot of points about how \u201canyone\u201d can evangelize, he sure spends a lot of the book telling stories about how a Pastor of a megachurch focused on evangelism does it. I\u2019d love to hear more stories of \u201ceveryday evangelists\u201d. Most of the points are told from his personal point of view. I learned that relationship is important. I learned a bit more about how conversion is up to the person and God and I am not scoring conversion points for God. He scores them himself. However, it was all done in story, which he defends as saying most people need anecdotes. Therefore the book is anecdotal (again, all his own stories). I do like facts , though, so if you\u2019re writing a book a few more references and stats to back up your claims could also be helpful.

The chapter about discovering others' stories was my favorite; it had some good nuggets. Hybels emphasizes in some chapters that God created us the way He did for a purpose, and encourages us to \"stay true to ourselves\" when we are interacting with non-believers. We're not supposed to take on the persona of a forceful evangelist/super missionary and toss aside the gifts that God has given to us. We can serve Him with the personality that He has gifted to us as individuals. I really liked this bit, as it's something I see forgotten frequently! \"God made you exactly as you are. He wired you and gave you the temptation and the experience and the background that you have because he wanted someone just like you in this world right now.\" p.84 However, Hybels seems to change his tune a little later in the book. Hybels claims to be \"mildly extroverted\", though I have a hard time buying the \"mild\" part. The large bulk of his stories of people being faithful to make friendships with non-believers that eventually led them to know Christ are stories about him doing the work, although he also includes a couple of stories from his church members. He sounds very, very busy, and I don't mean that in a good way. He has regular date nights with his wife, plus weekly \"seeker\" dinners, plus he pastors a large church, plus he has a sailing group, plus he goes out of his way to always be with people in crowded places, plus, plus, plus. As an introvert, I became exhausted just reading about everything he does on a regular basis! And while I can appreciate that he's serving God in a way that befits his personality, I got the distinct impression that he didn't actually mean his earlier claim about serving God the way we are. There were no stories of introverts included in the book that I can remember. Not one. At one point, he mentions a man who wrote jingles for a living and who became a Christian (who, of course, also attends his church, because why would anyone possibly want to attend any other church?); he states he encouraged this man to stop writing jingles and to do something for Christ instead. \"Write songs that help people go to heaven.\" p.181 Hold up there, Hybels. Since when does a person have to be doing \"Christian\" work to serve God? He says in the beginning of his book that people assume he has constant interaction with non-believers because he's a pastor and he actually has much more contact with Christians, and is jealous of laypersons who work in a secular environment. And yet he seems to only believe that \"Christian\" work is the way to truly serve God. How does he know that God didn't have plans for the man at the advertising agency where he worked? Undoubtedly, there were other non-believers there that he already had relationships with and who needed to know Christ.Also, one chapter is all about learning to tell your story in a concise, effective way to those who inquire. Hybels believes a person should focus on their before/after conversion experience. Throughout the entire book, he talks to Christians as if all Christians became believers as adults (which, not surprisingly, is when Hybels came to know Christ). Never is it even considered an option that someone might believe as a child, so I couldn't relate much at all. I became a Christian when I was 5 years old and so I, quite frankly, don't have a dramatic before and after story with which to wow everyone.There were a few other tidbits here and there that rubbed me the wrong way (Hybels talks of threatening his babysitters, for one... why that would be necessary is completely beyond me!), but I won't list anything more as this review is already too long. The good: I like that Hybels is encouraging Christians to get outside their Christian bubbles, the way Jesus did, and yet not compromise their own beliefs or message. It is possible to love and value people without justifying or \"accepting\" their sin. \"\u2026.even the most \"Christlike\" Christians on the planet will be totally ineffective unless they get near people who are living far from God.\" p.82 \"[Jesus] didn't expect people who had lived their entire lives far from God to be holy when he encountered them. What was of utmost importance to Jesus was that irreligious people were willing for him to make them holy.\" p.88 However, as an introvert, I cannot recommend this book as it seems to disregard the fact that not everyone has the exact same personality, or has had all the exact same experiences, as Bill Hybels."}, {"userName": "Erma", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4795072-erma", "userReview": "While I am not a fan of the \"decision\" theology that is taught and believed by Bill Hybels, this is still an excellent book for those looking for an entry into conversations about faith with those on the outside of our congregations, or even on the outside of any religious affiliation or belief. This book was recommended to me by another pastor who I respect, and I am glad I finally read it. I was pleasantly surprised by Hybels approach to these conversations. This is no school of high-pressure, guilt-ridden sales pitches about sin, belief, hell, and salvation. Instead, the stress is on listening, patience (I mean taking YEARS to get to the invitation to faith, prayer, coming to church, etc.), and always in prayer to God for guidance. What Hybels is really good at is not letting any of us \"quiet, shy Christians\" (and as a Lutheran, we are notorious for this!) off of the hook of \"walking across the room\" and giving the Holy Spirit a chance to start a conversation with someone that just might introduce them to the light and grace of Jesus Christ. It is evangelism that is still daring, but it is an approach that will be adaptable for those of us who do not go for the \"decision\" moment but still need to be making the invitation. I encourage others to read this book. As for me, I think I will investigate the companion material that Hybels and Willow Creek make available, and adapt it to Lutheran theology but with an Evangelical approach."}, {"userName": "Caleb Gibson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12766216-caleb-gibson", "userReview": "Just walk across that room.

Sometimes you plant a seed into someone, and other times God doesn't lead you to say anything really to change their beliefs.Side note: Bill wrote once, \"Suppose you're at a cocktail party and see someone standing by themselves\" (Hybels 95). Why should someone be at a cocktail party? Haha, I mean that was random! Also he talked about a time when he was out of town (alone) and went to eat with a couple strangers who turned out to be homosexuals, but this wasn't the weirdest thing because how could he know; the weird thing was that they couldn't get a table so he decided it would be okay to sit at the bar and at one point said, \"We'd better get another round of drinks!\" (Hybels 80). I have never heard someone say that about drinking sweet tea, but that was just a weird chapter... I have heard a ton of people say, \"We need to hang out with sinners like Jesus did.\" But the Bible never says Jesus went to the bars, but it did talk about people went to hang out with Him!

One of the other things I really appreciated was his acknowledgement that we don't always have the privilege of seeing a person come to faith, but our role in the process is still important.

Just a few steps to make an eternal difference. It has nothing to do with methods and everything to do with taking a genuine interest in another human being. All you need is a heart that's in tune with the Holy Spirit and a willingness to venture out of your \"Circle of Comfort\" and into another person's life. Just Walk Across the Room brings personal evangelism into the twenty-first century. Building on the solid foundation laid in Becoming a Contagious Christian, Bill Hybels shows how you can participate in the model first set by Jesus, who stepped down from heaven 2,000 years ago to bring hope and redemption to broken people living in a fallen world. Now it's your turn. Your journey may not be as dramatic, but it can have a life-changing impact for someone standing a few steps away from you--and for you as well, as you learn the power of extending care, compassion, and inclusiveness under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The highest value in personal evangelism is cooperating with the Spirit, says Hybels. This means playing only the role you're meant to play--walking when the Spirit says to walk, talking when he says to talk, and falling silent when he suggests that you've said enough. Hybels encourages you to \"live in 3D\" ... Developing friendships Discovering stories Discerning appropriate next steps ... as a means of learning to understand the Holy Spirit's promptings. With fresh perspectives from his own reflections and experiences collected during his most recent decade of ministry, Bill Hybels shows with convincing and inspiring clarity the power of this personal, richly relational approach to evangelism. The stakes are high. The implications are eternal.
