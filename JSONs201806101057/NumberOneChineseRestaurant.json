(I used to joke that there were classmates I saw more regularly at the Chinese restaurant than I did in high school!) While there were several different Chinese restaurants in our area, and everyone had a favorite, we frequently ate at one particular restaurant, whose owners my parents had known for a number of years. The owner and his wife seemed to have a fascinating relationship, and the high school gossip I was then loved to make up stories about what was going on in their lives, as well as the lives of the other employees. Perhaps those memories were what drew me to Lillian Li's \nNumber One Chinese Restaurant\n\u2014that, and the fact that Li's book takes place in a suburb of Washington, DC known for its Chinese restaurants.The Beijing Duck House in Rockville, Maryland, has certainly seen better days, but it's still a favorite among the community's restaurants. The creation of immigrant Bobby Han, the Duck House was once a place where presidents and celebrities dined, but Bobby's death left the restaurant caught between his two sons, the more managerially suited Johnny, and the more impulsive, ambitious Jimmy.Jimmy has dreams of getting away from his father's legacy and opening a fancier Asian fusion restaurant where he'd never again have to serve the dishes which exhaust and repulse him. But to make his dream possible requires striking a deal with the devil, one who has been on the outskirts of their family for years now, and doesn't know how to take the word \"no\" for an answer.When tragedy strikes, it may make the achievement of Jimmy's dreams closer to reality, but it also upends the lives of many others. For longtime employees Nan and Ah-Jack, they are forced to confront the so-called elephant in the room, their friendship/flirtation, and decide whether to pursue something more after 30 years. But if they do, how will this affect Ah-Jack's wife and Nan's rebellious teenage son, Pat?Pat, a dishwasher at the Duck House since being expelled from high school, is in the midst of a flirtation with Annie, the hostess, who happens to be Jimmy's niece. While Annie has very little love for her father or her family's restaurant, she's not expecting to get pulled into a scheme which threatens to destroy both.As Jimmy tries to hold on to his dream, he must battle his brother, their seemingly ineffective mother, and the family friend whose menacing presence has always kept everyone on edge. But what does Jimmy really want? Is it making a name for himself, or continuing to bask in the spotlight his father built all these years ago.There's a lot going on in this book, with no shortage of melodrama, family dysfunction, angst, and even a little crime for good measure. While the different situations the characters find themselves in certainly have potential, they never really grabbed my interest as I had hoped. I don't know if there was too much to digest (no pun intended) all at once, or if it was more that the characters weren't particularly sympathetic, but I felt that the plot really dragged, and never picked up much steam.If you like stories of family dynamics, you might enjoy this one. The one thing I truly appreciated about this book is that Li didn't spend too much time dwelling on the food, so I didn't get as hungry as I often do when reading books about restaurants and cooks!NetGalley and Henry Holt & Company provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

This is true of almost every culture. Discordant exchanges are either enhanced or softened by the sharing of a meal, and Lillian Li slyly incorporates such practices throughout this deceptively light toned novel. Jimmy and Johnny Han are second generation owners of The Beijing Duck House, which was the realization of their father\u2019s dream upon emigrating to Maryland. The two other main characters are their employees, Jack and Nan, who have known each other deeply for 30 years, but are brought together by circumstance and misunderstanding. Their story is propelled by the fate of the restaurant, and their acceptance of fate also contains elements of black comedy. As the story unfolds, the Hans and their employees are brought to life vividly, their complex lives illuminated, and this made me hungry for some Peking duck."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5522229-alex", "userReview": "This novel is a feast to me in many respects. First, it is full of psychological dramas in multiple main characters, not only about the conflicts in their minds as they act, but also including sketches of the psychological development in their lives. These owners and workers of the Chinese restaurant confess and tell their life stories, in addition to the restaurant scene as seen from a narrator. As a bonus a work scene of cooks of a non-Chinese restaurant is also depicted briefly but vividly. The second strong point to me is the portraiture of various relationships between teenagers and their parents, mature brothers, they and their mother, unusual lovers, they and they respective spouses, etc., most of them quite chilly in nature, but others bitter-sweet. On top of these two aspects, the book is peppered with philosophical wits and some streams of consciousness, both of which I like as well. Lastly, this novel is not lacking plots and suspension, although usually I myself am not particularly after. All these are crafted within less than 300 pages, quite amazingly."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76455774-james", "userReview": "if you've read \"tiger mom\", \"everything i never told you\", and \"crazy rich asians\", THIS is the next book you HAVE to readLove how you see asian immigrants vs. their children born in america (both contained in the umbrella term \"asian american\" despite being so different)"}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64553705-jenny", "userReview": "I used to work at a Chinese restaurant many years ago.

That\u2019s how I felt reading Number One Chinese Restaurant. I felt agitated and unsettled throughout the entire book. The characters agitated me on almost every page, as they argued with and annoyed each other on a constant basis. This is the story of a Chinese family, the Hans, and the restaurant dynasty they\u2019ve struggled to maintain for several decades. Alongside the Hans are their employees, friends, and business acquaintances, some of whom they\u2019ve known since childhood.Jimmy Han, the younger son of the deceased restaurant founder, manages the day to day operations of the business. He is on the floor, barking orders, sometimes cooking, often yelling insults to those around him. He has plans of opening a second restaurant, the Beijing Glory \u2013 a more lavish, upscale version of what he considers his late father\u2019s old-fashioned and outdated establishment, the Duck House. Jimmy\u2019s dream causes him to plan a desperate act with the help of an old family acquaintance, a godfather-like \u201cfixer.\u201d Although he decides better of his idea, wheels are already set in motion, and the plan takes off without him, involving his niece and the teenage son of one of his loyal employees.The characters in the novel are tied intricately together through years and familial bonds, yet no one seems to like each other. Each character is pitted against the next in a never-ending swirl of insults, dislike and distrust \u2013 brother to brother, parent to child, lover to lover, spouse to spouse. I found this exhausting and couldn\u2019t bring myself to like even one character in the story. Their incessant anger, disillusionment, and disappointment in life was ultimately so depressing that I couldn\u2019t wait for the story to end. I persevered, however, as I really wanted to know how everything played out in the end.The book itself was well-written, although I was consistently taken aback by the author switching perspectives and settings without warning in the middle of a chapter. I finally got used to this, although it was another reason to feel unsettled throughout the book. Maybe that was the author\u2019s intent. If so, it worked. More agitation.A 3 star rating, and this only because I did have enough interest in the storyline to follow it through to the end.Many thanks to NetGalley and Henry Holt and Co. for an ARC in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Kevin Hu", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65701723-kevin-hu", "userReview": "I received this book from NetGalley and was excited to dive into a fiction that dealt with themes surrounding the Chinese restaurant life. I personally grew up as a product of this very niche subculture. I think that Li does some things well here. She illuminates the generational barrier that disallows a conventionally intimate relationship between 1st gen parents, who toil endlessly to pave the way for their progeny, and the 2nd gen children who yearns for the existence of some kind of a relationship and even at times resent the unwelcome gift of toil. She exposes, in rare occasions, that a language barrier can inhibit what communication there is left between generations. Her minor characters, in a restaurant setting where most of the book takes place, have fleeting qualities that lend to the vapid impressions and homogeneity of each character - this is very much accurate to the environment. She dabbles with the organism of Chinese microeconomy and microcosm that would exchange progressive methods of enterprising a restaurant in exchange for loyalty to your people. The cultural differences certainly collide when a business is passed on to children with a completely different framework of goals in enterprising.Even so, I had my qualms with this effort. The title was never really referenced within the story and the concept of being 'Number One' may have existed when interpreting the competing restaurants between the Duck House and the Glory - but this is never clearly defined as that sort of relationship. The characters were very shallow. The context for each character was never illuminated enough to justify and make sense of some of the decisions they made. For as much as Jimmy/Johnny's father was spoken about as the elephant in the room, and as much as his legacy casted a narrative arc over this story, we don't know much about him. The progression of the plot was much too abrupt and at the same time underwhelming. The plot really didn't take any twists or turns - Jimmy wanted the restaurant burned in order to establish his own legacy apart from his father's so I Chinese godfather figure with immunity came in to set up the fire and the deed was done. Nan & Ah-Jack's story felt like a parallel story that could have existed independent of the story as a whole. Personally, growing up with my parents in the restaurant business, I can attest that seeing their insurmountable flaws was easy. But as I grew up, their redeemable qualities began to wring out endlessly. I felt like NOCR attempted to justify and make sense of why our relationships with the 1st gen Chinese restaurant working parents may have been so poor, but failed to illuminate the very precious qualities that our 2nd gen eyes were not able to cherish. The redemption is certainly there and we just have to point our flashlights at it."}, {"userName": "Anita", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76405691-anita", "userReview": "Wow, this book really makes you  feel . The characters are complex and all have a myriad of personalities. The language is so creative and expressive. The pain the characters feel, whether physical or emotional, isn't just an abstract concept in this book. Through Li's painstakingly honest descriptions, my heart genuinely felt pain and anger for each character. The concepts of love and family are also thoroughly explored in this novel through the relationships the characters have. In this book, love and family aren't just cheesy sappy things filled with rainbows and sunshine, they're tears and sorrow and tough decisions too."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11583934-pam", "userReview": "Thank you NetGalley for a digital advanced copy.

There were two secondary characters Nan and Jack, and Nan\u2019s son that I had some empathy for their story. But all these characters were just sad and some of them mean.

Brothers Jimmy and Johnny Han own the business, but that\u2019s where all similarities end. There\u2019s also Nan and Ah-Jack, employees who have been there since the very beginning, still struggling to make ends meet and untangle their complicated feelings for one another. It was a compelling read, with lots of soap-operaesque twists and turns. I especially felt for Nan, a single mother raising a son just on the brink of making a series of bad decisions. And I liked the Han matriarch, with her sharp tongue and even sharper mind. I wouldn\u2019t like her as my own mother, however!So, here\u2019s what I struggled with. This novel is largely a character study, and I personally feel that we should see some arc in character growth. Here, I feel that most (but not all) the players remained stagnant, and that made the ending frustrating. This is a smaller criticism, but I was also uncomfortable with the descriptions and attitudes toward the \u201camigos,\u201d the Mexican employees working in the kitchen and as busboys. There are a lot of stereotypes happening there, and while I can accept that some of characters see these individuals in this light, I find it troubling that this is never addressed, but rather viewed as \u201cfacts.\u201dThank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52277469-jane", "userReview": "Thanks to LibraryThing and Holt publishing for this ARC.I really enjoyed this book about a Chinese restaurant in Rockville, MD (where I live coincidentally, though it never mentions the name) and it's quirky characters working in the restaurant and the family dynamics of Jimmy and Johnny the two brothers who own it.

Its general description is amply available on GoodReads, on Amazon and elsewhere.I truly enjoyed this book. Initially, I had some reservations that it would be another immigrant tale populated by immigrants fumbling along to achieve \u201cthe\u201d American dream. Instead, it\u2019s about dreams and hopes and how they change you by having them.The story quickly drew me into the lives of a Chinese restaurant owner as well as his family and a few of his employees. I appreciated how, at the beginning, Jimmy disdained the business his father had established but later, his feelings changed when he opened his own restaurant. This evolution was subtle but credible and affecting. Various gems included the scenes when a young Jimmy starts an apprenticeship at Koi, a high-end restaurant. His euphoria from being in the rhythm, chaos and beauty of the kitchen is palpable. This high set into motion a powerful longing. His attempt to recapture that experience, that alignment of passion and purpose, propelled the story to the book\u2019s conclusion. Along the way, we meet two restaurant employees, Nan and Ah-Jack, whose relationship was complex and importantly, compelling. These co-workers spend a lot of time together and develop a dynamic, an almost co-dependent one, that reveals its limitations and strengths as they follow Jimmy to his new business. This parallel story grounded the book, providing a somber but mature contrast to the soap opera antics of Jimmy and his family.I\u2019ll note two things here. One, this book is rare because the Asian male characters have sex. And more than one Asian man does so. I\u2019m not being flippant. It\u2019s a sad reality that Asian men are emasculated and/or diminished, especially in American white society and too often by female Asian authors (e.g., A. Tan). And two, I cannot understand or accept how grown people hold on to children\u2019s names, e.g., Johnny, Bobby, etc. It is worse when the adults are people of color. And way worst, when the men, as a category, had often been referred to as \u201cboy.\u201d In contrast, the white waiter in this book is named and called as \u201cTom.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Lolly K Dandeneau", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1412404-lolly-k-dandeneau", "userReview": "Via my blog: https://bookstalkerblog.wordpress.com/'Uncle Pang was always picking something apart.'Uncle Pang is more than picking everything apart, he is the master controlling his puppets.

Certainly not his overbearing old mother, nor his do-gooder older brother Johnny. When he isn\u2019t ordering his workers around, he is making plans, big plans for his future restaurant. Nan and Ah-Jack (my favorite characters) are both buckling under the demands of their loved ones.

Pat and Annie get caught up in a game too big for themselves, and it will cost more than young love. It\u2019s a story not just about the successful Chinese immigrants, but those who struggle to make their way to a better life for themselves and their children. It\u2019s the complications of family, brothers locked in their roles one as \u2018trouble\u2019 the other, as reluctant \u2018savior.\u2019 It\u2019s a matriarch that refuses to give up control to her foolish sons, and love that is never too late. It\u2019s thinking that what you dream of is better for you than what you have and that sometimes we idealize something so much that once we attain it, we find we may not want it at all.I enjoyed the humor, even the selfishness and greed but most of all I adored the relationship between Nan and Ah-Jack (the old fool by far the best character). Everyone seems to be either manipulating each other, fooling themselves, or saving one another. A story of beginnings and endings, of many relationships that simmer beneath the roof of a Chinese Restaurant, that is for some a home and for others a weight around their neck.Publication Date: June 19, 2018Henry Holt & Company"}, {"userName": "Kate Olson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13650342-kate-olson", "userReview": "I was given an opportunity to read an early copy of this title with the agreement that I would hold my full review until publication date.

Behind the accents and the shuffling of Asian flavors is a poignant look at the relationships that build a microcosm of love, loyalty, and interconnection. And the dark side of doing business.Jimmy Han has his eye on opening a restaurant better than the one left by his father's legacy. Beyond the doors of the Duck House lies a dream of opening the best Chinese restaurant in Maryland. But inside the doors of the Duck House, there is love, control, power but most importantly history. Jimmy is one step closer to opening up Glory, but his loyal brother Johnny has other ideas for the original Beijing Duck House of Maryland famous for its Northern Chinese cuisine. That fateful night where fire engulfs the restaurant will be the twist of fate for many. And change does not fare ware for the characters of this story.The narrative is told by multiple characters, Jimmy, Johnny, Ah-Jack, Nan, Pat, and Annie. The stories are told in the present tense but each waiter, manager, son, daughter and business owner have their own cards that fall on the floor. Jimmy is struggling to find his own path through the restaurant business but his family always tempers his full ability. Ah-Jack, a full-time waiter, is tired and suffering from his ailments and old habits. Nan, the manager is trying to raise a teenage child while hiding her affection for Ah-Jack. And then there is Johnny, the brother who comes back into the picture with his own interest in mind.This story is an emotional journey from beginning to end. Its pace is fluid and shifts from present tense to past rememberances. It is not clear initially how the chapters will be set up but this is part of the uniqueness of the story. Several aspects of this story are confusing but the relationships between the characters are most poignant.The interactions between waiter Ah-Jack and manager Nan is endearing. From their first meeting at her new job at the Mayflower, the slow courtship, to the reversal of roles at the Duck House, we see the love build slowly and confoundingly. But Ah-Jack has a picture of another in his wallet. His wife is at home being treated for cancer. But Ah-Jack can bearly pay for her treatment or keep his job. Time has ravaged his life, his marriage, and his dignity. And the Han family has their own traditional Chinese dynamics. Feng Fei, the mother of Jimmy and Johnny is a caustic, matriarch who is self-absorbed and hard on her children. Jimmy always wanted to be a chef, but in his struggle to fit in he always found a way to be an outlier. His desire to be his own story with his own restaurant will resonate with anybody living in another's shadow. And Jimmy and Johnny who are always at odds have a co-dependent relationship as two brothers, one the rescuer of the other's calamity. However, with all the friction between the characters, loyalty and family reign most important.The pulse of the Duck house is controlled chaos. Waiters parading dishes, catching their breaks, takings nips from the bar after a long shift. Each of these characters carries a past and a distinct personality and clearly longstanding relationships with other employees. The combination of all these aspects makes the narrative lively.Lillian Li has composed a novel blending the right amount of humor and charm with tradition. There were at times where the novel felt unbalanced and conversations drawn out, but the story and the characters provided enough entertainment to push through those parts. Overall, a good novel.Thank you, NetGalley, Henry Holt and Company, and the author for the ARC in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3821216-andrea", "userReview": "I expected to like this book. Quite a bit. Didn't. 2.5 but cannot round up as the boredom factor predominated.I live near Rockville, Maryland, where the Number One Chinese Restaurant/Beijing Duck House is situated.

Taking place in a Chinese Restaurant and told with dark humor Li brings to life characters that love, hate, and make sacrifices that keep their families together. The story started out slow but but due to great character development the plot became interesting and involved. Lillian Li is an author I plan on following. I received this ARC from Librarything and Henry Holt and Company.

When disaster strikes, this working family\u2019s controlled chaos is set loose, forcing each character to confront the conflicts that fast-paced restaurant life has kept at bay. Owner Jimmy Han hopes to leave his late father\u2019s homespun establishment for a fancier one. Jimmy\u2019s older brother, Johnny, and Johnny\u2019s daughter, Annie, ache to return to a time before a father\u2019s absence and a teenager\u2019s silence pushed them apart. Nan and Ah-Jack, longtime Duck House employees, are tempted to turn their thirty-year friendship into something else, even as Nan\u2019s son, Pat, struggles to stay out of trouble. And when Pat and Annie, caught in a mix of youthful lust and boredom, find themselves in a dangerous game that implicates them in the Duck House tragedy, their families must decide how much they are willing to sacrifice to help their children.
