And I say \u2018his\u2019 community not only because I know he grew up on Cape Breton Island but also because of the love of the people, the animals, the land and the sea that is woven into every sentence, many of which I read again and again, revelling in the searing truth and beauty of the images.This chronologically arranged collection is composed of stories written between 1968 and 1999, which makes it very interesting to the reader who is new to MacLeod because we see the evolution in his writing and thinking. The early stories tend to be classic and tightly constructed while the later ones are more expansive, containing stories within stories, but are even more powerful in spite of that looseness of structure. I began to have real difficulty leaving the characters of each story behind from \u2018Rankin\u2019s Point\u2019 onwards but at the same time the common landscape of the collection allows you to stay in the atmosphere of the previous tale even as you move on to the next. There is also a more meditative strain in the later stories as MacLeod begins to reflect on the passing of a way of life that he respects so much. He also focuses more on the Scottish origins of his characters and on Scots Gaelic and Scottish legends in the later stories, as if, being older, he is now more preoccupied with the distant past.The characters are by turns isolated farmers, fishermen, miners; sometimes they can be all three at once. Their world is a masculine one of complex relationships between sons, fathers and grandfathers, as well as close ties to beloved dogs and horses. This is a world of strong physical work and women women appear mostly in the background although there are a few fine portraits of women, women who are feared, venerated, or simply loved.As I was reading, I was reminded of the writing of John McGahern who also wrote beautifully about his own place and then I remembered where I had heard of MacLeod for the first time: in McGahern's Love of the World: Essays, a volume that includes some of the book reviews he did for a few select journals. McGahern didn't write many reviews but MacLeod was among them and he gave him the highest praise.This collection has a prime place on my bookshelves."}, {"userName": "John Winston", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16673620-john-winston", "userReview": "If you are a writer, and I know a lot of you are, or you just like beautifully written prose then this collection of short stories by Alistair MacLeod is for you. To the writer; MacLeod has way of combining the elements of writng: description, dialogue, action, etc into single passages, sometimes sentences. And he does this in a way that makes his prose extremely tight and fluid which moves his narratives forward in a cinematic fashion. I read in an interview with MacLeod that he is meticulous and takes a great deal of time with his writing. This is evident in the quality of his work over the quantity of it. For readers; Even if you're not familiar with the settings or culture depictied, if you love beautiful words strung together to make beautiful passages, you'll bathe in these equisite short stories. If you're a writer, read one a week, or even one a month, and your writing will improve."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "April 21, 2014: Rest in peace, Alistair MacLeod. Died April 20, 2014. I have been meaning to re-read this collection since I first read it almost six years ago. Now is a good time for me to do that, in memory of this extraordinary storyteller.YOWZA, this guy can write! Holy prose, Batman! 4.5 stars for this beauty of a book.This is a collection of sixteen stories, published between 1968 and 1999. All of the stories take place on or near the author's native Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. He writes with such a quiet beauty about the local people and landscape, as the people go about making a living at fishing, coal mining, raising animals, and so on.My favorite three stories: BEST: \"Island\"----This story knocked my socks off. He managed to get all the elements of a fine novel in a story of only forty-four pages. It's about a woman who is the last in a long family line of lighthouse keepers. It's spooky and beautiful and heartbreaking all at once. I found myself weeping a few pages from the end, and when I finished the story, I couldn't read anything else for hours afterward. I was absolutely stunned, and I still get chills thinking about this story. DAMN! Did I happen to mention this guy can WRITE?! (Are you rolling your eyes at me yet?)#2) \"The Lost Salt Gift of Blood\"#3) \"To Everything There is a Season\" There was only one story I wasn't all that thrilled with: \"Second Spring.\" It wasn't terrible, just so-so for me."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony", "userReview": "Alistair MacLeod is not prolific, just a novel and these collected short stories on his shelf. Sixteen stories spread over 31 years. Perhaps he takes every other year off or maybe he has a \u2018real\u2019 job. More likely, he anguishes over every sentence, treated like his own child, because the result is a kind of perfection. There is craftsmanship here such that you can really let the book fall open and randomly start to read any paragraph and just be overwhelmed with the lushness of the styling. You do not, for example, need to know what the actual plot if any is in The Road to Rankin Point:The sharp, right-angled turn and its ascending steepness has always been called by us \u201cThe Little Turn of Sadness\u201d because it is here that my grandfather died so many years ago on a February night when he somehow fell as he walked or staggered toward his home which was a steep two miles away. He had already covered the six miles from the village when he lost his footing on the ice-covered rock, falling backwards and shattering the rum bottle he carried within his safe back pocket. Now as I feel my own blood, diseased and dying, I think of his, the brightest scarlet, staining the moon-white snow while the joyous rabbits leaped and pirouetted beneath the pale, clear moon. It was a bright and quiet night without a breath of wind, as my grandmother has often told us. All night she kept looking out across the death-white fields for the form of her returning husband. Her eyes became so strained that as the dawn approached the individual spruce trees at the clearing\u2019s edge began to take his shape and size and seemed to move toward the house. First one and then another appearing to move and take on human form. Once she was so certain that she went to the door and opened it, only to stare again across the whitened, empty stillness of the silent winter snow.These are tales of family, family stories and stains, of lobstermen and miners, harsh cold and rock. Plenty of animal husbandry. The pull of ancestry and the purchase of home on the human soul. Thus, a miner laments:I would like to tell my wife and children something of the way my years pass by on the route to my inevitable death. I would like to explain somehow what it is like to be a gladiator who fights always the impassiveness of water as it drips on darkened stone. . . .Our sons will go to universities to study dentistry or law and to become fatly affluent before they are thirty. Men who will stand over six feet tall and who will move their fat, pudgy fingers over the limited possibilities to be found in other people\u2019s mouths. Or men who sit behind desks shuffling papers relating to divorce or theft or assault or the taking of life. To grow prosperous from pain and sorrow and the desolation of human failure. They will be far removed from the physical life and will seek it out only through jogging or golf or games of handball with friendly colleagues. They will join expensive private clubs for the pleasures of perspiration and they will not die in falling stone or chilling water or thousands of miles from those they love. They will not die in any such manner, partially at least because we have told them not to and have encouraged them to seek out other ways of life which lead, we hope, to gentler deaths. And yet because it seems they will follow our advice instead of our lives, we will experience, in any future that is ours, only an increased sense of anguished isolation and an ironic feeling of confused bereavement. Perhaps it is always so for parents who give the young advice and it is followed. And who find that those who follow such advice must inevitably journey far from those that give it, to distant lonely worlds which are forever unknowable to those who wait behind. Yet perhaps those who go find in the regions to which they travel but another kind of inarticulate loneliness. Perhaps the dentist feels mute anguish as he circles his chair, and the lawyer who lives in a world of words finds little relationship between professional talk and what he would hope to be true expression. Perhaps he too in his quiet heart sings something akin to Gaelic songs, sings in an old archaic language private words that reach to no one. You can see how maybe that might take some time. A matriarch\u2019s grimy fingernails, an old Gaelic song, adolescent desire are all vividly portrayed.There is a milk cow in heat that \u201cmoaned and bawled her passion from the barn.\u201d A shelf of books from the poetry of Gerald Manley Hopkins to a little book on sex technique called Getting the Most Out of Love -- \u201cThe former had been assiduously annotated by a very fine hand using a very blue-inked fountain pen while the latter had been studied by someone with very large thumbs, the prints of which were still visible in the margins.\u201d A golden collie-like dog cavorts with children in the snow. \u201cHe is touched but never captured, which is the nature of the game.\u201d  * * * *This book is recommended in particular not to dog-lovers necessarily, but to those who have experienced an exchange between human and canine; not to those that have bumper stickers reading Labs Are People Too, but to those who know people are people and dogs are dogs but sometimes you wind up together, drifting on a melting hunk of ice."}, {"userName": "Lyndon Walker", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11873643-lyndon-walker", "userReview": "This is just a short but important note in relation to this book which I have read in the last year.It simply contains the best writing I have read in the last year.I was devastated to learn he (MacLeod) had recently died.

I'm mystified -- and a little embarrassed -- that I'd never heard of him. He has a wonderful ear for language and an uncommon ability to give his writing a sense of depth and wisdom. He knows people--actually, it's more accurate to say that he knows a certain kind of people. He anchors all of his stories in the history and culture of the Gaelic people who settled in and around the small mining and fishing villages of Nova Scotia, particulary the area of Cape Breton Island where MacLeod grew up. They are rugged, salt of the earth people, bound to the land, their families and their Scottish heritage. MacLeod's stories rely heavily on the theme of returning to the place of one's origin or escaping to the wider world beyond, and the constant tension that exists between the two.If I had to offer one criticism, however, I would say that MacLeod's strength can also be a liability. His familiarity with this group of people and their way of life allows him to render very poignant, richly detailed portraits of their lives. But, at least in this collection of stories, he doesn't deviate much beyond this template. As much as I loved the writing, I began to get the feeling that I was reading the same story over and over, just different facets. MacLeod doesn't show much versatility. Having said that, though, I highly recommend this book. It was like a master class in the art and craft of writing."}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "Beautiful and heartbreaking, many of these stories will stay with me for a long, long time.

Loved the book then. Gave it five stars here but didn't write a review but did recommend it to my main book group which voted to read it for November.Update: November 12, 2010 Started rereading this yesterday with pencil in hand to underline passages and write comments. This is a book where people and place and their way of life are inseparable. Cape Breton Island is the stage on which most of these stories take place. But in all of the stories set there the island also has a constant presence on stage the same as any of the human characters. Also the history of the people sits there in the shadows upstage and even, occasionally, stands up and comes to the front of the stage and speaks a piece. Having just finished Tom Franklin's Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter I can see a strong similarity between Island and books and stories set in the American South. The connections to place and a way of life is evident, and crucial, in Island the same way it is in Southern literature. The coal mining and the fishing on Cape Breton replace the cotton farming of the South but break a man and his wife down just as surely as the summer sun and bad harvests of Mississippi and Alabama do. One of the things I really enjoy about MacLeod's writing is that while spare and straight forward it is also rich and elegant. A sentence from the story \"The Vastness of the Dark\" will serve as a good example. An eighteen-year-old boy is leaving home and is hitchhiking his way off the island. He has gotten a ride in a coal truck. \"The truck makes so much noise and rides so roughly that conversation with the driver is impossible and I am grateful for the noisy silence in which we are encased.\"(p. 45) The last part of the sentence, \". . . and I am grateful for the noisy silence in which we are encased.\" is almost a throwaway, a bit tacked on at the end, not crucial to the action, but it provides us so much information about the young man's state of mind and spirit at this point in the story. Also, \"noisy silence\" is such a great description of riding in a decrepit, old truck.Anyone who is on goodreads should enjoy the first story, \"The Boat,\" since in that story there is a tension, a push/pull, between those who read and those who find it a waste of time. And that is what many of the stories deal with \u2014 the push/pull of a place of beauty that is harsh and demanding; of a way of life that was lived by your ancestor and so it is to be honored but it is also cruel and a sure way to an early grave; of the old ways vs. the new ways; of book learning vs. learning that comes from using your hands. Island is a chance for the contemporary person living in our fast-paced world of e-mail, the Web, 24-hour news cycles, and constant change to slow down and examine a world where what happened over the years is remembered, cherished and held on to; and the old songs are remembered and sung. Where the past not only has a seat at the kitchen table but rides in your hip pocket every day of your life and tags along for the ride when you leave the island. Island is also a chance to examine the tensions that that way of live has had presented over the last half century and longer to the people who live on The Island.Finished rereading this Nov. 26, 2010. Took much longer to reread than to read the first time. This time through I tried to do a close reading, observing connections within stories and between stories. Definitely a 5-star book. Too bad so few people read short stories anymore."}, {"userName": "Adrian Stumpp", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/649504-adrian-stumpp", "userReview": "Here are sixteen of the best stories I have ever read. MacLeod ranks among the very best writers of the twentieth century from any country. I have heard him compared to Isaac Babel and John Cheever, both wonderful storytellers. MacLeod is better. He chronicles the lives of the rural Gaelic population of Cape Breton Island on the Atlantic coast of Canada. The world he has created is as exotic, alien, and enchanting as any fantasy realm. Cape Breton, however, really exists. Most of the stories take place in the late twentieth century and concern themselves with the passing-away of an archaic way of life. The protagonists are either the last of a dying breed or the thoroughly modernized children of Cape Bretoners. MacLeod\u2019s genius lies in his ability to make the reader nostalgic for a time and place the reader has never visited. He is the true prophet of the New World. In these pages we remember a life that was never ours. He shows us a brutal, poverty-stricken, superstitious world in which life clings to the edge of death with dangerous intimacy and he makes us mourn its passing. I envy anyone encountering this book for the first time. Most first-rate authors are famous long before we come to them and we come to them with certain expectations about their greatness. MacLeod is not famous outside of Canada, but he ranks among the very best writers of this or any age. A rare treat and one that has changed my life. Particular favorites include \u201cThe Boat,\u201d \u201cThe Vastness of the Dark,\u201d \u201cIn the Fall,\u201d \u201cThe Lost Salt Gift of Blood,\u201d \u201cTo Everything There is a Season,\u201d \u201cSecond Spring,\u201d \u201cAs Birds Bring Forth the Sun,\u201d \u201cVision,\u201d and \u201cIsland.\u201d These nine are excellent stories.

One day he and his family members auditioned for a big concert in Halifax, and competed against two other teams. When a producer asked them to trim down their songs, due to time constraints at the concert, he refused to do so. The other team, made up of local larrikins and drunkards, was at the same desperate to get selected to get the extra payment.

I picked up this book for 79 cents at my local Salvation Army. I never heard of this Canadian writer but I picked it up since I enjoy reading short stories.I am glad I got it. It is a collection of 16 stories that are published from late 60s to late 90s. All of the stories deal with following themes: maintaining family bond, maintaining family traditions, working at mines, fishing, keeping up with farming, speaking and singing in Gaelic language, as well as heavy drinking. These are just some of the themes that are found either in every story, either all of them or some. The themes keep repeating throughout. The prose and the unique writing style makes this book really enjoyable. Most stories are about 20 pages long, with some a bit shorter and two that were about 40 pages long. This is an example of the writing style in this book (my own, not from book).\"As he was about to enter the mine with some 20 men, all in his age range, he stopped to reflect on the life that he left behind. He was wondering what his family was doing at this exact moment. His dad was most likely preparing to feed the chickens and clean the horse stable, while his mom was feeding long blocks of wood to their stove, which was falling apart from years of use.\"Something like this is the way every story is written, simple, yet elegant and free flowing. Each story, as other reviews said seem to be more of real life events, yet are work of fiction."}, {"userName": "Taka", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka", "userReview": "Exquisite, rich, evocative\u2014It took MacLeod a total of twenty years to finish the sixteen stories contained in this wonderful collection, and it shows. The prose is exquisitely wrought, with a formal but comforting lilt reminiscent of Faulkner and McCarthy in a way, and the stories\u2014almost all of them\u2014are extremely well-conceived and crafted. MacLeod doesn't rush, though; he doesn't just give you the quick excitement, the easy high, but feeds it to you slowly, as sumptuous meals ought to be fed, and it's well worth the effort to read, say, 15 pages of exposition or page after page of family history or the daily life of a farmer. He slowly immerses you into the world of Cape Breton Island, and it's in a way like reading Joyce's Dubliners\u2014you get to know the inhabitants\u2014miners, fishermen, farmers, and others\u2014as well as the desolate and beautiful setting from inside out.Some of my favorites include \"The Golden Gift of Grey\" (heart-warming), \"In the Fall\" (the little boy\u2014simply majestic), \"The Road to Rankin's Point\" (heartbreaking), \"The Closing Down of Summer\" (philosophical and evocative), \"Winter Dog\" (again, heartbreaking), \"The Tuning of Perfection\" (heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time), and \"Vision\" (complex, richly layered).If you like lyrical prose and being slowly immersed into a world, this is a book to read."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6014887-richard", "userReview": "The stories in this collection cover a time-span of decades, but they are stark and haunting, and will stick in the reader's memory. All of them tell of characters connected to the eastern provinces of Canada, but particularly to Cape Breton Island, where the author himself lived for a long time.The stories reflect the harsh yet fascinating existence of people connected to Celtic traditions and the Gaelic language. They are miners, fisherman, farmers or lighthouse-keepers, eking a living from a beautiful yet unforgiving terrain which exacts tolls in exchange for the gifts it bestows. These people are tied to their traditions, even when they don't fully comprehend them; some wish to preserve them while others want only to escape them.For me, MacLeod has something in common with that other famous Canadian short story writer Alice Munro, who also speaks of a distant yet still reverberating Scottish heritage. Whether he will be as much of a favorite as she is remains to be seen.

Alistair McLeod was a beloved Nova Scotia writer who has recently passed away. However, his writing has been acclaimed throughout the English-speaking world and translated into several languages. He won the IMPAC award for \"No Great Mischief\"and has won other awards as well.To read him is an exquisite pleasure. I offer here a single quote, representative of his entire body of work.\"A single, white tailed hawk glides silently back and forth, sometimes above the land and then beyond the cliff's edge out towards the sea. His shadow slides beneath him across the summer grass but is not reflected within the deep, blue water. It is as if the mirror were perhaps too profound. He does not go far out to sea but circles and climbs and returns across the land; silent and graceful, holding his wings with rigid and controlled beauty, he bears with eloquence the message of his gifted life.\""}, {"userName": "Scot", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/886234-scot", "userReview": "Quite possibly the best collection of short stories I have ever read. I started this tome while on a two-month road trip in the Atlantic Provinces of Canada and slowly but surely let these beautiful stories wash over me, helping my soul connect with a people and a place in a way that very few authors are able to do. MacLeod spoke in the voice of the common people - the Scottish and Irish immigrants who came to Eastern Canada to escape famine and poverty only to seek to re-create the pastoral and simple yet incredibly rich lives they left behind. His early life was spend fishing, logging, mining and living off the land which provided the voice and perspective through which he spun his tales. They are simple and subtle with no bashing you over the head required, he simply lets life unfold with all its good and bad and commonplace and sublime rolled up into one.

The stories mostly take place in rural coastal areas of Canada, with vivid surroundings of remote cliffs, blowing wind and snow, drifting sea-ice, and fishing boats. They engage with a struggle between the romanticism and the hardships and isolation of traditional life in the fishing boats or in the mines or tending a remote lighthouse, in a way that is profound but offers no easy answers, and doesn't get in the way of the feeling of simplicity and lyricism.

MacLeod seems only to tell one story - and this one story of loss (of people, of place, of time) although beautifully evoked is a total downer.

Quietly, precisely, he has created a body of work that is among the greatest to appear in English in the last fifty years.A book-besotted patriarch releases his only son from the obligations of the sea. A father provokes his young son to violence when he reluctantly sells the family horse. A passionate girl who grows up on a nearly deserted island turns into an ever-wistful woman when her one true love is felled by a logging accident. A dying young man listens to his grandmother play the old Gaelic songs on her ancient violin as they both fend off the inevitable.
