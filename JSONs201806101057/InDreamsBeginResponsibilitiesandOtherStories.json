I would spend two or three hours in the Library every Friday afternoon, before joining my friends in the Union Bar to watch a band and whatever else students do in bars.Partisan Review originally commenced publication in 1934, before splitting from the John Reed Club, after which it went through a hiatus (presumably while it sought funding) and resumed publication in 1937.Despite this history, the first 1937 issue is often thought of as the first issue of the magazine, partly because by now it had become vaguely Trotskyist, but definitely anti-Stalinist, a major departure from its origins as a political and cultural vehicle for a pro-Soviet lobby group.This background is relevant to Delmore Schwartz, because his story, \"In Dreams Begin Responsibilities\", was chosen by an eminent board as the first item in the first issue, notwithstanding that he was only 21 when he wrote it and 23 when it was published.In the Womb of the CinemaThe story commences: \"I think it is the year 1909. I feel as if I were in a motion picture theatre...\"The narrator is watching a silent movie. In the dark:\"I am anonymous, and I have forgotten myself. It is always so when one goes to the movies, it is, as they say, a drug.\"Two things are notable about this. On the one hand, it is in the very early days of film and motion picture theatres. On the other, the year is four years before the author himself was born.While we shouldn't assume that the narrator is the author or co-temporal with them, it soon becomes clear that the narrator is watching a film about his parents' relationship before he was born (we learn this half way down page two).I love this set-up. A literary meta-fiction that incorporates another medium such as film, which was still in its infancy at the time.Too Much Carrying On [Potential Spoiler Warning for This Section]Anticipating his own miserable future, the narrator tries to deter his parents from starting a relationship, the logical consequence of which would have been that he would never have been born.Yet, all he can do is protest powerlessly at the movie screen. He must be born. He cannot intervene in his own birth. After all, he must be alive in order to have the dream.Nevertheless, his protest attracts the attention of the usher, who admonishes him:\"...you can't carry on like this, it is not right, you will find that out soon enough, everything you do matters too much...\"Enter a Free and Responsible BeingIn the process of being expelled from the theatre, he awakes on the morning of his 21st birthday.He is now officially an adult. He is responsible for his own conduct, not his parents. From now on, he can blame nobody but himself. He cannot intervene, in his dreams or in reality, in the lives of anybody else in order to influence what happens in his own life. Now he is his own cause and effect.In dreams such as this begin the consciousness of responsibility. The ego emerges from the id. Existentialism leads us to responsibility. I am responsible for myself and I must now act responsibly. I am alive and ready to embark on my adult life of self-reliance. I am free.A Reading by Lou Reed:http://www.loureed.com/news/listen-to...An Article about Lou Reed's Introduction to the Collectionhttp://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-...An Article about Delmore Schwartz in the Jewish Quarterlyhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10..."}, {"userName": "Will", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8350499-will", "userReview": "Camus once quipped that American writers are the only in the world who don't feel the need to be intellectuals. Too many Americans write; not enough write smartly; far fewer write what could be called \"intellectual fiction\" (and among the living, I can only think of three: William H. Gass, Cynthia Ozick, and Edmund White). Consider that on nearly every occasion a story's characters are said to be \"thinking,\" they do nothing more than express their own feelings. Novels have become more and more where characters go to gush and gush about their emotions and wants and desires, but hardly anywhere is there an honest intellectual engagement with the world. These characters don't have ideas about life, much less about literature, philosophy, poetry, politics, film, food, wine, porn, whatever. This is incredible if you consider how much time writers (are supposed to) spend in books, gathering together an intellectual self with intellectuals tastes... and apparently, all so they can write books with characters without intellectual selves and without intellectual tastes. It's become so incredibly rare to come across any character anywhere with a brain, and equally rare, to find an author with one.Delmore Schwartz is that rare example of an intellectual writer who wrote intellectual stories about intellectual characters. From \"America! America!\", his description of a mind thinking:Her words descended into the marine world of his mind and were transformed there, even as swimmers and deep-sea divers seen in a film, moving underwater through new pressures and compulsions, and raising heavy arms to free themselves from the dim and dusky green weight of underseas.How perfect is that? From Schwartz's novella, The World is a Wedding, this clarification of an artist's purpose:[...] now that I cannot compose new works, I see for the first time, as if this were the first morning of my life, that there is only one reason to write poems: the only reason to write poems is for the sake of the activity of the whole being which one enjoys when one writes poems. This is the only justification.Again, perfect. This story, about a circle of artistic friends, reads like The Waves on a more miniature scale, with Jacob and Francis as clear respective analogs to Woolf's Bernard and Neville. The story ultimately turns into an argument for the necessity of artistic failures:\"The fault is not this desire for things,\" said Jacob, \"but the way in which the motive of competition is made the chief motive of life, encouraged everywhere. Think of how competition is celebrated in games, in schools, in the professions, in every kind of activity. Consequently, the ideas of success and failure are the two most important ideas in America. Yet it's obvious that most human beings are going to be failures, for such is the nature of competition. Perhaps the ideas of success and failure ought to be established as immoral. This strikes me as a revolutionary idea, although I suppose it has occurred to others.\" Towards the end, the group argues about the meaning of a Pieter Bruegel painting, \"The Peasant Wedding,\" and Jacob here reaches this beautiful conclusion, clarifying his ideas from before:\"No,\" said Jacob, \"I don't mean to say that this life is just a party, any kind of party. It is a wedding, the most important kind of party, full of joy, fear, hope, and ignorance. And at this party there are enough places and parts for everyone, and if no one can play every part, yet everyone can come to the party, everyone can come to the wedding feast, and anyone who does not know that he is at a wedding feast just does not see what is in front of him. He might as well be dead if he does not know that the world is a wedding.\"And, of course, there's the title story that Nabokov named as one of his \"half a dozen\" favorites. Nearly the entire story is reported action\u2014sure to annoy anyone who abides by that obnoxious rule \"Show, Don't Tell.\""}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54697-matt", "userReview": "My obit for Lou Reed gives Delmore a shout-out and gives the title story some particular love: http://www.themillions.com/2013/11/lo...

I've heard such extraordinary things about him secondhand: comments and eulogies and tributes from Lou Reed, John Berryman, Saul Bellow...anyone who can get those three critical, streetwise geniuses to agree as they did has got to be good people.

I first heard of Schwartz because I'm a big fan of the Velvet Underground. Lou Reed was taught by Schwartz in college and he was the biggest inspiration Reed had as a young man. I then found out that he was an influence in later Jewish American writers like Philip Roth and Saul Bellow, he was written about by John Berryman in the Dream Songs and Bellow's Humboldt's Gift was based on him. He's clearly a pretty serious cult writer. The stories are very good. They are obviously Kafka influenced but they are more realistic and less fabulist.

Schwartz's characters and prose style are thoroughly compelling. More often spoken of as a poet, I think, his stories nonetheless have quite a reputation. They are quite narrowly focused; the children of the (largely Eastern European Jewish) immigrants who came over from 1890-1915 have by the 1930s set out to disappoint their parents' aspirations for them to become doctors and dentists and have instead embraced the life of penniless writers and intellectuals. Eventually (by the 1940s) they reach the (probably still incomprehensible to their parents) heights of The Partisan Review and attend hard-drinking, emotionally-fraught parties quite reminiscent of those chronicled by the equally amazing Dawn Powell in her tales of the same era."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/344533-alex", "userReview": "The title story is a forgotten gem - simple in the telling, but prompting all kinds of philosophical reality/imagination specualtion. We're used to the metaphor now that life can be like a movie: Schwartz came up with it before anyone else I know. Some of the other stories took longer to make an impression on me. However, 'America! America!' subtly probes different perspectives and the nature of Jewish immigrant experience in early twentieth century America and the satire of 'The World Is A Wedding' suggests to me that Schwartz is a much funnier writer than he is often given credit for. 'Screeno' is another highlight."}, {"userName": "steve", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/202976-steve", "userReview": "The wickedness of delusion and pastoral dreamscapes intersect with the beating heart of the young person's desire to make yr own way, the spirit of seeing the world through two wide-open eyes and a dash of hope for a world more tolerant.

I read and loved that first story in this collection, but only returned to read the remaining stories after about six months. This is a collection of very powerful stories written by a man with disturbingly sharp insight into human psychology and relationships. Schwartz is very keenly aware of when and why people are being dishonest, even with themselves. Usually it could be construed as a compliment to say that you would like to meet an author in person, but you wouldn't want to get near Schwartz with a ten-foot pole for fear of him dismantling all your defenses, leaving you a blubbering, snotty mess when he broke down your personality into mechanisms you depend on to deal with the ugly reality of your childhood with a family that was secretly completely dysfunctional and after which you aren't able to engage in any healthy adult relationships. You'd be done. Naked.But why should anyone else have to pay for your childhood? Schwartz's characters ask this of themselves and each other, but there's no answer and there's no way out. Yet he still manages to be very funny! I laughed out loud more than a few times. Just a quick example, in the story New Year's Eve, about a party that was on the surface fairly dull but underneath a whole mess of awkward, self-conscious, pretentious humanity, he writes:\"In general, the guests already present suffered in one or another way from the emotions which has distorted the newcomers. Some felt that they were not wanted before they arrived, and when they arrived they saw that this view was incorrect, since no one seemed to care very much who was present. Thus, corrected by incontestable perception, some of them felt that they would not have been invited if this had been an important party, the kind of a party they had supposed it to be when they felt the emotion of flattery upon being invited.\"In the afterword, Irving Howe writes about Schwartz troubled life and his heritage as one of the generation of children born in the U.S. to Jewish immigrant parents. There are details of the stories that reflect his heritage and I suspect that someone more familiar with that context, or with Schwartz's life story, or with New York in the 1930s and 40s might be even more deeply engaged with these stories. (Actually, many details about life in that era, reflections about WWI, concerns about WWII, and the Great Depression, as well as the details about the households, family arrangements, shopping and entertainment habits of the people in the stories were all very interesting.)

Even Reed's intro is about the man's poems and tragic biography, not really the stories. (By the way, Lou, it is the \"Heavy Bear...\", not the \"Honey Bear...\"). Another intro and afterword try to point away from the misspent life (Maybe a Schwartz biography including some of this best poems would be best) and argue how impactful these stories were in the '30s. I will put this on the shelf, maybe I am not yet of the right vintage and patience to appreciate the subtle values here.The only one I really liked was the final, short \"SCREENO\" which I was intrigued by when seeing in the Table of Contents. Some forgotten pop culture trend celebrated with John Waters-esque damaged characters. It was almost that good. THere are some lines I really like:From \"The World is a Wedding\": \"I like animals. They are interesting, spontaneous, and sincere.\"and,\"In my late adolescence, ... life seemed to me to be Shakespearean. But now as I get older I see that life really resembles the stories of Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\"and from \"New Year's Eve\" on inviting people to parties:\"Since both of them were intellectuals, both resorted to theories about the nature of a party and about each other's characters.

So how come it's taken me so long to discover Delmore Schwartz? In Dreams Begin Responsibilities and Other Stories is a collection of eight stories set in New York City in the 30's and 40's. In what is purported to be thinly disguised autobiography, Schwartz develops a fascinating assortment of characters, many the children of immigrants who have social, political, cultural and financial goals that are vastly different than their parents' interpretations of the \"American Dream.\" Here we see world views that are more than worlds apart. In addition to trying to understand and relate to the old world transplanted, these complex, educated and opinionated characters see their dreams and ambitions thwarted by The Great Depression and their confidence tempered by self-doubt, illusion and disappointment. More cerebral and psychological than sensual, Schwartz's style blends these starkly real portraits with surreal, dreamlike passages that seem to signal the transition from the Modernist to the Post Modernist movements in American literature. I'm not sure what's included in the curriculum for American Literature in our universities, but I'm convinced that Delmore Schwartz should be included with the greats in Twentieth Century American prose.

It's not to say that every 25-year-old living with her parents is lazy - the economic realities then and now make it a sound choice.
