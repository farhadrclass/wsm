The story starts right in the thick of things with priscilla going to her new home and learning her family are vampires she then goes to a new school while \"hilarity\" ensues however it wasn't that funny this is a story where if you take away the funny bits and possibly the over dramatic bits your left with not much. Shallow one dementional characters no romance or subplots and the whole story is centered around how perscilla is the new girl and her cousin hates her and while that is all well and good it doesn't stand on it's own bringing up to many questions that -thanks to tokyopop's bankruptcy- will never be answered. little plot points like her wanting to join baseball, her new friendships, the vampire guy really go no where. The cousins actions towards perscilla go from basic mean girl to down right illigeal and cruel and little miss pink hair forgives her in the end? with no substance and no strong character points this story was as flat as the paper it was printed on. However it was fun and fast past and before you know it your at the end so there's a cookie point for it D-Cover: The cover is a big fat lie What the public sees is this amazing and looks cute right? but what we really get is what is pictured here on this review see the big contrast? on the front is Priscilla with big exaggerated blue eyes and pink hair all in brown and odd patterns clinging to her diary with her uncle aunt cousin and pet in the back in hues of black and purple while her cousin looks vastly different here then she does on the other cover and the style takes a minute to get used to over all this is an adorable eye catching cover if this is the cover you see first and not the other one (which is what people might expect to see on the inside art or even when they barrow the book not realizing that the finish product looks nothing like that cover) CRating: T for teenCompany:Tokyopop (out of buisness)My rating: 3 of 5 I didn't hate it it was fun and I did get though it kind of fast but at the same time it felt forced like the story wanted to be about family and the new girl but it felt tacked on highly tacked on and out of no where. the cover art is sad since it's not what I excpected and is a little two exagerated this was basicly a fluff story with no substance or real story just a quick read and while fun made me want more well drama good drama like why does the cusion hate her? and if she knew she was a human why did they feed her weird food? it's just to mind boggling and question raising"}, {"userName": "Che' Gilson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4319700-che-gilson", "userReview": "LOL!

Little does she know that the place she is about to live in is populated by vampires, witches, werewolves, and other spooky sorts. And that her Mom was half vampire!!! Now, she has to learn to live to cope in a world that think she's the odd girl out when she used to be so popular back home.My Review:I seriously loved this book and I'm kind of sad that they didn't make more. Seriously, I thought there would be several in this series but I can only find this one book.To me this was kind of like normal California Girl goes to Monster High.It was super cute but a little choppy in the beginning because I was having a hard time understanding if Priscilla's Mom and Dad really died or if they just sent her away. That probably needed a couple more panels to make it more clear.THe characters were very well drawn and I adored all the clothes they wore!! Super cute!!There were funny parts here and there and I think the best character was Broonie the Boogey Monster that lived under Priscilla's bed. She resembled a cat with many legs and loved to eat socks and dust bunnies. Her favorite thing to eat was denim lint.I don't think there was anything bad in this book. There might have been a swear word here or there. I honestly don't know why that was added but if you can get by that I think this book would be fine for an 11 year old.Its super cute and I really wish I knew what was going to happen next. I can't imagine why there weren't more of these made. It was a fun read that definitely deserved to continue."}, {"userName": "Rickie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24254237-rickie", "userReview": "One of my first ever Tokyopop manga that I bought on my own while growing up, and it still holds both a place in my heart, as well as a place on my shelf a decade later. The manga is cute, hilarious, and pulls you in deeper than you would expect with the main character and what goes on around her. I really wanted the second volume to be printed so it can join volume 1, but if I have to buy it via Kindle I suppose I will. Either way, this is a great manga that should be given a chance, even if the current art cover Goodreads has is not the artwork on my volume."}, {"userName": "Kassandra", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1925568-kassandra", "userReview": "This was adorable!
