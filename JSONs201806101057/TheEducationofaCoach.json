If you're not, you run the risk of projectile vomiting. In The Education of a Coach, Halberstam has crafted an excellent treatise on the coaching aspect of Bill Belichick's life and it's almost nothing but praise. It stops short of out-and-out sycophancy, citing Belichick's faults, most notably displayed in a rough five years with the troubled Cleveland Browns. But how can you blame Halberstam for showering praise upon the man? Belichick has created a dynasty (a team that remains dominant season after season) out of a ragged football team in an age where the league itself has intentionally twisted the rules in order to \"level the playing field\" which has essentially made it all-but-impossible to maintain a dynasty. That's great and all if you're a New England fan, but there are 31 other teams in the league and even though I've been a Patriots fan since I was about 10, I do understand why people hate them. Heck, I hated the Cowboys back in the 90s when they were the dominate power and my team was the suck of sucks. But for the last decade and more it's been the Pats who have been one of the top dogs. That alone would make most fans of other teams want to puke, but also during that time not only have they gone to the Super Bowl five times and won three of them, but they were embroiled in the Spygate scandal, they were the beneficiaries of the highly contested/controversial \"Tuck Rule\", and they have a quarterback with movie star good looks and a supermodel wife...so you see, there is PLENTY to hate about them and their antisocial, genius, troll-under-the-bridge coach who created all this, god bless his cold, little heart!However, if you can get passed that, and if you want to read about the kind of drive, ambition and determination it takes to rise to the top and be a successful coach in the NFL, this is a very worthwhile read indeed."}, {"userName": "lindsey", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/804476-lindsey", "userReview": "let me start by saying that if youre looking for a biography of a public figure which reads like a novel OR has some sort of life-affirming message, this probably isnt going to be what youre looking for. however, if youre interested in both the complicated history of football (as told mostly though coaching and front-office politics), and like to savor the technical aspects of organizing and executing at the highest level of football, then youll find this an enjoyable read.im a pretty huge football fan, but as a relative latecomer - that is, i only got 'serious' about watching as an adult - i lack some of the context on the players from decades ago. tracking some of the players and coaches and names across universities and towns and teams was occasionally a little overwhelming, but it didnt (for me) diminish the enjoyment of following this coach's path to where he is now. i already respected belichick for his quite-obvious abilities and work ethic, and this well-organized and well-written book only added to it, for me."}, {"userName": "Ericka Clouther", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther", "userReview": "The book contained some interesting insights into Belichick's background and football strategy. The beginning suffered from a lack of chronology jumping back and forth between young Bill Belichick and his father Steve. It also felt like there wasn't enough about his most important time on the Patriots, in part because his early years on the Patriots were somewhat devoid of the bitter politics he encountered at his other jobs, and in part because this book came out in 2005, and since then Belichick has been coaching the Patriots an additional 12 years and won another 2 Super Bowls. I am a Patriot's fan via my Massachusetts-born husband, and I was disappointed that Belichick didn't pull out any defensive magic last night in Super Bowl LII."}, {"userName": "Joey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63327968-joey", "userReview": "The nuggets of information about Ernie Adams were more valuable and interesting than the rest written about Coach Belichick.\"That year Agase was a little surprised when he received in the mail, unsolicited, an unusual document, beautifully bound as if it were a college thesis.\" (41)"}, {"userName": "Ice", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3717381-ice", "userReview": "Pulitzer-winning journalist and author Halberstam focuses on Bill Belichick, one of the NFL's most successful coaches, and the game of football as a team sport with rich detail, exacting research and colorful anecdotes. He reveals what fans of the head coach of the New England Patriots have always known: the roots of Belichick's coaching lie in the essential mentoring by his father, an excellent teacher and college coach who taught his son how to scout players and teams, instructing the author on how to study films of players when he was just nine years old.As an assistant coach working with Bill Parcells's New York Giants in the 1980s, Belichick's \"football first\" credo was born of precision and discipline. He went on to guide the Patriots to win three Super Bowls in four years (2002, 2004 and 2005). Halberstam brings to his seventh sports book an encyclopedic knowledge of football, a firm grasp on the inner workings of effective coaching, an understanding of the systematic roles of the players and a shrewd psychological analysis of Belichick himself as a man and team leader.His book reminds readers that \"residence at the top [is:] as much a product of good fortune as it [is:] of talent, willpower and planning.\"Bill Belichick is the head coach of the New England Patriots and a second-generation descendant of a determined Croatian immigrant family. The Pats have won three of the last four Super Bowls, an extraordinary accomplishment in an NFL that is structured to prevent extended dominance by one team.Celebrated investigative journalist Halberstam, who likes to do a sports book now and then, was first drawn to Belichick when he was a young linebacker coach with the New York Giants in the mid-eighties. He tells Belichick's story as part of the larger context of his family's acclimation to America during the Depression, and he spends as much time on Belichick's high-school and college years as he does on his career as a professional coach. Belichick learned his trade early on (his father was a football coach, too) and began breaking down opponents' film when he was nine years old. The natural affinity for x's and o's meshed with a passion for the game and, as Halbertsam tells it, produced a brilliant tactician and an effective leader who draws from the styles of other coaches he has encountered in his career, from a my-way-or-the-highway high-school coach to Andover Academy's Steve Sorota, the quintessential player-empowering coach-as-teacher. As he's done in the past, Halberstam takes the classic sports-bio formula--one stellar performer's rise to the pinnacle of American sport--and transforms it into a nuance-rich story of individual triumph and social history."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/692475-patrick", "userReview": "I had the good fortune to have started this book only a week or two before the 'Spygate' scandal broke out, and it really provided some context into the whole situation for me. Belichick is a guy who will do anything to win, and it's not inconceivable that this is something he would do. That said, I do think he is an honorable man as well, and I don't think what he did was the dramatic mess it was made out to be. With great success comes the inevitable backlash, and that's what 'spygate' was, no different from Dane Cook being heckled all over the internet by the same folks who worshiped him a year earlier.Halberstam was a great writer, and this book shows his dedication to the details. We're given a heretofore unseen glimpse into the life and mind of possibly the greatest coach in football history, and it's clear how he came to be such. As a huge Patriots fan for my whole life, I thought I'd evaluated the Belichick era from every possible angle, and for someone like me, it was refreshing to see it on display from a new, deeper one. Fans of the Patriots can read the book and see certain Belichick 'tricks of the trade' such as faking an injury to stop the clock or slow another team's momentum, described from his early days as a Defensive Coordinator with the Giants, and then smile, remembering games such as the one in Indianapolis against the Colts in the regular season a few years back, where the Patriots benefited from a Willie McGinest 'injury' to slow the Colts' approach to the goal line, and then McGinest was the one to make the final tackle against Edgerrin James on 4th and Goal from the 1, sprinting to mid-field to celebrate the victory.In other words, Patriots fans will have a deeper appreciation for this book, but I think it can be enjoyed by anyone who appreciates a good character study."}, {"userName": "Roger DeBlanck", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7522543-roger-deblanck", "userReview": "Between 2002-2005 the New England Patriots football team accomplished the improbable: winning three Super Bowls in four years. David Halberstam\u2019s book details how the franchise\u2019s remarkable success rests largely in the hands of their coach, Bill Belichick. In this engaging biography, Halberstam traces the Belichick family ancestry and chronicles the upbringing of young Belichick under his revered father, Steve, a lifetime coach and gifted scout. Steve taught his son at the age of nine how to become a studious disciple of the game by breaking down film and assembling a game plan to think like the other team. Halberstam probes Belichick\u2019s uncharismatic coaching style to show how his scholarly intelligence of football have made him a great leader. Always an inscrutable figure, Belichick, however, prides himself on shunning the spotlight, trying to remain as anonymous and unadorned as possible. His passion for learning is matched only by his peerless work ethic, which has enabled him to create an atmosphere where players abandon their egos in favor of a role-playing system that produces championships teams. Proving that hard work and camaraderie surpass superior talent and strength, Belichick has assembled players committed to the very essence of team. This is a thoughtful book about a singularly driven and intensely devoted coach in an era where the limelight culture, the lucrative contracts, and the excessive egos of athletes too often pollute the team concept. Halberstam has captured Belichick\u2019s life as a coach at the height of stardom. He is a leader who, nonetheless, values his privacy and wants no part of celebrity. The book\u2019s storytelling is rich with insight, focusing throughout on Belichick\u2019s growth as a champion."}, {"userName": "Riley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/310425-riley", "userReview": "I have almost zero interest in football, but my faith in David Halberstam is so great that I got this. It\u2019s an incredibly glowing biography of Patriots coach Bill Belichick that at time approaches hagiography. Part of that, no doubt, is because the Patriots\u2019 Spygate scandal was only uncovered two years after the book was published.

Run the ball themselves, as successfully as they could, and thereby shorten the game. \u2026Have WRs line up downfield to simulate speed \u2013 same with DL. 49-The X\u2019s and O\u2019s are fine, but the Xs and Os don\u2019t always work like they do on a chess board. The Xs don\u2019t get to where they\u2019re supposed to get to, and the Os turn out to be smarter than you thought. 49-(Bill) Edwards did not coach through fear and intimidation, but through a certain optimism. He would tell his players what they needed to do and add that they could do it, that all they had to do was remember what they had been taught. He was not an emotional coach, and his pregame speeches did not seem to vary much. 64-Each player, he felt, should go into a game feeling he had a distinct advantage over the player he was matched up against. 66-\u2026the world of football was one of great insecurity.

Keep it simple. 76-\u2026most scouts looked at other teams and thought that the most important thing was to find out what their weakness was, but the right way to do it was to search for their strengths and try to take that away from them, and make them do what they don\u2019t want to do\u202682-His power came from his intelligence, his subtlety, and his kindness, not from his position in the hierarchy. He coached through persuasion, not through orders and yelling. He would always, in a calm, low-key voice, explain to his players what they needed to do in a given game, and which part of their mission he expected them to figure out and execute on their own. 92-He was very respectful of his players, and he understood how complicated life could be for a young man struggling through his teenage years, that the fact that a young man looked strong, and had a strong body, did not necessarily mean he was strong, that an adolescent boy was often dealing with all kinds of interior problems and pressures and doubts, almost all of them emotional, none of them readily visible to a coach. These were young men, who, despite their noisiness, and on occasion braggadocio, were still unsure of who they were.

What did fit his personality was the sum of his knowledge, being the best-prepared coach on the field. Players would do what he asked not because he was their pal, but because he could help them win and they came to believe in his abilities. 145-They did not want to put their defense in a bad situation, and they did not want to wear it out. 146-But the very sense that he had a choice made him feel better, indeed liberated him. \u2026he had chosen his job, and the job had not entirely chosen him. 151-\u2018hinge plays\u2019 that swing games 160-Poor play calling (power on short yardage to seal game) on (Seifert\u2019s) part, a coaching mistake.

The Bills were less dangerous, he thought, given the superb abilities of the New York defense, if they went to their running game, which also had the advantage of taking more time off the clock. He thought that the Giants could stop Thurman Thomas, even though he was an exceptional back, if and when they needed to, because they were so good against the run. 172-Keep same defensive formation and alignment but interchange LBs for DL, DBs for LBs as situation dictates. 174-in the sixties, when marketing, soon to be one of the great growth areas of the NFL (and the American economy), was a small part of the package, and when producing things was more important than marketing and selling them. 179-There are two sets of standards for the media in the world of sports, and the first rule is that a coach or player can get away with almost anything if he is winning. 181-You can be right, but sometimes when you are right you are wrong, too. 191-\u2026they were willing to put aside their egos\u2014that was rule number one\u2014as he put aside his. 198-\u2026create a system and to play for the future as well as the present. 204-\u2018The more you can do, the more you can do.\u2019\u2026if you did well, you would be rewarded with a good deal more work. 210-Why wine them and dine them at fancy places, when we\u2019re really meat and potatoes? 211-\u2026character and a willingness to fit into the system would be of the essence, not just ability. 211-\u2026on a real team, the kind of team he intended to create, the more senior, more experienced players enforced the coach\u2019s concept of team by setting a certain example, working harder at practice and in the weight room than anyone else. 229-CYA \u2013 Cover Your Ass theory of coaching \u2013 conservative, consensus decision to protect self from criticism 231-Belichick was also aware of how fortune had smiled at critical moments, and how thin the line in making the playoffs really was, how easy it was to fail with the exact same team. 233-Kirk Ferentz\u2019s interview \u2013 two day marathon - run film of a drill, judge how well it went, clip of potential draft choice, evaluate him 237-\u2026of all the positions, offensive lineman was the one where you could take good, strong kids who were available in some of the lower draft rounds and, by dint of good teaching, mold them into first-rate offensive lineman.

Possibly as difficult as winning 5 Super Bowls. In terms of achieving their own personal greatness, Halberstam and Belichick make a perfect match.Written in 2005, The Education of a Coach is not a simple biography of Belichick. It is first and foremost a Halberstam book \u2013 it jumps around in time and place, it digs deep into his family history and contains chapters that would stand alone as superb and insightful magazine profile pieces.The title is apt \u2013 Halberstam primarily seeks to understand how Belichick was formed as a coach. Its a focus on a him as a person and coach with less discussion on the impact that Belichick had on the game of football than you might expect.What emerges is a portrait of a singular man who wants to be the best coach he can be. He emerges very much as his father\u2019s son, having begun his education at a young age at his father\u2019s side. Steve Belichick was a legendary scout and coach who proved the perfect role-model for his son. As Halberstam himself notes, it is a book about two journeys; the Belichick family\u2019s journey into the centre of American life after their arrival from Croatia and Belichick\u2019s own journey to the top in the world of professional football.Other key influences on Belichick were his friendships with fellow football obsessives, in particular his long time assistant coach Ernie Adams. Halberstam captures something that Belichick learned from each of the coaches he worked with. In particular, his complex relationship with Bill Parcells is analysed with the senior Bill emerging in my less favorable light. The book only begins to look at his success at the Patriots in the final 2/3rd\u2019s \u2013 as by then Belichick had learned the lessons that would help him achieve such great things.It is a relatively short book \u2013 less ambitious in scope and length as Halberstam\u2019s basketball masterpieces. As with all of Halberstam\u2019s books, it is superbly well written, incredibly easy to read and thoroughly enjoyable. It leaves with a real sense of a man obsessed with his sport and destined to be successful. Halberstam clearly likes his subject, but the book feels like a fair and honest telling of how Belichick became Belichick.It is hard to overstate the level of Belichick\u2019s achievement. Its rare the coach (or person) that merits a significant biography who then continues to achieve great things for more than 13 years after that biography was published. In terms of seminal achievements, only Sir Alex Ferguson springs to mind.There is another great book to be written capturing the greatness of what Belichick has ultimately achieved at the Patriots. The Education of a Coach was published in 2005 after Belichick and the Patriots had won 3 Super Bowls in 4 years. In an era where the sport was designed to prevent dynasties, the odds on the Patriots remaining at the top of their game post 2005 must have seemed low. Yet, as we all know, Belichick would go on to reach 5 more Super Bowls (so far), winning 2 of them. The Education of a Coach is a highly recommend starting point for anyone seeking to understand Belichick and the Patriots.Any recommendations on later books on Belichick would be greatly appreciated.

I've read an enjoyed David Halberstam's books in the past and appreciated his writing. The literary world is not as full when one considers the books he might have written in the past ten years since his tragic death. However, the subject of this book, New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, is not one of my favorite sports personalities. Indeed, he is near the bottom of the list. That being said, I have gained a bit more than a modicum of respect for Belichick. There is no question that he is a football genius and a great coach. He learned vital lessons from a myriad of sources. I particularly enjoyed the profiles of these friends, mentors, coaches, and his father. Halberstam focuses on people, not plays. In this book, that is a plus. A couple of minuses:The chapter on Belichick's tenure in Cleveland begins with some misinformation and a paragraph that does not give enough factual material. H... states that the Browns had not won a championship since the days of Paul Brown, over 30 years before B... In truth, they had won, under coach Blanton Collier, the 1964 NFL Championship, which was the last before the Super Bowl began. They reached the championship game the following year, losing to Green Bay, and in 1968 when the Baltimore Colts beat them 34-0. As of this writing, June 2017, the Browns and the Detroit Lions are the only teams that existed before the Super Bowl era to have never played in it. There was much furor when the Browns left for Baltimore before the 1996 season, contrasting Cleveland's support of the team against poor attendance at Colts games before their move to Indianapolis in March 1984. However, if Halberstam is correct, the fan base in Cleveland was a bit of smoke and mirrors. He wrote that season ticket sales were about 50% of stadium capacity. In the Colts heyday, theirs was close to 90%. Halberstam twice demonstrates Belichick's analytical skills in a way which might throw negative light on the coach. After a victory over St. Louis in one Super Bowl and prior to their beating Carolina in another, Belichick commented about the shortcomings of his team. In my opinion, that is a backhanded way of denigrating the opposition. The close of Chapter One sparks some dissent, twelve years after the publication of the book:\"The Patriots are not necessarily America's Team, as Dallas had so optimistically nicknamed itself in an earlier era, but they are an easy team for ordinary football fans to like in the new era of football.\"It is hard to forget SPYGATE, which took place about half a year after Halberstam's death, or DEFLATEGATE, for which Tom Brady was suspended for four games. I wonder what Halberstam would think of Bill Belichick today. Five stars slightly waning."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6721045-jeffrey", "userReview": "Read this book to get some insights into how Belichick's coaching/leadership philosophy. The went into too much depth into side characters and needless background for my taste. But a few takeaways:1) Being prepared - Belichick does extremely thorough homework about his opponents, in fact he's known for his film study even when he became head coach. He also applies the same rigorous analysis to his own players, taking care to know their strengths and weaknesses so he can value them correctly and use them in the right situations.2) No one is above the team - during his first HC gig in Cleveland, Belichick made the mistake of appeasing some of his star players and letting them skirt the rules. This, among other things, lost him respect and contributes to his failure there. There can be no special treatment for stars. Also, Belichick found that it's much better to have a team of good players (spread the wealth around) rather than over-invest in a few stars. Personally I think football is a weak-link sport (your weakest player can drag you down) except for your QB, so Belichick is right.3) Invest in people - Belichick would is really cheap in keeping the salary of his assistants low, but invested heavily in their learning. This weeded out everyone other than the passionate, and also developed his network. Today, so many coaches in the college and pro ranks are from his coaching tree, which gives him a ton of insights in players through all levels.4) Public relations is important - Belichick's tenure in Cleveland was disastrous partly because he antagonized the media and fanbase early on. Even though he was \"doing the right thing for the team\", he wasn't able to persuade others of this. Appearance and narrative is important.5) Choose your boss - Another lesson from Cleveland, the owner there just didn't fit Belichick's style and didn't share his philosophy. When the NE opportunity came up, Belichick made sure that he and Craft have shared philosophies and developed mutual trust early on."}, {"userName": "Doug", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1094484-doug", "userReview": "Bill Belichick is the best NFL coach of all time; and Halberstam shows you why. It's a trip through his pedigree, starting with his father Steve, a legendary scout and coach. It follows Belichick through his journey as a young coach, highlighting the lessons learned along the way to the pinnacle of the NFL.The lessons are simple and apply far beyond football.1. Preparation. Hours and hours of film study made Belichick more prepared than his opponents. Careful, focused study allowed him to know what was going to happen before it did.2. Do your job. While he is exceptionally prepared, B also was masterful in keeping his players focused on the simple, concrete task in front of them. Don't try to do too much. You can't win the whole game on one play. A team with each man doing his job and no more is unstoppable.3. Fit beats talent. Sometimes the player with the proper attitude and mindset can succeed where a more talented but mentally weaker player will fail.4. Take away their strength. Most coaches and scouts will find what is weak on their opponent and attack that. Belichick finds it far more useful to figure out their strength and then take that away. It throws off their rhythm and timing. Bush did the same thing to Kerry in 2004. His veteran/hero status was his primary strength until the swift boat ads. Without the central pillar to stand on, collapse is inevitable."}, {"userName": "Writemoves", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10930268-writemoves", "userReview": "How did Bill Bellicheck get to be the premier football coach of all time? This book looks at his early experiences and development with other NFL teams before he became coach of the New England Patriots. Bellicheck turns out to be extremely focused, organized and an excellent evaluator of football talent. It also helps that his quarterback Tom Brady may be the best at his position for all time. The author also looks at Bellicheck\u2019s coaching stint with the Cleveland Browns, which was a bit rocky. He also served as the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants under Bill Parcells, not exactly an easy job or an easy mentor. Bellicheck\u2019s goal was not to be liked but to be respected. Given his successful coaching record in various Super Bowl wins, he has earned respect among the NFL players, fans and management. Excellent sports book about an interesting sports character.

I was reading it as an ebook at night and would make it through three or four pages before I started nodding off. I made it to chapter 9 that way. I started listening to the audiobook at chapter 7 and it is going much quicker now.I was able to listen to the rest of the book over two work days and it went much better! Once I got to Bill-in-Cleveland the book picked up for me. I was more familiar with the cast and had a base knowledge. It was still great to hear all of that glory again. I would love to see a postscript added for the 12 years since the book was published.
