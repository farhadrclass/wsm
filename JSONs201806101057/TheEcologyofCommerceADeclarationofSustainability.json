That being said, this book is more important than ever before, and makes some very good points.

The first, Endgame: The Problem of Civilisation, was written by  Derrick Jensen , and came in two separate parts - the second I have not read yet - that essentially suggested a \"Post Civilisation\" world in which us miserable Sapiens will have to consider a complete revolutionary style takedown of our out-of-control system of rampant neoliberal capitalism, and bring about a complete reset on humanity. I liked the book, but found Jensen rambled for far too long, and allowed his point to become diluted with over compensation into the realm of bitterness. I would still recommend this as a read though, as his extremities do bare a brutal hammer blow to the reader that should effectively shake the brains foundations.The second book, Beyond Civilisation, by an author named Daniel Quinn, was a shorter read and suggested humanity simple move away from its current endeavours naturally. No need to make a fuss, just put down what we're doing and look for a better way of living. At least, that's what I gathered from the books slightly messy construction. My review speaks in more detail on the goodreads page that I wrote it on, but despite it's shorter length, I found Beyond Civilisation an even more confusing read than Jensens Endeavour. What both books are missing - in my humble opinion - is a real clear look at our current system, and what detailed suggestions could be made to replace it. This is where  Paul Hawken  comes in.  The Ecology Of Commerce  differs from the above mentioned in one majorly fundamental way. It's premise is that we need to modify and amend our current capitalistic structure from within, and embrace a nature inspired system of restorative economics. One that mimics nature in lack of waste and constant renewal. Not only this, but business should be incentivised to work harder toward treating the environment more positively (you know, such as not killing hundreds / thousands of species a year through forest clearance and what not) through taxes on waste and pollution, rewards for cleaner energy application and working toward creating jobs through new eco-friendly industries. There's a lot more to cover, and I have to admit, I lost Hawken at times in the more economic side of things (when he does decide to go down that route of explanation), but for the most part this text was very readable, and was the best attempt I've seen yet at a genuine effort to lay out a better way of humanity handling itself. Now for the downside. This books over twenty. years. old. Has much changed? No, not much at all. We could talk about the many smaller details that have arisen in terms of the rise of Veganism, eco-friendly companies and environmental awareness......or we could focus on the fact major corporations are more powerful than ever, and are still continuing to destroy our planet through war, resource consumption and greed. SO many blaring alarm bells are laid out in this book that I had to remind myself that they were being delivered to the reader in 1993. A truly worrying analysis. It would be best if you read this book. It's really quite important now more than ever. I'll leave you with a segment of the book that stood out to me:\"...Corporations are creating a second world, an environment of deadening commercial strip centers leading in and out of our towns and cities, garbage trains loaded with trash and toxins, and Bhopals where 200,000 people are sick or dead or dying. It is a world where fewer and fewer people benefit from the grosser and more swollen acts of commerce, a world in which the small things, the seemingly inconsequential forms of life, are extirpated with disdain, but to our ultimate peril...\""}, {"userName": "Mark Jones", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5870191-mark-jones", "userReview": "In this book, Mr. Hawken sets out to - as it says on the cover - demonstrate how business can save the world, and indeed, should. In order to accomplish this, he establishes a clear twelve-chapter plan in which he discusses the problems that we face, the nature of commerce and large businesses, and potential solutions, finally concluding in the magnificent crescendo that is the final chapter. This is a powerful, evocative book, engendering (and in my case, reinforcing) dark, cynical thoughts about the large corporations to which we wilfully assign so much power. It is precisely because of this that he argues they have a duty to recognise and account for what they have and continue to do; it is foolish to deny that they are the world's most powerful institutions, but their impunity must now end.In order to accomplish this, he proposes a 'restorative economy', in which the more damaging products are priced as they should be - to encompass (i.e. internalise) their costs to the environment as opposed to our present situation in which battery eggs are priced less than free range, and organic tomatoes are pricier than their pesticide-laced competitors. Herein lies a common misconception (which I held until reading this book) - that cost and price are the same thing. This is not the case. 'Price' refers to what we - the consumer - pay for the final end product. 'Cost', however, refers to what damage is incurred in the creation, use and disposal of this product. Is the terrible and irreversible cost of utter annihilation of our ancient woodlands reflected in the price of cheap clear-cut timber? No, it is not. In buying products indiscriminately, in making un-informed decisions, we are endorsing the terrible behaviour in which our businesses engage - as he states - the till is the polling station of our world, and to willingly purchase battery eggs marks you as uninformed, or a wicked, worthless piece of shit.Through the central section of his work, Hawken gives some important lessons regarding the nature of economics and this commerce-dominated world which we have wrought, demonstrating the astonishing accomplishment that businesses truly are, being the most efficient form of human endeavour ever conceived, however terribly flawed they may be. He demonstrates that the instinct to engage in commerce is just as intrinsic to our nature as is the desire to protect and nurture. Corporations are incapable of engaging in the latter, not because they are specifically wrought as institutionalised evil (though this is what they sometimes become), but because their design is intended to generate a single outcome: profits. In such an environment, a large business cannot be expected to take into consideration externalities such as environmental damage, because such things are simply irrelevant to their stated goals. Businesses are creatures of the marketplace, created and fed by its fluctuations and demands. If customers demand the cheapest possible product, a business is required to pursue whatever path is necessary to achieve this. Even if it is environmental mutilation. If, however, the market demands ethically-sourced eggs, then business shall provide.The problem, then, is not that business must be annihilated for us to continue, but that business must be fundamentally reorganised in order for us to continue. This entails us, the human beings of the world, thus far driven into a silent serfdom, taking command of the marketplace and the world of business through the instrument of government, and making just a few fundamental changes. The most significant of these is that we must ensure that customers pay the full cost of the products that they buy, which means environmental damage is incorporated into what we pay, thus giving business the incentive to reduce the damage that they cause in order to reduce costs - and thus, prices. The end result is that the least-destructive product will always cost - and be priced - the least - a profound contrast with our present situation.Herein lies the core of Hawkin's philosophy - that we must not try to change our very nature, but that we must employ it in better ways. My feelings regarding large corporations when I started this book were that they must be utterly annihilated in order for humanity to restore the world that has created it. My belief was that corporations are intrinsically wicked, destructive entities, and the people who engage in their management and propagation are nothing more than despicable criminals. Paul Hawken has succeeded in showing that business is just as necessary to our lives as government, and we must understand the natures of both as well as we understand our own proclivities in order to create the utopian world of a restorative economy, which is not the far-off fantasy which marketing groups, executives and corporate lawyers would like you to think."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/209917-amanda", "userReview": "Paul Hawken states: If capitalism has one pervasive untruth, it is the delusion that business is an open, linear system: that through resource extraction and technology, growth is always possible, given sufficient capital and will (p. 32).If this book has one main purpose, it is to imagine and describe the ways business can act that are restorative to society and the environment. Restoration is not a business term. But then, neither is degradation (p. 58).Mr. Hawken not only allows me to imagine the ways that business can act, but he has inspired me to become engaged in the process and to pursue a new career path: design. Why \"manage\" existing systems when they are broken? Let's create new ones that work. The Ecology of Commerce opened up a new way of thinking that was unavailable to me in my recently completed public health training; training that relied on learning about existing practices and partial solutions; examples include, current regulation (non)practices presented in the context environmental \"health\" sciences coursework, and the limits of community organizing as presented in books like \"No Safe Place\" (Patterson, 1998).Mr. Hawken continues:To restore is to make something well again. It is mending the world. People have to believe there will be a future in order to look forward. To live in that future, we require a design. To pay the bills from the past, we need a means. To act we need a way to serve. For those who say that times are tough, that we can ill afford sweeping changes because the existing system is already broke or hobbled, consider that the U.S. and the former U.S.S.R. spent over $10 trillon on the Cold War, enough money to replace the entire infrastructure of the world, every school, every hospital, every roadway, every building, and farm. In other words, we bought and sold the whole world in order to defeat a political movement. To now assert that we don't have resources to build a restorative economy is ironic, since the threats that we face today are actually happening, whereas the threats of the post-war nuclear stand-off were about the possibility of destruction (p. 58). [I wonder what Mr. Hawken would say about our current war in Iraq?]In my next professional endeavor I hope to marry restorative social and business practices and I thank Mr. Hawken for lighting the way."}, {"userName": "Gerald Prokop", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2297618-gerald-prokop", "userReview": "The fact that this book was written in 1992 and it's still not outdated secures my hopelessness for humanity. If it is possible to reconcile capitalism with ecology, this book offers a lot of insightful and well-reasoned ways to do it. I really appreciated how Hawken thinks within the languages of business and economics to describe ecological problems and propose solutions to the crisis our planet is in. My fear is that there is a built-in barrier at the very core of business, capital and economics--in which case bigger, tougher questions need to be asked. Then again, with so much at stake, doing nothing is the worst option. This book successfully shows that there are many options.The thing that stuck the most with me was the concept of externalizing costs. A main point of Hawken's is that companies should be responsible for the real costs of their activities. For instance, a company that decimates an area, ruining it for future generations (for business use or otherwise) they are handing those costs down to others while their profits remain unaffected. Businesses have no incentive to protect ecology or long-term sustainability since it is of no cost to them.While this is a good way to think about the relationship between ecology and business, the inherently interdependent nature of ecology leaves a lot of questions that are too big to wrap your mind around. How much should it cost to dump a chemical down the drain when we have no idea what the effect might be to complex ecosystems across unknowable spans of time and space? At the same time, if our species is smart enough to do the amount of damage we have in mere thousands of years, aren't we smart enough to do better?"}, {"userName": "Yaru Lin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41103848-yaru-lin", "userReview": "This book formalizes those nagging little voices in the back of our heads, that \"the cash register is the daily voting booth in democratic capitalism\", and that one of the greatest flaws of the modern marketplace is how efficiently it has externalized the cost and losses of destroying the earth to taxpayers, away from corporate profits. Will we ever be able to remove the incentives to continue manufacturing waste as well as the conflict between being \"economic\" and being \"sustainable\"? Can we move on to biodegradable consumer products without antagonizing minority and lower-income groups by forcing them to make sacrifices in lifestyle and income? Can we create a \"cyclical, restorative economy\" in which designers account for the future utility of a product and avoidance of waste from its inception?

Written shortly after my birth this book describes technology which existed at the time and still sounds incredibly futuristic to me. He describes ways to use all industrial byproducts as fresh materials for other industries and explains why in any case where this isn't possible we must find an alternative. Throwing away trash, indeed the entire concept of trash, is suicidal. We are using up our dear planet when we should - and profitably could! - be building him up.Much like a would be dieter our corporations are choosing short term profits over long term sustainable gain. I'm afraid telling them it's for their own good will not work. They would love to sell us gas masks after they pollute the air past breathability. It's up to us, the small business owners, to design our businesses in sustainable fashions and to educate all of our friends and customers about the human cost of cheaper chocolates and cottons. It's up to all of us, as inhabitants of this Earth to write a dozen letters, to buy sustainably made and locally grown.

That's also the sadness: the issues that Hawken describes are still issues today. In twenty years, our society still has not brought into symbiosis the divergent needs of ecology and commerce. Hawken's proposed solutions, along the lines of replacing negative economic incentives (taxes on income, profit, savings) with Pigouvian taxes and other sustainability fees, seem both mathematically and politically plausible. That is, of course, if you ignore the popular mores of our society; it's much easier to capture the average American's attention with an NFL game or an episode of Jersey Shore than with the idealized concept of an America with high petrol costs but no income tax. I only give it 3/5 because, as a contemporary read, I think readers can do better. If this were 1995, it would get a 5!

It's always about choices and making them with actual knowledge of the real costs.The problem is, then-current and now-current business still have the same philosopy - make money at all costs. Then, society (the taxpayers as well as the non-taxpayers) end up bearing the brunt of the REAL costs to society and the environment.Hawkin lays out a semi-theoretical framework for ecologically restorative businesses that at the time had a few examples in the real world.

I was very wrong on that count, but the hope is still there, somewhere, and the ideas remain cogent.The basic premise is that we don't have to completely abandon everything we've built, that we can reorganize our society, our manufacturing processes, our corporate practices, in ways that are beneficial for all and sustainable to the biosphere.

Hawken envisions a world where being \"sustainable\" is as easy as falling off a log. Our government, societal and economic systems are designed to add value, rather than take it away. Hawken reviews some basic tenants of ecological economics, including green taxes such as carbon taxes that are revenue neutral because they are offset by reductions in other taxes like income taxes (the principle of tax what we don't want (carbon, pollution) and don't tax what we do want (work, income, etc).

The authors describe in detail everything that is wrong, being done wrong, and will have a catastrophic result in our near and distant future. These books, rather than being about environmental solutions are only about environmental problems. Their purpose seems more to instill fear and resignation than to point to possible solutions. The first chapters of The Ecology of Commerce led me to fear it belonged to that class of books. However unlike those books, solutions are provided in the later chapters that mitigate the doom found earlier in the book. After establishing the ills of our current economic system run amok, Hawken proposes fairly reasonable solutions to counteract current processes.\tFrom the beginning, Hawken seems prone to a style of writing that focuses on creating series of extremely quotable one-liners with sufficient connective prose to allow some ease of reading. This style is perhaps an adaptation to the current media landscape, with its focus on terse, easily-repeatable sound-bites, however it prevents the author from dealing too deeply with any topic. Language aside, Hawken's assessment is quite correct, and he provides copious notes and supporting references.\tThe book turned a corner for me when I reached chapter 5. Rather than simply listing problems, Hawken began actually proposing some workable solutions including some novel takes on the concept of green taxes as well as the creation of utilities to manage common resources. Still, I found some of his concepts difficult to accept. In chapter 7 Hawken describes the concept of \u201cGuardian\u201d and \u201cCommercial\u201d behaviors (Jacobs, Jane, 1993). Hawken proposes that governments should be limited to acting as protectors of the common good and leave all commercial activity, and its associated innovation, to business. I would agree with this argument only partially. The presence of commercial activities within the government does indeed corrupt its purpose and prevent it from fulfilling its \u201cguardian\u201d role. However I do not feel that the corresponding argument is true of business. Rather I believe that businesses, in addition to their consumer role, must take on some of the guardian role as well. That business has typically failed in guardianship roles thus far is more a result of poorly structured businesses not truly recognizing what is in their best interest over the long term. It is not an intrinsic characteristic of business in general. As a counterexample to Hawken's argument I would offer the sites that we are scheduled to visit during this course. These organizations seem to have succeeded in both the \u201cguardian\u201d and \u201ccommercial\u201d roles. \tMuch of the argument put forth in this book, particularly those put forth in chapter 7 When an Ethic is not an Ethic, suggest the need for new ethics rather than simply new controls on business. In its role as protector government can certainly legislate new controls to allow markets to operate more fairly, but can they go so far as to develop a new ethic within business? Hawken writes, \u201cCompanies must re-envision and [re-imagine] themselves as cyclical corporations whose products either literally disappear into harmless components or are so specific and targeted to a specific function that there is no spillover effect\u201d. This does not seem like something that can be legislated. Green taxes can be instituted to bring prices in line with their actual cost, but unless the overall way of doing business is changed and monetary profit remains central, it will only be a matter of time until someone discovers a way to exploit the new system and circumvent government controls. Although Hawken's recommendations provide a broad menu of controls from which a protective government could select, there seems to be little discussion about changing how we think about money and material goods. It leads me to question whether any of these measures are merely treating symptoms or the actual disease.\tOne idea I found particularly fascinating was intelligent-products/products-of-service. It is suggested that companies be responsible for the durable goods that they produce throughout the lifetime of the product. A consumer would purchase the device, use it for a period, and then return it to an \u201cun-shopping\u201d center. There the original manufacturer would be responsible for recovering the materials from the device and re-using them. I imagine that industrial and consumer product design would need to change dramatically if producers were required to account not only for how a product would be used, but how it would be disassembled and re-used. Certainly this would affect the current design-trends in consumer electronics. Currently, new devices are being made which are completely non-serviceable. Their batteries cannot even be removed and replaced when they reach their end of life. Would this design still make sense if the companies themselves had to disassemble and re-use the components themselves? Would designed obsolescence still be a principle practiced by the major device manufacturers? \tOverall, while I found the bombastic language of the first several chapters frustrating. I found the problems of the current economy well stated and many novel solutions presented. While I believe that some of Hawken's solutions do not go far enough toward addressing the root issues of the economy, they are nevertheless a very good start."}, {"userName": "Juliana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55463791-juliana", "userReview": "Excepcional, no puede faltar en la lista de lectura de las personas interesadas en crear un comercio y desarrollo sano y sostenible, sin necesariamente ser un activista o humanista, si no desde un enfoque empresarial."}, {"userName": "DavidJsays", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75592530-davidjsays", "userReview": "Don't remember details from it, but I remember it being important."}, {"userName": "YanKai Kee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76550802-yankai-kee", "userReview": "really good"}, {"userName": "Preston Kutney", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9402537-preston-kutney", "userReview": "\"The Inestimable gift of a future\"The Ecology of Commerce is a sprawling, optimistic, and innovative work, that sows the seeds for a lot of the business sustainability ideas that have been popularized and adapted in recent years. It is almost 20 years old, but most of the ideas are still visionary, which says as much about the pace of progress as it does about Paul Hawken's intellect.\u00a0The ideas presented for business as society fall into one of three buckets:1. Obey the \"waste equals food\" principle and entirely eliminate waste from our industrial production, tranforming to a circular economy.\u00a02. Change from an economy based on carbon to one based on hydrogen and sunshine by\u00a0reversing historical energy incentives.\u00a03. Create systems of feedback and accountability that support and strengthen restorative behavior, and promote long-term restoration while penalizing short-termism.\u00a0One of my favorite case studies from the book was a group of Dutch companies that developed a circular cooperative. The cooperative included coal fired power plants, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical company specializing in biotechnology, a sheet rock plant, concrete producers, a producer of sulfuric acid, the municipal heating authority, a fishfarm, some green houses, and local farms:- power plant recycles waste heat as steam to pharma company, greenhouses, fish farm, and city.\u00a0- oil refinery produces waste sulfur-gas mixture that is separated, with gas sold to power plant and sulfur to chemical company.\u00a0- coal fired power plant sends fly ash to concrete plant.\u00a0- fish farm sludge goes to local farmers as fertilizer.\u00a0- pharma company waste treated and used as fertilizer.\u00a0This kind of efficiency capture and waste reduction is so satisfying to me and I love reading about it. Shortcomings of the book are its lack of structure and outdated references to global trends that have shifted a little. A lot of the structure emerges in Hawken's next book, Natural Capitalism, and knowing that led me to forgive some of the scattered ideas."}, {"userName": "Roger Gloss", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32904984-roger-gloss", "userReview": "This is the book, originally published in 1993, that gave Ray Anderson, CEO of Interface Carpet, his \u201cspear in the chest\u201d epiphany, which in turn set Anderson on a mission to make his company carbon neutral, with zero negative environmental impact, by 2020. The original version of the book has been updated in 2010 and is, in fact, dedicated to Ray Anderson. Hawken writes about human-caused environmental destruction in general (updated now with current thinking on climate change) and talks about the need for a \u201crestorative economy\u201d that goes beyond merely stopping the destruction to actually restoring what we have already destroyed. Hawken, like Naomi Klein in her monumental work This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate, clearly establishes the links among corporate capitalism, income inequality, and climate change. There are many innovative, \u201coutside the box\u201d ideas in The Ecology of Commerce that could help us, if only they were achievable in our poisoned political and economic atmosphere."}, {"userName": "Kelcie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9251522-kelcie", "userReview": "This book was mighty depressing... I contemplated not reading it because of how old it is.. But the fact it was written in 1993 made it even more relevant. Hawken tries to remain optimistic in the face of the daunting statistics concerning climate change, pollution, over population and the willingness (or lack thereof) of the corporate world to take responsibility for their actions against out population and the planet we call home. His manifesto of sustainability is inspiring yet heartbreaking. This book could have changed the world.. The best a reader can do is take all of this book to heart and change their own ways to make less of an impact but the driving point of this book is the need for CORPORATE responsibility, initiative and change which was the most disheartening part since our situation in that respect has only worsened exponentially since this book was written."}, {"userName": "Marjorie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/866028-marjorie", "userReview": "If it weren't for the overly businesslike writing style of this book, I would have probably really enjoyed it. I don't consider myself a \"dummy\" at all, but I think I would have prefered a \"...for dummies\" version of this particular book. The author makes some good points about how business & society in general needs to make more fundamental changes in order to right the environmental situation we face.... & that minor efforts (recycling, hybrid cars, etc) are not sufficient to produce real long term solutions. However good these points are, it was a painful process wading through the overly wordy book to get the main points out of it. I felt like a lot of it could have been omitted or streamlined without losing the focus- sometimes less is more."}, {"userName": "NK", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/533391-nk", "userReview": "This was a pretty decent book to read at the request of my boyfriend who's going to school for his Sustainability degree from Harvard. I would like to just say to have a dictionary handy, there are words that get used that are not in normal vocabulary or at least mine which happened more often than not. It does go through alot of different things, not just global warming as you know it. There are aspects of this that really make you think about the world & the impact we really have on it.
