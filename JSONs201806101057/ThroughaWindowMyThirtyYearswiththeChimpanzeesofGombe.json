Through a Window is the history of a family. It spans 30 years in a chimpanzee community inhabiting the Gombe wilderness of Tanzania. With Jane Goodall as our guide, we are introduced to a group of individuals with personalities and life stories as distinctive as those of any human. There's Gilka, an outgoing and playful youngster who grows up into an unlucky, crippled outcast. There's Jomeo, physically imposing but uninterested in using that strength to climb the social ladder. There's Flo, the skillful matriarch whose influence can be seen in her descendants long after she leaves the world. Through the interactions of these and many other members of the Gombe tribe, we can observe inklings of practices that are sometimes regarded as human inventions, including war, monogamy, and adoption. On the subject of humans, the beginning and end of the book address the rocky relationship between our species and the chimpanzees, from the scientific community's early pushback against the idea of chimps having emotions, to ongoing abuse of these animals for the sake of research and entertainment. As devastating as these issues are, Goodall also gives voice to the many people working to preserve habitats for chimps in the wild, as well as those making existence more bearable for chimps in captivity. Goodall's writing is sharp and descriptive, and I admire her ability to integrate and transition between the different topics covered in this book. She immerses us in the beauty, the horror, and the mystery of the lives of our closest living relatives."}, {"userName": "Jacqui", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2105211-jacqui", "userReview": "I have read every book that Jane Goodall wrote. She has an easy-going writing style that shares scientific principals easily with the layman. Probably because when she started, she was little more than a novice, going from secretarial school to the Gombe to study chimpanzees. She stayed there on and off for thirty years. This book, Through a Window (Houghton Mifflin 1990) shares her thoughts and conclusions on what she learned from that stretch of time with the chimpanzees.The book reads like an anecdotal history of a town, inhabited by chimpanzees, but no less vibrant than any human town you might visit. Families mingle, struggle for survival, fight for loedership. Children mate and have babies. Parenting styles differ, which dramatically affects the future of the youngsters. A war between factions breaks out and residents take sides. There is death and rebirth, pain and sorrow, and rebirth again.This book could be considered about animal behaviro, but I challenge you to read it--without knowing it deals with chimps--and not recognize your neighbors, relatives, acquaintances, colleagues in the caste. You'll find the emotions you'd experience in friends and the actions you'd expect from those you work with. You'll think it's the history of a small town.And it is, but a town of primates.The chapter titles tell you what you're in for: Mothers and daughters Figan's rise Power Change Sex War Sons and Mothers Love Bridging the GapSound familiar? By the time I finished this book, after reading Goodall's others, I never looked at chimpanzees or any of the great apes the same. Their emotions, actions, thoughts, desires are too close to human to be relegated to some 'animal' that we can't understand. I'd recommend this for all those interested in studying our humanity."}, {"userName": "LibraryCin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin", "userReview": "4.5 starsThis was originally written in 1990, 30 years after Jane Goodall went to Gombe National Park in Tanzania to study chimpanzees My edition was published in 2010, so there is even extra info with a preface and an afterword written by Jane in 2009. This continues/updates her first book on the chimps of Gombe, In the Shadow of Man. I read In the Shadow of Man a number of years ago, but I loved revisiting the same chimps and their offspring, and following them later in the their lives! Jane is also an adamant activist/conservationist, so at the end of the book, after all the extra chimp information and updates (which really is the bulk of the book), she writes a little bit about human-raised chimps, chimps used in experiments, chimps losing their habitat, etc. There are a number of photos of the chimps included, as well. Overall, I really really enjoyed reading this!"}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10579265-paul", "userReview": "I was with my family at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) over the recent Christmas break and happened to see a display based on Jane Goodall\u2019s work with the chimpanzees of Gombe on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in East Africa. I\u2019d always enjoyed primate exhibits at zoos, and the OMSI exhibit encouraged me to do some further reading.Through a Window is Goodall\u2019s autobiographical retrospective on her facinating career in Gombe. The stories of the chimpanzees that form the core of this book read more like sociology than biology. Their personalities and habits are wonderfully told. Altruism, murder, war, affection, ambition, depression, kindness, anger\u2014the chimpanzees exhibit all these behaviors and more.Goodall presents a variety of approaches in order to illustrate the breadth of chimp personality and society. Some chapters focus on specific behaviors: \u201cPower,\u201d \u201cSex,\u201d \u201cWar.\u201d Other chapters provide biographical sketches of individuals. Two chapters outline the relationships between \u201cMothers and Daughters\u201d on the one hand and \u201cSons and Mothers\u201d on the other. There\u2019s also a very interesting chapter on the interactions between baboons and chimpanzees: competitors for food, childhood playmates, and occasionally sex partners.It is this sophistication of chimpanzee society that Goodall believes places a heavy moral burden on humans. The contrast between these primates in their natural communities and others in man-made prisons could not be more stark. Looking back on the individual chimps she has known, Goodall attests that \u201cmy affection for them is close to love. But it is a love for beings who are essentially wild and free.\u201d Keeping chimpanzees alive\u2014as pets, zoo exhibits, or labratory subjects\u2014is not the same as letting them live. As with humans, chimpanzee personalities and society are far more intricate than the sum of their biological raw material."}, {"userName": "Joann", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5937823-joann", "userReview": "I have admired Jane Goodall ever since seeing \"Miss Goodall and the Wild Chimpanzees\" on TV when I was quite young. This book didn't disappoint. It is primarily a chronicle of the first thirty years of the work observing chimpanzee behavior at the Gombe reserve on the shore of Lake Tanganyika. There is a shorter summary at the end which discusses the intervening years with updates on the inhabitants of the reserve.I have to agree with other reviews that I have read that say this book reads more like a novel as it, indeed, provides a window to the reader on a fascinating and complex society. A social hierarchy that demonstrates how similar we humans are to the chimpanzee with everything from nurture to jealousy to power, cooperation, striving for status within the community, finding the best mates, and, yes, brutal violence and genocide. Ms Goodall's writing style is quite approachable and those who are afraid this might read like a Ph.D. thesis have nothing to fear. Ms. Goodall takes us into this world as a keen observer and we come to know and care about the lives and welfare of these families of chimps while we cannot help but see how many of their traits - both good and bad - that we share."}, {"userName": "Claire Gillaspy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34875238-claire-gillaspy", "userReview": "I would recommend this book to others if they are interested in Jane Goodall and her work or just animals behavior in general. I read this book for a National History Day project and it was very helpful in giving me a look into Goodall's work in the forests of Gombe. This book unlike many non-fiction books I have read for this project, it gives not only interesting facts about chimps in general and their remarkable relation to humans, but also great stories of their lives in the wild. You start to feel so close to some of the chimpanzees and I wish I knew how they were doing today. Goodall is a wonderful author whose tales of Africa leave you on the edge of your seat while making you wonder about the world around you. I enjoyed the conclusion of the book, as well as the updates she gave about some of the chimpanzees years later.

Jane Goodall writes about the chimpanzees she knew so well with insight and empathy. Some of the stories told are quite horrifying, including territorial wars and infanticide. Some attempts are made at the end of the book to compare us to them. That the study of chimpanzees would help us understand ourselves. However, it is worth considering how much difference in behavior there is betweeen the aggressive chimpanzees and their closest relatives, the peaceful bonobos. Behavior doesn't fossilize. The one key characteristic between us and our ancestors since the line split from that of the other great apes, is the lack of fangs. This might indicate that cooperation rather than conflict is a key characteristic of early humans. This aside, this is a beautifully written and fascinating book about our closest relatives in the animal kingdom."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40435270-kathryn", "userReview": "I don't think I had a full appreciation for chimpanzees until reading this book. Since Dr. Goodall organized most of the chapters by themes or focusing on individual animals it was a little hard to keep things straight. The different power struggles, personalities, and family dynamics were fascinating but I had to basically give up on remembering exactly how the different stories fit together in the timeline. I like the fact that she talks about the good, the bad, and the ugly versus painting an idealized picture of chimpanzee life. (For example, at several points some female chimps take it upon themselves to steal and murder the infants of any other chimps in the community.) The final several chapters did an excellent job of tying things together and explaining how these specific anecdotes provided greater insights not only for chimpanzees, but also humans. I don't think Dr. Goodall is a particularly good writer. There were lots of clunky sentences and descriptions that felt cliche. Despite those limitations she does a good job of maintaining an approachable tone and keeping things accessible to a broad audience. While she generally seemed to keep her ego in check, there was one part where she said that in the mythology of the Gombe chimpanzees they \"would naturally have made me their patron saint\". Given her clear dedication to chimpanzee wellbeing and preservation I'll let it slide, but it definitely seemed a little grandiose.In summary, chimpanzees are cool and I'm glad I learned more about them. This book inspired me to make a small donation to the Jane Goodall Institute."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8347159-laura", "userReview": "I never thought I would enjoy a book about observing chimpanzees in the wild so much.

Because I\u2019ve always kind of looked up to Jane Goodall, I decided to pick up one of her books and this ended up being the one I chose.I\u2019ll start off by saying that whether you know nothing or know a lot about chimps, this book will definitely have something for you to learn and/or enjoy. I\u2019ve taken several biological anthropology and primatology courses and so I know quite a bit about chimpanzees, but this book was still very interesting to me. There were still things discussed in the book that I hadn\u2019t really known much about and it was nice to get to learn about them.Goodall has this great way of writing about the chimps she studied that really makes them so human. Of course, chimpanzees are very human-like in a lot of ways. But Goodall really brings them to life as she talks about them and the ups-and-downs of their lives. It makes the book a lot more interesting to read because it\u2019s less a presentation of various facts and more of a narrative story of the lives of several chimpanzees.Another thing that I really liked was that Goodall takes the last few chapters of the book to discuss what we can learn about humans by studying chimpanzees as well as many of the horrors chimpanzees face because of humans. She talks about the illegal pet trade, for example, and how cruel it is to the primates who are captured or killed because of it. She also discusses the cruelty of research labs and offers some suggestions on how to make those facilities better for the chimps living there. I know Jane Goodall now spends a lot of time doing conservation work, so it was nice to see that incorporated into the book, especially since I know a lot of people don\u2019t think about how harmful things like the primate pet trade can be.Through a Window was a really great book that made learning about chimpanzees really enjoyable. I think you\u2019ll really enjoy reading this regardless of whether you know a lot about chimps already or are looking to be introduced to our closest living relatives.

I thought that I would like it, but I didn't think I would be so fascinated by her studies, almost like I was seeing the chimpanzees in the wild myself.I also never thought I would be able to relate to these real life \"characters.\" I found my own characteristics in a few of the chimpanzees she writes about. I also like that she doesn't come across as pure scientist, but also writes with wisdom and love. \"There are many windows through which we can look out into the world, searching for meaning. There are those opened up by science, their panes polished by a succession of brilliant, penetrating minds. Through these we can see ever further, ever more clearly, into areas that once lay beyond human knowledge. Gazing through such a window I have, over the years, learned much about chimpanzee behaviour and their place in the nature of things. And this, in turn, has helped us to understand a little better some aspects of human behaviour, our own place in nature.But there are other windows; windows that have been unshuttered by logic of philosophers; windows through which the mystics seek their visions of the truth; windows from which the leaders of the great religions have peered as they searched for purpose not only in the wondrous beauty of the world, but also in its darkness and ugliness. Most of us, when we ponder on the mystery of our existence, peer through but one of these windows onto the world. And even that one is often misted over by the breath of our finite humanity. We clear a tiny peephole and stare through. No wonder we are confused by the tiny fraction of a whole that we see.

As I started the journey into Jane Goodall's description of her time spent with the chimpanzees in East Africa, right away I would have been intimidated. She's starting off into the forest alone, with some raisons for lunch, to observe the chimp families. To carry this on year after year, record meaningful data, learn to recognize and name them (unique to her study, as opposed to giving them a number), and then write about it in a way people, other than scientists or biologists, can appreciate it. Not to mention the heartache of watching them through times of sickness, cannibalism, and the fight for dominance. I suppose, as with humans, those times are balanced by her observations of the affectionate family bonds. How brave she was to persevere until she was accepted within their territory but at times to have been pushed or stomped on. She did have students in camp who joined the study, venturing out by twos, coming back to report at the end of the day. Of course probably most everyone has heard about the discovery that the chimpanzees learned to use a stick as a tool to obtain termites from a nest.

Goodall bookends her story well, starting off with the reactions of the scientific community towards her in the beginning of her career and ending with a conclusive summary of the degrees of difference between humans and chimpanzees, as well as the horrors that some of these animals face in the name of scientific research.

It reads like a novel, but it is one of the most important scientific works ever published. The community is Gombe, on the shores of Lake Tangganyika, where the principal residents are chimpanzees and one extraordinary woman who is their student, protector, and historian. In her classic In the Shadow of Man, Jane Goodall wrote of her first ten years at Gombe. In Through a Window she brings the story up to the present, painting a much more complete and vivid portrait of our closest relative. We see the community split in two and a brutal war break out. We watch young Figan's relentless rise to power and old Mike's crushing defeat. We learn how one mother rears her children to succeed and another dooms them to failure. We witness horrifying murders, touching moments of affection, joyous births, and wrenching deaths. In short, we see every emotion known to humans stripped to its essence. In the mirror of chimpanzee life, we see ourselves reflected.
