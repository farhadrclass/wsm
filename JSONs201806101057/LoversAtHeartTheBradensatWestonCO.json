However, Max is heartbroken when the next day Treat spurns her.\u00a0 Of course, what Treat reacts to is seeing Max in the company of a co-worker in the early morning hours and she is wearing the same clothes from the night before which leads to Treat's own jealousy and hurt feelings. When Max and Treat meet again unexpectedly in Treat's hometown of Weston, Colorado, it's their opportunity to explore their second chance. But when the hurt feelings of their first meeting make this second opportunity at a union difficult, Treat and Max must learn that they must be willing to get hurt again if they really want to find love. Can their be a HEA under the circumstances?BJ Harrison returns to narrate this debut book in the spin-off series of The Bradens. Having already gotten used to Mr. Harrison's melodic voice, I was able to quickly re-transition back into the lives of these characters. I also as a general matter enjoy his voice. Mr. Harrison has a soothing voice that sounds like a therapist's voice. This voice worked well to highlight Treat's good qualities and also helped to bring to life Max's and Treat's struggles with their own feelings as they try and find love.All in all, the focus of this book is on the struggles that people must overcome to finally find true happiness and love. If you enjoy books with this as the central theme, and enjoy a full cast in your romances with lots of secondary characters that give the book the feeling of a family drama, then Lovers at Heart is sure to hit the right spot.Source: Review copy provided for review purposes."}, {"userName": "Whispers From", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17370565-whispers-from", "userReview": "FairI almost didn't finish reading this. I hate giving bad reviews but this was just disappointing. I have never read a book where a man cried so much, I know we all want sensitive men but he cried all the time. I can't understand how you can miss someone you've known a few days. Max needed to put on her big girl panties and grow up.Max is a festival coordinator who meets Treat at her bosses wedding 6 months before. He sees her with the same clothes on as the night before and sends her a dirty look. She takes off and doesn't see him until she has a festival near his father's ranch. Treat, after not seeing her in months, decides he loves her & can't live without her. More misunderstandings, more crying from both, & running from each other before they \"face their demons\" & get together. I am sorry but this story just wasn't that good. Others might like it but not me."}, {"userName": "Angie Elle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8572258-angie-elle", "userReview": "***This book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.***This was my first book from Melissa Foster, but it certainly won\u2019t be my last!I really enjoyed the small town feel this book had, especially the portion that took place in New England. The way they fit into their surroundings always says something to me about the characters, and I love that Treat new \u2018the locals\u2019 so well, and that Max was quick to make friends.Treat\u2019s family was a highlight in this book for me. I loved his dedication to them and his desire to make them proud. His character was such a stand-up guy; when he realized he was in love with Max, he took personal responsibility for her happiness, and I loved that about him. He learned from his mistake the first time around\u2013he wasn\u2019t going to let her get away again, and he wasn\u2019t going to waste a moment in telling her how he felt. His fears were so founded, and I loved that he was willing to push past them so he could move on with Max.Max was a \u2018tougher nut to crack\u2019 for me. She had a lot of issues, and while I love that she was finally able to semi-conquer them and admit she wanted to be with Treat, I\u2019m not sure she ever took responsibility for them. I think this fits with her character, though. Max was a bit neurotic, and Treat\u2019s stability is going to be a constant source of strength for her throughout their lives. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons Treat and Max work so well together\u2013Treat loves being a rock for the people around him.Aside from Treat\u2019s family, I really liked Chaz and Kaylie. Kaylie brought so much life to every scene she was in! She was such a fun character to read.Also, the steam factor in this book was freaking hot! Treat and Max were definitely well matched in the bedroom!I recommend this book if you are looking for a story with a small-town feel where the hero works to get his gal!"}, {"userName": "Jenny Miller", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14120955-jenny-miller", "userReview": "I had a hard time finishing this book to be honest. First of all, it says it's book 1 in the series. There has to be a prequel, or another series that led into this book, because I just felt like I missed a big part of their story (and there were hints of past stories for other characters, too). Treat was kind of unbelievable. Ok, most of the guys in romance novels are, lol, but he was just over-the-top sappy. I just had a hard time buying into his feelings (honestly I didn't connect with his character at all). I also felt the book dragged onand onand on.I'm torn because the next book actually sounds more interesting, but if it's more of the same I'm afraid I'll be very disappointed.edited to add: My kindle says this is book 1. The short description in my list of books on goodreads says this is book 1 in the Bradens series, but I also now see this is book 4 in the 'love in bloom' series. i wish this was clearer from the get-go - my expectations would have been a little different going in. bottom line, though, is it just didn't work for me."}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5401033-marlene", "userReview": "Treat knew that he had to get away from Nassau for a bit.

He buys resorts all over the world, knows his way with women but none of them managed to get under his skin like Max Armstrong.A few misunderstood words made her turn away and hide from him. Now he's obsessed with her and highly confused as not one woman made him work so hard for her affections.Max is a successful woman with a job that makes her satisfied and fullfilled.She stays away from any kind of relationships and can be seen as withdrawn to the onlookers.Yet she is very independent, cautious and hard headed.That's why the fact that the one and only man that Max cannot keep out of her head is the arogant bastard Treat, keeps her on constant alert. The chemistry between the characters is sizzling hot yet the both of them have trust issues and the tendency to jump to conclusions that threaten to overpower the shaky ground of their relationship.Overall Lovers at Heart is a well written story that makes the readers look for and want more of this series."}, {"userName": "Carrie Lahain", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18181461-carrie-lahain", "userReview": "Max Armstrong is probably my favorite character from Melissa Foster's LOVE IN BLOOM series of romance novels. She's a type-A organizing maniac whose frenetic self-sufficiency masks a true vulnerability. In LOVEERS AT HEART, Max comes face to face with her biggest nightmare--a man who makes her want to curl up in his arms and be taken care of. Max met Treat Braden in SISTERS IN WHITE when she organized her boss' double wedding. Treat, a cousin to the other groom, owns the resort where the event took place. The instant attraction between Max and Treat short circuited due to a misunderstanding, and both of them have spent the past six months trying to forget the other. But Treat's family is from Colorado, not far from where Max lives and works, so the inevitable happens.On one hand, I enjoyed the tension created as Max and Treat bounce between searching each other out and running away. Both characters have a rich back story, which makes their actions believable most of the time. The POV alternates between Treat and Max. Overall this works fine. Treat is a big (BIG) alpha-male. I love that Foster peels away layers of responsibility and grief suffocating him and gets to the human being inside. At times, though, he's gets a little too Mr. Sensitive. The words that come out of his mouth don't quite convince, rather it's the author speaking her vision of a sensitive man. Max, too, loses her edge at times, but then we learn about the truly horrific event underlying her fear and her over-the-top emotional swings snap right into place. I did question the number of missed or ignored cell phone calls. I noticed this back in SISTERS IN BLOOM, and it irritated me then as well. It's not just the actual ignoring/missing of the calls. But all the agonizing (remember, we've got TWO points of view) over whether or not the calls should be/are being ignored or missed. Not that I would outlaw cellphones from romance novels. Near the end of the book, Max loses track of her cellphone and it creates an amazing amount of tension for the reader. Picture this: two in the morning and I'm sitting on the sofa yelling at my Kindle... \"Where's her F----N phone!\" The dogs start barking. It's bedlam. THAT is how an author makes use of modern technology! Taken as a whole, LOVERS AT HEART is a great read. It's full of well-drawn characters, and Foster does an amazing job with the scenes at Cape Cod and the Braden ranch. I finished the book in love with the Braden brothers. There are five of them, by the way. Plus a sister. Each is getting a book. That's going to make for plenty of late-night Kindle binges."}, {"userName": "LaFleurBleue", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8956777-lafleurbleue", "userReview": "[ the stupid heroine left the hero in the middle of the night to flee home all across the country to avoid discussing his changing his life for her, which she feared he might come to regret some day  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5401033-marlene", "userReview": "Treat knew that he had to get away from Nassau for a bit.

I would have given it a 4.5-star if the fist half of the book had not moved too slowly for my taste, with more small details that really didn't add much to the story.Max is a very good, sweet girl who has been left emotionally damaged by a romantic relationship in her last year of college. It continues to haunt her, making relationships with the opposite sex difficult and trust...nonexistent. Meanwhile she meets a gorgeous man who mistakenly thinks she is somewhat of a loose woman. She runs into him six months after their initial meeting and she is not happy to see him. His disgust with her hurt her deeply. We as readers know that things are not always as they seem.Treat is a real treat. Gorgeous and sexy, he can have any woman he wants and does but short term only. He has sworn to himself that he will never fall in love. He lost his mother when he was eleven and although the whole family was devastated, he does not ever want to go through the loss and misery his father went through after the loss. Then...there was a wedding held at one of his resorts and the event planner for this affair is a beautiful young woman named Max. He is instantly drawn to her but fails to ask her out. When he sees her a day or so after meeting her he realizes her rumpled clothes are what she had been wearing the night before...immediately assuming she spent the night with one of his employees that he had seen her talking to. He reacts terrible and gives her a look that says exactly what kind of woman he thinks she is. When he goes home to visit his family six months later, he is beyond shocked when he runs in to her as she tries her best to avoid him.The sparks fly in a major way.I highly recommend this book.

This book can be read as a standalone novel but I feel its best enjoyed as part of the series as to best understand all of the characters as they appear in the book. Treat Braden is a hot and sexy man who is also very rich. He buys resorts all over the world. Treat has had woman over the years but none of them managed to get under his skin like Max Armstrong. He has been obsessed with her since his misunderstanding that made her turn away from him. It\u2019s easy to see that Treat is not used to working so hard with woman especially one so independent like Max. Max has a successful career that keeps her comfortable and a great boss. She is independent to the point that it\u2019s hard for her to comprise at times. She stays away from relationships for reasons she keeps to herself and does not want all her friends around her to know. There is one man that Max cannot keep out of her head and its Treat. She is at a loss as to how to deal with him. The chemistry between Treat and Max is blistering hot. If they could only manage to talk to each other rather than jump to conclusions with each other than they would have not had such a bumpy road as they fell in love with each other. It was easy to see that they were perfect for each other. Overall, this was a magnificent story. I found this book very well written. I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book.

It is the first book in the series that follows the Braden family exclusively but there is back story that isn't very clearly revealed that takes up a lot of space and time in the very beginning of the book. I tried to find the book that would give me the information I wanted only to find that there was not one but THREE books that preceded this onea and which one of those three was the proper one I was never able to figure out. Despite this huge irritation I pushed through hoping the claims of this being a stand alone book would hold true. It managed, but barely, in my opinion. Once you get past all the crap you don't know about you do have a pretty enjoyable set of characters. Sadly, I was too jaded from my earlier difficulties to really care. It was nice how real and approachable the family was. I thought the way that Treat was portrayed was nice. Max was kind of a flake. She's too smart to be that stupid about relationships just because one went so horribly wrong. All in all I'm glad I was stubborn enough to finish but all the added and unnecessary drama over what happened and how these people are linked put me off the series all together. I won't continue with any later books. I will not read any of the preceding books. To be honest I don't think I will read anything else by this author just out of spite for what I consider false advertising. FYI to the author. You might want to work on getting this clarified on Amazon and on Good reads since neither of them had very helpful information about the supposed book 1 fiasco."}, {"userName": "Arielle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23025740-arielle", "userReview": "If you want to read a book that is completely ridiculous, I\u2019d suggest this one. The characters are underdeveloped and they make unfounded decisions solely for the purpose of another 100 pages. If this had been a novella, I may have said it was \u201cOK\u201d. Unfortunately, it just kept going and going. So to spare everyone their time, here\u2019s a quick summary: she hates him, he loves her, they\u2019re together, now she\u2019s crying, etc. That\u2019s really all you need to know, because anyone wondering if there\u2019s a happy ending must have never read a romance novel before.Admittedly, I have only read a few romance novels, but I\u2019m already overwhelmed by the use of stereotypes. It seems that all women, according to the romance universe, are innocent. It\u2019s likely that they\u2019ve only slept with a two or three people, and the men, of course have all been past playboys just waiting to be tamed. It is seriously exhausting to read a book so far behind and so caught up in gender stereotypes.The language in this book was also sub-par, most notably the use of the word \u201csweetness\u201d. I hope I never ever see the word \"sweetness\" again in my life, and I apologize to everyone for posting it here.Overall, this book confirms every stereotype about romance novels, and I am thoroughly embarrassed that I\u2019ve read it. I can\u2019t even begin to explain the way I felt when I found out that this work of art was written by a bestselling author.

I lost control of my emotions while reading the book. Melissa is such an amazing romance writer. Her sex scenes get your body fighting to have sex, especially the naughty area. It also leaves you imagining the characters having sex, and you wish it\u2019s happening to you.I laughed out my eyes at a scene where Treat slid his groin into Max, forgotten that he had no condom on simply because he was lost in the romance sensation. Few seconds after he had drove gently, and slowly into Max, he remembered that he had no condom on. \u2018Shit!\u2019 he had shouted. At once, he ran upstairs naked, taking two steps at a time in order to get the condom. The scene was so funny. Just imagine how Treat would be running on the stairs with his erection dangling from side to side.One advice for readers who're intending to read this book, please do not read the book without your partner by your side, else you might hurt your mood, and Melissa will not be held responsible for it. I love the characters, they are transparent, and the writer did enough to dig into each characters.

It\u2019s a little confusing however I like it because you still get some of the Snow sisters however now you get more of Blake\u2019s cousins the Braden\u2019s. A family of six, 5 boys and one girl or should I say 5 men and 1 women? Either way they are all very beautiful, really rich and very successful.In book 3 you met Treat, Blake\u2019s oldest cousin, Treat, Treat owns dozens of resorts all around the world and is super rich. He and Max seemed to have had a \u201cconnection\u201d when they first met but then something happened and she would avoid him and kept calling him arrogant throughout the rest of the book. You really didn\u2019t get the whole story behind what the something was though.This book takes place 6 months later and Treat still can\u2019t get Max out of his mind so he decides that he\u2019s going to go to his family home for some much needed time off. His family home however is a large ranch in Colorado which isn\u2019t very far from where Max lives and works. He just happens to go home the weekend of the Film Festival in which Max plays a huge part in making sure that everything runs smoothly. I\u2019ve been a fan of Max since the beginning of the series. She\u2019s always been a strong person that knew what she needed to do to get things done and to get them done efficiently. You find out in this book that she didn\u2019t get to that point without a great deal of hardship and struggle. You of course find out why she always keeps her work life and her private life separate as well as why she never seems to have a boyfriend or go on dates.Treat has his own set of demons that he has yet to concur. He was the oldest of six and only 11 years old when his mother passed away. He was one that all of his younger siblings came running to when they needed something. When he graduated high school and left for college, he never looked back. Sure he would go home when they needed him but he was always looking towards the next big resort and traveling to far off places. He never thought of settling down until he met Max. So far I believe that this was my favorite one in the series. While there was still drama in this book it wasn\u2019t over the top as it was the other books. I will also say that I was once again a fan of Kaylie in this book. She and Max have become even closer friends and she was always there dropping whatever she was doing when Max needed her.While this is technically book 4, it can be read as stand-alone book with the way that it is written. Book 5 is already out and is called Destined to Love which show cases Rex, the 2nd oldest Braden man as well a long time family feud between the Braden\u2019s and the ranch next door.

I love that you could have started with this one and then gone back and gotten some more back story on the Snow Sisters from the other three books, if you were dying to read this one. The Snow sisters are still involved in this novel, but the novel focuses mainly on the Bradens. The Bradens are Blake\u2019s cousins. They are a family of six that include five men and just one woman. I found myself jealous because they were all very rich and it seemed like they could do no wrong with claiming success.You were introduced to one of the Bradens, Treat, in Book # 3. He is the oldest of Blake\u2019s cousins and he owns a lot of resorts. One of them was used in Book #3 for both Snow sisters to stay in on their wedding trip. I was so happy when I noticed the connection that was brewing between Max and Treat. Max is more of a timid character and she was not wanting anything to do with Treat. It was so obvious to the reader that they just needed to get together and figure things out but she thought that he was nothing more than arrogant. Book #4 surrounds Treat taking some time to think and \u201ctry\u201d to get Max out of his head, which he is not very successful with at all. When he decides that he needs to clear his head and go home, he has no idea that his home is very close to where Max lives and works herself. It is so ironic that the weekend he decides to go clear his mind of her that she is there making sure that everything is up to par with the Film Festival.You find out what really makes Max tick the way that she does in this book, and that was thrilling to me since I had always thought of her as a strong female role in the other books. You find out that not everything was icecream and cakes for her when she was younger and that she has had to struggle to make herself into the woman that she is today. The mystery as to why she never talks about her personal life and never seems to have a relationship is also let out of the bag in this novel. No spoilers here though! Treat has some things of his own that he has had to deal with throughout his life. He was not ever the relationship type of person because of having to take care of his siblings after their mother passed when he was eleven. Now he has met Max and his thoughts have completely changed.I am already ready to be reading Book #5, Destined For Love.

All opinions are strictly my own.We first met Max Armstong in the Love In Bloom series. She is the assistant to Chaz, Kaylie Snow\u2019s husband. She seemed very bookish and reserved, independent and possibly even a workaholic. She was just all no nonsense and extremely organized. She didn\u2019t really wear make-up and kept her hair pulled up in a pony tail. No one knew if she had ever even had a boyfriend.In Lovers At Heart, Max and Treat are very passionate. We see that Max can let herself have fun and cut loose. She does have a sensual and seductive side. But we also see that she keeps her heart shielded and is very skittish when it comes to love, \u00a0because of her past, which was nothing at all what I thought it would be. She had a VERY traumatic experience that left her not willing to fully trust Treat\u2019s kindness.Even though Max and Treat\u2019s story goes back and forth a lot, I still like the way they are written. I like that we see someone who is truly damaged, trying to fix themselves. I like that even though there is a painful past and major trust issues, we still get to see Max wanting to follow her heart. And we see Treat go through a major roller-coaster with his emotions and Max\u2019s as well.Be prepared for another hot and heavy romance novel filled with love scenes that\u2019ll make you blush. Unlike movies with dozens of sex scenes, there really is a story-line here! So even if mature content isn't your cup of tea, I still think you\u2019ll love Lovers At Heart. While this is a stand alone book, I would suggest reading the Love In Bloom series to catch up on Max\u2019s history a bit before reading it."}, {"userName": "Michelle Garrett", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8086409-michelle-garrett", "userReview": "Melissa Foster creates such realistic and relate-able characters that you cannot help but love them. Here stories and characters remind me of the characters in my favorite soap opera from years ago. They become a part of your life \u2013 even after the credits end for the very last time.The Love in Bloom Series is one of the best series I have read in quite some time. The situations and turn of events keep you engrossed, entertained and wanting more.We got to know Max Armstrong in Sisters In Love and now it\u2019s her turn for a chance at love! But, of course, a good romance novel becomes a great novel when there are all kinds of emotional drama and baggage involved. Ms. Foster even turned up the steam a little more in this novel, it seems, but the chemistry between the two main characters in this book definitely deserve it.Both characters, for their individual reasons, have trust issues to get past and that hinder their quest for love and happiness. It is refreshing to see them identify those issues and take measures (although in roundabout ways at times) to tackle them.Even though this is part of a series, you can read this as a standalone book and still enjoy it\u2026but WHY would you want to do that!"}, {"userName": "Maddux", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5026570-maddux", "userReview": "This was definitely better than The Snow Sisters. More enjoyable.I know that Treat and Max's story began in one of the previous Snow Sisters books. I didn't read the 2nd and 3rd of that series, because I couldn't get through the 2nd (insert \"blegh face\") book. I suppose the past meet up with Max and Treat is explained sufficiently in Lovers At Heart, but I did feel like I missed out on something.Then I realized that the big hiccup was a dirty look from Treat in the 3rd Snow Sister book? This guy gave the girl a dirty look, a look that said \"You're nothing but a dirty hoor\" because he saw her in the hallway of his resort the next day in the same clothes she was wearing the night before.This girl took that look to heart and it messed with her. Because these two were obviously attracted to one other. But nothing else was said. There was no relationship yet.So all that kind of felt out of proportion. Then we learn about some terrible things that happened to Max when she was in college. And I really got problems with how that guy was handled in this book. Yeeesh. Guy sexually assaulted at least 2 women. Conclusion? He's a schizo.

Max is the organizing guru with more than a dash of neuroses and ocd, and while helpful with her planning work, is often detrimental to her personal life. She\u2019s clever, driven, outwardly self-confident and wholly in charge of her life. Treat owns several resorts, is always bouncing about and around, and he\u2019s got a serious case of wedding hangover after a memorable, if not his best, moment at the wedding. Together \u2013 these two get another chance to make things right DESPITE their both having serious reservations and issues. Treat is very metrosexual \u2013 he\u2019s a solidly good guy who I seriously hoped would find some emotional control. His own dedication to his family and to seeing them happy and settled, often to the detriment of his own forward progress and growth wasn\u2019t over the top, until you add in his bone-deep fear of finding that \u201clove\u201d and then losing it. There\u2019s plenty of growth that needs to happen for Treat, and while I like characters that are in touch with their emotions, there was a bit of \u201cnot again\u2019 with each new emotional revelation for him. On the other hand, Max is almost closed off from her inner voices, until or unless she encounters someone who reminds her of all the bad moments with her ex. Unwilling to stand for any critical judgments from any man, she just shuts down and pushes people away from her, with an almost angry overtone. We do see that her self-confidence from her work, which she does near perfectly, isn\u2019t always translating over, and that makes her very defensive. Oh \u2013 and when she\u2019s angry or feeling pressured by anything BUT work, she\u2019s a horrible listener, and refuses to ask questions or hear explanations. So there was a TON of back and forth with these two. And, I kind of have to give Treat kudos for sticking in there, making it clear that he wanted her and her alone, and that he wouldn\u2019t stop pursuing her. In the abstract, for a story, it\u2019s pretty damn romantic\u2026although I can see how it could dance over the edge to stalker if their connection wasn\u2019t so palpable and obvious to everyone else. Narration is again provided by B, J, Harrison, who again does a lovely job in presenting characters, story and emotional layers without overworking the emotion or getting in the way of the story as it unfolded. But it is less a critique of performance than musing over the \u2018rightness\u2019 of this narrator for this book. I would have liked a dual narrator team for this title, while Harrison does a wonderful job in separating and distinctly presenting both male and female voices, I would have appreciated the addition of a female to narrate the women\u2019s parts. There was just a little something not quite fitting with the characters as I envisioned them \u2013 and having read and listened to this story (I own the title) there was a piece missing, some youthful edge, that would have added to the performance here.

I\u2019m so glad I read another Melissa Foster book! I will continue to read her books since this is the 2nd one I have read and I enjoyed it. Max Armstrong has a successful career and a comfortable life. She\u2019s never needed a man but at her boss\u2019s wedding in Nassau, Treat Braden caught her attention. During one of their brief encounters Treat caused a surge of emotions that was reminiscent of her painful past. Max will do anything to avoid reliving her painful past, including forgoing desire for Treat.Treat Braden is a six foot six handsome and wealthy resort owner. When Max Armstrong walked into his life, she sparked an unfamiliar desire in him for more than a one-night stand. But one misunderstanding caused her to turn away, and now, after six months of longing for the one woman he cannot have, he's going home to Colorado to try to forget her all together.When a chance encounter turns into a night of intense passion, Treat realizes that the mistake he made six months earlier may cause him to lose Max completely. At first I could not figure out why Max was so upset by something that seemed fairly minor but once I found out exactly what happened in her past, I completely understood.

She\u2019s written another great book on relationships including sibling relationships full of love, regrets, fears, and rivalry, and a delightful love story full of misunderstandings, learning to trust, and steamy love scenes.If you\u2019ve read the previous books in the Love of Bloom series you will recognize Treat Braden (Blake\u2019s cousin) and Max (Chaz\u2019s assistant). You will find yourself rooting for them. They both have issues they need to deal with before they can find themselves able to commit to a relationship. Melissa Foster has made this true to life and makes you feel like you are really there.I\u2019ve always found it funny how people interpret the same event in different ways, even in families. Treat and his siblings each have their own perspectives of events when their mother passes away. They all have their own issues whether it be anger, insecurity, regret, etc. More than 20 years after Treat\u2019s mother passes away, he is ready and willing to confide his insecurities and regrets to the rest of his family. The family dynamics that Melissa Foster portrays are so true to life that you truly feel like you are a fly on the wall watching the family.While this is part of a series, it can be read as a stand alone book. This is the first book in the series about the Bradens. So, you are not missing much. Basically all of the characters are new except for Blake and Max. However, there was not much information given about them in the previous books.As with other stories in this series, there are some very steamy love scenes. If you find this offensive, then you might want to refrain from reading this book. Parents may not want their children reading this book even if they are a teenager.I absolutely love Melissa Foster\u2019s books, and this one did not disappoint. I was not as hooked as I was some of the other books, but that was barely noticeable. This is probably because I did not know the characters as much as I did in the previous books. I give this book 4 \u00bd stars out of 5.So, head on over, and pick up a copy of the book, Lovers at Heart. You will not be disappointed. Make sure you have time to read because once you get started you will not want to put it down (and you will want to get started on the next book).I received this book to review through Beck Valley Books Book Tours, all the opinions above are 100% my own."}, {"userName": "Ceecee", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21728976-ceecee", "userReview": "A wonderful tale that brought me to tears!It didn\u2019t take long to figure out that the Braden\u2019s are going to be just as amazing as the Snow Sisters. The sibling rivalry seems to be a defining characterization in Foster\u2019s books, which makes them seem more realistic. In this installment we follow Treat and Max, six months after the Snow Sisters tie the knot.Treat\u2019s such a doll and his backstory has an amazing component that just makes him even more endearing. He\u2019s a wonderful son, brother, friend, and lover. Although his stubbornness can be frustrating, it\u2019s inconsequential when considering his personality as a whole. I love how hard this man works for Max\u2019s love, and how much he tries to protect everyone he loves.Max has never believed in love at first sight and she\u2019s learned first-hand how cruel men can be. Frightened she\u2019ll end up hurt or resented, she takes several detours that made me want to shake her! It was nice to finally get to know this hard- working super woman a little better, though. For two people who have so much control over their lives, they really made a mess of things. It was very entertaining as each stumbled across the path of self- discovery, and faced their fears. Both have understandable hang-ups that keep them from real happiness, and both are incredibly compassionate people. There\u2019s a sensual tub scene in this that is simply divine, and although it didn\u2019t involve sex, I feel it\u2019s the most erotic moment in the book!Foster does an excellent job with the alternating narration, which flawlessly keeps you inside Treat\u2019s and Max\u2019s head. The characters are always so relatable, I can picture people that I know every single time I read one of her novels! She tugged one of my heart strings with Hal Braden\u2019s BHS. I laughed, I cried, and as usual, I tried to figure out who was going to be hooking up next!

Now Melissa is an exceptionally successful and popular author with a dedicated following and I can see why. Her work is high quality and her writing style is tight and efficient. I actually really enjoyed reading this book, although I thought a few of the plot reaches were getting a little bit into the realms of fantasy. To me, that doesn't actually matter because this author has found a formula that works for her and sells books - more power to her. I did have a difficulty, however, with the absolute perfection of her characters. I kept waiting for the short, balding, fat man to appear in the story, but of course, he never did. All of the Bradens and the women in the story were perfect specimens. But really, does every male character have to be 6 foot something, incredibly buff, with a 10 inch penis? I mean - way to go to make us feel inferior Melissa. Joking aside though I must commend Melissa on her erotic/sex scenes. She has this down to a fine art - rest assured Melissa they work!!!!!Although it is not my preferred genre, reading such well constructed, well written stories can only improve my own writing and for that I am grateful to Melissa Foster. If you're a Melissa Foster fan, and there are plenty of them out there, you don't need me to tell you how good she is, but if you've never tried her and you like hot romances, then her numerous series could be just the thing for you. An excellent book and a wonderful read."}], "description": "Handsome, wealthy resort owner Treat Braden is used to getting what he wants.
