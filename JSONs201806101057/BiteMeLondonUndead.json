The author managed to cram a lot in a short amount of pages without making the story feel rushed or overstuffed. Maisie can't catch a break. There is a zombie outbreak in London and it is every human for themselves, but when she stumbles upon a family about to get attacked, Maisie feels compelled to help. Luckily, just as she herself is about to be overwhelmed by zombies, a lone werewolf, Seth, steps in to offer his assistance. Though the two have an instant attraction, they both have other things on their plate- like how the zombie attacks seem more and more coordinated and how they are both going to survive a deteriorating London. What was good was the pacing and the strong heroine lead. I think there are some promising elements here and could lead the way to a nice little series. However, I also had a few little niggles with this book. It really, REALLY annoyed me when all of the characters kept saying \"idjits\" over and over again. What is wrong with good, old-fashioned \"idiots\"??? It was odd and it got under my skin. I also thought that the chemistry between the two characters fell totally flat. I didn't get much a sense of heat between then and when they had their final sex scene, I could barely focus over my incessant yawning. I did enjoy the writing and so I think I would read more books by this author, but I hope that she steps her game up a bit for the next installment. **Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**"}, {"userName": "Jillian (NetGalley Addict)", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9844373-jillian-netgalley-addict", "userReview": "Carina Press provided me with an ARC copy of this book through NetGalleyZombies walk the streets of London at night, people are no longer safe and the werewolves have come out to the humans to help them.

They are attracted to each other, but with zombie attacks becoming more coordinated and guilt getting in the way, can Seth and Maisie even make a relationship work. I really liked this book; it was a great fast past quick read. The back and forth banter between the two main characters was easy and had me laughing at Maisie spunk. The secondary characters were great and added even more witty comments to the story.

And then created this book... just for me. What? It could happen.So, what sort of things make me swoony? Werewolves? CHECK! Zombies!? CHECK! Fierce chicks who don't let a little thing like a bad leg slow them down? CHECK! Hot kisses? DOUBLE CHECK! World building I can get behind? OH, YEAH!Let's start at the beginning, shall we? I like werewolves. I like them a lot. I especially like it when they're naked. While these werewolves don't get naked quite as often as I would like (please note that's my totally subtle request for more nudity in the next book. *innocent look*), there was some nicely naughty nudity. So, score on that point! Seth... well, I liked him. He might have a little anger issue when certain topics are brought up but that's to be expected. He's honorable and he SAVES KITTENS. *swoons, complete with a dramatic hand to forehead* Seth, you had me when you smashed that first zombie's brain into mush.Then we have Maisie. Again, I liked her. She might be on her own but that doesn't make her helpless. She can shoot straight and she gives awesome head... shots. She's fierce and she protects the people she can. That's not to say that her nighttime rambles are the best idea ever (they're not) but sometimes you do crazy things during the zombie apocalypse. I GET THAT.I seriously have a craving for more set in this world. I like the city on the edge feeling. I like the pack dynamics. I like that there's one wolf out there trying to figure out why all this is happening.More please.

I don\u2019t have any sort of relationship with the author and requested this one on the basis of the cover and blurb alone.This one was shorter than I expected, but boy did I enjoy it. London has been taken over by Zombies and the London Werewolf pack has come out of hiding to help in the fight against them. Humans are having to adapt very quickly to their strange new world and some seem to be coping better than others! I really enjoyed the thought of London as this desolate wasteland, the only people who live there too poor or too stubborn to leave. I loved the mention of landmarks that I recognized too; it helped me to really visualize the story.The characters in this story meet very early on to the book and are attracted to each other pretty much instantaneously. I dealt with that plot easily because it is a common theme in PNR books. I did have a little bit of an issue with how quickly they engaged in sexual activity. It felt a little bit out of place with the previous events in the tale and, personally, I feel I would have preferred there to be a greater passage of time between near-death experiences with Zombies and the two of them getting it on. I suppose adrenaline and sex do go hand in hand though\u2026.The brief look that we got at the pack Alpha Seth really intrigued me as to his character. A gruff man, we only mainly see him in his liaisons with Maisie, but even then you can tell just how he commands authority. I am a sucker for the \u201cprotective\u201d urge of Alpha characters and this came across in the way he tried to feed and clothe her as he could tell that she had very little (Not in a pity way\u2026more in a \u201cYou are mine\u201d way..). He was also sexy as hell JMaisie was a bit of more difficult to relate to. I loved her feisty attitude and willingness to help the injured Seth but I couldn\u2019t help but roll my eyes at the situation that she put herself in in the first place. It felt like a woman, who was on crutches and couldn\u2019t run, shouldn\u2019t really be going out walking in a zombie hotspot on her own at the dead of night. I couldn\u2019t fault her for the outcome, as she saved a family and met Seth, but I just felt the situation shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place!I did enjoy the chemistry between the characters and the world was completely fascinating. I hate to say this (and you know I do; this comment pisses me off to even type it) but I do think it could have done with a few more pages. There was a hell of a lot of back-story, world-building and romance to fit into a short book and it\u2019s a credit to the author that I managed to get a firm grasp on all of it. The thing that suffered for me was the end which was a little abrupt. It didn\u2019t spoil the overall theme for me though.This is a good novella to introduce a new series and I have to say I will be picking up the next one as soon as it's out. The world-building was amazing and the introduction of werewolves into zombie-torn London was bound to keep me engaged. I will be reading more\u2026 especially if there is this much sex in it... It\u2019s very steamy J"}, {"userName": "Carey Sabala", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6574584-carey-sabala", "userReview": "For my PNR fans, OMG what is not to love about this book!?! It's got Zombies and Werewolves!!! And no, even though the cover might lead you to think that it's a Zombie romance, it's not, LOL. Ok seriously this is a great read for anyone who's a fan of Zombies and Werewolves. So let me give you my little synopsis.London (of course, it's where the Zombie Apocalypse is taking place, if you didn't know?), has had a Zombie outbreak with no cure in sight. Most humans have relocated to other parts of the world but the city's poor, still remain in the interior. Like the survivors we are, life inside the city is starting to get back to some assemblance of normal even under the circumstances. Zombies amble around the outskirts of the city for the most part with a few stragglers wandering inside the city, which is where the Werewolves come in. With the Zombie outbreak, the Werewolves had to come out of hiding, so they decided to play the hero card and have become policemen of sorts. They patrol the streets and kill the Zombies along with human police and \"big game\" hunters, whom come to London to shoot the Zombies for a fee (clever huh?). Anywho, one night, while patrolling, the Alpha of the Werewolf pack, Seth, hears screaming in the park. He charges head long into the fight, only to stop short. Pressed back up against a Peter Pan statue is a small family and a lone girl defending the family against a Zombie attack with a shot gun. He immediately jumps in to help and wouldn't you know it, she freakin' shoots him too, WTH! Is this a love match or a death match? You'll have to read it to find out, LOL.As for our heroine, her name is Maisie and I adore her!!! She's a vet assistant with heart of gold, who's survived a Zombie attack and makes the best out of a bad situation. I want to be Maisie when I grow up, and I don't ever say that about a PNR heroine. She's smart, sassy, a survivor and her spirit and heart leap out through the pages to the reader. Ok, I'll say it again, I adore her!Alright, alright, I'll stop kidding. I didn't want to give too much away because it's not a long book but it sure is worth the read. As you know, I read a freakin' lot and I love my PNR. It takes a lot for me to sit up and notice a book but this one had me from the get go. What I loved was that the base characters of the Zombies and Werewolves were left alone. What I mean is that the author didn't try to reinvent the wheel. She left the basics of the much beloved monsters alone and worked a story out of that. Your Zombies are slow, flesh eaters, rotting their parts away although they are showing signs of something else at work and the Wolves are smexy hot guys that grow furry but have a built in honor and want to help protect anyone they can (gotta love them). I'll stop gushing now and just say this, if you love PNR, love you some Zombies, want action, romance and super hot smexy Wolves, give Bite Me a try, you won't regret it! I definitely want more and hope, hope, hope with all my heart that this book leads to a long lived series."}, {"userName": "Anne Dirty Girls' Good Books", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4504593-anne-dirty-girls-good-books", "userReview": "[ Maisie was attacked and has been unconscious.

The world-building involved in this story is seriously epic! When you see Maisie protecting a family from a horde of zombies despite her physical disabilities you instantly fall in love with her character! Maisie is tough as nails and brave beyond belief, she's faced zombies before and willing does so again to protect others on more than one occasion and while she's protecting a family from being devoured she meets Seth, a werewolf with anger issues not used to smiling anymore but for her, he smiles. Watching Seth push her buttons to get his way was lots of fun and hearing his inner indecisions on how to pursue her brought a smile to my face on more than one occasion. Seth is so strong, so alpha, but watching how his feelings for Maisie turn him inside out makes you like his character just that much more. Bite Me made me an instant PJ Schnyder fan and I cannot wait to see what she has in store for us in her next London Undead installment.

A zombie plague has broken out in London, plunging the city into chaos. Maisie is on her own in the city trying to make it day by day when she encounters Seth during a zombie attack. Complicating matters is the fact that Seth is a werewolf. Ever since the zombie plague has started, werewolves have come into the public eye to help patrol the streets of London. Seth happens to be the leader of London wolves and is patrolling when he comes to Maisie\u2019s aid.Maisie and Seth are immediately drawn to one another; however, with the whole plague thing going on, romance can be a little hard to come by. But the pair make due and Seth ends up being rather sweet to Maisie. I did find the romance to be a little rushed, I always find it a little odd when people have such strong feelings about each other in such a short period of time \u2013 but since it\u2019s a novella I\u2019m not going to complain. Plus, I really liked Seth and how he was determined to win Maisie.One thing that was hard to get used to was the language that Seth and Maisie use. They\u2019re both from London, so they use modern slang and since I\u2019m not from London, it was something I had to get used to.Overall, I enjoyed this one, and I\u2019ll be on the lookout for the next one in the series.

All words I use to describe Bite Me by PJ Schnyder. The first book in her new London Undead series sets the stage for what promises to be an interesting new series. The book describes a modern day London that is run down and desolate since a zombie epidemic started some time in the past, prior to the start of this story. The zombies are those from myth and legend - mindless, decaying creatures that seek out fresh \"meat\" in an endless quest to quench its hunger.\u00a0Left in London are those who didn't have enough money to escape before the quarantine, zombie-hunting \"tourists\" and those who profit from the \"tourism.\" Somewhere along the way, werewolves also outed themselves to the humans. The werewolves work with the human police to help eradicate the zombies, as they are immune to the zombie virus and exceptionally strong.Seth is the alpha of the local London wolf pack. He has an easy, unspoken relationship with the local constables, working in tandem to keep the streets safe. Under Seth, and one of his confidants, is Danny, a werewolf scientist trying to uncover what causes zombieism. While out on rounds one night, Seth comes across a captivating young woman, full of spirit, trying to save a family from some unusually fast and well-orchestrated zombies. After helping her with the rescue, Seth escorts Maisie to her clinic, where the pair become fast friends. They also indulge a bit in their immediate and intense attraction.Bite Me focuses much of the story on the budding relationship between Seth and Maisie. Theirs is a passionate, yet sweet romance. Maisie was crippled in the past after a zombie attack, and her affliction brings out Seth\u2019s need to protect and take care of her, even though he knows she is more than capable. At first it was sweet how much he wanted to help her, but I have to say, having Seth carry Maisie everywhere began to be a bit off-putting after a while. She is a grown women who can obviously hold her own and has balls made of steel. So why so much carrying?!Regardless of Seth\u2019s \u201cpampering,\u201d the pair share an intense attraction. They have that immediate \"I need to rip all your clothes off and start sexing you up now\" kind of powerful draw. Yet Seth remains the consummate gentlemen when he shows extraordinary restraint after Maisie gets him all worked up. I enjoyed their moments together - both the sweet and the sexy. Wrapped around the love story is the mystery of why groups of zombies have become more systematic in their attacks. The wolves notice that instead of mindless creatures that feed as the opportunity presents itself, they are coordinating attack efforts and searching out prey. Trying to figure out the cause and who is masterminding the strikes, especially as it hits close to home for Maisie, adds a bit of thrill to the story. All-in-all, Bite Me is a delightful story that hits all the important aspects I enjoy when reading: humor, a bit of intrigue, and a sweet romance with a bit of fire. Ms. Schnyder has created an interesting new world with hints of so much more to come. I look forward to finding out more about the werewolves, but also I want to know who is controlling the zombies and why. I strongly recommend this title for those looking for an entertaining new paranormal series."}, {"userName": "Kathie (katmom)", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5153260-kathie-katmom", "userReview": "This is the first book in a trilogy. Therefore it needs to bring us all up-to-date on just how this world came to be. The thing that brought this down a rating for me is the huge info dump that started the book. There is a way to get that much needed information to the reader in a much more natural way than just filling the narrative up with information. I found myself skimming, quite a bit, over the first several pages.Once the back story was out of the way, this was a fascinating new world that caught my attention and I most definitely ceased my skimming.Maisie can shoot like a military sniper: cleanly, calmly, and with deadly accuracy. Seth comes upon her and a family just as zombies attack. He sincerely hopes that she realizes that HE is helping them, while he's wearing fur, and she really shouldn't shoot him. But then she does. But that was to save him. Trust me, it makes sense when you read it. Instead of being enraged, Seth is intrigued by this sprite of a girl who can take care of herself. When she takes him to the clinic where she works to get patched up, I did laugh, while HE was offended. Once they are past that, there is something about her that he wants to protect and cherish. Of course, convincing her of that might be harder than fighting off a hoard of zombies.I enjoyed the supporting cast and will most definitely be watching for the rest of the books in this trilogy.3.5 Bookmarks, rounded to FOURA wonderful start to an exciting world"}, {"userName": "Future Slayer Girl ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5302761-future-slayer-girl", "userReview": "Ok, I kind of loved this book. The story started out a little slow, and I was kind of lost in the first about 10%, but once the plot got moving I realized that I was falling totally in love with all the characters. I mean how can you really go wrong. You have zombies, you have super zombies, you have werewolves, and you have a totally awesome lead female character that I could relate to and look up to while reading. It is always so much better when you want the lead female to get her HEA. The whole book was written very much as if it was a movie. The scenes flowed seamlessly into the next and the author did an amazing job and building the tension to the point that when it finally unfolded I sucked in my breath and went NO WAY! P.J. is a very strong writer to fit in all the desired elements of an erotic romance--especially with zombies--in a very small package.

Not since the zombie outbreak turned London into a literal dead zone. As common as it may be, though, Seth has no intention of letting it go unheeded. Chasing the echoes of the scream into the nearby park, Seth is stunned to see a pretty human woman standing over a small family, fiercely protecting them, her guns blazing at the horde of walking dead attacking them.Maisie knows she's in a world of trouble. Her ammo is running out, the people she's trying to save are so petrified they can't even help themselves, and the zombies attacking aren't acting like the zombies she's depressingly familiar with. These are faster, their attacks coordinated.The huge, half-shifted werewolf that suddenly appears and starts tearing through the zombies with brutal efficiency startles her at first, but Maisie can hardly complain about the much-needed assist. Maybe she'll live through the night after all. But if these new, faster, more intelligent zombies are indicative of a shift in the zombie population, it's going to take more than a sexy alpha werewolf and a tough chick with guns and a limp to save what's left of London. It'll take a miracle.~*~Wow, this was such a fun read. Frankly, I wasn't expecting to like it nearly as much as I did. I'm not a fan of zombies, so I tend to avoid books that feature them, but I was curious about the mix of shifter romance and zombie apocalypse in this novella. I thought I'd give it a chance, but my expectations weren't high. By the end, every one of those expectations were greatly exceeded. Despite the short length of this novella, there is an abundance of world building, plenty of action, and enough depth of character that both Seth and Maisie were more well-rounded than I'm used to reading in stories of this length. And the tale is written with a fast, engaging style and has a healthy serving of humor that appealed to me, despite the bleak post-apocalyptic London setting and the zombies that made it that way.Both Seth and Maisie were quirky, completely likable characters, especially the indomitable Maisie, who I adored, and their chemistry was off the charts. The relationship between them built up a lot faster than I normally prefer in my romance, as the entire story timeline takes place over a couple of days, but Seth and Maisie acknowledge that in the narrative, and that, along with the fact that Seth's werewolf nature allowed for a bit more leniency from me about that, served to mitigate any serious issue with how quick they get to their Happily Ever After. Or...well...potential HEA, as the Ever After in the story is fairly dependent on those zombies being dispatched sooner rather than later. One of the things I liked most about this story was the wealth of emotional baggage each character is dragging around. Seth has the weight of his responsibilities as pack alpha and the lingering damage from his former lover's betrayal. Maisie is still struggling with the guilt from surviving the zombie attack that killed her family and has a damaged leg and a permanent limp as a daily reminder. Neither one of them were exactly normal and well-adjusted, but both of them were just three dimensional enough to keep from coming off as cardboard cutouts of real people.There were a surprising number of twists and turns in the plot given the story's shorter length, but I do wish there had been a bit more attention given to fleshing out and better defining the external conflict of the story. That particular plot element was fairly thin, with so much of the story space having already been allotted to building up the foundation of the world and the characters themselves.It actually took me awhile to recognize that there was a specific thread of external conflict going on in the unusual zombie attacks occurring around the city. There was just so much else to focus on that it didn't even occur to me that the tidbits of information about them were being woven into both this particular story's arc as well as the larger series arc until the story started cresting into its climax. Because of that, the end of the story seemed a bit rushed to me and didn't quite answer all the questions I had, nor resolve all the issues.Some of that is understandable as part and parcel of being a series debut, but given how everything else was given such perfect attention, I felt the loss. But because everything else was given such perfect attention, and Seth and Maisie did such a good job stealing my heart, it was a loss I can easily live with. I wish this had been a full-length novel. And not because I would have liked seeing one or two elements have a bit more room to really be explored in the story...though that is part of the reason. Mostly, though, I just wasn't ready to be finished with Seth and Maisie's story. I loved them so much as characters and a couple that I wanted to spend more time with them both. On the bright side, if Schnyder's goal, like P.T. Barnum's, was to leave them wanting more, Schnyder achieved the hell out of it. I want more from her as an author and more of this series.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley.

The two species separately are looking for answers about the source of these creatures. The werewolves are immune to the infection and may be powerful allies for humans, but mistrust and prejudices between the two species make it impossible for an alliance. Vampires and fae keep themselves for now outside of everything, but in the future in the series I think they could change their minds.Few people walk the streets of London since the zombie outbreak, but that's not an issue for Seth. As a werewolf, he can handle himself and save humans reckless enough to take a nighttime stroll. While on patrol he comes across a group of people under attack. The one woman brave enough to take a stand against the zombies catches his eye\u2014and not just because of her way with a gun. Learning the beautiful woman is homeless and fends for herself only intensifies his urge to protect and care for her.Maisie can't help but admit that she's attracted to her werewolf rescuer. She's drawn to Seth's strength and ferocity, and finds herself opening up to him in ways she never imagined, even though she's determined to not rely on Seth or anyone else. She doesn't want another person to get hurt\u2014or die\u2014for her sake. She has enough scars, physical and emotional, from the last time\u2026But when Seth realizes something is drawing the zombies to Maisie, there may be nothing he can do to save her\u2026The plot and the setting are very good, and the reading very fluent with an alpha werewolf definitely interesting and hot.Maisie, for her part, is hardly the classic damsel in distress clueless . Is a badass chick and this makes her truly exceptional.There is always a subtle irony in dialogues between the two characters, which makes it very entertaining their trade of beats.I really liked the ending of this book and I am really curious to see how the story will evolve and if others creatures like vampire and fae will be introduced in the future.Thanks to Netgalley and Carina Press for the book.Primo libro della serie London Undead, che sembra essere una serie molto promettente, nella quale umani e licantropi si trovano a fronteggiare la minaccia creata da zombie e nella quale le due specie separatamente sono alla ricerca di risposte sull'origine della nascita di queste creature. I licantropi sono immuni all'infezione e potrebbero essere dei potenti alleati per gli umani, ma diffidenza e pregiudizi tra le due specie rendono impossibile un'alleanza. Vampiri e fae invece si mantengono per ora al di fuori di tutto, ma non \u00e8 detto che in futuro nella serie non entrino a far parte dei giochi, visto che vengono nominati nel libro.Poche persone osano avventurarsi per le strade di Londra durante la notte, dalla comparsa degli zombie, ma questo per Seth non \u00e8 un problema. Essendo un licantropo \u00e8 in grado di badare a se stesso e aiutare gli umani in pericolo durante le sue uscite notturne. Durante una sua ronda si imbatte in un gruppo di umani sotto attacco. L'unica donna coraggiosa tanto da tenere testa agli zombie difendendosi cattura l'attenzione di Seth, e non solo per la sua capacit\u00e0 nel maneggiare la pistola. Il sapere che la giovane donna \u00e8 priva di una casa, aumenta ancora di pi\u00f9 l'istinto di proteggerla e prendersi cura di lei, che il licantropo prova nei suoi confronti.Maisie non pu\u00f2 fare a meno di sentirsi attratta dal licantropo accorso in suo aiuto. \u00c8 affascinata dalla sua forza e ferocia e si ritrova ad aprirsi nei suoi confronti in un modo che non le era mai capitato prima, anche se \u00e8 determinata a non far conto su Seth o nessun altro. Non vuole che un'altra persona rimanga ferita o muoia per salvare lei. Ha gi\u00e0 abbastanza ferite, fisiche ed emotive, che hanno origine dal passato...Ma quando Seth si rende conto che in qualche modo gli zombie sono attirati da Maisie, c'\u00e8 il rischio che il licantropo non possa pi\u00f9 intervenire in suo aiuto.Trama e ambientazione carine, molto scorrevole nella lettura e con un licantropo molto alpha e decisamente interessante.Maisie da parte sua non \u00e8 certo la classica damigella in pericolo sprovveduta e svenevole. \u00c8 una tipa tosta e questo la rende veramente eccezionale.Presente sempre una sottile ironia nei dialoghi tra i due personaggi, che rende molto divertente i loro scambi di battute.Mi \u00e8 piaciuto molto anche l'epilogo di questo libro della serie e sono veramente curiosa di vedere come evolver\u00e0 la storia e se verranno introdotte anche le altre creature tipo vampiri e fae in futuro.Si ringraziano Netgalley e la Carina Press per il libro."}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7001837-marlene", "userReview": "Originally published at Reading RealityBite Me is a very cool little novella, with some neat worldbuilding and a sweet/hot romance at its center.It\u2019s also gritty, post-apocalyptic and absolutely a tease for the next books in the series.pride and prejudice and zombies by seth grahame smithThere are lots of stories where the vampires come out of the coffin or the werewolves stop hiding behind the full moon, but this is the first one I\u2019ve seen where it feels like Pride and Prejudice and Zombies got thrown into the mix, and I mean that in a totally good way (I loved the first one, but the joke went on too long).In Schnyder\u2019s dangerous new world, an absolute pandemic of zombies is hunting London in mindless, flesh-eating packs. No one knows how the plague started, but now there seem to be only two options; you run or you fight.What little law and order is left to hunt the zombies has been augmented by the London werewolf pack. Weres are immune to the zombie virus. So are fae and vampires, but those supernatural creatures have yet to expose their existence in the light of day (or night, as the case may be).So the werewolves are attempting to protect what\u2019s left of the city\u2019s inhabitants, along with the help of the police. Most of society\u2019s infrastructure is pretty much gone. The people who remain inside the quarantine zone hang onto life by their bloody fingernails.Maisie operates a veterinary clinic. A surprising number of insane idiots come from America and other less-infected places to go \u201cbig game hunting\u201d for zombies in London, bringing their pets and their hunting dogs.Seth is the alpha of the London werewolf pack. Their worlds shouldn\u2019t connect. But when Seth finds Maisie calmly shooting down a zombie horde in Hyde Park with pistols in both hands, he\u2019s intrigued. He likes her practicality, and he\u2019s appreciative of the excellence of her aim.He intervenes, not because she needs help as because he can\u2019t resist her blend of death and moxie. He thinks he has all the time in the world to court her the way she should be.Then he discovers that the zombies have not only evolved, but that they are targeting her.Escape Rating B: I always want more worldbuilding. This novella is both short and the first book in the series, so as much as I enjoyed it, I kept wondering how the zombie plague manifested, when, and what happened in the first few years of reactions. Also what was the reaction when the werewolves pitched in to patrol.I didn\u2019t say \u201chow the zombie plague started\u201d because people don\u2019t see to know that. I can accept that it might not be known, and that part of the longer story arc is the hunt for both cause and cure.The London that is being overrun by the zombies feels like it is dying. It almost felt like the story was steampunk or alternate Victorian, not because there is steam technology but because life is reverting back to historic patterns as the standard of living falls precipitously.There isn\u2019t a lot of time for character development, but there are hints. Both Seth and Maisie carry deep emotional scars, and neither of them is used to relying on others for assistance. They wake something up in each other, mostly because neither of them wants to need another being, ever again, and yet they are both achingly lonely. Two practical minded, independent people who are perfect made to face danger together.I\u2019m glad I started this series after three books are out; it means that I can dive into the next one (Sing for the Dead) right away!"}, {"userName": "Kristin (Blood,Sweat and Books)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6974252-kristin-blood-sweat-and-books", "userReview": "Bite Me is a book that I came across while browsing through Netgalley's catalog. As always seems to be the case I was looking for something else entirely when I came across this title. What instantly turned me on to the story was the fact that it had Werewolves and Zombies. I can't really recall reading a story that combined the two before. Any apprehension I was having knowing it was a romance went out the door the moment I read that.What really drew me into Bite Me was that the book started off setting the world instead of thrusting the eventual couple together. As a non romance reader I had plenty of time to warm up to the main character Seth before the romantic elements kicked in. Speaking of the characters, I really came to care about Seth, Maisie and to an extent Brian and Danny as they try to avoid the undead all while living life as best they can in a vastly changed London. Maisie is such a strong yet meek character wrapped all in one. She's complicated and I liked that. Seth on the other hand is all power. He exudes confidence and that is what makes him the perfect Alpha for his pack. On the character front I really have no complaints. It's impressive how much we learn about the characters considering the length of the book.Another thing I really enjoyed about Bite Me was its paranormal elements. I liked that the werewolves didn't have to hide. The police and public know about them and have even recruited Seth's pack to help keep in check the undead threat. I also (of course) loved the Zombies. They were unique in that once killed they rapidly decomposed and within hours would turns to dust which means you can kill one and move on without worrying about disposal. Now the Author hinted that other paranormal creatures exist so it will be interesting to see if they make appearances in later books or not.My only real complaint with Bite Me was the ending. Instead of giving the main story some sort of satisfying first book conclusion were treated to pages of steamy sex between the characters instead. Now I realize this was bound to happen since it is a romance novel but it actually felt a bit out of place and greatly reminded me of interactions between Andrea and The Governor on The Walking Dead. Now if you don't watch The Walking Dead let me explain. In the show the story would go from Zombie killing action scenes or harrowing supply runs to those between the above mentioned characters where they would either be flirting, kissing or shagging. Alone they would work but combined it stopped the story progression in its tracks. Now I wanted the characters to have a HEA and yes that included the sex but I would've liked it to happen in the next book not shoved onto the end as it was. A little more teasing and a little less pleasing would've bumped this story to 5 Stars for me. As it stands though it felt tacked on and did nothing for me.Overall, Bite Me was a surprisingly good read for me. I cannot wait to see where the story goes in the next book and I'd highly recommend it for Zombie and Romance fans alike. If you're looking for a fresh perspective on the Zombie Apocalypse then you definitely need to pick up this book. With that being said, I'll be rating Bite Me by P.J. Schnyder \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384368-joe", "userReview": "A novella in a new series from PJ Schnyder released today. If you are listening to what I say at all, there is a better than even chance you are a fan of the undead. Or more specifically\u2026 zombies. If so, this is your wheelhouse\u2026 your jam\u2026 or whatever the kids these days are saying. As long as they stay off of my lawn.London is being overrun with zombies. Barricades have been set up to keep the zombies in and from going wild over the country. Of course those blockades are also keeping the humans stuck inside. This brings us to the meeting point of our two heroes. Maisie is a human fighting the undead and protecting the living. I would almost venture to dub her an womanly version of Daryl Dixon. A total zombie killing badass (but with feelings).Seth (our other hero) comes upon her saving a group of people. He is the alpha of the London werewolf pack. The London pack has recently outed itself to the humans in an effort to help protect them from the outbreak of zombies. They are also trying to figure out what caused the outbreak and how to eliminate the virus. Not the least of which is due to the zombies starting to hunt in a more organized fashion.As PJ\u2019s editor put it during a Google+ meetup interview they did over the weekend, a zombie hunter romance as opposed to a zombie romance story. The physics if the latter is just\u2026 um\u2026 ew. This is like many good zombie stories and more about the survivors and less about the zombies. Also not nearly as apocalyptic as the Walking Dead. It meets in the middle giving us more opportunity to explore the romance alongside the zombie dispatching.What the author does, and does well, is she keeps pacing, gives us a solid plot. All the time keeping it real. Which is to say that the sexy bits are definitely sexy \u2013 as you would expect from a romance writer. At the same time the action scenes are realistic and believable. As you would expect from someone who knows how to fight. I\u2019ve see a video of the author\u2019s right cross. Though the solidness of it has no bearing on the review. Really. She only scares me a little.If you are a fan of paranormal romance looking for a little more action, a bit more horror, or even just a new setting for your shifter hotties, pick this up. If you are an urban fantasy reader that understands that people sometimes shed the clothes and get crazy, you should also pick this up. For my part the entire thing felt a bit more urban fantasy, but the relationship between the two does lean it more towards the PR category. Fans of both I think will be pleasantly surprised.And if you enjoy the novella, the second entry in the London Undead series will be out in November. So a short wait to get your next fix. Overall I am going to give this one\u2026 5 StarsMore because of the zombies, the action and the quality of writing than the author\u2019s wicked combination punch.

P.J. has blended paranormal romance with the looming zombie threat in the now dangerous city of London. What a way to blend all the elements.***FULL REVIEW***Seth helps his medic, Danny, collect samples from a zombie before eliminating it. He then heads on the remainder of the patrol of his territory London, sending Danny back to start researching and testing. Hearing a scream with his sensitive hearing at night when few brave the streets, he heads toward it to find zombies after a woman and a family. Maisie went for a walk at night with her irritation at her landlord, when she came across a family running from zombies. She pulls her faithful guns to help protect the family. Her ammo is running low as the zombies narrow in. The zombies are acting different, organized. And this can spell trouble for many.The world here is dangerous. The people who didn't have the money to leave or get out soon enough are stuck in London with the quarantined area. Zombies appeared a little over a year ago and stay in this area. Werewolves are great allies to have against the zombies, humans have finally accepted their help in patrolling and killing zombies but people are still nervous, yet they are more scared of the zombies at the moment. Seth's under the scrutinizing eye of not only the council and other packs but the vampires and fae.Seth is strong in his feelings of the zombies, and magic. Kill them and don't use it. He has a history with both. Seth is a caring man, and an Alpha. He wants nothing more than to protect his area and eliminate any threat. Danny is a scientist through and through, working out the how, why, and what to do to cure or stop the virus. The humans have moved to slow to recognize the symptoms and to many have become infected. To many innocents have died or been turned.Seth sees something more in Maisie with her lack of fear in her personal moves, towards zombies and him, and relaxed personality. She's one heck of a shot with her guns too. Seth's instinct is to help Maisie, get her food and off her crippled foot, is strong in Seth. Maisie is special and upon first meeting Seth, ends up in his strong arms. Maisie finds a physical attraction there curled next to his firm chest.I enjoyed this sweet romance. P.J. has blended paranormal romance with the looming zombie threat in the now dangerous city of London. What a way to blend all the elements.This is definitely a romance read. There's a blooming relationship with hints on more to the world and zombies. The focus is the growth of caring and love in this dangerous time, but I do hope in the future stories we learn more of the questions about the zombies posed from this read. I'm looking forward to reading them to find out."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6979254-judy", "userReview": "This is the first book in the London Undead series by P.J. Schnyder. I am not normally a big zombie fan, so I will be honest and say that if not for the werewolf in the blurb, I would have probably passed on this book. And I would have lost on a great new voice. At only about 90 print pages, this isn't a major time investment, but it sure does pack a powerful punch. There is so much going on, I can barely believe the author managed it to get it all in, especially as I never felt like things were too overly rushed. Yes, things move quickly, but for all intents and purposes, London has become a war zone. Emotions are heightened, actions are magnified and responses are accelerated. In other words, the speed of their courtship seemed appropriate in the circumstances.The story starts off with Seth, the London pack leader, helping draw blood and tissue samples from one of the zombies that has infested the city of London. As pack leader of the local Werewolf clan, he has gone public to assist the country with policing and protecting those who were unable to escape a zombie infestation that brought the paranormal to national and public attention. One of Seth's wolves, Danny, is a medic and biologist who is trying figure out where the zombies have suddenly come from. Seth sends Danny back to the lab to go ahead and start running tests on the samples, and continues on patrol. It is not long before he comes across some humans fighting off zombies and jumps in to intervene.Maisie had gone out for a stroll to clear her head, and stumbled across a small family trying unsuccessfully to escape from a zombie. Before long, the screaming and yelling attracted more and more zombies, till Maisie reached a point of last stand. Just as she was concerned about running out of ammo, a werewolf showed up and started assisting. Maisie was able to get the family to head off to safety, but she knew that she would never be able to make a run for it. Especially with her injured leg she received from a previous zombie attack. Seth finishes off the zombies and realizing why Maisie couldn't run off, decides to carry her back. And thus begins the courtship and romance of Maisie and Seth.I loved the unique voice and vision that I experienced with this book. It was the perfect blend of Paranormal Romance and Urban Fantasy. Maisie was a smart mouthed kick ass chick and Seth was all snarly Alpha. I gave this book 4 stars on Goodreads and happily dove right into book 2."}, {"userName": "Christina T", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/648076-christina-t", "userReview": "Despite this being a novella of less than 100 pages I thought this story was a great introduction to PJ Schnyder's writing and her new London Undead series. I love books with zombies and I'm so happy that this one didn't try to portray any zombie as a hero. They were dead disgusting buggers and I loved reading about them.What Worked: I think Schnyder did I commendable job introducing us to her London Undead world. Although we might not have all the information we could have had if this had been a full length novel I think what she was able to accomplish was a great start.Her characters are strong and intelligent. I really liked that our heroine, Maisie, could take care of herself without fear freezing her up. I liked that Seth recognized her strength and although it is in his DNA makeup to take care of her he knew she could do it herself.I also liked that Schnyder doesn't have the characters falling into insta-love because there wasn't enough time to develop a longer courtship. I was quite satisfied with the way the characters came together in the end.What Didn't Work: Just a few minor points actually. The length of the story really limited a longer courtship, the background on the characters and the world building. As I mentioned before, I think PJ really did a great job within the novella limitations but as a reader I just wasn't ready for the story to end. I could have happily settled in for another several hours worth of reading about these characters and the Undead world. Seth and Maisie's story is not finished. I hope PJ has realized this and plans to write more about them in the future. Oh and Seth's playful way of tossing Maisie up into the air repeatedly while carrying her was a bit much. Coming from someone with a bad leg, the jarring would have hurt. See, told you they were only minor points.In a Nutshell: A new Urban Fantasy setting well worth the read but I'm begging you PJ, please, please, please give me more!

The high points were, first and foremost, the writing. It was smooth, really well written. The hero is an alpha werewolf/shifter and his actions when he realized the heroine was his mate were believable and at times quite funny/cute. It reminded me a bit of the Beast when he was trying to woo Belle. The setting and world-building were very well done, too. When I finished I went straight to the author's bio to see if she was from the UK. Nope! The language and details of a zombie-infested London made me feel like I was watching something on BBC. I didn't get a lot of sexual chemistry between Seth and Maisie, but the emotional relationship worked well for me. It's hard, especially in a novella, to nail the instant attraction thing, but I liked how in a short amount of time the relationship progressed fairly naturally (taking into consideration how an alpha pack leader would act when he discovered his mate). Maisie was a strong, capable heroine even with a physical impairment. And not because she had unexplainable kickass moves or strength, she was smart. She knows how to defend against zombies because of learning from living in a world with them.
