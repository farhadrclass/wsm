It's a six-star book. A political thriller and metafictional, it works brilliantly and seamlessly. Starnone has a deep and haunting grasp of the world. The translation, moreover, is stellar - it sounds/reads as if it were written in English. No higher praise is possible.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "First Execution begins as a tale of political intrigue. Domenico Stasi, a retired teacher, goes to meet a former student, Nina, who has been arrested on a charge of 'armed conspiracy'. He's convinced this must have been some kind of mistake, and hopes to find her contrite, but instead, the unapologetic Nina sets him a task: he is to go to the apartment of a friend of hers, find a certain book and copy out a specified line, which will be collected from him by a stranger. When he complies, he finds himself drawn into a dangerous chain of events, in which he's unsure of the exact function he's performing; is he aiding the activities of terrorists? But then the story becomes metafictional: another Domenico, the author himself, appears in the narrative, talking about how he's writing this book, where he wants it to go, and how his own experiences and memories are feeding into it. The two stories run alongside and into each other, as Stasi's dilemma becomes more and more pronounced - he digs himself into an increasingly deep hole in near-comic fashion - and Starnone rewinds and reshapes his story, exploring the different directions it could take. The Stasi story is an examination of the effect of a certain style of education on young minds, with two extreme cases represented by Nina and another ex-student, Sellitto, who has become a police officer. The other narrative is a meditation on the nature of writing and the evolution of one's political beliefs. Both Stasi and Starnone seem tortured by the fact that they have remained outwardly apathetic in a time of upheaval, while feeling inwardly conflicted about their ability to empathise with both the oppressors and the oppressed. Stasi ruminates on whether his life has been wasted, having chosen to teach rather than to act - and how much responsibility he has to bear for the development of his students' ideals and, consequently, their choices.There is something brilliantly economical about the way First Execution is written. It's bursting with ideas - about politics, education, writing, ageing, justice and injustice, the nature and definition of 'terrorism', pacifism vs direct action... - and is filled with philosophical digressions, but they are expressed so clearly and beautifully that the book is a pleasure to read. I frequently found myself marking pages to remember, or highlighting passages that struck a chord with me (see the list of quotes below). It's intensely thought-provoking and challenging - but it's also a story I struggled to tear myself away from.---p.28: 'When had I tamed myself? It had been a lengthy apprenticeship, begun when I was as young as ten, and continued relentlessly throughout my adolescence, when I had discovered to my own terror that I wanted to murder somebody: my father, a sarcastic friend, my professor of Latin and Greek, even a rude passerby. It was not until I was almost twenty that I began to suspect that, along with the repression of my violent impulses, I had repressed everything, even my ability to experience a profound emotion, even my impulse to do good deeds and help others. I had become as good as I had hoped to be, but good with the cautious detachment of one who never indulges in excess.'p.39: 'His radical beliefs had always been considered a form of mental honesty. His own life story was first and foremost a history of the books he had read, and he eagerly recounted that story to himself, often with a note of self-deprecation.'p.57: 'Aging is the slow process of becoming accustomed to the end of real life. One must slowly abandon one's image, one's role, and resign oneself to fading in the memories of others, and in our own. How long had it been since he stopped learning the names of novelists, essayists, directors, singers, artists, and notable people in general? When had he begun to cling to his customary books without trying to read new ones, to his old movie stars without curiosity about the rising ones? Five years ago, or three years ago? His daughter Ida would toss out a name of someone who, in her view, was famous, and he'd shake his head uneasily: he'd never heard of them. Becoming grey, melted wax, formless. Perhaps that was the best way to prepare to die.'p.62: 'The mists of the Underworld evoked the hypothetical canopy of the Overworld. And that's where I've lived my life, he thought, saddened. In this den, reading, learning. Learning what? The mists of the Underworld, studied and pitied from a comfortable chair, in safety, at the edge of the canopy of the Overworld, in a distant warmth. He had spent a life without great luxury, but without serious privations.'p.67: 'It was as if\u2014he realized\u2014his blood was running cold, as if his ardor had cooled. He sensed with increasing clarity that the ferocity of political and military behavior, the deplorable actions of the world around him and the world that extended out in the distance, the scandalous poverty of the many and the scandalous wealth of the few, no longer instilled that old sense of determination in him. The very idea that demons don't war against demons, that one Satan never exorcises another Satan, but that there are always hosts of devils on one side and hosts of angels arrayed against them, now struck him as a piece of rank sophistry. At the heart of the battle it is not always so clear where good lies and where evil lies.'p.96: 'Real images (a ticket taker or the station sign\u2014Genova P. Principe\u2014or the station bar the way I'd seen it at four in the afternoon the week before) set off mental sequences and I lived in a state of distraction for a period that felt endless, but might last only a moment, a fleeting instant. Everything seemed to press in upon me with a vigorous coherence. But as soon as I attempted to marshal everything into written form, the story seemed to lack realism, sociological detail, a fundamental narrative syntax in a way that depressed me.'p.117-8: 'All the same, a secret part of me... was unable to avoid feeling affinity with the killers rather than the killed, with the kidnappers rather than the kidnapped. I deleted words of condemnation from my vocabulary, I tried not to use current labels. I was careful, even in my thoughts, to avoid using the words murderers, criminals, torturers, terrorists; I felt that they were somehow inadequate. I really thought of them as combatants. Of course, their actions filled me with horror, even fear, and yet the stand they were taking, the determination with which they were attacking, wounding, taking prisoners, and taking life as if they were metaphysical surgeons doing battle with a tumor, led me to feel somehow, I'm not sure how to put it, indebted to them, almost as if I owed them something for having acted in my place, sparing me, at least for the moment, tensions, anxiety, and disgust. That \"so?\" from Nina, that sign of the impossibility of any reconciliation, both frightened me and fascinated me. What a beautiful day, I thought. So? So? So?'p.121: 'Good job. You did a good job of shedding blood. In order to eat. In order to occupy someone else's land. To defend yourself. To drive off invaders. To defend sources of water or oil wells. All of these things on this huge verminous ball that day and night a malevolent scarab beetle rolls through a vicious circle, an obtusely fixed orbit in which war follows upon war, massacre follows massacre, and genocide is succeeded by fresh genocide. I carefully swept the balcony, raising clouds of luminous dust.'p.122-3: 'I had grown old without understanding, and there was nothing to understand. In the final analysis all that mattered was the warm March breeze, springtime, the light striking the wall across the way, the consoling colors that conceal the indecipherable nature of the world. A stream of images\u2014actual, fantastical, dreamed, and remembered. A word, fired by the vocal cords out through the mouth, in a volley of sounds: gutturals, palatals, dentals, labials, nasals. Conciliatory sounds and signs. Or perhaps not, perhaps conversation does not reconcile, does not pacify, does not keep company. We use handsome words to record ugly things, we agree on plans of attack, ambushes, mockeries, genocide, destruction-reconstruction-destruction. We speak violence and we call it the quest for food, hunting, caste, class, competition, market forces, liberation, and the new world order. Perhaps the culminating horror is the seed of the words that describe it.'p.164: 'Both of us\u2014we discovered\u2014had long and secretly suspected that Stasi was a gullible impostor, that his way of depicting himself was seductive precisely because it was invented out of whole cloth, for our edification and consumption, and for his own.'"}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3386994-jill", "userReview": "After enjoying another book by the author, Ties, I decided to try an earlier book by Domenico Starnone. While I appreciated the writing style and the creativity again, I found the alternating story lines hard to follow. I was enjoying the story of the professor, Stasi, but then the author of this story steps in with his point of view (author as a fictional character) and I had trouble staying interested. Some people find this incredible clever, but I just lost interest.

Having read My Brilliant Friend (yet to be reviewed) I can see how that theory might have come about.Starnone\u2019s novel, First Execution, posits the idea that education shapes our world view, just as Ferrante does in My Brilliant Friend. He also depicts a relatively violent world, where emotional restraint is in short supply, one that is deeply divided between the rich and the poor. This is something Ferrante does, too. Are they one and the same author? Who knows? To be honest, it doesn\u2019t matter.The Execution is a brilliant novel brimful of ideas and theories about politics, education, terrorism, war and justice \u2014 among others \u2014 and I came away from it feeling as if my mind was slightly blown. This is a good thing.The book opens with a retired teacher, 67-year-old Domenico Stasi (note the similarity to the author\u2019s own name) finding out that Nina, a former pupil, has been charged with \u201carmed conspiracy\u201d. Stasi, who taught his students to fight for what they believed in, feels partially responsible \u2014 did he contribute to Nina\u2019s desire to become a terrorist?To appease his own sense of (misguided) guilt, he visits her \u2014 they have coffee together in a cafe \u2014 but then finds himself caught up in Nina\u2019s world:She asked me to go to the apartment of a friend of hers. The apartment had been empty for some time, her friend was overseas, she handed me the keys. On the bookshelves in the living room I would find a copy of The Death of Virgil, by Hermann Broch. On page 46 a few words had been underlined. I was to transcribe those words and place the sheet of paper in an envelope. Soon, someone would show up and ask for the envelope. That was all.This puts Stasi in a difficult position: should he do it, or say no?

Lei gli chiede un favore che sembra mettere a rischio la sicurezza dello stesso prof., mentre nella storia trovano spazio le interferenze narrative dello scrittore che la sta scrivendo. \u00c8 dunque un metaromanzo thriller, questo di Domenico Starnone, e usa le riflessioni su anni di piombo, idealismo e amarezze post-militanza per creare un clima plumbeo e parlare di disagio, insoddisfazione e un po\u2019 anche dell\u2019invecchiare. La linea narrativa dello scrittore che scrive la storia non \u00e8 un racconto-cornice: le due trame sono interlacciate, una storia prosegue e completa l\u2019altra, entrambe sono frammentate nella convivenza impossibile tra pi\u00f9 scenari, tra diversi esiti contrastanti. Quando la focalizzazione passa da un piano all\u2019altro rimane un senso di continuit\u00e0, l\u2019atmosfera non cambia. L\u2019espediente fa per\u00f2 calare la tensione, opponendosi ai meccanismi pi\u00f9 tranquillizzanti del thriller: paradossalmente, per il lettore sarebbe pi\u00f9 rassicurante che la tensione non calasse mai, in un crescendo lineare; il meccanismo su cui gioca invece Starnone \u00e8 disturbante, mette a disagio il lettore spezzando apparentemente l'inquietudine. Ma in realt\u00e0 la storia progredisce anche attraverso la vicenda secondaria, quella narrata dallo scrittore, e la sua voce si mescolata a quella del professore protagonista del suo romanzo. Il gioco post-moderno su cui si basa Prima esecuzione prevede un\u2019oscillazione continua tra le diverse voci narranti e il mescolarsi dei loro punti di vista. A tratti appare persino un narratore esterno, che per\u00f2 finisce sempre per trasformarsi in uno dei due narratori interni. Il protagonista in fondo \u00e8 soltanto uno: lo scrittore e il professore, sua proiezione solo leggermente distorta, costituiscono un personaggio univoco. Il romanzo accumula una stratificazione di plot paralleli, dove il protagonista pu\u00f2 prendere decisioni diverse, contrastanti, facendole coesistere; Starnone crea una simulazione di contemporaneit\u00e0, in un universo dove di ogni cosa \u00e8 vero anche il contrario.\u00c8 una buona lettura, anche se \u00e8 tutto un po\u2019 risaputo, gi\u00e0 sentito, gi\u00e0 letto; e anche se il gioco \u201cmeta\u201d riesce ad accentuare il clima da incubo, rimane comunque un po\u2019 artificioso, forzato."}, {"userName": "Stephen Durrant", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1457001-stephen-durrant", "userReview": "Most of what I would like to say about this excellent novel has already been said well by other \"Goodread\" readers, so I will not repeat their comments.

Like Death of a Salesman, First Execution makes the most sense to me when read through an existential lens. Though I can understand why readers might assert that First Execution is primarily about politics, or terrorism, or morality, I see it as, fundamentally, a novel about meaning, or, more precisely, non-meaning. It's about what happens when a man living in a post-Christian age begins to question whether his convictions are rooted in transcendence or merely superimposed on a reality he himself has constructed. As he loses confidence in his categories, and even in language itself, he comes to perceive his own identity as something flimsy, arbitrary, and absurd.It\u2019s this delving into the non-meaning of things that leads the narrator/protagonist to the despair-inducing realization that \u201cnothing changes, it\u2019s all equally senseless. Both the journey toward the Sargasso Sea and the rejection of that journey end in death. And so?\u201d (122). The fictional (or not-so-fictional) Starnone who narrates this novel therefore concludes, \u201cDon\u2019t investigate, don\u2019t delve into the meaning\u2014the non-meaning, the non-sense\u2014of words and actions, at my age it could be dangerous\u201d (149). But that's exactly what he does, of course.I loved everything about this novel: it\u2019s honest examination of the implications of man\u2019s rejection of transcendence, as well as its ingenious composition. And though it\u2019s become sort of uncouth these days to pry into the mysterious identity of Elena Ferrante, especially after the Claudio Gatti debacle, I think this novel gives readers ample reason to hold fast to the theory that Starnone is indeed the voice of Elena Ferrante, and that the Anita Raja business was perhaps just a way to throw us off the scent.\u201c\u2026it took a special kind of genius to convince someone that he is not himself but someone else\u201d (33).\u201cIt is so absurd\u2014this determination only to write about what I know directly, this stubborn limitation of the imagination\u201d (52)."}, {"userName": "Marlys", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1620750-marlys", "userReview": "\"A narrator/author, Domenico Stasi, is writing a story about events from his own life while adapting these events to the needs of his fiction, telling his story and then backing up and rewriting his plot, while also experimenting with characters.\" -- Amazon customer reviewI've just started this, am finding it intriguing so far. ...however, I couldn't finish it (highly unusual for me.)
