It was meant to be funny, but somehow I found it almost demeaning to Christianity, to the South, and to the intelligence of working-class people. Henry Dampier did not ring true to me, nor did Preston Clearwater, our bad guy, nor Mrs. Albright, the cat-lady next door. In fact, I could not find a single character here that seemed possible and the plot was equally unbelievable. I could tell that Clyde Edgerton might well be able to write a good novel and perhaps some edgy humor, but this book fell flat and at some point about \u00be of the way in, I was just wanting it to reach a conclusion.

It was amusing at times, but I never laughed out loud. The story was good, especially with the flashbacks of Henry's life so you learned how Henry became Henry. The story takes place in North Carolina between 1930 - 1951. Henry has been raised a fundamentalist Christian and if you have ever found yourself in that situation, you understand what this boy is going through. All through this novel he keeps reading passages in the Bible, trying to reconcile them with other passages in the Bible and what he has been taught by those around him. One of the other characters I liked in this book was Uncle Jack. He was a bit irreligious and not quite like the other grown ups in Henry's world.One day when he is hitching a ride, a car thief picks him up. That begins the saga of stealing cars (and doing other assorted crimes). Henry may be innocent but he's definitely not stupid. Things start to seem a little odd to him at some point, leading to the eventual conclusion of this novel.A quick, easy read."}, {"userName": "Camie", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7399266-camie", "userReview": "Henry Dampier is a wet behind the ears 20 year old just trying to make a buck ironically enough by selling donated free bibles all the while grappling with their accuracy since he's been brought up a strong fundamentalist.

The book has it's humorous parts ( mostly involving cats) and is a twist on the usual coming of age novel as Henry smartens up, meets a girl, and tries to make good.

In actuality it was boring. The part that was praised as funny on the back of the book? *yawn* I didn't see anything good coming out of the book, what with the scams here and there... I felt bad for the Bible Salesman guy in that he couldn't get good answers to his questions about God (he was punished for asking questions in school, and while at home he was told it's okay to ask questions, I didn't see anyone explain the issue at hand) and inconsistencies in the Bible (he highlighted the inconsistencies, but I didn't see him seeking out what it could mean).

Flashbacks profile Henry's wide-eyed childhood in small-town Bible-thumping North Carolina. The tone of the book is actually quite sweet and very often funny (there was a recommendation from David Sedaris on the cover, which piqued my interest).

Henry is in his early 20s and despite being a Bible salesman -- kind of, sort of -- he struggles with contradictions in the Bible. He also isn't much of a deep thinker, or perhaps he just appears that way because it's a good strategy to avoid conflict. (Like knowing who you're really dealing with.)The story itself ends very abruptly, and, I thought, rather predictably.

That was all right in the case of Jincy Willett's Jenny and the Jaws of Life--which, despite not being uproarious as Sedaris claims (it's actually kind of depressing), has other redeeming qualities, such as being really, really interesting. This book...not so much. It's an ambling Southern tale, set in the 1950s, and at times it is, indeed, sort of quietly amusing. There are also occasionally interesting ruminations on religion, but none of that really goes anywhere, nor do the periodic flashbacks build to much of anything.

His characters had a depth which engaged me to some degree. This isn't the case anymore, and it is safe to declare that I am officially done with my forays into his novels.You know, on reflection, I am downgrading this book to two stars. Summary: Naive, folksy youth gets caught up stealing cars with a man he believes works for the FBI. This witty quip-riddled boy is also a Bible salesman who acquires boxes of Bibles from a free service and proceeds to cut out the first page that states that they are of no cost, and then he sells them to folksy people.

It was odd that this quick witted guy was the same naive guy. The plot was a little thin, the characters were a little thin. It all just felt a little flat to me, I was waiting for a big wow moment.

I know this because the daughter of a co-worker has decided to do just that.The bible doesn't seem to be a good book that people can freely discuss without sharply contrasted and heated opinions with a measure of fear mixed in. Within this sacrosanct literature you will find confusing contradictions, shocking activities and lots of killing.In his innocence the bible salesman poses some questions which I've found myself wondering about. Can we quiz that person with the Old Testament doctorate?One might view The Bible Salesman as a metaphor for the drama that took place in the Garden of Eden. Innocence and evil intent do a rumba. The draw of this book is innocence: A question posed by Henry at 9 years old to his Sunday school teacher after hearing that God rested on the seventh day: \"How could somebody who is perfect get tired?\", the dialog between 12 year old boys in their bedroom at night, and the presence of the popular Southern Gothic devise: the man-child. (Not one but two: Yancy with his goiter and Randy, the Yancy-double) Like the snake fooled Adam and Eve into partaking in his evil plans, so does Preston Clearwater, a gangster, reel in the 20 year old bible salesman Henry to help him out in his mis-deeds which he claims to be undercover work for the FBI.Henry, always meaning well and while unknowingly being used as a pawn for criminal activity, must contend with his maturing sexuality, bringing home the bacon, and his relationship with God.

I was actually annoyed from the preface on (more about the preface later), but it was a quick read so I just finished it anyway so I could get to the totally cheap, unsatisfying ending where the protagonist gets off scot free and nothing more is said except that some anonymous \"colored boy\" takes the rap. Yeah, it's that bad.Also, the preface warns the reader about the Southern grammar in the book, that Southern grammar follows rules and so you better not judge it based on other rules, blah blah blah... as though no one has ever read \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" or any other novel with Southern characters. So, in sum, it's trying to be both folksy and condescending, and it about as unsuccessful at either as Sarah Palin.

The book is moderately funny, but in a guffaw kind of way -- if the old TV show \"Hee-Haw\" made you guffaw.The language is simple and blunt on purpose, but that deprives it of any charm or interest. In fact, if Edgerton wasn't an established popular novelist, his first few sentences would have resulted in this novel being thrown in the trash by any editor: \"A man driving a new Chrysler automobile along a dirt road near the North Carolina mountain town of Cressler saw a boy up ahead, dressed in a black suit, white shirt, black tie, with a suitcase and a valise by his feet. The boy was standing in front of a grocery store, thumbing a ride.\"The man, working his way up, belonged to a crime outfit. He was at the car-theft level, hungry for wealth and the tense excitement found nowhere outside crime.\"Very bland, for my taste.Anyway, here's the plot. It's 1950, and the criminal, \"Preston Clearwater,\" picks up the kid (Henry) and tricks him into being an accomplice. Preston has a violent streak, which somehow eludes Henry, though during their months together, Preston kills people, knocks out others with a crowbar, and carries multiple guns. Meanwhile, Henry has left home at about age 17 (not really clear in the book) and is making a living selling Bibles. It's sort of a scam, in that he gets the Bibles for free by lying, and he knows how to push people's emotional buttons to sell them a Bible. In fact, he's way more successful than is possible to believe. But Henry is a believer (we find this out through tedious flashbacks to his younger years in the late-1930s), and maybe that's what drives his success.Yet, while Preston lies to Henry by claiming they are stealing cars from criminals and returning them to the FBI, Henry also has an interior life he doesn't share with Preston -- namely, that he really does read the Bible and is trying to figure out its contradictions and how to follow its strictures about leading a good life. Henry's musings are, by far, the most interesting thing in the book, as he looks at the Bible's plain language and thinks about it. What to make of Abraham being told by Sarah that he can sleep with another woman -- does that give Henry license to have sex before marriage? What to make of Genesis, which seems to say that animals were made before man, but also says that men were made before animals? And so on.All this stuff comes to a head in the last 20 pages of this short book. Henry realizes that Preston is a criminal, and Henry has to figure out how to get out of the situation and how to square his own actions with his attempt to be Godly. At the same time, Henry has found a girlfriend and had sex with her (really? in 1950?) and wants to build a life with her. It's all lightly handled -- as light as can be with car crashes, theft, multiple murders, broken families and mental retardation. So if that's your cup of tea, then go for it. I like my tea a little stronger."}], "description": "Preston Clearwater has been a criminal since stealing two chain saws and 1600 pairs of aviator sunglasses from the Army during the Second World War. Back on the road in post-war North Carolina, a member of a car-theft ring, he picks up hitch-hiking Henry Dampier, an innocent nineteen-year-old Bible salesman. Clearwater immediately recognizes Henry as just the associate he needs--one who will believe Clearwater is working as an F.B.I. spy; one who will drive the cars Clearwater steals as Clearwater follows along in another car at a safe distance. Henry joyfully sees a chance to lead a dual life as Bible salesman and a G-man.During his hilarious and scary adventures we learn of Henry's fundamentalist youth, an upbringing that doesn't prepare him for his new life.
