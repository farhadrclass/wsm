From the start, Sean Michael Chick accurately summarizes the Overland Campaign, detailing the blunders on both sides. He doesn't let Grant off easily, as many authors try to do, noting at one point his \"almost obsessive preference for Sheridan.\" When the Army of the Potomac finally reaches the James River, Chick describes how Grant failed to inform key subordinates about the programme to seize the vital transportation hub of Petersburg. Even William F. Smith, who was to lead the assault, learned of his role very belatedly. That the Union Army, demoralized and fatigued from the previous forty days, badly lost the four-day battle for control of the town should come as no surprise. This is a must read for students of the Virginia theatre of war and for those of the Civil War, as a whole."}], "description": "The Battle of Petersburg was the culmination of the Virginia Overland campaign, which pitted the Army of the Potomac, led by Ulysses S. Grant and George Gordon Meade, against Robert E. Lee\u2019s Army of Northern Virginia. In spite of having outmaneuvered Lee,\u00a0after three days of battle in which the Confederates at Petersburg were severely outnumbered, Union forces failed to take the city, and their final, futile attack on the fourth day only added to already staggering casualties. By holding Petersburg against great odds, the Confederacy arguably won its last great strategic victory of the Civil War.In The Battle of Petersburg, June 15\u201318, 1864, Sean Michael Chick takes an in-depth look at an important battle often overlooked by historians and offers a\u00a0new perspective on why the Army of the Potomac\u2019s leadership, from Grant down to his corps commanders, could not win a battle in which they held colossal advantages. He also discusses the battle\u2019s wider context, including politics, memory, and battlefield preservation. Highlights include the role played by African American soldiers on the first day and a detailed retelling of the famed attack of the First Maine Heavy Artillery, which lost more men than any other Civil War regiment in a single battle. In addition, the book has a fresh and nuanced interpretation of the generalships of Grant, Meade, Lee, P. G. T. Beauregard, and William Farrar Smith during this critical battle.", "title": "The Battle of Petersburg, June 15-18, 1864", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453937-the-battle-of-petersburg-june-15-18-1864", "average": 4.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1429098216l/24453937.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12540304.Sean_Michael_Chick", "name": "Sean Michael Chick"}], "type": ["Military History", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453937-the-battle-of-petersburg-june-15-18-1864"]}
