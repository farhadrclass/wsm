Her adopted brother Shaun had to shoot her. Shaun is our narrator for this book, and he is a complete douche bag. He is constantly having conversations with his dead sister because he \u2018hears\u2019 her in his head, and he freely admits this to everyone. Yet if anyone (including his blogging employees) ask him about this, or bring up Georgia in almost any way, Shaun\u2019s immediate reaction is to punch them in the face. He makes no apologies and almost brags about it.Also, his immediate response to bad news is to punch walls repeatedly. Which no one is allowed to question him about, either. Yet we\u2019re supposed to believe that these journalist bloggers are so loyal to Shaun that they continue to overlook that he\u2019s violent and dangerously unhinged, and they go out of their way to avoid upsetting him. This is all supposed to illustrate how devastated Shaun is by Georgia\u2019s death, but it just makes him seem like a self-absorbed abusive fuck. \u201cIt\u2019s my own fault he blacked my eye, Officer. I asked him something he didn\u2019t like, but please don\u2019t arrest him. He\u2018s really a good guy.

One year has passed since Shaun and Georgia Mason found more than they bargained for as they investigated the truth behind the Kellis-Amberlee virus, a mutated cure for human disease that led to the uprising of the dead. The events that transpired then have an enormous impact now as the high-profile bloggers from After the End of Times uncover a conspiracy that is even bigger than they ever imagined. A CDC researcher fakes her own death in a spectacular fashion and shows up at their headquarters, and soon the whole team is battling zombies, mutant dogs, and the ever-present ghosts of their past.When I finished this book late last night, my thoughts were \"I have not a single criticism to offer. Not a single one.\" And this still holds true. Without exception, every question and doubt I raised with Feed is answered here. The action is incredibly intense, the story is densely and intricately plotted, and the book is exceptionally well-paced and exciting. Readers who are leery of zombies still shouldn't have much of a problem, because although there are more tense encounters with the undead, the violence is relatively contained and there are no gross or gratuitous scenes. Most of the terror comes from heart-pounding action and chase sequences, as well as the knowledge of the overwhelming consequences if the team fails in its quest for truth and justice.Shaun, Georgia, and Buffy all loom large in this sequel, but we also get to know the other staffers better, including the elegant Mahir, the fiercely determined Becks, the quietly steady Alaric, and the sad, tragic Maggie. Most significantly, however, the narrator has shifted to Shaun, whose personality comes through loud and clear in his bitterly funny words, his decisive handling of his team, and his desperately emotional struggle to hang onto what he loves most. Mira Grant met and exceeded every expectation I had for this book, particularly in the devastating truth that comes to light about what might have been. I knew from Feed to expect an emotional reaction, but I could not have prepared myself for the terrible knowledge that these characters have to face. I was literally whimpering from the pain, and tears were streaming so hard that I couldn't see the page.This is my third 5 star review for a 2011 book, and it is given with no reservations or qualifications. This is a searingly intelligent novel, with hard questions about medical ethics, government responsibility, and the nobility and folly of human nature. And just when you think the author has delivered everything she possibly could, there is a HUGE twist at the end that made me bolt upright and scream in the middle of the night. This twist has far-reaching consequences for both the characters and for society as a whole, and it also answered questions I had about the future in a crazy and unthinkable way.It will be another year before the third book in this trilogy will be released, and I'll spend much of that time waiting in agony to find out what happens to the characters I've come to care about so much. But oh my stars, what a pleasure it is to be so incredibly excited and thrilled and moved by an author's work.This review also appears in The Midnight Garden. An advance copy was provided by the publisher.REMINDER: DO NOT read the synopsis for this book anywhere if you haven't already read FEED, as it contains potential spoilers for the first book. And please do be careful of reviews that may spoil this one."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "[hey, shaun, do you miss george?? i miss her, too. she was less adolescent. why don't you go punch something?

I thought there were some technical problems with the world building, including how bloggers became the voice of a generation and helped people stay informed during the uprising. For one thing, I never thought conventional media would fail quite as hard as Mira Grant wanted me to believe it would and for another thing I always thought bloggers would spread a lot of misinformation as fact, you know, the way they do now. When I opened Deadline, however, I wasn't concerned about whether or not that was plausible anymore. I opened Deadline willing to accept everything all the world building in Feed. In fact, I'd completely forgotten about my old issues until I reread my review of the first book. Grant got a clean black slate with me and it didn't really work out too well.Before you move forward, I'm going to put a second spoiler warning here because I can't discuss anything if I'm worried about spoiling someone. Read the summary goodreads provides and then don't go near any spoiler-warning reviews. Regardless of what I think of the book you deserve to have it unfurl the way the author meant it to unfurl.Shaun's grief fueled behavior was ridiculous. It would have been suitable two weeks after George died or two months after George died -- but two one** freaking years? The dude has been walking around the office, not really doing anything resembling his job (either as an Irwin or the head of the site) AND talking to himself for two years? No. Just no. I don't want to hear any bullshit about how much he loved George and how lost he was without her. Listen up: people die. People you love die. People you've built your whole world around die. Eventually you have to get your shit together and handle it. You either find another purpose or you die right along with them. Given Shaun's level of grief you'd think he'd just walk out into a field of zombies and let them have him, but no he did have something 'driving' him. Shaun's 'other purpose' was finding George's killer, but he did absolutely nothing save talk to himself and punch people. His rage was the futile rage of a child, not a grief stricken man. If he was a teenager I might've given it a pass. At his age, however, he came off as an incredibly weak person and his constant breakdowns should've landed him in a mental hospital. He never pulled himself together and focused. The entire plot of this book arrived gift wrapped on his door step. He didn't dig and hunt or work to find George's killer. He had one prolonged nervous breadkdown and hit people a lot for two years.My next point: Shaun and George's relationship. I'm going to say this once. What the fuck was that?The sex scene between Shaun and Becks was well-written. It didn't shy away from details and yet it never got too graphic. The fact that he said George's name afterward blew my mind. My mind came back though and it was pissed off. George never presented her relationship with Shaun as anything more than familial -- albeit extremely co-dependent. (Okay, yes, it was more co-dependent than the Olsen twins, but they were still actively portrayed as only siblings.) How, after one full book written from a first person point with a character who was not only presented as a reliable narrator from start to finish but also presented as a character obsessed with the pursual of truth, did we end up with this weird surprise in the second book? How could George have been the person we thought she was and never know she was involved sexually with Shaun? I call foul. I can't accept that George lied for the entire first book so either this is part of Shaun's crazy delusions or I'm questioning Grant's storytelling integrity. I think Grant cheapened herself for shock value and I'm annoyed about it.And, no, I don't give a damn about the quasi-faux-incest. It didn't bother me in the Harper Connelly books; it wasn't what made the Mortal Instuments suck (the writing did that). What I don't respond well to is being lied to as a reader just so the author can have a gasp-y reveal. If you can't pull that off without flat out lying to me then you don't deserve me as a reader. There were ways to make that a reveal without destroying George's integrity as a character.Speaking of cheap, manipulative writing, I didn't think Dave's death in the beginning of the book was necessary seeing as they were hacking the building's security system. If it was a hack, why couldn't it be hacked from a laptop within the van? Maybe there was a reason and I glossed over it. I don't know. What I can tell you is that when you're trying to get me to cry over something you should handle the material with a light hand and let me arrive at those tears myself. Grant all but sucker punches you in the stomach and demands you cry. I obviously wasn't impressed with either execution or the content.The plot of the book... was somewhat interesting, although again it just arrives gift wrapped at the front door. For someone whose entire goal in life it was to find George's killer... Shaun was doing a crackerjack job. A lot of the plot involves running back and forth across the country with the CDC breathing down their necks as other people gift wrap information for them. Seriously, the first scientist Shaun approaches with the information hands him a sparkly career make or break story. Gift wrapped information even comes flying in from England! On top of all the 'an apple of knowledge fell into Shaun's lap' very few of his plans were particularly intelligent. It was mostly, let's kick down some doors and see what happens! It's not like they can kill us... except they already have and they haven't shown any sign of not doing more of it. Also, I didn't think their hide-out at Maggie's was particularly genius. If I was searching for a rogue group of reporters I'd start with friends, family, and ummIdunno other people working for the company. Genius plotting.The outbreak in the storm also annoyed me. Somehow everyone in the world knows about it except the three of them. Yes, they were off the grid, but they had a radio playing the ENTIRE time. They made several stops, at gas stations, rest rooms, and blood check points and there were no televisions or notices of what was going on?!? Just empty stores and security booths?!?! There should have been an emergency broadcast on the radio -- they should've known what was happening. Again, Grant sacrifices the integrity of her story and world building for a big reveal moment.Here's what I enjoyed: The book opened at a high pace and although Grant does eventually get lost in her own recapping she didn't torture me with it outright. Despite Shaun's stupid life choices I did enjoy the zombie's are gonna eat you all scenes -- of course, they're few and far between. Deadline suffers from Feed's zombies, zombies, zombies everywhere but here. The zombies are referenced constantly although not present often enough for my tastes.Back to Shaun's BIG DARK GRIEF. Fuck the coke. It got annoying. Fuck the bike. He deserved to die when he decided to ride on it during the biggest out break in his living memory. Had the coke and the bike not constantly been reinforced as important because it belonged to George then they might have both had some emotional relevance to me. instead we got fucking beat down with the bike and slapped around by the coke. Every single mother-effing time Shaun drank a coke I got annoyed. George's disembodied voice wasn't enough, going back for her black box wasn't enough, the bike wasn't enough -- no no the coke every twenty pages was absolutely necessary. Grant methodically made this devoid of meaning for me. Also, it would have been a lot more powerful had George not been in his head requesting it. If Shaun had done it without bickering with her about it or just because it reminded him of her I would have enjoyed it more. Fail.Oh... and George has been cloned? Fuck it. Where's my receipt? I'm returning this book-shaped bullshit. In my first review I commented on how I kept waiting for the strange releationship to bloom into something, but nothing ever came of it. Well something did come of it. We were just mislead and lied to so Grant could have a 'powerful' scene at the expense of reader's trust and her character's integrity. In my review of Feed, I also couldn't tell if George's death was a meaningful, brave approach to the novel or if it was cheap. The answer's in. Cheap. The cloning let Grant end Feed on a 'powerful' scene and then she takes it back at the end of the second book? Bullshit.I'm going to go lie down now and try to forget about this book. I need to go read Aftertime which I've been promised is a proper zombie novel I'll like. *crosses fingers* **Year confusion on George's death is somewhat addressed in the comments. I've come to the conclusion that George is only supposed to be dead a year in Deadline."}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "I am breathless, speechless and whateverless (probably mindless) at the moment.

I loved every single word of it.Deadline is one of those books that you want to read slowly, to savor every phrase, every discovery, every nuance, every little moment. Deadline is one of those books that you will carry with you long after you've closed the cover.Mira Grant has described a world so unique and so close to my heart that I won't ever forget - it's a special place where people live among zombies, it's a dangerous world where death is one step behind you. \u201cI just find it interesting that kids apparently used to cry when Bambi's mother died. George and I both held our breaths, and then cheered when she didn't reanimate and try to eat her son.\u201d\n\u2665 If you loved the first book as much as I did, you will have this world kind of figured out. You will feel like you're part of it, and you will enjoy every new discovery the characters make, and every twist into the story.\u2665 If you loved the first book as much as i did, you will miss some characters with your whole heart, you will feel Shaun's pain, you will cheer for him when he gets better, you will want to kiss him when he is so sweet that he melts your heart, you will want to hug him and keep him safe when he needs it.\u2665 If you love this series as much as I do, you will enjoy every shocking scene, you will hold your breath with every danger approaching, you will get to the end wanting more, you will laugh, you will cry, you will hope, you will die a bit with every loss, you will feel like you've been reborn reading the last words..There are things that you need to know, there are things that will break your heart, but also there are things that will fill your heart with joy - if the first book was a carousel of emotions, with this one you will get tickets for the entire amusement park.\nCHARACTERS:Shaun is the perfect (male) main character - sarcastic, charming, lovely, and just a bit crazy. Truth being told, he is aware of his situation, so I don't know if he really qualifies, but still I loved every bit of his 'craziness' because it got me close to someone that I really, really missed.\u201cI feel the closest to crazy when I'm disagreeing with the voice in my head\u201d I don't remember caring so much about a fictional character, but Shaun felt so real, his emotions raw and powerful, his sarcasm making me smile, his pain making me sad. At the end of Feed he had to make some radical decisions that left him being only a shadow of his old self, with his craziness as his only anchor keeping him somehow sane. He has only one purpose in life: avenge, and he is willing to give his last breath for it to become true.Kelly - I cared about her because she was prisoner in a world that didn't need her, in a group that didn't want her.. She knew that the truth has many faces, she showed them that the truth is not enough. It was sad because all that she had was this group of journalists, and there was no room for affection between them and her.\"There are truths the world isn't ready to hear. There are truths that are just too big\"I liked Maggie - she was different than the others. She was used to staying at home, with her pack of tiny dogs, spending her family's money in whatever felt right for her, writing poetry, watching horror post-apocalyptic movies, and the most important is that she was able to offer refugee for everybody in times of great need.\"And if there's somebody you love, tell them. The world always needs more love.\"Becks was one of my favorites too (how many favorites can I have?). She doesn't mind speaking her mind and she enjoys poking the dead with a stick. She would have made a good match for the old Shaun, wouldn't she?\u201cWhy is it you assholes always feel the need to tell the media your evil plans before you kill us?\u201d asked Becks. \u201cIs it a union requirement or something?\u201d\nMahir - Georgia's best friend from England. We only met him 'personally' at the end of part one, but now we got to know more about him, and to see him in action too.\"He was the only one who never questioned the fact that she still talked to me. Frankly, I think he was jealous that she never spoke to him.\"Alaric was the smart one, the one that was always one step forward, the one that knew the meaning of all those complicated things that me and Shaun never understood. He was there to explain to 'us' (theoretically just to Shaun, but I was almost always as clueless as he was), to show us the obvious, to make us see the truth when we had it in front of us and we couldn't cope with it.\"Ask her what would have happened if you hadn't pulled the trigger\"Want to know more?This book series is simply AMAZING, what you're waiting for?..

This is the second book in her Newsflesh series. The first book, Feed, was one of my favorite books of last year and may end up being one of my favorite books of the decade. Feed was an explosive reading experience for me because all my emotions were engaged. Mira combines the zombie myth with technology and on-line blogging that worked wonders. Feed had a very unique protagonist with George Mason. George lived and breathed reporting the news, blogging her complete obsession. And because of this, she was killed. George stumbled upon something big and not at all planned. She and her brother, Shaun found themselves in a world of political espionage where someone was using the zombies (that were unleashed on the world because of a cure created to combat the common cold twenty five years ago) as a way to control society and for their own maniacal greed. Deadline begins almost two years after the events of Feed and this time we\u2019re in Shaun\u2019s head as he comes to grips with losing George, his best friend and soul mate. Shaun still grieves over the loss of George and the guilt he couldn\u2019t save her. He was the one to end her life by shooting her as she succumbed to the Kellis-Amberlee virus running through her veins that would transform her into a zombie. But Shaun doesn\u2019t just have the memories of George to keep him company. George speaks to him in his head. He and she have full conversations. Is Shaun going crazy? Perhaps. But Shaun doesn\u2019t care. As long as George talks to him, he can keep on living and reporting the news.Shaun still runs his blog and has a new crew to help him. There\u2019s Rebecca, aka Becks, an Irwin, who likes poking zombies with a stick as much as Shaun used to do. There\u2019s Alaric, a Newsie trying to make strides as a journalist, Dave another blogger and Mahir, who blogs from London, England on behalf of Shaun. Then there\u2019s the eccentric Maggie, who\u2019s a bit on the wacky side, the daughter set to inherit her father\u2019s Pharmaceutical company who blogs about movies, the majority being horror ones. Shaun and his motley crew are very popular bloggers who navigate in a world gone to hell. The hungry undead have become a way of life and the only thing the living can do is be aware that this new type of threat is all around them and won\u2019t go away.Shaun would love to get his hands on the person or people responsible for injecting George with the virus that killed her so mercilessly He lives for revenge. And he may get his revenge when Dr. Kelly Connolly from the CDC comes to Shaun with shocking news. She planned her own death. One by one, each member on her research team has been killed, and she was next. The CDC not only is still trying to find the cure of the Kellis-Amberlee virus, but are involved in something straight out of a science fiction novel. They have created illegal clones and are experimenting on them. It seems the d Kellis-Amberlee virus may not be as dormant as the public believes. There\u2019s a big conspiracy that Shaun takes upon himself to investigate. Anyone along with him are in grave danger, not from infection, or from the zombies, but those people who would kill to keep their findings a secret until they decide to unleash it on the world. Deadline builds at a steady rate where you turn each page, uncertain what\u2019s going to happen. The first 500 pages moves slowly but doesn\u2019t bore you. Everything is metrically planned out, much like a ride on a roller coaster. You sit there in that small seat, your heart pounding as you climb up that rickety track, waiting to reach the top. And when you finally reach the top, you fall from such a height where your stomach drops down to your feet. Your adrenaline is running and you open your mouth as screams burst forth from your mouth. Deadline is a roller coaster of a book.Shaun really comes into his own in Deadline. I really couldn\u2019t stand him in Feed. He was an immature, spoiled thrill seeker who finally grows up and man\u2019s up after George\u2019s death. Shaun has iron balls and is not afraid to use them. He\u2019s on a mission and will die to find out the truth and bring down anyone who is out to destroy the world for a second time. He and his team are a cross between the characters from Scooby Doo and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Shaun is a one man Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein from All the President\u2019s Men. He\u2019s tenacious, dedicated to reporting the news and in the immortal words of Harold Beale from Network, \u201cI'm a HUMAN BEING, God damn it! My life has VALUE!'. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell, 'I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!\u201d Shaun is angry and more alive than he has ever been and wants to right the wrongs done to humanity and most importantly George.Deadline scared the living crap out of me. A quarter away from the end of the novel, the shit got very real where I was shaking in fear. I can\u2019t even tell you the last time a book made me have such a physical reaction. Talk about a doozy of an event that occurs out of the blue and one I never saw coming. And this isn\u2019t even the shocking OMGWTF twist of all twists that\u2019s announced in the last sentence on the last page. This is one of the best cliffhanger endings I read next to Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins. Your mouth will drop, your body will tense up and you\u2019ll be not only on the edge of your seat, but climbing it. Talk about a rush. I think I felt high the entire time I read.Deadline is as close to a perfect read as you can get. Every one of my emotions were engaged. Deadline will be in my top 10, most like my top 5 of 2011. This is a book that I want to squeeze tight as I lie in bed awake, so very afraid the undead will finally rise up and come for me, hungry for my flesh. Not many authors can make me jumped at my own shadow, but Mira has. I shake my fist at her for making me feel this way and yet I ask for moreSide note: There was a goof in regards to George\u2019s date of death. The year stated is 2032, when it should be 2039. When I read this, I was more than confused, but then asking Mira about it, she admits that it was a mistake that got through to the book somehow. Even with this issue, don\u2019t think Deadline isn\u2019t full of awesome. It is.

Even though I was sort of won over by George as narrator in the final few chapters of Feed, I thought Shaun was a better narrator and injected a bit more character into the series. I just really loved how Grant created a completely other side to Shaun in this book. I want to say soooo much more but I won\u2019t.Supporting Cast.YES. The minor characters in Feed take a step forward in Deadline and become much more prominent and I loved it. They all added so much to the story and the feel of the book and I think they all had great chemistry with each other. Loved this aspect of the book because I think it kind of opened the world up a bit so we could learn a bit more how the Rising affected other people. Also\u2026 I have to mention Mahir, the bumbling, long-suffering English gent who loves tea and whose complaints about the things that he has to do go ignored. Pfft, Americans and their stereotypes. *snorts into her cup of tea while complaining about the weather and reading ridiculous tabloid stories about Kate Middleton\u2019s fashion sense* Baddie.*zips mouth*Theme Tune.Zombie- The Cranberries.OK, we get it\u2026there are zombies in this book and this is perhaps the most obvious song and also\u2026 the troubles in Ireland have NOTHING to do with this book.

Not me!Well, actually, I do need to. But instead of studying, I spent all of yesterday reading Deadline by Mira Grant! Someone shower me with sympathy, because I'll definitely need some of it after failing staying up past midnight to study for my exams.Anyway, back to Deadline. It is the sequel to Grant's Feed, and it continues the story with Shaun Mason as our narrator. The plot is difficult to summarize without spoiling Feed, so just know that Shaun is out for blood in this book as he leads his motley group of bloggers to take down another conspiracy - this time, involving the CDC.Although this book did not blow me away emotionally like Feed did, it was similar in that it possessed an intricate plot that was well-paced and had no holes besides the ones that were supposed to be there. There was an adrenaline-inducing amount of urgency, and Deadline held me on the edge of my figurative seat almost the entire time I was reading it.While I preferred George as the main protagonist, Shaun still endeared himself to me in his violent/emotionally unstable/crazy sort of way. I came to love the side characters in Deadline, especially the amazing Asian Newsie, Alaric Kwong, and the affluent and abnormal Fictional, Maggie.If you read and loved Feed, you need to catch a copy of Deadline as soon as possible!

I don\u2019t want to live in a house that has tiny windows, so that anything about 40lbs can\u2019t get through, or have to endure blood tests at every entry or exit. I don\u2019t want to never again experience the joy of an open air concert or festival. I don\u2019t want to not be able to offer comfort to a stranger by giving them a hug, or holding their hand. I don\u2019t want to live in a world where I might have to shoot someone I love to save them from a fate worse than death. This is the world put forth by the author, and it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Almost 30 years after the cure for the common cold turned into hell on wheels, the world is still recovering from the devastation. Some parts of the world will never be reclaimed, and the effects of this disease roam the wilds, seeking to infect and feed. In Deadline, news blogger Shaun Mason is our narrator, and still hasn\u2019t recovered from events that affected him and his team in the worst possible way. When a CDC doctor fakes her own death and shows up, asking for his help, all hell breaks loose\u2026again. He\u2019s now on a mission to uncover a vast government conspiracy that could affect the whole of humanity and will uncover secrets that will certainly change his life, and those he cares for, forever...and he has nothing to lose.If you haven\u2019t yet discovered this superb series by Mira Grant (aka Seanan McGuire), then you\u2019re in for a wild ride. Feed and Deadline feature some of the best post-apocalyptic writing that I\u2019ve read, hands down. Not just zombie books, these novels explore the nature of fear in all its forms and will take you on an emotional roller coaster that will haunt you for days after you\u2019ve stopped reading. The characterizations are phenomenal, and the attention to detail is no less than it was in Feed. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to follow up such amazing work, and sometimes second novels in a series suffer a bit. Not Deadline. It\u2019s just as good as Feed, and you\u2019ll find yourself plowing through this 600+ page novel in no time. I missed quite a bit of sleep finishing this one up. Was it worth it?

Another Newsflesh novel nominated for a Hugo. I\u2019ve decided that everything I want to discuss about this book takes me into hella spoilers territory. So that spoiler flag I put on here? Don\u2019t ignore that if you were thinking I was kidding. I wasn\u2019t. From here on out, we will be knee deep in zombie guts and spoilers. If you want a non-spoilery review, check out Kemper\u2019s well-articulated reasons for this book\u2019s mediocrity. I particularly agree about the lack of actual zombie combat. What\u2019s up with that?I don\u2019t remember exactly how I felt about Feed after reading it, but I think I liked it but did not see it as a remarkable, Hugo-winning book. It had an interesting take on zombies and bloggers but was hobbled by less-than-stellar plot. Deadline, in my opinion, improves upon the pacing and structure of Feed quite a bit. However, its plot and characterization fall into the same old traps\u2014and this time, the zombie honeymoon is over. And I\u2019m coming for braaaaaains.I\u2019ll hand it to Mira Grant: Deadline is definitely action-packed and fast-paced, though for every \u201caction-packed\u201d scene, I suppose there is an accompanying scene of painfully slow dialogue and exposition as everyone stuffs more wads of cotton into their ears. The plot is convoluted owing in no small part to the fact that everyone in this book sucks at communicating. It seems like every time someone has something important, perhaps even life-saving, to say, they decide it would be better to sleep, or eat, or do something else and defer the conversation for the morning. Because that always ends up so well. And then when they do have a discussion, it seldom advances the plot or provides much new knowledge. Instead, the team has to go to some kind of nefarious research facility to hear the same thing, only this time from someone in a lab coat.So Deadline is fast-paced, but a lot of those pages are boring and somewhat unnecessary.Speaking of unnecessary, let\u2019s talk about Shaun for a moment. I\u2019m not a psychologist, so I won\u2019t pretend to understand how people react to death of loved ones and deal with grief. But I do think that the reaction of other people to Shaun\u2019s reaction to Georgia\u2019s death is unrealistic (at best). Setting aside the fact that Shaun hears Georgia\u2019s voice in his head and admits he is probably crazy, we\u2019re supposed to believe he has spent the past year moping around and doing nothing and no one has told him to snap out of it? I understand that the might not snap out of it, but the level of accommodating that his colleagues are being is unbelievable. In ordinary times, maybe I would buy it, but this is a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested wasteland. You want everyone on your party functioning optimally. Shaun \u201cI hear dead people\u201d Mason is not functioning optimally, and he should not be in charge.I suspect my experience with Shaun as a narrator is likely what other people feel when they cringe at Harry Dresden as a narrator. I love Harry; I love his smartass observations and dry, sometimes self-deprecating humour. To me, his voice is something that makes the Dresden Files books come alive. But I know some people can\u2019t stand him, and thanks to Grant, now I can empathize. Shaun is not a very good narrator. His repetitive reminders of the prevalence of blood tests, the genesis of Kellis\u2013Amberlee, the adoptive nature of him and his sibling all become so much noise. And meanwhile, I am asking, \u201cShaun, why are you wasting time visiting various CDC facilities when you could just post the information to the Internet?\u201dThat\u2019s the problem with not going full cyberpunk. Feed was innovative in the sense that it really tried to portray what a zombie apocalypse might be like in the post-Information Age. The combination of geographical upheaval and increased physical isolation to reduce the risk of transmission definitely increases the potential role of the Internet in everyone\u2019s life. But it behoves authors to consider how this affects everything and not just certain plot points that might benefit from it.Conspiracy thriller wisdom in the Internet age is pretty clear: when in doubt, leak it online. Shaun et al have contingencies in place to leave encrypted backups with friends and frenemies alike, ready to distribute the keys in case they don\u2019t safely return. That\u2019s prudent and great. And I understand the need to keep this information quiet and seek out second opinions personally in order to avoid alerting the conspirators that you\u2019re on to them. However, once your cover has been blown and they know that you know, why not release it all online? Post it everywhere, and make everyone party to the secret. It worked for another science-fiction conspiracy (TVTropes).Instead, Shaun and friends plan some kind of midnight ride on the CDC facility in Memphis. And Shaun decides to do it on a motorcycle. Yes, he wears Kevlar, but that\u2019s beside the point. It is not acceptable to go riding into a potentially zombie-heavy situation on a motorcycle. Does Shaun potentially have a death wish? Sure, maybe\u2014hence why I said above that he shouldn\u2019t be in charge. But all his friends, instead of stepping up and standing up to him for his own good, step aside as if everything is normal, and let him ride his motorcycle to his death.Well, kind of. He gets better. So does Georgia, at the very end. Yay for cloning and memory transfer! I\u2019m not actually all that bothered by this twist, or by Shaun\u2019s own miraculous survival. In order for this series to succeed, the Kellis\u2013Amberlee mythology needs to evolve; the potential for a cure is the next logical progression. I don\u2019t begrudge Grant making her main characters an integral part of that.Lastly, I guess I should talk about the incest. It makes sense, if one considers the family situation in which George and Shaun grew up. Their parents were attention-hounds, constantly seeking validation from the media and audiences in the form of ratings. This led them to treat George and Shaun as a means to an end, a commodity and resource rather than actual, you know, flesh-and-blood beings. With such distant affection from their adoptive parents, it makes sense that George and Shaun would look to each other for intimacy. Combined with the fact that I imagine it\u2019s harder to be intimate, physically or emotionally, in this world, and I can see how the potential existed for that relationship to ignite into something more than just sibling love. That being said, I have to agree with those reviewers who found it dubious that Georgia wouldn\u2019t mention it in her own narration. There\u2019s unreliability in one\u2019s narrator, and then there is just gaping omission.Deadline was easy to read, and that\u2019s something. I\u2019ve focused almost exclusively on what didn\u2019t work for me with this book, but the truth is that I could see it working for other people\u2014many of these objections are quite subjective. I\u2019m not convinced of Shaun\u2019s mettle as a narrator, and I\u2019m sceptical that Grant can deliver a resolution to this conspiracy that will satisfy me (conspiracy thrillers rarely do). And, as I said before, the honeymoon is over. The best things about Deadline were also the best things about Feed, and I need my novels to evolve as a series goes along, not stay the same. If it were up to me, I might not bother picking up Blackout\u2014but I suspect it will be on the nominations list for next year\u2019s Hugo awards, in which case we\u2019ll be doing this all over again.See you next year!My reviews of the Newsflesh trilogy:\u2190 Feed | Blackout \u2192"}, {"userName": "Tina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1552211-tina", "userReview": "Original post at One More PageOne of my best book discoveries last year was Mira Grant's  Feed, the first book in the Newsflesh trilogy. I was so excited about it when I heard it was about zombies AND blogging, and it was my first big Kindle purchase. It remains as one of my favorite books, one that I have given away as gifts and prizes numerous times. I was excited for the next book, Deadline, but I wasn't expecting that much, given that second books are usually so-so compared to the first books in a trilogy. I had a feeling it would be good, but I wasn't expecting it to be as good as its predecessor, you know?Deadline starts shortly after Feed, where Shaun Mason and the rest of the staff of After the End Times are still reporting the news and making noise in the blogosphere. Shaun, however, is no longer the Irwin that he used to be -- he's tired of it, and he's just running the news organization because he had nowhere else to go and nothing else to do. When a CDC researcher fakes her death and drops by their office with a lot of terrifying and confusing medical research, Shaun and the team find themselves in the middle of a conspiracy connected to the ones they encountered during the campaign. Hungry for the truth, they follow the trail, and find themselves facing an enemy bigger and scarier than the living dead that has become a constant threat in their lives.I decided to reread Feed shortly after Deadline was delivered to my Kindle to refresh my memory of the Newsflesh world. I was a bit impatient while rereading because I kept on seeing really good reviews for the newest book, but I soldiered on, determined to have the best reading experience for the sequel. It took so much control for me not to read reviews and comments in reviews in full, too, so I won't be spoiled (and believe me, there are spoilers galore in the reviews for this book). I finished the first book, loved it just the same, and then moved on to the next book. Not even 1/4 into the book yet and I was already crying. A little over that, and my heart was breaking. And then, I just can't stop reading it. I finished the book at one in the morning last Sunday and it took all of me to stop myself from swearing. If my mom wasn't fast asleep beside me, I would have yelled many, many expletives that morning.Mira Grant achieves a great balance between detail and action in Deadline. The previous book was admittedly wordy with all the exposition on the history of the Rising and the Kellis-Amberlee virus. Deadline may be just as wordy, but since the book is told in Shaun's point of view, we are given a bit of time to process the information in the same way as he does. There's less politics here, as it focuses on the virus itself -- lots of science, lots of medical terms, but not so much that it's too hard to follow. It's got good, solid world building, with lots of references to pre-Rising things, the things we have now. I love the references to zombie video games, most especially, and it makes the action scenes easier for me to imagine. There was a time when I was reading a zombie chase scene when something similar to a Resident Evil background music played on the TV. Talk about setting the scene. The story is tight, and it honestly had me totally creeped out as the story progressed. I had the same feeling while rereading Feed, but I dare say Deadline amplified that feeling. By the end of the book, I was ready to hide under the covers and never go out.While this is more of Shaun's story to tell, the girls Georgia and Buffy still play a big part in the story. The best part, I think, is how their staff gets to play bigger roles. Mira Grant created excellent characters that you'd want to be on your side when zombies walk with the living. I loved Mahir and Maggie (with her epileptic teacup bulldogs!) the most, but I also liked Dave, Becks and Alaric well enough to get attached to them even if I knew better not to get attached to any of Mira Grant's characters. Lines are blurred and gray areas abound in Deadline: the stereotypical villain in the previous book suddenly had more depth, there's no clear villain in this book, and there really is no one you could trust.Unlike Feed, Deadline ends in a major cliffhanger, which could have also resulted in many, many expletives if I hadn't finished this book late in the night. And to prove the evil (genius) that Mira Grant really is, a preview of the third book, Blackout, is included in Deadline (A word of advice -- do not read the preview if you're not yet done with the book. YOU WILL REGRET IT IF YOU DO, TRUST ME.). While that's a teensy bit comforting, it still doesn't change the fact that it would not be out until next year. Alas, I wait in agony with the rest of the world. :oDeadline by Mira Grant definitely exceeded all my expectations. I love it when a book does that. Even if I have to wait for a whole year for the conclusion of this wonderfully terrifying, expletive-inducing trilogy, I have a good feeling the third book will shoot straight up the ceiling with its awesomeness."}, {"userName": "Kimberley doruyter", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23952659-kimberley-doruyter", "userReview": "that ending.i garantie you will want to read the last book as soon as you can when you finish this."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5476515-amanda", "userReview": "Struggling a little bit with my feelings on this."}, {"userName": "\u2665Rachel\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5481477-rachel", "userReview": "Well that's a game changer.

Is it a conspiracy novel or horror/apocalypse? I felt like in juggling both, she did neither well, and it was setting up a very ridiculous set of odds against our protagonists. While I could see it potentially happening--as scientists attempt to \"control\" a virus, it mutates out of control in the wild--it seems like the science in the books is capable of both too much and too little. Writing-wise, with so little of the book paying attention to zombie-fighting or survivalist strategies, the development comes out of nowhere, and wrenches us back to zombie concerns.The reservoir stuff seemed kind of challenging to me, and I didn't really get what Grant was trying to do with it, despite my own science background. I think she was implying a route for human mutualism with the virus, but it felt more like it was setting up an eventual solution to the zombie problem more than a plot point for this book.

This time, it's Shaun that we get the pleasure to know even better, as he is the narrator of this sequel. After the events in Feed, Shaun is undergoing some very severe PTSD and mental instabilities. Let me tell you, this makes for some fascinating character development. I was absolutely taken by his situation. The prison he makes himself in his mind shows us how humans cope with certain traumas and I though it was especially well done and very... sad; however, underneath it all, somehow, it's also beautiful.The many characters walking alongside Shaun are not thrown under the bus as far as character building. Every single one has a place in my heart. Their personalities are solid, distinct. Their emotional states are palpable. They are not characters anymore, these are people that took me with them and made me a part of their journey.I was consumed by terror from the many intense events that occur in this novel. But, like the first, don't think this novel is about the zombies. Its setting is decades after the zombies came. Now they live, they survive, and they have been surviving for so long that the zombies are a way of life for them. Thus, the book involves zombies, sure, but don't expect The Walking Dead. The terror is not from zombies, the terror is from a messed up, crooked, twisted government that has it out for this particular team of bloggers. It's from finding out more and more disturbing secrets and manipulations from these \"leaders\". The zombies, they simply give off a constant worrying tone; you know they're lurking, and could be waiting for you at every turn. Isn't the unknown the biggest fear of all?From non stop action to immense characterization, Deadline was even better than its predecessor--which very rarely happens in my experience. The details are raw, vivid, inside a world that is extremely well built. Mira obviously has done her research to all the minute details, turning this book into the most realistic zombie fiction I have come across, yet.

It was bought for me by someone who didn't realise how much heart ache the first one caused me and I had nothing to read, which is why it took me about 39 years to get through. There will be spoilers. 1. The plot is, surprisingly, quite good. At least, it's an improvement on the first book. I know absolutely nothing about virology so for all I know Mira Grant is making the whole thing up as she goes along, but she seems well versed in it, giving the element of believability about that part of the story. I have to admit that it was the reason I kept reading, despite...2. Mira's inability to let Georgia go. I wrote about my dislike of her in my review for the first book, which was one of the reasons I gave this book a chance in the first place. No George! Except she's still there, on nearly every page. If she's not talking to Shaun directly, then it's being hammered into me that he drinks coke because it reminds him of her or that he rides the bike because it reminds him of her. It's obvious that Grant is not comfortable writing from his POV and so Shaun never acts like a distinct character in his own right, which means...3. Shaun is so infuriating, he makes George look like a rational, wholesome, decent human being. Grant seems to be under the illusion having a mental illness is something to ignore. Or worse, something that is cool and glamorous.. Hear your dead sister talking to you? Gah, it's just grief, punch anyone who (rationally) thinks you need help. WTF do they know?! Hell, 9 times out of 10, George is only there because Shaun Lol-I'm-so-stupid Mason can't grasp the simplest shit for himself. He tasks himself with finding out the truth about Georgia's death, though it becomes increasingly obvious as the book goes on he has no intention of doing any investigating besides waiting for evidence to land in his lap. He literally does nothing to move the plot forward, everything that happens is based around other people's efforts. If your expecting a roaring revenge tale you will be very disappointed. If you're expecting a strong, developed main character to get behind, again, you'll be disappointed. Shaun is an absolute idiot/arsehole. He has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and no, grief does not give you the right to act the way he does. He hears his dead sisters voice and no one does a thing? They can't, he constantly threatens to punch the holy shit out of anyone who dares even look at him funny, on a few occasions he carries out his threat and bones are broken. I don't give a crap, that is not an appropriate way to act, I don't care who you are or what has happened to you, you act like that and you deserve to be stabbed in the butt with a shit load of Valium and then carted off to the nearest mental institution. None of this 'he'll be better in the morning' nonsense, because he has what I would consider to be one nervous breakdown after another. It does not make for good reading. Shaun quote: As long as I'm punching walls, I'm not punching people. <--Someone get this dipshit to a doctor so we can move on, please? On one occasion, he sits there, grinning his little psycho grin and calmly tells Kelly: Continuing this topic is going to lead to somebody getting punched in the face. It could be you.I'm sorry, but no. If someone said that to me, grief or no grief, I'd claw their fucking face off and send it to their mother. That's not an acceptable way to act and Grant is doing nothing more than glamorizing mental illness, making out it's something that fixes itself, like it's no big deal. When it gets to the point of your own friends being too scared to say anything to you, it's time to stage an almighty intervention and stop it. It's not ok and I'm disgusted in the way Grant handled it. I absolutely loath Shaun, weird little man-child that he is. His entire character, his mannerisms, the way he thinks, the way he talks to people, the fact he's in charge and yet needs his dead sister to explain everything order to string even the most obvious plot devices together, he makes my skin crawl. 4; I was totally right about the incest thing! I knew it. My icky sex radar has yet to let me down. Of course, it's done in such a shitty way it's no big surprise. It struck me as incredibly...anticlimactic. It's obvious Grant thought it was some jaw droppingly awesome plot twist, something edgy or gasp-worthy. But it's not. The fact Feed is from first person, meaning everything is from Georgia's pov and so we learn everything about her from the fact she dyes her hair to the color of her contact lenses, means the little fact of HAVING SEX WITH THE MAN YOU'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP TO VIEW AS YOUR BROTHER having been left out makes the entire thing pointless. Whether or not Grant planned it all along (probably), it doesn't work. It's an eye roll moment. The story gains nothing from it other than to make you wonder what it actually has to do with the overall plot.5. Repetition. Repetition. More Repetition. I shit you not, page 1; Rebbeca Atherton, head of the After ThenEnd Times Irwins, decided it would be a good idea to go outside and poke a zombie with a stick'. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! DROP IT, MIRA. We're not even past page 20 and there's the dreaded blood testing kit. Someone needs to take her aside and stage some sort of rally, the lady is out of control. 6. As in the first book, the main characters are smug, self satisfied plebs. They love nothing more than posing with guns they never have to use because THERE ARE NO ZOMBIES, cracking witty one liners and (probably) imagining they are on par with rock stars. Everything that comes out of their mouths is basically a muddy translation of 'Holy shit, we are epic'. 7. Becks. Blegh. She's a bit of a Georgia replacement, except, astonishingly, more irritating. She sleeps with a mentally ill man, claiming it's just casual sex, that's all she wants, nothing more, nothing major...then goes into Major Sulk Mode when that's all it turns out to be. Because everyone knows when someone tells you they just want a one night stand that means nothing other than sex, they really mean they've been in love with you for ages and want a relationship. You should apologise for not reading their mind and realising they didn't mean what they said they meant. 8. Mahir. Oh dear. He is, very obviously, English. You're really meant to know this, because he may as well have turned up in a monocle, top hat and tails, waving a walking stick around and followed by a few corgis, dropping 'Good Lord!' and 'Bloody hell!'s all over the damn place. He's THAT British. More to the point, he's described as having a thick British accent. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BRITISH ACCENT. It makes my blood boil. If you're going to create an English character, at least understand the basics of his friggin country. He talks like someone out of a Charles Dickens novel, just read one of the American characters line of dialogue and compare it to his. It blatantly obvious we're suppose to think he's on par with Prince Charles in terms of poshness. Because all us Brits are. We all talk like the Queen. Good Lord. 9. The characters are just plain nasty. They're total bitches to Kelly and I didn't like it. Despite faking her own death, a move that means she's more or less finished, never to see her family or friends again, despite putting herself in the bloggers hands, despite doing absolutely NOTHING other than give the team what they want, they treat her like absolute shit. They even strip search the poor woman, like sacrificing her entire life, career and loved ones is just the casual move of some silly tart trying to be 'undercover' and not the calculated move of a lady very much on their side. If I'm supposed to think they're a bunch of hardcore badasses in the way they go about the whole Kelly situation, I'm afraid it failed, big time. 10. The tone of the writing seems to be getting worse. Every single page feature some ego-bolstering, witty one liners, like Grant is trying too hard to portray the characters to be something they're not. There's always some dumbass comment about how nuts they all are, how suicidal they all are, how terribly crazy you would have to be to be part of their group, how they take their lives in their hands EVERY DAY (except they don't, more on that next), just general heavy duty butt kissing. 11. WHERE ARE THE ZOMBIES?! I get that zombie novels, especially this series, are based on society, how it reacts, how to world changes etc etc, but damn, nothing happens. Once again, as in the first book, it starts with a bang and then that's it. Literally 400+ pages go by before there's anymore zombie action. This wouldn't be so bad if Grant constantly pressed about how much a dangerous place the world is. People hardly ever leave their homes and it's like...why not? The main protagonists, people who apparently risk life and limb on a daily basis, go weeks without being in any sort of danger (then it's situations they put themselves in) so I'm pretty sure the general population isn't exactly within deaths grasp every time they open a window. There is a point, that people could go into amplification at any given moment, meaning you could just zombify and then you and everyone around you is officially buggered, but why hide from that? If it's going to happen, it's going to happen, leaving the house and amplifying is no more dangerous to those around you than staying indoors, amplifying and eating your family members. this could have been about any type of virus, why sucker people into buying what they think is a zombie novel if you have no intention of creating any sort of atmosphere with them. Why create a world where people are scared to go past their front door and then be all 'What, zombies? Nah'. 12. The ending...blimey. It's...interesting. A total cop out, but interesting non the less."}, {"userName": "Limonessa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4147373-limonessa", "userReview": "[that Georgia could have been saved (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Ally ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26693609-ally", "userReview": "[cure for Kellis-Amberly (sp?) but those in power don't want to cure or do they?
