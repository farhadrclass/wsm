He was my first literary crush, and the first author who inspired me without exception. From my very first encounter with him at university, I was captivated by the lively, humorous intellectual giant, who could juggle the Enlightenment questions while being social, human, and incredibly funny. I sat in the attic of our university library, where the whole Encyclop\u00e9die was arranged and remained rather untouched for decades on end. And I read random articles penned by Diderot, and laughed with the ghosts of wit past. For I could not find any living person who put so much energy and charm into loving literature, justice and life. Had Diderot been a contemporary of ours, he would spread bliss on Goodreads, I am sure. And probably, he would be a Goodreads librarian as well, reviewing non-existent books for fun, hoping for stupid pseudo-erudite comments from flatterers (and I would be one of them, maybe!).For Diderot knew how to spread Fake News long before they made the real news and became an epidemic in the fake world of 2016. \u201cLa Religieuse\u201d came into being as a practical joke played on a friend, a fake story supported by fake letters. What a grandiose time Diderot and his friends must have had, coming up with the procedure to make a mutual friend engage in support of a fugitive nun, who had been forced into a monastery against her will. In the end, they were very sad to have to kill her off, as a meeting between the real friend and the literary heroine was imminent. Che drama!However, even though the text derives from a made-up story, and was created with the intention to play a trick on a friend, it would be entirely wrong to dismiss its message as a Don Quixotesque joke. For that is how Diderot got his message across: he disguised serious matters behind a curtain of silly adventures, exaggerations and inconsistencies. To be taken seriously, he made fun of the world. And that is what I find so incredibly compelling in him. My whole personality bows to the man who saw the injustice and idiocy of the world around him, but still found pleasure and amusement enough to be witty, not bitter.Certainly, the misery of monastery life and its social implications is exaggerated in \u201cLa Religieuse\u201d, or condensed to one story. For there were numerous cases of young girls forced by parents to become nuns, for social or pecuniary reasons. And there were trials that were lost. There were reports of cruelty and bullying, as well as sexual obsessions and abuse. Diderot collected the different experiences of monastery life and put them all together in the consecutive adventures of his protagonist in different monasteries. It is not very likely that one person would have experienced all of that, but all those abuses were common. The interesting argument in the short novel, however, is not the inhumanity of the inhabitants of monasteries, and their meaningless, shallow rituals, but the reason why the young woman doesn\u2019t want to stay there. She can\u2019t expect to have a life in splendor anywhere else either, in fact. She will have to work hard, subject to all kinds of insecurities, and male violence. But she insists that she can\u2019t be made to live in a monastery, for she is not suited for it: she wants her freedom, la libert\u00e9, and the monastery is a symbol for parental, religious and state dominance over individuals\u2019 natural inclinations and instincts. The story criticises four elements of French society:The State that lets religious institutions take over such a big share of decision making regarding the liberty of its citizensThe Church that provides a system in which it earns money by withdrawing young people from active, social lifeThe Society that provides a moral code which allows for punishment of illegitimate children rather than their parentsThe Catholic dogma that is inconsistent, confusing and outrageously evil in some respectsTo me, the most shocking part was reading the \u201charmless\u201d dialogues between the main character and different devout family members and nuns. I found it hard to understand that they actually believed they would \u201cmeet in heaven\u201d, - that they would \u201csit down and talk\u201d about the people they knew on Earth. When the protagonist is seriously ill, one of the nuns in her monastery laments that she is going to meet her favourite friend in heaven:\u201cAnd what is she going to tell her about me?\u201d Going to heaven to gossip about others? What?Or the unfaithful mother, who pushes her child into a monastery, so that she can redeem herself in heaven. Utterly bizarre. What kind of a deity is that, who would punish a (dead) sinner if the (living) offspring doesn\u2019t behave?\"Songez, mon enfant, que le sort de votre m\u00e8re, dans l'autre monde, d\u00e9pend beaucoup de la conduite que vous tiendrez dans celui-ci: Dieu, qui voit tout, m'appliquera, dans sa justice, tout le bien et tout le mal que vous ferez.\"Reading Diderot sharpened my eyes and ears in this area, and I was completely taken aback when my finishing of the book coincided with the sudden deaths of two celebrities, and the news that one of them had \u201cher stroke because she wanted to go and care for her deceased daughter\u201d. What kind of care does her daughter need, if she is in that obscure place called heaven? Bizarre rationalisations still very much alive among human beings who can\u2019t imagine that their influence on others will ever cease. That life is over when it\u2019s over. We still need to think that we are needed, that we can watch over the world and gossip about it, that we will meet again, in a strangely familiar setting (where?). Diderot pointed it out with stunning accuracy, when he reflected that people invoke gods and devils and heavens and hells according to their current needs, without logic:\u201cIl me paraissait assez singulier que la m\u00eame chose v\u00eent de Dieu ou du diable, selon qu'il leur plaisait de l'envisager. Il y a beaucoup de circonstances pareilles dans la religion; et ceux qui m'ont consol\u00e9e m'ont souvent dit de mes pens\u00e9es, les uns que c'\u00e9taient autant d'instigations de Satan, et les autres, autant d'inspirations de Dieu. Le m\u00eame mal vient, ou de Dieu qui nous \u00e9prouve, ou du diable qui nous tente.\u201dI strongly recommend reading \u201cLa Religieuse\u201d as the perfect case for personal freedom, against prejudice and patented dogma. We need Diderot\u2019s clear vision more than ever!But I will close with another favourite of mine, reflecting on the strange group of people who all aspire to a place in that heavenly, gossiping beehive.As Oscar Wilde said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to heaven. None of my friends are there!\u201d Just think about it! The Who\u2019s Who In Heaven is a scary read!"}, {"userName": "Lynne King", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king", "userReview": "\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to come to see me anymore?\u201d\u201cNo, dear Mother.\u201d\u201cAnd you won\u2019t let me come and see you in your cell anymore?\u201d\u201cNo, dear Mother.\u201d\u201cWill you refuse my caresses?\u201d\u201cIt will be very difficult for me to do so, for I was born affectionate and I like being caressed, but I must. I\u2019ve promised my confessor and I made a vow before the altar.\u201dLooking at the above, is that the normal conversation between a nun and her mother superior? Perhaps it was at that particular time?On that note, where do you possibly start with even attempting to write a review on any work by this exceptional 18th century French author and philosopher?Diderot has indeed excelled himself here. He was a leading literary figure and believed that people generally needed to socialize and he seemed to think it quite unhealthy that individuals could even contemplate withdrawing from society. So it seems to be at the opposite end of the spectrum that he would write this 1770 novella (posthumously published in 1796 \u2013 he evidently was never in a hurry to get his written works to the public) against a backdrop of girls, as young as fifteen, who were forced by their parents to take their perpetual vows for life in the claustrophobic atmosphere of the convents. In addition, what intrigued me more than anything about Diderot was that he was both an atheistic and a materialist, and yet he\u2019s written a religious book and a satire at that. And to think that this book started as a hoax on a good friend:\u201cI have learned, written as a hoax: the purpose was initially to lure Marc-Antoine-Nicholas Croismare, Marquis of Lasson, back to Paris. Following the death of his wife, Suzanne Davy de La Pailleterie (a relation of Alexandre Dumas), the Marquis quit Paris and stayed away for eight years, during which time he had taken interest in the real life case of Marguerite Delamarre, who had claimed that, like the narrator of The Nun Suzanne Simonin, she was forced to take her vows against her will. Diderot, along with his friends, decided to trick the Marquis into returning, and the letters, turned into the novel, were purported to be from Suzanne, appealing to the Marquis for help.\u201dUnfortunately this all backfired, as the Marquis was not to be lured back and the issuance of this book subsequently took a different turn in its retelling.In my naivety, I believed that nuns typified godliness, devoutness, modesty and kindness, amongst other things, but what do we have here in this remarkable work? Well nothing except nuns who are portrayed as conniving, murderous in thought, violent, lying and with a penchant for lesbian sexual pursuits. The contradictory aspect is that despite all of this, they are also very na\u00efve and emotionally/sexually vulnerable. I was amused nevertheless to see how licentious mother superiors could bring these impressionable young girls round to their way of thinking. Some form of religious hysteria I guess. I was disappointed nonetheless at the lack of bondage (that was sad) but at least I had the evidence of several pieces of rope to encourage me in this vague possibility.Sister Suzanne supposedly appears not to really understand (methinks that\u2019s highly unlikely) the tame advances (and are they tame \u2013 there\u2019s no leaping or bounding around with passion) made towards her by her new mother superior. Well it\u2019s all rather unfortunate for the nuns in the convent that a certain confessor gets involved in the act with our sister and then everything escalates completely out of control\u2026I found the use of the first person as the narrator a powerful tool for describing the plight of these unfortunate girls. Most had their own dowries to pay for their time spent in the convents (few ever left before the laws were changed) but we also have the all-pervading atmosphere of pre-revolutionary France where the King had the right to sign \u201clettres de cachet\u201d, whereupon an individual could be tossed into jail, or in this case, a convent without any recourse whatsoever. These letters \u201ccontained orders directly from the king, often to enforce arbitrary actions and judgments that could not be appealed.\u201dThis book set my thought processes reeling from one of comedy and laughter through to black humour and tragedy and when I finished the last page, I smiled and in fact I was even tempted to laugh out loud at Diderot\u2019s writing. Perhaps I was on the verge of hysteria. Weren\u2019t nuns supposed to suffer from hysteria?On one hand, there\u2019s the violence demonstrated by the nuns and mother superior towards the supposedly reserved and innocent Sister Suzanne, who, on the other hand, basically seems to enjoy most aspects of her lifestyle at the three convents she stays in even though she\u2019s going through the \u201cwars\u201d. On the surface she appears to remain mentally, not physically, untouched by everything that happens to her. Our sister is a survivor and I always have a very high regard for that type of individual, be it in life or in a novel such as this.And as for Suzanne\u2019s mother; could one really believe her story about her daughter\u2019s birth or was it all contrived?The letters written by \u201cthe likeable and ill-fated Sister Suzanne Saulier (known as Simonin in the story and in this correspondence)\u201d to the Marquis and his replies are edifying and then what does he do, but throw a spanner in the works. And the letters of Madame Madin all add spice to the tale.I don\u2019t know what it is that I find fascinating about nuns, monks and monasteries but I do. One of those mysteries of life I guess.On that final note, all I can say is that I adored this book and look forward to reading more books by this remarkable man."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "\u202dLa religieuse = Memoirs of a Nun, Denis Diderot\u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0627\u0644 1977 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0631\u0627\u0647\u0628\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u062f\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u0648\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u06af\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06af\u06cc\u0633 \u0622\u0642\u0627\u0633\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0647\u061b \u061f\u061b \u062c\u06cc\u0628\u06cc\u060c \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0648\u06cc - \u0642\u0631\u0646 18 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0631\u0627\u0647\u0628\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u062f\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u0648\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0642\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0635\u0646\u0639\u0648\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u062c\u0627\u0648\u06cc\u062f\u061b 1394\u061b \u062f\u0631 272 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u06cc\u06a9: 9786006182704\u061b \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627 \u0633\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u067e\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0632 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u06cc\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0646\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u060c \u062f\u0631 \u0648\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc\u067e\u062f\u06cc\u0627\u06cc \u0648\u0631\u0698\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u06cc \u0631\u0627\u062c\u0639 \u0628\u0647 \u0647\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0631\u06cc\u0648\u06cc\u0648\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0639\u0631\u0628\u06cc \u0648 \u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0633\u06cc \u06af\u0648\u062f\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u0632 \u0646\u06cc\u0632 \u0647\u0633\u062a. \u0627. \u0634\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646\u06cc"}, {"userName": "MJ Nicholls", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2386804-mj-nicholls", "userReview": "I\u2019m applying for positions of paid work at the moment (known as a \u201cjob\u201d\u2014so I\u2019m told), and after about a month of no replies I\u2019m about ready to sign up for the convent.

She has a knack for logic and no ear for vocation, so she is not able to find any justification for all the suffering and pious rules that govern her. In her fight for freedom she uses all the means of revolt there are: open protest, rigid obedience, lawsuit, relocation etc. Embracing her destiny is not a viable alternative and even an ungodly reader prays with her that it will not become one.The church\u2019s aberrations are rarely so vividly coloured as in the journey of this nun, who happens to find herself surrounded by odd habits of nunneries and can\u2019t make sense of them. Our habits and rituals may seem ridiculous to an outside observer, all the more so, when there is no reason behind them. She is as close to a spring of meaning as it gets and everything she encounters forces her to drink from it: old traditions, that must have some sense to have lasted for so long and to be so highly respected; the lives of fellow nuns that must be meaningful in some way. Nevertheless she finds none for herself and remains detached. There\u2019s no hidden, internal logic of such a closed system, just an obliviousness to the general laws of the world.Although this novel is an epitome of all the wrongdoings of religious institutions to a degree that it made me laugh, I still felt a bit cheated by the final twist; but in a most charming way there is.

At face value, this is a slim and straight-forward epistolary novel about a young woman who is forced into covenant life by her awful, self-absorbed parents, who then proceeds to stand firm to her ideals as she is antagonized by sadistic, power-hungry hypocrites and mentally disturbed sex fiends. While Diderot was very much an atheist, he does a praiseworthy turn here giving voice to a sincerely religious narrator that has no desire to live the claustrophobic and tedious life of a nun. Not so much an attack against religion as much as an attack on the socially constructed institution of religion, Diderot weaves subtle and sublime satire into his novel, making it not only a potent lashing of the people who misuse religion as a means of taking out their petty, insensible vengeance on the world, but also a melancholy cry of empathy for the men and women who find themselves trapped in the repressed, anti-physical hologram that is the lifestyle of the insanely devout. Bonus points for Diderot's generous characterizations of the complexities of gender roles waaay before there was any modern idea such as lesbianism...and that ending...oh that ending!

Separate him, isolate him, his character will go bad, a thousand ridiculous affects will invade his heart, extravagant thoughts will germinate in his brain, like thorns in an uncultivated land.Given the untimely arrival of our Arctic Vortex, it is fitting that The Nun shudders with a frozen despair. Bone chilling mornings are well suited for such guided tours of the dark side. Abandon your preconceptions of the Enlightenment and moral cautionary tales, Diderot's creation is terrifying. Apparently it was a practical joke used to trick a friend to return to Paris from the countryside. The novel takes the form of an escaped nun tracing her history in a lengthy letter about a series of convents, ones where the prevailing theme is obedience. One thinks of Martin Amis, \"give some someone absolute control over another and thoughts soon turn to torture.\" Forget Sade or Huysmans, I was scared shitless by the novel's second Mother Superior: think Martha Stewart as Torquemada."}, {"userName": "knig", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6163905-knig", "userReview": "This went down in one sitting: less a tribute to the literary merits of this novel and more an expose of my coarse, voyeuristic nature. Of the very base, chav chasing, track suit wearing, Vicky Pollard yeah but no but yeah variety where I settle my newly acquired Christmas overhang on the settee, spread out the fries and Baconnaise washed down with a spot of bitter shandy and munch my way through this epic saga of nuns being very, very naughty. In France. And, lets face it, nobody does naughty like the French (except maybe Berlusconi and the Bunga Bunga parties. Which I only know about through hearsay because I\u2019m no longer a minor and therefore was not invited). The picture I paint above is ofcourse, exactly the kind of parody I used to laugh over with my mates in college: the beached whale with the mills&boon tucked under one arm, and the tub of Hagendaaz in the other at the supermarket checkout, getting ready to spread her mutton-dressed as lamb buttmuch on the sofa for a Friday night staycation. Well, whose laughing now. Wait, that came out wrong, like a bad Bushism. I mean, except, I\u2019m not laughing anymore. Still, Diderot gives a lot more bang for my buck than Mills & Boon, so some mercies abound.So, theres a pubescent girl Suzanne who is thrown into a convent in 1758 in a process called \u2018coerced monachization\u2019 (no Diderot didn\u2019t use this phrase. No, I didn\u2019t come up with it either. No, it has nothing to do with monage, m\u00e9nage or any variation thereof. Some academic did to explain the fact that up to half of all patrician females (thats the nobility to you and me) were voluntarily-on-purpose left in these convents against their will). Once inside, Suzanne is subjected to all kinds of debauchery, torture, sexual harassment, incarceration, and basically any degrading acts you can think of. And some you can\u2019t. So, there I am, eating, reading, reading, eating, unable to stop, because I have GOT to know just how far that pesky mother Superior is going to take her \u2018dangerous liaison\u2019: we have a slow progression from holding hands, to kissing the eyelids, the neck, the shoulders (and orgasming fully clothed at this point which was surprising yet reminiscent of a Bikram kind of mind over matter way. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was offered as extra credit course somewhere: How to orgasm fully clothed and at arms length from the object of your affection).So, as all of this action (or inaction, depending on your point of view) was developing, I did get this slightly uncomfortable snapshotty feeling of reading this novel for all the wrong reasons: namely a vacuous mesmerisation (is that a word?) with this 18c French Big Brother reality show. The torture, the cruelty, the petty shenanigans of a bunch of sexually frustrated and extremely bored nuns. I say all the wrong reasons because the novel was/is meant to be so much more than raunchy tell all. Its actually a scathing indictment of a despicable practice of forcibly \u2018interring\u2019 superfluous daughters in perpetual oblivion within the walls of these positively heathenish convents. And once you were in, you were in. Breaking the vows was impossible. Que desolee.But I\u2019ll admit, thats not why I was reading it. I was reading it to see how bad those nuns could get."}, {"userName": "Rowena", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena", "userReview": "This is an interesting novella, written in the form of a letter, by a nun to someone she hopes will help her break the vows which she took by force.The young French girl, Suzanne, is a victim of circumstances, hated by her family through no fault of her own, and forced to enter a convent. She takes the orders against her wishes although she realizes she has no vocation.At the convent she falls into the bad books of the Mother Superior and is abused horrifically, sadistically even. Some of the methods the nuns used to abuse her were pretty shocking. The book is not an attack on Catholicism by any means; Suzanne never loses her faith despite her ordeals. What it is is an attack on the \u201cunnatural\u201d atmosphere of a cloister. It brings to the forefront the awful practice of forcing young girls into convents, often when they were as young as 15 (too young to really know what was going on). Truly, Diderot paints convent life in the most awful way. The convent conditions sound dreadful and don\u2019t seem to be conducive to growth or anything remotely positive. As Suzanne said, \"I have plenty of courage, but no courage in the world can hold out in the face of neglect, solitude and persecution.\"I think it was an interesting read for me as I had always assumed that convents wouldn\u2019t be such places of pettiness, and that relations between nuns would be civil at least. Alas, this was not the case in this book."}, {"userName": "K.D.

This novel was originally written as a joke! And a joke it should be read and enjoyed! La Religieuse (The Nun) is an 18th century French novel, by Denis Diderot. Completed in c. 1780, the work, however, wasn't published until 1796, after Diderot's death. Diderot wrote a letter to his retired companion Marquis de Croismare to entice him to retreat back to Paris. The letter was supposed to be from a nun incarcerated in a convent asking Croismare to save her. Many of Diderot's friends found the letters amusing so Diderot revised and made it into a novel. Suzanne was a 19-y/o girl who was the youngest in the family of 3 girls. Her mother had an affair with another man and although Suzanne grew up with her mother's real husband, she felt unloved. When she began to have admirers, her parents brought her to a convent to become a nun. In front of the altar when the priest asked if she wanted to be come a nun, she answered no. Her parents plead to her but she persisted. But they died. So, with nowhere else to go, she finally agreed. However, she still felt trapped and she started to create scenes in the convent. She was punished until a priest transferred her to another convent. In that other convent, she was molested by the Mother Superior. The plot is not funny. Rather, if it were true in the 18th century France (where most people are catholics), it could have created a scandal. Also, learning in the book's introduction that it was supposed to be a joke, I could not help but laugh in many scenes in it. My favorite is that part when after Suzanne was punished by the nuns, she prayed loud to God to forgive her tormentors. The Mother Superior said that she Suzanne compared herself to Jesus Christ and they (the nuns) as the Jews who crucified Him.However, it is also written in Wikipedia that Diderot had a nun sister who died in a French Catholic church from overwork. This was said to have changed his view on religion.Yesterday, I was in Fullybooked Rockwell with my father-in-law. We were celebrating Father's Day together with my family and his wife and our US-based visiting ninang. My father-in-law bought two non-fiction books worth P1,600+. One of them was about WWII and the other one is a book on humor (jokes). He said that he does not read fiction because they are just gawa-gawa ng tao. Unknown to him, I had already bought two books worth P900+: Pnin by my favorite Vladimir Nabokov and At-Swim Two Birds by Flann O'Brien. I retorted that fiction books may have been that but most of them have basis in real life. They are just made into fiction to be more interesting. Non-fiction could also be gawa-gawa so we cannot be sure if they are all true.Like The Nun. We know about those scandals inside the church. Like the valiant story of McArthur or the fake medals of President Marcos that were erroneously written in our history. That episode in Desperate Housewives was not funny at all. Some Filipino doctors in the US even marched on the streets demanding apology from Fox and the producers of the show.I seldom buy regular-priced books. For more than a year now, I have not been buying clothes except those given to me during holidays (Father's Day, my birthday and Christmas) by my family and friends. I have \"rainy days\" fund. However, I still know how to share and how to enjoy money to bring me happiness. Good friends and books (like The Nun) do make me happy."}, {"userName": "Joselito Honestly and Brilliantly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly", "userReview": "A novel about nun-and-nun lesbian love. In a broader context, about what happens when piety is imposed against one's free will. From his personal experience, Denis Diderot knew it is tragic. His own sister, forced into an Ursuline convent, lost her mind and died there, insane. He himself was once locked up in a monastery by his own father who had wanted him to become a priest. He escaped and instead married his Nanette.This is an 18th century novel and when it was written by this Frenchman Diderot one (1) in every 200 Frenchwomen was a nun. Young, beautiful French girls were being sent to convents against their will for all sorts of reasons (e.g., they're illegitimate, unmarried still and past the age of marrying, etc.). The country then remarkably had more nuns than monks: 5,000 convents with around 55,000 nuns compared to only 3,000 monasteries which were homes to around 30,000 monks. It would have been not much a problem had these nuns and monks been allowed to socialize or interact with each other but these were Catholic nuns and monks so celibacy and chastity were rigid rules--at least on paper. Through a character in the novel Diderot passionately lashes at this system, at these rash, forced and unnatural vows taken by these creatures of the flesh:\"Can these vows, which fly in the face of our natural inclinations, ever be properly observed by anyone other than a few abnormal creatures in whom the seeds of passion have withered and whom we should rightly consider as monsters, if the current state of our knowledge allow us to understand the internal structure of man as easily and as well as we understand his external form? Do all those doleful ceremonies that are performed at the taking of the habit and at the profession, when a man or woman is dedicated to the monastic life and to misfortune, actually suspend our animal instincts? On the contrary, are not those very instincts stirred up in the silence, constraint, and idleness, and with a violence unknown to people in the world outside who are swept along by a host of distractions? Where does one see minds obsessed by impure visions which haunt them and torment them? Where does one see that profound boredom, that pallor, and those skeletal forms which are all symptoms of nature languishing and wasting away? Where are the nights troubled by groans and days filled with tears shed needlessly and preceded by some mysterious melancholy? Where does nature, revolted by a constraint for which it is not intended, smash the obstacles put in its way, become enraged, and throw the whole animal system into incurable disarray? Where have spite and whim destroyed all social qualities? ...Where does man, considering himself but an ephemeral, transitory being, treat the sweetest relationships of this world with disinterest, as a traveller treats the things he comes across? Where is the dwelling place of coercion, disgust, and hysteria? Where is the home of servitude and despotism? Where is undying hatred? Where are the passions nurtured in silence? \"Indeed, where but in the whole of France was it that nuns kiss each other, mouth-to-mouth, tongues skirmishing, and attaching their country's very name to this delicious intimacy they have invented? Mother Superiors having orgasms while newly entered nuns, fresh and innocent, sat on their laps? Or one, after having touched and praised every part of a young nun's body, who would piously intone:\"No, it is the greatest joy that God has called her to the cloistered life; with a figure like that in the outside world she would have driven every man she set her eyes on to damnation, and she would have bee damned with them.

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59357-suvi", "userReview": "Diderot finished The Nun in 1760, but it wasn't published in book form until 1796, twelve years after Diderot's death. What's interesting about this is that the novel is based on a practical joke played on the Marquis de Croismare. The Marquis had stayed in Normandy for several years, when one day he received a letter, where a young nun asked help after having escaped from a convent. This \"nun\" was actually Diderot and his friends. The story was believable, because the letter was based on Marguerite Delamarre's case, in which de Croismare had been involved (details here). The joke failed, because the Marquis, instead of returning to Paris, offered the girl a sanctuary in Normandy, so naturally the girl had to be \"killed\". Surprisingly, after finding out the truth, the Marquis just laughed and didn't mind at all.Diderot then developed his novel from these letters. His sister went mad and died in a convent, and as one of the leading figures of the Enlightenment, a critic of religion, and a defender of women (or at least he was aware that they were treated as children), Diderot's stance on the convent system doesn't come as a surprise.Although, to be more specific, the novel deals with the practice of sending girls to convents against their will for various reasons (Delamarre was three when she began her convent life). Financial difficulties and too many mouths to feed? Off to the convent! Immoral behavior? Off to the convent! Difficult to gather up a dowry, so that your daughter can't get married? Off to the convent! In mid-18th century every 200th Frenchwoman was a nun, and there were double as many convents (5000) and nuns (55 000) than monasteries and monks.Suzanne, the protagonist, is genuinely religious, but she doesn't have a calling to be a nun. Her parents force her into a convent, because she's a consequence from her mother's affair, so her (step)father's and mother's hate and guilt lead to Suzanne feeling like she has a duty to move away from her family's, especially her siblings' who worry about their inheritance, range of vision. In short, she has way too much understanding toward her mother's situation.When Suzanne realizes the truth about convent life, it's already too late. She's forced to suffer from physical abuse and the childish bullying of the nuns and the Mother Superior. A Mother Superior, who brags about how she's able to turn the nuns into monsters at any given moment. It's distressing to read how Suzanne tries to escape her predicament by appealing to outsiders and by getting a lawyer, because the canon law had great weight in 18th century France. An individual, especially a girl, had very little power to decide about their own life. In real cases, the lawyers who appealed on behalf of their clients, drew attention to the women's passiveness, childlikeness, and their inability to make decisions. One case had a monk, and he was described with the same terms, so that he appeared more feminine and pathetic. The society simply considered those who wanted to get out of the convents hysterical and too keen on independence. The vow you made to God was binding, and if you tried to sever that tie, the society's family values were practically about to get destroyed (Convents and Nuns in Eighteenth-century French Politics and Culture by Mita Choudhury).When Suzanne switches convents, her inexperience once again leads to trouble with the Mother Superior, but this time just causes confusion in the girl's naive mind. Diderot addresses women's sexual frustration boldly but not scandalously, and Suzanne isn't unhappy because she lost her loved one, so The Nun isn't comparable to earlier semi-pornographic nun fantasies written by men. I admit thinking about Matthew Gregory Lewis's \nThe Monk\n (published in the same year) and The Devils (1971) when I first read the synopsis. The Nun, however, is vastly different, because suicidal nuns who tear their hair and go mad mostly just make you sad. There are many similarities with Delamarre's story, but you can find out yourselves what kind of an ending Suzanne has.So far probably the most accessible 18th century novel I've read, but still very thought-provoking and intelligent. Russell Goulbourne's translation is clear and fluent, and the Oxford World's Classics edition has a great introduction with the original letters printed in the appendix. Diderot's criticism of religion is sharp, but he avoids preaching, and instead focuses on Suzanne's thoughts and experiences. There were times when the story lagged quite a bit, because the plot is pretty nonexistent, but that's minor.\n\"But where's the danger in one woman's intimacy with and caresses for another woman?\"Dom Morel said nothing.\"Am I not just the same as I was when I came here?\"Dom Morel said nothing.\"Wouldn't I have carried on being the same? So where's the harm in loving one another, in saying so and in showing it? It's so pleasant!\""}, {"userName": "Lu\u00eds C.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34132356-lu-s-c", "userReview": "The Nun, tells the story of a testimonial, inspired Diderot by real events, of a young girl who will go into orders against her.Suzanne, to allow his mother to atone for his sin of adultery (and also to allow her two sisters to receive any inheritance from his parents) will end up in a convent.Despite herself, she pronounced the vows that will devote an entire life in a convent and devoted to prayer and other devotions.She will try to sue in order to break his vows. Unfortunately, we are still at a time when the Church and the State are not yet separated.Moreover, the fact that she wants to leave the monastic life stigmatizes the eyes of his peers and especially one of its ultimate parent.One can not help but be struck by the harshness of what happens to this girl, who though very pious, does not feel absolutely not made for that life.A small book that reads quickly, and although reflecting out of fashion manners, leaves a lasting impression ..."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "The Nun tells the story of a woman forced into convent life by her family.

Telling the sad story of a young woman forced into a convent, Diderot takes aim at organized religion and the social stigmas of his time. The violence, both physical and emotional, is brutal. And Diderot doesn't shy away from frank depictions of lesbianism. While on the surface the book is certainly aiming to shock, there's a lot going on beneath the surface, particularly a strong, feminist polemic that was centuries ahead of its time. Though certainly anti-religious, it's never anti-God, which I found refreshing. Yes, the ending does feel a bit rushed, and at times, the prose does get a bit dense. But it maintains strong momentum and characterization throughout. Von Trier's \"Dancer in the Dark\" came to mind a lot while reading this.

Il joue dans l\u2019\u00e9criture avec une libert\u00e9 admirable, toujours rempli de surprises, il aborde tout avec la m\u00eame l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9 triomphante.Il va de soi qu\u2019un individu de ce type est tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 saisir car sa libert\u00e9 l\u2019entra\u00eene toujours \u00e0 explorer de nouvelles possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019existences. Il a ainsi la r\u00e9putation d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 un mat\u00e9rialiste ath\u00e9e alors qu\u2019il me para\u00eet g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement plut\u00f4t comme un d\u00e9iste pr\u00e9romantique \u00e0 la Rousseau et qu\u2019il se montre ici comme un authentique chr\u00e9tien anti-cl\u00e9rical dans un \u00e9crit dont le bouillant Martin Luther lui-m\u00eame se serait probablement d\u00e9lect\u00e9. L\u2019institution cl\u00e9rical est en effet expos\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s r\u00e9aliste par Diderot dans La religieuse sans que la foi chr\u00e9tienne authentique y soit attaqu\u00e9e d\u2019aucune mani\u00e8re, bien au contraire. Tout le roman tient dans cette phrase : \u00ab Ah! Monsieur, si vous avez des enfants, apprenez par mon sort celui que vous leur pr\u00e9parez, si vous souffrez qu\u2019ils entrent en religion sans les marques de la vocation la plus forte et la plus d\u00e9cid\u00e9e. \u00bb(91) Du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin du roman, l\u2019institution cherchera \u00e0 s\u2019imposer \u00e0 la petite fille qui deviendra malgr\u00e9 elle s\u0153ur Sainte-Suzanne et cette derni\u00e8re r\u00e9sistera irr\u00e9ductiblement, car elle a besoin d\u2019exister librement. Elle r\u00e9sistera, bien que son c\u0153ur appartienne v\u00e9ritablement au Dieu chr\u00e9tien avec qui elle a une relation personnelle. C\u2019est m\u00eame dans les v\u00e9rit\u00e9s de cette religion qu\u2019elle trouvera le courage et les raisons de r\u00e9sister \u00e0 l\u2019institution :\u00ab Ce fut alors que je sentis la sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 de la religion chr\u00e9tienne sur toutes les religions du monde; quelle profonde sagesse il y avait dans ce que l\u2019aveugle philosophie appelle la folie de la croix. ... Je voyais l\u2019innocent, le flanc perc\u00e9, le front couronn\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9pines, les mains et les pieds perc\u00e9s de clous, et expirant dans les souffrances; et je me disais : \u00ab Voil\u00e0 mon Dieu, et j\u2019ose me plaindre!... \u00bb Je m\u2019attachai \u00e0 cette id\u00e9e, et je sentis la consolation rena\u00eetre dans mon c\u0153ur \u00bb.(99)Sur le plan de l\u2019\u00e9criture, j\u2019ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 le fait que Diderot fasse \u00e9crire ce roman par la religieuse elle-m\u00eame, et qu\u2019il la fasse interpeller fr\u00e9quemment son lecteur, \u00ab vous l\u2019avouerai-je, monsieur? \u00bb, \u00ab dont vous jugerez, monsieur, comme il vous plaira \u00bb, \u00ab sauf votre meilleur avis \u00bb, etc. Cela donne une tournure militante au roman. Il est vraiment dommage que Diderot se mette \u00e0 lui faire apostropher une personne pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 partir du milieu du roman (\u00ab Vous f\u00fbtes de ce nombre \u00bb(93)). \u00c9videmment, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une histoire vraie arriv\u00e9e dans le cercle de ses amis, mais il aurait pu donner une port\u00e9e universelle \u00e0 cette histoire particuli\u00e8re si il avait simplement su tenir le cap qu\u2019il a si bien tenu dans la premi\u00e8re partie du roman.Il arrive aussi assez souvent qu\u2019en cours de r\u00e9cit, la simplicit\u00e9 de ton de la religieuse laisse place \u00e0 un discours d\u2019une pr\u00e9cision philosophique qui ne colle absolument pas au personnage. Et comme la religieuse est elle-m\u00eame narratrice, il n\u2019est pas possible \u00e0 Diderot d\u2019intercaler un \u00ab dit-elle \u00e0 en termes plus simples \u00bb ou un \u00ab voil\u00e0, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, ce qu\u2019elle fit comprendre \u00e0 sa sup\u00e9rieure \u00bb pour bien faire passer ces incongruit\u00e9s d\u2019expression.Le roman comporte donc quelques d\u00e9fauts, mais ces d\u00e9fauts peuvent \u00eatre pardonn\u00e9s si on consid\u00e8re qu\u2019ils n\u2019existeraient pas si l\u2019excellence du reste ne les ferait pas remarquer. Et, peut-on exiger de la libert\u00e9 pure qu\u2019elle se conforme totalement \u00e0 la position qu\u2019elle s\u2019amuse \u00e0 prendre?"}, {"userName": "\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627

Questo torner\u00e0 a breve al cugino di questa persona."}], "description": "\u202dLa religieuse, Denis Diderot\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0631\u0627\u0647\u0628\u0647\u061b \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647: \u062f\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u0648\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0642\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0635\u0646\u0639\u0648\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u062c\u0627\u0648\u06cc\u062f\u061b 1394\u061b \u062f\u0631 272 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u06cc\u06a9: 9786006182704\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0648\u06cc - \u0642\u0631\u0646 18 \u0645", "title": "\u0631\u0627\u0647\u0628\u0647", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35921039", "average": 3.69, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1512809828l/35921039.jpg", "reviews": 249, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11004.Denis_Diderot", "name": "Denis Diderot"}], "type": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Cultural", "European Literature", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35921039", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194005.La_Religieuse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18216.The_Nun", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5912068-the-nun", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/677904.The_Nun", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17979875", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13247124", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12756356-the-nun", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17950683-la-religiosa", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12975616-the-nun", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13122193-la-monaca", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18212.Jacques_the_Fatalist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18217.Rameau_s_Nephew_D_Alembert_s_Dream", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1925552.Le_neveu_de_Rameau", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1423513.Suppl_ment_au_Voyage_de_Bougainville", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1423538.Paradoxe_sur_le_com_dien", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
