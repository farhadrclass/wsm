The girls participate in a game, called \u201cThe Lying Game,\u201d which isolates their classmates and causes local townies to hate them.There are 5 rules to the game: TELL A LIE, STICK TO YOUR STORY, DON'T GET CAUGHT, NEVER LIE TO EACH OTHER, KNOW WHEN TO STOP LYING.After a horrible event occurs leading to the expulsion of the liars, the game ends but the girls never stop lying. They make a pact to never share what really happened, and keep the secret buried for 17 years.Switch to the present, and Isa is a 32 year old attorney living in London with her newborn daughter, Freya, and partner, Owen. She\u2019s lost contact with the other girls, but when she receives a text from Kate simply stating, \u201cI need you,\u201d she drops everything and runs to her friend\u2019s side. Kate, Isa, Thea and Fatima reunite, desperate to keep their secret under wraps. It soon becomes apparent that one of them has broken perhaps the most pivotal rule: NEVER LIE TO EACH OTHER.Told from Isa\u2019s perspective, the narrative switches back and forth between the past and present. Isa shares a lot about how things used to be, and while the narrative shifts to the past we only get small glimpses of the friends time together, which hindered my ability to really get a full picture of their friendship. This is one of the reasons I had trouble with this book. I also found Isa\u2019s voice stifling.The Lying Game isn\u2019t bad, it\u2019s just not great. While it's very well-written, there was something lacking for me. Often, I was bored--but this might be because I figured out the mystery super early on. I received a copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "Four high school friends now in their thirties reunite after a terrible shared secret threatens to emerge and shatter their peaceful lives. But what they thought was a shared secret turns out to be a lie - one of them isn\u2019t telling the truth. I really enjoyed Ruth Ware\u2019s debut novel, In a Dark, Dark Wood, and was disappointed with the poor follow-up, last year\u2019s The Woman in Cabin 10, so I hoped The Lying Game would be a return to form; it\u2019s not. The Lying Game is awful - looks like Ruth Ware is a one-hit wonder! This non-thriller horribly takes its time, ambling towards the reveal of the mystery at the novel\u2019s core, along the way introducing us to its cast of uninteresting nobodies in a small, dreary coastal town. The \u201cdark secret\u201d is underwhelming to say the least, particularly as it\u2019s built up to be something utterly shocking. I guess what they did is morally questionable but I thought it was going to be much, much worse than it was. Things don\u2019t improve in the second half of the book. Ware wastes more time on the impossibly mundane life of Isa, our narrator, who has boring quarrels with her husband - this, like too many passages clogging the narrative (what did having a baby add exactly?), has NOTHING to do with ANYTHING, I just kept thinking GET THE FUCK ON WITH IT! - as the pathetic \u201cplot\u201d shuffles towards a dull final twist that I couldn\u2019t have cared less about at that point, and then the whole disaster is wrapped up. It\u2019s never really clear what exactly the point was. The four friends gather and talk about what they did but don\u2019t really do anything further - it\u2019s not just a lack of any character\u2019s discernible motivation, it\u2019s a total absence of direction which only accentuates the turgid pacing of the book. A menacing figure, Luc, is introduced but other than wondering whether or not he killed a sheep (another go-nowhere subplot), it\u2019s not clear at all what his purpose is - his presence only makes sense with the final twist so up til then he feels like another superfluous addition to this overlong novel. The mystery itself is flimsy at best. It was only a mystery to us because the details are slowly parcelled out - if it was revealed at once you\u2019d be able to poke holes in its flawed construction, as the main character does once she begins to think about it. But why wouldn\u2019t she have thought about it at the time or at any time in the 16 or so years since it happened!? It\u2019s such contrived drivel. No aspect of The Lying Game was interesting or worth reading. It was a supremely tedious, unremarkable and unsatisfying novel that\u2019s put me off of picking up anything by Ruth Ware in the future. I highly recommend her only good novel, In a Dark, Dark Wood, which is exciting and fun, though I\u2019d steer well clear of her other books."}, {"userName": "Navidad Thelamour", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50404233-navidad-thelamour", "userReview": "\u201c\u2026years on, people round here still use your names as a kind of salacious cautionary tale\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s rare that I stumble upon a read as gripping and as raw as this one was. And, it was not an outright or vulgar kind of raw\u2014no, that wouldn\u2019t really be the English way, now would it?\u2014but Ruth Ware\u2019s The Lying Game was something arguably so much better, because it didn\u2019t lean on outright shock, melodrama and over-the-top confrontations. No, here the rawness is in the imagery, a true reader\u2019s delight, because it pulled at the senses and plucked at our moral strings in unpredictable ways, in ways that were altogether unexpected when I picked up this novel.Here, the reader will peep behind the closed doors of a partially secluded English home at the edge of a reach, a place where the water laps at the very door of the home in high tide just as danger and uncertainty laps at their feet from the moment they receive Kate\u2019s SOS text: I need you. Once a place of refuge and harbor, the Reach has turned into a silent stomping ground for their greatest fears and will forever be a magnet of both dread and longing for each of the women in this sisterhood. Kate, Thea, Fatima and Isa share a secret that bonds them together tighter than blood ever could. And it starts and ends with the Reach. The gentle suspense here was wonderful, but even it was heightened and magnified like a fly under a magnifying glass by the camaraderie that held these four unlikely friends together nearly 20 years after that fateful night\u2014you could feel their anxieties, mistrust and the burn of their lies scorching your very skin as you read on. Ware swirled so much unexpected goodness into these pages that I was amazed at her deftness and insight. This glimpse into their world was so much more than just that\u2014it was the peeling back of the layers of humanity within ourselves and at the lengths that we will go to protect one of our own. The very act of peeling seemed to be almost a metaphorical foundation: the peeling away of clothes wet from the waters of the Reach, of skin around ragged fingernails chewed nearly to the quick, of secrets from the truth they\u2019d all stood on as their foundation for years. And, too, within these pages you\u2019ll find other hidden nuggets, like a subtle commentary on the cultural insensitivity Muslims face every day (\u201cWhat do you think it means? If you think it means that she\u2019s using that head scarf as a bandage, then yes, that\u2019s what I mean. It\u2019s great that Allah\u2019s forgiven you\u2026but I doubt the police will take that as a plea bargain.\u201d) the bond of family\u2014blood and otherwise\u2014and a true sense of setting and surroundings: It gives the whole place a melancholy air, like those sultry southern American towns, where the Spanish moss hangs thick from the trees, swaying in the wind. The town of Salten was embedded in true English culture, making the characters all leap to life on the pages, the values of this tight-knit society playing an important role in the unfolding of events. The Lying Game managed to be about so much more than lying\u2014though those moments of actual \u201cgame play\u201d were delightful, fun, frisky and filled with all of the carefreeness of youth that we all remember, that we all yearn to hold on to even now. It was also about the grip of a parent\u2019s love and protection of their children, small town scandal and the whisper of child sexual abuse.How dare you judge me? I do what I have to do to sleep at night. So do you, apparently. How about you respect my coping mechanisms and I\u2019ll respect yours?Ruth Ware gave her readers a phenomenal roller coaster of twists and turns. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would be happy to read more from this author any day! The setting was palpable, the sisterhood and kinship of these women SO relatable. These women felt real; their faults and growth felt real and it made me want to follow them throughout these 300+ pages. The camaraderie was palpable, lifelike, believable and touching. There was no bow-tie happy ending here and I respected that, yearned for that, in fact. Ware had the guts to not put a ribbon on it for us, and her readers can only revere her for that. I loved every moment of reading this novel and I'm definitely a Ruth Ware fan from here on out. The Lying Game easily earned itself a very strong 4 stars. ****(I've downgraded this review from a 5* to a very strong 4* read, because the 5* nagged at me. I reserve that for the absolutely breath-taking works of writing, and this was not quite that, though it was exceptionally well done!)**I received an advance-read copy of this book from the publisher, Gallery/Scout Press, via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.**The Navi Review | Twitter | Bookstagram"}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "This is an atmospheric and eerie psychological thriller from Ruth Ware. Take four teenage schoolfriends who set up a group that vies to create the most outlandish lies that they can get others to believe, and what you have is a recipe for potentially horrifying outcomes. This is exactly what the author does, creating two time lines when something terrible happens that results in the four girls being expelled from their school, although this does not stop them from lying. Their one proviso is that they must tell the truth to one another, however, when you specialise in lying, that may be a bit of a tall order. In the present, the four friends have not seen each other in years. Isa is now a 32 year old lawyer, with a partner, Owen, and baby daughter, Freya, she is a woman with everything to lose. She gets a text from Kate saying that she needs her. The narrative is delivered from Isa's perspective, filling us in on their past and what is now happening in the present.Isa rushes to Kate, and they are joined by Thea and Fatima, they are tense and disturbed at the possibility that the secret that they have kept for seventeen years is about to emerge. We are slowly taken back to their schooldays at Salten, a boarding school. We see their relationships build, and how their group was set up. Their Lying Game, which seemed so much fun at the time, creates divisions and isolates others, and the locals are none too happy either. Then the awful event occurs and they lie their way through that. Are their secrets from the past now set to emerge? This is a beautifully written novel with both suspense and twists. However, whilst we do get a clear idea of the characters of Kate and Isa, we are left more in the dark about Thea and Fatima, which is a shame. A great read that focuses on the issues of love, deception, trust and relationships. However, whilst I derived enjoyment from reading it, it did have too many strong echoes of her book, In a Dark Dark Wood. I hope the author does not keep repeating the same motifs in her future books and finds new territory to explore.

The main character, Isa Wilde, who narrates this story has a six-month-old baby daughter named Freya who we both absolutely loved and felt that she definitely stole the show for us! \u00a0We were both in awe of how well RUTH WARE described in complete perfection the bond between a mother and her newborn child. \u00a0These were very touching aspects of the novel and pulled at our heartstrings!While Lindsay was reading this book, it brought back a lot of memories for her of those sleep-deprived nights and the fond feelings of being a new mother. She could really relate to Isa in so many ways as far as motherhood goes. \u00a0We both really enjoyed the setting in this one, the game, all the drama within, and the strong connection that we felt to Isa was one of the main reasons that we both loved this book so much! \u00a0Would recommend! \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All of our Traveling Sister Reads Reviews can be found on our blog:http://www.twogirlslostinacouleereadi..."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "The Lying Game by Ruth Ware is a 2017 Gallery Scout publication. This latest thriller, by Ruth Ware, is an all- consuming, riveting tale, full of mind games and edgy suspense. Isabel, Kate, Fatima, and Thea became fast friends while attending Salten boarding school, as teenagers. They began \u2018the lying game\u2019 to liven up their stay at the school, garnering them a terrible reputation on campus. But, ironically, their practice of lying came in handy, when they found themselves involved in a scandal that forced them out of the school. Now, as adults, the women have moved on with their lives the best way they can, but they all live in fear of the day they will be summoned back to Salten to answer for their crimes. That day has finally arrived. Isabel, Fatima and Thea all receive a text message from Kate-\u2018I need you.\u2019This story is moody and atmospheric, with a heavy feeling of foreboding percolating in the background. Ware had me on edge right from the start and kept me there until I crossed the finish line. The consequences of lying are numerous, and we all know that lies cultivate more lies. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. But, it\u2019s especially brutal for Isabel, Kate, Thea, and Fatima, who have all lived with their lies, precariously balanced on a precipice, knowing their dark secret could be discovered at any moment. When it looks like their worst fears are about to be realized, it forces them to polish up their lying skills once again\u2026 only this time, it\u2019s not a game. \u2018When you define yourself by walls, who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out. The people on the other side of the wall become, not just them, but THEM. The outsiders. The opposition. The enemy.\u2019Isabel is the narrator of this story, and gives an accounting of the girl\u2019s pasts, and the events of the present that brought them back together after all these years.\u201cWhat am I coming to? I am as bad as Kate, haunted by ghosts of the past. But, I remember lying here, one night, long ago, and I have that feeling again, of the record skipping in its groove, tracing and retracing the same voices and tracks.\u201dWith her stable home life at stake, Isabel has a great deal to lose if the truth were ever exposed. But, all the characters are complex and flawed, nervous, and jumpy, and under an equal amount of pressure. But, with their reputations preceding them, it is impossible to completely trust any of them.\u201cA wall, after all, isn\u2019t just about keeping others out. It can also be for trapping people inside.\u2019I enjoyed the setting in this one, the guessing game, the dramas, confessions, and the surprising twists, all of which are important for any psychological thriller, but this book almost has a Gothic undertone, which of course, I found very appealing.The suspense is mostly derived from the foreshadowing of doom, and is much more psychological than thriller, if that makes sense. Ware\u2019s style, after only two novels, won her the moniker of \u2018the Agatha Christie of our time\u2019, but, this one may seem like a kinder, gentler version of Ware, who seems to have altered her style of writing just a little bit with this one. This one is not quite as gritty as her previous novels have been, but I liked the more in -depth characterizations and the clever way she creates long lasting suspense that hangs in the air like a mist that refuses to burn off, becoming murkier and more intense as the story proceeds. But, never fear, there are still lots of surprises and twists that will catch you off guard. Overall, this is another very solid performance from Ware, and I enjoyed this one, especially appreciating the tone, which is very much the style of suspense I enjoy most. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "j e w e l s [Books Bejeweled]", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68216634-j-e-w-e-l-s-books-bejeweled", "userReview": "I'm now caught up on all of Ruth Ware's books! She is one of my favorite writers, yet I'm still waiting to give one of her books a five star rating. That's how talented she is as a writer, I'm willing to overlook her product output in favor of the gorgeous technical skill she possesses.The plot of THE LYING GAME is the weakest of Ware's three books. I was frequently bored and zoning out during the book, it really took me awhile to finish it and then, meh...not much more than a beautiful rewrite of Pretty Little Liars in a British accent. Ware is a master at creating atmosphere, mood and an overall foreboding tone to her mysteries.

The Lying Game was a mixed bag for me, but on balance I quite liked it. It's told from Isa's perspective. Isa is now in her early thirties with a young baby. She and two others get a text from high school friend Kate -- \"I need you\" -- and this sends Isa and her three friends into a tailspin back to the village where they went to boarding school when they were 15 years old. The less said the better because in large part the point of this story is how it unfolds. As a narrator, Isa is slow to let the reader know about what happened at school when she was 15 that has left such an emotional scar, and then Isa comes to find out that she doesn't have all the pieces of the puzzle. There's something dark, breathless and melodramatic -- almost gothic -- about how Isa tells her story that pervades the whole book. I wavered between finding the tone immature and just going along with it. At the end of the day, what I liked was that for this kind of quasi thriller, the story seemed original. I didn't know where it was going, and it was relatively morally complex. I cringed at many of the decisions Isa and her friends made at 15 and that Isa makes in her early 30s, but I couldn't stop looking because she had me hooked and I wanted to see what happens next. You wouldn't want to read The Lying Game looking for characters to like or side with. But you might want to read it if you're looking for an entertaining read that doesn't follow what have become some of the usual storylines. But definitely don't read it if you're not into dark melodrama.

At first I enjoyed it more, but as the story went on and as I thought of it in terms of other stellar mysteries I\u2019ve read as of late, it was obvious how flat this one fell in comparison.

In the aftermath, an urgent text goes out from one woman to her three friends, saying only: \"I need you.\" And they come running.Kate, Thea, Fatima and Isa first met at Salten House, a boarding school for girls, when they were fifteen. Kate and Thea had created a 'lying game' with rules and points and all four girls played along: Rule 1: Tell a lie.Rule 2: Stick to your storyRule 3. Don't get caught.Rule 4. Never lie to each other.Rule 5. Know when to stop lying.Of course, they earned the reputation as liars--in school and in the town. Who would believe anything they said? Kate's father, Ambrose Atagon, was a celebrated local artist who painted coastal landscapes and wildlife and taught art at the school. On weekends, he welcomed the girls to his home where they swam in the sea and were often the subjects of his drawings. His stepson Luc became inseparable with the girls. Then one night, Ambrose disappeared and embarrassing drawings of the girls reached the hands of the school administrators. To avoid a scandal, the girls and their families agreed for them to leave Salten behind. For seventeen years, they kept a secret between the four of them but now it looks like their lies and deception may be coming to light. A character-driven psychological thriller told from Isa's point of view, the story unfolds slowly, as Isa remembers the past and deals with problems in the present. The story picks up the pace in the final quarter as the women face the truth of what really happened so many years ago. Satisfying ending. So different from The Woman in Cabin 10! I think Ruth Ware's writing skill has grown beyond her previous work and here she has delivered a thriller with more depth.

Last year was all about The Woman in Cabin 10, which blurbs compared to Gone Girl and I\u2019m sorry, but NO. I digress\u2026.finding The Woman in Cabin 10 a decent enough read, I was looking forward to seeing what Ms. Ware had up her sleeve next. I didn\u2019t need another blockbuster novel, and in fact, preferred the follow-up to be quieter, but perhaps more finely tuned. I acknowledge that writers must be under immense pressure when penning their first story after a runaway hit. I get it. And The Lying Game sounded promising. After human remains are discovered, a group of women are summoned to their former stomping grounds by a mysterious message, hurriedly scribbled by the fourth member of their formerly tight quartet. A quartet that used to engage in The Lying Game, an innocent boarding school pastime that eventually leads to the group\u2019s expulsion and sudden death of the school\u2019s art teacher. Juicy, right??!! WRONG.With all the pieces in place: interesting premise, good writer, you might think: how could this book fail? But oh how it did. While Ruth Ware\u2019s writing itself remains lovely, The Lying Game might be one of the dullest stories I\u2019ve ever read.  AND IT\u2019S A MYSTERY. The primary issue is the book\u2019s entirely too long. It\u2019s bogged down with so much flowery prose and extraneous information that entire sections of the narrative read as pointless AT BEST. And with all that needless hoo-ha, \u201cTHE BIG SECRET\u201d the women are keeping, and the narrative\u2019s main drive, get lost.  They disappear in endless soliloquies about Salten\u2019s (the village) pastoral scenery (believe me, once you\u2019ve read one such passage, you\u2019ve read them ALL).  And then follows the pages upon pages of school-day reminiscing, which yes this is partly a reunion story, but these women are allegedly in imminent danger. WHY AREN\u2019T THEY SCARED? WHY AREN\u2019T THEY PUTTING TOGETHER AN ACTION PLAN? Why aren\u2019t they doing ANYTHING really other than getting drunk & acting ridiculously? DO THEY NOT KNOW THE RULES OF HORROR MOVIES??? How about postponing the girls\u2019 weekend until AFTER you vanquish the psycho killer? The characters are similarly frustrating. The only person who\u2019s at all developed is our protagonist, Isa. The remaining three women are one-dimensional tropes of the jock, cheerleader, bad girl variety.  The women are reduced to personality TYPES rather than fully realized individuals. And in a story that\u2019s supposedly character-driven, having few players to identify with or become interested in decreases overall reader investment.  I'm not saying let's transform this novel into a James Patterson-esque thriller (please for the love of literature, don't). But a balance between actual mystery and pointless description needs to be struck  (think: Tana French, Kate Atkinson, Denise Mina). The book reads more like a very tedious drama than a mystery and the characters are boring, which begs the questions WHY AM I READING THIS?Thanks to Netgalley and the publishers for a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31923026-laura", "userReview": "I think of all the lies I have repeated and repeated over the years, until they became so engrained they felt like the truth: I left because I wanted a change. I don\u2019t know what happened to him; he just disappeared. I did nothing wrong.\nCan you imagine something you did as a teenager coming back to haunt you seventeen years later? You even stopped hanging out with your best friends, but all it takes is a text, I need you, to drag you back in.Four girls (Isa, Kate, Fatima, & Thea) became friends at Salten House, a coastal boarding school. The girls bond over The Lying Game, a game they made up with a point system where they tell all sorts of lies to fellow students and faculty. The only rules are: tell a lie, stick to your story, don't get caught, never lie to each other, and know when to stop lying. Some lies were harmless enough, while others had real consequences. The girls get expelled in their final year of school around the same time Kate's father, the art master, goes missing.That\u2019s the trouble with having a \u201cclick\u201d as Mary Wren might call it. When you define yourself by walls, who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out. The people on the other side of the wall become, not just them, but them. The outsiders. The opposition. The enemy.The story is told from Isa's perspective and switches back and forth in time between present day & the past. We're told how cliquey the girls were, but it feels like mere glimpses into the girls' friendship back then. I feel like I was only being told by other characters what it was like around the girls or to be victim of their game. There wasn't much showing. In present day, Isa has new baby Freya who takes up a lot of her thoughts. This doesn't prevent her from dropping everything to take Freya with her to Kate's the second she receives the text. Is a seventeen year lie going to coming back to haunt them?There is so much I was dying to know. What did the girls do 17 years ago? What happened to Ambrose, the art master? Why does Kate need the others now?\nI had no idea the part that Ambrose would play in our lives, and we in his, or how the ripples of our meeting would go on reverberating down the years.\n The Lying Game is more of a character-driven mystery than Ruth Ware's previous novels. It is oozing in characterization. The setting is brilliant for the story - atmospheric and tense. The steady decay and sinking of the Tide Mill felt metaphorical for the girls' friendship. The marshes the girls would cross to get to Kate's house I could feel myself walking through. While this is a slow-burn mystery, at times it feels much too slow. I would've liked more on the friendship when the girls were younger. I feel like there was a bit more potential in Thea..and Fatima for that matter. They felt underwritten. I even have certain things I'm still wondering regarding Thea and her secrets. The mystery started out compelling, but became clear at a certain point. It just wasn't quite as mysterious.I did like this one overall.  Ruth Ware's writing is strong. It was nice to see something a bit different from her. I still prefer her first novel,  In a Dark, Dark Wood. It's interesting how both explored an old friendship since left behind but felt like very different books. Not by any means a bad thing.

I was a bit disappointed in \u201cThe Lying Game\u201d. While the novel is well written I really didn\u2019t feel that great \u201ctense, exciting\u201d feel of a thriller until perhaps the very last 30 pages. I also didn\u2019t particularly care for the characters in this book. This was really more like a 3.5 for me.A simple text \u201cI need you\u201d is sent from Kate sent to her three best friends from boarding school, Isa, Fatima and Thea. Within 24 hours each of the three have left their jobs, husbands, kids and rushed to Kate\u2019s side, quite a feat considering all of their involvements. The three young women had been close friends in boarding school, so much so that many of the other students steered clear of them. They were notorious for playing \u201cThe Lying Game\u201d, quite simply a test of how each of them could come up with an outlandish lie and then convince as many people as they could that it was true. They usually bailed on the game if things looked like they would be discovered by those in charge. The number one rule of the game however is that they never lie to each other.During the next few hundred pages we follow what happens as the young women rejoin their friend Kate at her home in a coastal village with a great estuary called \u201cThe Reach\u201d; the boarding school is located within walking distance of Kate\u2019s home. Something has happened, something discovered on the beach, and now the four are fearful of being found out for a disastrous lie that they told to cover up an event that happened 17 years ago.The four young women are fairly well developed and we find out the most about Isa as she is the narrator of the story. There are other notable characters, in particular, Luc who is Kate\u2019s half brother and a key player in their story. Why is he here when they all believed that he was still in France?? When he confronts Kate in the village he is barely recognizable as the young man that she spent so much time with in her youth, \u201cLuc is not that boy anymore. He is a man, and an angry one. And I am one of the people he is angry with\u201d. He is furious when he sees her and she has so many unanswered questions. What really has been taking place in the 17 years since they were together. I wish that I had gotten to know a bit more about Fatima and Thea as they sounded like interesting and unique charaters.Ambrose was the girls art teacher at school and is also Kate\u2019s father. How, why and where did he disappear to when things started to come apart for him at the school? What really went on during all of the weekends that the girls spent at Kate\u2019s house? Why were they all expelled from school mid semester?I checked my Kindle location and I know that I really started enjoying this book at around 70% through. The tension was ratcheted up, we all know that we are getting close to the answers to all of the questions scattered through the book. I think for me there was a lull in the middle of the book but it was worth continuing for the ending is very good and for me it was quite a shock.I really enjoy Ms. Ware\u2019s writing and I will always look forward to her next book!I received an ARC of this book through the publisher and Edelweiss, thank you."}, {"userName": "Roman Clodia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia", "userReview": "If you've read Ware's In a Dark, Dark Wood, then you'll recognise that the essence of the plot here is exactly the same: a group of girls were once close friends, something horrible happened, they went their separate ways and are brought back together again 17 years later; the horrible thing resurfaces, the truth is uncovered. Once again, too, we're in an unusual location, here a dilapidated mill which is sinking under the encroachment of water. What this book lacks, though, that the first one did so well, is characters with individual voices and a sense of humour. With those qualities lacking, this turns into a generic melodrama that lacks credibility. This supposedly tight-knit group turn out to have known each other for less than a year (they're 15 when they meet, haven't turned 16 when the horrible thing happens and they're separated, and despite not having seen each other for 17 years, when one of them texts the others they instantly drop London jobs, family, life to meet up - heck, my friends can't even co-ordinate drinks in the pub without military-style planning! Add to that a boring narrator obsessed with how many times a day she has to breast-feed her screaming baby (surely important in real life, duller than dull to read about), characters who are thin stereotypes (the artistic one, the Muslim one, the anorexic one), a plot involving sinister locals and a desperate last-minute 'twist'. It's a shame as Ware writes more fluently than many commercial authors in this genre but it seems that here she's just re-writing her first success without the elements which made it work: 2.5 stars for a fast, commute read which I was glad to finish."}, {"userName": "G.H.

But what have they lied about in the past and what is this mysterious summoning that reunites them? That is the central mystery of The Lying Game that gets played out over 400 pages. The Good: The start of the book with the summoning is great. It's followed by the friends reuniting, ala the old friends reuniting in The Big Chill and Last Vegas. The characters are drawn as distinct from one another, the racier ones egging on the less racy. The game they've created about lying is a good conceit. And the twists and turns revealed at the end of the novel are clever. The Less Than Good: Ruth Ware is clearly a talented writer. The Woman in Cabin 10 (minus the first 70 pages) is a terrific novel. Her writing style and character portrayals are winners again in The Lying Game. What is less than scintillating is the plot in the middle of the book. We certainly expect four people coming together to reminisce and enjoy their reuniting. But so many of the middle chapters are one-idea chapters that don't often relate to the plot. It's as if the plot takes a backseat to the women playing subtle mind games or having conversations that don't really lead anywhere. There's one chapter about whether or not the narrator should smoke a cigarette. Another chapter about whether or not to skinny dip. Obviously, there's character interaction and growing pains but the chapters, to me at least, are kind of one-off ideas of the women just spending time together as if there wasn't an emergency that brought them together. Throughout the middle, the women are haunted by an unexplained past, which is Ware's attempt to keep some dramatic tension where there really is very little; there's more character study than plot. Toward the end of the novel, the plot picks back up and the secret is revealed as are some unexpected twists in the story. I enjoyed the beginning and end of the novel and not a lot in between. The publishing house spins this novel as a \"slow burner.\" The novel is definitely a crock pot. For many, this will not be a problem. I'm too plot oriented to sit still when the plot is put on the back burner. That's just me.

The Lying Game was no exception to this. She does suspense well and keeps me up far too late reading because I NEED to know the outcomes. I don't go to Ware's books for mindblowing mysteries because that's just not her strength, and again, The Lying Game was true to that. It's definitely the quietest and most straightforward of her mysteries.This book met my expectations and delivered what I wanted, but it is still my least favorite of her books so far because the structure I had loved about Woman in Cabin 10 and In A Dark, Dark Wood was lacking in this. Instead of teasing where the story would go, this went the route of standard flashbacks.The plot itself was fairly predictable, or even if you don't see everything coming, it's at least unsurprising. Ware's writing is very atmospheric and she's captured 3 distinct settings that make you feel trapped in SO well in her books, but I was seeing too many similarities in her characters.

I'd almost forgotten how they feel on my tongue, slick and sickening.\u201d\u2015 Ruth Ware, The Lying Game 3.5 starsI am quite torn between giving this three or four stars (Goodreads- when are you going to give us our half stars?!) The first half of book was a real slog for me and I contemplated just abandoning it altogether. But suddenly it picked up pace and became interesting. The story is told from Isa's point of view, as she is called on by an old group of friends, with whom she has had no contact for fifteen years. She returns to the town where she went to school as an adolescent and met three other girls - Fatima, Thea and Kate. It is quickly clear that they share some big secret, and though I was intrigued by this, the slow pace and the characters, with whom I struggled to connect, made me almost give up on it. The title comes form a game the group played as teens, and it is evident that it has stretched into their adult lives as well. They are all keeping secrets and something that happened in their past is forcing them all to be liars still. While the ending and last third of the book picked up pace and grabbed my attention, I was not wholly surprised by the resolution. This sounds as if I have only bad things to say about the book, but it was just so hyped up that I was expecting something magnificent. It was not a bad book, and Ruth Ware is a good writer, I was simply a little disappointed. Also, I should mention, I listened to the audiobook and this may have made me dislike Isa more than was warranted, because the narrator has a very nasal, whiny voice and reads everything with an air of great gloom. This served to build an atmosphere, but after a while, it became irritating, because I felt nothing much was happening and the heightened sense of dread was unwarranted.Anyway... not my favorite by this author, though ultimately not a book I regret having read either.

I say it that way because, this story is told in a very different tone and manner than Ware's last two works so you might be caught off guard. \nThe Lying Game\n starts off with Isa Wilde and her family, where she receives a text from her friend Kate - \"I need you.\" - Immediately, Isa packs up and heads back to Salten, a boarding school set by the English Channel, where Kate resides by. June meets up with Kate and her other high school best friends Fatima and Thea to uncover mysteries surrounding their time at Salten, and reveal the truths about the effects of their dangerous game that they played; the lying game. As the story unfolds, the reader learns a lot about each character without it going too deep into non-relevant characterizations. The best part about this book is the feeling of girl power that I got while reading. I think it'll serve a nice purpose in that aspect. \nThe Lying Game\n is more of a teen drama than a thriller or mystery to me and it was too much of a slow burn for me to actually enjoy that much. It's not to say that you won't enjoy it, because I can tend to be stuck in my own mindset of what I enjoy with books. Ruth Ware's writing is one of the many reasons why she can slap me in the face, and I'd keep coming back for more. I will be back for the next Ruth Ware novel!"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32799998-erin", "userReview": "The Lying Game is the third Ruth Ware novel I've read and I have to say I liked it the most. It was great but it was an improvement over the previous books. I know everyone else just loves Ruth Ware novels but I just think there okay. If you read The Woman in Cabin 10 or In a Dark, Dark Wood than you'll probably like this one."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer", "userReview": "\u201c...it's amazing how quickly it comes back, the facility to lie.\u201d\n\n The Lying Game may be my favorite Ruth Ware novel to date. Yes, it has a lot of the \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" vibe going on but I didn't care. I loved the characters, the alternating time frames, the family dynamics, the friendships, the secrets, the small-town dysfunction, the mystery, the thriller components, the social structure, the lying... and once the lying was done, at the very end, when truths were finally forced out, I even loved that. The Lying Game will be a re-read for me for sure. Check it out!My favorite quote:\u201cI didn't have the best childhood. You get fucked-up, you're liable to pass that on.\u201d \u201cBullshit.\u201d \u2026 \u201cIf that were true, none of us would ever reproduce. We've all got baggage. What about all the good qualities you've got to pass on?\u201d ... \u201c...no one knows what kind of parent they'll be. Crap people have babies every day \u2013 but the difference is they don't care. You do \u2013 that's what makes the difference.\u201d8/1/2017:4.5 stars. I really enjoyed this.RTC"}], "description": "From the instant New York Times bestselling author of blockbuster thrillers In a Dark, Dark Wood and The Woman in Cabin 10 comes Ruth Ware\u2019s chilling new novel.On a cool June morning, a woman is walking her dog in the idyllic coastal village of Salten along a tidal estuary known as the Reach.
