YOU DIE. These are simple words, though they\u2019re my favourite phrase so far. Every society needs rules, and it shows how desperate this one is to create such a brutally necessary one. If you want to live under Rick\u2019s protection, that\u2019s the pact you take. If you kill another group member, if you kill a friend, you, too, will die. Seems fair enough in this world, but nothing is that simple. As soon as this line was delivered I knew the rule would soon be broken\u2026.At least they tried though. Sometimes false hope is the only hope. I think it is so appropriate how the characters have deluded themselves; they really think they\u2019ve found a new home in the prison: they think it\u2019s a safe haven. They have to be able to carry on. It\u2019s kind of funny really in a twisted sort of way. Or am I just being a bit evil? As Rick likes to say, all too frequently, \u201cwe can make this work.\u201d But, it is so abundantly clear that this would never be true because everybody is slowly losing their sanity. The prison could never last not with every one trying to kill each other.That\u2019s the good thing about this series. It isn\u2019t just about zombies going around eating people: it isn\u2019t a simple case of horror thrown over action. It\u2019s all about the survivors and how they cope with their approaching demise. Some fight it with all they\u2019ve got. Some are too weak to fight at all, and the rest just give up about half way through. The fighters are the ones who have to deal with the horrors they have to commit in order to survive. They go crazy. They try to kill each other in a fit of pure rage fuelled grief. But, somehow, they carry on. They live with what they\u2019ve done. They either become stronger or they fall to madness. I can\u2019t predict who is going to be the next to die or to lose it. The lines between sanity and insanity, right and wrong, are becoming increasingly blurred. The situation is only going to get worse, and more entertaining (evil laugh)."}, {"userName": "Riley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23179211-riley", "userReview": "This was the best volume so far!"}, {"userName": "Alejandro", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/665584-alejandro", "userReview": "Prisons are ideal places in this reality!\n This is the third volume of the softcover editions of \"The Walking Dead\", collecting the comic book issues from #13 to #18.Creative Team:Writer: Robert KirkmanIllustrators: Charlie Adlard Additional gray tones to inking: Cliff Rathburn Chapter Three\nSAFETY BEHIND BARS\n \nI ain\u2019t gonna bury you again you son of a bitch.\nIn our society, you never would want to go prison, but in an apocalyptical dystopia plagued with zombies, a prison would look like the logical choice.Rick\u2019s group finds a federal penitentiary, that it seems to be the place to expiate their sins, but also they can be a site with its own kind of sinners.A shocking revelation will expose a new facet about their life-and-death condition.And also, they will find soon enough that zombies may be deadly, but men are evil.

Not only that, though, Lori and Rick's son Carl shot Shane dead. Not only that, though, Shane was buried after his death, and Rick realizes over the course of the story that Shane is probably zombified (more on this later), so he goes back, digs Shane up, and kills him again. Sweet.It's not about being bitten anymore -- That's right. You don't have to die with a Zombie biting you to turn. All you need to do is die. You die, and you come back. How do we know? Chris and Julie (Tyreese's daughter) gave each other their virginity then enacted their suicide pact. As these things are wont to do, the suicide pact only resulted in Julie's death, and as soon as she died, with no zombies in sight, she was reanimated and trying to eat her grieving father's neck. Rick finishes her zombieness off, while Tyreese strangles his daughter's lover to death. What a meany!Prisoners and Serial Killers -- It's not enough that our band of merry wanderers finds a prison and have to clear it out, but they also find a small cache of prisoners, still alive and eating meatloaf in the prison mess hall: a murderer (he killed his wife and her lover), a druggy drug dealer, an aging biker in prison for theft, and a white collar tax evader. Next thing you know, heads -- and not zombie heads -- are literally rolling, and one of our prisoners is a serial killer. Surprise, surprise, surprise. Love Connections Galore -- Andrea hooks up with Dale. Chris and Julie hook up pre-mortem. Tyreese and Carol keep their relationship going between mop up jobs. Glenn and Maggie get all romantic over a barber chair. Dexter and Andrew, former inmates, start to see their man love cool. And even little Carl hooks up with little Sophia. It's fun for all ages. It's no wonder AMC's making it for the small screen. The melodrama suits TV perfectly. What really keeps me reading, though, isn't all the silly shit -- which has its place and I do enjoy -- it's the constant shifting of ethical and moral attitudes as these people get deeper and deeper in to the Zombiepocalypse. Their ideas are constantly fluctuating; some of them talk a good game about retaining their humanity, then quickly blow it all in a moment of madness; they try to make laws to govern themselves and don't realize (at least most of them don't) that they've already been violated; the whole band of them are full of hypocrisy and selfishness and the baser human instincts, and the way it's being handled is definitely making the journey fun. I don't know that all of this behavioural stuff can be sustained, but it is my favourite part of the graphic novels, no doubt about it."}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/665947-craig", "userReview": "I don't know what it is about this series. I don't find it to be exceptional in any way and yet I keep buying the next volume because I feel like a zombie read and I figure I'm following these characters already....They aren't bad reads, but there's just very little 'new' in them and there seems to be a cycle forming with these volumes that leads to less character growth.I'm not sure if it is the art, the writing, or a combination of both, but I find it hard to tell many of the secondary characters apart at points. It makes it difficult to really care about too many characters within the story.Also, Lori's character becomes more unbelievable with every volume - it is painfully obvious that she is written by a man. Then again, most of these characters - male and female - are very one-dimensional.I know it sounds like I am just railing on this one, but I'm sure I'll find myself buying the next volume, so Kirkman must be doing something right."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7477266-sarah", "userReview": "Things are really getting crazy now!

They believe that they have found the perfect place to live; space for everyone, food, and best of all, no zombies! But, as is almost always the case with The Walking Dead, nothing ever goes quite as planned.My Thoughts:I will just cut to the chase \u2013 Safety Behind Bars has been my favorite. I\u2019m kind of surprised that after three zombie-filled volumes, that these graphic novels still deliver big. I found this installment to be bloodier, more shocking, and overall more edge-of-your-seat than the previous two. I feel that this is quite the feat considering how much I liked the first two volumes.I think the main reason that this story continues to feel fresh is the introduction of new characters. While there are many characters that have been present in all three volumes, there are also many new additions. These new characters add a lot to the story because there is often a little backstory accompanying there introduction, and because you are constantly wondering if they are f\u2019ing crazy or not. The story is also helped along by the constant traveling. The characters, thinking they are safe, try to make a home in various places, yet are forced to uproot time and time again. This constant flux in setting serves as another way to keep the story interesting. Oh, yeah\u2026I can\u2019t not elaborate a teensy bit more on the \u2018bloodier\u2019 and \u2018more shocking\u2019 aspects. LOTS of killing happens, and not just of the zombie variety. I\u2019m talking fucked-up, did-that-just-happen kind of killing. And, it happens more than once. I will leave you with that.Overall:As I said, this has been my favorite volume thus far. I am impressed that this story continues to shock and interest me. Maybe by the time I get to volume #14 I\u2019ll think differently, but until then \u2013 read on!"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "Ohhhhh snippity snap!

This time, I will rate them by the volume that they are.WrensReads Review:The third volume is my favorite so far. Rick and the gang are cleaning out the prison to make it into a home. Rick swallow his pride and tells Hershel and his family to come live in the prison with them because it is safer there.Or is it?You see, there are prisoners there that don't know what has been going on in the outside world. They have been using the freezer to poop in, eating all they can eat out of the canned foods, and probably just swapping murder stories and giving each other pointers for when they get out. But you can't judge a book for what they got committed for, right?Well, wrong and right.See now someone is actually killing people in the prison. Is it Dexter, the big brood who already claimed the fact he killed his wife and her boyfriend? Or the drug addict Andrew who says he is the cause of the apocalypse? Probably not the tax fraud guy Thomas, though he does look a little creepy. wait! What about the peeper Axel who walks in on some of the girls showering so he can \"hurry up and go back to his room before the image goes away\"? All this while trying to get \"zombies\" out of the prison they are trying to make a home.Which brings me to my only disappointment: they have been using \"zombie\" instead of their made up ones like \"roamers\" \"walkers\" \"lurkers\". It makes me sad. Also, this is where \nRICKTATORSHIP\n starts to take off. His word or die. I feel like \"thought a lot about _____ and he knows that ______ is the only way\" is his signature line.

This is a book where the dead are dug out of their graves just to be shot in the head, and that\u2019s not even counting the butchered children or the suicide pacts! So the group have made it to a prison which is infested with zombies but, once cleared, could be a safe haven for them. Inside are a handful of remaining inmates - but can these convicted criminals be trusted around the families? At this point in the series I\u2019ve actually started to remember some of the characters\u2019 names as a core number have survived but the cast is still very big and is continually dropping off and adding new characters so its difficult to care all that much when someone dies. Robert Kirkman\u2019s dialogue also isn\u2019t as terrible in this book though the tone remains unrelentingly dark. When kids are being killed or are planning on killing one another, the adults are standing around shell-shocked, crying internally or externally, with characters like Rick or Hershel melodramatically blaming themselves for all the death. When Rick dug up Shane to shoot him in the head again, I had to laugh at how absurdly depressing it all was - even when you\u2019ve been killed once you\u2019re not safe! I did notice one weird detail Kirkman\u2019s added: whether you\u2019ve been bitten or not, once you die, you become a zombie (also they call them zombies in the book, unlike the TV show where they\u2019re called \u201cwalkers\u201d). I don\u2019t understand how that works - if you have the potential to become a zombie, shouldn\u2019t you become a zombie rather than wait to die off? The inmates added an interesting slant as the story became a murder mystery over which one of the prisoners chopped up the kids, and the reveal was a surprise. There\u2019s also the requisite zombie action which has already become rote and, despite the large cast, I\u2019m not really interested in about 90% of their mundane stories.I still don\u2019t fully see what fans of the series do but the third volume is definitely a step up from the previous books and even manages to become quite exciting in parts. I\u2019m bumping the rating up a star because Rick literally tells the ever-annoying Lori to shut the fuck up!"}, {"userName": "Brendon Schrodinger", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-brendon-schrodinger", "userReview": "Volume 2 concluded with the confrontation with Herschel and his family and the gang leaving with no food and no direction. The final panel had them come across a prison.So I choose to call Volume 3 'The Walking Dead in da Clink'.There are lots of great ideas and themes brought forward in this issue. The main thing is an exploration of criminality in the past compared to in the zombie apocalypse. The prison is not quite deserted; lots of zombies of course, but 4 prisoners have managed to survive. Each tells the gang what they were put away for and there is one convicted murderer in the group. How will they manage to coexist?Not everything goes swimmingly. And it's not all the prisoner's fault. There are the weak in the gang. And Rick decides that since they have a great environment that can be made safe and has plenty of food and land behind fences. that he has to go and invite Herschel's group into the prison.It's fascinating that even though they are in what they presumed to be a safe place, the body count is still escalating. And Dale points this out. Good ol' Dale. And it's also fascinating what Tyreese says about how they are all just ticking down until their eventual deaths at the hands of zombies. The Walking Dead of the title may not be referring to the zombies.Also there is some revelations the nature of the disease that is making these zombies. Long term survival is also thought of with Herschel starting a garden with the plan to bring some of his livestock over also.And the security of their prime situation is also questioned. Would other groups of survivors want the prison also?This is one of the better volumes where the exploration of ideas is ramped up and the group seems to band together rather than whinging."}, {"userName": "Brightness", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10764362-brightness", "userReview": "It's official - comic book Lori is far more annoying than tv Lori.And this was the best moment so far."}, {"userName": "Darren Hagan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34101852-darren-hagan", "userReview": "The group arrive at the prison and start to make a home there, and start to feel safe.

I was elated. Then reality sank in. I was still stinging from what had been done to the Terry Gooodkind novel series, The Sword of Truth. My mind spun, prompting me to dig out the series, wondering where the problems might occur. No surprise, the volume that solidifies the series as truly great, the one that earns Robert Kirkman the title I alluded to in my review of volume 1, Days Gone By. King of the Zombie Genre, is the one with some of the most disturbing sequences (so far). Simply put, bad things happen here. Provided the series is a success, this is where I will watch with concern on how AMC handles the story.Safety Behind Bars gives us the modern day equivalent to the infamous mall setting: a prison. If you\u2019ve never seen one of your state\u2019s correctional facilities up close, first \u2013 yay for you! These facilities have a huge upside when considering a place to seek security from the zombie threat. Of course, there is a downside: the current residents.In safety Behind Bars Rick Grimes and his band of survivors are on the verge of starvation. A prison is their oasis, but you just have to know there will be problems, you won\u2019t be wrong.This volume does an excellent job of enhancing the personalities of the supporting cast that surrounds our central protagonist, Rick Grimes. Tyreese earns co-star billing and Lori Grimes, Rick\u2019s wife asserts herself as well, finally giving the story an actual leading lady.There are some very disturbing twists and turns in Safety Behind Bars. Also, Kirkman takes time here to establish some of his own mythology. All I will say is that, just because you aren\u2019t bitten\u2026that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re safe from turning. This volume is not light on the body count and I am overwhelmingly impressed by how fearless Kirkman is in whittling away at his cast. You start to wonder if he has something against poor Hershel.The survivors face their first splash of cold water in this arc of the story. How do you deal with a serious crime when there is no more law? When the rules have been erased, who makes the new ones? Also, there are foreshadowing\u2019s of future problems. Safety Behind Bars is an excellent catalyst for several future story arcs. Sticking with the formula, the story ends with a cliffhanger. I stand behind my earlier proclamations in regards to Robert Kirkman as the new King.
