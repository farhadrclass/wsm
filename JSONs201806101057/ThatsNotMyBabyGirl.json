The previous baby was pink. We suspect our protagonist is making things more complicated than they need to be. \"That's not my baby,\" she continues. \"Her teddy is too fluffy.\" We find it impossible to read this page without using our porno voices.We sympathize with the protagonist, in a way. When we pick our baby up from day care, we sometimes have a moment when we think, \"Oh shit: which one is ours?\" Babies look similar. We look for the one who seems pleased to see us. We hope this has been a good strategy.There are two brown babies at our day care. We know they are not ours, even though they are not wearing mittens.Our baby, or anyway the one who is at our house, loves the last page where there is a mirror. He opens the book to that page and laughs and closes it again. He does this many times. Then he starts crying. We don't know why. Perhaps he has realized that he is not our baby. If so, we apologize. Your baby is very friendly. We're not saying this is all his fault. Some of it is our baby's fault. He should have been more pleased to see us."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4282254-jennifer", "userReview": "Sasha loves this book!

Did not realise this was the 'girl' version until I'd read it a couple of times. Does not matter as my son enjoys it anyway - giggles when he sees the front, reaches out to touch all the textures and loves the mirror on the last page."}, {"userName": "Jenna Mills", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7762437-jenna-mills", "userReview": "I enjoyed the different materials more than bub!
