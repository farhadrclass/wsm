They are enjoying the lifestyle of \u201cempty nesters\u201d yet they still maintain a close relationship with their three daughters. Their oldest daughter Meg is a political journalist and engaged to the son of a United States Senator. Amy has a career in the fashion world and a serious boyfriend of five years. Third daughter Jo is struggling with her career and was recently dumped by her girlfriend.All three daughters get engaged within a few months of each other. The daughters are in the midst of these exciting life events but Meryl\u2019s personal life starts to unravel. The Becker\u2019s are encountering money issues, and do not have the means to pay for all the weddings separately. At the same time, Meryl\u2019s aging mother has moved in with them. Meryl is angry at her husband for the choices he has made, putting them in financial disarray. At the same time, she is not honest with her daughters about the situation, and still wants to throw them their weddings. Tensions build and relationships are tested. This was a fun, enjoyable book. It is not predictable, and I was caught off guard by the ending. The author did a nice job of keeping the sibling tension and emotions genuine. We are privy to the sisters\u2019 inner thoughts about their relationships with one another and with their soon to be spouses. The dynamic of this family is well depicted. I can definitely see this book being made into a movie.I am giving away 3 signed copies on my blog until 10/28 https://www.facebook.com/suzyapproved...#"}, {"userName": "Cindy Burnett", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2445617-cindy-burnett", "userReview": "4.5 starsI LOVED this book! Jamie Brenner has written a fun, highly entertaining book about three sisters, Meg, Amy and Jo Becker, who in a short span of time all get engaged to be married to wealthy, much sought-after men. At the same time, the Becker family\u2019s economic status is questionable so Meryl Becker decides to throw a triple wedding for the three girls. She manages to convince the girls, but trying to deal with all of her new soon-to-be in-laws proves much trickier. Moreover, each Becker daughter is grappling with her own issues that threaten the engagements. To top it all off, the triple wedding catches the attention of People Magazine and other celebrity magazines which adds one more complication to the already tense production.Meg was probably my favorite of the sisters, but I was invested in all three of their relationships and enjoyed reading about their stories as they played out in the novel.The book was just wonderful, and I could not put it down. I absolutely loved the way the wedding played out and the ultimate resolution of the story. I highly recommend this novel.

While the plot itself is a little far-fetched, the story has a great message in the end.Brenner introduces us to the Becker family\u2014Hugh and Meryl and their three daughters; Meg, Amy, and Jo. Meg is engaged to the son of a well-known politician whose family comes from old money. Amy is set to marry her boyfriend of five years whose proposal seems to have come out of left field. And poor Jo. She's heartbroken after a sudden break-up and finds comfort in her best friend who's always been in love with her.\u00a0In the beginning, it appears as though the girls have found happiness. But as Brenner peels back the layers on their lives, their reality is far from perfect.This book would make a really great move, perhaps as a comedy. The way that it's written with the reader being privy\u00a0to each sister's relationship and uncovered secrets would play out nicely on film.\u00a0Meryl's character reminded me a lot of the mom in Pride and Prejudice with her excitement over her girls' engagements, almost blinded by what was really going on.I don't know what about Jo's story that I found so compelling, but I just couldn't wait to hear what happened next! She gets her heartbroken by her college best friend turned live-in girlfriend. But Jo's the impulsive one of the bunch and jumps into bed with her guy best friend who's been in love with her since he first met her. Did I mention that he's Danish royalty?It took me quite a bit to get into this one. In the beginning, the way the characters and plot moved along felt like the author was making a play-by-play of events, rather than telling me a story. But what turned it around for me was getting to know the girls and the family dynamic. You'll have to read it to find out who, if anyone, makes it to the \"you may now kiss the bride\" part.* I received an advance copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.\nRead this Review \u2022 My Website \u2022 Facebook \u2022 Twitter \u2022 Pinterest \u2022 Instagram \u2022 Subscribe by Email****************\u2605\u2605UPCOMING BOOK RELEASES\u2605\u2605****************"}, {"userName": "Joanna Park", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26160119-joanna-park", "userReview": "Meryl Becker finds herself throwing the wedding of the decade when her three beautiful-but very different daughters, Meg, Amy & Jo all get engaged at the same time to very different but successful men. This would be difficult enough but when her husband Hugh gets fired from his job, Meryl has to come up with a new way to pay for the wedding her daughter's want while still maintaining control from the girls controlling in laws. As the countdown to the wedding starts and more secrets are revelled, more drama ensures and with the added difficulty of trying to care for her ageing mother to deal with, Meryl wonders if she'll ever manage to get her girls down the isle.I really liked this book! It was really fast flowing, easy to read and i got into it straight away wanting to know what happens next. The characters are brilliant and quite diverse. I like how each had their own individual stories, that were told along side each other. This meant you really got to know each character and learn their back story which helped you to understand why they acted as they did. My favorite character, by miles was Rose Meryl's mother. I like her attitude towards life and to all the drama surrounding the wedding. The way she just said things regardless of social niceties or people feelings was brilliant and contibuted to some of the most funny bits of the book. The author has obviously had some experience of wedding planning and having sisters as some of the scenes described were close to what happened to me at my wedding and my childhood with my sisters. This made the book seem more realistic and made me feel emphathy towards the siblings (particularly Amy who i felt character wise was most like me) and Meryl with the stresses of the wedding. I also really like the ending. I did wonder how the author was going to end it and hoped it wasn't going to be a predictable, sugar-coated ending which it wasn't. It was the ending i hoped for and i like the characters even more because of it. There were a few tiny things that i didn't like about the book. Meryl seems a confused character, she is discribed as being very caring and always there for her girls but then seems to be too distracted with keeping control of the wedding to help her family. When Hugh gets fired her reaction is, oh well at least you can be involved in the wedding ! I don't think i know many guys who did want to be involved in their own wedding never mind their daughters. It also urked me that everyone in the book was described as beautiful, handsome or successful there didn't seem to be any average, every day people! This was the first book i have read by Jamie Brenner and it definetly won't be the last. I have already recommended this book to a lot of my friends as i thought it was so good. Definetly one of my top books of all time.

Meg, the oldest, is a journalist covering politics inside the beltway. She's engaged to Stowe, the son of billionaire US Senator who just might be running for president. Amy, the middle child, is a rising star in the world of fashion, and competitive and envious of her two sisters. She's engaged to her boyfriend of five years, Andy, who is the son of a famous designer. Jo, the free-spirit, is getting married to her best friend, Toby, despite being attracted to women. She's recovering from a heartbreak and desperate to avoid falling in love again.So how does an average family deal with three high profile engagements all at the same time? Not very well, as it turns out.The weak link in this book is Meryl-- one of the least likable characters I've ever encountered. She's proud of her daughters, Meg in particular, for marrying into such \"prominent families\" (as if that's something to care about at all). At the same time, she's freakishly paranoid that these wealthy, powerful families will take over \"her\" weddings. She can't afford one lavish wedding, let alone three, but stubbornly insists upon it in to retain control. She then pimps out her daughters to People magazine to cover the costs. When lesbian Jo announces her engagement to man out of the blue, Meryl doesn't even stop to question her daughter's fractured emotional state. She simply starts planning the wedding. When her husband is suspended from his job, she actually suggests it's a \"blessing in disguise\" because \"you get to be involved in the wedding planning.\" Yes, because when a man loses his income, his first concern is helping to ensure his further financial destruction-- what an opportunity!What saved the book for me were the three daughters, all of whom had compelling stories in their own ways. Meryl's harping aside, this story is about much more than weddings and how to pay for them. It's about the choices we make, and the people we love. * Thank you to the publisher and netgalley for granting me access to this title"}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4810658-kristina", "userReview": "Other than one glaring timeline mess:Three months before the Wedding: Far enough along in pregnancy to have been sick \"for weeks\"One month before the Wedding: \"Almost three months\" pregnant24 Hours before the Wedding: \"Seven months pregnant\"I really enjoyed this book.

I was hoping for a mad cap wedding story featuring a mother, clueless father, and tales of love. Once the engagements began I got quite the opposite from the book. Mom Meryl became super obsessed with etiquette and money \u2013 it distorted her true nature and caused me not to like her as a character. Hasn\u2019t she read enough Emily Post to know that in this day and age it doesn\u2019t matter who pays for what? Since 4 of the 6 patricipants had enough income on their own \u2013 they probably should have been contributing to the bottom line. And why did only the Campions have to pay for the rehearsal dinner? Last time I had checked \u2013 there were two other extremely wealthy families involved in the wedding that could have chipped in.What I loved: Rose, the grandmother, was a beautiful soul who could come with the wit when needed. I thought her backstory was beautiful and touching \u2013 it explained so much and allowed everyone to move forward in their relationship. And her little white lie about Polish wedding traditions was adorable.What I didn\u2019t love: Where should I begin? Every man is a selfish douche in the book (Stowe redeems himself in the end but that\u2019s all about the epilogue and the readers don\u2019t get to see his transition into a good guy). Amy is Jan Brady \u2013 always a day late and a dollar short. Her fierce competition with her sister almost ruins the book.

The character development is outstanding for Meg, Amy and Jo! I never feel as if I am wanting more, I know them, I know their stories and these are some girls I would love to be friends with! They are smart, driven, determined - well Meg and Amy are, Jo she's the baby and she will get there someday. I will give it to Jo, she has the passion but she can't seem to settle on a path, she's clueless at the moment.The drama starts to unfold when Meg is proposed to and the wedding craziness begins! Meryl (mom) is excited for Meg, Amy is livid because she believes that it should be her getting married (after all she has been with her boyfriend well over 5 years- basically forever), and Jo well she is a whole other story in and of herself that I will have you piece together little by little as you read.Things start to go down hill little by little - wedding disasters, cheating scandals, job loss, illness, mixed feelings, and more, yes I said more.Meryl and Hugh feel like it may be OK - and then Amy and Jo announce their engagements -3 weddings in a year - I bet they are close to losing their minds! I know I would be!And if that wasn't enough, they are thrust into the media spotlight for better and for worse. It's not always sunshine and rainbows - it can get downright ugly!

All opinions are mine. Here's the thing about this book: I don't hate it but I don't love it either. When I first read the blurb, I have to admit that I was intrigued. I hope that there's going to be some family and wedding drama, something that I can really enjoy and probably relate to. However, this book kind of fell flat for me. I don't get the drama at all.None of the characters are relatable to me at all. I wanted to like Meryl, I wanted to fight for Meg, I wanted to comfort Jo and I wanted to understand Amy but all I get from them all are frustration. I'm frustrated with how their characters were developed. Every time they make their choices, I literally facepalmed because I cannot believe they did that. And don't get me started on the guys. Sure, they're like celebrated bachelors, supposedly coming from good, prominent families but nothing about them makes you feel like the girls deserved any of them.When I first started reading this, based on the blurb, I was expecting dramas and even though there were dramas of some kind (paparazzis are involved), I just couldn't help but feel detached to it all. Every time I read through passages like that, I felt the need to skim through.Overall this book is not all that bad.

The same character is described as looking like Grace Kelly three times. Does anyone under 40 know who Grace Kelly is? Couldn't the author come up w a more modern classic beauty? And if not, maybe mentioning it once is sufficient. Other irritating parts:That the mom didn't know her mother Rose was the mysterious Roza in the never before seen pictures that look like her daughter... That it was so obvious the triple wedding would blow up at the altar...That the youngest daughter is described as being the tallest in the family but the mom greets her and kisses her on top of the head...That in the chapter \"one month before the wedding\" the youngest daughter tells the wedding dress designer she's three months pregnant but then on the wedding day one month later she's magically seven months pregnant...Okay, I will stop.

Three sisters get engaged the same year and a triple wedding is planned. I expected hijinks and cute situations and fun. Instead I read a tale of selfish people and an intense need to be seen as high class. Meryl, the mother of Meg, Amy, and Jo, is determined to throw her daughters the perfect wedding and will not accept help from anyone else. Oh, except from People magazine and some PR folks. Her husband, a seemingly sweet academic, decides to make an odd stand and potentially screw his family with no care for them,\u00a0and Jo and Amy get engaged for all the wrong reasons.The plot of The Wedding Sisters had such potential. Instead it was like reading a script of Bridezillas featuring Momzillas on the warpath.\u00a0The writing of Jamie Brenner had some really good moments. There were a few very funny parts and some real emotion, but the plot just dragged the great moments down. The\u00a0pacing also had some issues. The time would skip a few months at a time, it was stated at the start of the chapter which was nice, but it still felt like there were some holes in the timeline.\u00a0The world built was very limited, to mainly the home of Meryl, but this was primarily a character driven tale so it wasn't detrimental to the story.\u00a0There were some great\u00a0emotions, however they were overshadowed by the intense need to be seen as important. The characters were all pretty awful. Greedy, selfish and so obsessed with how they were perceived, I disliked them all but Meg. She was a least a shining light in the story and I was glad I could latch on to her to follow through.The Wedding Sisters could have been amazing. Jamie Brenner\u00a0had some great moments but the arc she took the family on just didn't work for me. I didn't hate the story, I was just turned off by the actions of the characters. That made this an average read for me; not great but not awful. Favorite lines - \u201cBut you should not intentionally set out to live a life without love. And you should realize that now, while you\u2019re young\u2014before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Biggest clich\u00e9 - But that's how I want it!\u00a0Have you read The Wedding Sisters, or added it to your TBR?This book was most likely received free from the publisher/author in exchange for an honest review.

Other than their familial bond, these women are nothing alike and are at very different places in their lives. Always perfect Meg is an up-and-coming journalist who's madly in love with her husband-to-be, Stowe, the eldest offspring of an ambitious politician. Competitive middle child Amy works for a fashion designer whose son she's been dating since college even though she feels like their relationship is missing something. And directionless Jo is a barista who has no idea what she wants to do with her life. When her heart is broken by the person she thought was \"The One,\" she impulsively turns to her best friend who's been nursing a crush on her for years.Overwhelmed by the expense and effort required to get all three of their daughters down the aisle, the Becker parents decide to throw a triple wedding. But trying to control the media, make all the in-laws happy, and get the sisters to agree on the details of the ceremony takes its toll on Meryl and Hugh. Soon, the cracks in their marriage, as well as in the relationships of the brides-to-be, start to show. Will all these couples survive the wedding fuss, or will their new beginnings actually be endings?I really can't say enough good things about this book! It was such a fascinating and entertaining read. I blew through The Wedding Sisters in just a few short days, then I was sad that I had finished it so quickly! I take my hat off to the author who did an expert job of juggling so many characters and intersecting storylines. I loved her evocative writing style and how beautifully layered all the characters were. Honestly, I went back and forth many times as to whose side I was on in all of the conflicts in the book. In one chapter, I'd be rooting a character on, then in the next I'd want to give that person a good shake, which was awesome because real people are flawed and they don't always make the right decisions. In the end, all the characters got the closure they needed on their big issues and the happy endings that were appropriate for them, so it was very satisfying.I highly recommend The Wedding Sisters to anyone who enjoys a compelling story about life, love, and family. I sure feel like I caught the bouquet with this wonderful book and I look forward to reading more from the very talented Jamie Brenner."}, {"userName": "Lisa Barr", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11723323-lisa-barr", "userReview": "I breezed through Jamie Brenner\u2019s fabulous novel \u201cThe Wedding Sisters\u201d. I laughed, cried, worried, cheered, and celebrated with Meg, Amy and Jo (yes, \"Little Women\"). In this case, three modern-day sisters are poised to get married. The sisters couldn\u2019t be any more different\u2014albeit each wants the same thing: true love. Full disclosure: I\u2019m a Mom of three daughters, and the Becker Sisters not only hit close to home, the trio could be sitting at my kitchen table. The sisters\u2019 penetrating stories are held together through the voice and tender heart of their mother, Meryl Becker, who is loving, overbearing, oft-controlling\u2014but of course, ONLY wants the best for her girls. And yet, Meryl must \u201clet go\u201d while simultaneously holding her \u201cbabies\u2019 close\u2014because they still need her. She is the quintessential multi-tasker\u2014handling her daughters\u2019 complex love lives, her aging, aloof mother (with secrets of her own), and her absent-minded English professor husband (whose students, at times, take precedence over his family). Everybody\u2019s life and personality is a juggling act for Meryl, and every day during \u201cwedding season\u201d is a full-on drama. Meryl deals with broken hearts, sibling rivalries, and passions \u2014including her own middle-aged desires, which re-awaken amidst trying to simultaneously plan the three weddings and all the trimmings. Not to mention, the weddings aren\u2019t just your run-of-the mill \u201cBig Day\u201d\u2014each daughter is marrying a Somebody. The Beckers\u2019 world quickly morphs into public fodder, filling the gossip columns. And we see it all: love lost, love found, infidelity, lies, and ultimately, truths exposed. The twists and turns while tying the matrimonial knots make the Becker Sisters\u2019 colorful tale an unputdownable read, as each character forges her own path toward Happily Ever After. I devoured this hands-down perfect beach book in ONE sitting, or as the Sisters might say, in ONE brisk walk down the aisle."}, {"userName": "Gina Wynn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45915621-gina-wynn", "userReview": "I found the main character, Meryl, quite hard to get along with. I didn't understand many of her actions, so I found her tricky to relate to. There were also more points of view than I expected in the book, but I didn't feel like I particularly gelled with any of them.My favourite character was Meryl's mother, but I'm not sure she was really used enough or if her thread just got a bit lost in the rest of the story. Same as with the thread where Meryl could have had an affair, and it just fizzled into a nothing situation, instead. The same as with the storyline with Hugh's student. I felt there were missed opportunities here.The blurb promised a lot, but I'm not sure it completely delivered. I expected something a lot more light-hearted - maybe even chick lit in tone. Something more comedic, but I read a different story with a lot of soul searching although I'm not sure I got to know the characters very well.I didn't have a very big love for the parallels with Little Women - the book would have fared equally well without them, although Hugh would have needed a different reason for being. The references felt a little shoe-horned in to give Meryl a reason to dislike her husband.I loved the concept of this book when I read the blurb, but it surprised me by being something other than what I expected. It was entirely readable and a good story. It just didn't grab me and make me love it.I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Christina (Confessions of a Book Addict)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2418140-christina-confessions-of-a-book-addict", "userReview": "Meryl Becker appears to have it all. She's been married for thirty years to Hugh, who is a dedicated teacher at one of New York City's best private schools; plus, he is an author. Her daughters are doing well, especially her eldest daughter, Meg. Meg is engaged to Stowe who is the son of a prominent US politician and a member of an elite family. Her younger daughters, Amy and Jo, also become engaged this year to sons of powerful American families. This normally would be cause to celebrate, except how can they afford three separate and extravagant weddings? Meryl is insistent that they pay for it themselves since she wants to make it a bonding experience and have control of every detail, but how will this work? Things start to unravel for Meryl though. Her husband loses his teaching position, her mother starts falling apart, there's media attention, and she has the pressure from her future in-laws, not to mention the regular complications while planning a wedding.

English professor Hugh and wife Meryl have three daughters: Meg, Amy, and Jo. Sound familiar? :) When the three young ladies accept marriage proposals from their respective \u2013 and wealthy and socially prominent \u2013 boyfriends, a triple wedding is planned. I very much enjoyed the characters and the plot outline in this book. The writing was technically excellent, and the dialogue was on point. But there was something imperfect about it. Part of my struggle was that I thought this book was going to be quirky and fun, but it didn\u2019t quite make it there. Brenner maybe needed to write with a little more jaunt and insouciance. Or if whimsical wasn\u2019t the goal, more dramatic and saga-type scenes would have helped me identify the mood. Brenner did impress me by keeping the characters true to themselves, right up until the very end. I appreciate an author who will take a risk with every single character, making them face their own truths in order to be authentic to the people around them.https://randombookmuses.com/2016/06/0...NetGalley provided an advance copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28180449-sharon", "userReview": "I would like to thank the Goodreads First Reads Giveaway and NetGalley for providing me with review copies of The Wedding Sisters.One daughter getting married is tough enough, financially and emotionally, but three threatens to break apart the marriage of Meryl and Hugh. The Wedding Sisters chronicles the trials and tribulations of the Becker family, as they navigate the planning of three weddings. Will Meryl's idea prove to be ingenious or will the complications and stresses of life outside of the impending nuptials destroy everything?Honestly, the author spent so much time on the convoluted plot that she neglected the character development. Besides mostly all of the characters being shallow and selfish, the author never conveyed any depth with regards to their feelings and emotions. This beach read is a solid three stars - readers might enjoy the inside look at wedding planning on a stratospheric scale. Personally, the ending fell flat for me and I never felt any vested interest in the outcome. The Wedding Sisters was an interesting concept, but it just did not come together."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39545024-samantha", "userReview": "This book is about 3 sisters, all in relationships, that end up engaged within weeks of each other. Their parents, unbale to afford 3 huge weddings, pitch the idea to their daighters, of a triple wedding. The .3 grooms all come from VERY well off and established families so once the press catches wind of this, they become a media storm. I really enjoyed this book and give it a solid 4 stars. Based on the description, I thought that this would be a light beachy read and initially was disappointed that it wouldn't be. Luckily, I fell in love with the sisters and was eager to see how this would all pan out. I didn't care for Meryl (the mother) or Rose (though she grew on me by the end) in the slightest. I loved the sisters, even the grooms, as well as Hugh (the father). The characters developed well throughout the story and truly enjoyed how it ebbed and flowed. I loved how original the plot was - I can totally imagine this being a movie starring Sandra Bullock!A special thanks to Netgalley and St. Martin's Press for the copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}], "description": "Meryl Becker is living a mother's dream.
