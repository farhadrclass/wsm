Yet I will mention that this #2 (2011) in my Kalila and Dimna series was harder to build than the first #1 (1980). That's why I had to wait a few decades to acquire enough skill and strength to tackle it :) Lazy too, me? Of course not!"}, {"userName": "Aubrey Davis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8777771-aubrey-davis", "userReview": "Ramsay Wood has spent 30 years reviving Kalila and Dimna,an all but forgotten treasure of world literature. His second installment is as edgy, playful, and thought-provoking as the first. This Eastern classic is the most translated book in the world after the Bible. And yet these marvelous tales have been too often dismissed as trivial and childish. Wood has produced the first modern retelling in over 400 years.Quirky, violent, deceitful, all too human animals populate this second collection of familiar and unfamiliar fables. Ostensibly intended to educate princes and commoners in ways of world, it uncovers the harsh realities that lurk beneath our comfortable everyday subjectivity. It even includes stories about how to learn from the tales themselves. Its tales within tales structure reflects the constant flow of events and thoughts in our lives. It\u2019s easy to get lost and a shock to return to the frame tale, suddenly realizing what we\u2019ve forgotten. It\u2019s like imagining we\u2019re awake when we\u2019ve really been dreaming. Efforts to keep track of where we are and to hold these multilayered tales in our mental grip provide unparalleled opportunities to exercise our brains and allow meanings to reveal themselves in their own good time. Wood concludes the book with two masterful essays. The first outlines the history of the tale and how this treasure trove of sophisticated teaching-stories posing as humble fables has so easily slipped over borders and been embraced by so many cultures. The final essay was prompted by a challenge from a NASA Director to prove that story is a more effective medium for science outreach than technical writing. It details our limited conceptions of story together with an extended concept of its nature and value.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Ulrika Eriksson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20745803-ulrika-eriksson", "userReview": "Kalila & Dimna told by Ramsay WoodFull of fun and drama, reflections, uncommon words like gadabouts, postprandial, lollygagging\u2026, expressions and interesting information. During this second and much delightful reading I took it in a slow tempo and sucked on the candies as we say in Sweden. And I recommend that because there are so many niceties you can miss otherwise. These fables go way, way back in time, when they were oral stories told from generation to generation. Then they were written down by Buddhist monks, translated to many different languages, adapted to different cultures, published under different titles and eventually became one of the first printed books in Europe, there translated into 16 languages and became as spread and read as the Bible. The fantastic history about how these fables have followed us during the centuries one can read about in the Afterword. Now they are published again, in new clothing and Ramsay Wood tells the stories for us today with a tone that is his own, quaint and humoristic and modern but not too modern. This is the second of three planned books.Entertainment was not the main intention with the fables but to educate and pass on knowledge and wisdom to the next generation and in the frame story (just like in A Thousand and One Nights) of Kalila and Dimna there is a cruel and ignorant king who is told these stories so that he can become a better and wiser regent. Read and ponder about Spackleface, Snaggletooth and his awful wife Madam Buttercup, about the Jackal, vegetarian and closest man to the King and the vile schemes against him. Or why not read and tell just like in the old days?And do not miss the last part. In the appendix there is lot of interesting reading and many references to new science about the educational power of stories"}, {"userName": "Lila", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6075541-lila", "userReview": "Jujur, buku ini saya beli karena judulnya mengandung kata \"FABEL\" dan ada ilustrasi gajah berkelahi dengan singa. Ukuran bukunya yang ga beda jauh sama novel sama sekali ga bikin saya curiga kalau buku ini polos, tanpa ilustrasi sama sekali. Pembahasan teknis yang lain, font-nya berukuran normal sehingga otomatis buku ini hanya dapat dibacakan kepada anak-anak bukan dibaca bersama.Dari segi cerita, buku ini banyak mengisahkan cerita dalam cerita. Misalnya di kisah A1 yang mengisahkan kodok dan buaya, di dalamnya si kodok bercerita tentang kisah A1a tentang jakal dan monyet yang... mungkin saja salah satunya menceritakan kisah lain. Semacam nested story-lah. Dan kebetulan, saya kurang suka gaya bertutur seperti ini. Nilai yang terkandung di tiap cerita itu terkadang terlalu berat bagi saya sehingga agak sulit dicerna, terutama hubungan antar ceritanya (maksud saya.. apa hubungan cerita A1a dengan kondisi si kodok dan si buaya?). Dan tidak semua cerita yang tersaji berupa fabel (kisah tentang binatang) bahkan di kisah terakhir terkesan agak vulgar (IMO)Saya sangat menghargai usaha Mr. Wood untuk mengumpulkan dongeng klasik ini, diterjemahkan ke dalam Bahasa Inggris (sampai akhirnya diterjemahkan EMK ke dalam Bahasa Indonesia). Tapi sepertinya.. not my cup of book2/5 saja ^^;"}, {"userName": "Yogi Saputro", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18005093-yogi-saputro", "userReview": "Dapat buku versi bahasa indonesianya di obralan toko buku. Saya akui buku ini adalah karya memukau yang dieksekusi dengan baik. Yang paling saya sayangkan, adalah terjemahan bahasa Indonesia yang terburu-buru dan tak cermat. Ramsay Wood butuh 30 tahun untuk menyempurnakan buku ini, sementara terjemahan bahasa Indonesianya paling dirampungkan dalam 30 hari. Ada salah ketik, nama yang belum dialihkan ke bahasa Indonesia, serta pemilihan kata yang ala kadarnya.Versi aslinya pasti sangat menarik. Sebab dongeng asli India ini telah diubah sedemikian rupa sehingga konteks bahasanya dapat dipahami orang modern. Substansinya tetap. Seperti membaca cerita ala barat, bukan cerita khas India.Dari kontennya, banyak cerita menarik. Pembawaannya seperti kisah 1001 malam. Sebuah kisah diceritakan, kemudian di dalamnya ada kisah lagi. Penceritaan rekursif umumnya soal fabel dan kisah klasik. Mungkin cerita inilah cikal bakal rentetan kisah kancil di Indonesia.Secara keseluruhan, buku ini menarik. Bisa jadi inspirasi untuk mendongeng ke anak kecil. Hanya kualitas terjemahannya mengecewakan. Jadi, 3 bintang."}, {"userName": "wali_yeah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18811040-wali-yeah", "userReview": "Walaupun sebuah fabel yakni dongeng yang diutarakan oleh hewan bukan berarti ini sebuah bacaan ringan, kata-kata yang puitis dan nyaris seperti syair bikin dahi sedikit mengeriyit. Belum lagi plotnya yang dasyat yakni cerita di dalam cerita seperti film inception. Secara garis besar dongeng dengan tingkat sastra tinggi ini bercerita tentang bagaimana dunia fabel berisikan hewan-hewan menyelesaikan masalah dunia. Seluruh cerita bijaknya seperti petuah yang lama tidak terdengar."}, {"userName": "Victoria Stormdal", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37866713-victoria-stormdal", "userReview": "A much awaited sequel - reads better than volume one and I found that the stories provided some much needed food for thought."}], "description": "\u2022Kalila and Dimna\u2022 or \u2022The Panchatantra\u2022 (also known in Europe since 1483 as \u2022The Fables of Bidpai\u2022) is an ancient multi-layered, inter-connected 'frame novel' \u2014 told aloud to youngsters by an old man or his fizzy sister, Mimosa \u2014 of animal stories, with one story meandering into another, sometimes three or four deep, thereby jarring the mind from its usual neo-cortical assumption that understanding only arrives after the careful pursuit of linear pathways. These fables have contributed to world literature for over 2000 years, migrating across ancient cultures in a multitude of written and oral formats. All our beast fables from Aesop and the Buddhist \u2022Jatakas Tales\u2022 through La Fontaine to Uncle Remus owe this strange, shape-shifting 'book' a huge debt. In its original Arabic format, \u2022Kalila and Dimna\u2022 (\u2022The Panchatantra\u2022 being its Sanskrit precursor), ostensibly constitutes a handbook for rulers, a so-called 'Mirror for Princes' illustrating indirectly, through a cascade of teaching stories and verse, how to (and how not to!) run the kingdom of your life. In their slyly profound grasp of human nature at its best (and worst!) these animal fables, usually avoiding any moralistic human criticism, serve up digestible sage counsel for us all. Based on his collation of scholarly translations from key Sanskrit, Syriac, Arabic and Persian texts, as well as the 1570 English rendition by Sir Thomas North, this is the first uncompromisingly modern re-telling in either the East or West for over 400 years. In Ramsay Wood's version the profound meanings behind these ancient fables shine forth as he captures a great world classic, making it fresh, relevant, fascinating and hugely readable. This, his second volume of fables from \u2022Kalila and Dimna\u2022, picks up where the first, \u2022Fables of Friendship and Betrayal\u2022, left off - covering deceit, political skullduggery, murder, enemies, deadly monsters, kings, bees, princesses, monkeys, lions, crocodiles and how we all live and die together in peace or conflict. This is a book full of outrageously behaved animals and humans doing the most delightfully awful (yet sometimes gentle) things to each other. These are joyous, sad, amusing and sometimes brutal stories; their function being to educate both king and commoner alike in the ways of the world, the harsh realities that can often lurk beneath the surface of our cozy, everyday subjectivity.", "title": "Kalila and Dimna #2 - Fables of Conflict and Intrigue\n      \n          (Kalila and Dimna #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17694907-kalila-and-dimna-2---fables-of-conflict-and-intrigue", "average": 4.31, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1364309455l/17694907.jpg", "reviews": 7, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/978879.Ramsay_Wood", "name": "Ramsay Wood"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7020766.G_M_Whitworth", "name": "G.M.
