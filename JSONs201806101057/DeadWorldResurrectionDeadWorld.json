One of the points he makes is one I've mentioned before in my reviews, \"Most of all, I think the best zombie stories are not about the zombies at all. They're about the living: the people like you and me, trapped in the middle of an unimaginable nightmare and doing all they can to preserve what remains of their lives and loves from attack by the living dead.\"The stories here have appeared in other publications over the years, but this is the first time they have been collected in a single volume. Good news for zombie fans who may have missed these over the years.I'm not going to comment on every story, just a few standouts for me, beginning with, \"Resurrecting Mindy.\" A charming tale that reminded me of \"The Gift of the Magi,\" with zombies.\"Dating In Dead World\" is about exactly what the tile would lead you to believe and I found it to be very enjoyable.\"Bury My Heart At Marvin Gardens,\" was another story that stood out for me. I particularly liked the way it moved between an actual game of Monopoly and traversing the streets of Atlantic City during the zombie apocalypseThere is a comfort level a reader develops with certain writers. I've often felt this way with Stephen King. I feel it with Joe McKinney, too. When I start reading one of his books or short stories, I get the feeling I'm in very capable hands.After you've finished all of the stories, stick around for the Author's Notes where Joe gives some insight into each of the stories in the collection and then there's even more after that with \"A Reader's Guide to Dead World.\" There's a lot of bang for your buck in this collection from JournalStone. Dead World Resurrection: The Collected Zombie Short Stories of Joe McKinney is available now in nearly all formats at the JournalStone website.Recommended for lovers of all things zombie."}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83180-craig", "userReview": "Hey, this is good! McKinney's zombie series has been recommended to me quite a bit but I'd never gotten around to reading any of them until now; zombies are great but a little limited and I already had Keene and Grant and Maberry and the AMC crew and so on and on, so I just never found the time. However, I won a copy of Dead World Resurrection in a Goodreads giveaway and will now make an effort to catch up. This volume collects eighteen stories of various lengths, not all of them part of his Dead World sequence, and they're all well written and interesting. My favorites were clustered near the beginning of the book, \"Resurrecting Mindy,\" \"Bury My Heart at Marvin Gardens,\" \"The Day the Music Died,\" and particularly \"Dating in Dead World.\" There's also a truly strange and fun robots vs. zombies story. The book concludes with a substantial and interesting afterward in which McKinney discusses the stories and his Dead World series, and begins with an introduction by David Moody that I really didn't like because he made everything sound formulaic and prescriptive; I was happy to find the stories weren't like that at all."}, {"userName": "Caroline \u00c5sg\u00e5rd", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19812841-caroline-sg-rd", "userReview": "I received the Advance Reader Copy for free from the author through Goodreads First Reads.Before I get started, I just have to state: No, I do not watch Walking Dead or am especially interested in zombie apocalypse stuff. But I DO am a fan of horror. So that's what made me excited to get this book!This is a 350-page treat for any horror fan. There are almost 20 short stories, and what I especially loved about them is that they are different. I am amazed at how McKinney can write so many different types of stories, with such detail and such.. care, that I end up caring for the characters even in that short amount of time and want to read more about them and what happens.I have not read anything by Joe McKinney before, but I bet a fan of his would be really interested in this, as this book even includes notes on a bunch of the stories, plus the inspiration behind his other books and about the Dead World series and what order he would like you to read them in.So if you're a horror fan, and ESPECIALLY a zombie fan, you should definitely get this book!"}, {"userName": "Tad", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4021265-tad", "userReview": "I love a good zombie story told well. I don\u2019t read a ton of them and a lot of them are simply not very good. The best stories recognize that it\u2019s the other characters that are the key and zombies are just part of the background or the landscape. Joe McKinney is a good writer and Dead World Resurrection is a great collection of short stories. The stories in this collection are largely set in McKinney\u2019s Dead World. Some are more directly tethered there and a couple are completely untethered from the setting. I expect more unevenness from a short story collection, but Dead World Resurrection is uniformly good. Very good. Two or three of the stories are slightly disappointing. \u201cBug Out or Hunker Down\u201d is more of a musing of what you would do in a real crisis. \u201cSabbatical in the Ohio Methlands\u201d is also sort of a philosophical tale that strays a little closer to reality. \u201cTwo-and-a-Half-Graves\u201d likewise is more of a personal tale. While these stories are a little weaker than the rest of the collection, none of them are really clunkers and all are well written.\u201cJimmy Finder\u201d is a great zombies versus robots story. \u201cDating in a Dead World\u201d, \u201cThe Day the Music Died\u201d, and \u201cEthical Solution\u201d were among the standouts in the rest of a great collection.Joe McKinney was one of the authors at the forefront of the more recent rise of zombie popularity and he remains one of the best. He understands that you can\u2019t tell a good zombie story without a good story. He creates characters you care about. His characters are challenged physically, mentally, emotionally and morally. It\u2019s the character journey, not just the exciting plots and action scenes, that make these stories stand out.Not all writers are adept at both the long-form novel and the short story, but McKinney clearly proves he is a master of the latter in Dead World Resurrection. This is a great collection both for fans of the series as well as a great entry for those unfamiliar with it. Highly recommended.I was fortunate to receive an advance copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Christopher Payne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990442-christopher-payne", "userReview": "A decade ago, if you'd walked into a bookstore looking for a zombie novel, you would have found only two: Brian Keene's The Rising and Joe McKinney's Dead City.

Eighteen creative and entertaining zombie short stories, a must read for any who is obsessed with the world of zombies. I enjoyed reading all the stories and found that The Readers Guide to the Dead World at the end quite interesting, a sort of behind the scene look at how Joe McKinney came about his stories. Although, all the stories stand alone as fun, twisted little snippets of zombie horror, my favorites were:\"Bury my Heart at Marvin Gardens\" (related to the mother character and her determination to fulfill her husbands unattainable dieing wish, and the challenges she endures.)\"Bug Out or Hunker Down\" (Thought provoking and interesting)\"Bugging Out\" (HAHAHA, Ironic, makes me laugh, Loved it)\"Ethical Solution\" (Great Characters and concept)\"Swallowed\" (Barely 2 pages of pure gore, original)Overall a great book."}, {"userName": "Vickie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/253719-vickie", "userReview": "I expected to like this book, but I was extremely happy to find that I loved this book! I don't always have the best luck with anthologies. Each author having a different way of handling the theme with he individual voices can be jarring. That could, in part, be why this book went so smoothly...one author one voice..no jarring...Really though it's because each story is zombie at heart, but each one is told in a different design. There is zombie future, present, past. Zombies are worldwide, but not necessarily pandemic.Love can be found during the zombie apocalypse, power struggles abound, one story presents a survival guide and a list of supplies.Some of the stories are longer than others, some are only a few pages. They all move quickly.Heartily engrossing and highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Rachelle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8704544-rachelle", "userReview": "I've only recently discovered that I do enjoy reading some zombie books. Still, I'm hesitant to read one as a review book, because of course I hope that I'll love what I read and want to rave about it on Amazon, etc.This turned out to be one of those books! Joe McKinney does an awesome job telling eighteen totally different short stories about zombies, unlike many short story collections, which contain stories that unintentionally have the same voice and same theme, just different characters. My two favorites were \"Resurrecting Mindy\" (excellent choice to reel readers in from the get-go) and Mr. McKinney's speculative essay \"Bug Out or Hunker Down.\"I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Blake Fraina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/860622-blake-fraina", "userReview": "If zombies are your thing, then Joe McKinney is your man.Dead World Resurrection is a compendium of McKinney's zombie-themed short stories previously published elsewhere, plus some \"bonus\" material in the vein of extras one might find on a DVD (an author interview, some \"making of\" essays, etc.). There's a short introduction that suggests, among other things, that the stories are jam-packed with \"...visceral, slimy...gross,\" gore, giving me momentary pause, since that isn't necessarily my thing and I tend to avoid anything too disturbing. Nonetheless, I dove in and, perhaps as a testimony to how commonplace this sort of carnage has become in films, TV and literature, I didn't find the material to be off-putting in the least. That isn\u2019t to say that hardcore horror fans will be disappointed, but I don\u2019t think the average reader would find McKinney\u2019s work too hard to take.The author works in law enforcement in Southern Texas and is able to mine both his professional experience and geographical location for use his writing. Most of the stories take place in Twenty-First Century, with two notable exceptions \u2013 \u201cParadise of the Living Dead\u201d (set during the age of Spanish Conquistadors) and \u201cStarvation Army\u201d (Victorian London) - and they examine many of today\u2019s headline grabbing topics. \u201cThe Crossings\u201d uses a quarantined zone near the Mexican border to examine the complex issues surrounding illegal immigration, as hordes of dispossessed uninfected people trapped there desperately attempt to escape into \u201cFree America.\u201d \u201cTwo and a Half Graves\u201d hints at a series of weather disasters and flooding that hastened spread of the virus, in an obvious nod to the threat of climate change and the lingering national shame of Hurricane Katrina. He also touches on conformity (\u201cResurrecting Mindy\u201d), right vs. left political/social conflict (\u201cEthical Solutions\u201d), Drug Abuse (\u201cSabbatical in the Ohio Methlands\u201d) and class disparities (\u201cStarvation Army\u201d). Like the best horror literature these stories mirror our society\u2019s ills and reflect them back at us through the cracked lens of a zombie apocalypse. McKinney focuses on how his protagonists, much like us, must deal with the cards they\u2019ve been dealt. Overall his writing is solid and masculine. It\u2019s hardly Hemingway, but well-suited for the genre. He\u2019s less successful when he goes for poignancy (\u201cBury My Heart at Marvin Gardens\u201d) or attempts to tell a story from a woman\u2019s viewpoint, but missteps are the exception rather than the rule. His work is infinitely more impactful when he goes for the jugular as opposed to the heartstrings.As for the extra material, it includes author\u2019s notes, a reader\u2019s guide, an interview and an essay/story that explains how he, personally, would deal with a zombie outbreak. I suppose a long-time fan will see this as a plethora of spoils, but it struck me as unnecessary filler. Overall, I enjoyed this collection and would highly recommend it to fans of Richard Matheson, the George Romero oeuvre, 28 Days Later and/or The Walking Dead."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1730701-jamie", "userReview": "I have to say that finding a new author to follow is always a treat. That being said, this is not the first work of Mr. McKinney's that I have read. I actually stumbled (shambled?) across his work about a year or so ago when I took advantage of an Amazon.com promotion to get one of his ebooks for a low price. I have to say I have found some real gems by doing this on the other hand I have found some ,while trying this method,that are not at all worth the time and effort to download. Fortunately, Mr. McKinney's work is squarely placed in the former category and not the latter. He spends time fleshing out his characters and makes them matter. Now on to the review of this particular collection. I really enjoyed revisiting Dead World in these stories. While some of the characters are ones regular readers of the series will be familiar with others are new and interesting additions to this world. Each story in the collection brings you squarely into the Dead World and I found each story entertaining. While some are perhaps more thought provoking than others, all are solid entries into the series and genre. Overall, it was perfect reading for this last week when it has been rainy, cold and wet. It brought closer to home the privations the survivors in the quarantine zone would be going through.I have to say though that my favorite part of the entire collection is the author's story notes. The background behind the stories and the Reader's Guide to the Dead World brought me up to date on parts of the story I had missed and also gave me some more background on the series as well as guidance on the chronology of the series. Thanks Mr. McKinney for giving me the chills so effectively!"}, {"userName": "Mindy Magee", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20221015-mindy-magee", "userReview": "Let's face it, zombies have had their heyday and are on the wane. They've gone from being an esoteric area of genre fiction into a mainstream trope, thanks to the meteoric rise of their popularity in the past few years. I've been a fan of zombie fiction for years (I was zombie when zombie wasn't cool?) and have read every piece of zombie fiction I can get my hands on, but even I've gotten a little weary of the topic. It takes something special to stand out in the zombie arena these days, and although I enjoy Joe McKinney's work, I have to admit I wasn't expecting much from this collection of zombie short stories. I thought maybe I was going to read a collection of leftovers, scenes and shorts that had been cut from previous novels. I was pleasantly surprised. McKinney has managed to make zombies seem fresh and new again (fresh- a word not often associated with zombies) and without trying too hard. In this collection of stories he doesn't reach too far beyond the traditional zombie themes, but it feels creative nonetheless. Although I thought some were better than others, that assessment is more a matter of personal taste rather than quality of storytelling or writing. If you're a zombie fan, and particularly if you're a McKinney fan, this collection is worth a look."}, {"userName": "Chad Huckabaa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527064-chad-huckabaa", "userReview": "This book of short and flash fiction has one subject - zombies and I'll say this, Joe McKinney knows zombies.

Because this book is short stories I'm going to review each separate story as I read it. Resurrecting mindy: I really liked this story. I felt it would have been better if it was actually more than a short story. It really intrigued me and I didn't want it to end. It ended kind of abruptly but I liked that about it. Dating in Dead World: I didn't like this one very much. I felt it really had nothing to do with zombies and that it was very random. Not a good story to me.Bug Out of Hunker Down: I didn't really have feelings about this one. It wasn't bad. It wasn't very good. I liked the beginning and I thought I was going to like the whole thing but the middle and end just didn't do it for me. I wish it would've had a little bit more clear ending.Bury My Heart At Marvin Gardens: this was pretty good. I really like the monopoly concept and the fact that it actually included zombies. I also liked the meaning that it had. Zombies and Their Haunts: lame.The Day the Music Died: honesty this was kind of messed up but I really liked it!! I wish it was longer! Very unique concept I think. Not the normal whole zombie outbreak caused by a virus or something. Nice.Survivors: I really liked this story. It was actually about zombies and not some other weird story line and it had a good meaning to it. It was really kind of sad though.Suburbia of the Dead: don't talk about your personal life in a story like that. The Crossing: I really enjoyed the beginning and once again wasn't so fond of the ending. Regardless, it was one of the better ones so far. Paradise of the Living Dead: kinda stupid I thought. Bad ending. No explanation. Names were confusing. Jimmy Finder: such a good story. It had a very unique story line and it actually had a real ending which was nice. One of the better ones by far. Bugging Out: oh gosh. So gross! But it was good. I like that they brought an actual human problem into it. Something that when the time comes certain people will have to think about. Ethical Solutions: I'm starting to see a pattern. Good ideas. Good beginnings. Mediocre endings. This story was just that. Swallowed: nasty. Sabbatical in the Ohio methlands: I like that it was a new take on \"zombies\" but that's just weird. Two and a half graves: kinda pointless to me Starvation Army: it was a good short short but i felt the zombie thing didn't fit right. It wouldve made more sense if they were ghosts or something. State of the Union: very good story. It sort of made me feel bad for the gut though. Times are hard man. That's it!

I have read many of his books over the years (complete stories) and was always compelled to read each one he has written. I am not one to read short stories because they tend to have no character building, plot twist, and a decent ending. As with most collections of this type, there are some that are excellent and some not so much. McKinney tends to work within a limitation and produces a whole series of unexpected twists that are so unpredictable that by the end of the stories, I was ready for some more.There were a couple of his short pieces that I felt were downright boring and could have been left out. Then there are others that I felt would have been great to see if he expanded on adding new dimension his own work. \"Bury My Heart At Marvin Gardens,\" was an example of a story that I felt stood out and one that I could see expanded to a complete novel. I had particularly liked the way it flowed, like an actual game of Monopoly and riding the streets of Atlantic City during the zombie apocalypse.Overall, good work in writing these short stories.

But, I've decided to stop wasting my time and money on Mr. McKinneys books and look elsewhere. This set of short stories was so, I don't know, not subpar, and not exactly boring, though I struggled to finish it. I guess they were just regular. Nothing new, just the same old, same old. I love zombies because they scare the crap out of me. Fast or slow, it doesn't matter, because they are absolutely relentless. If you're in or out of shape, who cares? They will get you! Mostly, I just love zombies because out of all the monster's out there, they are the ones who will kill you and leave you as a walking meat bag. WITH NO SOUL! That's terrifying to me! In this collection of stories, I found a few of those, but I also found a lot of social commentary. I don't give a puddle about social this or that.
