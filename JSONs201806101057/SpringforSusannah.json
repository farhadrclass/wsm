Some books are so engrossing, it\u2019s easy to stay put for 3+ hours. And some books are so enjoyable you can\u2019t help smiling when you think about the story.\u201cSpring for Susannah\u201d fits that bill for this reader. I think what I loved the most about the novel, were the characters. Yes\u2026all books have to have characters, but Susannah and Jesse were so loveable and completely charmed my heart- Jesse especially. Talk about a loveable hero! Susannah had so much growth to do and started out the book as a very meek heroine, but my goodness as the story progressed you saw HER progressing. The author trusted her reader to get it and I loved seeing the little subtleties all through the story that crescendoed into a character that could stand on her own two feet.I sat in one place until this book was finished and I never once tired of reading. I snorted and giggled over the little bits of humor that added spice. The secondary characters are the perfect mix of level-headedness and quirky. I hope if there are more books we get more of them!A sweet faith message, a loving romance and characters I won\u2019t soon forget, this historical romance is that perfect antidote for cold days, the kind you want to curl up with and become lost within the pages.This review is my honest opinion.

Upon her arrival, Dakota is nothing like she expects. Even worse, marriage demands far more than she expected. Shy and wounded, she believes Jesse could never lover her.Jesse is patient with Susannah, waiting until she learns to love him. They grow to love each other. Then a locust plague wipes out their crop. With few options left, Jesse leaves to find work in the growing towns. Somehow he ends up in Fort Lincoln, and things continue to get worse. Will Susannah and Jesse ever be able to rekindle their new found love?I initially found myself excited about this book. My excitement, however, soon diminished as I began to read the book. I'm not sure if it's the author's voice or the writing itself, but I found this book a very hard read. It became entirely too confusing at times. The proportion in this novel proved to be an issue. Some scenes were so fast-paced, jumping from one location to the next--or from one action to the next--that it became near impossible to discern what was taking place or even form a solid idea of the story itself. Some events needed to be slow-placed to build important tension, yet they were glossed over some much so that one had to wonder what just took place.The dialogue lent much confusion as well. At times it became difficult to know who was speaking as character reactions and actions had been placed with the wrong dialogue.The conflict itself seemed too devised and unnatural, almost forced. Arguments often sprung out of nowhere, the heroine's past hurt didn't seem to justify her current state of mind, and it seemed like the stakes were never high enough to make me understand the true conflict.I wish I could have enjoyed this story, but overall, I found it very difficult to do so.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher, through Bookneeze, for the purpose of providing an honest review of the material."}, {"userName": "Bluerose's  Heart", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3723392-bluerose-s-heart", "userReview": "After Susannah's parents died, she was almost killed by a man. To escape, she agreed to marry a man she had never met, although they had been exchanging letters. Jesse had been lving alone for awhile, so he welcomed his new bride, even though she's not quite what he had in mind. Spring for Susannah is the story of how they grow to know each other and live during tough times. I loved that Susannah is not your typical leading lady. She's 30, very shy and described as plain and skinny. I found it refreshing to read about just a normal girl. Jesse is very talkative, which I found humorous. Catherine actually has humor, almost discreetly, sprinkled throughout the book. I laughed out loud on several occasions! Since this is a story of newlyweds learning about each other, I don't really recommend it to younger readers. Although there's no details at all, I don't think some of the scenes are appropriate for younger, unmarried readers. I loved reading Spring for Susannah, and I will definitely be keeping an eye out for Catherine's future books!!!

One of my favorite type of historical fiction books to read. I\u2019ve always loved reading about two people marrying, though never knowing or seeing each other beforehand, and learning how to live and love each other. And that was the story that Catharine Richmond brought to readers with her debut novel, Spring for Susannah.The personalities of Susannah and Jesse were great\u2014opposites in just about every way, they made a great team. Almost instantly I liked Jesse\u2019s talkative and gentle way that he handled the sudden marriage to Susannah. He didn\u2019t force her and when he learned of the attempted rape, he was willing to give her the space and time she needed. She\u2019d never been loved, so Jesse saw to it that she knew what it was liked to be loved and treasured as a wife. A very sweet guy. I didn\u2019t warm to Susannah as much as I\u2019d have liked. In the beginning, the way she was so reserved and withdrawn towards Jesse, when he really tried hard to put her at ease, was a little annoying. Even after they consummated the marriage she was standoffish and unwilling to admit her feelings for him. She got better towards the end, and I was glad of it!I really loved the first half of the book, reading about the first few months together. I found it easy to keep reading and stayed up until the wee hours. A lot of sweet moments as Susannah opened herself to Jesse\u2019s gentle love. I admit that sometimes I had to stop and reread portions to understand what had just happened\u2014events often happened so fast and with little or no explanation that I was left wondering what was going on. And the first \u2018fight\u2019 between Jesse and Susannah seemed really unnatural and forced. It just didn\u2019t flow. When I reached the halfway point, two things happened\u2014Jesse left and I started losing interest in the book. I\u2019m not sure why, but I didn\u2019t like it when he left to try to find work. The whole thing was rather sudden and extreme. Sure, Jesse wanted to provide for her\u2026but he left her alone on their homestead. My interest caught back on when Jesse was finally able to head for home, though. Very sweet reunion.The writing was pretty well done. There were a few times that the actions or emotions of Jesse or Susannah were a bit forced or abrupt, but not much. As you can imagine, there is a lot of adult content in regards to their marriage life\u2014they consummate their marriage, but the chapter stops before going into too much detail. Leading up to the end of that chapter things are pretty intimate between them, but maybe that\u2019s just me. There is one scene when they go to the doctor that I would advise to skip altogether\u2014the doc explains to Jesse ways to avoid getting Susannah pregnant. Besides what I\u2019ve mentioned, it was a sweet love story that I enjoyed.Spring for Susannah is Catharine\u2019s first novel and is descriptive, engaging, and sure to please a wide range of readers. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I found myself rereading the first half of the book\u2014Jesse was a fun character and I loved reading how he handled shy and reserved Susannah. So, all in all, there were areas that I had a few problems with in this book, but I\u2019m glad I read it! ;-) I will definitely be keeping an eye out for future books by this author."}, {"userName": "Charity", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10062643-charity", "userReview": "I\u2019ve written this review over several times, so let\u2019s give it one more go, shall we?What I want from a novel is something to think about, to excite my imagination, and maybe to challenge my viewpoint. I also want to be entertained. I admit, I demand a lot from a novel. I want good writing, characters I can either love or hate (depending on whether we are talking about the villain or the hero), and a story that is about something more than just \u2026 emotions. I love emotion in a good book. I love exploring it. But it kind of needs to be the backbone of a story, rather than at the forefront. For this reason, I do not read straight up romances. Growing up, I was more of a Sherlock Holmes kind of girl than a Jane Austen kind of girl. I ran across this book because I was doing research into what Christian audiences believe is appropriate and non-appropriate within the Christian fiction department. The author and the book title was cited by some as an example of \u201cracy\u201d Christian fiction (which it isn\u2019t, in my mind), but also was on the Christian best-seller list, indicating a general acceptance of it. As a writer, I\u2019m always curious to see how other writers deal with interesting and/or potentially scandalous topics like arranged marriages, so I wanted to read it and see how she chose to handle sex. In these kinds of books, sex is either ignored in an arranged marriage (doesn\u2019t exist) or is exploited for tawdry\u2019s sake (in bodice rippers). Here, it plays a large part in the first three fourths of the plot (hubby wants it, she is afraid) but other than references to Song of Solomon and some playful banter between husband and wife, there\u2019s nothing that I can see that might \u201clead readers\u2019 thought lives astray.\u201d That being said, I have mixed feelings about this book. I lost interest in it midway through when the hero departed and was no longer interacting with the heroine. The entire first half of the book is based around them becoming emotionally and physically intimate with one another after an arranged marriage and a previous trauma in her life, so when Jesse left, my attention started to wander and I found myself skipping huge sections and skim-reading just to reach the last few pages where I knew they would be reunited. I also had a hard time not becoming frustrated with both main characters, because a lot of their decisions are completely irrational. I know that it was intentionally written that way, but there were pages where I wanted to shake both of them. Overall, for what it is, and the genre it is marketed in (prairie romance), it\u2019s a good book. Just not to my particular taste."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/369732-michelle", "userReview": "Riveting! That's the best word I can think of to describe this novel. I loved how each chapter began with an unspoken thought that Jesse had regarding his wife. That was so well done because it increased my anticipation of each chapter's contents and gave a hint at the lesson that would be learned by the characters. Have you ever wondered how in the world people survived the winter on the frontier with little to no humanity around them and so much snow that they were holed up in soddies for days at a time? Well, this story gives you a glimpse into that life. It also tosses in a bit about the Lakota Indian tribe and the PTSD suffered by many men who served and survived the Civil War. There were many excellent thoughts about a number of situations slipped into this novel that make you think as you enjoy the story. I have always enjoyed Mail-Order-bride-type stories, but this one was uniquely different from the typical format and incredibly well-done. Susannah had a lot of baggage, but she was likable and a very believable character. I totally adored her husband, Jesse. He had pride and the desire to protect and provide for his family like a typical man, but he was also a spiritual leader and an emotional healer in her life. He showed her what true love was, and I enjoyed experiencing their relationship as it grew stronger and finally bloomed. This story was written so naturally in regards to the sexual relationship and the spiritual growth in their individual lives and marriage that they seemed like real people to me, even friends. Oftentimes these elements in a story feel a bit forced. Not in this book. I never would have guessed this story was a debut novel. The writing was beautiful and in some ways reminded me of a Laura Frantz novel. If you love her writing, you will definitely enjoy this book. It was refreshingly realistic and I got a lot out of the story on a personal level. I even found myself smiling as Susannah discovered some spiritual truths and learned to be honest with God. That's a good Christian novel...one that not only inspires you to be a better person, but one that encourages spiritual growth and being honest with yourself. Wonderful, wonderful story. It's definitely a favorite of mine for 2011. Don't miss this one if you want an inspiring read this year."}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4881034-courtney", "userReview": "Such a great romantic debut novel!! I was really impressed by the story of Spring for Susannah! I LOVE stories about mail-order brides and this one was great! Unlike other mail-order brides stories I've read this one the main hero and heroine were sort of set-up by a mutual person. The hero Jesse has a minister brother, and Jesse gets lonely and asks his brother if he knows anyone looking to be a bride? So then the minister thinks the quiet shy girl Susannah who just lost her parents and needs a husband is a perfect match for Jesse and that's how they end up together!What's different about this Christian Romance than most is the couple gets married before they even meet each other and then they fall in love later instead of the other way around! Susannah is terribly shy and has dealt with some horrible things in her past so she has a hard time opening up to Jesse even though Jesse is everything one could want in a mate!I really loved this story! I could really relate to Susannah because I am a shy person myself and find I related to her inner voice a lot. Susannah kept telling herself she shouldn't do this and he wouldn't like her if she said that and so on and it reminded me of myself! There was so much to love about the hero Jesse. He isn't perfect and has dealt with some pretty hard trials in his life but he places a lot of faith in God and does everything he can to get Susannah to open up to him. I loved his teasing and flirting with Susannah.Some people gave a negative comment about the bedroom scenes but I personally enjoyed them. They were married and I thought the flirting and teasing just made them seem more like a realistic character and marriage then other books but I do think some people might not like that sort of talk.My only complaint of the book is the ending. There was so many things going on and I wish they would have gotten to the ending way sooner than they did and I also wish there was more after the ending! It's hard to word exactly what I felt was lacking in the ending without spoiling the book!I can't wait to read more by Catherine Richmond because I'm sure her writing will just continue to get better!A Big Thank You to Litfuse for providing a review copy of the book.

At the urging of the minister's wife, Susannah has corresponded with Jesse for several months, but meeting in letters is nothing like meeting in person. Susannah is quiet and shy, a stark contrast to Jesse's outgoing personality. She doesn't know what to talk to him about or how, and is often more comfortable talking to the dog. He is less threatening than this man who seems to overpower her sometimes just by his mere presence. And he is so confident about God and God's love. How can anyone be that confident? Before her father died, Susannah helped him in his veterinary practice in Detroit, and that experience helps save Jesse's ox and twin calves. She also helps neighboring farmers with their animals, and Jesse realizes that she is an asset and a blessing in this land that challenges the strongest of men and women. For her part, Susannah starts to feel a part of this desolate land and begins to appreciate what made Jesse come out here to homestead. While it is harsh and stark with many challenges, the Dakota prairie is beautiful in spring. As Susannah works through her awkwardness and feelings of unworthiness the bond that unites these two people grows stronger. This is a beautifully written story with language and descriptions that bring the prairie to life like the sun brings new growth in the spring. The characters are true and believable, and the testimony to faith is woven seamlessly throughout the story with a deft hand. As Susannah learns to trust the love of Jesse, she learns to trust in the love of God.This is a book that will appeal to fans of inspirational fiction, but it also has a wider appeal because of the strength of the love story."}, {"userName": "Abbie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4270443-abbie", "userReview": "Susannah becomes a mail order bride due to the fact her parents are dead and she was attacked by a man.

I was not disappointed. I had trouble putting it down. I loved how this book explains homesteading and I felt the author did a great job of bring the time period to life. The characters came to life for me and had lots of depth and felt real. I have read a few books about mail order brides and this book took the time to explore how such a relationship could develop and I really found myself drawn to this couple. This is a Christian Romance but the author did deal some with the sexual relationship. It was clean but pushed the limit enough that some people might be a little uncomfortable with a few of the scenes but nothing that would warrant not reading it. I found myself at the end of the book hoping for a sequel for some of the side characters we got to know.

This was a beautiful love story. I could relate to Susannah more than I would like to admit. Her background has made her doubt her worth and the possibility that she could ever find real love. She has a lot of fears controlling her. As the book progresses you get to know what an intelligent and talented woman she truly is and we can appreciate her nearly as much as Jesse does.Jesse. I don't know that I can totally capture him for you. It's almost like trying to put lightning in a bottle. He's kind and patient but he's also carefree and energetic. His enthusiasm for life and for their marriage catches Susannah totally off guard and she doesn't know how to trust him. I loved that he was a red-head - it fit his personality perfectly.She also has a host of other characters. My favorites were their neighbors, Ivar and Marta Vold. They're Norwegian and good friends to the couple as they go through the ups and downs of life in the territory. Ivar has almost as big a sense of humor as he does honor. He loves how Jesse seems to have a verse for every situation. Marta is newer in the territory and doesn't learn English until after Susannah comes and helps her learn. One of my favorite parts of the book was reading Jesse's short prayers that head each chapter. This is just the kind of thing that gives you insight into the character. The author does a great job handling tricky issues like the roles of women, prejudice against foreigners, overcoming your past, and what genuine faith looks like. She does it all without sounding preachy either. This doesn't read like a first book and I can't wait to read her next one.

Written with a sweet and open sense of honesty, Spring for Susannah is the story of a timid woman who has to learn to use everything she's been given to survive, and the man who loves her enough to encourage her to grow into the confident woman she can be.Jesse Mason is a man who longs for companionship. He can't seem to stop talking and singing, giving him an unusual but irresistible charm. His experiences in the Civil War still haunt him, but he's still a man with vision and lots of love to share. His short prayers at the beginning of each chapter are heartfelt, and I love that Richmond offers the readers this endearing and authentic glimpse into his character.His bride, Susannah, has a shy personality that clashes with Jesse's outgoing ways. Until Susannah finally starts to break free and live wholeheartedly - with a heart that \"beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things\" (1 Corinthians 13:7).Spring for Susannah is a story full of history, romance, and vitality.

Richmond has mastered the art of a character driven story that is rich in content and depth. It was an effortless task to welcome these characters into my heart. Susannah's character instantly endeared herself to me and I became her champion throughout the boo. As Susannah found the courage and will to slowly chip away at the wall of social expectation that she had barricaded herself behind, I cheered her on with each small victory and step forward. Beneath the shy and self-conscious facade, a confident, intelligent and lighthearted woman awaited liberation. Thanks in part to Catherine's inclusion of excerpts from Jesse's prayers at the beginning of each chapter, Jesse utterly charmed me from the beginning. His strength of character and devotion to his family was never put on, but a genuine reflection of who he was as a man of God. The complexities of Jesse and Susannah's situation and frailty of their relationship propel this story towards a satisfying and genuine conclusion.

I don't think Christian Fiction needs this amount of detail; it's not important to create a moving story. It also took me a long time to warm up to Susannah; but in the end she felt like a friend I would have liked to have. Something happened after Jesse set off to find work; the story came un-glued.

I was caught up in Susannah's life as she headed out to the Dakota Territory to meet her husband, a perfect stranger.

At first I was frustrated but after finishing the book I saw that Susannah really needed that time to find herself, her strength and the courage to become the wife Jesse needed and the child of God she deeply longed to be.NOTE: this book, unlike many Christian Romance novels, is NOT recommended for young girls. There are a lot of sexual references in it. Nothing too dirty but more than would be appropriate for teenage girls."}, {"userName": "Wendy Hines", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4997255-wendy-hines", "userReview": "For a debut novel, Catherine Richmond blazes out into the christian romance scene with a fantastic book. The main characters, Susannah and Jesse are very likable and their characters develop and grow as the story unfolds. The story of mail order bride Susannah and her husband Jesse is the basis for the story and for the most part, it is about building the foundation for their marriage. God does play a part in their life but for a christian novel, the bedroom scenes could have had less detail. Sometimes less is more. Also, the ending was rushed, which I wish more time had been spent there. I was left satisfied but yet still hungry. All in all though, a great read and I will be anticipating Catherine's next novel."}, {"userName": "Sheenamy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52606626-sheenamy", "userReview": "Was war denn das?
