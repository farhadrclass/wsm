After a run of bad luck and a chance encounter with a classmate from high school, Alexander leaves Singapore for Berlin, where he winds up in the hospital after suffering from a seizure of some kind during a game. It seems Bruno has a nearly inoperable tumor and only a doctor in the US can do the operation, a doctor that lives near Bruno's former classmate.I got this from Netgalley.My only other exposure to Jonathan Lethem was Gun, With Occasional Music. When I saw this up on Netgalley, I decided to give it a shot.A Gambler's Anatomy is a delightfully odd and wonderfully written book. Bruno's voyage into self-discovery is painful, grotesque, and somewhat sweet at times. Jonathan Lethem is very talented, phenomenally so, in some instances. I caught my mouth watering a few times at his descriptions of food and Bruno's surgery made my face hurt. His word play, use of allusions, and descriptive skills were dead on in this one. I have no complaints of any sort about the writing.The characters were quirky but not unrealistically so. Stolarsky referring to Bruno as Flashman was pretty accurate since Bruno does a few Flashman style things in this one, including not really improving much despite everything he experienced.The plot was secondary to everything else, which is the one ding I'll lay upon the book. Bruno was a passive lead, for the most part. There really wasn't much of a build toward a decisive ending. The antagonist just gave up and Bruno wound up back where he started. I know the journey is supposed to be more important than the destination in most books of this type but it would be nice if the journey wasn't a huge circle. Four out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"Not everything needed to rise to converge: It could just drift together into the indiscernible middle, and bewilder you.\" - Jonathan Letham, A Gambler's AnatomyThe more I read of Jonathan Lethem, the more difficult it becomes to separate him from Michael Chabon. They seem like literary twins writing around the same hipster Brooklyn/Berkeley geography. This novel seems grown from Pynchon, Hesse, Carey, Dostoevsky, Dumas, Leroux, Nabokov, Mann, and of course Chabon.I probably sound more irritated than I am, it just seriously is odd to read a book that centers around a hipster shop on Telegraph Avenue, written by a Jewish writer, born in the early 60s, who loves comic books, vinyl, flowery prose, etc., and discover it wasn't Telegraph Avenue. Perhaps, I should just accept that when I buy Lethem, I might get Chabon and when I buy Chabon, I might get Lethem and move on. At this point, I'm pretty good with prose, but if you did the Pepsi/Coke challenge with me on Chabon/Lethem, I'm screwed.The plot was interesting, the prose was above average, yet the book wasn't nearly Lethem's best I'm still not pissed about reading it. There WAS something there. It was good. The chapter told from the perspective of the brain surgeon (Dr. Noah Behringer, a Hendrix obscessed \"mechanic of the meat\") was one of my favorites and might just have earned the book an extra star all on its own. Obviously, this novel doesn't approach Dostoevsky's The Gambler, Nabokov's King, Queen, Knave, Hesse's The Glass Bead Game, or Carey's Oscar and Lucinda in terms of literary writing about games, chance, love, and life; but if you are seeking interesting hipster dialogue and the occasional kinky scene that includes a mask, well, buy the book and keep your Eyes Wide Shut and one hand on your wallet and you other hand on your pills."}, {"userName": "\u2618Misericordia\u2618  \u26a1\u03df\u26a1\u03df\u26a1\u26c8   \u2742\u2764\u2763", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia", "userReview": "A DNF of sorts.

This, my first Jonathan Lethem novel, was decidedly interesting yet eclectic. It was full of twists & turns as well as obscure references to historical, literary and film characters. I felt that this book was in a genre the opposite of \u201cchick-lit.\u201d It seemed geared toward men, focused on men, devoid of emotion. The women in this novel were there ministering to the needs of the men. It is about games, identity, masks, power, sex. Relationships lacked any depth within this strange book which is full of smoke and mirrors, self identity crises, puppetry, and a feeling of unreality.This is a novel about a handsome backgammon hustler, Bruno, who helps empty the pockets of the wealthy with the assistance of his handler, Falk, who arranges these meetings. One night in Singapore, he encounters a high school acquaintance who takes it upon himself to learn backgammon and challenge Bruno to a match. This is about the same time that Bruno notices the \u201cblot\u201d in his vision. Of course, \u201cblot\u201d is also a backgammon term meaning, \u201ca man exposed by being placed alone on a point and therefore able to be taken by the other player\u201d making this a double entendre. This is the beginning of Bruno\u2019s losing streak and ultimate diagnosis of a facial tumor which is causing the blot in his vision. There is a surgeon in San Francisco, Noah Behringer, who will operate and Stolarsky agrees to pay all costs. Thus, Bruno, penniless and at the mercy of others, is brought to Berkley, his hometown, a place he vowed he would never return.Once the surgery is completed, Bruno feels naked without the blot and requests a mask. This is reminiscent of his last backgammon game during which a young woman serving food came in wearing a mask and was naked from the waist down. The gambler felt that he could communicate telepathically earlier in his life and the blot had helped to protect him from this unwanted gift. Now that the blot is gone, he feels he is exposed again (that his telepathy has returned) and wants the blot back. He feels that he was present during the surgery and remembers all that happened. In fact, that is the only chapter which is told not from the gambler\u2019s perspective but from that of the surgeon, almost as if he was inside the surgeon\u2019s head at the time of surgery watching it happen, a very clever twist of story-telling.The gambler becomes a pawn of Stolarsky\u2019s. Having no money of his own, he is living in an apartment within a building Sturgeon owns. He must wear clothing that he purchases at the store Stolarsky owns, so ends up dressed in \u201cAbide\u201d clothing. He is told to work at Kropotke\u2019s burgers where he is made to wear a burlap mask with a noose around his neck. Bruno, as a character, seems like a pawn in a game other people are controlling, either Falk (his handler) or Stolarsky, at this particular interval in his life.Madchen is a beautiful blond he met on a ferry when he was headed to Berlin. She was also the masked woman naked from the waist down who served sandwiches during his backgammon match in Berlin. She is the only person who tries to contact him during his time in Berkley, as he seems to have no close friends or family. When she is flown out by Stolarsky, she also becomes another piece in a game that Stolarsky seems to be playing, against Bruno and the anarchists with whom Bruno has taken up.This novel is full of double entendres, irony, wit, intellectualism. It is enticing, thought-provoking and strange. For those who enjoy this type of novel, it will be dearly loved. It is definitely not main-stream. It is off the beaten path, odd, but brilliantly written. Thanks to netgalley and Doubleday books for an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.For discussion questions, please see http://www.book-chatter.com/?p=733."}, {"userName": "Ron Charles", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles", "userReview": "Jonathan Lethem\u2019s new novel combines a little of the intrigue of James Bond with all the sexiness of backgammon.

It's odd but this character is interesting but uninterested. Bruno's lack of engagement makes for a disappointing center from which we experience an otherwise compelling group of characters and settings. I was reminded of reading Eric Clapton's autobiography in which fascinating people and times are recounted by a seemingly bored individual. The writing and the peripheral characters makes this book absolutely worth the read. Bruno is A professional backgammon player a game which Lethem describes as being, \"unlike chess: No genius could foresee 12 or 30 moves in advance. Each backgammon position was its own absolute and present circumstance, faded to be revised, impossible to falsify. Each role of the dice created a new such circumstance\".Lethem continues to show the ability to mine meaning and convey it. The book is worth reading. It may be that I was such a fan of his early work that I'm being a little stingy and exacting in this review. I never considered abandoning this book, I just wanted Bruno to be as interested in his fate as I was.Lethem makes fascinating references in all his books.

Is it a mass behind which we create an identity? Or is it our actual identity? What happens when the face is radically changed?In \u201cA Gambler\u2019s Anatomy\u201d, Alexander Bruno is a professional backgammon player, telepathic, debonair and mysterious, expertly relieving the wealthy and egotistical- frequently one and the same-of their money. \"Relieving such men of their pretensions: Those were Bruno's services.\" We first meet him in Berlin, where he has fled from Singapore in an effort to escape financial and personal disaster, including an escape from his \"sponsor\", Edgar Falk. \"Falk conducted an invisible orchestra of graft; his mantra was 'price of doing business.'...Falk stayed behind to settle affairs and collect debts. Falk always collected debts.\"Bruno is suffering a blot in his visual range which he considers part of his persona until he collapses, finds himself in a Berlin hospital and discovers he has a tumor. The tumor is caught between the casing of his brain and his face and is generally inoperable. He is told that the only physician who would be willing to attempt to remove his tumor is in San Francisco, Bruno's hometown. Penniless at this point, his now wealthy high school friend, Keith Stolarsky, arranges to fly him home and provide temporarily for his medical and living needs.Dr. Behringer is an eccentric neurosurgeon who specializes in the removal of tumors that other physicians will not consider. Behringer is bearded, unorthodox and listens to Jimi Hendrix during his surgeries, engaging in sex talk with his staff while winding down his intricate surgeries. His plan for Bruno is to remove his handsome face, extricate the tumor and put his face back. The surgery is ultimately a success.While Bruno travels back to San Francisco and during his recovery from the surgery, he flashes back to his childhood in California and to his days in Singapore. His mother was effectively homeless and Bruno practically raised himself. He recalled a month spent in the burn unit of a hospital when he was 11 and his jobs in restaurants beginning in seventh grade. Ultimately Bruno finds himself in London and then Singapore--a professional gambler. His gambling life in Singapore was a rousing success until it wasn't!His relationship with Keith Stolarsky and his time back in San Francisco is challenging. Stolarsky is a narcissistic, ego maniacal real estate magnate, hated by all who come in contact with him. Stolarsky owns almost all of Telegraph Avenue, including Zodiac Media, Zombie Burger and the Jack London apartments, where Bruno is temporarily housed. Bruno is completely dependent on him for food, clothing, medical bills and everything else. In fact, Bruno's entire wardrobe, consisting of tee shirts with the word Abide (The Big Lebowski) and sweat pants are courtesy of the Zodiac. Stolarsky's motives for helping Bruno are less than clear. Their relationship is very like a complex game of chess, with Bruno always one move behind. Ultimately Bruno's life on Telegraph Avenue comes to an end and he finds himself back in Singapore with Falk, doing what he does best and reflecting on life, concluding the \"We're all Unknown Tragics on this bus\".The story is typical Lethem- cynical and irreverent, focused on the off beat, counter cultural community and its disaffected alienated sociopaths, and filled with various literary and media references, strange and sometimes incoherent sentences, yet enjoyable all the same. Lethem still hasn't captured the magic of \"Motherless Brooklyn\", but \"A Gambler's Anatomy\" is one of his better novels since that 1999 gem. The novel will be released in October.

Oh, and he also has a massive cranial tumor sitting just behind his face.This is Alexander Bruno, the protagonist of Jonathan Lethem\u2019s \u201cA Gambler\u2019s Anatomy\u201d (Doubleday, $27.95). It\u2019s a sprawling story, rendered in Lethem\u2019s typically mesmerizing prose, that explores the realities of the human condition by way of someone who has largely separated himself from his fellow man.Bruno makes his living as one of the world\u2019s preeminent backgammon gamblers. He travels from major city to major city all over the world, playing games against obscenely wealthy men who are willing to spend thousands for the opportunity to take down one of the best. For a long time, those rich players largely fail to do so.But something is wrong.His game is not what it once was. A strange obstruction of his vision \u2013 he calls it his \u201cblot\u201d \u2013 has resulted in real difficulty seeing the board. Nor is he able to harness the long-shelved telepathic powers so prominent in his youth. He has taken some serious hits \u2013 so many that it is unclear if his longtime backer will remain in his corner.In an effort to restore his bankroll \u2013 as well as his dignity \u2013 he agrees to a high-stakes game with a bombastic German real estate speculator. However, his condition leaves him in less than optimal playing shape. His collapse at the backgammon board is soon matched by an actual physical collapse \u2013 a seizure that leaves him helpless and bloodied on the German\u2019s floor. At the hospital, he learns that the steadily-growing blot is a symptom of a massive, messy tumor spreading gelatinously through the inner workings of his face.A chance encounter with an old acquaintance from his high school days back in Berkeley leads to an opportunity; a shopworn, Hendrix-loving hippie surgeon whose entire career has been building to this moment. Bruno hasn\u2019t got much hope, but what hope he has stems from this one-of-a-kind physician.This means a return to his youthful stomping grounds, a trip back to the place he had walked away from years prior. His old friend is now a real-estate magnate, the sort of greed-driven boogeyman that is often anathema in such radical and liberal surroundings.Bruno has little choice but to be swept up into a world that, while vaguely familiar, is nothing like the place he remembered. Nor does it resemble the sphere in which he has been operating. Life has changed for Alexander Bruno \u2013 he\u2019s left making choices and picking sides in circumstances that he doesn\u2019t fully understand.Lethem is one of those writers who rarely wastes a word. There\u2019s an easy complexity to the sentences he spins, creating oddly incongruent and effective descriptions and conversations that leap from the page; as per usual, the risk of literary contagion from Lethem\u2019s prose is exceedingly high. His words linger. Even as the specificity fades, the impression remains strong.\u201cA Gambler\u2019s Anatomy\u201d is no different. Alexander Bruno is a classic Lethem outlier, one whose gifts, while undeniably impressive, have caused him to pull away into an insular isolation. When that bubble pops, when Bruno is forced to allow others access\u2026that\u2019s when the author cracks his knuckles and really gets down to business.Exploring interpersonal dynamics is something that Lethem has always done masterfully. The relationships between Bruno and those around him \u2013 friends, foes and those in between \u2013 are rendered with powerful detail. As a character study, it\u2019s magnificent \u2013 we get to venture into Alexander Bruno\u2019s head both figuratively and literally. We bear witness to the quirks and foibles of a man whose life may be ruined by the very same things that save it.This book might not have the narrative oomph inherent to some of Lethem\u2019s other work; the story sometimes wanders and loses focus. That said, it\u2019s still very much a worthwhile read. There are some tonal shifts \u2013 there an occasional noir vibe, some cold and clinical moments, a few dalliances into the speculative \u2013 that might seem a bit odd to those unfamiliar with Lethem\u2019s oeuvre, but those (like me) already in the bag will have no problem embracing them.\u201cA Gambler\u2019s Anatomy\u201d is a thoughtful and wonderfully-crafted work, one built on an authorial foundation of intelligence, curiosity and immense skill. It\u2019s the sort of reading experience that is very much worth a roll of the dice."}, {"userName": "Leo Walsh", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh", "userReview": "Masks. We all wear them. We all show the world one thing, which is often opposite to what we feel inside. Is the attempt to keep things hidden bad? Indeed, places like WikiLeaks make us think so. Their stated purpose is \"exposing secrets\" of powerful organizations, regardless the cost. Which sounds good, and idealistic. Until you stumble upon the question, \"What if the Nazi's got the US's plans for the nuclear bomb?\" And the answer becomes not so clear-cut. Or are these masks, these little white lies, constructive? One may even call them necessary. Like a FaceBook post where you post a happy picture of you and your spouse on an afternoon where your spatting. Or the police withholding details of a case that they can use to trap the killer.Are those lies bad? Or are they, at least in some sense, good because they lead to positive outcomes? Such are the questions Jonathan Lethem explores in his newest book \"A Gambler's Anatomy.\"After a slow start, we trace professional backgammon player Alexander Bruno as he falls ill, and then falls from grace. The illness is caused by a benign tumor. Once removed, Bruno fancies that he is able to read minds, an innate talent he claims to have had since he was a child. He despises the power, since it makes him different than the others. In his own mind, the tumor was his body's natural protection against being swamped by other's thoughts. So to replace that protection, he takes to wearing masks. Is the mask necessary? Despite numerous attempts to read from and project thoughts into other people's minds, we see no evidence that Bruno has this power save his own assertions. After reaching bottom, Bruno taps a former high school friend, the boisterous carnival barker Stolarsky, whose amassed a fortune by being a master manipulator. For instance, he owns a lot real estate around Cal Berkeley, and owns a popular, profitable burger joint that sounds like a Hooters without the booze. But to play to the 'other side,' he owns the seedy alternative, run by a Marxist anarchist, on the sly. So he grabs mainstream people with one hand, and stokes dissent. And then profits from the dissent as well. Sort of how Motown records would record and profit off of songs advocating controversial civil rights topics, like \"Ball of Confusion\" by the Temptations on one hand. And yet recorded and profited off of Pat Boone, a conservative Christian who opposed the civil rights movement in the early 70's. As expected, Stolarsky plays Bruno and gets what he wants. And Bruno remains clueless. Which again begs the question, \"Could he read minds? And does he even need the mask as protection?\"True to a real artist, Lethem does not answer these questions. And though it often feels like a genre piece -- I detected hints of William Gibson in Stolarsky, and HG Wells' \"Invisible Man\" while Bruno hid behind the mask -- Lethem avoids the common. Since everything he mixes in, from the alleged telepathy to the mask to the radical politics to the comic book references, seems at a double purpose. Like, for instance, the question of whether the telepathy real or imagined. And because of this very conscious artistry, which is successfully carried off, I class \"A Gambler's Anatomy\" as kin to lesser Pynchons, like \"Mason & Dixon.\"I'm giving this four stars, though in reality it's probably a three-and-a-half star book rounded up. Because it does start off slow, and only takes off during Bruno's surgery, where we see behind the eyes of the surgeon Doctor Behringer, who calls himself a \"mechanic of meat.\" I think many readers would ditch it before then.

I pounced upon the book eagerly enough once the opportunity presented itself, though\u2014for while my to-read pile is often tall and tottering, there's always room on it for another Lethem.A Gambler's Anatomy is almost too literal a title for this one, though. Alexander Bruno is a gambler, urbane and smooth-tongued, a professional backgammon player (and no, I didn't know there was such a thing) who travels the world fleecing rich, arrogant \"whales\" for a living. And yes, his anatomy has begun to fail him... an impenetrable \"blot,\" as Bruno calls it, has grown to occupy the center of his visual field, forcing him to look sidelong at things when he cares to look at them at all.Bruno doesn't need to see the board in front of him to play, of course, not at his level of expertise\u2014but even so, the blot has begun to affect his game...In several distinct ways, A Gambler's Anatomy seemed not so much a pure Jonathan Lethem book (whatever that's supposed to mean; Lethem is one of the least predictable novelists I've ever encountered) as an amalgam of Lethem with another Jonathan: Jonathan Carroll. Carroll makes his home in Austria and often sets his stories there, not terribly far from this novel's opening scenes in Germany. Alexander Bruno's elegant rootlessness is a trait that Carroll's characters often exhibit as well. And the admixture of the surreal and the mundane that is practically Carroll's trademark, while subtle here at first, gathers force as Bruno returns (or, rather, is required to return) to his home town: San Francisco, that most elegant and European of American cities.If A Gambler's Anatomy really is Lethem doing Carroll, he does it well\u2014several times, I put it down after a chapter only to pick it right back up again to read the next\u2014but there was also a certain aimlessness about this novel that I haven't found to be typical of either author. Some fairly significant events happen to Bruno, to be sure, but he always seems more acted upon than an actor in his own right.Perhaps that was Lethem's point, or part of it: will Bruno ever seize the dice to throw for his own destiny? Or will he continue to be swept to and fro by manipulative others and the vagaries of blind Fortune?There's really only one good way to tell..."}, {"userName": "Dorothy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy", "userReview": "This book has been published in the U.K. with the title The Blot, which actually seems a much better title than A Gambler's Anatomy. In backgammon, which is the preferred game of the main character in the book, a \"blot\" is a piece that stands alone, vulnerable to attack. Alexander Bruno, the main character, adopts that term to refer to something that has gone horribly awry with his anatomy. There is something growing in his head, between his eye and his brain. Something that shouldn't be there.It is a tumor, and when we meet Bruno for the first time, in Berlin, that unnatural growth is just about to land him in the hospital after he suffers a kind of seizure while he is playing a high stakes game of backgammon.Bruno is a professional gambler. He travels the world, winning large sums of money from rich amateurs who are sure that they have what it takes to beat this professional. He has been inordinately successful for a long time, but then, in Singapore, his luck turns. Suddenly, he is losing more than he is winning.He moves on to Berlin where he hopes for a turnaround in his run of luck, but, instead, the losing continues. And then his health fails. The doctors at the hospital in Berlin diagnose his problem, but are not equipped to treat it. He learns that perhaps the only neurosurgeon in the world who may be willing to try to rid him of his unwanted \"blot\" is in Berkeley, California, where he grew up. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the money to get to Berkeley.But, luckily, Bruno has an acquaintance from high school days, who now just happens to be in Berlin, and who is filthy rich. He offers to pay Bruno's way and to pay for the medical care he needs once he gets to Berkeley. Soon enough, he is back in California, undergoing major surgery that involves rebuilding his face after removing the tumor. He emerges with a face that he cannot recognize and he takes to wearing a surgical mask after his bandages come off. No one on Telegraph Avenue where he lives seems very surprised or put off by the man wearing the mask. In fact, he fits right in there.Jonathan Lethem is an extraordinarily inventive writer who turns out exuberant prose that is steeped in a sardonic wit. In Alexander Bruno, he has created what should be a riveting character and yet he just seemed flat to me. I couldn't really care that much about him. He gives the impression of floating through life, on the kindness of strangers, without any real passion of his own. True, he is obsessive about backgammon and rather smug about his mastery of it, but he doesn't appear to see much beyond that. He didn't really engage my interest as a reader.When I sat down to write this review, I had the oddest sensation. I realized that even though I had just finished the book the night before, I couldn't really remember how it ended. I reread the last chapter and, quite honestly, I still don't know how it ended. Perhaps that tells you everything you need to know about my reading experience with it."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10501996-michael", "userReview": "A new disappointment from one of my favorite writers. To be fair, I was entertained and sometimes fascinated despite myself due to the sheer quality and focus of Lethem's writing however pointless it may be. The characters have gimmicky misfit identities and the story reels from one thinly strung plot point to the next. Lethem's still a great stylist with some funny dialogue and description, but I couldn't feel anything about these characters especially the main one. There's so little sense of him that being asked to indulge his heartbreaking backstory just kind of made me roll my eyes. Like a lot of self absorbed people, he's fascinating at a distance but dull up close. The ones that work best are the minor characters that if cartoony are at least entertaining. \"Mad respect\" to an anarchist slider cook.

Made it about 30 pages in. Lethem has become one of our Great American Writers, but in doing so lost that punk edge that made his earlier novels and short stories and experiments (and even some of his more recent essays) sing.

A \u201cblot\u201d is also the term used in backgammon for a piece that stands alone, vulnerable to attack. The parallels are obvious, as indeed are most of the tropes and metaphors in this long rambling novel. There\u2019s no real plot apart from Alexander Bruno\u2019s protracted struggle with his \u201cblot\u201d and although the first half of the book is entertaining and enjoyable, with some wonderful set-pieces (Bruno\u2019s brain surgery is quite unforgettable) towards the end it all descends into a rather bizarre and unsatisfactory muddle of strange characters and less than convincing episodes.

I usually enjoy Jonathan Lethem\u2019s books, and I thought this would be the case again, as the beginning of the novel looked really promising.

It's maybe the most Murakamiesque Lethem I've read?If you haven't already read Lethem, I think Motherless Brooklyn is the best full novel, I think the first two thirds of Fortress of Solitude is his best writing, and Gun With Occasional Music maintains a soft spot in my heart because it was first."}, {"userName": "M.L.

Fronted by his pasty, vampiric manager, Edgar Falk, Bruno arrives in Berlin after a troubling run of bad luck in Singapore. Perhaps it was the chance encounter with his crass childhood acquaintance Keith Stolarsky and his smoldering girlfriend Tira Harpaz. Or perhaps it was the emergence of a blot that distorts his vision so he has to look at the board sideways.Things don't go much better in Berlin. Bruno's flirtation with Madchen, the striking blonde he meets on the ferry, is inconclusive; the game at the unsettling Herr Kohler's mansion goes awry as his blot grows worse; he passes out and is sent to the local hospital, where he is given an extremely depressing diagnosis. Having run through Falk's money, Bruno turns to Stolarsky, who, for reasons of his own, agrees to fly Bruno to Berkeley, and to pay for the experimental surgery that might save his life.Berkeley, where Bruno discovered his psychic abilities, and to which he vowed never to return. Amidst the patchouli flashbacks and Anarchist gambits of the local scene, between Tira's come-ons and Keith's machinations, Bruno confronts two existential questions: Is the gambler being played by life?
