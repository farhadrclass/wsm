But it was so short (they're all novellas) and so good, that I had to read the rest! Deadlocked starts off as your average zombie apocolypse story - although you learn pretty early on that the virus may have been may have been brought on intentionally as an act of bio-terrorism. I found the mystery to be exciting and thrilling - especially considering I could totally see see this happening in our world today! But of course, my favorite part were the...ZOMBIES!When it comes to the disgusting, man-eating creatures, A.R. Wise does not disappoint! His zombies move a little faster than others I've read about, they can walk underwater, and change within a matter of hours after death. It was great! LOL. Their ruthless pursuit of flesh makes every moment terrifying. Even as you read, you want to make the characters hurry up and you practically want to shout at them! And speaking of the characters - I loved them all - every single one. There are only a handful that last throughout all four novellas and I love that Wise was not afraid to kill some of our favorites - it made the story all the more realistic. The character of Laura, a mom desperately trying to make sure her kids stay safe, is the most bad-ass character I've read in a long while. She lives through some crazy painful experiences just to keep her children from turning into zombies. Her risk-taking courage is actually quite inspiring. 5 out of 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Tabatha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12373776-tabatha", "userReview": "As with the first one, I Could not put this book down!

It is great to get the behind the scenes perspective on the story.I have my own emotional reaction which is....I like it enough to want to continue learning about the fate of each character. My thoughts and perspective on this series is there is a lot of planning that went into the storyline. The writing is very lean. A lot of \"she said\" for describing the dialog. I was always told never to use that word, but I'm not taking away any points in my opinion on the overall story. In conclusion if you're interested in reading about a unique zombie apocalypse. Give this series a try.

Book 1 follows David as the main character in his attempt to find his wife and daughter in the beginning of a very new zombie outbreak. We meet up with Laura and the girls, Kim and Annie, at the end of book 1. That installment ends with David\u2019s ultimate sacrifice for his family. Picking up with book 2, we switch to Laura\u2019s point of view as she watches her husband's sacrifice and realizes that she too is willing to do anything for her girls. Laura\u2019s story is extremely intense and emotional even more so than David\u2019s was. Laura does things in this book that blew me away. Whatever it takes. Not only does she have to protect her daughters from zombies, but also, even more so in this book, from the remaining human populace that\u2019s seemingly lost all of their morals. Survival of the fittest abounds\u2014kill or be killed. And despite rooting for the main characters, I saw the logic in a lot of the arguments from the other humans they ran into. The couple they came across on the boat\u2026while I agree that the husband was a bit of a DB, he had some good points. Same thing with the \u201ccops\u201d who need to feed the masses they\u2019ve assembled. Normal rules of \"what\u2019s mine is mine and what\u2019s your\u2019s is your\u2019s\" just do not apply anymore. It\u2019s more like \"what\u2019s your\u2019s is mine as long as I can take it from you.\" Despite being a short book, AR Wise packed Deadlocked 2 with more action and story than some books 5 times the size, and I\u2019m excitedly looking forward to continuing the story with Billy\u2019s point of view in book 3. AR Wise yet again added an author\u2019s note to the end of this book. And on the one hand, it could easily come off as boasting how he describes all of his writing \u201ctricks\u201d\u2014I can\u2019t think of a better word there\u2014such as mirroring the scene where David jumps into the water and being pulled under by zombies from book 1 to Laura\u2019s scene in the water being pulled under by a shark, and how everything ties in together. And maybe I\u2019m just dense, but I didn\u2019t pick up on everything he explained in the author\u2019s note while reading the book, so it actually made the book that much better for me (I did get the similarities of the specific scene I mentioned with the water though\u2014I\u2019m not that dense). So I\u2019m torn between thinking it would have been better for AR Wise to let the reader discover all of this themselves, and feeling like he\u2019s just so excited about his story that he can\u2019t help but share as much of the story and the process as he can. Plus as I said, I didn\u2019t pick up on all of the things he discussed in the author\u2019s note, so I\u2019m happy to know them now. They enrich the story. All in all, Deadlocked 2 gets 4 Stars from me. If you're looking for a quick, intense read involving zombies, it doesn't get much better than the Deadlocked series. Have you read Deadlocked 2? What did you think? Let me know!"}, {"userName": "chucklesthescot", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426724-chucklesthescot", "userReview": "After the shocking end of book one which I loved, we pick up from where we left off. So if you haven't read the first Deadlocked book and plan to at some point, it would be a good idea not to read on with this review as I'm going to talk about the end of that book which is the start of this one!Laura becomes the narrator of the book after the death of her husband David, who died with Billy's father to allow them time to escape in their boat. Now Billy aims to look after Laura and her daughters Kim and Annie and get them somewhere safe until they can decide what to do next. After trying to help rather ungrateful survivors, they have a run in with would be thieves who are dressed as cops. What they find out is that the food that David and Laura took from the school is contaminated and anything eaten raw could infect them. Billy is determined to head into the city to see if his mother survived the attack, leaving a worried Laura hidden on the boat with the girls, watching in fear as Annie starts to exhibit signs of infection. Laura knows that there is a cure but it means leaving the girls alone and heading alone into the city to find a pharmacy.This wasn't as good as the original story and I did find certain aspects of it a bit far fetched. The journey down the river was pretty darn bizarre and each event seemed to get crazier as we went along. I didn't think that she or Billy showed a lot of common sense or did much to keep the girls safe! Still, it was entertaining enough for me to decide to go on and read the next book, which covers Billy's adventures in the city. That is a bit annoying after the cliffhanger end to book two, so we need to wait to book four to see what happens to the girls.Overall, I'm a bit concerned about where the book is going plot wise. I like Laura and Billy as characters, but this seemed to be less about the zombie outbreak than we saw in the first book and starting on the road towards government conspiracy or bioweapons gone wrong or something like that. Still, we'll see what happens next."}, {"userName": "Ren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1533037-ren", "userReview": "[they passed underneath the suicide bridge, I rooted as Laura swung the baseball bat, swore when those fucks from earlier sent the \"police\" after them, and even came come to tears by the end.

Wise, and I love this series. Each book has left me breathless, and wanting to know what happens next. Deadlocked 2, starts off right where Deadlocked leaves off. We follow Laura, in her journey as she is still grieving the loss of her husband, David. We see that in the beginning she is a timid scared woman. But she quickly realizes that her daughters survival and her own depends on souly her. She steps up her game, and becomes a Mama Bear. Willing to do whatever it takes to ensure her little girls safety even if it means sacrificing herself. . I love the developing relationship between her and Billy. I do not believe it was ever meant to be a romantic relationship, it's the type of relationship that I think anybody fighting for their lives together would build. They quickly become a small family unit, willing to do whatever to protect what they have. Their bantor between each other is often times comical, and I found myself laughing at loud lots of times. Again, one of my favorite parts of these books are the Authors notes. I have quickly come to appreciate them, and I wish more authors would include these into their books too. I love getting to know Wise's motives, and train of thought. This makes it to where I am not wondering around aimlessly after reading these books wondering why in the hell would the author do something like that!? He answers all of our questions at the end of each book, and leads us into the next one. High Five to A.R. Wise for this! And as an advide reader, I thank him! I really do not think you will be disappointed in these books, I think even if you aren't into the Zombie genre, this series will make you change your mind! There is lots of zombie action, but on top of that this book, all of these books have depth and structure, plot, and awesome characters making it so much more than Zombie horde gallore. Off to the next book!!!"}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "As soon as I finished the first Deadlocked novella I immediately went and bought the next 3 in the series, and book 5 as soon as it was available. I love a good, hardcore zombie tale, and this is a series that definitely hasn't disappointed me so far.After the first novella in which David witnesses the beginning of the zombie outbreak and goes through every terror imaginable to resuce his wife and young daughters, the perspective shifts to that of his wife, Laura. As she fights to protect her daughters not just from the undead but the humans that are starting to take advantage of other survivors, she endures some pretty hairy situations, but never gives up on her goal.To put it simply, Deadlocked 2 is the story of the incredible lengths a mother will go to in order to protect her child. Emotional, action-packed and perfectly gory, Deadlocked 2 is the perfect example of how a zombie novella can really work - the characterisation is perfectly balanced with the zombies, and at the end, I couldn't wait to get to the next installment.Deadlocked is a series that I truly enjoy and highly recommend to any zombie lovers, or even as a first foray into the world of the walking dead!Read more of my reviews at The Aussie Zombie"}, {"userName": "The Digital Ink  Spot", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7493592-the-digital-ink-spot", "userReview": "Deadlocked 2 starts right where Deadlocked left off. David's wife, Laura is in momma bear mode and is doing what she has to do to protect her children and the things she does are off the charts. I am surprised by the lengths Laura will go to stay alive. She is a real fighter is putting it lightlyI loved the first book and this was even better than the first. It is a great story unto itself but it also adds to the over all story arc created by Wise in this four part series. I have the third part on my To Read List on Goodreads. What we learn in this 2nd story is that the zombie apocalypse is not by accident. (when is it ever) Laura stumbles across a couple of men who say they know what is behind this mayhem. How she handles those men is pretty hardcore.The amazing thing and one reason why I like Wise's writing is because he gives insight to his characters and how they cope with death and killing. They change and the characters are aware of the changes in themselves. It's refreshing to find an author who writes in this genre and writes well.This book and this series is well worth your time."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6556991-holly", "userReview": "Um, can you say DISGUSTING? This book had me getting a bit queasy at times. Blech! True zombie horror to the max! What I loved about this book aside from the horror factor, was the extreme protectiveness of a mother to do whatever it takes to protect her children. Even when that means putting herself in danger. That's real life and the author captured the essence of that aspect of motherhood very well in this story.You want blood and guts and flesh eating? This book has it! You want a story about survival and how the drive for self preservation affects humans, for the good and the bad? This book has that too!Favorite quotes:\"I was the only hope she had of a cure. If I stayed here, she would die, and so I forced myself to stand.\"\"There was nothing left of the humble, kind, timid woman that I'd been that morning. I'd become something else entirely.\"4.5 stars for the sheer terror and gross factors alone!

I was given a copy of Deadlocked from the author for a review.The second book in this series starts off right where the first one ended. Only this time the mother Laura is the one fighting for her daughters lives. Laura is a very strong person mentally and physically. She fights the dead as well as the living to keep her family safe. She is one tough woman with all that she has to endure to protect her daughters. Talk about motherly love this woman definitely loves her family.I loved the fact that Laura always stood her ground and that she wasn't afraid to fight. She didn't run off and hide and then start screaming like most females do in horror movies. I mean you know like most of the girls in horror movies will go and hide under the bed.

The zombie apocalypse continues to allow the crazy's to come out of the wood work, not sure how they manage but they do. Now it is up to Laura to keep the family together. She's powered by adrenaline, grief, Oxycontin and the fundamental instinct to protect her children. Wise believes that women characters are, more often that not, not portrayed as real women probably would be in these situations. I find it very refreshing when a strong willed stand alone female protagonists hit my ear, there should be more.

Everything moves fast and there is no pause to take a deep breath.As they travel through the river, with plenty of supplies stolen from a school they meet several people. Again the same thing as before. Not everyone is a nice as they are and best of all - the change that the writer did to Laura throughout 70 pages was quite good.

This is great, gory, visceral zombie action. No one is safe, not even the cute little kids or the puppy dog. The author throws everything at this family, including the kitchen sink, it seems. There are the typical bad guys disguised as good guys, sharks, exploding bridges, a really bad case of PMS, and Mom pulling an almost-Mike Tyson maneuver on a zombie herself.
