I am also a friend and family member who has had first-hand experience with the conflict that occurs when faith collides with an illness that is difficult, if not impossible, to understand/explain/treat/cure. As such, I found this book invaluable. The author poignantly depicts the effects of this illness on his own life as well as the lives of his family and friends. He is brutally honest, as well as thoughtful and thorough. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to honestly understand this illness and it's effects.

The style is very poetic, yet very raw. He masterfully describes what it is like to live with bipolar disorder - and further to be surrounded by loved ones with the disorder. David's life is not one that any of us would want to live, but I found him to be a compassionate individual with a wonderful heart and an astoundingly clear knowledge of his issues. He fights bravely, if not always wisely, against his demons. I would certainly recommend this book to all, but especially to those with a relative or friend with bipolar disorder.

My mother worked at the seminary where Richard Lovelace was a professor and Jonathan was a grade ahead of me.

I remember his best friend being hounded on the bus for having a \"nutcase\" for a friend. So, finding this book was amazing since everything hapened in a time where no one talked openly about bipolar disorder, especially in blue-blooded Hamilton.

They're completely unbelievable, poorly written or just bad. Scattershot was definitely *not* one of those books for me. Though the subject matter is sad and it's sometimes tragic, it's never unbelievable, as the author weaves in all those feelings we all have with family - tenderness, guilt, duty, love, and coming to terms with the faults and \"isms\" of our families. I was very pleasantly surprised by this memoir. It's funny and touching at the same time and well written throughout. That written, not everyone will enjoy this book. Those who are not intrigued by psychology or mental illness will not relate to Lovelace and may not finish. Subjects include family, mental illness, bi-polar, depression, the author's struggle with BPD and his \"recovery,\" and watching helplessly as it overcomes his family members.

I highly recommend it to anyone connected to mental illness, especially bipolar. I have to say though, after such in-depth descriptions about the lifelong breakdowns of not only himself, but his mother, his father, AND his brother who all have bipolar disorder as well, I can't believe he spoke so flippantly about his decision to have children. I guess he didn't have to consider the fact that women can't take mood stabilizers like lithium while pregnant without risk to the fetus, because after a whole book of terrible stories about their mental illness and the hell it put their family through, he seems to suggest that the availability of medicine makes it a negligible risk. That didn't sit right with me at all. Altogether, I loved his stories and his writing style.

She told me she had credit and was willing to buy me whatever I wanted - this was part of my haul. The book only came with the title and headline, and a few reviews on the back; there was no summary to give me an idea of what to expect, beyond \"My Bipolar Family.\" I decided to purchase it because several members of my family, including myself, have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (and several other diagnosis.) I am very happy I purchased this book. The family portrayed is haunted by mental disorders - each person who suffers, suffers severely. Mrs. Lovelace has severe postpartum depressions that last for years, and religious paranoia. Mr. Lovelace is bedridden for years due to depression, and his feverish manias fuel religious hymns. The eldest son switches from bedridden and unable to feed himself to a man so manic he rearranges his friends' whole apartment. The youngest son follows a similar inactive depression, yet his mania is anger fueled and he makes a cape and beats the shit out of a neighbor. Good stuff. I'd like to note that not every case or every family with several cases is so haunted by mental illness - this is a family with a very bad genetic lottery.It was interesting to see how the eldest son, the author, was influenced by his father's illness. His father fell ill before the two sons, and as he experienced his first mania, David began to realize what his illness really could entail. I felt I could really, really identify with David's struggles when it came to accepting his disorder - and the many games we play to stop using treatment/justify going off treatment, and the humiliation that occurs when others see us at our \"mad\" moments.I did not agree with all of David's arguments - his struggle with hospitalizing his manic father, for one - I do not think others should have the right to hospitalize someone unless they are going to harm themselves/others (although I am surprised the neglect of his mother at that time did not constitute as \"harm\" and no legal ramifications came of that) but I understood his struggles. The amount of humiliation he felt, that drove him to close his bookstore, seemed an overreaction to me. One manic incident over years and you're done? Also, it was so dangerous when Roberta told him to get off of his meds ... I took issue with that, too. But, those are issues/disagreements with the author, as opposed to criticisms of the book itself.Overall, the writing style was good. At first the opening scenes seem like they may be the craziest of the whole book, but it becomes clear that David's story of his bipolar disorder is not the only thing interesting here - he's led a very interesting life. He bums around South America and squats in New York. I'd suggest this for anyone with a genuine interest in the experience of someone with bipolar disorder, anyone with bipolar disorder, or anyone who wants to read about a punk rock guy with some life struggles. Overall a very good book."}, {"userName": "Aili", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113969-aili", "userReview": "David Lovelace, his father, mother, and younger brother have all been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Only his younger sister seems to have dodged the bullet. But bipolar disorder was not well recognized, nor were there very good treatment options, until the mid-1990s. So David and his family spend years struggling and hurting themselves and each other. This memoir is Lovelace's attempt to educate the lay public about his disorder and to caution his fellow sufferers (and their families) from thinking that they can \"beat\" their diagnosis.Based on the cover and blurbs, I was expecting this to be a rollicking! crazy! time! on the model of  Running with Scissors, but instead this is a sober, personal, and chilling window into the life of someone with a serious psychiatric condition.Lovelace comes from a Christian fundamentalist religious background (his father was a Presbyterian minister; his parents met at a Christian revival summer camp) in which individuals were taught to wrestle with their demons and pray for salvation. As an adult, he rejects religion, tries to self-medicate with various illegal drugs, and eventually wholeheartedly embraces modern psychiatry, though his relationships with lithium and antipsychotics can at best be described as love\u2013hate.Generally Lovelace does an excellent job of owning his life decisions, even though he's made some major mistakes and is frequently narcissistic. That's probably the best thing about the book; phrases like \"unflinching portrayal\" come to mind. His illustration of his family's religious tradition was also pretty fairly presented (given that he has since forsworn it) and informative. I would have liked more insight into his siblings' experiences (for example, his sister avoids bipolar disorder but grows up to be a therapist -- no issues there!), but the author is clearly focused on describing his own lived experience.My only other major criticism is that Lovelace periodically slows down the narrative to discuss the history and characteristics of bipolar disorder; I found these digressions pedantic, but then I have a pretty good working knowledge of current psychiatry and so may not be his target audience.Overall: chilling; quick read; good for those interested in mental health, memoirs, and family dynamics, or to throw at relatives who don't understand psychiatric diagnoses[This isn't out 'til August/September, but I grabbed a free uncorrected copy sent to us at work. \"Bible\" was sometimes uncapitalized.]"}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4481148-sue", "userReview": "This is the kind of book that saying, \"I really liked it,\" makes me feel as if I'm saying, \"I really liked that train wreck.\" The words in the Goodreads rating system just aren't appropriate to the situation, but that's what I've got to work with, so . . . I really liked this book.The author describes in vivid detail what it was like to grow up in a family in which BOTH parents suffer from mental illness -- a genetic legacy that they unwittingly gift to two of their three children, including the author. He also describes as best he can -- and this is the real strength of the narrative for me -- what it feels like to be an intelligent person who, in spite of his intellect and his talents, cannot stop his own descent into madness. (And I would note here that the word \"madness\" is the word the author uses; he states frankly that the term manic-depressive -- which was the diagnostic term used in the 1970's -- is really, in his opinion, a polite term for an utter chaos of the mind, i.e., madness.) And he should know -- the decisions and behavior that he chronicles in this book, both his own and that of his family, are chaotic at best and dangerous at worst.I read this book because I have known and been close to several persons who have suffered from bipolar disorder (though, thankfully, not to this degree) and I wanted to get a better handle on what they as individuals experience when their illness is not well controlled. This book did provide that, and for that I am grateful.My only criticism of the book is that the author does not provide background information about bipolar disorder in general in his book, and that would be useful to the reader, especially the uninitiated reader. Though perhaps, in this age of quick access to information on the Internet, he felt that anyone interested in knowing more about the medical aspect of the disorder could find it.

Except I am sure it all is completely believable to those who have lived with and witnessed bipolar. As Lovelace begins to explain his family history I thought to myself, \"What are the odds that his parents found each other, married, and both have bipolar? I mean really what are the odds? And do his parents truly both have it or does one have something different that looks like it?\" Those were/are just a few questions I had throughout the reading of David's memoir. His family history is a little frightening - on both sides - and it just makes you wonder what the heck happened in the gene pool for all of this to rise to the surface. I don't say that to sound unsympathetic or cold, it's just a curiosity. Lovelace chronicles how bipolar made itself known in the lives of his immediate family. He takes us on a journey of his particular struggle to deny its existence and then finally his resignation to accept it. I think what frustrated me was he knew he was unhealthy and yet did unhealthy things that only made it worse. Almost like inviting disaster. Is this typical of people who have bipolar? It was okay. I felt bored through the middle section of the book. It was David's accounts of his crazy efforts to outrun his family and bipolar. And I wasn't all that fascinated by his efforts, just bored. Maybe it's just me.

It's a very good weaving of the different characters and elements of the family, and you leave with an absolutely clear picture of the family (special thanks to the real-life photo on the cover) and, more importantly, a vivid understanding of what it means to live with biopolar disorder.The author expertly describes his manias and depressions (although, fairly, the manias better), and brings you into his mind, life, and illusions as he's caught in the throes of the disease, pre-medication. Parts are hilarious, parts are heartbreaking, and it's entirely informative and entertaining without ever once becoming sentimental.

And I believed, still believe, that this mania is true, that the scattershot visions of madness are holy. They are also fucking crazy and hopeless and sad.

True visions find their validity in the universal, the spiritual, but these visions are poured into each cooking scull, one at a time. You\u2019ll burn down before you can share them.
