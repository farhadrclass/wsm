He trapped me like a fly in a Brown Recluse Spider web with this one because Wraith is actually a prequel to his outstanding novel NOS4A2. To entice me even further he tells the backstory of the diabolic, Christmasland caretaker, Charles Manx III. Somehow it is so much more stomach churning to think that there were two other Manx\u2019s before this one. Manx drives a Rolls Royce Silver Wraith that is actually a key that takes him through a portal to the place he needs to be. In his case, that generally means he is taken to an abused child who needs to be separated from their parents. Manx induces the child to step into the Wraith and he spirits them away to Christmasland. Are you getting warm and fuzzy feelings? Dispel yourself of them. You know how there are those signs up in towns that proclaim a sister city In Russia, or China, or Thailand? Well if Christmasland is the sister city to Disneyland than Disneyland is in Heaven and Christmasland is in Hell. \nChristmaslandSo if you see this guy...\n...showing up with that car and that license plate.

Like Nosferatu, geddit? Sheesh, what uninspired \u201ccryptic\u201d wordplay. Well, like father, like son, eh Redrum? So I haven\u2019t read NOS4A2 which is why I was quite a bit confused with this book - unless people who have read that novel also found this confusing in which case it was just a mess! Charlie Manx (like Charlie Manson - real imaginative, King Jr!) is a pale, monstrous looking driver of a Rolls-Royce Wraith. He picks up some jailers and their prisoners, takes them to Christmasland for some reason, and then just sort of lets the weird vampiric kids play with them. That\u2019s all, folks!There is a needlessly unpleasant origin story (again, like King Snr!) for Manx, which also reveals him to be a complete moron you couldn\u2019t possibly respect, but it\u2019s unclear just how he came to look so monstrous. He seems to have just been born demonic-looking which is very convenient. Quite how Christmasland came to be is also unclear as is the supernatural Wraith. And the kids as well. Things just happen in this book! What are Manx/the Wraith/Christmasland/the kids\u2019 motives? Why did Manx take the prisoners/jailers to Christmasland in the first place? No idea. Maybe all that\u2019s explained in NOS4A2 even though The Wraith is supposedly a prequel, but the plot is decidedly lacking here. The artist Charles Wilson III does some good work even if some of the character designs are derivative. The kids are wearing My Chemical Romance\u2019s Black Parade era gear for no reason and Manx looks a bit like Sam Lesser from Locke & Key in some panels. Christmasland is so superficially \u201chorror\u201d too. Sad teddy bears, building blocks that spell \u201cDIE\u201d, reindeer with glowing eyes - it\u2019s so corny! It\u2019s lazy creativity that isn\u2019t scary but incredibly bland and stupid. There\u2019s also the least convincing romance ever when the \u201cgood\u201d 30/40-something prisoner and the 60+ year old jailer (whose surname is of course Claiborne because we gotta keep referencing Daddy\u2019s more popular books!) fall in love - my eyes nearly rolled out of my head for that one! If it weren\u2019t for some of Wilson\u2019s art and Jay Fotos\u2019 colours, The Wraith would be a total bust. As it is, it\u2019s just a crap comic, ineptly written and plotted and thoroughly uninteresting.

With The Wraith, Hill delves into Manx\u2019s history, detailing what drove him to become the man he is, the origin of Christmasland while establishing a face to the holly, jolly land of terror.The artistic style of Charles Paul Wilson was very reminiscent of Hill\u2019s long time collaborative partner Gabriel Rodriguez (which of course, is a good thing) \u2013 with whom Hill worked with on the critically acclaimed series Locke & Key. Wilson thanks Rodriguez within the acknowledgements so it\u2019s possible he played a hand in the style chosen.If you liked Hill\u2019s NOS4A2, The Wraith is not to be missed. What could\u2019ve easily been a by-the-numbers expansion of the original material feels like a fresh, interesting story from an author who clearly wasn\u2019t done with his creation.Also posted @ Every Read Thing"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "Wow.

It opens with a little backstory about Charlie Manx, which was just awesome. I totally wanted to know more about the origins of Charlie Manx. It then quickly switches to the main story, involving two prison guards and a group of convicts who are trying to escape. However, their plans quickly go awry and one of the convicts contacts Charlie Manx - someone who is known for helping people disappear. Little do they know they're on their way to Christmasland...My favourite thing about this graphic novel was, of course, the illustrations. They were mind-blowingly awesome. Often I would just sit and stare in a daze. It was literally like Charles Paul Wilson III crawled into my brain and encapsulated exactly how I imagined Christmasland to be and then put it on the pages. It was beautifully creepy and macabre, and so sinister. I'm in love.The story itself was fun, with some intriguing characters. I had initially gone into this thinking it was basically an interpretation of the book, so I was a bit disappointed to not encounter Vic McQueen etc, but it was nice to actually experience a different Charlie Manx-centric story.

It was very seedy but knowing Hill's work, I wasn't surprised that it was... I enjoyed reading this. I didn't enjoy it as you enjoy a good dessert or a sunny afternoon after a long and cold winter but I did like you sometimes enjoy reading about sordid stories in the papers. Because sometimes you want to spend a moment in SickLand. The more accurate would be to say I was a bit hypnotised by it. By all the wicked things going out of Joe Hill's brain. Because that might be a fucking scary place to be!So, not mindblowing for me, but as every Hill stuff, it lets a mark on you, if not in your heart in your guts.

This is Manx's dreamland, to which he takes people in his Wraith, his Rolls. This is a spare tale for back story, so the art takes the stage, and a bloody stage it is. I would say there is not really much more than a story's worth back story here\u2026 and an epilogue, but it feels sort if thin. I mean, his series Locke and Key develops characters and relationships in its horrorscape, and Wraith does less so here; it does give you some back story especially up front and at the end, and that stuff is chilling, but the substance of it, the depth compared to the slashery feels less to me. This feels like batshit crazy horror, and a wild ride, but correct me if I am wrong, but not as rich as some King/Hill horror can be in terms of human depth. I liked it, tuned the pages, read it fast, and it's good horror, and it's visually fun, and Charlie enters the pantheon of horror as a new crazy good character, but it doest yet achieve greatness. Maybe coupled with the novel? But you know, I'm not a real horror fan, not really.

But, in all the best imaginable ways I think.I went into this with some expectations. I have read NOS4A2 and the thought of getting a backstory that focused on Charlie \u201cTalent\u201d Manx III and Christmasland was quite exciting. I also love Joe Hill\u2019s Locke and Key graphic novels, so, easy to assume, I really expected to enjoy this one as well.And well I did. But I also have to admit, it was even creepier than I expected. I know Christmasland is creepy as hell. I know Charlie Manx is creepy as hell. But somehow, seeing someone else\u2019s images of them gave this a little extra creep factor than I would have achieved if left to my own devices. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not professional illustrator! I just don\u2019t know that my imagination can do quite as good of job as this.It was definitely interesting getting Charlie Manx and Christmasland\u2019s origin story. To see Manx before he became what we know him to be in NOS4A2 (a delusional, fanatical sociopath? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a psychiatrist, but something about Manx is crazy and messed up), growing up, getting married, having kids (?!?!). Being relatively close to normal. That is, for a while anyway. Wouldn\u2019t be much of a story otherwise.In addition to Manx\u2019s story, we also get the story of a group of inmates and their guards that were being transported in a van. Well, as you can imagine, things don\u2019t go well for this group. There is one inmate who we get additional backstory on. I really enjoyed this story line. It gave us a bit of sweetness amidst the creepiness.The final chapter in this is done in a completely different style. More text and the images are old school illustration style, not at all the creepy scary stuff we had so far. I was a bit skeptical when I started this section, but actually came around and really enjoyed it as well. And, once again, it gave me something a bit unexpected.So, if you are a fan of Charlie Talent Manx, NOS4A2, creepy Christmasland, or even if you are new to these, and are not deterred by the illustrations, this is one hell of a creeptastic graphic novel and I\u2019d definitely recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Alondra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6130276-alondra", "userReview": "*The most beautiful book ever; nothing like creepy-ass kids to put fear in your heart!!*5 StarsIf you loved NOS4A2, then you will love this graphic novel.

The grindhouse fare is bookmarked first by an extended monologue by Manx which details his humble beginnings, and then by a second-person prose account from the swindler who helped make Christmasland a reality.

Later in life, after suffering crushing disappointments, he regains this world in the form of a creepy amusement park called Christmasland. (Believe me, this place makes anything Tim Burton has dreamed up look like good clean, innocent fun.) Now, as an evil chauffeur, he kidnaps children and takes them to this perverse funhouse, where they are somehow transformed...The main part of the story (originally #2-#6 in the comic miniseries) introduces the reader to a group of convicts and their two prison guards. An attempted escape gone wrong lands them in Christmasland - a place very definitely worse than jail. Surprisingly effective, complex characterization mixes with bloody gore and nastiness...The epilogue is presented as more of an illustrated story than in full graphic format. It circles 'round to the beginning again, telling the story of the con man who unthinkingly destroyed Charlie Manx's life. It was actually my favorite part of the story - although all of it was pretty good. I wasn't sure if I was going to read NOS4A2 or not, because funhouse/holiday/clown horror isn't really my genre - but after reading this, I'm sold. I'll get the book!Just a note - so far, of Joe Hill's work, I've read 'Heart-Shaped Box' and seen the film version of 'Horns.' Both, I felt, weren't particularly Stephen King-esque.
