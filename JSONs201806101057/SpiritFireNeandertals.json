Stott, and let me just say: Bravo! Well done! \u201cSpirit Fire: Neandertals Book Two\u201d is the second book in the three part Neandertal saga, and it does not disappoint. Stott has once again provided a captivating, interesting and well-written read. However, now that I've gushed about how great this book is, I suppose I should provide some information about it. *chuckle*In \u201cSpirit Fire: Neandertals Book Two,\u201d Stott continues on with his fictional tale set in prehistoric time. Due to prior treachery, trickery and deception, Cro-Magnons discover war, thanks to two men: Warlog and Rayloc. Warlog desires revenge, (under the guise of justice), as well as ultimate power, whereas Rayloc simply craves power.Neandertals are about to become the unfortunate victims of war because of their physical appearance, coupled with their connection to the world around them. They can see farther, smell better and are much stronger than their distant Cro-Magnon relations. Neandertals have a better understanding of climate, seasons and nature, and they live in the safety of caves that Mother Earth has provided for them. Some would call their intuition and knowledge, magic...Unfortunately for the Neandertals, aka Earth People, the Cro-Magnons have a legend about an evil god, Dracolut, who sends cave-dwelling droglits out into the world to trick the people with magic. Once all the people are tricked, Dracolut will remove the sun from the sky; casting the world into eternal darkness. In Warlog's fervor to control all the villages, both known and unknown, he discovers the Earth People. And, encouraged by Rayloc, Warlog sets out to eradicate all of the Earth People, as well as any Sun People who might help them.The above is all that I will provide. If you enjoy this genre, might I suggest that you get your own copy of \u201cSpirit Fire: Neandertals Book Two.\u201d (You will not be disappointed.)In summary, \u201cSpirit Fire: Neandertals Book Two\u201d was a fantastic continuation of the Neandertals saga. Stott has successfully brought the many characters forward from \u201cHeart of the Bison,\u201d the first book in this epic adventure. Stott writes with fervor and flair, and leaves the reader anxious for more. Five stars\u2026(Reviewed in association with Rebecca's Reads)."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31925096-blair", "userReview": "Just hold on! The beginning of this book completely threw me for a loop. But just hold on it does get better and it does connect all the information and the characters from book 1 but you do have to wait. The ending of the book was amazing and sad all at the same time... With that being said I'm nervous about reading books in the book to did give a sneak peek at the next book The Heart of the Bison I am just hoping that I will be able to get into the book. Spoiler alert book 3 is set in modern times."}], "description": "It is 3289 BCE when rumors of unusual people living in caves far from his land attract the attention of warrior leader Warlog.
