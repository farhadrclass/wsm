Although he is a lazy, binge drinking journalist, there was a touching part where he saw a dying dog and stopped to help him. Would have LOVED Fin if he'd actually rescued said dog. But he didn't, so he only gets a like from me.Loved learning about Egypt; the culture, food, customs, religion, Cairo, people. But the more I discovered, the more I wouldn't want to visit there. Too harsh, patriarchal and confrontational for my delicate constitution.There's a fab author's note at the end of this novel which describes the events which led to this novel being written. Love stuff like that.Overall very interesting, lots of vile, aggressive, weird characters, especially the ungrateful Forouk, Fin's so called friend, who was so annoying, narrow minded and obnoxious he made me want to reach into the book and punch him. Great bit about Fin in the river Nile (won't elaborate in case I spoil). Found it easy to read. Quite a \"blokey\" read (I know I am losing what slim credibility I might have, saying such a ridiculous, generalising thing). Good book, glad I read it. Although I enjoyed it, sorry to say I was glad to finish it so I could move onto something else more me."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17465866-anne", "userReview": "Our hapless hero Finn, seduced by tales of buried treasure, is dragged into a nightmare adventure around the back alleys of Cairo, in pursuit of his friend Farouk.

I actually can't think of anything positive to write about this book as from the beginning, it was already progressing rather slowly. Heck, perhaps the first page caught my attention, and that was it. Whatever happened after that was just downhill all the way. To be honest, I have no idea what I read. It felt as though there were two stories intertwined in one book, but it was so convoluted and criss-crossing that I'm now not quite sure if one story was more important than the other. For one, Fin (the heavy drinking ex Irish journalist) was so caught up with a story that his friend Farouk had told him about that the other story in the book about Fin's actual life in Cairo and Farouk's abduction almost felt like it only played a supporting role. As if it was secondary to Fin's obsession with the life and times of Skinhead Said. Whoever the hell he was. Seriously. I don't get what Skinhead Said had to do with Fin or Farouk! What was Rowan Somerville trying to prove in his book?The whole thing was just so mind-numbing that it took me forever to finish a not-so-thick book. One that would normally take me less than a month to complete (of course, taking into consideration that I wasn't very free and easy myself). I think I better start reading something else that would keep me at the edge of my bed (and seat at Starbucks). A book that can pry me away from my laptop is actually considered a damn good read."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1302060-bill", "userReview": "This was a fairly entertaining story, but I can't say I really loved it. It's the story of Fin, an Irish journalist living and working in Cairo. Actually not working because he gets fired in the first couple pages. The real appeal of this book for me was the characters, and not even so much Fin as his Egyptian friend Farouk and the other Egyptian guys he encounters. Most amusing among them is Waheed, a cab driver, and Omar, a thug who also owns a kebab restaurant. The continuing issue throughout the story is the tale of Skinhead Said and the treasure he supposedly found beneath his basement after the floor collapsed, and event which we are led to believe is fairly common in Cairo. Farouk, a master story-teller, keeps giving Fin a tantalizing piece of the story, then shooting off on endless tangents, but the tangent stories are often more entertaining than Skinhead's goofy tale. I did actually find the many story sequences throughout the book to be very good, and as I mentioned, many of the Egyptian characters are hilarious. I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it, I just didn't find it as exceptional as all the other reviewers."}, {"userName": "Ria", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/921981-ria", "userReview": "An interesting and in a way surreal story.Fin a boozy, recently out of a job reporter for a Cairo newspaper out of maudling sensitivity reignites a friendship with Farouk whom he met after moving to Cairo.Farouk is a whimsical character and spinner of tales who after a swift purchase of a car at a very low price is accused of and abducted by a man who believes he is the culprit of knocking down his daughter and fleeing the scene.Fin sets out to rescue him and has a series of exotic adventures along the way in his desperation to save his friend Farouk and to hear the end of a tale Farouk has started narrating about the mysterious \"Skinhead Said.\"Is Farouk ALL fin is searching for or is he looking for excitement and freedom from his humdrum life which he believes he can find at the end of Farouk's tale of Said.A mystical tale with exotic ingredients of foreign climes to lend an authentic backdrop to a fascinating story.Well worth reading."}, {"userName": "Matt Kuhns", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14737306-matt-kuhns", "userReview": "Irish writer who once lived in Egypt writes novel about Irish writer living in Egypt, hilarity ensues. And seriously, this was frequently true, particularly during scenes of exceptionally colorful native cursing. I did indeed laugh out loud several times. Otherwise, a well-written novel that meanders in a Twain-like fashion through Cairo society, though it comes up rather empty at the ending. \u201cJourney rather than destination\u201d is kind of a theme for the story itself, anyway, so read it with that in mind."}, {"userName": "Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/447446-stewart", "userReview": "\"The End Of Sleep owes much to the Arabic culture it\u2019s steeped in, preferring to linger more on the journey, and its arabesque narrative, lazily meandering through the day, soon takes control holds on through a crazy, if sometimes conveniently plotted, day in the life story peopled with larger-than-life characters\"Read my full review here."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5858816-jen", "userReview": "Read this book on the recommendation of a review. Set in Egypt, it tells of a period of 2-3 days in the life of Fin, a newspaper man, and Farouk, his Egyptian friend. I suppose it is a kind of cultural awareness/spiritual awakening novel as Fin is forced to accept the differences in viewpoint between his western outlook and the traditional views of local Egyptians. A bit wayward in parts, but some bits were quite funny and other bits hard to piece together. Mixed feelings about this one."}, {"userName": "Ingrid Storm", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16326934-ingrid-storm", "userReview": "\"A riotous love letter to Arab culture\", says the review which is probably the best thing I can say about the book.
