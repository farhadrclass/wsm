Kinsella's passing. It still holds up. There are a couple of 3 star stories, some 4 stars, and some 5 stars. I'll give it 5 in memoriam of Mr. Kinsella."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/439937-jim", "userReview": "W. P. Kinella's enjoyable collection of short humorous stories are narrated by Silas Ermineskin, a young Cree living on a Canadian reserve, as he struggles to understand and explain the lives of his family and friends (especially their relationships with whites), mostly set during the 1970s, revealing much of the racism and poverty experienced by Canadian Indians. The stories are often witty, sharp, and critical. My biggest pause, however, is that they are being told by a nonnative (sympathetic as he may be) in the voice of an Indian, and one wonders if any Crees took offense to Kinsella's representation (especially the speech patterns). Moreover, his justification of theft, murder, vengeance, and lying, as well as spousal cheating, by many of the characters, may be looked upon unkindly by Native Americans. Granted, it is fiction and a writer can make any characters they wish, but it made me hesitate. I fear that racialist views of native Canadians are perpetuated in this work."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29025600-emma", "userReview": "Although I am aware Kinsella has the propensity to create sensationalized portraits the First Nations life, I can't help but love this work, his first. It has a distinct charm and perhaps the best cohesiveness or \"flow\" of any short story collection I've read. Each story is rich with a comedic lightness that balances out the tough matters, without diminishing impact. It was hard to put down and I read it in two sittings."}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1928936-jeff", "userReview": "Does a pretty good job of capturing the humor and pathos of life on an Indian reservation."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69340687-angela", "userReview": "This book did not age well. The way the synopsis was written made it sound like Kinsella was an ally of indigenous people half a century before it was trendy to be an \"ally\":Kinsella refuses to take a tragic (he would call it sentimental) view of Indian life. His view is unrepentantly comic and his stories are extremely funny. Not that he laughs at the expense of the Indians. On the contrary, it is the white man and his civilization that are seen to be absurd. All the stories are told from the point of view of a young Cree man living on an Alberta reserve, and the entire book is written in broken English because he's too stupid to speak the language properly. Most of the stories involve prostitution, violence, drinking, gambling, and crime. I don't see how this can be understood as anything other than a negative portrayal of indigenous people. Some of the stories were interesting; I like how difficult subjects (revenge, death) were written with tact, and the emphasis on the importance of friends and family, but overall this book reeks of cultural appropriation."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27652377-karen", "userReview": "I found this book to be not at all what I expected and mildly disturbing. It is spoken of as being humorous, but I found the stories sad. Sad because of the sorry plight of the American Indian in our society and sad because of the inhuman way people treat one another. Sometimes, I felt like I wanted to stop reading, such was the upsetting nature of some of the things that occurred, but the stories themselves are compelling. Each is a tight knit little adventure with a very definite beginning, middle and ending and some of the endings were quite a surprise and others gave food for thought. I can see how this book has endured all these years and how it has become a cult classic.In retrospect, I have been enlightened and entertained in reading it."}, {"userName": "Alethea Bothwell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23686036-alethea-bothwell", "userReview": "This is one of his collections of native American stories, and at first I was a little put off at a white guy using a native American voice.

All the stories are from the perspective of Silas Ermineskin and though I did take umbrage with the syntactical choices of the author (one which the character explains) I did find myself wondering why most all the Cree in this book talked like Silas. This quibble aside there are funny, poignant and some real gut-punches in this one. After a while the camaraderie of Silas, Frank Fence-post and others takes on an almost Steinbeck-esque level of brotherhood and escapades like how they band together to help Annie in the story Penance. Lark Song is one of the strongest in the collection, rendering the brother Joseph who suffered brain-damage when he was young and never gets any older inside his head. The resistance of the community to send Joseph to a care facility combined with the reality of his situation was well handled by Kinsella and it doesn't leave the reader with any definitive answers. I would have liked to have seen more lyricism that popped up in this story and Between. The handling of the American Indian Movement in The Inaugural Meeting seemed boorish at best and there could have, perhaps, been a much better way to highlight the disconnection between the day-to-day life and life of activists without making the CIA seem like benevolent and benign. The majority of these stories do handle the cultural divide between the Cree and farmers in a way that I've experienced and it is well worth a read for anyone looking for a solid short story collection."}, {"userName": "Kye Alfred Hillig", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1800930-kye-alfred-hillig", "userReview": "I've admired the native American beliefs all my life. This was a great window into how their lives have changed. Kinsella shows us a character whose community has turned somewhat bitter under the foot of the white man. There is an innocence about his character, Silas, that makes you feel the pain of his people and the way that their lives have been perverted. There is an underlying feeling of doom to this novel, like you know that the natives as a people won't survive. It's also interesting to be allowed a view into the native gender roles, which by modern social standards would be labeled sexist. A wonderful and honestly touching novel. I suggest it."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57431683-teresa", "userReview": "This is the second time that I read this book since the mid 1990's. This time I wanted to read it because the book caused a bit of a sensation with the people that live in the First Nations community of Hobbema (now called Maskwacis). I didn't think that it was controversial at all. It had a lot of the truth of living on a reserve. Perhaps if the book was released today instead of so many decades ago, people might have a different attitude now that First Nations concerns are being revealed. Overall, I recommend it as a good read."}, {"userName": "Max", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39779035-max", "userReview": "I've always loved the movie and was thrilled to come across the book. Was I surprised to learn that the movie is based on but a single chapter of the book. No wonder the author didn't like the movie! The stories are so funny and the characters are unforgettable. I know he is not a native writer and there is always the concern of someone telling another culture's stories, but I think the stories are told with such authenticity and love for the characters, I could not help but be won over. A truly great read."}, {"userName": "Lezley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11500657-lezley", "userReview": "I think this book is an important book to read. It's as though a veil hangs between First Nations and the rest of Canada. This book takes you behind the veil of First Nations people. Each story is so poignant it's impossible to continue to the next story. Some time is needed between stories to let them simmer in your mind. It left me feeling that addressing the issues facing First Nations people is endlessly hopeless."}, {"userName": "Valeria Clay", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5105899-valeria-clay", "userReview": "I really liked this book. This collection of short stories depict life on a modern Indian reservation from an Indian perspective. It shows the differences (past and present) and the communication difficulties that occur when interactions occur between two cultures. The narrator is the connecting thread between the various stories. It is a great read, my only complaint is that it wasn't any longer. I could have kept reading."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2900457-jeffrey", "userReview": "I'm really rating this book a 4.5. My single complaint is that it wasn't longer. What made this collection of short stories so enjoyable is that the characters stayed pretty much the same throughout the book, so even though each story was only a handful of pages long, Kinsella is able to really develop the major players in the collection. Perhaps the greatest strength of the book is that it has just one narrator, and his personality ties all the stories together."}, {"userName": "Anna Huynh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5803318-anna-huynh", "userReview": "My sister recommended this book to me saying that it was just as good as Alexie's The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven (a great read, if you haven't) so I had really high expectations for this book. Which is why it was OK. The kind of writing style was used to reflect how the characters spoke, I get it, but it ended up being a distraction for me.
