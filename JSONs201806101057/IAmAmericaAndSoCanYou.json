He makes Ann Coulter, that hateful, Republican attack-hermaphrodite, look like a kindly grandmother. More recently, this lifelong right-winger attempted to subvert and sabotage both the democratic process and the Democratic Party by running as a Democrat for president in the state of South Carolina. Colbert has proven himself, time and again, to be a self-satisfied stooge less concerned with reality than with his ratings and status amongst the Republican elite. His \"logic\" extends to asking such unanswerable non-questions as \"Don't you want to win the war on terror?\" He sees the world in black and white, with no shades of color or gray, and he expects the world to answer to his limited understanding of it. In I Am America (And So Can You), Colbert attempts to translate the uniquely twisted logic of his TV rants into a book of socio-political commentary. That he should write a book is shocking, if for no other reason than its hard to imagine he even reads them. (First sentence of the book: \"I'm no fan of books.\") From the start, his ego is the boat with his partisan agenda at the helm. The introduction is more like an instruction list, guiding the reader in how to \"read\" the book. (Don't highlight anything; it comes with Colbert approved stickers to notate moments of utter worship.) He then proceeds to lecture about the family. As one can expect from the admitted sexist, Colbert's view of the family is right out of the 1850s. As with any political tome, one eventually stumbles upon moments of seeming coherence amid all the partisan stupidity. Colbert may be absolutely correct in his suggestions for dealing with the elderly, and whether one agrees with the end result or not, he does issue the most coherent argument yet provided by the right on why homosexuality is dangerous. Most times, however, Colbert veers toward hysteria. He attempts to make the absurd case that God loves America more than he loves anyone else, and proves it by covering God's involvement in America's foreign wars. He also pushes an agenda of views that could only come from Colbert's deep involvement with the American quack right: abstinence, anti-abortion, the homosexual recruitment agenda (he even gives page space to a testimonial from a religiously \"reformed\" homosexual), and the long-held Christian Conservative view that bears are a vehicle for demons. And of course Colbert misses the irony in his hateful ridicule of actors who promote \"liberal\" causes. He viciously attacks Sean Penn, Tim Robins and Barbra Streisand without even acknowledging that he, with his TV show, brewing publishing empire and Republican connections, is absolutely no different from the celebrity activists he attacks. Overall, a loosely held-together quilt of facts taken out of context, Republican talking points, opinion packaged as news and prejudicial ignorance. And it's not even written very well. Colbert makes up for what he lacks in literacy by inventing whole new words. The result is both accidentally hilarious and utterly confusing, but certainly not literary or substantive. One need go no further than the title to learn that Stephen Colbert is someone who talks first, and thinks later. Expect his show to move to the FOX Network very soon, and expect many, many more books like this.

By the end I realized there was only one: \"I am America by Stephen Colbert.\" What, you ask? I'm saying the whole frickin' thing is quotable! I Am America is hilarious from start to finish. I snorted, I chortled, I laughed so hard I accidentally drooled. This is everything I hoped it would be. I'm glad I finally got around to it. My only quibble is a minor, half-serious one. I worry about the people out there who actually take this seriously. \"Oh that's ridiculous,\" you say, \"no one's stupid enough to take Colbert seriously.\" Wrong. When I was writing for newspapers back in the day, I would occasionally do satirical pieces. They were thinly veiled as such. I didn't want anyone mistaking my sentiments for my true feelings. And yet, some people did. I was astounded. It was a real reality check for me. There are still people in the world that take everything they hear at face value. I fear these people and I fear for these people.

I have no vested interest in American politics. You know what I do have a vested interest in? Funny.Now, I generally find John Stewart funnier and I appreciate Colbert's moronic, dead-pan Republican act. I just can't take it for too long because then my brain starts to hurt.Which was probably my downfall in reading this book. Colbert obviously knew that the schtick was going to get old and so peppered the book with many, many amusing images and captions. As a writer and reviewer, I would never do this.Never!I still struggled after a while. This book really belongs in the hands of a die-hard Liberal American. Those are going to be its readership because they're going to be the ones that enjoy every joke and twisted piece of logic.As for me, meh.

I highly recommend seeing it live! Before the show Stephen takes questions from the audience. Rachel's question was \"what are you reading right now?\" Stephen said \"A Jesuit of Broadway\". Rachel asked \"what is it about?\" Stephen said \"it's about a Jesuit on Broadway\". Stephen then asked Rachel \"what are you reading?\" Rachel stammered \"uh, your book!\" Stephen said \"oh, don't waste your time on that garbage\".We bought this book when it first came out and the beginning was pretty funny. Getting farther in it though, it seems there is a lot of padding. Or perhaps it's just missing something in translation.I'd recommend getting the Book-on-Tape (CD) version. I think it would be a lot funnier actually read by Stephen Colbert.\"Nothing the ladies like more than a big sack. I mean something a cartoon bandit would carry out of a bank.\"Perhaps the best part of the book is the at the very end, the transcript from his address to the White House Correspondents' Dinner.

I listened to this while driving...don't recommend that. It made me laugh too many times, which could have endangered those driving near me. Glad I survived I Am America. The audio book is essentially one long standup/sketch routine. Colbert has done a fine service for America creating the Colbert persona--what's so disturbing is how it is only a slight exaggeration of the right wing Conservatives of America, the Rush Limbaughs, Glenn Becks and Ann Coulters of the world. He slightly revises their actual opinions...to be more honest and straightforward. He outs the subtext; he reveals the barbed wire lining to their cloudy viewpoints. And then throws some extra wacky bits on top of it just for laughs. It's good. At times, I did find myself scared because I felt like many right wingers would listen to this and either 1) agree with it without recognizing the irony, or 2) not think it reflected their party's views when in fact it does. But even while it is terrify to recognize the small-minded bigotry and arrogant selfishness that undergirds the Republican Party (and much of the Democratic party as well), there is still laughter that can and should be had at their expense. The humor arises from a recognition and appreciation that Colbert feels ... just like I (you) do. That is, it's funny because we both recognize that the Emperor wears no clothes even while millions of American's don't. That at least is a wonderful thing.I met Colbert briefly, heard him read with Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello at an indie bookstore in Chicago that no longer exists many years ago upon the release of their very funny novel Wigfield The Can-Do Town That Just May Not. In person, he is rather like his persona--very big and presentational. But of course with the opposite political opinions from his character on the show. He was thoughtful and funny. I raised my hand during the Q&A and asked what he thought it reflected on America that he and Jon Stewart were actually the best sources of news on TV. He made a dry joke, something about...\"You do know we're a comedy show, right?\" which got a laugh. But then he went on to say that it was a sad state of affairs in the world of journalism that TV journalism especially was not about investigating and presenting truths but about trailing the winds of politics.I'm glad there are still a few entertainers out there who find a way to shine a light on what is really going on. It's rather amazing someone so subversive would be allowed to even have a show. Comedy is one route to truth."}, {"userName": "Petertpc", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6720252-petertpc", "userReview": "Some of the time, very funnyMuch of the time, sorta funny to fairly amusing.

In his mind, however, the book is an indispensable work of truth and advice about how to navigate your life. In the directions for how to read the book, Colbert mentions that his book can be used to swear in people about to give testimony in the extraordinary absence of the Bible. This sums up the esteem with which this work should be regarded, according to the author. I Am America (And So Can You!) opens with Colbert\u2019s declaration that he does not like books. He also hopes that his readers have not read any books before, presumably so that their minds will be pure and therefore most receptive to his truth. The 230-page hardcover goes on to reveal Colbert\u2019s wise opinions about such topics as the family, religion, sex and dating, higher education, the media, and science. In each chapter a multi-layered satire of right wing conservative values and points of view are presented in cleverly hysterical detail. The chapter titles easily decant the savory flavor of the book\u2019s humor. (Please don\u2019t add water!) For example the chapter about Sports is called \u201cWhen It\u2019s Okay to Shower With Men\u201d and the chapter on Class War is named \u201cLet Them Buy Cake For A Change.\u201d In addition to the American-as-apple-pie insight imparted by no less than 14 writers, I Am American (And So Can You!) is so fundamentally funny that the actual design of the book often made me laugh. The photography is truly brilliant, both in composition and the acting skill of the subject. Colbert\u2019s distinctive facial expressions and flair for wholesomeness combined wonderfully with a variety of props ranging from a bouquet of flowers to dog poop. My personal favorite is the photograph of Colbert in front of Applebees, where he presumably became disillusioned with life. (I understand). Another nice touch with the book design are the red-dyed edges of the pages, so as to advertise its Biblical quality. I recommend this book to people who do not read books and like to be told how to think by a male authority figure. Studies indicate this would be a large audience, which accounts for the best-selling success of this book."}, {"userName": "Montzalee Wittmann", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32532051-montzalee-wittmann", "userReview": "too funny, rtc"}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/702237-jeff", "userReview": "It's always an experiment when a comedian with no literary history writes (or collaborates to write) a book. Everyone knows that the 80/20 rule even applies to humor: 20% is the joke and 80% is the timing or delivery. With someone like Stephen Colbert - who I have endless respect for after delivering his famous White House Correspondents Dinner speech, which is wisely reprinted in this book - whose humor is predicated on physical, visual humor, it can be quite precarious treading into the waters of a medium that doesn't play well with the 80th percentile of jocularity, and the results show. After spending a few days cruising through this book I felt tired and worn out, not unlike the same mental exhaustion I experienced the last time I played a game with my 5 year-old nephew where the rules were made up on the fly, and seemingly known only to him. Worst of all was the feeling of forlorn, as if the clever, facetious, Democrat-in-sheep's-clothing, comedic juggernaut I had come to admire over many late nights, had decided I wasn't worth the effort to humor. I'm not even going to get into how painfully tedious it was to read all of the comments written in the margins, which were some kind of bastardized version of the genius \"The Word\" segment from Colbert's regular gig.Even if this book fails to do what it set out to accomplish, after the Daily Show's \"America: The Book\", everything similar is doomed to pale in comparison.

Anyway, it had no coherent plot, made not good points, was purposefully inflammatory to homosexuals, liberals, immigrants, and college grads, all at a yell, and all in a vain attempt at humor. I liked the cameos by Amy Sedaris and Jon Stewart, but really, I'm glad this audiobook was only 3 CD's long, bc I made myself soldier on rather than giving up halfway through. I really can't speak for the print version of this book at all, since I feel it really must differ dramatically from the audiobook - a lot of the chapters were read by other people (he calls it a \"full cast of characters\") with accompanying sounds, music, and other effects that really did add to the fairly vapid humor found within the script...So, all in all, watch the Colbert Report, but perhaps this is 3 and 1/2 hours you could spend listening to Madonna or something.

Since Stephen Colbert is one of my favorite celebrities, I did very much enjoy the listen. I listened to it audio knowing that most of Stephen Colbert's comedic humor is the delivery. I found myself laughing out loud a lot. So yes imagine we wandering aisles as I shop or sitting amidst the cheering parents of a soccer game laughing to myself. Colbert has a rare gift of making something funny he doesn't believe in without making it angry or offensive. He mocks many things I believe by arguing for them with the most ridiculous logic and I still laugh and think it's hilarious. His social satire really is genius.But the humor did drag a little. There were times when I wished he'd move onto the next joke. Particularly long were his \"Stephen speaks for me\" characters who rattled on about nothing in particular but made sure to get a sailor's quantity of f-words in there. The thing about Comedy Central is they edit out those f words so I don't have to hear them. If I could skip the other voices, I'd probably give this a 4. Plus I didn't get one crack about bears being a threat to America. I'm disappointed. My favorite segment had to be on parenting, especially his dialogue that women should cater their lives to their children. He even got in Stephen-style praise of Mormonism, which as I explained above is not really praise at all. The first disc was hilarious, the second and third ones slower and not as humorous, but there's still enough wit in there for it to be worth it. Just skip the tracks where Stephen isn't speaking.

Upon its first few viewings I thought that I might not like it as much as \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d but after a little bit of time in warming up to the character of Stephen Colbert, I quite frankly think that \u201cColbert Report\u201d is in many ways the much funnier show. Much to Mr. Colbert\u2019s dismay, I checked this book out from the library and was unable to avail myself to the full extent of its features, such as the various stickers which allow the reader to indicate when they agree with Colbert the most. As one might rightly assume, if you are a big fan of the show, you are likely a big fan of the book. I thought the book was spectacular and the only element missing from the show/character of Stephen Colbert was his incredible interviewing talent, best evidenced on the show in segments like \u201cbetter know a district.\u201d No real surprise that the various quips that Mr. Colbert uses so well on his show are also used to great effect in the book. A few that especially stood out were his belief that baby carrots are trying to make him gay, that the Hundred Years War was a terrible name for a war because you should never set a date for withdrawal, and the idea that sex is like the death penalty with one outcome and so many different ways of carrying it out.

In real life, Colbert is a left-wing-liberal. But on his show, he's completely the opposite. So being a regular watcher of his show, and knowing what most of his opinions already were, I would have gotten more out of this book if it contained the real Stephen Colbert's views on politics, religion, sex and dating, sports, homosexuals, America, Immigrants, etc. (These are all names of some of the chapters.) But it didn't, it just contained his character's views and opinions. So while it was a flat-out hilarious book, it didn't have any other weight, in my opinion. That being said, disregard all of that and read the book. It's really funny, and it shows his comedic genius outside of television.

Our library finally got the new bestsellers collection processed, so I have checked it out. I just started it. * * * *Actually, the book is a bit disappointing. It has its funny moments, but there is a lot of fluff in between the funny parts. It does capture the tone of any pundit book out there, and that may actually work against it as well; pundit books suffer from the problem of just going on too long to make their point. And I think that is the problem with the book: it just goes on too long, and some of the jokes seem to stretch on forever. While I like him on The Colbert Report, Mr. Colbert should probably stick to that. Unless you are a really hardcore fan of the Colbert Nation, you can probably safely skip this book. A lot of it you have already seen it on the show if you watch the show, and the rest is just plain boring."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51395417-brian", "userReview": "\"I am America (and so can you!)\" is a funny satire, if one takes small bites.I would not recommend sitting down and reading this book as your only reading material. If you do that you see that it gets repetitive and some of the jokes are variations of the same theme.However, if you read this book in small bites, maybe reading a chapter at a time every few days, you can appreciate the humor and get a seriously good chuckle out of every chapter.There are some genuinely funny moments in this book, and although it tends to skewer those of us on the right, I took it as an indictment against extremes in all sense of the word.Small bites will yield big laughs and you will put it down no worse for the wear."}, {"userName": "Derrith", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86785-derrith", "userReview": "Not sure why it took me so long to finish this book. I would pick it up, read a bit, put it down and move on to something else. Maybe it's like when you save your Halloween candy and your siblings (who scarfed theirs before their costumes even came off) are jealous when you still have a Snickers fun size with your lunch well into December. Now that I'm done, and my sides ache from laughing, I'm glad I doled it out to myself in small doses. It was less about savoring and more about the fact that Stephen Colbert, in large amounts, much like your Halloween candy, can give you a stomach ache. And a note to anyone who actually takes him seriously as a \"right-winger\".... it's called satire.

Whatever makes Colbert so hilarious and charming on television didn't make it onto the page. The book also felt cobbled together by different writers. Sometimes jokes felt heavy-handed; other times the sarcasm was so subtle that it made Colbert's faux uber-conservatism kind of uncomfortable."}], "description": "Congratulations--just by opening the cover of this book you became 25% more patriotic.From Stephen Colbert, the host of television's highest-rated punditry show The Colbert Report, comes the book to fill the other 23\u00bd hours of your day. I Am America (And So Can You!) contains all of the opinions that Stephen doesn't have time to shoehorn into his nightly broadcast.Dictated directly into a microcassette recorder over a three-day weekend, this book contains Stephen's most deeply held knee-jerk beliefs on The American Family, Race, Religion, Sex, Sports, and many more topics, conveniently arranged in chapter form.Always controversial and outspoken, Stephen addresses why Hollywood is destroying America by inches, why evolution is a fraud, and why the elderly should be harnessed to millstones.You may not agree with everything Stephen says, but at the very least, you'll understand that your differing opinion is wrong.I Am America (And So Can You!) showcases Stephen Colbert at his most eloquent and impassioned. He is an unrelenting fighter for the soul of America, and in this book he fights the good fight for the traditional values that have served this country so well for so long.Please buy this book before you leave the store.About the AuthorStephen Colbert is America.Description from book jacket", "title": "I Am America (And So Can You!)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/611298.I_Am_America", "average": 3.91, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435873807l/611298.jpg", "reviews": 3425, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6649.Stephen_Colbert", "name": "Stephen Colbert"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3117431.Richard_Dahm", "name": "Richard Dahm"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6648.Paul_Dinello", "name": "Paul Dinello"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3117430.Allison_Silverman", "name": "Allison Silverman"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3605493.Michael_Brumm", "name": "Michael Brumm"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7074503.Eric_Drydale", "name": "Eric Drydale"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7074504.Rob_Dubbin", "name": "Rob Dubbin"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1979088.Glenn_Eichler", "name": "Glenn Eichler"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/704090.Peter_Grosz", "name": "Peter Grosz"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/206247.Peter_Gwinn", "name": "Peter Gwinn"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7074501.Jay_Katsir", "name": "Jay Katsir"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7074502.Laura_Krafft", "name": "Laura Krafft"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4770274.Frank_Lesser", "name": "Frank Lesser"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6558048.Tom_Purcell", "name": "Tom Purcell"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Humor", "Humor", "Humor"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/611298.I_Am_America", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8115966-i-am-america", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2020768.I_Am_America", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2858125-i-am-america", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13528506-america-again", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13529139-i-am-a-pole", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34853119-stephen-colbert-s-midnight-confessions", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7514708-stephen-colbert-s-tek-jansen-2", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19823871-totally-mad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
