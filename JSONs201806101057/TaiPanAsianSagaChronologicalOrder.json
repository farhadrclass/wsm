The port quickly proved a safe haven to ships even impervious to Typhoons.Dirk Lochlin Struan is a Scotsman who has spent a good part of his adult life in the orient amassing a fleet of clipper ships and a great fortune. He is called the Tai-Pan. He has made his own joss by being smarter, more ruthless, accumulating more wealth, and being stronger than his opponents. He calls his company The Noble House. The company is built along clan lines with loyalty being first among the most weighted characteristics for joining his empire, and by association, those selected, will also benefiting from his protection. Before anyone has a chance to show loyalty they have to prove something more than just competence. They have to be really good at something that is useful, something that will strengthen \u201cthe clan\u201d. Struan is tough on people, but that comes from the struggles he experienced reaching the top of the mountain. He knows how merciless life can be and his primary goal every day is to protect what is his and the people he cares about. He has a nemesis, Tyler Brock, who is as tough and unyielding as Struan. A man who has been equally successful, but always seems to come up second best. He simply isn\u2019t as smart as the Tai-Pan, but he covets the honorary title. They hate and despise each other, but more than once as the plot unfolds they find themselves allied in a common cause. They are certainly nay gentlemen, but they do honor their own version of a gentlemanly code. Dirk\u2019s son Cullum comes out from London and is appalled to discover the man his father has become. He is rather harsh on Struan, long before he understands the circumstances that have shaped his father. Whatever rules Cullum may believe exist in England dinna necessarily translate to the rough and ready wilds of empire building. \u201dYou used to be God to me. But in the thirty days I\u2019ve been here I\u2019ve come to know you for what you are. Killer. Murderer. Pirate. Opium smuggler. Adulterer. You buy and sell people. You\u2019ve sired bastards and you\u2019re proud of them and your name stinks in the nostrils of decent people.\u201dWell, Cullum, *sigh*, you have very set opinions for someone who hasn\u2019t even walked a mile beside him yet, and certainly not a step in the very boots that built this empire . Struam is undeterred by Cullum\u2019s assessment and plans to have him take over as the Tai-Pan when he decides to return to England to run for parliament. He will mold the lad whether the lad knows it or not. Run for parliament you say? With a Chinese mistress and a slew of bastards in tow? There are better options, half a dozen at least of the women/girls he knows who would help to open more doors for him, but there is just one damn problem...HE...LOVES...May-May. He will marry her and let them be damned if they dinna like it. He has never met a problem that a cascade of silver won\u2019t fix, by God!\nJoan Chen plays May-May in the 1986 film version.May-May is breathtakingly lovely, descended from an honorable and rich family who made the decision to sell her to the Tai-Pan to have someone they trust close to the source of English power. This is 1841 and the first Opium War is in full flower. Concessions to the barbarians will have to be made (Hong Kong) and Struan, the devil man, has the ear of the English politician Longstaff or as the Chinese refer to him Odious Penis.There is the rather odd, but refreshing character of Aristotle Quance, a man almost completely depended on the traders, mostly Struan, for his support. He is a painter, preferably of beautiful young women. He is graced with a silver tongue capable of talking them out of more clothes than they are...at first...willing to part with. He has a wife who hounds him from one whorehouse to the next as he tries to stay one step ahead of her iron grip. He might be the happiest person in this new world that is about to be carved out of the coast of China. \u201dAnd he realized he was witnessing the end of an era, he was also part of a new one. Now he had new history to eyewitness and record. New faces to draw. New ships to paint. A new city to perpetuate. And new girls to flirt with and new bottoms to pinch.\u201dWell if he can keep one step ahead of the wife, by God!James Clavell explores the politics of the time. He brings to light the manipulations that occur behind locked doors over a glass or two of good port or brandy with results that benefit the few over the many. Profits are king and certainly the opium and tea trade were important to the British economy. The insistence of the Chinese in receiving only silver bullion for tea actually destabilizes the British economy as silver becomes scarce and afternoon tea became jeopardized. There have been grain riots, tax riots, draft riots, religious riots, but no one wants to see a British TEA riot, by God! We see the rise of the Triads during this time as well, and in this story, Gordon Chen, a bastard of Struan with his head for intrigue, is the head of the movement. He is a man trapped between cultures, not fully accepted or rejected by either one. Chen is torn between his loyalty to his people and his loyalty to Struan. He plans for any contingencies and shows resilience in the face of a series of setbacks beyond his control. This is an epic tale, with Shakespearean romance, typhoons, love and malaria, incest, discord between fathers and sons, the building of a city of trade, lust, complicated characters with tangled relationships, and an exploration of the power of possession. These larger than life figures are battling on a small and large scale for what is theirs, but also for what will be their childrens and their children\u2019s children. I was very impressed with the depth of the plot, the deftness with which Clavell pulled me into the story, and the breadth and scope he was willing to manfully shoulder to bring these characters to life. \nJames Clavell based Dirk Struan on William Jardine who built the \"Princely House\" of Jardine, Matheson & Co of Hong Kong.Dirk Struan peers at the world through jaded eyes, but clearly and astutely. He sometimes knows the intentions of a person before they even know it themselves. He is harsh, but capable of great tenderness. He is unpredictable, but only seemingly so, because he gauges every situation by much more than just what is before him. His projections become truths adding a mystical quality to his persona. He devours information and knows how to use it. While others sleep he studies. He fixes what is broke before it snaps. As unearthly as it seems to those who know him it is no mystery to me why he is:the Tai-Pan. \u201dMan is born to die, Father. I just try to protect mysel\u2019 and mine as best I know how and to choose the time of my dying, that\u2019s all.\u201dA very interesting link that explains the history of this time period. It was so kindly supplied by Margitte. http://www.china-mike.com/china-touri...ADDENDUM: I watched the movie. There is so much missing from the plot of the book that I'm not really sure how anyone can watch the movie and understand what is going on. At different points Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Steve McQueen were attached to the project, but negotiations fell through each time. Bryan Brown was cast to play Dirk Struan and actually plays the part well. Joan Chen is absolutely stunning as May-May, but despite the efforts of the two main actors the movie proves unsatisfactory. This story really should have been a mini-series like Shogun and Noble House. Anybody who may have had thoughts of watching the movie instead of reading the book (unlikely on GR) would be incredibly short changed from the epic experience that only the book can provide.

Shogun was fantastic, mysterious, complex, cruel, violent, erotic, dressed with elaborate manners and rituals, alien thought patterns, ironclad honor, smelly Europeans, the whole works - but it didn't have the Struans versus the Brocks, which crackling, bloody, rollicking, cutthroat competitive maneuverings grabbed me by the collar and yanked me into this Southwest Pacific tale, hanging me on the yardarm so that I could marvel at the entirety of the colorful, frantic pageant unfolding before my young and excited eyes.From the very opening, with a virgin Hong Kong awaiting its annexation by the British, recently victorious in the First Opium War, and the first taste of the rough-and-ready, brutal-on-a-dime sensibilities of the coarse and cunning Brock, the somewhat more subdued and disciplined Yanks of Cooper-Tillman, and then the magnificent entrance of the swashbuckling-but-practical hero himself, Dirk fucking Struan, the Tai-Pan of the commercial empires, and his half-brother Robb - who so dearly wished to be like Dirk, but just wasn't - all of these heads of Western trading houses and the differing-in-details, but similar-in-spirit dreams of the almost endless potential for Hong Kong - serving as a leverage point for the commercial crowbar they wished to wield to crack open the unimaginable riches of the mysterious and vast Orient - everything is laid out to give the reader a taste of the excitement, the possibility that lay heavy in the humid air.And then fate and chance work their inevitable twists and unforeseen disasters into the mix, and we are plunged into a complex, interrelated web of schemes, ploys, conspiracies, violence, lusts, and desperation, as the House of Struan strives to recover from happenstance misfortune without selling the British portion of Hong Kong's soul, whilst the House of Brock, under the glint-eyed, heavy-handed leadership of Brock and the brutal energies of his hulking son, Gorth, do everything in their power to ensure that Struan and Company flounder and sink, thus enabling Brock to assume to title of Tai-Pan that he holds by right should be his. Into this mix the talented Clavell tosses wizened Chinese bigwig merchants and secret societies, four mysterious halved coins, stiff-lipped British naval officers, conniving Russian Grand Dukes, corrupt and incompetent English plenipotentiaries, Aye, matey pirates and lice-infested British rogue mercenaries, typhoons, storms, crazy oceanic currents and, topping it all, the heady and blossoming love between Dirk and his Chinese mistress May-May, an interesting microcosm of the tentative-but-burgeoning relationship between Western and Oriental civilizations, each with their own conceptions of pride, honor, barbarism, and justice; perhaps only in love do they operate on jointly familiar ground.I have since come across plenty of criticisms of Clavell, about how much he got wrong, or mangled irredeemably in the process of crafting his complicated thrillers featuring clashing, pre-modern cultures. Whatever. The man could tell a tale, and one with enough recognizable features enmeshed within the exotic and the historic to propel his literary vessel across roiling, tempestuous seas. It is a magnificent and vastly entertaining book, one I've read several times, never failing to tense up when Struan is ghosting across the water, nursing his fortune-saving forty lacs of silver from a hungry Brock; or dearly wish Gorth would, at any point, receive a desperately deserved thrashing; or marvel at the long-range thinking of the wise Jing-Qua; or cringe when May-May, bedecked in all of the gaudy accoutrements of a European lady, earns an unexpected and humiliating look of horrified shock from her surprised lover; or feel a melancholy heaviness when the typhoon smashes the island towards the end of the book, dealing harshly with Dirk and May-May, but opening up new vistas of opportunity for Culum to emerge from his father's formidable shadow. It's been a long time since I last cracked it open, but do I harbor any doubts that it would still prove to be a first-rate page turner? Ha!"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "I've read this before & really liked it, but it is even better as an audio book. Incredible, really. John Lee has great accents & intonations & really makes the book come alive.Clavell is most famous for Sh\u014dgun, the first of his Asian series, which was made into a mini series starring Richard Chamberlain. It was excellent & takes place about 2.5 centuries earlier in Japan. Tai-Pan is about the founding of Hong Kong about 1840 & takes place over a period of 6 months. It was made into a movie in the mid 80's, but wasn't nearly as good. Too much was left out & a movie just can't capture Dirk Struan.Dirk Struan is quite possibly my favorite heroic figure in fiction. He comes from the early Victorian culture & Clavell does an excellent job contrasting attitudes. Where the rest of the British believe their culture is far superior to the 'heathen Chinese', Struan has adopted many of the Chinese customs that make sense to him. He rejects others to the dismay of his mistress & the resulting dialog is often hilarious, especially with John Lee's fantastic reading. Through it all, Dirk Struan strides like a giant. He's just a man, but he dominates those around him, disparate cultures, cut-throat business, & murky politics through sheer nerve, will & intelligence. He's open handed with those less fortunate & the devil himself to those who wrong him or his.The historical aspect of all Clavell's books is also really interesting. The broad strokes are accurate such as why the opium trade exists, Hong Kong is so important, & more. The people & events are mostly fictional, though. I'm not sure how accurate his portrayal of the culture is, but don't really care. It certainly came alive & immersed me. Best of all was the way he managed to compare & contrast the cultures. For instance, people are basically bought & sold by the Chinese, Americans, & British, yet they each think the others are awful in the way they do it. The differences in medicine, politics, business, religion, sex, & every day life are extraordinary. He does a great job of bringing alive alien concepts such as 'face'(similar to reputation) & 'joss', a sort of luck/karma/fate mix. John Lee narrates Gai-Jin & Noble House, too. I'll be listening to both soon since they're continuations of this story. David Case narrates Sh\u014dgun & King Rat, neither of which is tied closely to the Noble House, although all are part of Clavell's Asian Saga. Whirlwind, the last of the series & another of the Noble House novels, isn't owned by my library, unfortunately. I'm going to try to find it else where.Here is the Wikipedia entry for Clavell's Asian Saga (contains spoilers):http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asia...Tai-Pan novel:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai-Pan_...Film:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai-Pan_...I can't recommend this book highly enough, especially read by Lee. I think it's 25 hours long, so would be perfect for a long trip.

I read Shogun when I was 14, and remember liking it enough to read through the 1000+ pages (and that sex scene with the anal beads? Blew my 14 year old mind. And my DAD had read the book. Yikes.) Maybe my taste is different now but Tai Pan is pretty dissapointing. Lots of cool historical details, but they feel a bit shoe-horned in, and the main character is, well, basically perfect. At least in James Clavell's mind. Big lusty Scottish pirate with a crazy dream to unite the traditions of China and Europe. I dunno, still weird to have an unambiguously good character who is basically a wealthy drug dealer that started a war with China to protect his opium trade. I gave up on this 200 pages in."}, {"userName": "Checkman", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5117003-checkman", "userReview": "Big, chewy, lip smacking, gut busting fiction. How appropriate that I should have finished it on Thanksgiving - a day given to gastronomical excess.Whew. This is not a historical tome. It is a fictionalized account of the first year of the British colony of Hong Kong (1841). The characters are all loosely based on actual people - as are their trading companies. That is what Clavell did in his novels and it's important that one understand that.Clavell was also an ardent supporter of Free Trade, an avowed opponent of Communism and Fascism and an admirer of certain aspects of both Asian and Western culture. Much has also been written about Clavell's fondness of blending those aspects that he believed were the best of both worlds to make a new culture. I would have to agree with those folks. All these aspects of Clavell come out strongly in his novels and will either drive you crazy or have you nodding in agreement. Whatever route you take it might be helpful to be prepared. Finally, and this is something that many seem to never take into account, James Clavell made his career for many years as a Hollywood screenwriter and movie director. He wrote popular entertainment (The Great Escape, The Fly and To Sir, with Love) and they were mainstream, big budget (mostly) affairs. Clavell brought this aspect to all of his novels as well. Being aware of the before mentioned details are important. They all play a major part in Clavell's writing. When you get right down to it Tai-Pan is a historical romance in the older sense (a literary genre of high culture, romance or chivalric romance is a style of heroic prose and verse narrative that was popular in the aristocratic circles of High Medieval and Early Modern Europe. They were fantastic stories about marvel-filled adventures, often of a knight errant portrayed as having heroic qualities, who goes on a quest) only in this case Dirk Straun's quest is the never ending struggle to ensure that his company continue to thrive. As has been pointed out by others there is no grand battle to fight in this story, no Uber Villain to be brought down, no single event at all. The journey is the story. As a result there is a never ending series of \"mini-adventures\" within the story. Schemes are enacted, others are discovered, moves and counter-moves, friends are enemies and enemies are friends, and sailing ships race across the South China Sea. Grand adventure - not academia. It's entertaining. It's not historical scholarship. Are there problems? Of course there are. At times Dirk Straun does become tiresome. He's too perfect - a paragon of male virtue. Or at least what James Clavell considered to be male virtue. He's lucky (too lucky at times), smarter than most, better looking, wiser, etc. etc. I would be willing to bet that Dirk Straun is probably the idealized version of James Clavell. Not unheard of for authors to do that - especially in this type of fiction. However styles and tastes change over the years and this novel was written in the mid-1960's. For many younger readers Dirk Straun might grow tiresome and that's understandable. The role of women in the story will be jarring to younger readers as well. They are important and capable, but only to a point. Then the men have to take over. There are things that are just best when handled by the men. Ultimately women are about bearing children and taking care of the home. Their occasional forays into intrigue are ultimately motivated by their desire to protect their families and help their men. To a 1960's reader this wouldn't have been unacceptable, but in 2012 I have to agree that it might be difficult to swallow. Just keep reminding yourself when the book was written and that it was written by an adult male who had made his living writing for Hollywood. But despite these aspects (and a few others that I just don't want to get into right now - such as the pidgeon English conversations - ugh) Tai-Pan is entertaining. It grabs you and keeps you interested. Though it took me a month to get through it (it was a very busy month and novel reading had to take a back seat) when I did sit down with it I would often go through fifty and sixty pages with no effort. In other words it's a \"page turner\" and that's okay as well. As I noted at the beginning this isn't a work of historical research. It's a big thick piece of popular entertainment. So dig in and enjoy.......or not depending on your tastes.Ironically enough this is one book that I classify as a Beach Read that I actually finished at the beach (Lincoln City, Oregon).

Is it really a Historical novel? Is it a Alternative History? These are the two questions I keep asking myself while working my way through the late James Clavell\u2019s Asian saga, which for your consideration are the following:\u2018Shogun\u2019 (1600)\u2018Tai-Pan\u2019 (1841)\u2018Gai-Jin\u2019 (1862)\u2018King Rat\u2019(1945)\u2018Noble House\u2019(1963)\u2018Whirlwind\u2019(1979) Before joining Goodreads, I had already read \u2018Shogun\u2019, so you, my friendly reader, do not have the luxury of a review of that as comparison, but I believe that what I say about \u2018Tai-Pan\u2019, set in Hong Kong, can easily be said of it\u2019s predecessor.  First off, let\u2019s talk about historical content. Clavell has said himself in interviews that the reason his characters are based on historical figures, the changes of names from historical to fictional ones are due to the fact that he wanted them to do something and say something outside their historical content (an interesting text \u2018What we can learn from \u2018Shogun: Japanese History and Western Fantasy\u2019 :Editor Henry Smith/The Program for Asian Studies, University of California, Santa Barbra), is available online as a searchable text: (http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/learning/) is an interesting group of essays both praising and criticizing certain aspects of Clavell\u2019s novel, but he makes clear that as a novelist, he was not so interested in historical accuracy as he was in storytelling. This puts him somewhat apart from the likes of John Jakes, who attempts to portray the American epochs in his long Kent family chronicles and shorter Civil War epic as true as can possibly be. But Clavell goes farther, for while there is a George Washington and an Abraham Lincoln who resemble who they generally were in history in Jakes\u2018 series, Clavell actually invents names to stand in to the company of historical figures. So, with \u2018Shogun\u2018, instead of William Adams, we have John Blackthorne and in place of Tokugawa we have Toranaga. In the case of \u2019Tai-Pan\u2019 and the case of William Jardine, we have the Scotsman, Dirk Struan.  Why am I making such a big deal with names? Nothing, except that what Clavell is doing rather than telling a historical story, is to make commentary on the times, not by addressing what a given period does that can be seen and addressed like many pieces of literature can and does do (note that I\u2019m not criticizing Clavell\u2019s desire to make commentary here), but by allowing the historical characters to think and do things which may not be historically accurate, yet can ultimately serve Clavell\u2019s point on the subject, especially of East/West cultural and political issues, and one with an Anglo-centric slant.  I have read many commentaries about Clavell being balanced in his view of the far East and the West, for example, unlike Blackthorne, who by the end of the novel practically swallows Japanese culture whole, Dirk Struan\u2019s character in \u2018Tai-Pan\u2019 wants to strike a balance between Eastern and Western sensibilities. But while trying to see their point on two novels so far, I find something rather interesting. It seems that there is a circular argument, at least in \u2018Tai-Pan\u2019 that while Struan appreciates Chinese/Cantonese culture, it is because he is not only a merchant, and one waging a personal vendetta/war against the other merchant rival, Tyler Brock, former, somewhat sadistic shipmaster, but because he\u2019s from Great Britain proper, that his perspective carries more weight, and not necessarily that China has truly (e.g. \u201cspiritually\u201c), opened his eyes, and certainly not to the degree of Blackthorne\u2019s love affair with Japan. So, in the end, rather than being a balance between Eastern and Western cultures, as an Asian saga might imply, it is more Asia as seen through Anglo-Saxon eyes.  Another point in the novel that brings this home and actually puts \u2018Shogun\u2019 ahead of \u2019Tai-Pan\u2019 is the fact that scenes in \u2019Tai-Pan\u2019 are almost entirely set up in the British settlements around Hong Kong. We don\u2019t see an equal representation with the Asian side of things as we do with \u2018Shogun\u2019 and the interplay with Toranaga (Historical name: Tokugawa) and other Japanese in dealing with the \u201cforeign issue\u201d What we get are snippets, then brought back to the British side of things, for example, we get Struan\u2019s mistress, May-May and himself in conversations, or there are dealings with her bastard son through Struan, the secret Triad member, Gordon Chen, the only two \u201cmajor\u201d Chinese/Cantonese characters in the book. There are other more minor scenes and references, but the story is always planted more firmly in British soil. Around this time, there was an ever growing xenophobia in China that could have been more fully examined, but never reaches that point, only touched upon. This could have allowed more characters from the Asian side to participate in the drama. As it is, the main center of the story revolves around the one-upmanship between Struan and his company, Noble House which is based on the real Jardine Mattheson Holdings Limited company, and Tyler Brock, with British politics, both domestically and abroad, occurring intermittently.  Once again my question. Just what type of novel is this? Is it historical fiction, or historical commentary wrapped around an Anglo-centric bias? Why, if this is an Historical fiction, are there not major, or even minor fictional characters finding themselves in the time period, experiencing things for themselves, and addressing what they see are the main issues? Even the word \u201cTai-Pan\u201d is used somewhat incorrectly, as it implies in the novel that the Tai-Pans (Definition: The head or owner of a business establishment), have great political power, maybe even more impressive power than the British Government itself, certainly something that Struan leaves an impression on from time to time, but not an emphasis which the word lends itself to.  The most irritating thing about the book is Clavell\u2019s Chinese character\u2019s sense of diction, accent, and manner of speech. Most of the Chinese dialog in this novel is dominated by May-May, semi-main characters, like her and Gordon Chen. In any given pages she comes out sounding cartoonish. Dialect, accent, and diction are very hard things to do. In fact, to take Clavell off the hook , there are only a few great authors who can pull these things off without a hitch, so I sympathize. But reading May-May\u2019s lines I grimace, as they sound so clunky. For a few lines, May-May sounds proficient, adding to her vocabulary Struan\u2019s Scottish nuances, like \u201cYou dina\u2026\u201d (\u2018Tai-Pan\u2019 194), or \u201cNa so loud! The sea god may hear you.\u201d, as she attempts to appease the Chinese god\u2019s to help their listing boat to safety, by pretending to offer the god gold, but \u201ccheating\u201d in the end, and promising Struan that the god would never know that she tricked the god out of her end of the bargain by not dropping some gold into the sea (195). As she is Struan\u2019s mistress, picking up on Struan\u2019s Scottish dialectical and phonetic nuances are understandable. We are never really given an approximation as to how long she had been with Struan, but it seems to be a significant time. Long enough to pick up the habits of the user of the second language she is learning from. But like many other Chinese characters in the book, she reverts at times from perfect sounding English to becoming the stereotypical Asian woman, speaking cute, quaint, but gibbering English (and I won\u2019t repeat the sexual innuendo associated with Asian women trying to speak English, but I assume you get the idea!). What gives this book a plus, aside from the historical problems is that it is a decent drama and adventure. It has all the passion of ambition, love, and danger one can expect from a story with an \u201cexotic\u201c setting and an adventure behind it. For this, I gave it three stars. But it doesn\u2019t get more, because it doesn\u2019t significantly deliver on its promise on the cover to be part of an ASIAN SAGA; one in which two cultures encounter one another, and the political and cultural consequences that follow. There is a Hong Kong hidden somewhere between two formable and foreign entities rivaling each other. But it is mostly a shadowed figure sandwiched between an Anglo-centric storyline, no matter how much Dirk Struan asserts his admiration and assimilation to some, and in the pages of the book, very little, Chinese culture. I still have four more novels in this series to go. I wonder how much further along Clavell will get in addressing things from both sides of the world?"}, {"userName": "Nate", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6803829-nate", "userReview": "You know that feeling where you just wanna dedicate a slow jam to a book?

If I ever had to have something playing while I clutched a totally fucked up and battered paperback to my chest, I would want this to be that song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR8D2...This shit is that good. It covers a very tempestuous 1841 as lived by a host of characters ranging from traders to pirates to admirals to slaves. We concern ourselves most primarily with Dirk Struan, Tai-Pan (Supreme Leader or Big Shot) of Struan and Company. Dirk has been involved in the complicated and profitable world of opium trading for several years and, as the book starts, sees his plan to win the first opium war with China succeed. As a result of this victory, the British take Hong Kong for themselves and Dirk seems poised to rise to even further heights of success. Unfortunately, not everyone is cool with this whole thing, chiefly his rival of decades Tyler Brock of Brock and Sons.The first thing to know about this book is that it\u2019s not an immersive look into 19th century China in the manner of something like Shogun. This story is primarily about the foreigners living and scheming in Canton and Hong Kong. This works for the most part because, according to Clavell, foreigners were pretty much strictly forbidden from going anywhere other than those two places. We get a little bit of history about the Manchu invasion and the Qing dynasty but other than it\u2019s pretty much epic (melo)drama about the British, Scots, Welsh, Americans etc. trying to get what they want out of China (this is usually purely financial gain but, as we come to discover, not always.) Of course Clavell doesn\u2019t hesitate to push the idea that Europeans of this time were fucking disgusting hygiene-wise compared to most Asian cultures, so you get to learn that for like the 200th time with him.So while there is obviously massive historical context here, Clavell relies on his huge cast of fictional characters to churn up the plot and propel the story for themselves. Thankfully for the most part they\u2019re at least interesting, if not captivating. Strain is the manly adventurer-businessman supreme, obviously. He\u2019s tall, good-looking, brilliant, loyal to his woman, a master of grand strategy and manipulation, generous to his friends and ruthless to his enemies and all that good stuff. You really could write an essay about what an awesome character he is for this type of book but I\u2019ll avoid doing that here. I also loved his clever, funny, ultra-sweetheart mistress May-May and loved hating cruelly violent psycho nemesis Brock. There were a ton of others worth mentioning but I also enjoyed Culum, Quance, Mary, Gordon and their stories.This makes Clavell two for two with me for megabooks. I mean megabooks in the sense that this is a pretty long one at around 7-800 pages but it\u2019s also unashamedly full of pure entertainment. Clavell obviously enjoyed writing these and wanted people to have fun reading them, so he takes the time to fill the book with The Good Shit; sex, violence, piracy, ruthless capitalism, war, constant intrigue and plotting, forbidden love, and cool 19th-century fashion like frock coats, cravats, and top hats. I usually will get kinda bored with most romances but there was a lot of that stuff in this one and I somehow got into it, which was surprising. Struan and May-may\u2019s relationship was certainly full of shit that made me a little uncomfortable as a 21st-century dude (which is really probably a good thing with historical fiction) but there was also a warmth and sweetness to it that was nice.So I guess I\u2019m reading these in chronological order instead of publication date. Next up is Gai-Jin, kind of oddly his last book and one that a lot of people seem to think was kinda boring. I did already kinda peek at the beginning and was certainly not bored with his version of the Namamugi attack. I was gonna go with Noble House but that one seems like it has a lot of shit having to do with finance, which I pretty much don\u2019t understand a lot about. There was finance stuff in this one but it was pretty much limited to Struan and others going back and forth between financial ruin and stunning wealth, with like, bullion and actual gold and stuff. I basically can understand finance when it\u2019s in the form of a giant fucking pile of gold."}, {"userName": "Cassi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666551-cassi", "userReview": "Oh yes, this is the Clavell I remember from Shogun. Even though it has been years, I remember that book vividly. Tai-Pan, although not a continuation of Shogun, is similar in style and character. There are some major storyline differences, but the extremely lucky, strategic and forward thinking main male character, and the bad-but not so bad antagonist. Then, a slew of wonderful side characters, the women being beautiful in different ways, but sly, clever and endearing, and the men, varying dramatically from evil to simple, kind to brutal.If you want the general storyline, read the summary. The book has a story, but you read it for the characters, the double-crossing, the details. Dont expect one big war, or a big climatic event. Its about the journey.As any 700+ page book goes, the first 100 pages are a mess of trying to understand the story setup, and the various backgrounds of the characters.

He has a wonderful enemy in Brock & intelligently fights his way through the convoluted founding of Taiwan as one of the preeminent heads of a trading house.

Not great, but good - I remember being engaged, interested enough in the subject matter, the way the plot developed. Years passed and I tried Gai-jin - I only finished that because I constantly hoped that even turn of the page would somehow bring about the book's miraculous redemption. Far from redeeming itself, that book actually got worse as it progressed. Because I had heard that Tai-pan was better than Gai-jin, I gave it a try this week. Not the best idea I've ever had.Especially for one who has read Gai-jin (and probably for anyone who hasn't), Tai-pan is a terrible disappointment.First of all, there is the problem with the actual quality of the writing. It's crap. Not the crappiest crap I've ever seen, but really - if an author has to repeat the same \"foreign-flavor\" word 4 times on one page, he clearly doesn't have the most innovative of spirits.Throughout Tai-pan dialogue drones, characters overlap each other in their thoughts, choice of words, and actions - and nothing all that exciting really happens in the overarching plot. Even the sex is dull, despite it being set out to somehow shock \"Western\" minds. As at least one reviewer has already noted, the main character is indeed the paragon of male perfection - it's just dull to read about him, and that's terribly unfortunate, considering nearly all of the characters seem to be obsessed with him. They spend a good portion of their time thinking to themselves how annoying it is that he is perfect and that they are weak. Who's the Tai-pan? Oh, Dirk Struan is the Tai-pain. The Tai-pan as the reader is reminded seeming every two pages. Gagfest.I hate it when women are characterized as high-strung purebred horses - Clavell does this explicitly in this book in at least one scene, and implies it in others. Hasn't the \"hot tempered but sexy\" lover motif been worn out by now? I think that's partially why Shogun succeeded in its characterization where Gai-jin and Tai-pan failed - the main female of Shogun was more of a human than an animal and behaved accordingly, even if she was a bit idealized."}, {"userName": "Hasham Rasool", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43718887-hasham-rasool", "userReview": "The Asian Saga: the story of Hong Kong's founding."}, {"userName": "Sean", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3338130-sean", "userReview": "This book is phenomenal.

The weapons and drinks are constantly within reach as these two duel each other and the Chinese.The seemingly dozens of characters are well developed and fit together perfectly into an epic tale about one man\u2019s indomitable positive attitude, even in the face of impossibly long odds.The descriptions of China, the Chinese people and their interactions with the invading westerners (English and Portuguese both) are very intriguing for those that are interested in learning about everything Chinese. The ultra-realist personality of the Chinese is quiet opposite of modern western PC thinking - the Chinese are portrayed as being totally unafraid to openly curse the English and each other while trying to get any possible advantage in every situation (fair or not, because everything is fair!).A very fun read, highly recommended for Sino-philes."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18810398-andy", "userReview": "Currently watching a re-run of Shogun which has spurred me to finally pick up this novel which has been on my list for sometime now.Oh Dear!

On the strength of this, I'll be sure to read the rest of his work.TAI-PAN is epic in scope, a novel whose background is the inception of Hong Kong by the British, circa 1841. Into these turbulent times comes a tail of rival opium smugglers, piracy, betrayal, love, hatred, incest, murder, friendship and natural disasters. Pretty much everything is here, giving this the flavour of a historical saga of old with a distinctly masculine edge (Clavell doesn't shy away from depicting violence or perversity).I'll admit that the first 100 pages or so are difficult to get into, as the author flits from one new character to the next, explaining their backgrounds before getting on with the storytelling. But he does tell a tale very well, hooking you so much that this becomes unputdownable. You just HAVE to find out what's going to happen to Struan, Mai-Mai, Brock etc. next.

And one such series of books that I am slowly working my way into is James Clavell's Asian Saga. Last year, I read Shogun. This time, I finished the second book, which was set more than 200 years after the first one, Tai-Pan.The current book is about the founding of Hong Kong, after the Opium Wars. It centers on the main character Dirk Struan and his family and company, The Noble House. He is a merchant who owns an armada of trading ships, plying the route from Hong Kong to London. His biggest rival is Tyler Brock and his company. There are several back stories involving their respective families, their love affairs, their sexual relationships with European and Asian prostitutes and concubines, and so on. Several other plotlines emerge, including European diplomacy with America and Russia, Chinese gangs, and so forth.Perhaps one weakness of my review here is that I cannot help but make a comparison to Shogun, since after all, it is part of the same series. Every detail I notice here brings back similar aspects in the previous novel. With that disclaimer, I still think that this is a marvelously written book and worth recommending.Instead of describing the plot (which, if I did, would take immense space here as the plot is enormous), I would rather focus on the good (and bad) points of the novel. I suppose the main theme of the novel (and perhaps of the whole series) is the culture clash between the East and the West. Several instances of this appears in the novel. The European general dislike for bathing is described, together with the superstition that bathing actually causes diseases and death. The Eastern tradition of concubinage is tackled, and also how this was viewed by the Europeans. It is actually amusing and ironic to contemplate the fact that the Europeans are offended when the Chinese call them barbarians, and yet they also call the Chinese heathens.I am not a history buff, so I do not know whether the actual events are indeed true, chronologically. However, a quick glance in an online encyclopedia says that there are real-life characters that served as inspirations for several of the characters in the book.As with Shogun, the ending was rather surprising. In the previous book, I wrote last year that the ending was inconclusive. Here, it was rather abrupt. Several story lines were terminated with the passing of a strong typhoon, and power changed hands. As always, the ending provided for a segue so that the generation of the characters can have another story to follow them. I won't give any details as to how Dirk Struan fared in the end, but I should say that for a book that belongs to a series, it holds its end of the bargain very well.Compared to Shogun, there's less sex in this book. The only mention of sex here in Tai-Pan has something to do with whorehouses and sexually transmitted diseases. Also, there is one snippet about perhaps the never-ending theme of Asians being so fascinated with respect to the size of the European main character's manhood: the Japanese geisha were gawking at Blackthorne's penis size in Shogun, and the Chinese servants were gawking at Struan's penis size in Tai-Pan. Depending on one's taste, that may be a good or bad thing. At least, Clavell is consistent in this respect.Overall, as with Shogun, I recommend this book for those people who are big fans of historical fiction. It is a page turner, but it isn't an airport novel. It brings life to boring historical events, at least for some. I give this one 4 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Tim Mode", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23589027-tim-mode", "userReview": "3.7 Stars: Historic, action-packed, strategic, and cross-culturally-insightful, Tai Pan is an intriguing, strongly character-driven adventure (escapist) novel depicting an assortment of 'free-trader' opium smugglers their families and fellow-travelers, and their competitive and cross-cultural conflicts as the Tai Pan (the pirate-trader-hegemon...) consciously manipulates a wide variety of well-developed supporting characters in pursuit of his burning-desire: to establish a British-controlled free-port-foot-hold on a small Chinese island just 1000 yards from the mainland: Hong Kong. The Tai Pan wants to gain trader-access to the vast, rich, inscrutable, but still isolated empire by establishing a British colony on this small, uninhabited, desolate and unwanted rock. In his effort, he's at odds with the isolationist Chinese emperor, small-minded-self-interested British bureaucrats and militarists, and predatory brutes among his fellow pirate-opium-traders: the stuff of swash-buckling excitement, infuriating frustration and well-developed interpersonal drama. In the novel (without spoiling...), \"Green Eyes\" a Scottish pirate, with golden-red hair and electric-green eyes, uniquely sees that Hong Kong offers an ideal, secure, and safe harbor for the traders, who're banned from setting foot in China except for a few months a year during trading-season. I enjoyed reading this book: Clavel offers many compelling and highly entertaining scenes that reveal incisive cross-cultural savvy in Tai Pan. As a recovering catholic, I thoroughly enjoyed one hilarious conversation between the Tai Pan and his Chinese mistress as he attempts to convert her to christianity: her POV on the subject is priceless! So this book is a great read, purely taken as light reading.Unfortunately--as usual--a more-thoughtful reader needs to remain discerning and consciously call out the none-too-subtle cultural mind-warp embedding stereotypical male-Euro-centric attitudes about the Other--particularly alienated (stereotypical-male-gaze) depictions of women (as well as men), as well as Chinese (both men and women), whose cultural difference the Tai Pan adopts in certain respects, bringing Western and Asian difference to the center of conflict in this narrative. I have my doubts (though I really have little factual knowledge) about how historically or culturally accurate Clavel's book is (I'm certainly no expert on Chinese culture much less the history of Hong Kong's early years), but today, Hong Kong IS clearly and unquestionably an important center of world trade between East and West and through Tai Pan, Clavel purports to show us how it all began. Personally, I question the historical validity of this novel.From my POV as an economic historian, the questionable part is that Clavel's Tai Pan (a Chinese term for \"supreme leader) represents as an unbelievably authentic, intelligent, loving, romantic, well-meaning, and even-progressive persona, thought he was once a ruthlessly predatory pirate now cum free-trader-cultural-ambassador who overcomes well-established British cultural and religious taboos to deeply embrace Chinese health-practices, lovers including one who brings him a half-Chinese son, and strong relationships based on trust with many powerful Chinese mandarins. All of this strikes me as, most-likely (if not certainly), a complete romanticization misrepresenting historical reality--potentially fertile terrain for dialectical thinkers interested in the construction / deconstruction of western male \"rugged-individual\" stereotypes, now sadly embedded in the minds of readers of popular media, among others. But what do I know? OK, even as I saw it coming, I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and read on: the saga IS compelling. In particular, I gained what feels like valuable cross-cultural insights into ancient (if not contemporary) Chinese culture particularly the concept of \"face\" as it relates to one's own self-knowledge about how others see one in life as well as in trade. Face turns out to be a day-to-day subtly symbolic interpersonal dance which gains or causes loss of face... likewise \"joss\" essentially your 'luck' in life--are both exceedingly non-western and mysterious to me, until reading Tai Pan. Still, through my admittedly western-radically progressive way of seeing the world, both concepts seem to be self-fulfilling prophesies that justify and juxtapose the status of the wealthy (good face and good joss) with that of the poor (bad face and bad joss): very Buddhist, in it's worst unenlightened cultural-political formulation, yet still a highly relevant formulation that to this day seems to drive the alienated political, social and economic behaviors of so many nation-states in our increasingly sickly insane world, if not masses of people still living on the desperate edge of survival, where \"bad joss\" justifies doing nothing to help one another in the face of disaster, much of which is the direct result of insatiable greed and the degree to which wealth and power have become unbelievably centralized. Bad face indeed!Likewise, Tai Pan serves up a (certainly very-male) point of view on the stark distinctions between British/western in contrast to Chinese women; the treatment of women by men in this historical era--as well as the treatment of women by each other (all from Clavel's male POV...), as well as how women (and men) view their own gender identity, interpersonal power and acceptable behaviors as they struggle--in some cases--to assert control of their own lives, either overtly or covertly--all of which is equally compelling terrain for feminist deconstruction. Nonetheless, Clavel's epic Tai Pan certainly captured my imagination--as I laid awake with it until 3 AM on multiple nights until it was done--it was a compelling page-turner! Yet, the ending was ultimately disappointing: I wanted Clavel to go on a bit longer developing the outcomes of his diverse and well-developed characters: Clavel's ending felt too easy: like a merchant ship fully laden with valuable cargo but jettisoned at sea to be done with her; a way to simply terminate this nearly 800 page epic saga that could well have gone on and on and on.Still, overall, a very fun and somewhat enlightening, worthwhile read... which is why I rounded up to four stars."}, {"userName": "Georgi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2015", "userURL":

At first I wasn't sure I was going to make it through the thirty plus hours of the tale. There was such interesting and educational nuggets that I kept going. May-May became my favorite character and I loved her attitude and the way she straddled her life between the Brits and Chinese. When I got done with the book, I was glad I listened to the end. It was written in 1966 which explains some of the over-all vibe of the book. The one thing I didn't like was the head bobble... there were times I had to back it up and listen again and I'm grateful for Gildart Jackson who did a phenomenal job as the narrator. He had enough accent and cadence for each character to make it a bit easier to follow. If you're into history and the settlement of Hong Kong by the British Navy, then I recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Aparna Dubey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21117691-aparna-dubey", "userReview": "A fictional account of the first British colony set in China - in a decrepit, barren land cursed with treacherous weather with the Scottish, Chinese, Americans, British, Portuguese plotting, fighting, allying with and against each other for control over the trading monopoly in the region.
