He is beyond tried and tested; he is the master of his craft; he is the mighty Uhtred and he is now a war lord to be feared. I pity the man that crosses swords with him.   The shield itself, rimmed with iron, was painted with a wolfs head, my badge, and at my left hung serpents breath and at my right Wasp-sting, and I strode towards the gate with the sun rising behind me to throw my long shadow on the filth-strewn street. I was a warlord in all my glory, I had come to kill, and no one at the gate knew it.\" This book opens with a gory hanging that is just another necessity of war. Uhtred has learnt that a man must be brutal if his enemies are to fear him; he has learnt that in order to maintain his warrior reputation he must be merciless. Men must fear him or his reputation as a dangerous foe wouldn\u2019t exist. The fear is part of his persona; it is part of his character, and a necessary facet of being a successful general. If his enemies can\u2019t predict his actions or understand the way he conducts his business, then half of the job is done before Uhtred has even drawn his sword. He\u2019s already won. It took Uhtred a while to catch on, through serving Alfred he will never receive the deserved glory for the services he has rendered to him. The king is thankless and views Uhtred\u2019s success on the battlefield in a different light. He can never fully trust him or allow him too much power. He fears that his dog may turn round and bite him, which is a shame because for all Uhtred\u2019s savagery he still possesses a degree of honour and loyalty. He quite easily could have been Alfred\u2019s man if he, in turn, treated him with respect. The king has ordered him to be an advisor to his cousin, which means Uhtred will do all the thinking, and all the killing, whilst his weak cousin will get all the rewards. Such is the life of Uhtred. The familiarity of these novels really gives the series a sense of cohesion. When you pick up the next instalment, there is absolutely no doubt as to what you are going to get: more Uhtred. You\u2019re going to get another chapter of his life; you\u2019re going to get the next stage of his development; you\u2019re going to see the narrative change as he comes closer and closer to the retrospective Uhtred that is telling the tale. Uhtred must bide his time in service to Alfred because one day he will be able to reclaim his family home by himself. It\u2019s only a matter of time.  The Saxon Stories 1.

I hate Aethelred, love Aethelflead, Gisela and Alfred is growing on me. I guess I can see reason now with him and all he does.I feel like if I say anymore I will give away more than I want to.

Bernard Cornwell brought 9th century England alive for me.* Unforgettable narrator. Uhtred of Bebbanburg is unapologetic and ruthless yet lovable and admiration worthy character with brilliant military strategic mind. He is a true hero!* Complex and fascinating side characters that you will love to come back to.* Constant philosophical battle between paganism and Christianity that depicts given period precisely.* Well thought-out storyline and twists.* War and fight scenes are chillingly realistic. I really felt like I was there with Uhtred, fighting every new enemy or being part of countless shield wars.All in all, The Warrior Chronicles/Saxon Stories series (all 10 available books) is spectacular story with spectacular writing. It is one of the best historical fiction stories I have ever read and it is the perfect example of how to write engaging historical fiction series that never get boring or predictable!Moreover, I loved author\u2019s note at the end of every book where author explained which parts were based on historical facts and which parts of his novel he made up.

The villains are still easy to hate and there were even characters I wholly liked (Pyrlig is great.) The relative lack of major events in Lords of the North made it a slower read for me than The Pale Horseman, and although this one seemed still primarily focused on the smaller stories of Uhtred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d there was a ton of action and purposeful movement.I have to say that I'm proud of Uhtred. A whole 300+ pages and he didn't commit a single brutal murder of a defenseless person. Either he's getting soft in his old age of twenty-eight or that spark of developing character I saw in the other books is slowly coming to fruition. Either way it definitely makes me like him a lot more and thusly I get a lot more invested in his story and ultimate fate.Cornwell's writing still surprises me with not only its vivid depiction of day-to-day life and war in 10th century Britain but its devotion to describing the beauty and detail of the island. I never thought that I would enjoy in-depth descriptions of estuaries and inlets and that kind of thing but I definitely did while reading this book. He obviously has a strong affection for Britain and it shows with these books.After four books in a row I'm still enjoying them a lot and I'm excited to start the next one but I have to say I'm not sure how Cornwell's going to keep them so entertaining. I enjoy his formula but only because he manages to mix up the situations, characters, areas, etc. within that formula. With each passing book I'm sure this is going to get harder and harder, but he hasn't let me down yet. Onto the next one and I'll see how he pulls it off."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10743961-rob", "userReview": "Executive Summary: Another great entry in this series, that seemed to be over before it started. How can you not like Uhtred of Bebbanburg?\nFull Review\nI've never really been a big historical fiction fan before discovering this series. I'm not enough of a history buff to know what elements are true, and which are fictional. Regardless this series continues to be fascinating and engrossing.Compared to many of the doorstopping fantasy books I tend to read, these feel minuscule by comparison. So much happens in so few pages though. I love to see just what crazy thing Uhtred might do next in his quest for glory.However it's not just Uthred that endears this series to me. He's once again surrounded by a great supporting cast of characters. Some I love, some I hate, and then there is Alfred who I love to hate. I've always disliked Alfred, but after this book he became a total piece of shit. I won't say why, but if you read this book and don't agree with that, I'll be shocked.For a \"brutish\" warrior, Uthred shows a lot more heart and compassion for people in his life than the pious and cunning Alfred, the man who would be king of all England. It makes for a great contrast.I'm already looking forward to the next book in this series. It's going far too quick for my liking though. Before I know it, I'll be out of books to read, and then what will I do? (Well probably read another of the 100 or so unread books I already own, but that's besides the point)."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david", "userReview": "This fourth book in the Saxon Stories by Bernard Cornwell is marvelous! It countinues the same story of Uhtred of Beppenburg, who was born a Saxon in the ninth century. Uhtred has dual loyalties to the Saxons and to the Danes. He is pledged to King Alfred, but he loves the Danes and their warrior attitude toward life. This dual-philosophy gives the stories added drama and interest. I wholeheartedly recommend the series; but I have not been reading the books--I have been listening to them. This book is read by Jonathan Keeble, who does a fantastic narration. He is older than the narrator of the earlier books (Tom Sellwood). This is appropriate, because it becomes clear in this book that the writer (it is all in the first person) is an old man, telling the story of his life. Keeble's reading, coupled with Cornwell's gripping telling of the battle scenes and Uhtred's torn allegiances, make the audiobook a phenomenal experience.I also recently watched \"The Last Kingdom\", which is an excellent TV series that is based on the books. Up until now, the TV series was pretty true to the novels. But the TV series departs significantly from this fourth book in the series; there isn't really a battle for London at all. This was probably a shortcut to get through the story more expeditiously; the TV series is good, but different."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1968826-terri", "userReview": "How frustrating. After all the glowing reviews I have left on goodreads for the other books in this Saxon series (the books that precede Swordsong), I find myself in a painfully awkward situation. I had a genuine love-hate relationship..wait!...love-hate is too strong..let's go with...like-dislike....so, I had a genuine like-dislike relationship with this book. I liked it, yes indeed, but I didn't like all of it and I didn't always like the way it made me feel. I want to try and expound on this, but it is kind of against my grain to say anything negative about the Saxon series, however (yes, there is a however), I have never been scared of going against the grain, so let's rush on.I have read another reviewer of this series on goodreads who mentions the anti-Christian sentiment that Bernard Cornwell imparts upon Uhtred's tale. I didn't really feel it most strongly until this book and it was actually so unpleasant in Swordsong that I found myself loathing characters too much. As a reader, this puts you on dangerous ground...or should I say it puts the writer on 'a slippery slope'? If a writer makes his characters too abhorrent, it is certainly a slippery slope and they will lose favour with his or her readers. In Cornwell's case, he creates a plethora of abhorrent characters and then flogs you over the head with them for page after page. Most of these loathsome characters are religious zealots, monks, priests and overtly religious, annoying, incompetent, asinine nobles and rulers. Alfred is painful to read about, but he always has been. Now you have his new son in law who is ten times more excruciating to read about. Add in every unsavoury, slimy, irritating religious character that has ever appeared individually in the Saxon series to date, and you have yourself a big pot of steaming, religious zealot stew served up over 400 or so pages. Mmmmmmmm......a tempting concoction? No, I don't think so.Usually, these loathsome creatures take a backseat position in the Saxon series and while they do annoy me in all the other books, it is because of that backseat position and a limited presence, that I have been able to tolerate them and still love the books. This time, ah, not so much.But hateful characters were not my only problem with Swordsong (I wish that it were the only one).Uhtred has become a subdued, old married man with kids. I miss the old Uhtred and hope for him to return in The Burning Land. I like the character written in as his wife, but having him find love and marriage and kids has also resulted in Uhtred becoming a respectable, dull husband and father.Now, after reading back through my review here so far, I hear you wondering about what it is I exactly I liked about Swordsong, after all, did I not say I had a 'like' -dislike relationship with it?And I did not lie, I did like half of this book also. The last half. More of the trademark brutality, more of the Danes and Uhtred's interaction with them. And he always interacts well with the Danes.  Uhtred gets out from underneath the skirts of his wife, and the skirts of Alfred's robes, and remembers that he is a warrior capable of great warrior things. That is the Uhtred I love to read about.Still, despite liking the last half of this book, I didn't love it enough to go straight into The Burning Land. I had to have a break from these horrid, hateful characters that make my skin crawl.I decided to read Julian Rathbone's The Last English King instead. Once I have finished this, and distanced myself from the Saxon series for a spell, then I might be better prepared for dealing with Bernard's more repugnant characters."}, {"userName": "Vagner Stefanello", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12348405-vagner-stefanello", "userReview": "Review in Portuguese from Desbravando Livros:Ap\u00f3s ver a sua rixa com Kjartan chegar ao fim, Uhtred acha que poder\u00e1 retomar Bebbanburg do controle de seu tio traidor.

I know I should dislike him, he's vain, sullen, petty, often foolish, mostly brutal, and very occasionally, kind. And yet I am fond of him. I grimace when he falls for stupid tricks & when he is vicious without cause. I shake my head and smile when he tries to hide his real motivations from me with low cunning. Uhtred is a very clever, very flawed and very human creation.So many writers of historical fiction feel the need to modernize their protagonists - all those perky girls who ride astride and hate embroidery, all the bleeding heart liberal heroes who fret over slavery and violence and all the other nasty period habits modern readers find unpalatable. Those sort of books might be populated by nicer folk, but they don't ring true. Uhtred feels like a real Saxon, and though I am fond of him - if I was on fire, he wouldn't piss on me to put it out - He'd probably throw another faggot on and warm his mead.Alfred is probably closest to our modern sensibilities, well maybe a evangelical Christian from the Bible Belt - and seeing him through Uhtred's eyes makes the king much more entertaining as a character. There is a layering & an irony of narrative that makes these books much more complex than they appear.The language is simple, though it does have the rhythm and stress of Anglo Saxon poetry - thankfully without the alliteration, but there are quite complex historical themes at work. Of particular interest in this book is the role of the oath and how Alfred uses this to slowly bind people to him and his notion of an emerging England. The oath of fealty was to become the cornerstone of Feudal control in the Medieval period, and it is fascinating to see the evolution of this type of government through the eyes of a warrior of the old school. You really get a sense of how manipulative Alfred must have been. No matter how hard Uhtred wriggles, he can't escape Alfred's hook - any more than he can escape his Fate."}, {"userName": "Arnis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6257859-arnis", "userReview": "https://poseidons99.wordpress.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "This one gets 4 stars instead of 5 for only one reason: its an 'audiobook thing'.

I love the way the author has developed the characters, and some of them are quite complicated....like Uhtred.

The historical place names and character names are pretty much real and add to the whole feel of the 9th century. Where a sickly, extremely pious, but sharp witted prince becomes not only a king, when he was not directly in line to take the throne. But becomes known as King Alfred The Great, despite his frail body and constant illness, and despite (or maybe, because of) his pious beliefs and surrounding himself with some dubious priests. But, Alfred needs warriors, he needs armies, he needs a Warlord that men will follow because he fights at their side and slaughters his enemies. It turns out that Lord Uhtred, a saxon born Lord, raised by the very pagans that Alfred needs destroyed, is the only man for the task. But, someone who is so renowned as a battle lord who also has a Lord's rights to land in the north of England, needs to be kept on a short leash. And Lord Uhtred, although loyal, is not a man to be tethered or dictated to. Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg is a brilliant character, well written and certainly well thought out. This book, and the Saxon series as a whole, has no shortage of really well written characters. Diversity, amnity, and alliegence are done with skill in the main and supporting characters. The real bonding between Lord Uhtred and Lady AEthelflaed (King Alfred's daughter, married to a cowardly, abusive ass) is just starting to bloom in this book. Uhtred's old adversary Jarl Haesten is a slimey piece of work. And the two brothers Jarl's Sigefrid and Erik couldn't be much more diverse. Jarl Erik actually comes across as a decent man. There is a point, after one of the battles where Erik and his brother are retreating, where Erik asks who leads. One of Uhtred's friends, the warrior priest, Pyrlig, points out that Lord AEthelred (the abusive husband to King Alfred's daughter) commands, and Lord Uhtred disobeys. Lord Uhtred then gives Jarl Erik, and his men, their freedom. There is so much more to this book. And I believe it to be one of the best three in the Saxon series, so far.

It's just plain bad manners! And insulting to God! I'm astonished at you, Uhtred, I really am! I'm astonished and disappointed.\"\"Yes, father,\" I said, smiling....and Uhtred and Pyrlig:\"But I've known Aethelflaed forever!\" I exclaimed.\"He fears you know her only too well,\" Pyrlig said, \"and it drives him to madness.\"\"But that's stupid!\" I spoke angrily.\"It's jealousy,\" Pyrlig said, \"and all jealousy is stupid.\" More favorite passages from the book:\"It is strange what men talk about before battle.

I'm having such a wonderful time with this series, especially getting to read it with my hubby!"}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37399719-tammy", "userReview": "What a book!

In this installment, Uhtred fights to take London back from the invading Northemen, the Vikings. Uhtred, who loves the Vikings far more than he cares for the Christian religion of the king he is continually sworn to serve, now must fight to take back London and to save Alfred, and his family, from defeat at the hands of the Norse invaders.This book, beginning in the year 885, probably doesn't see the end of 886 before the final page is turned. Unlike the first 3 offerings in this series, this book covers a very short period of time, perhaps 6-8 months. It is a fast moving, blood-letting adventure as Uhtred overtakes Danish controlled London whilst his estranged cousin, Aethelred, marries King Alfred's daughter, Aethelflaed, in search of a kingdom of his own. Uhtred is ordered to produce that kingdom as a gift to the newly married couple. Aetheflaed, a young woman whom Uhtred has known and loved as a daughter since she was a child, marries Uhtred's cousin, Aethelred, a man who Uhtred respects little and whom Uhtred, thanks to Alfred's order, owes much; begining with the city of London.As we again hear Uhtred continue the story of his service to Alfred (All of the books in this series are told in first person), we find that a dead Dane skald (poet) is rising from his grave and announcing that Uhtred is to be King of Mercia. Uhtred witnesses this dead rising and follows the corpses instruction to meet with the Danish attackers who want to take the Saxon lands, present day England. Uhtred obeys the skald and travels to the Danish stronghold in London to meet 2 brothers, Erik and Sigefrid Thirgilson, and Haesten, a man who Uhtred once saved and who owed Uhtred an oath, which had been broken. Uhtred, if nothing else, is a man of his word, but he is tempted by the prophecy of the dead skald. He was tempted by the opportunity to fight along side the Northmen that he loved. He was desirous of seeing Alfred dethroned for he hated the pious nature of the king.Thus begins our journey with Uhtred. A journey that will lead to the battle for London, another war with the Danes, and a twist of fate (as Uhtred repeats throughout the book, 'Fate is inexorable') that will test Uhtred's oath like no other test has in his past.Uhtred is one of the greatest characters ever written. He was born a Saxon and rightfully the Lord of Bebbanburg, a county in Northumbria, a part of Saxon England. That birthright was stolen from him by his treacherous uncle earlier in the series. Uhtred longs to regain his birthright but, being a man of his word, he continues to fight for Alfred, and continually waits for his opportunity to return to Bebbanburg and avenge the loss of his birthright.This book, unlike 'Lords of the North', returns to the gory battle and grisly action of the first 2 installments. 'Lords' was as excellent as the other books in this series, but it lacked the battles and the carnage of the first 2 books and this latest installment; 'Lords' was still an excellent book and I recommend that each be read to truly appreciate and understand Uhtred's story.Thankfully, the end of this book is not the end of Uhtred's tale. Cornwell has promised more works about the displaced warrior. With all hope, I can only wait for the Saxon Chronicles to grow to a library the size of which Cornwell has grown his 'Sharpe' series. A continued focus on this man and his adventures in establishing England for Alfred is deserving of at least a large fraction of the number of books produced on Sharpe.If fate is inexorable, I hope against hope that Cornwell will be fated to continue to write Uhtred's tale for many years to come. There is no greater fictional warrior that I can think of that is deserving of a library of books.If you have read the first three books of this series, buy this immediately. If you haven't read the Saxon Chronicles, I strongly recommend that you start from the beginning (The Last Kingdom, The Pale Horseman and Lords of the North) and read all of the books in this series. Cornwell is the master of historical fiction and, with this latest installment, has proven that he continues to excel. But, as great as this book is, don't skip to book 4; read the entire series. I demand that you read the entire series!Highly recommended to anyone that enjoys Viking, Anglo-Saxon, or medieval/dark ages history or historical fiction.THIS ENTIRE SERIES IS PHENOMENAL!!!"}, {"userName": "Alex Telander", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander", "userReview": "SWORD SONG: THE BATTLE FOR LONDON BY BERNARD CORNWELL: We last left Uhtred, in Lords of the North, apparently an ally with King Alfred, while the Vikings were making a very successful takeover of England, making it seem like there was little hope left for Alfred and his Saxon people. But Alfred has God on his side, and feels he will be ultimately victorious; Uhtred on the other hand, a pagan, cares little for this Christian religion, but is still a little unsure of where his allegiances lie. While the first three of the Saxon Chronicles gave little hope and direction for Uhtred, in Sword Song, he has more to fight for with a wife and child, and another baby on the way. The old Roman town of London, an important one with its link to the Thames, has been taken over by the Vikings. If Alfred gives them London, Wessex is next and soon there will be little left to defend and England will be a Viking nation. So Alfred charges Uhtred with this great task to use the Saxon army, as well as his own loyal men, and take back London.At this point Uhtred is an warrior and a great leader in a shield wall. But with the siege of London, he must mount an attack from the Thames, using ships and men. It will involve all his previous experience of battle, as well as appeasing both the Saxon army, and his own Northmen. His plan is to appear as an ally to the Vikings upon reaching London which, with his history, is a possibility, but then to spring the trap and take back the pivotal town. The question is whether Uhtred will live up to his side of the bargain, with his loyalty being challenged. Coupled with this is Aethelfl\u00e6d, Alfred\u2019s daughter, who has been recently kidnapped and is being held somewhere in London by a Viking lord; her life must be protected at all costs.Sword Song jumps the bestselling series one big step forward, with this pivotal battle in the creation of the nation of England and its people. Ending on a cliffhanger, Cornwell skillfully leaves fans having to wait another whole year until they can get the next important chapter in the story of Alfred the Great.

Love, love, love this series!Uhtred is a little less, uh, murderous in this one (which only means he doesn't kill unarmed -priests- in cold blood). It still has the humor brutality of war, vivid descriptions of life, Uhtred's spontaneous actions, and some new wonderful (and easily hated villainous) characters. A solid novel, highly enjoyable, that had me loving every single word.And then *bam*, Cornwell actually managed to surprise me with a plot twist I didn't see coming. I should have seen it, the hints were all there but I was lulled to semi-predictability through the last three novels and then he goes and throws something like that in. I can't not love it! The ending had me in tears while cursing and yelling at the book. Fortunately it didn't respond (I'd be a bit worried at that). I am still baffled that Cornwell had the ability to shock me with a major plot twist despite his mostly formulaic writing. This was also probably my favorite ending to the Saxon Stories novels so far. It was bittersweet, emotional, but not as wrenching and soul crushing like the second one (that killed one of my favorite characters). This is another strong novel is a series definitely worth reading if you like sword battles, storming fortresses/castles/cities, mocking of Christians by a pagan, and general warrior brutality in a humorous package right out of the late 800s."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5880552-samantha", "userReview": "In this fourth installment in the Saxon Warriors series, we find Uhtred continuing to struggle with his loyalties, faith, and destiny. While he feels more of a connection to the Norsemen, he remains paired with Alfred for inexplicable reasons. Uhtred is a mystery wrapped in an enigma, and he is a cruel one. Or, as my husband's short review summed up once I convinced him to read the first few books in the series, \"Uhtred is kind of a jerk.\"I still found myself amused by Uhtred's witty irreverence, and battle scenes were as vivid and gory as ever. However, I found the ongoing fighting seemed pointless and knocks on Christians wore a little on my nerves. I also didn't need to be reminded every time his name was mentioned that Guthred's Christian name was King Aethelstan. I blame David Pilling's Uhtred Shmutred post for taking some of the fun out of Uhtred's alpha male style.Uhtred's adventures were certainly still enjoyable and fast paced, but I found that I began looking for him to form more of an objective than dying with a sword in his hand. Uhtred fights alongside the loyal Finan, who shared Uhtred's time in slavery. They fight anyone Alfred tells them to and a few that he doesn't. Not every battle is met with complete success, so there is still some suspense, and the plot is left ripe for the next episode."}, {"userName": "F\u00e9rial", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10702096-f-rial", "userReview": "4.5 stars.

In the 9th century of what's now England, our rather unloveable, but still somehow endearing, rogue Uhtred of Bebbanburg continues the great conflict of his life. He likes the Danish invaders and yet continues to find himself aligned with the Saxons and King Alfred, with his dream of unifying the land into one greater kingdom, rather than just several disparate realms.While reading this fourth volume it occurred to me that I have read some similar books before, although the setting was much different. I was reminded, rather strangely, of some books my dad was fond of that I remember reading when I was in probably the 12-16 range, which were books written by a former Navy SEAL by the name of Richard Marcinko. He turned his experience into some books in which he and his associates were just the ones who happened to uncover some plot and they had to do something about it. They battle incompetent generals and the CIA as much as any terrorist. One antagonistic general by the name of Pinkney W. Prescott III is brushed with the sobriquet \"Pinky Da Turd\". I was reminded of this, though I surely hadn't thought of those books in more than a decade (so much so that I haven't even shelved them on Goodreads) as Uhtred sparred verbally against a monk he calls Brother Asser, whom he hates. He hates all of the priests, and doesn't much like Alfred either, chafes against their orders and rules and on the whole any successful endeavor he has is one where he just goes and does his own thing and returns successfully. He lives by his own rules, gives deference to those above him only when it suits him, has no patience for those he deems weaklings...You know, back to a time when men were men and whatever. Except in Uhtred's case it's pretty clear this world sucks. Even he knows it as he frequently gets a glimpse of Roman ruins in modern-day London and elsewhere, as he realizes that man just no longer has the knowledge of doing things with stone and marble that it did before. They cannot rebuild what was made before. It was the Dark Ages for this part of the world. It's Alfred who wants to build something, while the Danes mostly want to take things. Not that Alfred is immune from taking in his way, as his pious nature leads him to turn a blind eye to the greed of some churchmen.Looking at the description of this book on Goodreads, the first bit is a quote from a review from USA Today which says \"Bernard Cornwell is the current alpha-male of testosterone-infused historical fiction\" ... which means it's probably stupid and I should feel bad for liking it, because I'm sure there are plenty of dopes out there (like whatever reviewer labeled this as testosterone-infused historical fiction) who are reading these books and thinking to themselves, \"Man, it's too bad there's not more men like Uhtred these days.\" Except that would be a load of shit, because he's an asshole who has no place in civilization. That's the point. There's no civilization here. Does the world still need its Uhtreds? Some probably think so. It brings to mind A Few Good Men: \"You can't handle the truth!\" and \"You need me on that wall!\" Yet I think you can enjoy him in a way that isn't aspirational, in the same way that one can enjoy when there is a silly streaker at a sporting event without having any personal desire to be a streaker. I wouldn't want there to be an Uhtred now, nor would I care to meet him. But his inspired soldiering in 887 in battling the Danes for London, well, that's fun to read."}], "description": "\"Bernard Cornwell ranks as the current alpha male of testoterone-enriched historical fiction....This satisfying tale leaves you hungry for more of Uhtred's adventures.\" -USA TodayThe year is 885, and England is at peace, divided between the Danish Kingdom to the north and the Saxon kingdom of Wessex in the south.
