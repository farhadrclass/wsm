I am very pro-sexual freedom for all so I am in no way a prude. However, poorly and irresponsibly written porn, smut, and sex is where the problem lies. I normally finish books but I already put myself through too much halfway through and received a massive migraine because of the book. This rarely happens and it would have happened with Twilight. At least that book was so bad, it was lulzy. This book was just plain bad. I expected a lot out of it because of all the high ratings it was given. Even so, who wouldn't be interested in a vampire book where the vampire suffers from hemaphobia? I was excited when I started but was disappointed after the thirteenth page when the cousins were introduced. It felt like Sands was trying too hard to give them unique personalities but it didn't take. They all had inauthentic characteristics and, quite frankly, they were a little cheesy.What I meant by \"showing vs telling\" was that I want to be shown what the characters look like versus just telling the audience that they're attractive. I can pull a 1-line description out of my ass and that will show you more of how a character looks than Sands can write in a novel. Observe: \"His auburn hair peeked out from under his cream-colored beanie, perfectly sculpting his sharp cheekbones.\" How's that compared to \"he looked good\"? The only character that was \"shown\" was Lissianna and her mother. The description was very vivid and I could already imagine how they looked throughout the book without having to try (yay eurocentricism because western features are the only features that are beautiful /sarcasm). However, I was told that Greg was attractive but I still couldn't put a face on him. Which is odd because isn't this supposed to appeal to horny, heterosexual women instead of being male gaze-y?\nWhy does Lissianna and her mother get to be fully described as \"beautiful creatures\" and not Greg or anyone else for that matter? The women in the book were described to be \"overdeveloped\" and whatnot but all I got for Thomas was that his eyes were \"just as piercing as Lissianna's.\" There were so many things wrong with this book that played on double standards. For instance, it hinted how women should be dependent on men but not too dependent or else they'll look desperate...?! There was also absolutely no chemistry between Greg and Lissianna after their first meeting and Greg was objectifying her throughout the rest of what I read. He was kidnapped by strangers and, instead of worrying about his life being tied up and all, he'd fantasize about being a sex slave to his offenders.The closest thing to a non-sexual connection they had going on was when he wanted to \"hold her when she was sad\" (the cheesiness in this book has just gone through the roof). BAD WRITING!Another problem: the writing reminded me of an adult Twilight. That's a bad thing. I'm sorry to make the comparison but it couldn't be helped. Twilight had useless minor characters (like Mike, Jessica, etc) as does this book (the cousins). It felt like the cousins were just there to fill in some extra pages; it wasn't even to move the story along. Chapter 5 was especially painful to read. Each of the eight cousins went into Greg's room to ask that he not be mad at Lissianna for keeping him hostage and each begged him to cure her phobia...ONE. BY. ONE.None of them explained what the phobia was until Lissianna went to him last. Even then, after about a hundred pages in, Greg was still unable to guess the glaringly obvious fact that Lissianna and her family were vampires. Even when they spoke about feeding, mind reading, and Greg being dinner \nIN FRONT OF HIM\n. Lissianna even bit him during their encounter prior to the conversation (which was actually very well written so it was a nice break from the shitty prose; but it was also a shitty plot device) and what did he think? He thought it would leave a nice little hickey.He should have at least thought they were cannibals or feared for his life or something. \nTHIS IS NOT GOOD WRITING!\n I was ready to throw the book out the window but I like to give every book a chance (and I wanted to return the book and get my $8 back)...so I kept reading.The book was trying too hard in all areas possible. Tried too hard to make the names aesthetically pleasing, feeble attempts at humorous dialogue (which ended up sounding dull), poor foreshadowing\u2014it just \ntried too hard\n. Period. Never even thought to refine any of it\u2014not even the language. There were errors in every single chapter as well as incomplete sentences and...argh! There were times when she abused the thesaurus and times when her thesaurus collected dust (quit with the \"mental kicks\" and \"grimacing\" and use different words or don't use it at all!). Did I mention I wanted to throw the book out the window?It's also incredibly unrealistic. Yes, vampires = not real maybe. Well, neither is Hogwarts and yet I can still imagine what it would be like to live in the world of magic. I don't have as big of a problem with nanotechnology in Atlantis (look at Disney's Atlantis: The Lost Empire; I think that's pretty advanced) but there were so many other things that drowned out the sci-fi idea. The historical explanations sounded ridiculous and diluted the vampires' personalities even more. I have a huge problem with the language and characteristics. You'd think that after a few hundred years, these people would learn to grow up and mature a little. Thomas was annoying\u2014I felt like Sands was trying to make him out to be some kind of hilarious flirt. If I were sitting in a room with him, I'd think he were a stupid-ass wannabe pimp. He's the kind of person who thinks pickup lines like \"So, you're a girl?\" would work.The other cousins were also annoying because of how bland the dialogue between everyone was and how useless they were. They were just there to meddle. They spoke like they were still in kindergarten. I remember Greg saying that they had accents as well as the mother but their language...if you were that aged, the new culture's language wouldn't take on nearly as quickly. I'd imagine old habits die hard. I just couldn't stand it. Lissianna being over 200 years old and still suffering from hemaphobia because of something that happened when she was 13 and no one ever thought to get a therapist for her...that's unrealistic. I was overwhelmed by how ridiculous the book was getting, I had to stop halfway. I didn't even have to think to know who the villain was. I will withhold this information for anyone who wants to read it buuuut HINT*HINT: Less than halfway through the book, you're told that they have a room full of crosses and that they put garlic in Lissianna's food...all on one page.Great marketing device (cover, synopsis, etc) but the actual product was a huge disappointment. I think Sands was just writing it as she went along and had no idea how the story would end. She slapped together a lackluster book with cliche blond vamps with bodies meant to be on the cover of Maxim and cliche men with six packs and a big dong. It'll teach me not to read through reviews with low ratings as thoroughly as reviews with high ratings. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to return the book for something that's actually entertaining."}, {"userName": "Lynsay Sands", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3807647-lynsay-sands", "userReview": "I think I read this one a looong time ago.

I prefer my PNR books to be on the dark and dangerous side, but I needed to read a \"Q\" book to finish the RRRC's A-Z Book Challenge and A Quick Bite was the only one I had on my TBR - for years, I might add - so I decided to finally give it a chance.Lissianna Argeneau is a 202-year-old vampire who happens to be, gasp!, hemaphobic. That's not a good thing considering what she is. Concerned about her future, her mother Marguerite decides to give Lissi \"the best birthday gift ever\": Dr. Greg Hewitt, a 35-year-old psychologist who specializes in phobias. Marguerite is sure he'll be able to cure Lissi's phobia so she can leave a \"normal\" vampire life.From the awkward moment they meet, Greg and Lissi feel attracted to each other, but nothing good can come out of it because (1) she's a vampire, (2) he's a mere mortal and (3) he'll have his memory erased as soon as he cures her phobia. Naturally, nothing goes according to Marguerite's plan, and Greg and Lissi find themselves running for their lives. But who's after them? Her wacky family? An unsuspected vampire hunter?That wasn't a bad setup, but I'm afraid Ms. Sands didn't make it work for me. I didn't laugh at any of the attempted jokes, I hated Lissi's silly cousins (to the point that I lost track of who was who), I didn't care for the numerous one-dimensional secondary characters and I didn't feel any sexual chemistry between Greg and Lissi. They were both nice enough - well, they weren't annoying - but I didn't feel any love between them. They had a strong connection, I grant you that, but it only veered into the friendship zone - at least, that's how I felt.Simply put, there was no character development in this book. Lissi was unbelievably imature for her age. I don't care if she was considered extremely young in vampire years. Come on, she was 202 years old! She should have been way wiser than she was. I just don't get it. Unless... Do vampire brains develop at a slower rate than mere mortals'? Does vampire blood affect their learning curve so bad that 200-year-old vampires act and talk like teenagers? *groans*Greg was another \"problem\", as I couldn't understand his actions. He was kidnapped, tied up and left without food or water for hours, and took it all in stride. Sure, he had a hissy fit at first, but then calmed down and became the most complacent kidnapped victim of all times. Puh-lease! And when he found out that those deranged people who had kidnapped him were vampires, did he freak out? Of course not! He simply sat down with Lissi - actually, he was tied up to the bed, but at that point, he couldn't care less - and listened attentively while she recited History of the Vampires: Origin & Evolution. Gah!To be fair, I thought the explanation for the origin of the vampires devised by Ms. Sands was unexpected and interesting, but I didn't like the way she explored that concept. When all was said and done, I got the feeling that the Argeneau vampires were just like any regular mortal human with a few enhanced characteristics to make them different. For a PNR, this book was the most un-PNR I've ever read.So, as you might have guessed by now, I didn't like this book. It had some good parts - mainly when Greg and Lissi were on their own and away from her wacky family - but those few and far in between moments weren't enough to make up for everything else. Overall, this was a very disappointing read to me."}, {"userName": "Exina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5309539-exina", "userReview": "Lissianna Argeneau has hemaphobia, she faints at the sight of blood. It\u2019s not the worst of phobias, you\u2019d think, but Lissi is a vampire, so this phobia makes her life extremely difficult. Vampires don\u2019t feed the old-fashioned way anymore, they use bagged blood. But Lissi can\u2019t stand the sight of it, so she has to \u2018feed off the hoof\u2019. She hates the hunt, let alone the dangers of it. It\u2019s not easy to find someone healthy to feed off, someone who is not on drugs or alcohol. So when Lissianna finds a hot man tied to her bed, she thinks he\u2019s her birthday present from her mother. Except, Dr. Gregory Hewitt is here to cure her phobia, not to be a dessert. But when someone is that delicious and tempting like Greg, it is impossible to resist taking a quick bite. I used to read a lot of PNR, and I probably would have liked it more years ago. Though the origin of the vampires is very interesting and unique, I expected more from the story: more humor, more steam, more action, and a much better developed romance: true life mates \u2013 oh, come on\u2026 haven\u2019t we heard this enough? Of course, this book was published more than ten years ago, and by now the destined mate thing has got old.

It's just that I don't think people are taking this whole robots-are-going-to-kill-us-all thing seriously enough. They keep making creepier robots every day. Did anyone see that robot on The Tonight Show? Holy crap. That thing is definitely planning on murdering someone. Probably Jimmy Fallon.By the way, can we talk about the fact that \"Sophia's\" designer must have been male? Is there any other reason that she had to have such large breasts? I'm guessing they aren't extra battery packs, or any other reasonable explanation. Just a robot-designer who had a dream...Why am I on yet another robot rant when I am talking about a vampire book? Because this vampire world has the best explanation for the existence ever - nano robots in their bloodstream. These tiny robots cure disease, make them stronger and faster, stop cell degeneration, but feed off of their blood. So, they need to drink blood to replenish.In other words:The robots have transformed the humans into blood-thirsty killers! See? It's part of the master plan that all robots have!I knew it!!!So, although the romance was okay, but a little bland because the two main characters were about as exciting as milk (NOT chocolate milk). I loved the world where tiny micro-robots were the real killers.I also loved the Argeneau family and their dynamics, so I will continue this series happily. See? The robots have gotten to me.

I have so many new series to read cos of developing a love for yet another romance genre, but I have to say this will be one of my favourite series if they are all the same as this. It was a light refreshing read, with none of the 'usual' formula romance angst etc. Unlike other reviewers, I liked the concept of the vamps coming from Atlantis. I am completely new to this genre and it's all fantasy/paranormal/romance to me anyway, so if the book is entertaining and keeps me reading I'm not too hung up on the details of their 'world' as it's all make-believe anyway. I loved the humour. I am always a sucker(!) for a book which is fun to read and this was. I thought the whole phobia thing was hilarious, but would have liked to have seen it resolved (not sure if it is in upcoming books??). Overall I loved the whole thing. The sex was hot, the romance was yummy and the characters were entertaining. No-one in the book annoyed me (which is great from mpov).

Fun enough, but not exactly \u201cfang-tastic\u201d.I have wanted to take a bite out of this series (wink, wink) for years. I was swept up in the paranormal craze of the late 2000s, from True Blood to the Immortals After Dark, and I heard that Lynsay Sands offered a lighter take on vampires.The book was humorous, both tongue-in-cheek (Lissianna, our heroine, is a vampire afraid of blood) and laugh aloud (when Lissianna and Greg need to make a quick getaway, she says that they will take \u201cthe bike\u201d \u2013 and Greg, expecting to fly away on a motorcycle, is dismayed to instead find an actual bicycle). I didn\u2019t feel that the main characters or their bond were very well-developed, likely due to ample introductions of supporting characters and explanations of the unique vampire mythology. That said, I appreciated that Greg was a different type of hero \u2013 more cerebral, easy-going, a good cook, a Beta male who still took charge in the bedroom. And while I thought that Lissianna\u2019s bulb was sometimes too dim - her attempted murderer was the most obvious suspect in the history of obviousness - I did like how she was alternately shy and protective of Greg.

I had never read anything from this author or this series before and I have to admit the popularity and impressive ratings had me pretty excited. This book ended up just being OK for me. I never really felt engaged in the storyline or connected with any of the characters. It was too easy to put the book down while reading and I kind of had a \"take it or leave it\" outlook. I considered adding it to my DNF shelf, not because it's bad but because there are too many books and too little time to read something that isn't completely capturing you. But I stuck it out...I mean have you seen how many books are in this series????? It's obviously working for plenty of loyal readers. I should note there were things I did like about A Quick Bite: I liked the fact that the female lead is the vampire while the male lead is the mortal. Usually it's always the man who wears the fangs. I also thought the blood phobia was an interesting addition to the vampire world. I mean, who would have thought lol? But like I said, overall it was just OK.

I don't know. I wanted to like this book, I really did. I'd read the descriptions and reviews and it just didn't do it for me.Lissianna Argeneau is a vampire with a serious phobia and at 200+ years old, she needs to get over it. Luckily she comes from a very large and supportive family. Oh and did I mention that they get annoying after a while? There are female cousins and a friend and her one male cousin. Thomas, the sole male was witty enough that they didn't need the scantily clad, over-exuberant cousins. It was kind of funny at first but she went to that well too many times early on and by page 130 I was ready to be done with them.Dr. Greg Hewitt finds himself surrounded by this family and despite the fact that it is a romance you begin to wonder if they will ever be left alone long enough for the romance part of the book. Finally about 175 pages in or so Thomas gives a push and things start rolling. By the end of the happily ever after, there were still 60 pages left and then I remembered the very minor sub plot they'd been building throughout the book that I think was supposed to be funny but fell a little flat. Maybe it was because from the first moment it was introduced it was obvious what it was, maybe it felt a little forced, like it was added in to give the story more conflict or maybe it was because I just didn't think it was funny. Who knows?I think that I would have liked this book with less of her giggling cousins and a more integrated sub plot, I don't know. I know that I'm hoping this series gets better because I've gathered them all from paperback swap and can't see myself sending them back without at least trying 3 or 4 more... and if I still really never get into them, I'll skip to Thomas' book.In her acknowledgments section the author mentioned that the book was written out of order, so maybe that's why it felt off to me.

I know it is hard to introduce your own fantasy world but putting 15 family members in this book was way too much for me, aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings, one big happy vampire family.I was extremely disappointed that the hero/heroine got very few minutes together without the family constantly interfering, I mean they walked in 2ce when Lissi was kissing Greg, when she was feeding of him, when they were having sex, and the person interrupting it is not like \"oops sorry\" and closing the door, no he marches in and starts up conversation. \"yeah I know that you are inside my cousin but I have to tell you that we have to go groceries shopping\" (that's not a quote from the book just making a point) I guess if you have discovery fantasies this book will rock your world, they are constantly getting caught.The other thing that was infuriating is the view of the vampires. They are created from Atlantis nano technology/bio-engineering with the main heroine, who is 200 years old knowing nothing about it, like she is not even interested in explaining anything. The mystery that is so alluring when you read about vampires is totally destroyed.One of the first scenes in the book is Lissi having a birthday party, turning 202. What does she do for her birthday - she stayed home with her siblings/cousins and had a pijama party all dressed up in teddies and their one male cousin, in a child's spiderman pajama. Mind you these are vampires 200-600years old. It was ridiculous that this made the cut for publishing. It didn't make me laugh, it made me sad.

The description of the book describes the main character Lissianna as a vampire with a tendency to faint at the site of blood. Silly, but not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Dr. Gregory Hewitt is a psychiatrist who wakes up in Lissianna's bedroom tied up and she wants a bite. Interesting enough to be put on my to-be-read pile anyways. So I start reading it. Lissianna comes from a family of vampires. Her parents, siblings, and friends are all vampires too. It's also her 202nd birthday. She's had some bad luck finding some good food, and arrives early at her mothers for her birthday party. Vampire birthday party. That was strike number one. So she goes up to her room and finds Dr. Gregory all tied up and sexy and decides to open up her present early. She gets interrupted by her mother explaining that the present wasn't for eating, but for curing her phobia with blood. Lissianna sulks and heads back down to the party like a chastised child. That was strike two. The party winds down later and Lissianna and her friends and family are downstairs. All of the females are described as in pastel colored baby doll outfits. Oooookay. The vampires then all gather around asking what do you do at a pajama party. When someone explains they all try to decide which to do first. Should they tell scary stories? Gossip about boys? Riiiiiight. So that would be strike three. I don't require vampires in stories to be full of angst or anything like that but a vampire pajama party sorta crosses the line for me.

Things start to go wrong when Lissianna wrongly assumes that Greg is her dinner rather than her doctor but surely one quick bite isn't going to do any harm?I've been wanting to try the Argeneau series for such a long time now so when I was offered a review copy of A Quick Bite I was really excited and couldn't wait to get started. I'm a huge paranormal romance fan, it's one of my go to genres and I'll never get tired of reading about vampires and other creatures that go bump in the night. I picked this up expecting a fairly light and funny read along the lines of Katie MacAlister's Dark Ones series and I have to say for the first couple of chapters I thought that was exactly what I had got but unfortunately the humour got old very fast and I ended up hating most of the characters.Lissianna is a 200 year old vampire but along with her cousins (some of whom are even older than she is!) she acts like a 12 year old tween most of the time. They were all just so incredibly childish that it was hard to take any of them seriously and I ended up getting really annoyed with all of them. The way they all kept spying on Lissianna and Greg was just creepy and so was the way everyone could read his mind and know that he was constantly thinking how hot she was. I just got very tired of all the erection jokes! On the subject of Greg I thought is reactions to the situation he found himself in were completely unbelievable. He wakes up in a strange house tied to the bed after arriving in very unusual circumstances yet he's more interested in the thought of being the beautiful stranger's willing sex slave than he is about trying to escape. We get told a lot about how attracted they are to each other but if I'm honest I just didn't feel the chemistry between them, it all felt very clinical and there wasn't enough of a build up for me to feel invested in their relationship.Although this story is mainly focused on the romance there was also a bit of a suspense plot in the background with someone attempting to murder Lissianna. That could have added something to the book and made it much more interesting apart from the fact that a five year old would have been able to tell you who was behind the attempt pretty much the first time we met their character. It was so completely obvious that the perpetrator might as well have been walking around with \"I'm a Vampire Hunter\" tattooed across their forehead yet Lissianna didn't once think to question their weird behaviour. To put it politely Lissianna is an idiot, I think this quote says it all:Lissianna shook her head, thinking it was rather amazing she'd survived to reach two hundred if she'd made many mistakes like that over the years.Honestly I'm not sure how she made it to 200 either, she made so many stupid mistakes when it came to feeding that I stopped counting them but I feel like I spent half the book rolling my eyes at her.I'm just so disappointed that this book didn't work for me because I had such high hopes for it in the beginning. I am kind of tempted to give the next book a try though, first books in a series can always be a bit hit and miss and since this series is still going strong after 24 books have been published there must be something good about it. So I may give it a second chance at some point but unfortunately I don't think I'll be in any rush, not when there are so many other books on my TBR pile that I'm actually excited about reading.Source: Received from Gollancz in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6972914-karen", "userReview": "[ She is hemaphobic (that is, she faints at the site of blood).

I know people will laugh when I say this, but it didn't feel very believable....I know, I know. It's a story about vampires, but they are trying to claim some advanced science from the time of Atlantis made these vampires. Huh? I understand that Atlantis was supposed to be advanced...for their time. To say that they had nanotechnology back in those days? Please! I am fine with vampires being supernatural. They are something you can't explain. When you get into the sci-fi reasoning, I would like it to be plausible. This is not. The other hard to fathom area was the relationship between Greg and Lissi. Huh? He is kidnapped but doesn't mind so much because he thinks Lissi is hot?That Lissi faints at the sight of blood just seemed silly instead of ironic like I think it could have been. I had a lot of other problems with this book, but I don't really want to go into all of them.I am hoping that since this was the first in the series that maybe they get better as you go. I will try another one. If I feel the same, then I will have to stop. Ugh, I really hate starting a series and not finishing it though.

Sands sacrifices character authenticity/plausibility to maintain a frothy, light feeling--Greg is way too mellow about being tied to the bed against his will, over and over again--but I was interested in the story. It all kind of petered out though, and Lissianna is just Too Stupid to Be Undead -- what 202 year old vampire wouldn\u2019t be suspicious of garlic and crosses suddenly showing up where she works, for crying out loud? (Okay, they're not actually dead/undead in Sand's mythology, but I couldn't resist the joke.)

Lissi is a vampire with a strange condition, she faints at the sight of blood.

So, for her birthday, her mom \"kidnaps\" a psychologist to cure her of her condition. When Lissianna sees Greg tied up on her bed, she things he might be a birthday present of the snacking kind and hilarious hijinks ensue.While the \"who done it\" in this book was pretty obvious from the get go, it was still highly entertaining and there were enough twists and turns to keep me wrapped up in it. I also appreciated Sands original twist on the creation of vampires and their lives. It was also pretty funny, too!

Every time she sees blood she faints. She has to feed \"the old ways\" by biting her victim and afterwards make him forget he ever saw her. But vampire council has decided to protect their race from discovery and feeding is only allowed with blood of special blood banks (execpt for emergency situations). Lissi\u00b4s familiy is very concerned about her hemaphobia and wants to help her. On her birthday her mother has the great idea to kidnap Dr. Greg Hewitt a psychologist who just wanted to go on vacation and to \"persuade\" him (tied to Lissi\u00b4s bed by the way) to treat Lissi against her phobia. Although Greg would like to help Lissi and they are instantly attracted to each other he is really pissed off at being kidnapped and wants to leave...I never thought I would enjoy so much reading about this exceptional vampire family. It was fun, really! Just the scene when Lissi and Greg escaped her family and their dog on a pink bicycle was worth the money. Lynsay Sands has also created a very interesting theory about the origin of vampires I may add. Even Lissi acting a bit dense at times and not to be able to put two and two together and figure out who the \"villain\" is \u2013 and no one needs to be a Sherlock Holmes for that it was clear from the beginning \u2013 didn\u00b4t spoil my fun. There\u00b4s not much action and suspense in this book but this is more than compensated by the humor in my opinion and the ridiculour situations Greg finds himself constantly in.

It was smoothly written, with some potentially good ideas that could have made Quick Bite into a pretty decent read. Unfortunately the prospect has not been fully explored. Quick Bite has been, however, very popular among para fans, which, after having read it, leaves me more than puzzled. What I did like about this book was the fact that it was filled with potentially (that word again)hilarious ideas. If you think of a hemaphobic vampire, psychologist strapped to bed hoping to be a sex slave, guy filling his pants with a cucumber or many family invaded scenes (that gave me a feeling of The Adams Family) those are all quite comic.Having read quite a lot of books from this genre, to be satisfied I'm looking for more than a simple plot of a vampire girl meeting and falling in love with her 'true mate', falling into some random trouble that I felt were written only for the sake of creating a bit of a drama to otherwise dull story line, than finally having their cheesy happy ever after, surrounded by foolishly grinning members of an Argeneau clan.

I'd say you should give it a go if you're after something relaxing, but if you want something thrilling, I'd recommend you leave it for another time.There were some great parts - funny, endearing (the romance was pretty good, as were some of the family aspects); but there were also others (like the team \"six & a half\" cousins and what not going all \"I want to... Really? Me too... Me three!...\") which were unrealistic and a bit annoying.I did, however, note the exceptional twist on vampire mythology - it was one I had never seen before, and would have never come up with.So though I'm not jumping onto the next Argeneau story right away, I'm going to have the series in mind for when I'm up for something light in the future."}, {"userName": "Lili", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3105804-lili", "userReview": "I really think this is the worst book I have ever read!Why can't I give it ZERO stars?I had to make myself finish it.The plot was silly, the writing was baaaad (someone get her a thesaurus!), the characters were stupid and the bad guy was...
