I stumbled upon a copy of this book at Salvation Army, and being a fan of the sub-genre that is Southern Chick Lit., I forked over my dollar and brought it home in my stack. So started the beginning of the end.Unfortunately, this book forces me to focus not on the novel, as I would like, but on the author, whose underhanded distaste of the South and its people is apparent. When someone literally knows nothing about the author--not even her name--and, after reading about twenty to sixty pages, can wager a bet, with near 100% certainty, that not only is the author not from the South, but she has barely, if ever, lived there, then something is very, very wrong with the writing and with a publishing world that would allow this to be released. Flashback to me on my daily commute, reading. These are the thoughts that are traipsing through my head: \"Cliche. Handsome Yankee from New York. Cliche. Cliche. Not possible. Where are the accents? Why is there a sense that most of these characters hate the South? Cliche. Cliche. Random character.\" Then I stop reading and to the dismay of my fellow commuters, mumble that I have been duped into buying a fake. I flip to the back of the book, and there is the interloper: the author. Who is from New York. Educated at Yale Drama School. Not from the South. Joke is on me, Ballantine Books. The joke is on me!"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/883585-sara", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book, until, literally, the very last page. I thought the ending was crap, but the rest of it was great and interesting. Basically, and I mean really basically, it's about three old women who had a big scary secret, and also the story of a young woman who had a horrible childhood and acted like it as an adult. The whole story is about the big secret the Three Margaret's know, and the families who had to do with the secret, which also tells the entire life stories of everyone in the book, and how it resulted in the young woman's childhood being horrible. The secret eventually comes out, the entire story is told, everyone becomes aware of all the situations involved, and it was climatic and enjoyable, but the reaction of the secret being outted was less than enjoyable, and should have been more dramatic to counter the drama of the rest of the story. EDIT: It's over a year later. I decided to give it another star because I actually find myself thinking about this book still, all this time later. Not about the drama or the secret, but the story that is in between the lines, the story of solid friendship and companionship, and love. How well you get to know other people in your life and can expect their reactions and emotions to even simple words or stories or people. I think this novel definitely showed human interaction in a way that is very real and honest. For that, over a year later, it gains a star."}, {"userName": "Paromita Nag", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16318579-paromita-nag", "userReview": "Such a great book.

Three charming ladies in a sleepy Southern town bond over decades, taking care of each other, saving themselves from bad memories, emptiness and loneliness. Their tight circle becomes more closed as they share the one horrible secret that cannot be revealed. But then it's time...and in revealing this awful truth, they expand their group to take in another lost young woman.Shaffer's first novel really draws the reader in. She makes this setting, so different from many readers' experience, and its inhabitants, very real. The characters are sympathetic although their respective stories may make them seem, at times, not particularly likable.

I have never read this author before. I had a hard time keeping interested in the book. It was a little confusing going back and forth between present day and the past, and it was hard remembering some of the characters and their history. I\u2019m sorry but I agree with someone else that said the ending was crap. I thought the ending was completely uneventful and confusing and not exciting at all.

Ahhhh....nothing like a decades old secret between three extremely close friends to make you grab a book off the shelf and rush home to start reading. Not only is there this underlying theme that remains unrevealed nearly forever, but there is this awesomely wonderful friendship that links the 'three Miss Margarets' together. Add a newcomer to town digging around for information, and just plain great writing on every level...well, get this book and you'll be hooked.

She was excellent as a reader and I will definitely listen to books read by her again.The book was a study of characters.

I think the story line has potential, but the way it was presented was confusing. The flipping back and forth from past to present was hard for me to understand. It also took me over half the book to keep track of all of the character's stories. I felt depressed reading this story, and maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a story like this. I also hated the ending. I pushed myself through the book just for that kind of ending?!
