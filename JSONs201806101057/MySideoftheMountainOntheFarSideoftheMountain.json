When my students chose it as a book to read in class, I wasn't sure how I would feel about it as an adult. Needless to say, it was barely okay.This story centers around a boy named Sam who decides one day that he no longer wants to live in New York city, so he up and leaves, heading to his family's desolate farm. There, Sam learns to live off the land and makes friends with the resident animals.I began to recognize quickly, that my struggles with this book started due to being a realist. You can't write a realistic fiction book and then fill it with holes that couldn't possibly exist or happen. You also cannot attempt to make readers believe that Sam is in the full-fledged wilderness of the Catskill Mountains but then write in characters who stumble upon him while picking strawberries and hunting for game. Moments such as those, ruined the atmosphere of the text.The above definitely influenced my feeling and rating of this book but it was solidified by the overwhelming amount of nothingness that happened. While I certainly appreciated the quiet moments that the author included about Sam's camp set-up, his hunting, and his ability to get back to the things that mattered most, I also recognized the boredom that set in due to those very same things. It makes me wonder if I felt the same way when I read it in elementary school, or if the story held more wonder for me, then."}, {"userName": "Cody", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59698252-cody", "userReview": "The story line was good, but the end was horrible."}, {"userName": "Michelle Isenhoff", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5319195-michelle-isenhoff", "userReview": "\u201cI left New York in May. I had a penknife, a ball of cord, an ax, and $40, which I had saved from selling magazine subscriptions. I also had some flint and steel which I had bought at a Chinese store in the city.\u201d And with that, Sam Gribley left his city apartment filled with two parents and eight brothers and sisters and hitched a ride to the Catskill Mountains. And he never looked back.My Side of the Mountain was one of my favorite escapes when I was young. It tickled something deep inside me. I mean, what kid doesn\u2019t want to run away and live off the land? But Sam is the only one I knew who DID it. I envied him his burned-out tree home, his storehouse of nature\u2019s bounty, his neighbors the Baron weasel and Jessie Coon James, his falcon, and his wide open backyard. I visited again and again and again. Having just finished this book in my 30\u2019s, I still felt the pull of the Catskills. That hopeful runaway is still there inside me.Published in 1959, My Side of the Mountain claimed Newbery honors the next year, and it\u2019s just as good as it ever was. It isn\u2019t a book of fantasy, magic, action or suspense, which are so popular with kids today. Rather it\u2019s a survival story, but one with a kicked-back pace. I mean, once Sam sets up housekeeping and figures out how to find food, he has all the time in the world. No school, no appointments, no stress, only the problem of avoiding reporters. For once word leaks out that a wild boy is living outside Delhi, the outside world takes an interest. And once Sam makes a friend or two and burns out a guesthouse, it\u2019s the beginning of the end. \u201cI seem to have an address now,\u201d he comments. It\u2019s an end I\u2019ve resisted every time I\u2019ve read it.My only complaint is that the ending still doesn\u2019t settle well with me, even after years and years and a now grown-up perspective. It\u2019s too real-world, too adult, too against my inclinations. Other than that, the book is flawless. I so admire the way Ms. George can make a simple plot so compelling, so broadly appealing. And I love how she gently weaves in truth and discovery. This is children\u2019s literature at it\u2019s very, very best. I highly, highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Avalley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59698253-avalley", "userReview": "It wasn't very good, and it was also pretty boring.

You have a great plot. A boy ran away not because he had differences with his parents but he just wanted to experience life in the woods. He made friends, humans and animals alike. He applied everything he learned from reading books about survival. But, I felt like I was reading a textbook. There were no emotions. I didn't even know which was the high point. I didn't where to find the denouement. It's sad because the narrator is a boy and boys are full of life. When they tell stories, they exaggerate.

I mean, seriously? This is about a boy who runs away from home and decides to live in the woods. Now, I have read (and enjoyed) books about people living in the woods. Hatchet was a book I read in sixth grade, and absolutely loved it. The difference, though, is that the boy in Hatchet was forced to live on his own, due to a plane crash. In this book, however, the boy decides to live in the wilderness. I think that this book would be a lot better if it turned out to be a dream. The thing that bugs me a lot, is that the author makes it seem like nobody cares that a teenager is living in the woods on his own. They never specified this boy's age. He could be 10 years old. Then again, he could be 17. If he was 17, I don't think anybody would care as much, but...Also, one would think that his parents would actually care!"}, {"userName": "Julianna S", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13234243-julianna-s", "userReview": "My mommy suggested that I read this book.

The last time I had the pleasure of reading it was back in 4th grade. This book is ENCHANTING to any youngster (or even adult) who's fascinated by the outdoors and-or itiching for adventure. This book reminds me a lot of 'Brian's Winter' by Gary Paulsen. How many youngsters want to get out in the wilderness for an adventure all their own? LOTS (I was one of them ;) ). One of the best touches is that this wonderful work of literature contains a good dose of reality (perhaps not as much as in 'Brian's Winter', however); by \"reality\", I don't necessarily mean the \"reality\" we live in as \"rationally thinking people\". To a youngster, reality is something that can be created and shaped. There are no limits to a kid's reality. It is sad that kids these days grow up on electronic garbage. Their sense of adventure is being replaced by video games and celebrity crap.Take your children out into the wilderness - take them fishing, hiking, camping, mountain biking, exploring,...you name it. Nature is not something to hide from.This is a MUST READ (or else your kids will probably make you buy the book so they can read it ;) ) for all kids, and even for adults who still embrace their own inner-kid :)."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16602652-jeanette", "userReview": "Just finished reading aloud with my 8 year-old boy. I remember reading it in 5th or 6th grade by myself and loving it. This is a great story about self-reliance, and learning to live off the land. As a child I was fascinated and dreamed of going away to live in my own secret place, eating plants and making my own nature home. I definitely enjoyed reading this book again with my son, and he enjoyed it as well. At one point while reading we were looking on the store shelves for a car-washing chamois (shammy) called for in Owen's Wizard Craft book for making a coin pouch. (He's simultaneously been reading Harry Potter.) The chamois at the store was much larger than we needed and therefore more expensive, and so I went to explain to Owen what we might try instead. I said, \"What the instructions want is some fabric that looks like leather, so do you know what we could do instead?\"\"Kill a deer?!\" He said.So I about died. \"Yes, kill a deer.\" How can I argue with that? If what he learned from this story is that when he needs some leather he can go kill a deer then I am a happy person.

I read it with my boys at the New Jersey Shore this summer. My 9 and 11 year olds liked it more than the 13 year old. I think it was a great story and as my 11 year old said...\"really stays with you longer than a modern book.\" For us, there was too much detail of what the boy ate and how it was prepared, and the older writing style was at times challenging to read. And of course the whole concept of him living in the woods with his parents approval seemed more than a little far-fetched. However, we enjoyed all the parts about the falcon and his other wildlife friends, and we enjoyed reading about his little home inside the tree. We liked it."}, {"userName": "Gurgen", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29521981-gurgen", "userReview": "The reason why I picked this book is because the name of the book seemed weird sort of. The cover, when I looked at it, there was this boy and a bird and trees in the background so I told myself this kid might be a loner living alone on a side of a mountain. I would recommend this book to my friends and other people because it was pretty amusing. A boy that does not like living in a city, but likes living on a mountain in the woods.

Every time my teacher pulled this book out I contemplated the purpose of life and wished that the book would just end already.

I find the book \u201cMy Side of the Mountain\u201d by Jean George to be excellent at keeping the reader\u2019s attention and giving great details about things in the book, while at the same time letting the reader use their imagination fully. There are of course some areas in which the book was not quite as good, such as character development, and in a few spots character and reader connection. \t\u201cI was scared and thought I\u2019d never get out\u2026 Ever since that first blizzard hit\u201d (Page #5). Most books are interesting and exciting, but then they usually die out in the end, but what makes this book so interesting is that the author adds in stories and adventures that are a bit farfetched (such as a giant freak snow storm) but it does to add some excitement and flavor to the story and just when the story needed it too. To make the story more interesting the author does a certain thing I\u2019ve noticed though, he\u2019ll put the main character in danger and play it out for a long time just to build the suspense and make the reader not want to even put the book down.\t\u201cMy bed is on the right made of deer skin... on the left is my small fireplace.\u201d(Page #3) This quote really shows this books greatest strength, it has a perfect combination between showing detail, and letting you imagine what it\u2019s like. In the book there are a few pictures, but they don\u2019t really show much, so aside from what the book tells you, you really get to imagine what it looks like. The quote previously mentioned is one of the best parts of the book, it\u2019s for the first time giving you a tour of his home inside the tree and what he\u2019s made, and it\u2019s truly amazing what the author does, because he gives enough detail for you to get the main idea and then just lets your mind wander imaging how you thinks it looks. This perfect combination between detail and freedom is very delicate and easy to mess up, but Jean George sure does know that sweet spot and that\u2019s what really made the book special.\tThe one real downfall or mistake in this book is character development, when it comes to setting up back stories about a characters past, there just isn\u2019t that much to tell. Sam is the main character in this book for example, but all we really know about him is what he did in the forest while the story was told, it briefly mentions that he used to live in New York with his family, got crowded so he moved to the forest, but that kind of gets summed up in about a page, and then just moves on to the present time. Other characters such as Sam\u2019s Dad, Bando, and matt, we really just meet, learn what they do for a living and keep on moving with the story, which in a way is kind of good, it keeps the story very fast pace and moving so that its always interesting, but it\u2019s still good to know a little bit about the characters. \tThe book \u201cMy Side of the Mountain\u201d is an excellent book over all, it\u2019s great at keeping my attention and giving me the right amount of details and imagination freedom to make the book rock. There was an area however in the book that wasn\u2019t quite as good, and that was the character development. I would recommend this book to everyone, but to those adventurous and outdoorsy kinds of people, I would say that it is an absolute must read especially if you\u2019re thinking about going camping, and taking it to the extreme, but even if you\u2019re not, it\u2019s still defiantly a very interesting book to read."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5856048-megan", "userReview": "A great read for young boys.
