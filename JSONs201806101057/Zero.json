He can take an idea and put a spin on it that makes it unique in every way. With all the horror, techno-thrillers out there, McBride once again breaks the mold and creates a masterful story that will have you pondering the possibilities long after you've finished. I found this one to be a little more \"scientific\" at first, but it quickly morphed into a fast moving, horrific story--taking on a direction that I simply did not expect. McBride is an author I watch out for in anticipation!"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1347210-kelly", "userReview": "Picture it: A baby shower held for my sweet soon-to-be sister in law in the most glorious house ever built. The drinks are never-ending, the house is filled with 50 cheek-pinching, arm-grabbing, baby-gushing women. (Now you get why they serve drinks at those things.) Everyone\u2019s gathered around trying to see what my not-yet-born niece will be getting\u2026 where am I in all of this? I\u2019m in the tub with the door locked, a blanket, a very potent drink, and Michael McBride\u2019s Zero. Now, to the question that I know is on all of your minds \u2013 did she get the wipe warmer and was the book worth it?? For the record that girl got three wipe warmers. Oh, and I loved this novella!!! Grabbing it just to amuse myself on the three hour ride to Texas Chainsaw Massacre country, I only read two pages before my little sister decided now was the time to discuss why the world hates her and my parents just don\u2019t understand. Every time she looked away I snatched that book like it was the last hammer at Thunderdome. All I kept thinking was, \u201cPlease, I love you, but shut it!! This damn story is amazing!! Smell that plot, sis? That\u2019s fresher than a newborn baby swaddled in a just-out-of-the-dryer blanket. Hell, it was more creative and captivating than any crazy survive-this-island show.\u201d Would she listen? Noooo. And the people at said shower\u2026 Ohhh, how boring and ordinary. All I could think was that if I could just peak at that book, Brian, Buck, and Dr. Connell could save my sanity and spare the guests my attitude. In fact, I bet with their down-to-earth actions and reactions, I\u2019d find more honesty and sincerity in seventy-two pages than I could within a five mile radius (excluding the Blockbuster, I love those people.) of my current location. But alas, the cheek pinching and introductions were never ending. Oh, and my brother\u2019s lovely girlfriend, who is so sweet and sentimental, began opening her presents slowly - being very careful not to rip the bows and wrapping- read every card out loud, and thanked each individual personally. Yeah, I could already tell this was going to take awhile. I bet the events at Brian\u2019s house were unfolding quicker than this. In fact, I bet the pace was going faster than a 16 year old with a day-old driver\u2019s license. After a quick peak, I was convinced. Things were moving along nicely. Damn!! After the third time I was told about Aunt Carol\u2019s mole, I ran for the bathroom. No longer could I take the weird, yet horrifying stories about Aunt Lynn\u2019s rash or Aunt Joan\u2019s daughter\u2019s lazy eye. Oh no, no more. So, after gripping up a very delicious drink I made a dash for the blanket and bathroom. Holding close McBride\u2019s technical - but not overly so - tale, I locked the door and then hopped in the tub. Looking back, I wish the tub had been as clean as the novella I held so tightly. My pants\u2026yeah, ruined! Thanks Even-though-they\u2019re-not-married-I-won\u2019t-hold-it-against-the-family mom. Appreciate it. So, there I was, holed up in a small, confined room that held the smell of copper, metal, and fear. Even though the air in the rest of the house smelled of roses and plastic, my own private oasis reeked of corpses. Did I care? Nope, not even a tiny bit. Totally engrossed in McBride\u2019s tight and concise style of writing, I barely even noticed. I\u2019m telling you, judging by that book, that man could tell me about his tax returns and I\u2019d be there, front and center. Okay, I\u2019d stop for popcorn first, but after my purchase I would so be there. -As posted on Horror-Web.com"}, {"userName": "Karl", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1935255-karl", "userReview": "Mr. Mcbride digs into the fertile soil in the area between the ghost story and the horror tale. According to the biography enclosed in this 2005 novella this is Mr. Mcbride's second publication, the first being a novel called \"Species\", which I will be looking for.Necessary Evil Press, the publisher of this production has done an admirable job in the novella's creation. The cover is a painting by the wonderful artist Caniglia. The introduction by Kealan Patrick Burk draws an interesting comparison between this story and the Frankenstein monster's creation.Mr. Mcbride tells a heartfelt compassionate story of a young man, his dog, and a situation he finds himself in. After reading this story you will understand just how cleaver the title of this novella really is.

He keeps it basic enough for Joe Reader to understand and manages to keep it real enough to be believable.Such is the case with Zero. A very good short story from Michael McBride. The story was original and moved quickly. There was also a bonus short (similar in theme to Zero) \u201cThe Hands of God\u201d which was equally as good and a bit more gruesome. The two McBride upcoming previews at the end are almost as long as the initial story itself. Not a big fan of previews but was in the mood for something quick so it didn't bother me as much as it might have, but I did take a pass on reading them. I know enough about Mr. McBride to know that the dude can write and I want to read it all."}, {"userName": "Geoff", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2802754-geoff", "userReview": "Wow.
