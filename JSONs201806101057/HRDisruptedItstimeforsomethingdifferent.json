There's less of a plan, but that's ok because the general theme is treating people as adults, consumers and humans, and so it's best to know what your organisation needs and which of the ideas are most appropriate for you.Highlights for me were:* The parts about recruitment and trying to avoid the pipeline of 'job opening - advertise - interview - filter - hire', and instead building relationships and communities, and already having a group of people in mind when a need arises.* The over-reliance of processes instead of guidelines that match the organisation's values, and allowing the employees to provide decisions and actions that match their local requirements and the main goals. Essentially devolving the command-and-control structure.To get best use of them one needs to follow all the references and dig out the supporting data, as that will help implement some of the ideas. As advised in the book, also talk to your marketing department."}, {"userName": "Eimear Herron", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64004966-eimear-herron", "userReview": "A huge dollop of encouragement for those who want to brings the 'zing' into HR"}], "description": "HR has lost its way and needs to find a new direction. The central question this book sets out to answer is: if we are to survive and thrive in this new, volatile business world, how do we lead, manage, engage and support our employees in a radically different way? HR departments, and companies, need to transform their approach. This entails not simply tinkering with the process or the mechanics, but taking a completely fresh look at the entire scenario. It\u2019s the difference between spending hours deciding how many grades there should be in an employee grading system, and asking if grading people actually increases their ability to perform better in the first place. To achieve this change, Disruptive HR has three pillars: 1. Treating employees as adults not children 2. Treating employees as consumers or customers (not a one-size-fits-all approach) 3. Treating employees as human beings EACH: Employees as Adults, Consumers and Human beings. (Each of us is different, each of us deserves better.) So what happens when you read this book? First, there\u2019s the lightbulb moment: \u2018I do that and I hadn\u2019t even realised it\u2019. Then you\u2019ll see what this means for you and your organisation, with practical tools, ideas and techniques so you can start making changes immediately. And finally, the hard bit: this book will help you introduce this new thinking to others in your business.", "title": "HR Disrupted: It's time for something different", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33839273-hr-disrupted", "average": 4.41, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1484165756l/33839273.jpg", "reviews": 6, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1524168.Lucy_Adams", "name": "Lucy Adams"}], "type": ["Business"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33839273-hr-disrupted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10416437-tuck-your-skirt-in-your-panties-and-run", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3597247-if-mama-don-t-laugh-it-ain-t-funny", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33534628-hr-disrupted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18428999-abc-book-of-literary-devices", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34300782-40-words-for-a-special-mother"]}
