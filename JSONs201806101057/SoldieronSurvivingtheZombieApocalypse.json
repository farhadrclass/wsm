Zombies are everywhere. The \u201cOmega\u201d virus has turned the dead into the living dead. His wife and daughter are out there somewhere, at least he hopes so. Follow Cade and his ragtag group of survivors in the next story in the Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse series.The narration for Soldier on was done by Chris Patton. Patton did the narration for the first book Trudge also, and since I just listened to Trudge not too long ago I\u2019m really glad that I got to continue with the story. To me, Chris Patton IS Cade Grayson. He has the perfect voice to give you a feeling of complete control all while everything is falling apart around himSoldier on picks up directly after Trudge did, literally being the next sentence. I\u2019m really glad that I was given the opportunity to listen to this in quick sucession because the story was fascinating to me. Normally a zombie book is all about either a survivor or the zombies. If it\u2019s about the survivor, there are usually two camps, either they are unlikely survivors or likely. Cade falls into the likely category due to his training, but for some reason this book feels completely different from other books like it. I\u2019m going to chalk it up to the way that Chesser writes the story. Cade\u2019s air of confidence while everything around him goes to crap is really interesting, and even though he\u2019s confident, he\u2019s not cocky.Chesser does a wonderful job painting the scenes without overdoing it. So many times authors will spend page after page describing something that is a passing glimpse. Chesser, thankfully, does not do this. The reader is given just enough information to feel informed, and then he moves on.Many times I found myself on the edge of my seat. I would say that Solider On kept me up late, but I listened to it in two quick successions because I couldn\u2019t get enough of it!Another part that I really enjoyed was the slight nod to a backstory, and the new inclusion of some conspiracy theory in too.Soldier On was better than Trudge, and I loved Trudge. I can\u2019t wait to see where this series is going. Cade, I\u2019m coming with ya!"}, {"userName": "Tai", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14947655-tai", "userReview": "This 2nd book in the series picked up from the first and it basically continues the storyline. The first quarter of the book definitely contained more action than the first book and then the middle part of the book was utterly slow. It introduced a lot of \"side storylines\" some of which just seemed rather pointless like \"Why was this introduced?\" when it didn't lead into anything. It felt like there were a lot of pointless fillers in this book. Much of the dialogue in this book didn't really serve to advance the story line much. Rather it was more like \"idle dialogue\" that was aimed to home in and remind the reader that whatever the protagonist is going through, it is dire and important and \"time is of the essence.\" Despite all these \"side storylines\" it still felt like a sluggish read from the middle half until towards the end of the 3rd quarter of the book wherein the pace quickly sped up. It was still a good read albeit, it did feel like it bounced around a lot."}, {"userName": "Thia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24896927-thia", "userReview": "This is better than the first book. The women are getting some spunk and are much more realistic, and there are many new and interesting characters that are fleshing out well. One big butt - and that is the main character Cade. First, dumb annoying name. Second, he's a jerk. One character in particular seems to bring on his wrath and his crime? Being fat and a civilian. I'm former military and from a military family and I don't know a single soldier that thinks about civilians so negatively. Particularly special forces guys - they die and kill so that civilians can BE civilians. They stand between the worst the world (and undead ;) have to offer and the civilians they protect. I don't know any who would be so resentful and nasty just because a civilian acted like a civilian - scared s***less, confused, and not in top physical shape. Cade is just a mean jerk and not a good soldier. Other than that, good addition to the series."}, {"userName": "Lauren Dowding", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21675820-lauren-dowding", "userReview": "I'm enjoying this book series at the moment while i'm slowly reading them in between other books. Although brilliantly written, I did find this second novel rather dull. I find that it switches to much between the different characters and so it gets confusing at times to what is happening to who. I also find that it goes to much into the military aspects of the whole situation and would like it to focus more on the main characters and the challenges they are facing with the zombies and their new life they have to live. All in all i am looking forward to reading the rest of the books but it shall take some time as i find i can't read one after the other.

I love how the story moves fluidly between books. There is no fear of missing crucial events that would make you scratch your head and ask, \"When did that happen?\" Shawn is a great story teller. I especially love the details he incorporates into his scenes, and yes, even the gory scenes. His characters are so well developed that your heart goes out to even those who make a cameo. Not too many authors can do that. Shawn can, and this is why this series is one to read."}, {"userName": "Lexie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9466507-lexie", "userReview": "I really liked this book.

Soldier On, Book 2 in the Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse series, picks up on Day 4 where \"Trudge: Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse\" left off. For Cade Grayson, father, husband, and former Delta Force operator, life has changed drastically over the course of forty-eight hours. He's watched the dead inexplicably return to life before his very eyes. He's lost many people near and dear to him, most dying unfathomably horrible deaths at the hands of the dead who have seemingly overnight taken over the big metropolis-their numbers and hunger for human flesh growing exponentially with each passing hour. After having been forced to kill his reanimated neighbors in self-defense and then surviving the perilous overland journey from his home in Portland, Oregon, Cade finds temporary refuge inside the wire of a Special Forces garrison on the outskirts of Salt Lake City, Utah. But his stay is short and he decides to strike out alone, resuming the search for his missing wife, Brook, and eleven-year-old daughter, Raven, the only way he knows how-with a laser-like focus and full speed ahead. So in the early morning hours on Day 4 of what might be the United States and perhaps the entire globe's Extinction Level Event, he slips out Camp Williams' back gate riding a specially modified off-road motorcycle. Armed and resupplied and with only a satellite phone connecting him to the crumbling world, Cade soldiers on eastbound-locked and loaded-with Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, his small family's last known whereabouts, dead set in his sights. Meanwhile, four hundred miles away in Colorado Springs, Colorado-the new capital of the United States-President-by-succession Valerie Clay works round the clock with what's left of the military to gather together the resources and scientific know-how necessary to stop the Omega Virus' rapid spread and, starting with Colorado Springs, rid the country of the multitudes of walking dead. Will the nineteen hundred miles and the millions of dead in Cade's path succeed in keeping him separated from his family? Will mankind find a foothold against the dead and turn the tide of war? Cade Grayson, locked and loaded, is determined to find out.", "title": "Soldier on\n      \n          (Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23338452-soldier-on", "average": 4.17, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1474519761l/23338452.jpg", "reviews": 46, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5095036.Shawn_Chesser", "name": "Shawn Chesser"}], "type": ["Horror", "Horror", "Adventure"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23338452-soldier-on", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13494439-soldier-on", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28408079-soldier-on", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13192017-soldier-on", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23338453-trudge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24810926-a-pound-of-flesh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22597115-warpath", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24533815-mortal", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23173847-in-harm-s-way"]}
