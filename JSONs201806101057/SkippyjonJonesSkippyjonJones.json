From the non-sequitur rhymes that mutilate the spanish language, to the Chihuahuas' preoccupation with beans, the boiled-down rendition of Mexican culture is about as \"Mexican\" as cow entrails squeezed through ammonia is \"beef.\" If the entirety of Schachner's creation wasinspired by the Taco Bell dog, I wouldn't be surprised. The only thing that's missing from this book is a reference to Mountain Dew \"Baja Blast.\"We can't hold Skippy completely accountable, however. He's a sheltered young boy who can only rely on the shallow intimations of other species and cultures he finds in popular culture, to escape his dreary existence. The fact that he spends his time with birds reveals to the audience that Skippy's condition necessitates escape. His family lives on a steady diet of sardines and miracle whip. Mangled toys lay in a broken heap by his toy box. So he looks to the only inspiration to fuel his dream: television. Where else would he glean these warped notions of Mexican culture from?When I read this book, I couldn't help but wonder if our protagonist was a byproduct of the author's ignorance, or of her brilliance. On one hand, we can surmise that Skippy's limited scope provides a direct lens into the feeble mind of the author. On the other hand, perhaps this book is a brutally accurate depiction of how culture is diffused through the American population that refuses to look beyond the light therapy box in every living room across this country. Generally speaking, American pop culture reduces all other cultures to endearing dogs, dancing candles with accents, etc. That's on one end of the spectrum anyway. On the other end of the spectrum, these same cultures are depicted as foreboding sources of crime, threats to social order, once they enter our borders. Skippy's fantasy is perpetuated by the endearing depiction of cultures. They remain outside our borders. We (Skippy) travel(s) to them, interact(s) with them, become their salvation under the guise of being one of their own, and then return home safely. Do you taste that? That's Joseph Campbell's hero's journey perverted by blind patriotism. Skippy isn't just a children's book about a cat uncertain of his identity. It is a book about the vitality of America's delusion of grandeur on a global scale, and with every sale the book reinforces the strength of this delusion."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/182393-maria", "userReview": "This is the worst kind of \"literature\" to expose your children to.

And I'm not the only one--it's won the EB White Read Aloud Book Award. And also, this is the sort of book I would have loved as a kid who loved interesting words and sounds. There are SO many fun-fun-fun things to say in this book! ;-p I won't give it away, but \"Skipyjon\" is just the beginning. Plus, the pictures are fun, the cats are cute, and it has a lot of absurdity and adventure and imagination. Also, I think bi-lingual (Spanish) learners would appreciate this, too, as it definitely has some South-of-the-Border flare and terms. Note, though, that there is some controversy about the book and that it presents negative stereotypes. I am usually sensitive to such things but this one slipped under my radar.

They love the character of Skippyjon Jones-- a Siamese cat who thinks he is a Chihuahua. I would agree that the play on words is worthwhile, but not at the expense of murdering the Spanish language.

As an American of Mexican ancestry, who happened to be born and grew up along the Texas-Mexican border (and currently resides in the same border town of El Paso), I didn't find it too difficult to step beyond the controversy and the \"lack of political correctness\" that many adult readers find in this children's book to see how witty, cute and funny Skippyjon's antics really are. He is after all, just a kitten of a cat. Sure there are stereotypes, but I didn't see them as being mean-spirited or anything that a real child wouldn't be guilty of doing in the spirit of \"innocent pretending.\" As a child, I might have created some of the same stereotypes Skippyjon did, especially in my speech. I speak English, \"Texan,\" Spanish, and Spanglish very well and can change my manner of speaking--my accent at will. I didn't find Skippyjon's accent offensive. He is trying to be a Chihuahua after all. As they say, \"Imitation is a sincere form of flattery and idolization.\" Skippyjon loves his Chihuahua alter ego and that is cool! (The only thing cooler than Skippito speaking Spanish, would have been Skippito speaking a few words in Nahuatl--the language of the Aztecs).After reading some of the posts, I am left wondering if as adults, we haven't created a world that is too sensitive? It seems to me that people get too easily offended these days. I guess it all depends on your perspective. Stereotypes exist everywhere. Stereotypes exist due to the fact that there is some truth to them. Stereotyping is normal. Treating others badly is not necessarily the result of stereotyping. Treating others badly comes from a lack of respect for others and for oneself. In my life, I have encountered prejudice, but it is not something I look for or dwell on. I am not hypersensitive about it and I certainly don't walk around with a prejudice radar on. Quite frankly if someone ever treats me badly, I just assume it is their issue--their personality--their shortcoming--their bad day---their problem. My culture and my ethnicity is part of who I am, but it doesn't define my core sense of humanity and beyond being respectful towards others and expecting the same in return, I don't worry about what people of my or other cultures, races or ethnicities think of me, my family or my ancestors. People will believe what they want to believe. My daughter and I picked up this book, because it came up on our search for Chihuahua at our local library. It was a fun little children's book. We hope the others are fun, too, and that we won't be left saying, \"Ay Chihuahua!\" (The only \"Ay Chihuahua, my daughters and I want to be saying is at the El Paso Chihuahuas Minor League Baseball Games.\") Seriously though, as adults, I think we need to find and draw a line between being sensitive towards others and being too sensitive and creating controversy where there really is none. Tossing out the book? Worrying if our Mexican or Hispanic friends would be offended? Cringing when we read it--because we know better? Being offended because we are Mexican or Hispanic of Mexican origin? (I think one has a right to be offended, but ONLY if we have never sterotyped anything lest you be a hypocite. If you (Hispanic or Mexican or even none of the aforementioned) have ever watched a movie where the bad guy/girl had black hair, dark eyes and dressed in black and agreed with this picture--guess what you have stereotyped--by this account most of the world's population is evil! If you have ever watched a movie or read a book where all rich people are mean and materialistic and agreed,...guess what you have stereotyped--not everyone of them is Scrooge! If you've ever laughed at a Texas drawl, immitated a Texas drawl or imagined Texans to be gun toting rednecks or cowboys who drive pick up trucks down dirt roads,...again you have stereotyped! I don't think I would find many non-hypocrites in this world when it comes to being offended by a stereotype!) Skippyjon Jones is a good little children's book about pretend. It is an entertaining story that can be used as a springboard to talk about stereotyping and not allowing our stereotypes to lead us to treat each other badly. (Of course, it can also be enjoyed for the sheer sense of enjoyment of a story about a small child's game of pretend--without getting into all the controversry of the book.) I find a lot of good in Skippyjon Jones. Without the Skippyjon's of this world these kinds of conversations and the learning that results from them disappear..,..how good would that be?e"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28467-kelly", "userReview": "While 1000+ GoodReads members seem to disagree, to me this book is rather offensive. It may have received the E. B. White Read Aloud award in 2004, but that doesn't mean it should be exempt from criticism. The racial stereotypes are awful (banditos -- really?!), the repeated reference to beans as if they are a defining characteristic of Latinos is insulting, and adding the letter 'o' and long 'ees' to random words to make them sounds more Spanish is disrespectful.

Along with his alternate personality he imagines he is in Mexico when he enters into this closet. In his closet he becomes a hero and confronts an enormous bumble bee aka as El Blimpo Bumblebeeto Bandito.  My first observation was that the media used appears to be chalk and charcoal. By lightly smudging the chalk, the drawings seem to have a soft texture. This enhances the fur on the kittens and Chihuahuas, the feathers on the birds, and the fuzzy bumblebee. By smearing the white chalk used to highlight the window panes, we can see a slight glare that creates an illusion of light reflecting across the glass. The colors used are a mixture of warm and cool hues. The warm colors, yellow, orange, and red go well with the \u2018Mexican\u2019 setting inside the closet. Of course Mexico is really only in Skippyjon\u2019s imagination, but the varied colors from one end of the spectrum to the other authenticate the festive atmosphere at a fiesta. When scenes are dominated by cool colors we see a siesta with darker blue and purple skies. This imparts a mood of restfulness. In another scene when the huge bumble bee passes overhead, the page is nearly covered by a light blue shadow cast by the bee. Within the bee\u2019s shadow smaller darker images of the fleeing Chihuahuas darken the page. You can feel the fear in the \u2018cool darkness,\u2019 as they scatter out of the range of the bumble bee. The lines in the story\u2019s art are mostly diagonal portraying action as the reader follows the bouncing Skippyjon from top to bottom across the story\u2019s pages. When the bumble bee is punctured by Skippyjon\u2019s sword the explosion is not only evident by the burst of lines suggesting the movement of beans flying everywhere. It turns out the bumble bee is really a pinata filled with jellybeans. The chaotic scene allows the reader to imagine the sound the beans would make as they rained down to the floor. Throughout the text, the dominate figure is Skippyjon and the bumble bee. When Skippyjon looks into his mirror and sees himself as a Chihuahua, we see the enlarged face of a real Chihuahua peering back. This is the only realistic drawing and emphasizes Skippyjon\u2019s belief that he is not a Siamese kitten, but a Chihuahua instead."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4756327-amy", "userReview": "I've picked up Skippyjon Jones off of the shelf at the library a few times thinking that I'd read it to the kids, but every single time I've put it back. When I read the book to myself I can't help but think, \"this story is ridiculous, and it makes no sense. I'll find something else.\" Well, today I just went ahead and took the book to the kids and read it to them. What I discovered is that when you read Skippyjon Jones aloud, the language and wordplay just pops to life. It crackles with vivacity, and it has a lyrical quality that compels the reader to modulate their voice with the undulation of the language. Reading Skippyjon Jones is like reading well-crafted poetry.The language is put together in such a fascinating way that it really kept the attention of my niece and nephew. Not only were they practicing rolling some of the words off of their tongues (and laughing at my efforts to do so--\"yip, yippee, yippito\" is *really* hard for me to say), but they were also enjoying the story that was being told. I have to admit, that when read aloud, the story made a lot more sense to me, too, and it was pretty cute.

Although when not rolling their eyes, they looked at me as if I was an idiot. I didn't care. I liked this story a bit more than the circus one, as this one seemed a little easier to understand.

It's 2017, and I shouldn't need to say it, but I'm gonna say it anyway - adding \"ito\" to the end of words is not Spanish. Even if it was a parody, which it is not, a 3 year-old is not picking up nuance like that (again, especially when it is non-existant).There are so many other choices for books that are hilarious when read, or that help kids learn another language, no need to waste time on this.
