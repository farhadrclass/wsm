Not only that, Maraniss wrote it brilliantly. It's one of the best biographies I've read."}, {"userName": "Clark Hallman", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12101662-clark-hallman", "userReview": "Clemente, by David Maraniss, is an excellent biography of Roberto Clemente. I have admired Roberto Clemente since I was a child and I still believe he was one of the greatest baseball players of all time. I was a hugh baseball fan (Pirates fan) from about age 8 through my 20s. I was lucky enough to see Clemente play at Forbes Field a few times when my boys baseball program in Hollidaysburg, PA provided bus \"field trips\" to a game in Pittsburgh each summer. Later, during the first few years I was a undergraduate student at Pitt, I attended many Pirate games where we sat in the bleacher seats in left field for a few dollars. Forbes Field was on the Pitt campus during those years. In July 1970, the Pirates moved to Three Rivers Stadium and I attended a few games there although it was more expensive and not as convenient. I wore Clemente's number when I played VFW baseball as a teenager. I was still a student at Pitt in the Fall of 1971 when the Pirates won the World Series against the Baltimore Orioles on October 17th in Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, and I was part of a huge celebration that filled the streets of Pittsburgh. Clemente was voted Most Valuable Player for that World Series. Unfortunately, I could not afford to attend any of those series games. This book reveals many details about Clemente's personal life as well as providing much detailed information about his eighteen seasons in the major league. Each season is covered including details about significant individual games. I particularly enjoyed the coverage of information about Clemente's relationships with other Pirate players, with Bob Prince (the voice of the Pirates), and with the sports press, who often misinterpreted his pride in himself, his race and his country. Also, it was great to read the detailed coverage of every game of the 1960 and 1971 World Series when the Pirates prevailed to become World Champions. Of course the tragic end of Clemente's life on December 31, 1972 due to the unethical and careless business practices of the air freight company and the failure of FAA safety policies and procedures brought back sad memories of Momen. However he died a hero's death in an attempt to help the people of Nicaragua after a devastating earthquake."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3872023-jim", "userReview": "This story is true to the book's subtitle \"The Passion and Grace of Baseball's Last Hero.\" It is well researched and the portrait it paints shows he lived as a devoted family man, world class athlete and a compassionate humanitarian, but was a proud man who found it difficult to suffer criticism. Clemente was a man who maximized his potential in all of it's many facets.He made a deep impression on his teammates. Steve Blass said, \"The rest of us were just players. Clemente was a prince.\" (pg. 256)As a player, he was capable of extreme feats. Roger Angell, baseball writer for the New Yorker, described Clemente's performance over the seven games of the 1971 World Series as \"something close to the level of absolute perfection.\" (pg. 264)Roberto expressed his philosophy of life in a speech in February 1971 when he said, \"If you have a chance to accomplish something that will make things better for the people coming behind you, and you don't do that, you are wasting your time on this earth.\" (pg.266) His life was an example of his philosophy, so much so that he died for it!One final quote, \"That night on which Roberto Clemente left us physically, his immortality began.\" (pg.339) I was impressed with Clemente before, but even more so after reading this book."}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/729425-kay", "userReview": "There were parts of this book that didn't interest me and I found myself easily laying it down and reading something else. It took me over 2 weeks to finish because until the last third I didn't have that urge to know what happened next. I found the baseball part a little boring and enjoyed the personal stuff. Those who know me will be shocked to know I found anything about baseball boring. Perhaps it was because he played for the Pirates which is one of my least favorite team or perhaps it was because so much of the baseball took place in the Winter league in Puerto Rica. Whatever! I think Clemente can easily be called a hero but the title suggests that he is the 'last hero' which I disagree with. There are many sports figures out there that are doing so much good for their communities."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1751300-richard", "userReview": "Roberto Clemente played professional baseball as well or better than many of his contemporaries who are today considered to be legends of the game. Many of those other legends were better known by the public at- large back then, partly because Clemente played for an underachieving team from the other, blue collar, Pennsylvania city with a pro ball club. For this reason, he never enjoyed the personal stardom or higher pay players were making in other markets. Nevertheless, as David Maraniss writes, Roberto Clemente played baseball with a skill and a passion that few other players can match.You must understand something of the obsession with baseball that existed in Puerto Rico in order to understand Clemente. Moraniss describes Roberto's upbringing in Carolina P.R., the youngest of seven children. Players for P.R.'s Professional Baseball League were his heroes, especially those who also played for the major leagues in the States. Clemente transitioned from P.R.'s amateur league to the Santuce Crabbers of the P.R. Professional Baseball League while a teenager. He came stateside with the Brooklyn Dodgers farm system and was drafted from there to the Pirates during November 1954. He continued to play for the Crabbers Winter League while with the Pirates. Clemente was not an instant star, although his talents were obvious from the beginning, including his powerful, accurate arm that he used to nail base runners as a right fielder. Going with a major league club was a source of great pride for someone from the baseball crazy Caribbean. He was not the first Latino player in MLB, but became the first Latino star. None of this came easy. He suffered through his entire career from back pains caused by a car accident while he was younger. He also had to endure the racial attitudes of the time, not only as a Latin player but as a black Latin player. When, for instance, his team played Spring practice in Florida each year, the rules of the segregated South required him to bunk in an ethnic part of town rather than being allowed to stay with the rest of his team in their hotel.Roberto was brought to the Pirates by Branch Rickey, who had forced the integration of MLB several years earlier when he had signed Jackie Robinson. Still, by the mid-fifties, some teams had not caught up with the times, including the team from the iron city. A team photo from that time shows Clemente and perhaps one other black player sitting among a sea of white faces. Clemente's personal sense of pride caused him to avoid the locker-room hijinks of his fellow players. This, plus the unfair rap of being a hypochondriac, due to his constant application of home remedies to his back problem and other ailments, and his lack of English fluency, gave him a reputation for being aloof. Most of this criticism was fostered by sports writers more than his fellow Pirates, although it would take time until a newer generation of younger players joined the team and respected him for his influence as role model and mentor. The stupid standards of sports writing drove Clemente to distraction at times. A vicious cycle developed in which Clemente constantly complained about the inaccurate coverage his playing received in the media, with sports reporters retaliating by labeling him \"Bobby Clemente\" and condescendingly reporting his quotes literally in his pronunciation, such as \"Bobby Clelmente says 'I heet ball good.'\" Many honors came to Roberto during his major league career, from 1955 to 1972. He was National League MVP in 1966. He had twelve Gold Gloves and led the National League in batting average four seasons. He was in 12 All-Star games. Maraniss' description of the 1960 World Series (the first of two in which Clemente played) was especially enjoyable reading. I can still remember seeing it as a teenager, back in the days when all World Series games were played in the daytime. Fans would hurry home from work or school to watch on their B-W TV's what remained of each game which, if I can remember, started at 2:00 or 3:00 PM EST. This series, which should have been a 4-game blowout, became one of the classics of all time. The always-struggling Pirates won the NL Pennant, and their reward was to face the New York Yankees, who won their 10th Pennant in 12 years. The goliath Yankees, with Yogi Berra, Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle, Elston Howard to name a few, were poised to overpower the Pirates in all departments. Strangely, they did just that but they couldn't put the Pirates away; during the seven games that the series lasted, they out-batted, out-hit and out-scored the Pirates by a wide margin. The trouble for the Yankees was that a lot of this hitting occurred during the two complete shutouts they won; the Pirates were able to eke out narrow wins to answer these two losses, and force the championship into a seventh game. Finally, at the end of the 9th inning in a tied game at Forbes Field, Bill Mazeroski hit a home run out of the park in one of the most memorable moments in Pittsburgh sports history, winning the series for the Pirates.Clemente hit safely in all seven games of that series, and also in the 1971 World Series against the Orioles, which Pittsburgh also won in seven games. Clemente became the first Lartino to win MVP in a World Series, in 1971. By that time, the Pirate team photo showed a diversity similar to the ethnic mix currently in MLB. He was always extremely popular with Pirates fans despite his problems with those who reported his playing; back home, he was accorded the respect of a national hero.Maraniss provides a compelling account of the details surrounding Clemente's death after the 1971 MLB season ended. He had managed Puerto Rico's team in the amateur world champoinship baseball series in Nicaragua. Shortly after, an earthquake hit the country, causing great damage and loss of life. Clemente had always practiced philantrophy on a level with his fierce pride. He sponsored several planeloads of relief supplies to Nicaragua, but these and the supplies sent by other relief organizations were diverted by the corrupt Samoza regime from the victims. Clemente chartered a plane in which he would personally travel so that some supplies would be delivered to those in need. Thanks to Maraniss's investigative efforts, he was able to unearth and make public federal court records which had been hidden from the public since 1972. Clemente, a devoted family man, left his home on New Years Eve 1972, in order to accompany his plane to Managua. Maraniss found records that showed that the 4-engined DC-7 which he chartered had been damaged recently and was basically unsafe; the pilot should have not have been allowed to fly the plane; and the plane was grossly overloaded prior to take-off. The result was that an engine caught fire immediately after the plane left the runway from Isla Verde P.R. The pilot tried to circle back to the airport while over water, but the plane crashed into the sea, killing Clemente and the crew. Despite the best efforts of the U.S. Coast Guard, no evidence of Roberto was found in the wreckage and debris that were eventually recovered. Maraniss makes the point that Clemente's playing record, including his three thousand hits and Gold Gloves would have ensured his entry into Cooperstown. The sports writers who voted on Baseball Hall of Fame inductions began an effort to induct Roberto without waiting for the normal five-year post-career period of inactivity and, eleven weeks after the process for this honor began, Roberto was voted overwhelmingly into Cooperstown. This was only the second time in baseball history that the time waiver for this honor was bestowed, joining Lou Gehrig's enshrinement in 1939. Clemente also became the first Latin American player to join this baseball elite.Maraniss acknowledges that the mythic aspects of baseball are commonly associated with past moments of sports glory and viewing enjoyment, but he makes the point that the mythic status of Clemente goes the other way, to the future. He was a model of what people can become, a symbol of action and passion, a breaker of racial and language barriers and the greatest example of the early Latino players in a game now dominated by Spanish-speaking athletes."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/201917-steve", "userReview": "It's a joy to pick up a baseball book at the start of the new season. Last year I adopted the Pittsburgh Pirates as my favorite team and I decided to learn more about their history. After browsing a few titles I landed on this biography of Roberto Clemente, Pittsburgh's most legendary player, and was off to the ballpark. I realized quickly that I didn't know much about Clemente, other than that he was a magnificent hitter, a strong-armed right fielder and that he died in a plane crash (sorry for the spoiler, but if you do not already know that about Roberto, there is a LOT for you to learn). Maraniss' work does a wonderful job of filling the wide swaths of life surrounding these moments with the depth of Clemente's personality. The subtitle of the book, The Passion and Grace of Baseball's Last Hero, I find to be a perfect one-line summation of Clemente's personality and the myth his early death left behind. We are taken back to the baseball circuits of Puerto Rico in the 1950's, when the sport captivated the island nation and a young Clemente began to make a name for himself by utilizing the canon affixed to his right shoulder. The story of his discovery is paralleled against the history of his Puerto Rican forbears in the big leagues. It's a much more tantalizing story that I anticipated. Once Clemente makes it to the US and the minor leagues, he is chaffed (to employ subtlety) by the harsh Jim Crow laws he encounters around the country, especially in the Pirates' spring training location in Florida. He comes from an island where race and skin color doesn't matter; instead people bond together with a strong love of Puerto Rico. Finally breaking through to the Majors, Clemente begins to show off his skills, but feels he is under-appreciated, possibly because of this nationality and skin color. This chip will be on his shoulder for almost his entire career, and will be the force driving his closer and closer to excellence. This force is his Passion. His accomplishments eventually become nothing short of remarkable on the field, but Clemente is set apart from other stars by his humanity off of it. He makes friends with fans, even inviting some to dinners and his home in Puerto Rico. He sometimes gets frustrated with sports writers and lashes out, only to accept his overreactions in time and apologize. He develops a consuming desire to build a \"sports city\" back home on the island to give poor children a chance to play sports and learn to succeed and develop self-worth. This humanity is his Grace. Clemente is by no means without his warts, and Maraniss is careful to portray this; he could be very moody, depressed over real or perceived slights and he could hold a grudge. This is an important layer to include in all biographical works where it is the case, to help contain the work as a study of a life and not let it burst into hagiography. I think this also helps us accept the famous person as a human being. Here the author does a good job. Overall, this is a very enjoyable read about one of the game's legendary players, and how a life and a story can become myth. (Pro tip: a tragic early death helps.) And it is a wonderful glance into a bygone (for better or worse) era of baseball and the history of the sport in the Caribbean. I definitely suggest it to all Pirates fans and baseball fans in general."}, {"userName": "Liz De Coster", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/258616-liz-de-coster", "userReview": "Maraniss is a sensitive writer, capable of creating a nuanced portrait of an icon. The book is a slightly uneasy blend of history and journalism, and each part brought strengths and also challenges to the overall work.He uses the Pittsburgh Courier to discuss the importance of black newspapers in covering black sports and athletes, contrasting the coverage of Clemente and other black and/or Latin players in that and other Pittsburgh papers serving the white communities; however, there are years that are barely mentioned in the book, which disrupts the narrative flow.He includes quotes from interviews of a tremendous range of individuals, but those people are often not contextualized until after their quotes appear, so the reader can be left feeling confused, thinking, \"Should I know who this person is and their significance/relevance to the story?\" And the end of the book is very abrupt, not discussing what happens to his family after his passing, his ongoing baseball legacies or records, etc.It's a solid biography, and one of a limited number of books about Clemente geared towards adult readers. But there's not as much about baseball or historic context as a typical reader would probably expect upon picking up the book."}, {"userName": "Scott Holstad", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9098678-scott-holstad", "userReview": "I became a Pirates fan when I moved from Canada to Pittsburgh in 1971 as a small boy with my family. I don\u2019t remember much of Roberto Clemente, but I remember how huge he was in the city. Willie Stargell was my favorite Pirate. Still, I remember when Clemente died on New Year\u2019s Eve, 1972, and what a shock it was to the world, to the baseball community, and to Pittsburgh, and what a sense of loss it brought.Maraniss writes a pretty good book about Clemente. It\u2019s not perfect, but the highlights are well written and one learns a lot about the man. Coming from Puerto Rico up to Montreal, in the minors, around 1954 was a huge shock for him, and then when the Pirates drafted him from the minors in 1955, it continued to be a culture shock for him, not only as a Latino player, but as a black Latino player. Since Spring Training was in Florida, Clemente was exposed first hand to Jim Crowe laws and couldn\u2019t stay with the team, eat with the team, do anything but stay in the \u201ccolored\u201d sections of towns and play ball. He wasn\u2019t an immediate star, but he was obviously talented. He had a rocket for an arm and played a mean right field. He could hit fairly well, and with some power. He was primed for stardom.By the time 1960 rolled around, the Pirates had risen from mediocre to National League champs, but they had to play the dreaded Yankees (with Mantle and Maris) in the World Series. And NY bombed Pittsburgh in three games by huge margins. Nonetheless, Pittsburgh won three games too, setting up a seventh and deciding game. The game was tied going into the ninth inning. Finally, at the end of the ninth inning, Bill Mazeroski hit a home run out of the park in one of the most famous moments in Pittsburgh sports history, winning the Series for the Pirates. It was the \u201cshot heard round the world,\u201d and to this day, is probably the most readily remembered World Series home run. For the Series, Clemente hit safely in every game.Now my complaint with the author comes into play. He basically skips entire seasons after that Series. The 1967 season isn\u2019t even mentioned, and Clemente was the 1966 National League MVP. You\u2019d think Maraniss would want to follow up on that. Also, while we learn about Clemente\u2019s tempestuous relationship with the press, who really never truly understood him, we don\u2019t get as much on his relationship with the team, such as his manager Danny Murtaugh. It would have been nice to read more about their interactions. Finally, we come to another good chapter \u2013 the one on the 1971 World Series against Baltimore, a team with four 20 game winning pitchers. By this time, Clemente was the old man on the team, but he hit safely in all seven games of this Series too, and was named Series MVP as Pittsburgh won another World Series.In all, Clemente finished his career with a .317 batting average, 3000 hits, four N.L. batting titles, 12 Gold Gloves, the 1966 National League MVP, the 1971 World Series MVP, and was the first Latino elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.At the end of 1972, there was a devastating earthquake in Nicaragua, a country where Clemente had just managed the Puerto Rican national team in a playoffs. He was determined to help the people and helped gather over $100,000 and hundreds of tons of supplies to take to Nicaragua for disaster relief. Unfortunately, he put his trust in a shady character who had a plane he contracted out. This guy had 66 FAA violations and couldn\u2019t even fly the plane, even though he was the co-pilot. The pilot had 12 violations and was exhausted from a trip he had just taken. Additionally, the plane was in bad shape and had been wrecked just two weeks before. Finally, it was overloaded by something like 4,500 pounds. It could barely lift off the ground. Nonetheless, Clemente said goodbye to his wife and three boys, took off, and never made it, as the planed crashed into the ocean shortly after takeoff, smashing everything to smithereens. His body was never found.Roberto Clemente was the pride of the Latino world, could have ruled Puerto Rico, was much loved by kids around the world, who he related to quite well, and had millions of fans everywhere. While he didn\u2019t always get along with the press, they decided to do something that had only been done once before \u2013 bypass the five year minimum requirement of being away from baseball for election into the Baseball Hall of Fame (the other player was Lou Gehrig), and he was elected 11 weeks after his death.It\u2019s a good book, even though it does leave details out. (Why did Clemente give one of his Silver Slugger awards to announcer Bob Prince?) It\u2019s well researched and documented and it sheds light on one of the greatest athletes of our time. Clemente will never be forgotten, and I certainly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Aaron Million", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6871223-aaron-million", "userReview": "This was an uneven flowing book. Maraniss skips certain time periods without any explanation. Example: the 1967 season is not even mentioned. Yet, Clemente had won the 1966 NL MVP. I would like to know why 1967 did not even get a nod from Maraniss. The time from when Clemente was a young boy up to when he went to Montreal to play minor league baseball for the Dodgers is not really discussed. What went on then? Maraniss does not delve into Clemente's relationships with most of the people in his life. For example: Clemente's relationship with Danny Murtaugh (the Pirates manager for the majority of Clement's career) was rocky at the beginning. And then... well, Maraniss really never discusses it further. What were Clemente's feelings when Murtaugh retired in 1964, then came back in 1968? Then retired for the final time after the 1971 World Series? I think that could have been fleshed out much more than it was. Another example: Bob Prince (the iconic and long-time announcer for the Pirates) and Clemente seemed to respect each other quite a bit, but Maraniss again does not dive into this other than to say \"Prince treated him fairly.\" How? By his commentary during games? Clemente invited Prince to his home and gave him one of his Silver bats that he received for winning a batting title. I think that is a pretty big deal. Yet, Maraniss does not explain exactly why Clemente liked Prince so much.The chapter on the 1960 season was riveting - I thought it was easily the best part of the book. Maraniss writes that chapter with a dramatic flare that kept me grossly intrigued throughout those pages. Yet, the chapter on the 1971 season paled in comparison. The background of the old, over-loaded plane that contributed to Clemente's untimely death, and the perfect storm of greed and incompetence that led to him needing to get on that plane, is well-documented by Maraniss. Tragic ending to a life that, despite accomplishing so much already, seemed destined for even bigger and better things."}, {"userName": "Cheryl Gatling", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4604883-cheryl-gatling", "userReview": "I wanted to read about Roberto Clemente after he was mentioned in a Freakonomics episode about how we speak of the dead. Clemente was used an example of a man who may have been complicated in life, but became sanctified in memory because of his death in the service of humanity. Freakonomics suggested that perhaps Clemente was not really such a great baseball player, or perhaps great at times, but not putting in 100% all the time. The Clemente of Maraniss's book was a great ball player all the time. He \"ran like he had been set on fire by the flames of hell.\" He got hits on bad pitches. Balls dropped from the air into his basket glove, and he fired them strait and true to where they needed to be. It is mentioned that he was accused of being a hypochondriac, but Maraniss explains that he suffered some severe and legitimate medical problems, including a car accident that gave him chronic back pain, and a bout with malaria that weakened him. Maraniss's Clemente is complicated in other ways, though. He smoldered with resentment at slights real and imagined. He bristled against sportswriters. He felt unappreciated. He once inexplicably slugged an autograph seeker, knocking three of his teeth loose. And yet, he was a devoted friend, and always cared about helping poor people. His death while bringing relief supplies to Nicaraguan earthquake victims is inspiring, but it is also maddening. The affair was a perfect storm of incompetence. The plane was unsafe. The crew was inexperienced. The plane was overloaded. Clemente shook hands, asked no questions, and said, \"They know what they are doing.\" If he had hired a reputable carrier, he probably would have lived. It was very sad. His desire to help was admirable, and an example for us all, but a touch of worldly cynicism in the process would have gone a long way. But overall, Maraniss argues that Clemente deserves his reputation both as a great ball player and a great man."}, {"userName": "David Bales", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2007954-david-bales", "userReview": "Poignant, sad, moving story of the greatest right fielder of his generation, Roberto Clemente, Puerto Rican national hero and star player of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 to 1972.

Clemente, himself was one of my favorite stars of the game and the author of this book gave me so much to enhance my appreciation of the player, and so much more of the character of the man. Clemente indeed had his rough points and flaws which were reported in the pages of the book. However, the true heart of Roberto Clemente was shown to overshadow those idiosyncrasies. Maraniss\u2019 descriptions of Roberto Clemente\u2019s baseball skills, his style of play and team commitment were done well. His game-by-game accounts of the 1960 and 1972 World Series\u2019 were outstanding allowing me to relive the exciting play. The inclusion the players of the era, both great and incidental in the game of baseball gave me a nostalgic recall of listening to games on the radio in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. The author also gave sobering renderings of the struggles of black and Latin players emerging in what had been a white man\u2019s game. Then in the picture of the horrific earthquake that struck Nicaragua and its aftermath that caused Clemente to want to bring humanitarian relief, Maraniss gave an excellent short history of the Central American Country. Even as I read about the Pittsburg Pirate\u2019s most celebrated right fielder and his life story I knew well his tragic ending. The thought of the eventual plane crash that ended his life kept entering my mind as I read through the pages of the book. Reading the details in the final chapters that I had not known saddened me even more so. David Maraniss balanced the descriptions and relationships of baseball, family, friends, fans, kids, community, media, people in need, sense of honor, and even pride in the account of the Puerto Rican icon.Roberto Clemente had a heart for the suffering people of Nicaragua devastated by the earthquake. He had organized a relief organization to bring food and medical supplies to the thousands of hurting evacuees of Managua. He took it upon himself to be aboard a chartered plane to accompany to supplies in order to make sure they got to those who needed them upon arrival. Clemente\u2019s fate was determined by a faulty, unbalanced, over loaded aircraft, flown by a troubled pilot with lack of sleep, and an unqualified copilot and flight engineer. Upon leaving San Juan, Puerto Rico the aircraft never got off the ground more than 200 feet before crashing into the ocean killing all four on board including Clemente. Not much was mentioned in Maraniss\u2019 book of Clemente\u2019s spiritual life although as told, Clemente\u2019s oft repeated refrain was, \u201cIf you have a chance to make life better for others, and fail to do so, you are wasting your time on this earth.\u201d At his memorial those attending were given programs having the words of his mother\u2019s spiritual refrain: \u201cOnly God makes man happy. Life is nothing. Everything ends. Only God makes man happy.\u201dThis book was well worth the read not only for the baseball enthusiast but for the story of a man with a life well lived.

Clemente was larger than life even while alive.Clemente was peevish and tended toward whiny. But that wasn't without reason because he had suffered segregation and discrimination. He didn't get endorsements the way white players did. He didn't get the same accolades (though in part that's because the Pirates were not a big market team). Even worse, and Maraniss comes back to it numerous times with quotes, the press routinely quoted him in phonetics. English was his second language and it became caricatured (\"Eef I can geet better...\") and justifiably made him mad.Maraniss depicts the extreme and disgusting corruption of the Somoza government when it sucked up all the aid it could for profit and let people go hungry after the 1972 earthquake. Clemente was angry and that compelled him even more to take the trip to Nicaragua so that he could force the aid where it needed to go. Roberto Clemente could (and would) stand up to a dictator. He was a real role model, on and off the field. He was an elite player who was idolized by both African American and Latino teammates. He was a fan favorite and a devoted family man.Maraniss gives substantial attention to the history of the DC-7 that took him into the Caribbean shortly after takeoff. I had no idea about any of it, and I felt impotent and useless anger at the owner, who was both stupid and negligent. Many people knew that plane shouldn't be flown. I don't know about being baseball's \"last\" heroes but Clemente was one of its greatest.From http://weeksnotice.blogspot.com/2018/..."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4452844-andrew", "userReview": "A reminder that good writing in any genre is worth reading and that I should add more sports books to my queue. To me, what makes good sports writing is that an author can also capture the context of the times and this author does a good job at this. In particular, he was able to capture the rampant racism that faced Clemente and other Latin and black players during spring training and the less overt (but still there) racism that carried on into the north in the 1960s. In today's terms, it's shocking that writers would write Clemente's comments in \"Puerto Rican\" English. The author skips the 1967 season where Clemente's numbers were as equally comparable to his MVP-1966 season, but he finished 3rd in the MVP voting. In fact, his numbers were mostly better than the winning MVP, Orlando Cepeda, his Puerto Rican protege.Definitely, a well-written and researched book capturing the multi-faceted face of a great ballplayer and by all accounts a good man."}, {"userName": "Ted Daniels", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73386163-ted-daniels", "userReview": "This book is more than a biography of a sports hero.

Clemente died as he lived, a man who passionately loved his countrymen and fellow Latinos regardless of their skin color, particularly those who didn't have the opportunities he did.He was in the twilight of his career at the end of the 1972 season, having collected his 3,000th hit on his last at bat as a Pittsburgh Pirate, an accomplishment that only 10 other men had achieved before him. He was finally at peace with himself, after suffering innumerable slights and insults throughout his career, by managers and fellow players who didn't understand or appreciate him, racial segregation and deplorable living conditions during spring training in Florida, and sportswriters who twisted and phoneticized his Spanish-flavored words in demeaning and hurtful articles. He led the Pirates to two World Series, and was respected and feared as one of the most dangerous clutch hitters in baseball, who ran as if he was being chased by demons and threw out runners regularly from his right field position due to a strong and deadly accurate arm. A complex man who wore his emotions on his sleeves, he would regularly berate and harangue reporters for seemingly innocent questions, yet he would routinely sign autographs for his fans long after his teammates had left the ballpark, and gave freely of himself to anyone he could help, including the poor of San Juan and surrounding towns in Puerto Rico and fans who he embraced and treated as if they were his own family.Clemente spent his winters playing in Puerto Rico and throughout the Caribbean and Latin America while other major leaguers were resting, to give back to those Latinos who could not see him play in Pittsburgh, and to honor the Latino players that came before him but could not display their talents in the United States, due to their skin color or language barrier. He worshiped his wife, children and parents above all else, and never forgot or forsake his roots as a kid growing up in a poor town outside of San Juan. He was beloved by fans of all races and backgrounds throughout the United States, for his skill, passion for the game, and the love he gave to every fan that supported him. (As a side note, he was one of my favorite players as a kid, along with Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Bob Gibson, and my friends and I would routinely mimic the neck stretches he did before every at bat.)David Maraniss does an excellent job in honoring and fully describing Roberto Clemente, a complicated and imperfect man who continues to be viewed as a hero in Puerto Rico, other countries in Latin America, and the city of Pittsburgh, as a pioneer who overcome physical pain and personal strife to become one of baseball's greatest and most beloved figures. However, the book was overly repetitive and about 50-100 pages too long, which diluted its impact somewhat. Despite this, I would highly recommend this book, certainly to baseball fans but also to anyone who would enjoy a well written biography about an influential and beloved man."}, {"userName": "Theo Logos", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9793933-theo-logos", "userReview": "Roberto Clemente was a legendary ballplayer - a .317 career batting average, 3000 hits, four N.L. batting titles, twelve gold gloves, 1966 National League MVP, 1971 World Series MVP, and the first Latino elected to the Hall of Fame. Impressive as these statistics and facts may be, they cannot capture Roberto's greatness. To try to capture Clemente this way, David Maraniss writes, \"is like chemists trying to explain Van Gogh by analyzing the ingredients of his paint. Clemente was art, not science...it was hard to take one's eyes off him\". Maraniss' new biography of Clemente, (the first since shortly after he died) captures the many facets of this complex man who truly did live his life both on and off the diamond with passion and grace.Where the earlier Clemente biographies, written shortly after his death, were little more that tributes and eulogies for the fallen hero, Maraniss writes of the man in all his complexity, and though he deservedly calls him a hero, he does not treat him as a saint. Notoriously thin skinned and prickly, Clemente had a career-long feud with the press. Though it was aggravated by the racism of the time, (Clemente was infuriated when the press would quote his interviews using phonetic spelling to capture his accent) and the language barrier, his sensitive personality, often perceiving slights where they were not intended, was equally to blame. He was obsessed with his health and ailments, complaining constantly about his pain, and some accused him of being a goldbricker and a hypochondriac, yet he seemed to play at his best when in his greatest pain, and ended his career breaking the record for most games played in a Pirates uniform. He constantly and vociferously complained about how he did not get the recognition that he deserved, and played every game like it was the seventh game of the World Series.Clemente was baseball's last hero, not just for his greatness on the field, but for his life off the baseball diamond. He constantly (and quietly) visited children in hospitals throughout his career, both in the states, and in his beloved Puerto Rico. He dreamed of building a sports city for the children of Puerto Rico (a dream fulfilled after his death). He paved the way for Latin players in the major league, and mentored many of them throughout his career. He once said, \"If you have a chance to accomplish something that will make things better for people coming behind you, and you don't do that, you are wasting your time on this earth\", and he lived by that line. And of course, he died a hero's death, attempting to bring aid to victims of Nicaragua's earthquake. Steve Blass, Clemente's teammate, put it best - \"The rest of us were just players - Clemente was a prince.\"Maraniss has written a worthy biography that is more than just a sports book. The incredible character that Clemente was - the passionate grace with which he lived his life, and the heroic way in which he lost it should interest even those only marginally interested in baseball. I highly recommend it to all."}, {"userName": "Gene", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1663112-gene", "userReview": "Maraniss did a great job of bringing my earliest baseball memories back to life for me. It felt great just reading the names that I had read hundreds of times in my youth when going through our baseball cards. The book really shines when it describes the World Series games that Clemente was a part of. I was reminded that baseball really is a great game and filled with suspense and tension, even though I have come to find cricket a better game. I see I was not mistaken to be so in love with baseball as a child.Another strong part of the book is the description of the struggles that Black and Latin American players had in making their way to the majors as well as how life was so hard for them because of the discrimination that they faced, especially in the South. It was good for me to have a fresh reminder of that.And then there was Clemente himself and the chance to really get to know him again. Perhaps, better to say, get to know him for the first time. The only other book I had read about him was written for youth and was more of a hagiography. This biography brought him to life as a real person with character flaws as well as genuine charm. The book veered off track significantly in the end when Maraniss vents his hatred for Nixon, the Somaza family, and Howard Hughes. I think he's written so much about politics in his lifetime that he couldn't resist tying these evil characters into the plot. I'm no fan of any of them, and I'm not defending them or saying they should not be criticized. I'm only saying that a book about Clemente doesn't seem to be the place to do so.Another more minor irritant is the way the book seems to reintroduce certain people over and over again, as if for the first time. I wonder how many times I have to be told who Vic Powers is and what his relationship to Clemente was.And I'm proud to have this be the first book ever given to me by my son, William. He knew #21 has always been my favorite and that I've always considered Clemente to be the finest baseball player ever. It takes nerve to purchase a book for a book lover, but that he dared to do so and also was able to make a good choice shows how close we still are, even though he lives halfway around the world from me."}, {"userName": "Len", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/99896-len", "userReview": "I try to begin each baseball season with a baseball book and this year it was an easy choice -- David Maraniss' bio of Roberto Clemente was at the top of my list. Clemente died in 1972 just as I was beginning to fall in love with baseball, so I didn't get a chance to see him play nor did I really know much about him other than the fact that he died tragically in a plane crash. This book was an eye-opener on many fronts.To begin, there is no question Clemente was a true hero in every sense of the word, especially to the people of his native Puerto Rico. when he wasn't thinking about baseball or playing baseball, he was helping others -- not just in Puerto Rico but everywhere. His most famous quote was: \"if you have a chance to help others, and don't, then you are wasting your time on this earth.\"Clemente was orginally drafted by the Dodgers, but they didn't think he was ready for the majors and hid him in Montreal where they hoped nobody would notice him. But when they left him unprotected in the Rule 5 draft the next year, the lowly Pirates snapped him up with the first overall pick. Over the next 18 years he led the Pirates to two world championships and knocked out 3,000 hits, won a trophy case full of gold gloves and cemented his position as one of the greatest players of all time. But none of that seems important when you reflect on what he meant to both latin players and black players that followed.Clemente was one of the first black player on the Pirates, but he was also one of the first great latin players in the majors. As a black latin he dealt with twice as much racism in the U.S., even though he was proud to play in America and signed up to be a Marine reservist. In spring training in Florida, he had to endure Jim Crow racism and in Pittsburgh he had to overcome the largely white population. He always spoke out and became a hero to black and latin players that followed him.Maraniss is a wonderful storyteller and he brings Clemente's life alive. It's an amazing life and a tragic life, but altogether a great life and a story worth reading whether you are a baseball fan or not."}, {"userName": "Rossrn Nunamaker", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1044243-rossrn-nunamaker", "userReview": "I finished Clemente: The Passion and Grace of Baseball's Last Hero by David Maraniss. What a wonderful book.I was interested in this as a Pirates fan and from my little knowledge of Clemente as a player and humanitarian who lost his life tragically.What I learned was much on many levels. In one regard the book provided a social commentary on America from the 1950s through the early 1970s, but it did so through the perspective of a man who was black, but also Puerto Rican. The distinction being Clemente grew up without racism in his homeland, and only experienced it upon coming to America to play baseball at a young age (18/19). His being Puerto Rican also distinguished his being black, because he spoke Spanish, not English and didn't \"fit in\" with the few black players in the league at that time who'd grown up in America with racism.The conditions in which these players played and the approach they took over time to be treated as equal peers was eye opening from the standpoint that it was presented in a way that you could see it and feel it. It also seemed closer to me from the perspective that I didn't ever get a chance to see Clemente play, but did see many of his teammates.There was also Clemente as a man. Stories of the friends he made including a girl from Bethlehem, were remarkable. He lived reasonably modestly in America and seemed to make friends with fans and those he viewed to be \"underdogs\" everywhere. He had a passion for helping children, especially those underprivileged and undergoing serious medical issues. He was also fiercely proud of his heritage and homeland. The book was fair in that it also revealed he was not perfect. He had outbursts. He would curse. He could throw a punch.And of course there was Clemente the ballplayer. It was great (especially given the Pirates accomplishments since about 1979) to read about the seasons in which he played including 1960 and 1971 when the team won the World Series.Coming to the end of the book was sad. You knew the ending.

This book covers the entire life and tragic death of the baseball star in great detail, but maybe even a little too much detail. Unless you're a huge Clemente fan (although what baseball fan isn't in some way), you are going to find it hard to push yourself through this entire book. The only reason I may have been able to finish is because of my interest in the subject.The book spends way too much time discussing the early life of Clemente. Many readers want to get right to the action and taking multiple pages to discus Clemente\u2019s sister, who died at an early age, and is only mentioned once is completely unnecessary. The way the author described things like this was a positive thing in some ways. All of the parts I did find interesting, for example the final minutes of Clemente\u2019s life, were described in fantastic detail. I felt very satisfied after reading a section, not needing anymore facts or stories from Clemente\u2019s life, which is what I hope the author intended to do. If presented with the opportunity to read another book by the same author, I would unfortunately have to think about it. If it was a book on someone I looked up to, someone I wanted to find more about, then yes, I would definitely read it. However, if it were to be on someone not of great interest, the way the author rants and rants on details would make it very hard to want to pick up the book.
