Although working again with his friend, Detective D'Agosta, Pendergast shows little interest, taking it for the punishment it is meant to be. But then, more headless corpses, beheaded of wealthy New Yorkers, men who have the best security money can buy. Yet, someone is managing to penetrate these systems. Pendergast for much of the book is working in the background, his ghostly presence shadowing D'Agosta, at odds with the city's theory of why these killings are taking place.It is with welcome relief I welcome back a Pendergast story that doesn't include any of his nefarious and very strange family. Not that I do not find them interesting but though with the previous books this subject had been overdone. This is back to form, Pendergast doing what he does best. Seeing things others do not see,putting things together in a way other cannot. Though in this one there s the very real possibility that Pendergast has met his match. Someone he cannot out think, anticipate. The scene in the old asylum, the cat and mouse game that ensues was suspenseful and harrowing. I won't say this is the best in series, but I do think it is the best in the last several years.

They dart into an old abandoned property and dive into a pile of leaves that have blown into a darkened corner. Their temporary refuge smells of mold and something definitely rank. The leaves shift with their squirming and a dead body reveals itself. The source of the screaming comes from the boys themselves......never a peep from the headless one.Preston & Child present their 17th book in the Pendergast Series. Not to worry, though. City of Endless Night reads as a stellar standalone with only tiny dots of the past. You most certainly can hit the ground running with this one. It's that good.Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta of the NYPD is called to that decaying warehouse late that night. He's the lead detective assigned to this horrendous case. While sifting through that leaf fondue, D'Agosta raises his head and finds FBI Special Agent A.X.L. Pendergast crouched low on the floor. The two men agree that this young woman was killed elsewhere and brought to the scene. Nothing to hang a hat on......there's a missing head that doesn't show up in that leafy mound.The unfortunate victim turns out to be Grace Ozmian, a young socialite living the high life on daddy's billions. Kinda makes you scratch your own head as to how she ended up here in a bad way. The questions keep piling up as the body count rises.......wealthy individuals who lose their heads much like ol' Grace. They won't be spending another nickel on this earth. Uh, that's for sure.To complicate things even more, Preston & Child add the likes of an overzealous journalist who seems to have his own theory for the crimes. Bryce Harriman is digging into his own pile of trouble as he tries to uncover past lives of the victims. It may cost him his own.City of Endless Night is one of the best in this series so far. D'Agosta is written this time around as front and center with our Pendergast more on the peripheral until the end. It's an enjoyable fast read in which you won't come up for air for some time. (Recommend snacks and beverages close by) The Epilogue is quite enticing, too. A promise of more good stuff to come......

I so enjoyed every page turning moment as I sped through this book in a day. Pretty much proof of the \"I can't put it down\" aura of this novel.Aloysius Pendergast and Vincent D'Agosta are are on the trail of a killer. A young wealthy woman has been murdered and grisly details are found when her corpse is discovered headless in an abandoned warehouse. This will not be the last crime of this type as these two team up together to find the murderer and ultimately discover the motive behind these killings. Could the motive be a pay back for crimes committed by the victims, or is it a rage against the one percenters that inhabit New York City where the murders have taken place? Perhaps there is something else driving this murderer and his quest for killings and beheadings. As always Pendergast and D'Agosta are up against evil forces as they try to stop the killings and manage also to save themselves from the same fate.

My personal favorite is the ones that have a slight supernatural element to the story like the first book Relic with the monster in the New York Museum of Natural History, which is why I felt a bit disappointed while reading this one. Don't take me wrong, it's a great thriller, and it's nice to have D'Agosta and Pendergast working together to catch a murderer.However, it feels just like an ordinary thriller. Sure, the killings and beheadings is an interesting mystery especially since there seems to be no link to the people killed. I just wished that the book had been a bit more extraordinary. Instead, we get a straight-forward thriller, with not a very memorable killer. Well, besides the fact that this is one of the first times that Pendergast goes up against an enemy that seriously could outsmart him. The best part of the book is the end part when the killer and Pendergast face-off and Pendergast truly has to fight for his life against an enemy that is better than him. And, yes that is a very unusual scene since Pendergast is someone that often seems more than human.City of Endless Night is a good thriller, as always is the writing great and, despite my reservations about the story, did I enjoy reading the book. It's only that I really enjoy when the stories take a more suspenseful feeling when Pendergast is up against something beastly and since the killer in this book is an ordinary killer (well he was psycho, but still very much human) did I get a bit disappointed. \nNevertheless, it's not a bad book, never boring and I enjoyed both the main story and the side stories.\n I want to thank Grand Central Publishing for providing me with a free copy through NetGalley for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "Steven", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11855472-steven", "userReview": "Thanks to Netgalley and Grand Central Publishing for providing me a copy of this to read in exchange for an honest review.So as many of you know, the Pendergast series is one of my longest followed and most beloved series. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good thriller with adventure and strangeness mixed right in. This wasn't the strongest entry into the series, what with a relatively predictable villain and a meandering plot with some side stories that felt unnecessary, but it was still a Pendergast book... and one thing that seriously redeemed it was that we got to see a side of Pendergast we haven't seen very deeply before -- and he was VULNERABLE. Pendergast has always been one of those \"step ahead of everyone\" kind of characters, and it's part of his charm. He's crazy smart, can read people, and knows how to play them to get what he wants... but the events of the last book really brought him into a new realm, and this book played on that new weakness and vulnerability to show this side of Pendergast, and to almost bring him down to a normal human. Of course, it was awesome to see him struggle and find his mastery again, but it was an absolute pleasure to get to see him accept that maybe he's not always the smartest person in the room or the best player in the game.I think that brought a fresh new perspective to the character, who after 17 books could be at risk of getting stale, right? Who am I kidding? Pendergast is the bomb.Read this one. It's fun.

While it doesn't move the overall \"mythology\" of the series along, it does provide a complex thriller with further insights into Pendergast's character, and it can be read as a standalone, set in New York City, featuring the the extremely wealthy and the extremely not. Pendergast himself is strangely out of sorts as the story opens, having difficulty involving himself in solving the initial crime (perhaps due to developments at the end of the last book), showing a level of decreased insight lacking in his crime solving.D'Agosta and Pendergast are teamed up again due to the discovery of a headless corpse, a crime scene involving one or possibly two distinct killers. And they soon learn that the victim is prominent and wealthy, though also notorious. Who would want her dead -- and in that way?

I still look forward to each new one, but each new entry has less going for it than the last. (In my opinion, the good ones have been Relic, Reliquary, The Cabinet of Curiosities, Still Life with Crows, the Diogenes Trilogy, and White Fire.)Why the decline? Firstly, I think too much Pendergast is a bad thing. The books where he wasn't the sole protagonist are usually much better than the ones where he is. He's much more fun when he has to share the stage with someone more normal, like D'Agosta, or Nora, or Corrie or Margo. Spending too much time on Pendergast takes the luster off of his mystery and makes him look like the genre power fantasy that he is. How many times do we need to hear about how expensive his handmade shoes are? I for one, am sick of that.Secondly, the authors are clearly sick of the character, and it shows in how little life each book has now. The villains and side characters have grown sadly forgettable. There's hardly any atmosphere. I really would have liked to *feel* more during City of Endless Night, and when I think about how much promise the villain and setting had, I feel like I should have. Even though this villain was clearly competent and dangerous, certainly a match for Pendergast, the last time I felt that Pendergast was in any real danger was back in Reliquary--that moment when he's getting ready to go into underground Manhattan, and the narrator describes him as \"the last of the great explorers.\" You really felt it at that moment, that the book was taking you somewhere original, exotic, and dangerous.I'll keep reading, because when you've grown up with a series it's hard to let go, and they're still entertaining books. And the publication of worse books doesn't mean that the early books magically disappear. I can always reread my favorites with no loss of appreciation. It just makes me a bit sad, that's all. I wish the authors would start a new series starring Corrie instead."}, {"userName": "Bam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam", "userReview": "Even after seventeen books, the Pendergast series is endlessly fascinating! This thriller takes place in NYC and begins with the discovery of the headless body of a young woman. FBI Special Agent Pendergast is called in to help D'Agosta and the NYPD because it appears she may have been transported across state lines. It turns out the victim is the only child of a ruthless tech billionaire, and when other wealthy people are killed in similar ways, the mayor puts the heat on the NYPD to come up with some answers quickly. But it is an ambitious young reporter named Harriman who suggests the theory that captures the public's imagination--that the serial killer is targeting 'one-percenters' in what he calls 'the city of endless night.' Pendergast's is the only dissenting voice but he is not sharing his reasons. Who will be the next wealthy victim if no one can stop 'the Decapitator?'Exciting reading with a nice plot twist that I did not see coming!

Many thanks to Grand Central Publishing!As a fan of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's 'Agent Pendergast' series, I am always eagerly awaiting each book. The latest, City of Endless Night is the 17th book in the series and as usual, the excitement builds quickly. The story begins at a crime scene in Queens, New York on a cold December night where Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta of the NYPD and his crew have been called to investigate the murder of a young woman whose body was discovered in an abandoned garage.... oh, and the body just happens to be headless! Lurking on the periphery of the crime scene, as is his habit, is FBI Special Agent Aloysius X.L. Pendergast. Pendergast... eccentric, unconventional and seemingly genetically incapable of following FBI protocol, has partnered with D'Agosta, solving numerous crimes in the past. If you're a regular reader of the Pendergast series and in particular, if you have read the previous book, The Obsidian Chamber, then you're aware that because of Pendergast's handling (perhaps MISHANDLING) of a case involving his own brother, Diogenes, he has fallen into disfavor with his superiors at the Bureau. He has been sent to this crime scene in Queens as a kind of punishment; but after wandering around the crime scene with his usual test tubes and tweezers, he discovers an overlooked clue.. a minute piece of evidence which piques his interest and the hunt for the killer begins....The NYPD has no sooner identified the body of the headless young woman as Grace Ozmian, socialite daughter of tech billionaire Anton Ozmian, when another headless body is found. This body is that of former New Jersey Attorney General-turned- Mob lawyer, Marc Cantucci. The discovery of Marc Cantucci in his secure fortress-like homes just the beginning. Over the weeks leading up to the Christmas holiday more headless bodies will be discovered... a former Russian international arms broker and husband and wife CEOs of LFX Financial.As the bodies continue to stack up and the NYPD is scrambling for a break in the case, the city begins to descend into hysteria and panic. Of course, this hysteria is fueled by reporter for 'The New York Post', Bryce Harriman. Harriman, whose career has been floundering, came upon an idea to attract much needed attention to his newspaper and himself. On Christmas Day,he publishes a story in which he takes the NYPD and the FBI to task for not yet finding the killer or killers. Harriman writes that he is sure a serial killer is targeting members of the 1% of New York society... the \"exceedingly rich, flagrantly corrupt and entirely reprehensible.\" Harriman also says that the killer(s) is sending a message to \"mend your ways before it is too late.\"Harriman's article has the desired effect of creating a climate of hysteria and setting off protests against the 1% throughout the city. The pressure begins to build on the NYPD to finally solve the case. Was Harriman correct... was a serial killer stalking the 1% of New York Society in their heavily guarded and protected homes? Maybe...... maybe not.The thrilling hunt for this diabolical killer takes Lieutenant D'Agosta and Special Agent Pendergast across the city... from Queens to Manhattan and culminating in a shocking, nail-biting confrontation with a madman at King's Park Psychiatric Center on the north shore of Long Island... an abandoned psychiatric hospital, known for its cruel electroconvulsive shock therapy. Will D'Agosta and Pendergast survive the hunt for this cruel and crafty killer?....... I thoroughly enjoyed this latest installment in the Pendergast series and I have to confess that in addition to reading the print copy provided by Grand Central Publishing, I also listened to the audiobook version and the phenomenal narration provided by Rene Auberjonois (as always!) . Now, I begin the wait for the next book in the series......"}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7175460-steve", "userReview": "Not what they used to be.

From the first page on, I didn't want to put it down and, for the record, I read the whole thing in record time. While there's no shortage of action, though, this one - the 17th - focuses far less on the almost otherworldly side of FBI Special Agent A.X.L. (Aloysius) Pendergast. Maybe that's because his beloved ward, Constance Greene, isn't part of his life now; she's retreated to a monastery, apparently with no plans to return any time soon - and understandably, he's in a bit of a personal funk. But by the end of the book, he's picked up investigative steam - finding clues, digesting them and spitting out spot-on conclusions.The saga begins with the murder of the daughter of a ruthless, much-hated technology billionaire. It's a killing with a gruesome twist: There's a body, but no head. The case falls under the purview of Lt. Vincent D'Agosta, who's less than thrilled that it landed in his lap in large part because he knows the whole thing will turn into a media circus. So it is, then, that he's not unhappy when his rather eccentric friend Pendergast turns up at the crime scene. A shortage of clues leaves both men scratching their heads - Pendergast less so, of course - and the situation slides downhill fast. Not only does another victim turn up (well, most of him, anyway; he, too, is headless), but a nosy newspaper reporter got a whiff of a Pulitzer and starts sharpening his pencil - to the point of coining the phrase to describe New York City that became the title of the book. Still, law enforcement folks try hard to squelch the rumor that a deranged serial killer is on the loose, but those efforts take a nosedive as more heads roll (literally). Now, there's little doubt that the murders are the work of one person (perhaps with a cohort); and it's up to Pendergast and D'Agosta to discover the why and, of course, the who - the sooner the better.Meanwhile, the reporter's articles continue to rile up the general public (as well as spark a sub-plot scenario that, as an aside, to me seemed totally out of joint with the rest of the story). Near the end, the action takes a very serious turn toward the worst-case scenario, leading Pendergast on a not-so-merry chase that could result in no possibility of an 18th book.If there is one, though, it's a sure bet I'll be chomping at the bit to get my hands on it.

That\u2019s fine, but I missed Constance \u2013 immensely. Proctor plays a tiny role in this one. Really tiny. Basically driving on a beach. And while I like Pendergast and D\u2019Agosta, I didn\u2019t really feel that relationship this time. Vincent did his thing. Pendergast did his thing. And even when they were in the same room (or at the same crime scene) together, they kind of felt separate.During much of the book, we get to experience Pendergast\u2019s insights into the crime. It was fun to try put those insights into some sort of solution. Fun, but useless. You see at about 80% of the way through the book, you haven\u2019t figured it out. Pendergast hasn\u2019t figured it out. Vincent hasn\u2019t figured it out. And our Baddy? Our Baddy gets tired of waiting for them to figure it out and just straight out confesses!What?!?! Seriously.

What you might expect to be a sad, disappointing exploration of a hero who has lost his powers (so to speak), however, is instead a fascinating look at how that same hero emerges from his own darkness.For their 17th book in the series, Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child reunite Agent Pendergast with Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta, reuniting them in a case that harkens back to their earliest adventures, but which is also something new. The central mystery is entirely ordinary, devoid of even the hint of the supernatural, but a fitting commentary on the clash between poverty and the one-percenters, as well as the culture of 'fake news.' It's a fun mystery, involving locked rooms, James Bond type infiltrations, and decapitations, but the thrill here is less in the solution and more in the solving.Watching Agent Pendergast come alive is a real treat, with the slow reveal of the personality traits, behaviors, and dialogue we've come to appreciate over the years. He moves from disinterested, to frustrated, to curious, to fully engaged . . . from mortally human to the intellectual superhero who blew our minds in the first few books. It all culminates in a cat-and-mouse game inside the ruins of an abandoned asylum where the hunter and the hunted are interchangeable, presenting him with a worthy adversary - and one who doesn't have the advantage of being family.While it's a standalone thriller that does little to advance the overall mythology, City of Endless Night does feature a significant death. and has a gut-punch of an epilogue that demands we keep reading.Originally reviewed at Beauty in Ruins\nDisclaimer: I received a complimentary ARC of this title from the publisher in exchange for review consideration.

The spoiled daughter of a technology tycoon is killed, and her body is found in an abandoned warehouse ... without a head. NYPD Lt. Vincent D'Agosta catches the case. The case is sufficiently interesting to pique Agent Pendergast's fancy. When more headless bodies show up, it's clear that their foe is smart, organized, methodical, and pressure mounts to find the killer; however, the pair are stymied with the lack of evidence. Just as Pendergast figures out the identity of the killer, his FBI boss and D'Agosta are kidnapped, setting up a mano-a-mano showdown is an abandoned psychiatric ward in Suffolk County. Shame on DP/LC for calling it Sussex County. Also, the book was a little \"preachy\" about the excesses of the rich."}, {"userName": "Space Out With Sci Fi in June The Haunted Reading Room", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7302570-space-out-with-sci-fi-in-june-the-haunted-reading-room", "userReview": "Review: CITY OF ENDLESS NIGHT by Douglas Preston and Lincoln ChildI have devoured the Agent Pendergast novels since the very first. As a faithful reader, I confess to feeling since several novels back that I had gone off the rails. Perhaps it is my questioning if, after 17 installments, the co-authors can create anything new. Well, happily CITY OF ENDLESS NIGHT manages several unexpected twists, a seldom-used plot (although I have read it once in a classic short story), a heaping helping of character evolution (yes, including A. P.), and redeemingly, my most favorite setting. So Pendergast rocks on, although his intensifying humanity I personally find dismaying (although this is my personal viewpoint)."}, {"userName": "kartik narayanan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan", "userReview": "City of Endless Night is a throwback to the vintage Pendergast days.

I love these books, as corny as they are what with the evil super-villains and the gory murders and the Lord Peter Wimsey-ish protagonist and the loyal sidekicks. They're one of my guilty pleasures, and I don't even feel guilty about it. But geez, this was just the dumbest plot ever.It was written like a made-for-TV movie. Serial killer at loose, murdering the rich and famous. The authorities are clueless, so our man Pendergast is brought in, of course.

The start of this story snagged my interest mostly because I was wondering what the heck the kids had to do with anything related to the story. That was until they discovered a body in the oddest of places and the victim\u2019s head was nowhere to be found. Then I was very interested to know why the murderer took her head?! Vincent D\u2019Agosta was brought in to investigate and he was rather surprised to find Pendergast at the crime scene as well. As far as he knew this was the first murder to be done in a fashion and the FBI was usually only involved when they believed a murder or murders to be part of a serial murder case. Pendergast for his part was not enthused to be at the scene. He had apparently ruffled some feathers with his boss and he was \u201cbeing punished\u201d for his previous behaviors.D\u2019Agosta noticed that Pendergast did not seem to be himself but he was both glad and frustrated to have his insight into this case when it turned out that the body that was discovered was the daughter of a billionaire with a reputation for being ruthless. D\u2019Agosta knew that he was going to need the backing of the FBI in order to expedite matters that needed to be dealt with in a timely fashion among other things. He just wished that Pendergast would snap out of whatever was going on with him. When it appeared that the murderer or murderers decided to continue with the killings and beheadings, D\u2019Agosta was placed under extreme pressure to solve the case. With the public outcry regarding the unsolved murders, Pendergast\u2019s peculiar attitude shift, and all of his leads drying up, D\u2019Agosta wondered if this would be the end of his career.I did not want to put City of Endless Night down! I loved the combination of D\u2019Agosta being at his wit\u2019s end and Pendergast being peculiarly vulnerable. It was an entirely new side to consider for these characters and it made the story interesting. After so many books of the typical Pendergast, it was nice to see that in this story he was not his usual self and I loved that! The mystery was nicely done with a few red herrings thrown in to deflect from what was truly going on. Something that I wish had been different though was that I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of the inclusion of side characters having their own points of view. I know they had their place in the story but at the same time their POV\u2019s could have been taken from the book and it would have worked just fine without them. Although, I did enjoy the parts where the story was from the killer\u2019s point of view and as the story went on, that particular point of view became more intricate and detailed. Overall, City of Endless Night was an absolute page turning thriller and I highly recommend it.This review is based on a complimentary book I received from NetGalley.

The religious fanatic character was completely irrelevant to the story. The whole book seemed like a half-hearted attempt to churn out another book for the publisher, rather than a labor of love for their fans. That being said, even a half-hearted attempt by these authors is pretty good. Just not near as good as you come to expect from them, because they have set the bar so high in the past."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3119310-tiffany", "userReview": "While I would love to give this a more in-depth review, I'll be succinct in saying it was incredible to see Pendergast in this new light, and I await everyone's reactions to the ending.

It appears there may be two killers on the loose--one responsible for the young woman's death, another responsible for the mutilation. A pair of such dastardly killers requires a team of equally talented investigators. Luckily, both Vincent D'Agosta and Special Agent Pendergast are back in town.D'Agosta hopes that working a case back on his home turf for the first time in years will reinvigorate the FBI Special Agent and give him an opportunity to flex his investigative might. But neither is prepared to face a killer--or killers--as diabolical as this. It will take all of Pendergast and D'Agosta's intelligence and strength simply to match wits--let alone stay alive.DESCRIPTION NOT FINAL", "title": "City of Endless Night\n      \n          (Pendergast #17)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34517346-city-of-endless-night", "average": 4.11, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1494567440l/34517346.jpg", "reviews": 860, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12577.Douglas_Preston", "name": "Douglas Preston"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11091.Lincoln_Child", "name": "Lincoln Child"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Thriller", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Suspense"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34517346-city-of-endless-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34523585-city-of-endless-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67035.Relic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39031.The_Cabinet_of_Curiosities", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39030.Reliquary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136637.Brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30068.The_Book_of_the_Dead"]}
