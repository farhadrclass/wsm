While I follow the game regularly and have passed the love onto my kids, I also enjoy studying the history of the game. Last year I found the Mickey Rawlings Baseball Mystery series by Troy Soos. Set in the 1910s, the novels focus on a utility player named Mickey Rawlings as he moves from team to team in his attempt to hang on in the major leagues. Murder at Fenway Park is the first book in the series and Soos first novel as he takes readers back in time to the early days of America's pastime. It is 1912. Mickey Rawlings, age nineteen, has just been called up to the Red Sox to play in brand new Fenway Park. The first modern ball park, the Red Sox with the backing of Boston mayor Honey Fitzgerald and the Royal Rooters and hoping for a World Series victory. Assembling a stellar team featuring ace pitcher Smokey Joe Wood and batting star Tris Speaker, the Red Sox have the talent to win it all. Yet, as soon as Rawlings arrives in Boston, he discovers a dead body in one of Fenway's corridors, a plot that could possibly derail the Red Sox's special season. Rawlings soon finds out that the body is none other than Detroit Tigers third baseman Red Corriden, a young man just a little older than himself. Even though he only stumbled upon the body, Rawlings desires to identify Corriden's murderer and bring him to justice. With the help of his friend New York Times reporter Karl Landfors, Rawlings slowly pieces together a gambling ring lead by bookie Arnold Rothstein, which employs ball players to fix games. Rothstein, who was later involved with the 1919 Black Sox scandal, had placed a fix on the American League batting race in addition to the standings, and his well placed players attempted to derail the great Ty Cobb from winning. Corriden was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and, unfortunately, had to be eliminated. If Rawlings refuses to stay out of the way, he could be next. Soos series focuses on baseball during the 1910s. I have already read the novels about the Cubs and Yankees, and the books are historically accurate. This story predates the Red Sox curse when the Yankees were still the Highlanders, and the Red Sox battled the Cobb lead Tigers for the American League pennant on a yearly basis. In days before players unions, league president Ban Johnson held all of the power and could throw people out of the game on a whim. While the stories focus on Rawlings and perhaps a current love interest, I enjoy hearing about Hall of Famers such as Cobb, Nap Lajoie, Smokey Joe Wood, and Walter Johnson. Soos depiction of Cobb as a violent person is especially accurate, and having a murder cases focused around one of his batting titles was an interesting premise for a novel. Murder at Fenway Park is Soos' debut novel. For a debut, I thought the writing was above average and paced well for a murder mystery. Rawlings character is not as fleshed out as later in the series, but he is introspective for a ball player and an inquisitive wide eyed kid in this debut. Soos baseball mysteries are a perfect read for during the baseball season as they are fun, fast paced historical whodunits. I eventually would like to read the entire series and rate this debut effort 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara", "userReview": "The book is Soos' first in a series set in the past, revolving around baseball stadiums. The protagonist is Mickey Rawlings, who is a rookie with the Red Sox, playing at the brand new Fenway Park. His first day, Mick arrives late after a train delay, and stumbles over a dead body. Afraid he is being looked at for the murder, Mick decides to investigate. Although he is a decent ball player, he is a pretty bad detective. Luckily his would-be girlfriend, Peggy and a friend of hers who's a newspaper journalist, are much better investigators.I learned a good amount of baseball history from this novel. The famous 1912 pitching battle between Joe Wood and Walter Johnson was included in the novel, as was, no surprise, the 1912 World Series which Boston won, defeating the NY Giants. I didn't know Fenway had a hill, later known as Duffy's Cliff, which forced left fielder's to play running uphill. Ty Cobb is a bad guy in the story, no surprise. Soos' description of Boston geography, though not extensive, is accurate. Trolleys were the way to get to Jamaica Plain, and Arnold Arboretum. This was Soos's debut baseball mystery and a decent novel. I'd read more though this was going to be my favorite being a Red Sox fan, and considering Boston, my hometown. And I am watching the Sox playing in Fenway on tv while writing this."}, {"userName": "Ronna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6936236-ronna", "userReview": "As a baseball lover and mystery lover, I found this book to be a fun beginning to a baseball mystery series. In 1912, a young baseball player, Mickey Rawlings, has just gotten his call to play in the big leagues with the Boston Red Socks. He's come into the brand new Fenway Park to check in and immediately finds the body of one of his team mates. Red Corriden's head is bash up badly, but the police and team owner just seem to want everything hushed up. Would've want any bad publicity for the new stadium. But there's much more to it than that, and Mickey finds he has to discover the murderer before someone kills him too.I found this book to be a real winner. The mystery was interesting, and was filled with numerous fun facts about real historical players and team owners of that time period. It was also interesting living the life of a ball player of that time. Surely different from today's players. Lots of big names came into play, Ty Cobb and Cy Young amongst them. Troy Soos managed to be factual about the real people and maintain a fictional story as well. Great reading for mystery lovers during baseball season!!"}, {"userName": "Gail Chall", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6856023-gail-chall", "userReview": "So boring! Couldn't maintain my interest nor did I have a desire to read and/or finish this book--I did because I was reading it for a book club. I usually like books that are cozies and that don't have serial killers or include a lot of suspense. But this one was awful, with so many typographical and grammatical errors, that the reader even had a hard time following the name of a main character. Maybe the paperback version was clean, but the Kindle edition had constant replacements of the letter \"l\" with the letter \"t.\" Maybe a fanatical baseball history buff would enjoy this story, but I sure didn't."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen", "userReview": "1912, Boston. The Titanic is only a few weeks lost to the North Atlantic bottom, but Mickey Rawling's mind isn't on one of the biggest maritime disasters of history. No, he's just been inducted into the Major Leagues, hired to play with the Boston Red Sox, and his first night he's stumbled upon a man beaten so badly the victim's face no longer exists. And then Mickey threw up on it, just for good measure. Murder at Fenway Park is the story of a rookie ball player who turns amateur detective when he realizes the police intend on fingering him for the crime. While the cozy relationship between the Red Sox and the police might protect him during the baseball season, come fall he'll be left to his own devices. The first in Trey Soos' baseball-murder mysteries, Murder at Fenway takes readers through a violence summer, in which Rawlings rubs shoulders with baseball greats like Ty Cobb, and does his best -- with the aide of a nickelodeon musician and a Socialist working on the garment factory-version of The Jungle -- to figure out who did it before either being arrested or beaten to a pulp by the original murderer. The writing is sometimes unpolished, but the opening framing device -- an old man wandering through the Baseball Hall of Fame, feeling he and the sport have become long-distant strangers, then flashing back to the murder story on seeing the victim on a baseball card -- was well executed. I suspect readers will find the setting more interesting than the mystery, considering how dramatic this era was in baseball. This was the decade that produce legends who gave their names to awards -- Cy Young, Ty Cobb -- although we're two years away from Babe Ruth stepping up to the plate. This is technically alt-fiction, considering that Soos kills off a player who -- in reality, died of a heart attack in 1959.Murder at Fenway Park is by no means amazing literature, but it's enjoyable if you like early-20th century mysteries, or golden age baseball."}, {"userName": "Charly", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/584414-charly", "userReview": "As a mystery it wasn't overwhelming, but when you add in the baseball history it goes up a star. entertaining and relatively fast moving piece.

A rookie ballplayer who has recently been acquired by the Red Sox arrives at brand new Fenway Park just in time to find the body of a Tigers' third baseman. The police arrive shortly thereafter just in time to find the rookie ballplayer, who is now also a murder suspect.This book had a great hook, and I enjoyed the supporting cast of Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Shoeless Joe Jackson, and other early legends of the game that weren't really characters in the story but their presence lent authenticity to a compelling story set in the early part of the 20th century. A murder mystery in that era, with limited means of communication, was fun to read and experience. However, I prefer a mystery that allows the reader to do the thinking. The story had a nice build up, but really jumped around quite a bit toward the end and introduced a lot of red herrings that I had not even considered and detracted from what could have been a great read. Baseball fans will enjoy this much more than mystery enthusiasts, and that's not saying much."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68957754-john", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book, my first by this author. It is the first in a series and it covers fictional incidents from the 1912 Boston Red Sox season. Being a longtime baseball fan, I was impressed with the research that comes out clearly in this book. I am familiar with many of the names noted in this book and the writer brought them to life in a dynamic way. His methods brought you back to a time when major league baseball was really in its infancy. He also touched on how corrupt our society was in those days and how easy it was for someone to get away with a heinous crime.

Mickey is a rookie major leaguer, second stringer utility player who, upon reporting to Fenway Park, comes across a man's body that has been beaten with a baseball bat. Initially suspected, later he finds out that the body was moved to another location so as not to generate negative publicity. Who was the man? When another death happens--this one an elderly assistant that Mickey had questioned about the first killing who was shot in an alley, it seems that someone is trying to set Mickey up. He works with a lady friend of his who introduces him to the principles of detecting and sets out trying to discover who had the motive, means and opportunity to do in both men. Was it the powerful owner of the Red Sox, or one of the players trying to cover up a problem? Or someone else from the shady gambling world?I had listened to one of the later books in the series last week, and it was definitely better than this one. I think if I had listened to this one first, I may not have continued. It just felt very circular, with the main character going around and around and around and over the same evidence and same suppositions over and over again. And there were a LOT of different characters to try to keep straight--which isn't always easy when listening to an audio book. I spotted the bad guy right away but I didn't know why or how he'd done it. Perhaps it was just listening to this so soon after the later, much better, book that caused it to suffer in comparison.

This book takes place in the fabulous Golden Age of 1910! The main character Mickey Rawlings who is now playing for the Red Sox, mysteriously finds a dead corpse lying on the ground at the Fenway baseball park. With the police thinking that he might be the guilty party, Rawlings must find clues so they won't track his ''innocence''. If he does not fulfill this task, he shall be executed!  I really like that there was a lot of drama, and it was detailed. Mickey is doing things he shouldn't be doing, sometimes for his own safety. When Mickey's own problems and different types of situations come up, he discusses them with his very close friends. One thing I disliked and didn't really understand was when the author specified baseball and what players were doing during the game. In those parts I didn't know exactly know what I was reading because I don't understand how to play baseball itslef. There weren't a lot of parts I didn't like. I truly and honestly loved this book.  I recommend this great book to anyone who likes mystery books such as Nancy Drew plus has a liking for baseball and especially the Red Sox!!! Another reason someone might want to read this book is that it takes place about one-hundred years ago in 1910. I think that Troy Soos is already an amazing author with writing this book and I can't wait to read more of his books in this series!"}, {"userName": "Julie H.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1492430-julie-h", "userReview": "Murder at Fenway Park is a murder mystery set against the backdrop of newly-constructed Fenway Park in 1912 Boston. Fresh out of the minor leagues, Mickey Rawlings arrives in Boston and discovers a corpse--that promptly goes missing--at the ball park. Unsure who to trust, as there are shenanigans aplenty and the Red Sox (formerly the Boston Americans--up until 1908) management is keen to avoid any negative press associated with the new venue, Mickey receives a series of warnings when he begins investigating how his DB ended up in Dorchester. And then there's a second corpse. And the cops (Irish and straight from central casting) are crooked and may frame our narrator, Mr. Rawlings.The mystery itself is pretty ho-hum stuff, however the descriptions of Fenway and environs will warm the heart of any baseball fan or Bostonian. Likewise, historians of sport may well enjoy the nifty bits of sports and equipment trivia. Hard core mystery readers, however, will likely find it a bit of a slow go. This book is the first in a series for those who wish to follow Rawlings as he makes his way around the American League. While I won't be making that trip with him, I'm glad to have dropped in for a look around."}, {"userName": "Msjodi777", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903985-msjodi777", "userReview": "Wasn't really sure when I got this book whether I would like it or not. I hate watching baseball on tv, but really enjoyed going to the park for the games, whether they were the minor league GSO Hornets (way back before they became the GSO Bats, because the Charlotte basketball team was the hornets) or the company soft ball team. Going to the park to watch was fun. Then to find out that Johnny Heller was the narrator and he will be in the audiobook narrator's corner, well just had to listen to it. Actually turned out to be quite a good book. It's mostly about the murder and figuring out whodunit, but Mr. Soos really captured the essence of going to the park to watch a good baseball game. He brings in the sport of baseball - which I didn't figure I would like, but it was done so well, that I did like it, and I learned quite a bit on top of that. So, yes, I'm giving it 5 stars, partly because of the story, partly because of the narration which was excellent, and yes, even if you only know a little about baseball, I would recommend it.
