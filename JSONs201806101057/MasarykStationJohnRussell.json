Even though he was linked to the Com\u00admu\u00adnist Party he is involved in spy\u00ading for the Amer\u00adi\u00adcans and the Rus\u00adsians try\u00ading to keep his fam\u00adily secure and safe. John is mar\u00adried to a Ger\u00adman actress named Effie, they have a son and an adopted daughter.John is plan\u00adning one final job which will cement the finan\u00adcial secu\u00adrity and well being of his fam\u00adily before he retires. How\u00adever that final reward will take guts, cun\u00adning and an enor\u00admous risk which he might not be will\u00ading to take.Masaryk Sta\u00adtion by David Down\u00ading ties up the John Rus\u00adsell series nicely, will giv\u00ading the reader much to think about even thought the story takes place 7 decades ago. In this book Mr. Rus\u00adsell strug\u00adgles to the do the right thing but doesn\u2019t really know what the right thing is, or even what is the right course of action he should take.Mr. Down\u00ading does an excel\u00adlent job writ\u00ading char\u00adac\u00adters. All of the char\u00adac\u00adters in the book, bad or good, felt as if they could have been real peo\u00adple. How\u00adever, the plot is still dark and bru\u00adtal against the back\u00addrop of Prague and Berlin.The inter\u00adest\u00ading part of the book was the cur\u00adrency reform of Berlin, when both Amer\u00adi\u00adcan and Russ\u00adian inter\u00adests wanted to con\u00adtrol the cur\u00adrency and hence the econ\u00adomy. Both coun\u00adtries try to reassert their power and legit\u00adi\u00admacy over Berlin, nei\u00adther will\u00ading (nor polit\u00adi\u00adcally able) to back out. The author also rec\u00adog\u00adnizes the famed Berlin Block\u00adade in which Rus\u00adsia blocked all pas\u00adsages by air, road, rail and water between the East and West zones. The block\u00adade was designed to force the USA, Eng\u00adland and France to leaver Berlin or at least accept Russ\u00adian cur\u00adrency in their areas.It didn\u2019t work!This is the final book to an excel\u00adlent series in which the author appraises post World War II Europe in a cyn\u00adi\u00adcal, tired, yet clear man\u00adner.

In \"Masaryk Station\" the world of 1948 feels perhaps a little less grubby but more uncertain because of the political game the Soviets are playing. It was interesting reading about a Berlin where the divisions of the times to come did not exist and which were unimaginable. People seem to move around between zones with perfect freedom but also with an understanding of the undertones that exist in Soviet behaviour. Abroad (because that's where a lot of the action in the first half of the book takes place) it is the Americans who are playing a duplicitous game just as they did in \"Lehrter Station\". They have allied themselves with former Nazi supporters in what they know will be the coming conflict with the Soviets. They play a quiet role in supporting the number of escape routs that have been set up for Ukrainian Nazi-supporting nationalists, bloodthirsty Croat racists and for Soviet defectors. Our hero, John Russell is in the middle of both these worlds and thus has no illusions about either party. His hands feel filthy and he would love to get out.Then along comes an opportunity. Something has turned up that might just provide Russell and his family with a get-out-of-jail-free ticket... On the whole this was a good read marred only by the terrible grammatical errors that appear to have been thrown into the publication like spanners intended to ruin my day. They are irritating and evidence of a rush into publication (either that or the Soviets have been at it... or those incompetent US officers that crop up in the book). Without wishing to spoil the read for anyone else, I do think the outcome is a little simplistic and even \"innocent\" for a book that has its feet in the realpolitik of those uncertain times. Another ending would have been much more realistic... Oh cynic that I am!"}, {"userName": "Speesh", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4052463-speesh", "userReview": "A superb end to a simply wonderful series. A marvellous end to the book. Happiness tinged with sadness. Tragedy and hope. It didn\u2019t really feel like a \u2018goodbye.\u2019 An au revoir, hopefully. Though that\u2019s probably me wishing it, rather than it actually being so. And yes, he saved the best for (the) last (two).As the book begins, it is three years since the second war to end all wars ended. But the world feels for many just as unsafe as it was. Perhaps more so. The series\u2019 \u2018hero\u2019 John Russell and his old espionage \u2018friend' and part-time Soviet controller, Shchepkin find themselves sinking deeper and deeper into the new world of spies and mistrust, as the two new world powers let paranoia about each other override any thoughts of justice and retribution for the people who suffered most. The ordinary man and woman in the street, wherever that street might once have been in Europe, are just as expendable in the new Cold War as they ever were in the 'old' war. Russell and Shchepkin reach the conclusion that there is probably no escape for them, or those they care for, not alive anyway. Unless, that is, they can find a secret about one side or the other, to use as blackmail. They know plenty of secrets, of course, but the people they know secrets about, also know secrets about them. It needs to be a big one, a huge one, a secret so potentially devastating, that it would be worth leaving them alone to pay for. If they survive long enough after disclosing it, to use it, that is.I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a deep message to be got from the \u2019Station\u2019 series. David Downing hasn\u2019t been on a cliched anti-war, anti-Nazi, anti-conflict, mission. That\u2019s for us to read in maybe. The things I take from the series are maybe the triumph of spirit and that people, no matter where they come from, are fundamentally decent at heart. That war affects every side differently, but in the end the same. There are no winners, the human race loses. Masaryk Station, in summing up the series that has gone before it, is about betrayal. Of people, each other, of ideas. It\u2019s about starting to build your own future, because no one else is going to do it for you. Certainly not the Big Powers, as here. They say they are, but they can\u2019t be trusted with the future and certainly not with yours\u2019. Universally relevant wherever you find yourself today, it\u2019s about all sides being let down by their leaders, elected and unelected.Despite (obviously) being written by an English (speaking) writer, the series has been remarkably even-handed and non-judgemental. You draw your own conclusions, if you want to. Obviously, the events and atrocities will speak for themselves, however, they can be open to interpretation, however you want to interpret them, depending on which side you were or are. There were no winners, nothing was solved by 5 years of war and 40-odd million dead.It\u2019s impossible to pick a best book of the six Stations and would be wrong to even think about trying. Could the series be returned to? Yes. Should it? That\u2019s a whole other question.'Masaryk Station' especially and the series as a whole leave me with sadness, hope, tragedy, happiness, possibility. Leaves me with a smile on my face and hope in my heart and glad that I travelled with David Downing, John Russell and Effi Cohen.More world-class reviews on Speesh Reads"}, {"userName": "Evelyn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1660357-evelyn", "userReview": "This is number 5 in Downing's 'John Russell and Effi Koenen series'and for fans of the first 4 it won't disappoint. The series tracks the adventures of a British American journalist and expat living in Berlin and his German actress girlfriend from their pre-war days in Nazi Germany through the war years and finally to this book which takes place in 1948 and which is billed as the final installment of the series (though to be honest, I'm not convinced Downing doesn't still have another one up his sleeve). The premise of this book, as well as the other 4, is engaging. Initially stuck in Germany because his ex-wife and son are there, as well as his current girlfriend, Russell ends up being recruited by the Americans and the Russians to spy for their respective countries using his journalist credentials as a cover. Each thinks he's a double agent on their side, and during the war the Germans recruit him as well, assuming he'll do their bidding above the others. How Russell manages to juggle all his masters yet stay (relatively) true to his moral center keeps the reader interested.Along with the well paced plots and engaging lead characters, Downing's background descriptions of life in Berlin (as well as a few other European cities) before, during and after the war are a major portion of the hold these books have on the reader. The details and descriptions are skillfully written and help bring the story to life, as well as cause the book's atmospherics to linger in the reader's memory even after the story is done.This time Russell and Koenen are trying to survive in the American sector of the divided city while being unwillingly drawn into Russian intrigues. Russell realizes the only way to put his clandestine past behind him and be truly free is to find some information so dangerous to the Russians' cause that they'll leave him alone for fear of its revelation. How Russell manages this, and makes it work is a fine way to wrap up the series, although this reader would still like some more..."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark", "userReview": "I am so sorry to see this series end, but in the process, I have been impressed with David Downing's ability to create a continuing cast of characters who survived the Nazis and the Soviets (not to mention the Americans) as Berlin moved through WWII and emerged into the beginning of the Cold War.I wasn't certain this would be the last until the end notes, but it apparently is. In this final chapter, John Russell, the British-American journalist and double agent, his actress wife Effi and their adopted daughter Rosa are trying to survive the intrigue and tug of war between the Soviets, the Germans who are now occupied by the Allies, and the Americans. In the process of all this, with at least two other murderous subplots thrown in for good measure, Russell and his longtime Soviet mentor Shchepkin discover the existence of a film that endangers the reputation of one of Russia's most feared leaders -- and could give them their chance to finally quit the spy business and move to America. The film does its work, but not before some very tense moments at the end, which thankfully spare all the people we have come to care about. One final note. I don't know if this was the fault of the original British manuscript or its American version, but Masaryk Station was full of typos -- dropped words, incorrect verb tenses and other glitches that gave it an amateurish feel despite Downing's excellent sense of storytelling and pace. Silly question, I know, but are there no proofreaders anymore?If you ever want to have a close-up view of what life was like in Berlin leading up to WWII and afterwards, you should start with Zoo Station, and move through all the other \"station\" books to get to this one."}, {"userName": "Randee Baty", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4474156-randee-baty", "userReview": "Berlin, Prague and Belgrade are not a lot of fun to live in after WWII! John Russell, double agent working for the Soviets and the Americans, spends most of his time trying to figure out how to accomplish his missions for both of them and extricate himself from working for either of them. He just wants to keep his wife and his daughter safe.I have not read the earlier books in this series and I do think that would have helped with understanding the relationships between the characters but I thoroughly enjoyed this thriller anyway. Having spent a little time in Eastern Europe, this felt very realistic. If you're a student of WWII or the Cold War, this book is an interesting novel about the time as those two are intersecting. The settings feel real, the characters' dilemmas and emotions feel real, the secret agencies on both sides feel real.

This book was very good from the history standpoint again which is what drew me to this series in the first place. But that being said this should be the end I would think. Also I must say that my impressions of neutrality politically was different this time and it was starting to bother me. I feel that Downing was trying to hard sell me on the vertues of pure Socializem in the Lenin style. I'm not sold that it was such a great system.

He was linked to the Communist party in his early years. He was briefly married to a German citizen and they had a son named Paul. John Russell, and his long-time companion is a German actress named Effi. They adopted a young girl orphaned by the war, her name is Rosa. Through out the Station series John Russell, has been involved in espionage, he's struggled with each opposing side, he's struggled with his own feelings and conscience. In Masaryk Station, the year is 1948. Europe is beginning to rebuild, although destruction from the war is still evident. The Soviet Union is a threatening menace in Berlin, and in eastern Europe. America wants information on what the Soviet Union plans to do. The Soviet Union wants information on what America has knowledge of, how ready they are for another war, what their reaction would be to any given hostile action, and what they plan to do with Berlin. John Russell is working both sides. His belief all along, and throughout the Station series has been for the safety and security of his family.One final job may secure a way out for all of them. The mission is prickly with danger, but the payout will be freedom. Wow! What a fantastic ending book for this series!Why did I give this book 5 stars? In a series, the books should tie together well. Masaryk Station refers to previous books, especially to the beginning book when John Russell begins working in espionage. When the last book is read, I was able to have an aha moment, understanding the complete circle of development over the course of the other five books. John Russell and his companion Effi are characters that grow and develop over the course of the books. I can look back and see a transformation.  John and Effi are likable and relatable characters. Even though I did not agree with everything they did or said, I liked them. They are dimensional, real.  I learned the espionage world is not a place where guns are \"a-blazing\" like in a western movie. It is a game of cat and mouse, of observe and wait. When reaction is necessary, knowledge and wisdom of the other side is a key point. Masaryk Station, begins with a story that is a dramatic model for man's inhumanity to another. It is a story of the dark brutality that resides in men who are given full power to achieve their heinous evil. This beginning story is a picture image of those vile destructive men who were Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, including all those who fell in-line with their thinking and action. A lot of the story has the back-drop of Prague, Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic.) I was there in 2001 and on this blog post I've posted a few of my photos. Prague is one of my favorite cities! By the sixth book, Masaryk Station, I wanted John Russell to do the right thing. But, then I thought what would be the right course of action for him? This question was just one of the reasons I kept reading the book.....devouring each page. I want to mention, because I have reader's that want to know these things, that there are curse words and course language----not on every page, but sprinkled throughout.

(But I think the first, Zoo Station, is the best of the lot.) It does take a hundred pages before anything suspenseful, thrilling or dramatic occurs but the last two hundred plus pages do not disappoint, ending in a crescendo of lethal conflict resolution. Events unfold in the post-war European hangover of WW2. The Soviet Union has laid claim to all of Eastern Europe, creating puppet \u2018socialist republics.\u2019 But the communist nationalists in many of these countries are reluctant to follow Stalin\u2019s marching orders. Germany, its capital Berlin, and Austria have been split into four zones administered by Great Britain, France, the U.S. of A. and Soviet Russia. Berlin is an island in the middle of the Soviet controlled East Germany. The iconic Yugoslav President Tito had been instrumental in forming a socialist federation of six republics and managed to keep his distance from Moscow dominance.The setting is 1948. Readers are faced with getting acquainted with a stew of opposing forces and loyalties with ties to diverse ideologies and criminal elements. John Russell, journalist and double-agent (to America and to the Soviets) is the go-to sleuth who adeptly adapts his plans of action to comply with his own ethics and whatever is expedient in each situation. This time his travels bring him away from his Berlin base to Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Italia and Austria. Frequently he gets entangled in the morass of constantly changing power plays between security forces, saboteurs and political tyrants. Effi, his wife, who is an admired actress in her native Germany, and Rosa, their loving but vulnerable eleven year old adopted daughter, provide him with the love and motivation to survive and get the job done. At the end readers can only wonder what happens to the Russells once John has severed ties to both the NKVD and the CIA. The transition to civilian life would not have been an easy one. Smoldering resentments and revenge by some agencies and operatives would have been threatening shadows difficult to shake off. Methinks there could have been another book \u2026"}, {"userName": "James Kemp", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6824106-james-kemp", "userReview": "A very satisfying end to the series, although still leaving me with a wish for a more detailed epilogue that told us more about the rest of the cast's lives. As with the others there is a lot of history being told here, Downing does his research and then puts it on the page. Although one obvious lack was the bit about copying a film where the story goes straight from copying to playback without going through the development process. This is in an era where chemical processing was needed to view pictures on film after they'd been shot. Given the rest of the research I'd have thought that was known to Downing. I did enjoy this though, and there were a number of different angles. My favourite was Strohm, who we met in Stettin Station as the railway worker that was tipping off Russell when the Jewish transports were leaving so that he could witness them. By this story he's a senior member of the East German communist party (although not quite East Germany yet). He's on the inside track of what the Soviets are planning and he's also losing his faith in the Soviet control of the German Communist Party. Everything he's asked to do goes against his inner principles and belief in socialism. This was a common part of the KPD survivors and most of those where finally repressed after the June 1953 uprising. This is the last of the series, Russell has got his out from the blackmail that made him work for the Soviets. Although I wouldn't be too surprised to find that there is a later book. Russell's leverage with the soviets will eventually expire, and he'll also have trouble working in the USA when the McCarthyites get going."}, {"userName": "Corny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/776307-corny", "userReview": "This is the concluding volume of the John Russell series which takes place over the decade which begins with prewar Berlin and ends with Partition of Berlin in 1949. The last volume is particularly evocative of the times of four power occupation of the city. Downing writes with historical accuracy and weaves an interesting plot for Russell and his companion Effi. Read this series from the beginning to avoid spoilers which do crop up even as early as the second book. I gave this volume the highest marks because you can see how the characters have evolved from their innocent prewar state into what they have become today, hardened survivors. In some ways this series reminds me of Alan Furst except that Furst never continues his novels. They are all discrete stories. Downing instead has chosen to write a serial account of a turbulent period and he has pulled it off with only minor mishaps. In the sixth book he has abandoned some of the excess geographical references of previous volumes and created a well-plotted and absorbing thriller. You never quite know when disaster will strike which makes this novel so suspenseful. I chose to read these six books all at once so I wouldn't lose the thread but it is really not necessary as long as you read them in order.

The books begin before the war, run through it, and end in the first years after the war. The concluding book sets the stage for the Berlin Wall and the circling of the entire country. The actually Mauer to be built after the end of this novel.Overall I enjoyed the series with it's focus on the people of Berlin and it's seemingly open structure of composition. The fifth book is also good, but the author's maneuvering to set up a cut off point in the final book - this one - is a bit obvious. Masaryk Station - this the last in the series - feels more forced, forced to bring the whole half-dozen to an end. It also ties up a lot of loose ends and some in too obvious a directed manner, for me anyway. There are therefore one or two \"coincidences\" that I found unlikely and contrived. Read them all in order and you see what I mean, while I won't give them away the film coincidence was really too coincidental and the doubt factor caused me to mutter as I read.A very good series on Berlin in WWII, but the publisher seems to be having difficulty of late catching word emissions or redundancies.

The series compares favorably to both Alan Furst's novels and the Bernie Gunther series, with this volume being more firmly in the espionage genre than any of the previous ones.This volume was a bit more confusing because of the variety of initials and acronyms of organizations that rose to prominence in post-war Germany (although the author does provide an explanatory page). But the last third of the book moves towards a satisfying climax. As with past books, a series of maps would have been helpful as the author does a good job of laying out the geography of central Europe, especially Berlin. A very small annoyance with this book is the somewhat careless copy editing that went into it. It's not throughout, but there are enough subject-verb agreement errors and dropped words to bother me.

Must admit after the prior read I preferred the premise of the stories set in pre-war/WWII era as opposed to the beginnings of the cold war which the series has run on into so in a way I was glad to see this is the last in the series. However that said, this chapter is a lot better than book 5 as we get a good mix of cold-war (Western Allies vs Russia) & post-war (Germans & Axis allies on the run) politics spread over the whole region which encompasses East Berlin, Czechoslovakia, Trieste & Belgrade as the principal locales. It becomes quite a tangled web as the power vacuum left by the Nazis/Western empires (British & French) is filled by the Americans & Russians in central/Eastern Europe. You also have various factions in East Germany vying for power along with the conflicts in Yugoslavia & Czechoslovakia which sees socialist & capitalists trying to take control as well as fend off/remove the Russians after being liberated by them. That\u2019s jus an overview of what\u2019s on offer.I\u2019m not sure if the book gives full justice to the complex machinations of this era mentioned above, in fact it could probably spawn an entire new series. But the author of the series has chosen this period to run into & gives an ok-to-good flavour of the times & in the end is one I would have liked to maybe explore a little more. Does the series run out of Steam? Maybe just a little but I think due to the ages of the main characters it\u2019s a timely withdrawal..... are you sensing mixed emotions..... you\u2019d be right as the era is only really touched upon & it\u2019s the series MC\u2019s ongoing attempted disentanglement from the world of espionage that is the real story in this book, the history being jus a backdrop in reality.As to the ending, well...... thats for you to discover, it had been building for a while.One thing i\u2019ll add about this series is that its really leapt out at me, that so many fairly high ranking Nazis just managed to slip away or be absorbed back into society without much recompense at all. Scientists & engineers I knew about, them being given a get out of Gaol Free pass by the American & Russian research programs.I think it\u2019s a 3.5 stars rounded upto 4 & for the entire series I\u2019d give a good 4 stars rating."}, {"userName": "LaNae", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2803526-lanae", "userReview": "I finally got time to finish the last book in this series. I would say 3.5 to 4*, but I didn't find it as strong as a whole as the others (even though it has been a while since I read them). Having spent time in cold-war Era Berlin and some of the other settings of the book it was interesting to me, particularly the tensions that would eventually lead to the Berlin airlift and eventually the wall. The author didn't steer clear of some questionable practices on both the Russian and American side, in terms of practices, strategies or methods of dealing with people, especially those in some cases who could be labeled war criminals, but that might have useful information or skills that would serve a purpose on one side or another. The main character finds himself having to make questionable choices to not only survive, but to extricate himself from both the Soviet and US spy machinery. I do have friends whose parents saw the writing on the wall and were able to exit East Germany before things became nearly impossible to do so. The author did a good job of conveying the unease, and potential threats that were part of post-war Berlin existence.My biggest complaint about this book is that after the climax, the book ended rather abruptly and left me feeling as if I'd been left hanging a bit, even though I guess the assumption is that all was well. Given the details that probably still needed to be worked out in order for that to be credible, it felt rushed at the very end and left me with a lot of uncertainty for some of the main characters. Perhaps that was intentional, but if this is indeed ends up as the last book in this series I didn't get a complete sense of resolution. Furthermore, given the circumstances in which the main character finds himself, in many ways the ending seems a bit unlikely. I also felt like there were other ideas that were explored, specifically the dissatisfaction or disillusionment of the German or Yugoslav communists with the way that the Soviets operated that left the fate of some of the characters in limbo. It would make a lot more sense if I knew that another installment was in the offing."}, {"userName": "Phil", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66280703-phil", "userReview": "I could not but help this sixth book in the Station series was a bit rushed.

After five previous \u201cJohn Russell\u201d thrillers with railway terminals in the titles, the series is coming to an end. It\u2019s 1948, and Russell--sophisticated freelance journalist, former Communist and reluctant double-agent--is back in Berlin with his second family, trying to make a decent life after the destruction of the Third Reich and the city he loves. The four Allied powers are struggling for advantage in a divided Berlin, sometimes leaving corpses on the scene. Carrying on with the author\u2019s cinema metaphors, the post-war European geopolitical scene is one \u201cin which Berliners, high and low, could only function as extras\u201d (p65). John Russell, after more than 10 years of spying and lying and risking death just to keep his family safe, is looking for a way out and back to an ordinary life. He and his demoralized \u201ccontrol,\u201d the Russian intelligence officer Shchepkin, are working to ferret out \u201ca secret so damaging that we could buy our safety with silence\u201d (p211). MASARYK STATION demonstrates how hard it is for veteran spies to quit while they\u2019re still breathing.Throughout this gritty, well-researched series, John Russell has operated on the principal that \u201cThere\u2019s not much difference between journalism and espionage\u201d (p19). Cynical without being immoral, heroic without being a hero, John Russell is a highly sympathetic character who always acts as a reasonable person would do. \u201cThe First War had confirmed Russell\u2019s belief that the status quo was a kind of freewheeling murderous cock-up that only served the rich\u201d (p179)--but his idealism about socialism is long gone. A secondary character in the book, Gerhard Str\u00f6hm, a party official and railroad manager, still dreams that Germany might build its own bright Marxist future, if only Stalin's boot would leave his country\u2019s neck. The friendship and loyalty between Str\u00f6hm and Russell, although they\u2019re working for different futures, is an important element in the story. And the film career of Russell\u2019s brave German-Jewish wife, the resourceful Effi, is a welcome relief from the militaristic clanking and plotting of the new, pinheaded intelligence \u201cprofessionals\u201d who are eager to monopolize Russell\u2019s services. A fitting conclusion to a remarkable espionage series."}, {"userName": "Czol", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3181575-czol", "userReview": "I've enjoyed all the other books in this series, & I expected to enjoy this one as well. Post-war Berlin is a fascinating setting, with complex power struggles & a tense situation developing as the Cold War unfolds. I expected to be gripped by a new instalment in the lives of the characters & the city of Berlin itself.But nothing is happening! What's more, what passes for a plot is sluggish with no urgency. John is out of Berlin doing... something? I dunno. He does some interpreting work that doesn't seem to matter at all (either plot-wise or in terms of wider implications for the time & setting). He's working on a story about some guy smuggling people somewhere & apparently they're bad people but I can't bring myself to care because they're all just names that blur into each other & I forget the moment I've read them, & he doesn't seem to have any drive to find answers. Then he goes to some other city & talks to some other people about how they feel about the Russians. Why? I have no idea, & there's no reason given to care about these people's answers as there was when he had to interview German communists in the previous book.This is interspersed with glimpses of Effi's life back in Berlin. Which mainly consist of her angsting over her adopted daughter & musing over her film work, with little insight into living in Berlin. There's a vague suggestion of a subplot about an apparent suicide but nobody seems to care (it doesn't help that we were shown what actually happened in the prologue, which, while horrible, isn't anything that hasn't happened to most of the women in Berlin by this point, so I'm left wondering if solving the mystery of the woman's death will achieve anything).Str\u00f6hm is added as a POV character here, & his story seems the most interesting, concentrating on shifting political loyalties, but we only get the occasional few paragraphs & again there's no real drive to it.34% of the way through & I'm giving in because it's just a slog getting through it. It seems that this is the last book in the series, so I suppose at least I will not have to worry about skipping anything that might be relevant later."}, {"userName": "Rob Kitchin", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin", "userReview": "Masaryk Station is the sixth and final book in the John Russell and Effi Koenen \u2018station\u2019 series, which charts the couple\u2019s lives from 1939 to 1948, most of it spent in Berlin. Russell, a former communist, worked as an American journalist, before becoming a full-time US and Russian double agent. Pre-war Effi was a German movie star before joining the underground, helping to smuggle Jews out of war-torn Germany and has now resumed her career. In this instalment they are back in Berlin with their adopted daughter, Rosa, and living close to Effi\u2019s sister, Zarah; Russell\u2019s German son now working in London. Russell senses that his espionage work is becoming ever more perilous and the situation in Berlin is putting Effi under-pressure. As with the previous books, Russell is shuttled around Europe, visiting Trieste, Belgrade, Vienna and Prague, getting into various scrapes as he looks for an escape route. And he\u2019s still in cahoots with Shchepkin, his Russian handler, who is also looking for a way out of Stalin\u2019s regime. Effi meanwhile has her own, more local adventures. As well as tell the central tale, Downing uses the narrative to set a wider context of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and East Germany after the war, the rat lines used to smuggle Croatian war criminals out of Europe, and the lead-in to the Berlin airlift. The plot is a bit of a slow burner and relies on a couple of plot devices, though these give a glimpse into the plight of those caught behind the iron curtain and the doubts of German communists realising that the Soviets have an iron grip. Nonetheless, it\u2019s an interesting read, picks up pace and tension towards the end, and does a nice job of closing out what is a fine series, with two strong lead characters."}], "description": "Berlin, 1948.
