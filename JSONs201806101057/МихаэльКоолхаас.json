When Kohlhaas returns and finds his horses have been beaten and abused, he demands they be restored to their original condition and returned to him. The nobleman von Tronka refuses, and soon Kohlhaas is at war with the powers that be, not only in Saxony but in his native Brandenburg as well. Although I like Michael Kohlhaas for the absurdity of its universe, I love it for the Romantic folly of its hero. He is a relentless man who requires one small thing, a thing which is owed him. and he is prepared to burn down a country to get what he is rightly his due. But my favorite detail of the novel is the mysterious aura surrounding the small paper Kohlhaas carries with him, the paper which makes his last triumphant gesture possible: is it the gift of a random fortune teller, or the gift of a loving ghost in disguise?"}, {"userName": "Jan-Maat", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat", "userReview": "[ precise form of death may vary depending on your jurisdiction (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "brian   ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian", "userReview": "the repetition contained within this novella raises, once again, the perennial question regarding a strategy in which the narrative structure itself is meant to mimic and/or reinforce the work's major theme; a kind of narrative onomatopoeia, if you will. one considers godard's slow-moving 15 minute tracking shot of traffic in weekend and wonders if his point (a cinematic representation of the repetition & monotony of a particular aspect of contemporary life) comes across or if just bores the living shit out of the uninitiated and those who do love it are only the filmgeeks who dig it as an artistic device void of any true political meaning... the repetition in michael kohlhaas, used as a means to convey the over-and-over-again folly and stupidity of mankind, is sure to turn off some folks, but i guess kleist'd prolly answer with a nice bumsen sie sie. the novella concerns the titular farmer, in his attempt to transport a few of his horses, being stopped by a landowner who demands a tax. when kohlhaas can't pay up, the landowner houses said animals until kohlhaas retrieves the money. thing is: there never was a tax. and kohlhaas's horses end up getting ill. a vicious legal battle ensues and shit snowballs until kohlhaas turns all enemy of the state, raises an army, sacks a number of villages, and martin luther (yeah, the martin luther) intervenes to act as liaison between church and state and civilian. lotsa interesting points about man and his relation to the state and church, but the real genius here is kleist's ability to get inside a seemingly irrelevant argument and show how it can realistically lead to... anything. yeah, people really are that petty and retarded. kleist is a master at illustrating how human behavior, action, & word is so often wildly misinterpreted; and, plainly stated, how often people just get shit wrong. michael kohlhaas is a kind of kafka precursor and i'm sure 'ol franz slobbered and ejaculated all over his edition of its pages. as he should have. philip roth is obsessed with this kinda stuff, too, but sees a silver lining in the whole mess; he sees, perhaps, the very meaning of life in misinterpretation... a somewhat comforting notion. roth on interactions with other people: \"You get them wrong before you meet them, while you're anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you're with them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion... The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. That's how we know we're alive: we're wrong. Maybe the best thing would be to forget being right or wrong about people and just go along for the ride. But if you can do that -- well, lucky you.\""}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16077597-matt", "userReview": "You better not mess with Michael Kohlhaas!Kohlhaas was a model 16th century citizen. He was one of the most righteous people around. He was God-fearing, benevolent, just, and faithful. And then he became a raider and a murderer. And the reason for this was his righteousness.That's pretty much the summary of the first paragraph in Kleist's novella. I pondered a while what else there is to say about this book that may want you to read it, because read it you must. In the end I think the above should be enough. The actual case that started with two ill-kept horses, and a beaten-up servant, isn't really important. It's also not important, which means K. has applied to gain justice. The important thing, to me, is the question of what you would do after everything you can legally do has failed and justice still wasn't served? K.'s claims are justified. But the people who should rule the case are not interested, they are corrupt, and they have family-ties with the accused party. So there is no one left for K. to turn to and he has but two options left: 1) let the matter rest [and open the door to further acts of despotism] or 2) take the law in his own hands.He chose option #2. He started a violent feud against the accused, Junker Wenzel von Tronka, and then later the state of Saxony. And he had every right to do so! \u2014 well, almost. Feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments in the Holy Roman Empire up until the year 1495 when the law about the \nPerpetual Public Peace\n was proclaimed and feuds were outlawed [although they continued well into the 16th century]. That was a pivotal moment in legal history. The law basically states: From now on we, the rulers, are the only ones in the country who are legally allowed to use violence. You, the ruled, must not use violence in any case, or else we use violence against you.Since K.'s times lots and lots of laws were proclaimed, and as a believer in the legal system that I still am, I think most of these laws are good. Violence committed by ordinary people is still outlawed, and that's a good thing, of course, one of the best there is. The only exception is violence committed in self-defense [I'm talking about German law here]. But, I see more and more cases in Germany and other countries where the legal system doesn't seem to work very well anymore. It seems to me there are a growing number of laws that do not serve the people, at least not all of them equally. And there are more and more cases where justice \u2013 at least as far as I can see it \u2013 isn't served. The gap between being right and getting right is larger than ever. Sometimes the person who allegedly committed the crime is not even brought to trial [Yes, I'm talking about the Eric Garner case, which sadly isn't even a case].When the separation of powers [which didn't exist in the 16th century] doesn't work anymore, when two or more powers begin to work hand in hand, I think it's high time to think how to proceed. I can perfectly understand the people who hold up banners like \"No Justice, No Peace\" in the streets of New York City after the Garner incident. Those people marched peacefully, and I totally agree, but did they succeed? Will they ever succeed? Or is the time nigh for another Michal Kohlhaas to try once more option #2?To end on a happy note: Here's the original first paragraph of the above mentioned law of 1495 in its original form (15th century German). I've had a hard time deciphering it.\u00a7 1.

The Kohlhaas in the film, depicted by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen, is not a man of many words and he rather let his actions speak for him.\nThe are some outstanding shots of the landscape, and the minimalist score is very effective (solo cello, drums, flute). The violence is tuned down to a bearable (and necessary) level and there is hardly any blood on the scene, but you will know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s a good movie and I can recommend it, if you\u2019re into historical drama. The film is in no way a substitute for the book, though. The main elements of the plot are there, but there\u2019s also a lot that\u2019s missing, especially the notorious \u201cZettel\u201d (the slip of paper) which becomes so important and gives the ending of the book an additional meaning. Anyway, that\u2019s a film even a non-cineaste, like me, can enjoy.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Cem", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47751188-cem", "userReview": "Neden bu kitab\u0131 okudum; tak\u0131nt\u0131 olur bende, bir yazara ba\u015flad\u0131\u011f\u0131m zaman, e\u011fer be\u011fendiysem, t\u00fcm kitaplar\u0131n\u0131 okuma iste\u011fi gelir i\u00e7ime.

I laughed aloud at the absurdity of it, and yeah, I thought of Kafka more than once. Kleist's grasp of storytelling is phenomenal here - it all happens so quickly, and because the thing goes for 100 pages or so we're soon surrounded by a labyrinth of no less complexity (probably greater complexity) than the one faced by K. in The Castle. I mean, this is off the scale. And it's thrilling, to see the contortions Kleist can put his characters through with so few words. As the third night was falling he assaulted the castle with this handful of men, riding down the toll-keeper and the guard who were standing in conversation in the gateway. They set fire to every outhouse in the curtilage, and as these burst into flames Kohlhaas rushed into the castle to find the Junker, while Herse dashed up the spiral staircase into the warden's tower and fell with cut and thrust upon him and the steward, who were sitting half undressed playing cards together. It was as if the avenging angel of heaven had descended on the place. The Junker, amid much laughter, was in the act of reading aloud to a gathering of young friends the edict issued to him by the horse-dealer: but no sooner had he heard the latter's voice in the courtyard than, turning white as a sheet, he cried out to the company: 'Brother's, save yourselves!' and vanished. Kohlhaas entered the hall, seized Junker Hans von Tronker, as he came towards him, by the jerkin and hurled him into a corner, dashing out his brains against the stones.Kleist can do action - can do it as well as Hammett - and he can do intricacies, a whole tangle of ridiculous, confounding, infuriating intricacies the like of which Kafka wrestled with so often. The Wiki entry says Kafka devoted one of only two public appearances in his life to reading passages from Michael Kohlhaas. Robert Walser's best story, 'Kleist in Thun', made clear his affection for this man. It's hardly necessary to say it, but for 1811 this is incredible stuff, and for all time it's pretty great. At a time like this, when myriad distractions stop me reading further than a few pages into so many books, to find something like this that grabs me so strongly, that's thrilling and perplexing and thought-provoking all at once, well, it's a blessed relief. Don't ask me what the ending is about though.

A horse trader from Brandenburg on a journey to Saxony is falsely extorted for a border crossing by the Squire Wenzel von Tronka, who also keeps two of Kohlhaas\u2019 horses as surety against the trader\u2019s inability to pay. Upon arriving at Saxony, Kohlhass learns that, as he suspected, the border tax was a ruse and on his return journey demands his horses back from the squire. Instead he finds that the servant he had left in charge of the horses was beaten and run out of the castle, and the horses so maltreated and overworked that they are on the point of dying. Infuriated, Kohlhaas demands reparation and thus a saga of justice denied begins. How far would you go to redress wounded pride? At what point is the pursuit of justice an exercise in diminishing returns or even downright revolt? When is a citizen justified in renouncing his duties to the state if the state does not provide him with protection and justice? All of these questions are examined in this smart and compelling novella written by Heinrich von Kleist in the 19th century. It is obvious that von Kleist sympathizes with Kohlhaas throughout the tale, and the reader can\u2019t help but do the same. Squire Tronka is pictured as the worst kind of nepotistic nobleman, calling on his family connections at court to have all of Kohlhaas\u2019 lawful attempts at receiving justice thwarted. As Kohlhaas\u2019 frustration mounts, so does ours. When his wife, who had pleaded with her husband to be allowed to carry his final petition to the court of the Elector in the assurance that this last ditch attempt to breach the courtly barriers of favouritism and ritual would be successful, is brought back to his home wounded and near death as the result of a mishap at court he can take no more.Kohlhaas sends a decree to Tronka demanding that his horses be fattened and brought back to health at the Squire\u2019s expense and returned to the horse dealer, along with reparation for the injuries suffered by his servant at the hands of the Squire\u2019s men. Of course, this produces no result and so Kohlhaas, driven to the edge of endurance acquires a troop of men and proceeds to Tronka castle, intent on taking justice for himself if no one else will grant it to him. Kohlhaas is obviously not a man who believes in the old adage about revenge, for he takes his hot and at the end of a flaming torch as he burns Tronka castle to the ground. He pursues the Squire with a blind eye, killing nearly all whom he finds in the castle without distinction and while we may look at his response as extreme I have to admit that I couldn\u2019t help but experience a bout of schadenfreude at the Squire\u2019s turn from a smug, insolent bastard into a frightened, mewling kitten who probably pissed his pants when we discover thatthe Squire, who, to the accompaniment of immoderate laughter, was just reading aloud to a crowd of young friends the decree which the horse-dealer had sent to him, had no sooner heard the sound of his voice in the courtyard than, turning suddenly pale as death, he cried out to the gentlemen\u2014\"Brothers, save yourselves!\" and disappeared.Uncaring of the safety of his guests, Tronka escapes Kohlhaas\u2019 vengeful hand via a secret door and makes haste to a convent that is run, not surprisingly, by his aunt. Kohlhass, disappointed but not defeated, pursues his quarry and a game of cat and mouse ensues. It turns out that the Squire had managed to piss of many more than just the poor horse dealer and as Kohlhaas proclaims his just vengeance to the world, men start to flock to his banner. Soon he is an out-and-out outlaw, burning down the towns that dare keep his victim from Kohlhaas\u2019 hands and the state decides that it must intervene. Matters take a roller coaster turn as Kohlhaas first defies the authorities stating that he is justified in his actions, whatever \u201claws\u201d he may be breaking, for:\"I call that man cast out,\" answered Kohlhaas, clenching his fist, \"who is denied the protection of the laws. For I need this protection, if my peaceable business is to prosper. Yes, it is for this that, with all my possessions, I take refuge in this community, and he who denies me this protection casts me out among the savages of the desert; he places in my hand\u2014how can you try to deny it?\u2014the club with which to protect myself.\"A point that many philosophers might debate, on either side, but a compelling argument nonetheless. Finally Kohlhaas approaches Martin Luther himself, and after some argument the latter agrees to intercede for him to the elector in the name of justice.It\u2019s at this time that the story takes yet another turn and Kohlhaas the outlaw becomes Kohlhaas the plaintiff as he is apparently granted amnesty for his ravages in the countryside and waits for the interminable grind of the courts to proceed to his case. Of course things do not run smoothly and the ups and downs of Kohlhass\u2019 fortunes are many. In the end it can be said that Kohlhaas both receives and satisfies the requirements of justice and the story itself is a very compelling one that asks some important questions. I enjoyed this work thoroughly. It was a gripping examination of human nature that presents us with a problem that has no easy answers."}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1990904-wanda", "userReview": "Project Gutenberg - http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12060Archive.org - https://archive.org/details/germancla...Karen found another Project Gutenberg ebook which contains both a different translation and an interactive table of contents.

She was dismissed for improper conduct and immorality. The evidence on this was weak because the lone witness to this was the school janitor whose testimony was not only shot full of holes, but he even reported the incident quite very late--around five months after it supposedly happened. A court, however, gave credence to the charge because of another evidence, a declaration of the doctor himself allegedly during one interview when he made this cryptic statement: \"lumagpas kami sa hindi dapat kalagpasan\" (roughly, \"we went beyond the bounds of propriety\"). This, the court construed, IS evidence that the two indeed had sex and were having an affair.Non sequitur, clearly. But to argue for the woman (who was my client) I felt I had to come up with something more than the rules of logic which most judges/justices do not understand. That was when I remembered a 1001 book that I've read, \"The Princess of Cleves\" by Madame de La Fayette. Here, the Princess of Cleves was so stricken with remorse, and confessed her \"infidelity\" to her husband, just because she became enamoured to another man--even if they haven't even touched each other or had professed love to one another. To her, the \"bounds of propriety\" had been transgressed even without sex. The doctor's statement, assuming he alluded to something between her and the employee, could be that, I argued.But, wait a minute, what book am I reviewing now? Ah, yes, \"Michael Kohlhaas\". With the above digression, the task now is to make a connection between Michael Kohlhaas and the Princess of Cleves, sort of unite them in holy matrimony (ha, ha). This is a task which isn't difficult because not only do the novels' respective titles carry the names of their principal protagonists, the latter themselves have one outstanding similarity. Like the Princess of Cleves, Michael Kohlhaas was a moral and upright man. He was a horse trader, wealthy, married (and therefore cannot marry the Princess anymore) and with several young children. Someone did an injustice to him concerning several horses he was selling. He first went to the courts for relief. But his adversary used his wealth and connections to frustrate his quest for justice. His suit was dismissed. Michael Kohlhaas, however, had an acute sense of justice, a passion for right which could not tolerate the immorality of worldly institutions.So what did he do? He gathered men and arms and stormed the castle of his adversary, intending to catch him and force him to answer for his misdeeds. He sacked the castle, killed some of his adversary's men, but his prey escaped. So Michael Kohlhaas raided one place after another looking for the man. He became a brigand and an outlaw.I will not spoil your fun of reading this so I will stop here. Enough to say that the novel's fearless, bittersweet ending put me in deep, deep thought. I asked myself: who stands condemned before the eyes of God, the one who is driven to great lawlessness because he, with a pure heart, wouldn't want to compromise justice even in seemingly petty concerns, or is it he, who has done nothing openly which the law can successfully prosecute him for, but is nevertheless a \"practical man\" (or an unprincipled lout, depending on how you want him described) who does not hesitate to wheel and deal, to subvert justice with a little bribery and influence-peddling here and there?If I get to defend a client like Michael Kohlhaas, I know now which book to cite."}, {"userName": "kostas  vamvoukakis", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14057149-kostas-vamvoukakis", "userReview": "\u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03be\u03b5\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5. \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u039a\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03ce \u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1... \u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1"}, {"userName": "Derian ", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8384244-derian", "userReview": "Estos alemanes son unas m\u00e1quinas.

A partir de ah\u00ed, de ese hecho m\u00ednimo, la novela se va a ir yendo progresivamente al carajo y se va ir complejizando cada vez m\u00e1s. Hay quema de palacios y pueblos enteros, una aparici\u00f3n estelar de Lutero, viejas gitanas adivinas, una decapitaci\u00f3n. Kleist es un zarpado y seguro jugando \u00e9l solo y en patas le ganaba el mundial a Messi.

Detto questo, mi \u00e8 piaciuto molto, ma ho subito delle influenze esterne, infatti ho letto Michael Kohlhaas solo dopo aver visto l'omonimo film del 2013 di Arnaud des Palli\u00e8res (che naturalmente non \u00e8 stato distribuito in Italia), inoltre il saggio in fondo al libro di Stefan Zweig su Kleist mi ha fatto amare profondissimamente questo autore e questo ha avuto un peso nelle mie considerazioni finali sul racconto.Usando le parole di Zweig, Michael Kohlhaas \u00e8 \"il pi\u00f9 bello, il pi\u00f9 significativo tipo d'esageratore che Kleist abbia creato, l'uomo che, portandole all'eccesso, spinge alla distruzione le sue energie pi\u00f9 alte, la dirittura a testardaggine, il senso della legalit\u00e0 a prepotenza\" e credo che non ci sia modo migliore per descrivere questo personaggio. Michael Kohlhaas \u00e8 estremo e il lettore non pu\u00f2 fare a meno di amarlo o odiarlo. Mi ha ricordato in questo le tragedie greche, dove anche la virt\u00f9, quando \u00e8 eccessiva, viene punita perch\u00e9 gli dei sono invidiosi, perch\u00e9 \u00e8 pericolosa e pu\u00f2 trasformarsi nel suo contrario. Kohlhaas pecca di hybris e il finale non pu\u00f2 che risolversi in modo inevitabile e tragicamente ironico. Ho amato questo racconto per le passioni forti, eccessive, che vengono per\u00f2 raccontate in modo meditato e controllato. Tant'\u00e8 vero che lo stesso Kohlhaas appare freddo, troppo lucido, razionale e ostinato nelle sue decisioni. Ma anche questo fa parte delle sue contraddizioni e della sua mancanza di misura.Nel film questo lato del personaggio viene ammorbidito e Kohlhaas appare pi\u00f9 come un uomo comune e giusto che come un eroe, un semidio, lontano dai sentimenti comuni. Kohlhaas \u00e8 un padre affettuoso e un marito fedele e appassionato, ci si affeziona e si prova pena per lui, mentre nel romanzo si riesce a mantenere una certa distanza e a vedere la vicenda dall'esterno. Ma, ripeto, questa sua freddezza e rigidit\u00e0 \u00e8 in qualche modo tipica dell'eroe tragico votato al suo destino.In questo Kohlhaas rappresenta anche l'esempio perfetto di personaggio romantico o tardo-romantico. Mi chiedo perch\u00e9 al liceo non facciano studiare Kleist. L'avrei amato. Lui stesso \u00e8 il perfetto prototipo di scrittore romantico, votato all'eccesso, ad essere incompreso dagli altri e all'inevitabile tragica fine. Il saggio di Zweig mi ha aperto un mondo e sicuramente legger\u00f2 altro di Kleist, figura pi\u00f9 affascinante lui dei suoi personaggi."}, {"userName": "Jeroen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1261617-jeroen", "userReview": "The introduction of my version of Kohlhaas waxes over Kafka's infatuation with von Kleist, an author who had to some extent been vilified in the nineteenth century for his wilful inversions of the romantic mode. Though he was considered a Romantic, there is little of the violently throbbing heart, little Sturm und Drang, to his prose. Rather, it seems finely calibrated, and indeed in its labyrinthine ways bears a resemblance to Kafka.Kohlhaas is a small man who, on the face of it, can no longer bear his smallness. He is, like Kafka's protagonists, ruled by complex layers of overlapping states and sovereignties, and never quite seems to know whom to protest to when feeling slighted. While his quest ostensibly concerns righting a wrong done to him by a nearby nobleman, there seems to be something larger at stake, a kind of cutting through the bullshit. It is this, probably, which endears him to the populace in spite of his terrorising them. As such, he can be seen as a precursor to the heroes of the American Wild West, those at least who at all times attempted to balance their crimes with their internal sense of moral right. Even if they got it wrong, it was the thought that counted.The romantic element in all this is of course the idea of making or breaking one's own life: to not be a mere plaything of history. There is something sadly quixotic to that, though. If Michael Kohlhaas's story tells us anything, it is that the (romantic) idea of slipping out of the Promethean bounds of one's historical truisms is more often than not a (romantic) fallacy: one only ends up being even more tightly subjected to the whims of those who seem forever far away; to the whims of Important Men."}, {"userName": "Jessica Hansen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46075070-jessica-hansen", "userReview": "Edit Review:I read this book again even if I originally didn't enjoyed it at all because of a discussion I had with my boyfriend. I have to say that I still don't like this book but I think it deserves 2.5 stars instead of 1 star. The story itself is actually quite interesting. I don't like Kohlhaas as a protagonist because I think his revenge is exaggerated but I think the plot of the story is meaningful and that is why I change my review after reading this again on my own. I know I wrote that I hated the writing and I still don't enjoy the writing style but I have to remind myself that it was written 1850 and maybe I shouldn't rate it so harsh. ----Michael Kohlhaas is a book I was forced to read as a school assignment and I hated it. I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that I didn't read it by choice or that we read it most of the time in class - no! It is a terrible book in my opinion. The writing is unbearable.

Sent\u00ed que contra\u00eda una especie de deuda con Yuri, por lo que me anim\u00e9 a probar un poquito a Kleist a ver qu\u00e9 pod\u00eda ofrecerme el autor. Pens\u00e9 que la obra de Kleist ser\u00eda harina del mismo costal que Doctor Zhivago, es decir, pesimismo realista con peque\u00f1os toques m\u00edsticos muy chulos. Nada m\u00e1s lejos de la realidad.Empezamos por la sinopsis: \"...en ella donde se dan cita todos los fantasmas interiores que atormentaron su breve pero fecunda existencia [...]sinti\u00f3 el mundo como una inmensa f\u00e1brica de miseria y tribulaci\u00f3n, prefigura con esta narraci\u00f3n el mundo simb\u00f3lico y on\u00edrico de Kafka\". \u00bfDe verdad? Esta debe de tratarse de una burda obra ap\u00f3crifa puesto que no he encontrado nada de lo que la sinopsis promet\u00eda.B\u00e1sicamente en la historia que recibe el nombre de su protagonista Kleist reinterpreta, a partir de una antigua cr\u00f3nica del siglo XVI, un episodio casi legendario sobre un tratante de caballer\u00edas querido por todo el vecindario, poseedor una alquer\u00eda productiva y a su cargo una buena esposa y unos cuantos churumbeles; en pocas palabras, un hombre respetable. Y as\u00ed es hasta que un d\u00eda exigen a Kohlhaas pagar un arancel por pasar la frontera al dirigirse este a una feria y vender sus caballos. El propietario del castillo, el Junker de Tonka, pide adem\u00e1s como pr\u00e9stamo dos potrillos moros que Kohlhaas podr\u00e1 llevarse tras su retorno a casa, mas a la vuelta estos est\u00e1n en un estado vegetativo, su propietario pide al Junker explicaciones de por qu\u00e9 su criado no se ha encargado de los potros. Este le asegura que se debi\u00f3 a que el hombre era un insolente metomentodo. Ya un poco mosca, Kohlhaas vuelve a su hogar donde el criado, hecho unos zorros, le explica que lo echaron a patadas del castillo por querer que los potros no fueran tratados como animales de tiro. Con todo el revuelo que surge alrededor de este delito, Michael Kohlhaas impone una querella al Junker por la injusticia cometida contra sus potros y el criado que meses despu\u00e9s es desestimada y tachada de \"pedanter\u00eda ociosa\" por la propia justicia. A partir de entonces, y con el desarrollo de tr\u00e1gicos acontecimientos, Kohlhaas emprende una aut\u00e9ntica cruzada contra la justicia de su pa\u00eds y obtener su venganza.No he podido meterme en la lectura desde el mismo momento que se plante\u00f3 el problema. En todo momento me sacaba de la historia una pregunta: \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 tanto por tan poco?\" Esa sigue siendo mi pregunta. Muchas injusticias de las cometidas a lo largo de la historia han pasado por menos, sin embargo, es imposible que no chirr\u00ede hasta limites insoportables para los sentidos auditivos que Kohlhaas condenase a la muerte a tanta gente inocente por unos potrillos. Habiendo hecho una buena caja en la feria, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 preocuparte por m\u00e1s? Yo ni hubiese vuelto al castillo por mi pr\u00e9stamo, habr\u00eda dejado como regalo al Junker los caballos y me hubiera marchado a mi casa con mi familia, porque es lo que se hace cuando tienes gente bajo tu responsabilidad, no ponerlos en peligro como ha hecho Michael Kohlhaas todo el relato. Esos actos belicosos no se justifican por lo que sucedi\u00f3 despu\u00e9s del \"robo\" de los potros. La personalidad de Kohlhaas me ha resultado incluso pedante. En la persecuci\u00f3n de su objetivo no se da cuenta que la persona que, supuestamente, \u00e9l m\u00e1s quer\u00eda le rog\u00f3 encarecidamente que no tomase las armas por ella, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 lo hace entonces? Aqu\u00ed se ve claramente que no existe una raz\u00f3n real, que el emprende esa cruzada porque le apetece. Y, repito, poniendo en peligro a su familia. Lo que m\u00e1s me ha gustado de este aspecto es cuando intenta que el representante terrenal de la justicia divina lo perdone por lo que ha hecho y este lo manda a la mierda sutilmente.Tampoco he podido interesarme por la historia y lo que suced\u00eda por eso mismo aunque confieso que muchas partes de la misma est\u00e1n plagadas de sutiles cr\u00edticas que no est\u00e1n exentas de raz\u00f3n. Es un relato que yo considero que trasciende el tiempo como buenamente puede; la justicia sigue estando igual de corrupta, impera el amiguismo y los lazos de sangre para juzgar la inocencia o la culpabilidad de una persona y gente que vive de las ilusiones e ideales como Kohlhaas.Al margen de eso no hay nada m\u00e1s que yo considere destacable. Supongo que esperaba una historia m\u00e1s introspectiva donde se plantearan los problemas morales a los que se enfrenta Kohlhaas con sus actos de barbarismo, adem\u00e1s de una evoluci\u00f3n m\u00ednima con la culpa que recae sobre sus espaldas. Pero no he encontrado esto, por lo tanto, ha sido una historia que aunque con un trasfondo pol\u00edtico interesante no he podido disfrutar. \u00bfVolver\u00e9 a leer a Kleist? Tal vez. Realmente es un autor que me ha interesado en otros aspectos. Me gusta como escribe y su gran dominio del lenguaje (tanto por parte de \u00e9l como del traductor, un trabajo excelente) pero esta historia no me ha gustado, pese a quien le pese. Le\u00eddo para el Marat\u00f3n Breve :)."}, {"userName": "Ari", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63336213-ari", "userReview": "\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u044d\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0439\u0433 \u0445\u0430\u043c\u0433\u0430\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0445\u0433\u04af\u0439 \u0431\u0430\u0439\u0433\u0430\u0430 \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440 \u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0434 \u0431\u0438 \u0430\u043c\u044c\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0447 \u0431\u0430\u0439\u0436 \u0447\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0445\u0433\u04af\u0439! ~ \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u044d\u043b\u044c \u041a\u043e\u043e\u043b\u0445\u0430\u0430\u0441"}], "description": "Based on historical events, this thrilling saga of violence and retribution bridges the gap between Medieval and modern literature, and speaks so profoundly to the contemporary spirit that it has been the basis of numerous plays, movies, and novels.It has become, in fact, a classic tale: that of the honorable man forced to take the law into his own hands.
