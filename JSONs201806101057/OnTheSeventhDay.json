Often compared to his compatriot, Irvine Welsh, I find that\u2019s a tad lazy as he has a completely different writing style. I find that Mr Wilsons work is more subtle and deeply considered than the full throttle assault Irvine welsh often adopts.When approaching this book and reading the little teasers (again the Irvine welsh comparison was made) like \"God hates you. Regardless of religion, race, sex, sexuality or nationality. He hates all of you. Basically, you are fucked.\"\u2026it would be fair to say I was expecting a full on twisted barrage of anti-religious abuse. Whereas what Mark Wilson does with this book is to gently satirise religion by way of the retelling of biblical stories through the eyes of \u201cNick\u201d who is one of the main characters in the book, while The other main characters wreak havoc in the present as Jesus is resurrected by way of inhabiting the body of a nondescript Scotsman, along with Moses as his right hand man inhabiting the body of a Manchester United footballer.So the book has two streams throughout, That of Jay and Mo, trying to convince the entire world (every single one of us) that they must repent and adopt the one and only true commandment that God (Stuart) asked Moses to impart to the human race, which was, \u201cdon\u2019t be a cunt\u201d , before Moses got idea\u2019s above his station and carved out those other nonsensical 10 commandments back in the day.The world looks on in disbelief and shock as Jay and Mo perform miracle after miracle at various points around the world (spread like wild fire by social media). Whilst the miracles convince many, the media, sceptics (and a deadly agent provocateur) cause their own havoc by their usual underhanded skulduggery and cynicism. Whilst all this is going on the story unveils new characters and twists. The afore mentioned Nick has his own issues with God / Stuart (an angrier more cynical God you could never meet).These characters, especially Nick, take us to different places and theories and this adds to the books mystery and intrigue in such a way that it helps prevent the book from being a simply witty farce as Wilson shows just how much he researched his biblical theories and then reconstructed them (or was it de constructed) them through his magical Wilson eyes before putting pen to paper. The result is a thoroughly entertaining, controversial, thought provoking, funny, outrageous (at times) story of what could happen if God or the son of God was to reveal him/herself to the modern world. The phrase \u201cyou\u2019re talking through your arse\u201d takes on a whole new meaning in this story and literally had me laughing out loud!Miracles are either believed by half the people or considered trickery or blasphemy by the other half\u2026and let\u2019s face it I know which camp I would fall in if a Scotsman and a premier league footballer called a press conference telling us they are Moses and Jesus reincarnated and we must all repent of God will fuck us over\u2026in 7 days. On the seventh Day genuinely makes you think how we would react of the son of God made an appearance in these fucked up sceptical, religiously divided times whilst also being able to make you guffaw (or Tut in outrage, if you are that way inclined).I loved On the seventh day and would highly recommend this to any of my friends and family and readers of the End Fanzine\u2026\u2026talking of which, at one point in the book Jesus / Jay even receives a tweet from The End fanzine (yes really!) asking him if he\u2019s up for an interview!...you can imagine my delight and pride at having our little fanzine included in the work of one Mark Wilson\u2026go buy this book now, you won\u2019t be disappointed..and while you\u2019re at it, have a look through Mark Wilsons other body of works and try them too. The man has such a great talent and should already be a literary star\u2026.just like that cunt Irvine Welsh."}, {"userName": "Anja V", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63418989-anja-v", "userReview": "Hilarious, progressive, provocative, surprisingly thought-provoking and genuinely unique.

It is also going to get some nasty reviews. It is blasphemous, progressive, raw as fuck and hilarious. But it also has something to say about the world, about us, and our responsibility for ourselves and our world. It doesn\u2019t get much better than that for me.I was privileged to be a beta reader for this book, and it was the most challenging beta-read I\u2019ve ever done. I was simply too caught up in the story, too lost in the universe to be focused on finding those little details which need to be ferreted out before publication. I\u2019ve just put it down and I\u2019m already ready to read it again.On the Seventh Day is definitely not for everyone. Do yourself a favor and read the blurb. Are you offended?

NRA sponsored militia's in the 'bible' belt may. Those Christians who would turn their back on refugees fleeing warzones may. Those church goers who would snatch what little dignity the poor have left may. If that\u2019s you then I'm glad you wasted your money, though given the blurb well, that would make you Donald Trump stoopid.It is irreverent, no doubt. Such is the nature of satire. Satire also makes you think. Given the current state of the world, if there was a God, does the idea of him / her pressing the reset button seem so far-fetched? If you're a Christian, a proper one, not like them in the previous paragraph, wouldn\u2019t you think after yet another act of cruelty\u2026fair enough? F*ck it, this isn\u2019t working? But like good satire it's also entertaining. There are two threads interwoven. One, Jesus (Jay) and Moses (Mo) trying to save the world. The second has Satan (Nick) sitting in a bar telling his woes to a girl (haven't we all) about how it came to this. I have to say I empathised most with the Nick character. What that says about me is between me and my team of therapists. Story details, how it all ends\u2026read it and find out. Unless your one of those first paragraph people, in which case I can recommend a great film called 'The life of Brian. Trust me you'll love it.It takes guts to take on something like this. It takes writing skill to pull it off. Mr Wilson has both in spades."}, {"userName": "Darren Sant", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4175288-darren-sant", "userReview": "I've always enjoyed fiction that portrays supernatural or divine entities as if they were people. I'm thinking Pratchett & Gaiman's Good Omens, soMe of Tom Holt's fiction and films like Dogma. So I was looking forward to Mark Wilson's novel.It differs from the aforementioned works in that it is more sweary, adult and perhaps more cynical. However, this gives it a more cutting edge for me. Wilson tells his tale from a number of perspectives including that of Jesus and Moses who have returned to Earth in order to try and save the human race. The cynical response they get from people is the source of much of the humour in the novel and feels as close to reality as it's probably possible to get in this kind of novel.If you're easily offended by swearing and sexual references then this probably isn't the book for you. However, if you can look past that then you'll enjoy this book. In his own way Wilson tackles a number of deep philosophical ideas, albeit with his tongue firmly within his cheek. Interesting, funny and thoughtful. Read it."}, {"userName": "Jayne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11364559-jayne", "userReview": "Where do i start with this one it had me loving it and hating it at the same time and it played with my mind as i do have my own beliefs . The first chapter or so put me off and i thought its not for me this is the one book from Mark Wilson that i wont like . But i persevered and found myself getting more and more drawn into the story as it went . Mark takes us into a different way of thinking about god and religion and what if's in this one, but remembering that it was never written to offend and it is what it claims to be satirical. I found myself enjoying it and loved the humour patter and onliners and as always Mark has made the characters believable and likable and the scenes are easily pictured . To write something like this is a huge gamble but id say it paid off ."}, {"userName": "Chris King", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13949495-chris-king", "userReview": "Not for the easily offended,although they should read it too or they will be missing out.God is a wee bit peeved with the world,and sets two ordinary Joes (well one and a Premiership footballer)the task of restoring humanities faith in ...(well Himself).One week,that is all can they do it............Like a previous reviewer,I felt the biblical stuff in the first 3rd distracted from the flow a little,but then whammo I raced through till the end,sitting up till the wee small ours to finish.Sweary words and blasphemy are not everyone's cup of Rosie Lee,personally I can't get enough,so do yourselves a favour give this a go,it is worth the ride.This is an honest review,and not just an arse kiss to Mr Wilson ....so there."}, {"userName": "Sandy Kilpatrick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36109762-sandy-kilpatrick", "userReview": "I loved this.

Jay and Mo (Jesus and Moses) are given the job of trying to warn the human race that it's pissed God off big time, and are given new bodies to work from. As they perform miracles and try to convince people to be nicer to each other, God (Stuart) and Satan (Nick) let us in on their religious thoughts, and theories about what has gone wrong with the world.It is obvious that Mark has done a lot of biblical study to write this book, and the discussions about good vs evil, faith, and the use of miracles, are at times as philosophical as they are funny. There is a lot of swearing, and if you are religious then some parts may offend. I didn't mind the swearing, in fact, some of it is hilarious, and instead of being offended in any way, the story made me think about how I'd react if Jesus made a re-appearance and told me God hated me. I still don't know how I'd react!This is a strange mix of book. It made me howl with laughter in places, and in others made me consider my place in the universe, sometimes immediately after each other. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it. A very funny, and very clever book."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1439856-david", "userReview": "I enjoyed this.

I expected anti-religious commentary and lots of implications that religion is the cause of all evil. What I was given was a Scottish arsehole type God, sick of humans and their abject selfishness, who was hellbent on putting an end to the world and starting again. And can we blame him?Wilson is gentle with his religious commentary; I'd originally thought I'd be unable to recommend the book to some of my religious friends. In actual fact, I think they'd love it. Bible stories are referenced and twisted to help us understand some of Wilson's A-lister biblical characters, resulting in a wonderful range of back stories, development opportunities, and a true grasp of relationships. Where I thought I'd already known how relationships would be portrayed, I was wrong; the Devil loves God and seeks only to please him; Jesus and Moses are best pals who love nothing more than smoking joints and playing first-person shooters; Lazarus the head of a charitable foundation still dies and rises four days later. Although easily deemed controversial, what Wilson gives us is ultimately heartwarming, instructive, and a hell of a read.Jesus and Moses descend to earth in an attempt to talk sense into the humans, to ensure them God is watching; he's no happy, and if they continue as they are, he will bring destruction to their world. This is particularly interesting, as Wilson compares the visit to the last time Jesus was on earth. We see the power of technology and social media allow Jesus access to far many more people than he'd ever be capable of two thousand years previously. Wilson comments on traditional media reporting warped information in order to mislead and deceive the world. The articles written by the newspapers we're all familiar with were so typical of each of their views, and the tweets sent to Jesus were entirely relatable and hugely funny.I really enjoyed the exploration of Nick, the Fallen Angel, or as we know him, Satan. The journey which led to his fall was heartbreaking, and it was wonderful to connect with him. What I loved most of all was his hell, Sheoul, where humans would descend after death to be prepared for heaven. Some humans take longer than others to become pure; some are thrown to the bottom level and tortured due to their sins on earth. I particularly connected with (and many others will - although many will take offence) the idea that God-fearing humans who devoted their entire lives to their religion, took longer than most to be ready to face him. The satire is hilarious, and really something to think about.This absolutely isn't for everyone, and although it was far more subtle than I'd expected, I imagine it will still offend some. If the thought of a God with a Lanarkshire accent who has a penchant for the word cunt mortifies you, I wouldn't pick it up. For all others, I would thoroughly recommend and endorse this.One commandment: Don't be a cunt."}, {"userName": "Leila", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15044014-leila", "userReview": "Mark Wilson is fast becoming one of my favourite writers.

First things first if you are easily offended then this book isn't for you.

Of course, it doesn't quite go to plan as God, Satan, and the Angel of Death have their own agendas.
