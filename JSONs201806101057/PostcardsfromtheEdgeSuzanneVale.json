That sounds hateful, but I don't really give a shit mean it to be . (Confession: I'm not a ginormous Star Wars fan myself.) I am a huge Carrie Fisher fan, though, and it's mainly due to this book. Postcards from the Edge is a semi-autobiographical story about Carrie after coming out of a stint in rehab. I read this book when I was basically a kid and Carrie Fisher became my hero. Not because she kicked ass in a galaxy far far away, but because somehow she managed to kick it just by being herself. When Hollywood snubbed her for daring to get old and *gasp* fat, she reiterated why I adored her by giving them the middle finger (and eventually reprising the role that made her famous). She will eternally be an icon due to Princess Leia, but I think she should be remembered for being a fucking awesome chick in general.Read this book - or just watch the movie . . . ."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE is the semi-autobiographical novel based on the turbulent life of Carrie Fisher.The first third of the story recounting 30 days of actress Suzanne Vale's life in rehab was pretty intense and nerve-racking reading (for me) and if you can get through lives and stories of drug dealers, addicts and rather disgusting Hollywood types in those pages, the rest of the novel will be a breeze.While I loved the movie with its witty and sarcastic dark humor, the novel came across (for me) as kind of a downer, and except for a few similarities here and there, quite different from the flick.Overall, despite her Hollywood fame and superstar upbringing, I came away from this read feeling sad and sorry for Carrie Fisher with all the difficulties she faced with her health and life.\nCarrie Fisher: October 21, 1957 - December 27, 2016"}, {"userName": "Calista", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16731747-calista", "userReview": "I enjoyed Carrie's first novel. It was witty and interesting. Suzanne is obviously based loosely on her life from other stories I have read of hers. I feel like this was one of the first behind the scenes of Hollywood. I'm sure there were things before this, but this was a big tell-all basically.There was the rehab portion, the looking for love portion of the book and the part where she is trying to accept normal portion. I felt the dialogue was snappy, there were funny moments. I enjoy the story; I was entertained. For a debut author, I think this was a strong start. I have 3 Carrie books left."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "In her first piece of fiction, Fisher seeks to relay some sentiments through this quasi-biographical story. Suzanne Vale is an actress who has succumbed to the horrors of addiction and finds herself in a treatment facility. While there, she recounts some of her views on fellow addicts and the trials of life on the inside. Released back into her real world, Vale begins the slow process of re-establishing herself, securing a new agent while trying to return to the life she knows so well. However, as seems to be the yoke of all those who have tasted fame, she finds herself in a form of purgatory, unsure where she fits in and how others will see her. By the end of this short piece, she has found a form of amorous connection, though it is unclear if it will be long-lasting. Truly a scattering of thoughts that tries to relate back to her own life, Fisher may have work her side-buns too tightly if this is supposed to be high quality writing.I respect that everyone has their life and ideas that shape them. I also am sure that it is difficult to be a Hollywood actress and face the rigours of the bright lights and paparazzi on a daily basis. However, like all people, actors are people and have to face the everyday world. Fisher seeks, I think, to portray a form of herself in the Vale character, but it comes across more as a justification for acts and serves as a trivial and superficial approach to life. A few characters who were lacklustre and a plot... was there one? At times I was unsure what I was reading, wondering if this might be some form of monologue that sought to tell stories and anecdotes. This was not a story as much as it was a means to express herself without using her own name and experiences. If only to honour her recent passing, I will likely try the second Vale piece and see what comes of this, but I am certain to list RETURN TO SENDER on this particular postcard.Thank you Madam Fisher for your insights. Perhaps stick to recounting stories about yourself and not using a straw man in the form of Suzanne Vale.\tLove/hate the review?

AWESOME. carrie fisher, i didn't think standing around being stoned in \"the empire strikes back\" was going to prepare you for anything later in life, because that's what they taught us in DARE. but apparently it prepared you to be super observant, hilariosly witty, and amazingly devious in your vary-ing writing styles (vary-ing? what? can my editor get on that spelling please? thnx)i was amused throughout, an impressive feat because the only thing more boring than reading about people doing drugs, making bad decisions, having disgustingly casual sex, and laying around gorging themselves in self pity is watching it. (eg scorpio rising. the entire film). anyway, back to that \"moment\". i was amused throughout because i spent most of \"throughout\" thinking, oh shit, i've done that. i've thought that. i've said that exact thing, out loud, in front of a bunch of people who probably shouldn't have heard it. no matter how different the characters are from you, their stream-of-concious honesty taps those inner demons we try so very hard to keep under wraps. judgemental, annoyed, impatient, self doubting, and insecure, we've all stood in the corner of the room with the drunk housepet and simultaneously worried about our hair while berating the host for her absyminal choice in cutlery. and we don't feel bad about it either.maybe we DO need another therapy session for this, but hell, we like your writing, ms. fisher, and we don't intend to stop reading soon.(\"we\"? as in plural? as in when did this review jump from me to we? can i get an editor on that? thnx)"}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/531153-jonathan", "userReview": "Motherfucking goddam shit.

And by that, I mean the highs of drug consumption followed by the lows of withdrawal during the inevitable stay in rehab.It is truly fascinating to listen to the her voice spewing the most intricate, absurdist, intellectual and insightful witticisms, trying to catch every nuance and subtlety of the jokes that keep coming at you at a hundred miles an hour. You get a little bit of an understanding of the sheer power of Fisher's intelligence as well as wondering just how painful and exhausting it must be to live inside her out-of-control-freight-train mind. Especially in Tinsel-Town, where people quite seriously argue the merits of the Beatles over Noel Coward at a Beverly Hills soiree.The film version of Postcards from the Edge is one of my absolute all-time favorite comedies. I believe Fisher also wrote the screenplay. It was interesting to see how she worked a traditional, linear, narrative plotline out of the scattered and disjointed essays that make up these memoirs. Fisher definitely pulled the best bits out and came out with a few additional zingers for the film. What I liked most about the movie is that it emphasized the dysfunctional, whackadoodle, and fiercely loving relationship she has with her movie star legend mother Debbie Reynolds, a tour de force, genius performance by Reynolds' personal friend, Shirley Maclaine.This book, and Fisher's dry, dark, deadpan style, might be off-putting for many but I personally eat that kind of humor up, so I can't wait to delve into some of her other, more contemporary works. Princess Leia doesn't even scratch the surface of who this woman is."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2262926-maria", "userReview": "[P.S.

It's honest, fun, and quite realistic of the struggles of being a recovering \"pills addict\" and famous actress who doesn't quite know what normal is but trying to find a sense of normalcy. Like everyone in the world, Suzanne has doubts about herself, her life choices, and career as a movie star and I understood and connected with that. I'm a worrier and Suzanne is a worrier too. The only thing I didn't quite like about the plot is how we heard a little about Suzanne's mom or her co-workers on the cop movie she was working on in the book. We didn't hear more about them after the sections they were mentioned in and I would have enjoyed hearing more about how she felt about her mom and how the movie turned out. Thankfully we heard more about a few other people in Suzanne's life like her friend Lucy and her beau near the end of the book. It's a debut novel so I understand that it won't be perfect but it was still really good, but if I'm honest I could probably forget about it the more time passes.I really enjoyed listening to this audiobook as I really like Ms. Fisher's voice. She really made this listening experience that much better. I'll definitely listen to more of her audiobooks so I can her Ms. Fisher's voice more."}, {"userName": "Stacey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063553-stacey", "userReview": "For someone who suffered from drug addiction and depression, Carrie Fisher was a force to be reckoned with when it came to being in touch with her feelings. She really puts them out there in the embodiment of Suzanne Vale, the novel's main character. Geez, she must have felt incredibly vulnerable doing so, too: both as a big celebrity presence and as a former addict. If anyone in Hollywood and America didn't know her story, they knew now. And was she funny! There are some truly memorable lines here. I laughed out loud at the scene between Suzanne and Jack Burroughs, as they talk at length about their non-relationship. Not to mention, the very heady insightfulness found in the story, which is ultimately, about growing up and having hope. I could relate to many of the sound bites found here, about men, dating, love, depression, body parts. Why couldn't I articulate them as well?Since the novel takes you through late '80's Hollywood, I enjoyed guessing who many of the figures were in real life who randomly pop up throughout the book. The party scene was filled with larger-than-life assholish artistes and in one instance, I could swear Selena Warner was channeling Joan Collins.I especially like this \"gee, I wished I had thought of that\" gem gleamed from dialogue between friends and actresses Suzanne and Lucy toward the end of the novel:\"Guys are great before you know who they are,\" said Lucy. \"They're great when you're still with who they might be.\"Rest in peace, Carrie.

The book is NOTHING like the movie, except for a small part in the middle, but since Carrie also wrote the screenplay it is all good. A lot of what she says in this book rang oddly true to me which was a little confronting, but only made me love it more. Negative parts? In the beginning when alex narrates the story, he was sooooo annoying, but then again, he was a cokehead and those are known for being annoying. So point well made :P. I also recognized some stuff in the book that she now uses in her one-woman show (her mother calling up saying \"this is your mother, Doris\" and her grandmother saying flies can land on shit or pie.), but none of that lessened the book to me. I read this book in one day, so i'll wait till i move onto Surrender the Pink, but i'm sure i'll love that one too.

Here is the deal, because there is not much to tell about this book because nothing seems to happen after the character gets out of rehab.This book has no plot for 2/3rds. Sad, but true. I think Carrie Fisher is a great writer. She has a way of creating this characters that have a ton of flaws but are witty and real. I think Suzanne is her - this was her outlet, this was her way of writing out her feelings and not caring if a story came out of it. Also, Alex... why were we treated to first person narratives with him only to have him creep on Suzanne and then vanish for the rest of the book (but be mentioned off-handedly/make a cameo near the end)? Who really knows. Guess Carrie wanted to have a character that was showing the effects of coke overdose.I enjoy her memoirs a lot.

So, do something regular with your irregular life, rather than trying to get a regular one, \u2018cause you\u2019d just do something irregular with that.\u201d\nDriven by my fondness of the film adaptation, I grabbed this book from an on-sale bin from BookSale. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware of the all-star cast movie; and of Meryl Streep and Shirley McLaine\u2019s Golden Globe and Oscar\u2019s nomination for this film. The film, itself, was ill-received and closely-scrutinized though.The story revolved around Suzanne Vale, an actress and a rehab patient for drug addiction. While unlike the film, which was funny and catchy, the book was much sensible for me. It was focused on the subject of recovery from drug addiction, while the movie focused more on the constant friction between the over-bearing mother and her low-esteemed daughter.The book was written in 5 parts. The prologue was written in postcards sent to her brother, friend and grandmother. It was followed by a self-narration in journal form, covering most of her stay and acquaintances in the rehabilitation center. Then, a dialogue/monologue with a producer (turned lover) followed. The 4th part was a third-person narrative of how Suzanne is struggling to put her life together, recovering her status as an actress, and as a person in need of a worthy relationship. Brought about by the heart-to-heart talk with her sententious grandmother, Suzanne found some semblance in her struggles and took hold of some normalcy in her life. In conclusion, the 5th part was a letter addressed to the doctor who pumped her stomach during her drug overdose, prior to her rehab.Needless to say, the book was written in a very unusual style. It will either interest you more, or try your patience. Looking past that, the story and lesson applies to most of us, struggling through rehab or not, since we are all in this ever winding process of discovering and rediscovering our purpose in life. This is a vague story behind the question: When are we going to let go of what we want, and accept the things we should have?\n\u201cP.S.

The language is very fluid, seeping straight into my imagination with ease; the scenes are sometimes hilarious and other times scary but masterfully written, very impressive for a first book! For those who know anything about Carrie Fisher, they will see that the book is semi-autobiographical; sometimes truth is stranger than fiction. I loved the myriad of original analogies and wonderful sentences, the book might be small and a fast read but fun and meaningful at the same time. At one time Carrie compares Suzanne's life to bread in a bakery with her nose stuck on the wrong side of the window, watching life pass by. Few passages really jolted me with wisdom and hilarious comparison to inanimate objects added certain amount of depth to the all ready semi serious book.After an overdose, Suzanne Vale, the well known actress, finds herself in a strange place - rehab. She fells like a clich\u00e9, an unhappy actress in rehab, what a shocker. A place where TV shows such as Outer Limits are treated as perfectly normal reality, she manages to make some new friendships even though many people seem crazy to her, she of course full of internal conflict knows deep down that she belongs there as well, but wouldn't want to be back, so she needs to find her balance and stop any self abuse that she somehow managed to pull on herself, basically she needs to learn to live her life without using drugs to solve any of her problems. On her quest to normalcy she meets just about anything but that, stuck in a place with people who are stranger than the craziest cookoos, whose addictions are perfectly portrayed (just read about the typical day of self denial that Alex leads - wow) and she manages to stay out of trouble enough to be let out into the real world. Once free she starts a new project but is quickly taken down from her euphoric state by complaints from the director, being told she needs to have more fun with her character, something she has a hard time after dealing with her hard times in rehab. Slowly Suzanne realizes that her life is a marathon, not a quick sprint to the finish line, she needs to take it one step at a time and enjoy each day, especially since life glides through time so fast."}, {"userName": "Greta", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/543723-greta", "userReview": "Carrie Fisher is a trip, excuse the pun as it echoes of the first section of this novel, and I'm super glad that I've now read this and have experienced the easy, authentic, fiesty voice and the simultaneous criticality and sensitivity with which she, in and through her characters, sees and communicates the world. two quotations that stood out to me in this series of postcards and snapshots of sorts...regarding intimate relationships; something to consider:\"My route to intimacy is routine.
