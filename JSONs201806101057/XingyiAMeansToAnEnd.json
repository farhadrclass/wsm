{"ratings": 0, "userreviews": [], "description": "A book covering the tactical theories, training methods and philosophy of Xingyi as taught to Mike Patterson by the late Hsu Hong Chi of Taiwan.Shrfu Patterson is widely considered to be one of the foremost experts in the world on the art of Xingyi. With over 40 years experience (at time of writing) as a fighter, coach and teacher, he has authored a masterpiece covering all aspects of this discipline.His immense experience is gleaned from the crucible of continuous and true testing of Xingyi's tenets. The crucible of first being a successful full contact fighter himself and then following that experience by becoming a successful full contact coach, training and guiding 37 full contact champions throughout the 80's and 90's until retirement from coaching in 2000.This book covers the Hsing I (xingyi) taught to him by Hsu Hong Chi (XuHongJi) in thorough detail. Theory, mechanics and strategy of the five fists and twelve animals are covered with emphasis placed on opening/closing phases of core power generation. Perspectives on training, skill development, conditioning, meditation/energetics, partner drilling, strategy and cultivation are all discussed thoroughly. This is a work designed to present Xingyi in a plain English, straightforward manner. Great lengths are taken to explain concept with science while offering simple physical \"proofs\" to test the veracity of the methods. The author avoids subject matter that has been done to death (i.e. history) in other books to instead put forth concrete methodology allowing practitioners to \"marry\" traditional practice to real world application.To this end, the book also covers R.S.P.C.T. (Realistically Structured Progressive Combat Training). RSPCT is a contemporary methodology of translating Xingyi concepts and tactics into viable combat skills through specific partner training. This method is time tested under the pressure of full contact competition.RSPCT was invented and synthesized as a stand alone program to train effective fighting for competition or street environments. Five tiers, ten categories of training methods, drills and exercises are discussed in depth. It is a training methodology that can be applied to any martial discipline for effective real world application.The book is punctuated by personal anecdotes which drive home certain salient points within the scope of the work as only a person who has lived this path can ascertain.The book contains 266 pages, at 8 1/2 x 11, and over 700 photos and illustrations.
