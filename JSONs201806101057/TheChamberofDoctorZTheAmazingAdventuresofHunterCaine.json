An Amazing Adventure of Hunter Caine, the story came with the tease of a \"perpetually horny Lesbian contact killer and paranormal fixer\" and the promise of a \"land of monsters and mayhem.\" It delivers on both counts.This was pure pulp - an erotically charged, adventure-based bit of horror, complete with monsters, mad scientists, cool weapons, and more. It's a frantically paced short story that doesn't really spend much time on introductions, much less character building, but it has spades of blood, guts, explosions, and ribald flirting. It's so over-the-top that it could have been eye-rollingly bad, especially with the gender-flipped vintage James Bond \"wrong place, wrong time, wrong girl\" seduction, but the cheesy sexuality (and equally cheesy dialogue) actually keep it on track.You're not quite sure who the good guys and the bad guys are, and even when you're expecting to be double-crossed, you don't necessarily know how or from where. The monsters come on fast and hard, delivering a level of splatterpunk violence that's perfect for the story, and Hunter is just one of those bad-ass characters you like from the get-go. What little character building there is happens in the final pages, and it's more than enough to make me want to take on another amazing adventure.http://beauty-in-ruins.blogspot.ca/20..."}, {"userName": "Andrew Weston", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8483681-andrew-weston", "userReview": "You know you\u2019re onto a sure thing as soon as you start reading, for our heroine \u2013 Hunter Caine \u2013 opens the story with a brief monologue which ends; \u201cYou want something done? Something dirty? Something dangerous? Something distasteful? Call Hunter. You got the cash. I got the flash.\u201dThat sets the tone for what follows \u2013 a monstrously entertaining short story that can be devoured in one sitting \u2013 which, coincidentally \u2013 is what would happen to you if you were to fall prey of one of the zombified shamblers spawned by the fiendish Dr. Z.Hot chicks; alpha males; guns and gore aplenty; unstoppable ghouls; and witty \u2013 gritty dialogue that makes you smile all the way through. What can I say, it\u2019s rip-roaring fun! And Hunter Caine is a whole different ball game to your usual lead character; someone who doesn\u2019t care how the job gets done as long as there\u2019s a pay check at the end of it!If you like your action with graphic novel hotitude, then this adventure is for you."}], "description": "Hunter Caine, Soldier of Fortune, while on a job to rescue a kidnapped scientist finds herself face to face with a zombie horde.
