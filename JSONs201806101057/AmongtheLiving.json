I should have put it down when I read this line:...reaches the fence but keeps trying to walk forward like a retarded kid.Then I read this line:He slams it back home and jerks the barrel back so there is one in the chamber...and decided I'd keep reading for the laughs. I made quite a few more notations on my Kindle, but I won't bother to transcribe them all here. Suffice it to say that Mr. Long makes the grievous error of attempting to write about things like medicine and firearms without bothering to take the time to make even a cursory Google search to see what, for instance, Coumadin would do for a hemorrhagic stroke, or how a pistol is loaded. Women in the novel are treated with levels of misogyny and chauvinism that I would expect from a hormone-addled and poorly raised high-school boy. Multiple chapters are written as a platform to describe sex and sadism fantasies and make no attempt to advance the plot.In short, this book should have remained a private endeavor, locked in a drawer in a desk. I feel cheated to have spent my time on it; don't dare make the mistake of spending money on it."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Among The Living takes place in Seattle and starts out sharing with the reading audience the lives of four different people in the city. The author uses both third and first person perspectives as we go through the routines of their days. Hints of the start of an undead uprising are sprinkled throughout the story but much of the early part of the book keeps that as background noise for most of the characters...there is a gas leak in a neighborhood, it is cordoned off, there are strange stories on the internet but the news networks are saying nothing and the stories are disappearing as quickly as they appear. As the story rolls on we are given small bits and pieces, a few attacks, there is footage found online of some shaky cell phone video, etc. but the city and the main characters, for the most part, have no real comprehension of what is going on until it is far too late. The author slips from one character to the next with relative ease, pacing the story through their eyes, and in particular, through Mike, a journalist's eyes, who is telling us his story in first person. The other stories, about Lester, a drug dealer caught inside the neighborhood that is originally cordoned off, Kate, a serial killer who is just getting warmed up, and Grinder, the lead singer of a heavy metal band, are all told in third person. Tim does an excellent job of getting us up to speed on all his character's lives and how they act and react to everything going on around them. I found it particularly interesting that the only person we are given first person exposure to is the journalist and likely the most normal person of the bunch. Mike is dealing with difficult issues but his burgeoning relationship with a co-worker seems a bright spot in a story filled with three other characters who are all, in my humble estimation, disturbed in their own particular ways. It would have been interesting to see the first person perspective of the serial killer, though the insights into her psychy are pretty indepth (I would especially like to see the first person perspective of the \"other\", which drives Kate to do the horrid things she does). When it is finally clear that the deaders are at their full strength and their numbers are growing rapidly, the violence is in your face, visceral, and merciless. The author indiscriminantly throws us into the blender and lets us taste the agony of a city that is dying and coming back to life with the undead. A sequel would be natural and makes complete sense because in many ways, this tale has only just begun. The story is solid and the characters real and fascinating. I kind of figure Tim decided to give us the first person perspective with the more \"normal\" character of the lot. Since these four barely get to interact during the book, it will be interesting if he decides to carry along with a first person view and see what perceptions Mike develops about the drug dealer, the heavy metal lead singer, and the serial killer. The book is excellent and Tim, a first time novelist but someone who has written quite a few other works, definitely has some chops as a writer. My only true criticism is that there are some typos sprinkled throughout the book. Nothing that really detracts from the story but they are noticeable. It certainly did not keep me from enjoying the book a great deal and I am looking forward to picking up the sequel down the road when he gets around to writing it. If you are a fan of zombies or just of apocalyptic fiction in general, this is definitely one to pick up."}, {"userName": "Rhiannon Frater", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1805401-rhiannon-frater", "userReview": "First off, I'm a big fan of Timothy W. Long's work. He submitted a short story to the witches anthology I am editing and I was instantaneously hooked on his writing. I then became a fan of his completely hilarious and gruesome online blog called \u201cThe Zombie-Wilson Diaries.\u201d It has been snatched up for publication by the Library of the Living Dead Press and I am thrilled to be the editor.But despite my great love for Timothy Long\u2019s work, I had yet to read \u201cAmong the Living.\u201d When I found out I would be editing \u201cThe Zombie-Wilson Diaries,\u201d I decided to order the book and add it to my huge stack of \u201cto read\u201d novels.This last week I dove into the book and I have to say I really enjoyed it. Tim has a unique way of writing that is very fresh and entertaining. Humor mixes easily with horror as he weaves a story about four very different people living in a city that is slowly sliding into chaos. The characters and their relationships come across as realistic and you find yourself being drawn into their world. Even though a few of the characters were not the best humankind has to offer, I found myself caring about their fate as the tension ratcheted up and the undead (or deaders) became more of a threat.Though there are four \u201cmajor\u201d characters, their time at center stage varies greatly. In fact, a \u201cminor\u201d character, named Alice, had me utterly wrapped up in her fate, whereas one of the major characters, Grinder, could have disappeared out of the story completely and I wouldn\u2019t have missed him. His time at the center of the story was very limited and did not give me enough time for me to actually care about whether he lived or died.Lester, the drug dealer, and his girlfriend are a strong presence in the book and their sections are very suspenseful and frightening. Kate, the serial killer, is interesting, but really doesn\u2019t have much to do other than off a victim then spend a lot of time talking to her neighbor, Bob. It is not until the end that she really comes into her own. Mike, our first person narrator (the others are written in third), has a tragic past and his budding relationship with a co-worker is very well-done. They really don\u2019t do much until the very end, but by then, I was so emotionally invested in their relationship, I was on pins and needles as they tried to escape the hordes of zombies.This is definitely a solid four stars. I wish I could give it more, but I felt the uneven distribution of time among the characters weakened their impact on the overall storyline. I really loved the entire overall plot, the slow buildup of tension until the city explodes in mayhem, the characterization as a whole, and the gory, action-packed scenes toward the end. This is a good, solid zombie book and I highly recommend it.That being said, the best Timothy Long writing has yet to be revealed when \u201cThe Zombie-Wilson Diaries\u201d is released in the near future. I may be a little biased in my review because I know this writer hits his full stride in that novel.One last note: the editing is not what it should be, but it does not deter from the story one iota.In short, BUY THIS BOOK! You won\u2019t regret it."}, {"userName": "Starla B", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4723546-starla-b", "userReview": "This story was gory, disgusting and terrifying, everything a zombie novel should be. I loved it! The descriptions painted a very vivid picture. I'll have nightmares for weeks, but I can't wait until the next installment comes out! A number of reviewers seem to have issues with the grammar and spelling. I can't say I really noticed the errors as I was reading, but I might be more forgiving than some readers. If you are someone who is offended by those type of errors, this might not be the book (or version) for you. Other reviews also talk about some of the unnecessary characters that don't add to the plot. Since this is the first in a series, I believe those characters will become important in the following books. They appeared in this book to provide their background as the events were happening. Yes, most of the characters are horrible people. Sometimes I felt the zombies were more sympathetic and easier to relate to than the live characters. However, I look forward to seeing those characters' personal growth in future installments."}, {"userName": "Toni", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13706669-toni", "userReview": "This review is also on My Book Addiction as part of #zOctober2013! Holy. Crap. Among the Living is all kinds of mess-you-up-in-the-head goodness! This story is strange and wonderful, and I couldn\u2019t stop reading it.This is a story about the first days of the apocalypse. The residents of Seattle are informed of a \u201cgas leak,\u201d an obvious cover up to keep people from panicking. The scenario is presented from several different POV\u2019s, all very interesting and peculiar characters that took me by surprise. I mean, Lester\u2019s girlfriend sends him away from the safety of their apartment to nab a designer bag from their friend, who is now a walking corpse with a really expensive purse! Who does that? Lester and his girlfriend had me laughing and made me tense at the same time. An odd combination of feelings, indeed.Mike, a journalist with a troubled past and a slow-growing fondness for his co-worker is the only character that comes at you from a first person viewpoint. I really enjoy first person narration when it\u2019s done well, as it pulls me deeper into the story. It\u2019s like having a friend tell you their story. I felt the biggest connection to Mike and Erin, and was chewing at my lip with anxiety as they tried to escape the undead. The rest of the characters are presented in third person \u2014 Lester and his crazy girlfriend, Kate the serial killer, and Grinder the lead singer. While I found each character fascinating in their own way, even some of the minor characters, it was Mike\u2019s tale I longed to read the most. This story is dark, twisted and full of \u201cDid that really just happen?\u201d moments.Among the Living is a must read for all fans of horror and zombies! I will definitely be picking up more by this author. I highly recommend this book to folks with thick skin, and not just to avoid becoming infected. There are certain aspects of the story which have the potential to be offensive to more sensitive folks.

The apocalypse unfolds nicely, as word of a \"gas leak\" and a government coverup. Totally believable even if you get a little frustrated with the refusal of many to believe it. The main heroes are explored very well- with the exception of Ginder- who is absolutely useless to the whole plot. Mike, who has suffered his own loss of his young son some year prior, adds a component of loss before the really loss starts. Kate is an interesting character as a serial killer with a somewhat dissociative identity due to abuse as a child. Even Lester, the pothead drug dealer is a character you may root for, who for once in his life, it forced to get up and fight. Even short excepts of characters who are about to become deaders are interesting, but I still wanted more. I wanted to feel the loss of certain characters who were central to the story along the way, and it seemed with their lack of definition they were already dead."}, {"userName": "Ray", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10472011-ray", "userReview": "Imagine a world crammed tight to its undead gills with lifeless souls who would happily feast upon your brains.. actually scrub that - we're already there right?So anyways, Among The Living by Timothy Long is that rarest of gems in the sea of Zombie fiction in that it's excellent.I wont give any spoilers here other than to say Timothy has breathed depth and life into the stars of his novel.

They're about to have a front row seat for the end of the world. These Seattle residents are all going about their lives as usual when a strange new virus outbreak hits, causing painful death, instant reanimation and an insatiable hunger for human flesh and blood to all who come in contact with it. In Timothy Long's Among the Living, we get a somewhat different take on the traditional zombie tale.Zombie 411 - While I don't think the term \"zombie\" was ever uttered in this book, Among the Living is undeniably a zombie novel. The zombies start as the typical Romero-style shamblers but soon become the 28 Days Later-style sprinters.The good - Although I question the amount of character development in this book, especially given the short life spans, I have to say Long did a good job coming up with interesting, (mostly) realistic characters. You get to know an awful lot about the main characters in particular that by the end doesn't seem all that relevant. Perhaps he was aiming for a sequel that would bring their back stories into play? The action sequences were also handled well. They were tense, cinematic, and essentially what kept me turning the pages.The not so good - I know it's pretty standard in these kinds of books, but I had an issue with the first person narration, especially since the \"main\" character really didn't get much more time than the other principals, who were narrated in the third person. It affected the flow of the story. Some of the dialogue was over the top as well. No matter how clever a phrase may be, I need to believe it's something a human being might actually say to another person, and that wasn't always the case here. My other issue is with the way the book ended. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I'll just say that it stretched believability, even by zombie novel standards.It's clear that Long had a lot of ideas - most of them very interesting - going into this book, and even though they don't always come together perfectly, Among the Living is a solid-enough zombie novel that's not your usual \"lone survivor\" type story. It's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the genre, especially if you can grab the kindle version on sale."}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7620827-tracy", "userReview": "It's obvious Long can write but chose not to for much of this. There are major problems with tense (which sometimes changes twice in a single sentence), pronoun usage that makes it confusing who he's referring to, and overuse of tired phrases. That's all stuff that could be fixed with an editing pass, but it wouldn't matter because of the book's bigger problems.Each chapter follows a particular character, and all of the chapters for one of the characters are written in first person, while chapters for the other characters are written in third person. There's no reason for it, and it is jarring while adding nothing. Worse, the voice switches to second person at a few points in a vain attempt to make you feel like you're a zombie. It all smacks of a writer showing off instead of getting out of the way of the story.Even that wouldn't matter if the characters were compelling, but few are (and one has no reason to be included at all). Or if the reaction to the outbreak was remotely plausible, but it isn't. Or if Seattle was described in enough detail that people who don't live there would understand any of the settings, but only the barest of details are provided (sometimes just a name). Long seems to conserve all his descriptive powers for sex scenes and detailed reports about flesh, wounded or otherwise.Combine all that with an absurd ending to set up a sequel, and you end up with a regrettable read. It's sad, because there are sections here that prove Long has the chops to do much better work."}, {"userName": "Dawn Peers", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1967886-dawn-peers", "userReview": "Among the Living is a US-based horror story, set in Seattle. This is a review of the unabridged audio version of the book.I *really* liked this work. Set in first and third person perspectives and showing us the lives of four different protagonists, it gives us a glimpse in to their lives and personalities (mostly) before the outbreak sets in. The characters are very different people, and the building-work for each of them is dealt with effectively by Long. I found myself disliking two of them immensely at the start, then feeling sorry for one, and hating the other even more, whilst wanting to shake one of the good ones on the shoulders going \"DEAR GOD SNAP OUT OF IT!\"So yeah, you might say I got a fair bit out of this book.This is character-driven and turn-based action. My kind of zombie book, the monsters play second fiddle, and are a supporting actor to the way humanity respond to catastrophic events. I felt this was very real in its portrayal of how mankind would actually respond - a panicky cover-up gone bad, delayed realisation followed by that moment where everyone in charge probably realises \"whoops, could have done that better\".The monsters themselves, whilst supporting actors they may be, are described with grisly aplomb. I liked the interlude stories as well, from tertiary characters and how they felt as the virus began to infect them.I'll certainly be hunting more out from Mr Long.

If you are from or familiar with Seattle and the surrounding area it definitely enhances the quality of this read.I listened to it as an audio book, which seems to be a good thing. Reading some other reviews there was a lot of writing quirks that I didn't notice too much as an audio book. I'm not sure if this is Long's first novel, but it has that feeling of an early book that isn't all that great but where you can see that a few books down the road the author is going to be pretty good.The four narratives were hard to follow at times which detracted from the story early on. Later on in the book as the four narratives drew closer in location and situation there was some definite pay off, and it seems like a strong set up for the sequel which I plan on starting right away. Some of the characters were really hard to like. The metal head and the douche drug dealer were both characters that were believable but so far removed from people I would happily have in my life I found there stories at time painful to read.

However, I find it so refreshing to have anti-heroes. I think too many books, about post apocalyptic life, are filled with survivors that are morally superior. In reality, we would have a wider variety of survivors, if not a larger number of street-smart, morally ambiguous people. I loved the rawness of Kate and Lester...despite the fact that they are written as the dregs of society.If anything, the more moral the character...the more they seemed to want to deny the events transpiring.I'm not usually a huge fan of 1st person POV, but it really worked here. I have also read reviews that dislike the objectification of women. But, these were true to the inner thoughts of the characters (1st person). I ended up appreciating the honesty of it.This story falls short in some areas, but the characterization makes up for it. There is no substitution for a bad-ass with swords.

The four main characters are very different from each other (see book description above for most of their details) and their viewpoints of the outbreak and how they handle the emotional aspects of it are very interesting. The story is told in third person with three of the characters, but changes to first person with Mike for some reason. I'm not sure why this is, and it does take a little to get used to when reading it, but it's not too annoying. The style of writing in the first half of the book reminded me quite a bit of Richard Laymon, which the thirteen year old boy inside of me still loves. There is quite a lot of description of women's anatomy and weird sex scenes, but once the author gets that out of the way it turns into a very intense, and somewhat emotional tale.

A lot of the ZBooks I read are already in the panic of the spread or take place once it has been in effect for weeks. Starting at the beginning and staying there made this book refreshing to me. I found this book to be well written and very entertaining. It is a fast read. Lots of action in it with some romance, sex, (some graphic), definitely violence. As stated there is alcohol and weed use. Adult language too.A full review can be found on www.alaskanbookcafe.com"}, {"userName": "Badseedgirl", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20662786-badseedgirl", "userReview": "This novel was ok. It was typical of the lower end of the zombie sub-genre. The scenes of the zombie attacks had the right amount of gore, but I do not care for soft-core porn, and there was to much of this. I think the story line of how a serial killer would do in a zombie apocalypse is a new and refreshing idea. But Mr. Long, you cheapened it by making Kate a sexual sadomasochist with \"Daddy issues\". Why couldn't she just be a killer, why did she have to have the broken little girl back story. Mr. Long, you never would have given a male serial killer this kind of back story. It strikes of misogyny. Shame on you!"}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6118120-william", "userReview": "This book was full of blood, guts, gore, and zombies. Which was was TOTALLY AWESOME!!!! This is a great novel about a zombie virus outbreak in Seattle WA. It has strong characters which you begin to pull for, from the beginning. Even a drug dealer named Lester, and his girlfriend Angela, become likable & make you hope that they will get away from the deaders and find safety. Each page made you sit on edge with anticipation of a deader coming out of nowhere and biting one of the main characters. I would highly recommend this book for my fellow zombie lovers."}, {"userName": "Steve Wands", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5282827-steve-wands", "userReview": "Among The Living, for me, was slow to start. There's a lot of characters, and each one is developed well. You really get a good feel for who these people are and what drives them. All the while the world is going to hell around them. What initially seemed slow starts to build up speed and before I knew it I was clicking away to the end of the book and wanting more. There is a lot to like here, and if you love zombie books the way I do, then you'll find a lot to love here. I just hope Kate is in the sequel."}, {"userName": "Camille", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/249544-camille", "userReview": "Ups and downsI considered giving up on this one. It felt a little slow (true zombie action doesn't start until about 85% in.) The characters were completely whacked. But they were interesting and I was curious to see how it would play out. The author did a really good job of making the characters seem real. They each had a distinct voice. I'm undecided if I will read the next one. I like how this focuses on one city rather than the whole world being wiped out in a week. But I worry that the next one will start out just as slowly. Plus the deaths at the end made me sad."}, {"userName": "Drew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7983972-drew", "userReview": "\u2018Among the Living\u2019 takes a bit to get going, but when it does it offers a fun ride as the Zombie apocalypse begins. I\u2019ve always had a little bit of a problem with the zombie apocalypse just happening too fast, which is why this book was so likable. People go about their daily lives knowing something is happening but not sure what until finally the zombie population has really started to grow and is finally noticed for the problem it is. Not for the faint of heart this book takes you into the head of survivor and zombie providing a nice thrill ride."}, {"userName": "Christine Collado-acebal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5908188-christine-collado-acebal", "userReview": "The story itself had potential, but it seemed like the character development and individual stories were rushed. I, unfortunately, bought the Kindle version which was devoid of editing and had pages or ends of sentences missing. I will read the second book in the series only because it earned better reviews and I would like to see how the rest of the characters/story develops. I hope I am not just being a glutton for punishment...we'll see..."}], "description": "The dead walk. Now the real battle for Seattle has begun.
