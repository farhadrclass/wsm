We have done over half of the activities and experiments in this book. The supplies are things that are often just things around the house, so req little prep and no extra cost. This was a life saver this past winter when we had snow days galore and the kids were bored. I highly recommend this book, it keeps the kids busy, it's educational and fun too!"}, {"userName": "Cameron", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7356017-cameron", "userReview": "It tells you how to make lots of things and it has lots of colours."}, {"userName": "Janin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5214227-janin", "userReview": "My boys and I have enjoyed trying out several of these experiments.
