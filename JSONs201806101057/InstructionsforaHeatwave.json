Like, sit in the bathtub until you're a prune good. Miss your stop on the train good. Refuse to split the driving time on a weekend road trip good. I may or may not have done all of these things while reading this book. In all honesty, this is a pretty standard Family in Crisis novel. The basic plot is a rather familiar one: husband leaves one day and doesn't come home, mother requests the presence of her far-flung adult children who are each so burdened with their own little dramas that their relationships with each other have disintegrated. O'Farrell has set her version of these events in the midst of the 1976 heatwave that sent London into a drought, at a time when the Irish were still viewed suspiciously and traditional values clashed with modern attitudes in the worst way. Gretta is the mother with a larger than life presence that her children find more embarrassing than anything. Michael Francis, the eldest, is struggling to keep his marriage together despite his resentment that is has cost him all of his professional aspirations. Monica, the favorite, lost her first marriage to an ill-kept secret and now feels beleaguered by how much her second husband's daughters resent her. Aiofe, the baby, has run off to New York after a falling out with Monica and struggles to hide the fact that she can not read. Robert, the absent father, has long used his bookish nature and difficult war experiences as an excuse to avoid discussing his equally difficult personal history.So I saw Jami Attenburg speak at the Gaithersburg Book Festival earlier this spring, and she mentioned that she had been asked to blurb this book. It's her blurb that ultimately sums up the best thing about this book: \"It's just the kind of family drama I love: Nobody gets off easy in it, but everybody gets treated with compassion.\u201dI love, love, loved these characters. They're complicated and flawed, but entirely realistic and deserving of empathy. Each character made me - in equal parts - root for them and exclaim, \"What the fuck, dude?\" They were so, so human. Then there's the fact that O'Farrell could write the face off just about anyone else currently sitting pretty in the new release bins. I've read a long string of \"meh\" books over the last few months and I was long overdue for a book that I could not put down. Her prose just rolled around in my head and I didn't want it to stop. I was impressed by the way that she laid out tiny little ironies -- the illiterate character with the name no one can properly pronounce -- just waiting to be picked apart and mined for meaning, yet never so in your face that I wanted to pat her on the head and say, \"We get it, sweetie.\"My one complaint, the only thing that I can see being a problem for other folks, is that it feels as though O'Farrell rushed through the ending in order to tie every loose thread up but didn't quite address everything. I got to the end and I wanted...just a little more. The bows she tied everything up with were a little too vague. Regardless, this book is fantastic, exactly what I needed."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "A solid, gripping family saga. A thoroughly enjoyable read. One of those books that makes living a joy. Packed with back story and intrigue. THE BLURBThe stunning new novel from Costa Award winning novelist Maggie O'Farrell: a portrait of an Irish family in crisis in the legendary heatwave of 1976. It's July 1976. In London, it hasn't rained for months, gardens are filled with aphids, water comes from a standpipe, and Robert Riordan tells his wife Gretta that he's going round the corner to buy a newspaper. He doesn't come back. The search for Robert brings Gretta's children \u2014 two estranged sisters and a brother on the brink of divorce \u2014 back home, each with different ideas as to where their father might have gone. None of them suspects that their mother might have an explanation that even now she cannot share. Maggie O'Farrell's sixth book is the work of an outstanding novelist at the height of her powers.I needed this novel right now. I will read this author again."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "My rating: 2 of 5 starsA copy of Instructions for a Heatwave was provided to me by Knopf for review purposes.'Odd that your life can contain such significant tripwires to your future and, even while you wander through them, you have no idea.'The story itself starts off at a slow and leisurely pace that doesn't ever quite pick up speed but the writing itself was quite gripping. The characters are also very drab and almost boring but they're written so well that they somehow manage to be intriguing nonetheless. The three grown-up children (of the missing father) are the center of the story despite the fact that it was their father that went missing, their father that was initially the reason for this story. Him going missing was simply the catalyst to bringing these three children back together after many years of separation.As the story progressed I became less and less interested in why their father disappeared and even with the odd assortment of drama every character managed to possess. The ongoing family drama seemed more stereotypical than interesting and while the characters themselves may have been intriguing at first That certainly didn't last. You know those characters in stories that make idiotic choices or choose to withhold some vital information and you can't help but scream, \"Just TELL SOMEONE\" yet they don't and it just produces more drama and continues to cause problems? Well, that happened. And it was ridiculous and failed to garner any sympathy from me. Also, the ending was completely preposterous and was actually quite laughable. Hint: Your questions will likely not be answered. Simply put, this \"sweeping family drama\" only managed to be mediocre due to the lackluster cast of characters and their completely avoidable drama. Yet another highly anticipated summer read that failed to meet any of my expectations."}, {"userName": "PattyMacDotComma", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma", "userReview": "4.5\u2605First. Before anything else. Thank you Maggie O\u2019Farrell for this (and you\u2019re welcome, anyone else like me who has never got this right either):\n\u201c \u2018Mum,\u2019 Aoife says again. \u2018It\u2019s me.\u2019\u2018Aoife?\u2019It strikes Aoife in that moment that her mother is the only one who can properly pronounce her name. The only person in whose mouth it sounds as it should. Her accent\u2014still unmistakably Galway, after all these years\u2014strikes the first syllable with a sound that is halfway between \nE\n and\n A\n, and the second with a mysterious blend of \nV\n and \nF\n. She drives the name precisely between both \u2018Ava\u2019 and \u2018Eva\u2019 and \u2018Eve\u2019, passing all three but never colliding with them. Aoife, she says, exactly and like no one else.\u201d\nDisclaimer: I am predisposed to like Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s stories. They are inhabited by real people, haunted by their pasts and their upbringings. They may not know, if you asked them, what\u2019s wrong, why are you the way you are, but O\u2019Farrell knows and shows us. Each member of this family has their own story as well as their shared story. A man arriving home, quietly lamenting his all-too-short bachelorhood, finds his little kids waiting for dinner but nothing\u2019s ready. Again. Then, up comes his little girl \n\u201cknocking her curly head into his thigh, like a little goat . . . He is, again and for a moment, completely the person he is meant to be: a man, in his kitchen, lifting his daughter into the air. . . He is filled with\u2014what? Something more than love, more than affection. Something so keen and elemental it resembles animal instinct. For a moment, he thinks that the only way to express this feeling is cannibalism. Yes, he wants to eat his daughter, starting at the creases in her neck, moving down to the smooth pearlescent skin of her arms.\u201d\nWhat parent hasn\u2019t said to a small child, I could just gobble you up? But O\u2019Farrell says it better. This book is about what happens when this man gets a phone call that his mother is home alone and frightened because his father has disappeared. Michael Francis, Monica, and Aoife all return home from their own precarious lives to attend to their difficult, demanding mother, who has been lonely for years as an unwelcome Irish woman in England. (Yesterday\u2019s refugees.)Michael Francis lives nearby, his dreams of being a professor in America abandoned because \n\u201cHe\u2019s gone and knocked up a Prod\u201d\n as Aoife so delicately put it. While their Irish Catholic background colours the story, it isn\u2019t the whole story.Monica is divorced (oh the shame of it) and living with a new partner and his kids. She doesn\u2019t want kids \u2013 she was nine when her mother had a difficult pregnancy with Aoife, and then Aoife was a noisy, crying, complaining, fractious baby whom only Monica could manage. So manage she did. For years. Forever, it seems. And she's told Aoife this.Aoife never coped with school, never learned to read, and has fled to New York where she works for a photographer and is falling for a nice guy who\u2019s hiding from the draft. She has hidden her disability, but it\u2019s kept her on edge, always. She is cut from a different cloth, and an interesting one it is, too.These are Gretta\u2019s troubled children, who have come home to investigate their father\u2019s disappearance, but who are out at the moment, so the house is empty. I completely relate to this:\n\u201cIt\u2019s this kind of emptiness she likes\u2014signs of people around, their discarded possessions left as a reassurance of their return. Monica\u2019s jacket on a hanger, Michael Francis\u2019s car key on the hall table, that scarf of Aoife\u2019s draped over a peg.\u201d\nEngland is in drought, suffering a heatwave, and the heat permeates every movement of this family as they look for clues to find their father. Each resents being there, and they fall back into their old patterns of parent/sibling bickering (as we do). Each thinks he or she has more troubles than anyone, until a family bombshell is dropped late in the story.The first half of the book moves very slowly \u2013 the heat, perhaps? \u2013 as we learn about the characters. And I did get frustrated for a while. Still, I\u2019ll be left thinking about these people for a long time, I suspect."}, {"userName": "S.A.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4720883-s-a", "userReview": "This book dithers like an elderly woman pondering what flavor of Cesar dog food to feed to her spoiled schnauzer. It dithers like my last rambling sentence.The main reason I finished reading the novel was to see if anything mind-blowing actually happened. Hell, I would have settled for nose-blowing or blink-inducing. To me, the huge secret that matriarch Gretta Riordan held back from her children had the strength of a butterfly burp. Perhaps its a culture thing and I'm out of the loop. But to me, Mammy Gretta is pretty much a domestic monster. It's a wonder her adult children still speak to her. The characters all deserved to be hit in the head by a shovel at one time or another. If I was related to these people, I'd disown them in a blink. Once in a while I'd experience a flash of sympathy for their largely self-created plights, but the flashes died quick deaths. Mostly I reached for the shovel.Well, I need to backtrack to one character: Aoife, the youngest of the three Riordan siblings and the only one who had the sense to run away from her family. Aoife put the Atlantic ocean between her and her family. She's one of the reasons I finished the book. I just hoped to hell she would tell SOMEONE about her serious problem and get help. Then again, here I also blame Gretta, the domestic monster, for not helping her difficult child move past her learning disability. At least Aoife's story does have resolution. In short, the writing was engaging. For me, aside from Aoife, the impossible, selfish characters and dreary storyline dragged down the novel."}, {"userName": "Chari", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60819348-chari", "userReview": "4.5 \u2729 Que bonita historia de nuevo sobre los miembros de una familia, me ha gustado mucho.

Into that too real situation in London recently retired Robert Riordan, formally of Ireland, tells his wife Gretta he is going to buy a paper. When he does not come back Gretta calls together their adult children consisting of Michael Francis, and Monica and Aoife who is in New York.

When some of those secrets come out as secrets tend to do, they cause a lot of heartache, anger and upheaval.I thought all the characters were well portrayed, even though I never particularly warmed to any them. They are all complex characters. The settings and times are also well conveyed. It gave a great picture of a family dealing with a lot of issues and it was interesting to look at the way siblings relate to each other. I found it an extremely involving novel and enjoyed it, although I had some reservations about the way it ended."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665521-sarah", "userReview": "I absolutely loved The Hand That First Held Mine when I read it a couple of years ago. The weaving of stories, the secrets and slow revelations were all so beautifully done. It is a compelling read. So, I absolutely jumped at the chance of a review copy of the new novel from the lovely folk at Tinder Press. I didn't read it straight away, but once I saw all the amazing comments from people that had, I knew it was time to dive in. I read it, and enjoyed it, but didn't immediately connect with it in the same way as I had with her previous work. I admit to being very perplexed; I felt like I'd missed something. Other book bloggers who I trust and admire were raving about it, so I decided to mull it over for a while and come back to it nearer publication. I waited for a friend of mine to read her copy, then had a chat about it - and that's when it all started to fall into place for me.There is so much more going on in Instructions for a Heatwave than I'd allowed for. I'd got into my story-mode of reading, when I'm all about the 'what's happening' without allowing for any reflection about the characters or even really thinking about the social context. I feel I owe the book a big apology, because it is actually marvellous.First of all, the writing itself is brilliant. The way language is used to create the oppressive atmosphere of the summer is perfect: Gretta moves through the house with the solid air weighing upon her back. Hot and cold are used to describe people and their moods; one person can be coolly indifferent, another suffers slow-burning panic. Their conversations with each other are full of false starts and half truths, skirting the issue and flares of temper. Like families do. They bicker and backbite, reliving old grievances and replaying their allotted roles. But, and here's the crucial thing, these relationships can be altered. Old wounds can be healed, friendships can be renewed.The secrets that come to light, gradually, throughout the book are not so very shocking now, but in their own context do have an impact. Everyone in the family is harbouring guilt over things they would rather not reveal. Robert's disappearance is the catalyst for all the careful concealment to be undone. It seems to me that the whole family are suffocating with the amount of things unsaid between them - this atmosphere is brilliantly created and as a reader I felt it too. I wanted to know all of the things, and if the Riordans refused to be honest with each other, I was prepared to give them all a stern talking to.If I can have one complaint, it's that I wanted to know more about the characters. Gretta's life as a young wife and mother in a new country; Robert's thoughts on retirement; Michael Francis' marriage; Aoife's decision to leave. And Monica. Most of all I wanted to know more about Monica. How did she end up in such a rubbish marriage, with a ready-made family she never wanted. Of all of them I felt she could do with a friend the most. I've been left with a curiosity about her, and I've realised that she has made quite an impact upon me.As I hope is apparent, I have moved from 'enjoyed' to 'in awe' - I love it when a novel can sneak up on you and make you love it more the more you think about it. Instructions for a Heatwave is is a wonderful read."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/402584-teresa", "userReview": "For an avid reader nothing quite compares with that thrill you get when you open the pages of a favourite writer's latest novel. Even seeing glowing advance reviews does nothing to temper that underlying apprehension that this one might not tick all the boxes but you would think I'd know by now, 6 novels in, that I can rely on Maggie O'Farrell.Instructions for a Heatwave is mostly set in London in 1976. The city is in the midst of a searing heatwave and \"strange weather brings out strange behaviour\". In the case of the Riordan family, the rising temperatures mirror rising tensions. Secrets which have lain dormant for many years are about to erupt. The catalyst is the sudden, unexplained disappearance of Robert (Ronan) Riordan, retired, respectable, mild-mannered former assistant bank manager. His wife Gretta wavers between playing the martyr and sticking her head in the sand but her now-adult children know something is up. Little by little the skeletons emerge from the closet threatening to destabilise this already fragile family.O'Farrell's writing is searingly honest, acutely insightful and always tempered with a wry sense of humour. Gretta is a joy to read - she has the obstinacy of the Irish Catholic Mammy, determined to protect her children from secular England and wallowing in self-pity when they fall off the rails. Her eldest, Michael Francis, has woes of his own with marital problems which he might have exacerbated. Middle child, Monica, is out in the sticks, trying but failing to be the doting step-mother, \"Peter came with a ready-made family, with spare children, she'd hoped she might slot into their lives almost as if they were her own\".Aoife, the youngest, has somehow managed to conceal her dyslexia from her nearest and dearest but struggles to live life to the full with this secret burden. Every family has its secrets but the Riordans have been particularly adept at keeping them hidden and letting things fester.This is an extremely readable, insightful novel and O'Farrell once more shows her expertise at stripping family dynamics bare, exposing the elephant in the room. The Riordans are ordinary folk but their story is fascinating and it will engage readers from the opening pages. Most certainly a 5 star read."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "Another spot-on tale of family and romantic relationships \u2013 O\u2019Farrell always gets the emotional tenor just right. As with The Hand That First Held Mine, this novel is narrated in the present tense, which I acknowledge can be irksome, but again, here she manages it perfectly; it\u2019s a handy tool for lending a sense of immediacy and reality.You may spot hints of Rachel Joyce\u2019s The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry (a family patriarch goes out for a walk but doesn\u2019t come back), All the Beggars Riding by Lucy Caldwell (family secrets and marriages by another name), and The Reader by Bernhard Schlink (a major character is desperately hiding the fact that she can\u2019t read), but the psychological and linguistic precision is all O\u2019Farrell\u2019s own. Her descriptive language is unfailingly elegant. I love how she opens with the heat as the most notable character: \u201cIt inhabits the house like a guest who has outstayed his welcome: it lies along corridors, it circles around curtains, it lolls heavily on sofas and chairs.\u201d(I had the chance to see Maggie O\u2019Farrell read from this book and answer questions about it in September 2013; my write-up is on Bookkaholic.)"}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "3.5 stars Instructions for a Heatwave by Maggie O Farrell is a very enjoyable and entertaining novel and I was really excited to read this book having loved The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox.The story is set in London in July 1976.

I love the easy way the author draws her characters and she sets the scenes with such ease that you feel you are right there in the story.While I enjoyed the novel I felt the story dragged and while there were twists and turns and surprises they failed to make an impact on the story and just seemed to hang.

I am an only child, as is she, and she said something that struck a chord with me. She talked about how she is fascinated by families and the dynamics between siblings. It seems to her that families are a safe place where you can behave worse than you would in any other facet of your life and somehow it is permissible and you will (eventually) be forgiven. When the sibling dynamic is something that you yourself have not experienced, it is endlessly puzzling and fascinating.I don't know if Maggie O'Farrell is an only child (her biography does not disclose this information), but one of the things that I love about her as a writer is the way she explores families and the complicated relationship between siblings (look no further than The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox). This is another book about family dynamics, with the plot playing almost a secondary role to the relationships between the siblings and their parents.It's set in England in 1976. Robert Riordan tells his wife Gretta that he's going out to buy a newspaper and doesn't come back. The three children return home to support their mother and assist with the search. Michael Francis comes from across town, Monica comes up from London and Aoife (pronounced EE-fah) flies home from New York where she has been living for 8 years. All of the children are dealing with their own issues: marriage problems, long held grudges, tightly held secrets. And Gretta is also nursing her own secrets. Maggie O'Farrell is such a wonderful writer and the characters really come to life.In the afterword, the author explains that she used the setting of the 1976 heatwave because she thinks that aberrant weather brings out erratic behaviour. I am not sure whether this was entirely effective although there is a heightened sense of unreality in Gretta's responses to the situation and maybe the weather was a factor in this. O'Farrell also has a slightly irritating habit of not entirely wrapping her endings up. The reader is left to intuit or guess exactly how things panned out. I didn't particularly mind this, but I can see that some people might find that irritating.I loved this book. I got wrapped up in the characters and I felt that I got to know them all."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3356446-carol", "userReview": "Instructions for a Heatwave by Maggie O'Farrell took me captive! I love her style of writing, her story and her way of capturing an Irish accent. I haven\u2019t read anything by her before so it is good surprise to find another author that I really enjoy.Gretta Riordan is suffering through the London heatwave of 1976 by not using the dishwasher and watering her garden. Her children are grown up and living away but all have troubles of their own. She had been married 40 years and her husband said he was off to get a newspaper. But he didn\u2019t come back.The whole story of this book just starts on Thursday, July 15, 1976 and ends on Sunday, July 18th. I love how that author develops her characters which are Gretta and her three children, Michael Francis, Monica and Aoile (Irish for Eve). She exposes their life situations which seem to be hopeless.Michael Francis thinks his life is nothing like he had expected it and his wife so different from his mother. Will his marriage work out? Monica has \u201ca lot going on\u201d. She is hiding a big secret from her husband. Will she be able cope with her step children? Aoile is the character that I feel in love with. She was a crier when she was born and always seems to be the misfit. She is hiding a secret of her own that almost everything that she does.The mother is a character too, she often talks nonstop and wants everything to be right but of course she has a major secret that she has been hiding from her children and many other people. With five fascinating characters in this story, it cannot fail.

As his three children join their mother in the search for him, secrets are revealed, painful and held on in private festering for much too long. Finally when there's nothing left to reveal, all the wounds are exposed and salve put on the scars, healing can begin.The book rings true on every level and everyone can relate to it on some level. Some is painful and some is humorous just as real life secrets are. As the layers are peeled, the reader is drawn more and more into the story. It's set in Ireland and London in the 1970'a but isn't dated at all. i recommend this book highly."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "\"Strange weather brings strange behavior.\" In Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s latest book, it does indeed. \u201cAs a Bunsen burner applied to a crucible will bring about an exchange of electrons, the division of some compounds and the unification of others, so a heatwave will act upon people. It lays them bare, it wears down their guard.\u201dIt is 1976 and London is in the grip of an historical heatwave. And in the midst of it, Gretta Riordan discovers that her husband of 40 years has gone. Her three adult children \u2013 each in the midst of his or her own personal crisis \u2013 are summoned home to deal with their father\u2019s surprising disappearance. While together for the first time in years, they reach some understanding of who they are and what they need to move forward.The plot itself isn\u2019t unusual. We\u2019ve seen variations of it before: The Gathering by Anne Enright and Lying with the Dead by Michael Mewshaw, to name two recent ones. What is unusual is the meticulous care that Ms. O\u2019Farrell takes in crafting characters that could walk off the pages.These are three adult characters who come alive: Michael Francis, the father who has never reached his full professional potential and now stands in the hailstorm of a failing marriage; Monica, mom\u2019s favorite, whose former marriage was destroyed by a ill-kept secret and who feels like a duck out of water in a current one; and finally, Aoife, the brilliant-but-illiterate \u201cbaby\u201d of the family whose life in New York is built on one big lie.The talent of Maggie O\u2019Farrell is that this never descends into soap opera territory. There are lyrical insights about the intricacies and nuances of marriage, the tenuous thread that holds siblings together, the devastating and long-range power of secrets. I could not stop turning pages.Then why did I withhold the fifth star? Two reasons, really. The first is a too-pat ending that doesn\u2019t live up to the potential of the rest of the book. Life is filled with ambiguity and the ending does not reflect that. But secondly \u2013 and more importantly \u2013 I never got the sense of the grown children\u2019s connection to their father. He was the reason they all traveled home, but the fear and other emotions that are intrinsic to a father\u2019s disappearance never take root. Despite those qualifications, I thought that Instructions for a Heatwave was a most enjoyable book. Yes, it\u2019s the perfect summer read\u2026and the perfect winter read, too."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16077597-matt", "userReview": "posted on July 1 2015; re-posted on Aug. 26 2015.Maybe this Book will help.It's time we change the climate change back, folks!"}, {"userName": "Lorena", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53245651-lorena", "userReview": "Instrucciones para una ola de calor lleg\u00f3 en un momento en que estaba un poco abrumada con mis lecturas pendientes y buscaba algo que me atrapase, esta historia de Maggie O\u00b4Farrell lo ha conseguido a la perfecci\u00f3n, la forma en la que construye unos personajes terriblemente imperfectos, que tejen y a la vez se ven atrapados por la telara\u00f1a de una sofocante vida familiar, la presencia de fantasmas del pasado, de errores y de secretos inconfesables te atrapa totalmente.

It evoked the period so perfectly. All the wonderful expressions from the time that Maggie O\u2019Farrell weaves through this story reminded me of my grandmother. The language was beautiful. The characters were all flawed, but likeable. The four narrative strands are deftly managed, adding so much depth and richness to the story. The thing I loved most about this book was the way the author released new information about characters gradually throughout the book, making me reassess them in a new light each time. This slow release echoed the character of Gretta, the matriarch of the family, so perfectly. Her delightful way of not quite getting to the point had me laughing at times. The loaf of bread being cooked at the start is the perfect symbol for this family. As the heat gets turned up and all their imperfections, frustrations, rivalries, dysfunctional behaviours and secrets get forced out into the open, they slowly get forged into something stronger.I can see why Maggie O\u2019Farrell has won awards.

The country is in the middle of a legendary heatwave, and the drought and mandated water restrictions have everyone on edge. One morning Gretta Riordan's husband, Robert, goes to get his newspaper, just like he does every morning since his retirement. Yet this time he doesn't come back, and he empties out his bank account on the way.Gretta, a loud, emotional woman, has never met a crisis she couldn't wring for dramatic effect. She summons her three adult children\u2014Michael Francis, a frustrated high school teacher who had dreamed of being a professor in America before the responsibility of marriage and children sidelined his ambitions, and who is trying to make sense of his wife's need for her own intellectual independence; Monica, the favorite child, struggling to deal with two stepdaughters who hate her; and Aoife, the baby, who fled to New York to escape her family and the truth about herself, and who is estranged from Monica for reasons she doesn't understand.When the family comes together to understand why Robert left and where he could have gone, they find themselves falling into familiar patterns, and revisiting familiar hurts and resentments. Yet at the same time, they discover some shocking things about their parents' relationship, and about their own problems.This is familiar territory we've seen in other novels, but Maggie O'Farrell draws you into this family and makes you care about them and what is happening to them, even as you may be frustrated with their behavior. As with many novels that focus on family dynamics, Instructions for a Heatwave is as much about the things we don't say to each other, the things we keep hidden or avoid touching on, as it is about the things that are said. These are appealing characters (for the most part) whose lives you get invested in, although it happens quietly and unexpectedly.Because the fact that the book is set during a heatwave in 1976 is almost secondary to the story, there were a few things I found jarring from time to time, because I couldn't understand why they even were issues, and then I remembered when the story was taking place. But my periodic cognitive dissonance didn't affect my enjoyment of the story or O'Farrell's storytelling ability.

This is mentioned by Michael Francis, who, as it turns out, was born in the forties (more of this later). The Troubles are generally acknowledged to have started in 1969 - SEVEN years before the book was set. One gets the impression that Ms O'Farrell kept forgetting this basic fact throughoutWhen told to come home from New York Aoife jumps on a plane and is home the next day. Now, in 2013 this is perfectly possible but, in 1976 trans-Alantic flights equated to many weeks/months wages. How did Aoife, working part time in a nightclub, manage to have such a huge amount of money available to her at such short notice? How did she manage to book the flight so quickly?Talking of Aoife, we are made aware that she is dyslexic to the point of illiteracy... how did she cope with all the forms when emigrating to the States? Back to Michael Francis and Monica - we know that they are 11 and 10 years older than Aoife... we also know that Aoife has been living in the States for three years. Given that Aoife was probably at least 18 when she left London this would make her a minimum of 21 (add the fact that she is working in a nightclub it is difficult to see how she could be any younger). So we know that Michael Francis has to be at least 32 - which would mean he was born in 43/44. And yet his parents didn't meet until AFTER the war. How did they manage to conceive a child a full two to three years before meeting?Lazy, lazy writing on the part of Maggie O'Farrell which detracted from what was not a bad book overall..."}, {"userName": "Chris Witkowski", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5929196-chris-witkowski", "userReview": "It's 1976 and England is experiencing the worst heat wave in decades. Greta Riordan wakes to another stifling July day to discover her husband has disappeared, leaving no hints as to where he might be. She notifies her three children, and they come to her aid, bringing with them all the resentments, hurts, jealousies, and bitterness accumulated from years of living in a family wracked with deep secrets, led by a mother made dotty by crushing disappointments. This is an engaging novel, with sympathetic characters, especially the young Aoife (I never did get the pronunciation of this name), who has managed, astoundingly, to hide her big secret from the world - her inability to read - suffering greatly in the process. The two other sibilings, Michael Francis and Monica, are also given loving treatment by the author. But although the story is wrenching in many ways, there is an odd lack of emotion in the telling, perhaps a reflection on the almost total repression of feelings that was required to grow up in this family. A good friend and fellow reader, Barbara, recently had this to say in her review of Elizabeth Strout's The Burgess Boys : \"Siblings, as one reviewer notes, are not portrayed in novels as often as parents and children. Yet, it's these relationships where so much of one's being is determined, nurtured or hurt.\" Maggie O'Farrell mines this territory thoroughly in this novel."}, {"userName": "Lynda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18723135-lynda", "userReview": "In my view Maggie O'Fattell has written an uneven spread of novels. Her debut novel After You'd Gone was a ta tantalising atmospheric read with Gothic undertones and The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox was a poignant examination of identity and belonging. The rest have worked less well. Instructions for a Heatwave is somewhere in between. The novel uses the great 1976 heatwave as its framework suggesting that great heat makes people react in different ways and draws things hidden into exposure. O Farrell writes about an Irish family living in North London whose lives are shaken up by the disappearance of their father. Though this is well observed it verges on the stereotypical view of disfunctonal guilt ridden Irish families a d becomes irritating in the extreme almost as irritating as Aoife the youngest daughter who suffers from severe dyslexia . I found myself experiencing elements of this as I was compelled to translate in my head Aoife to the English Eve every time it appeared on the page.

In this current book \u2013 Instructions for a Heatwave by Maggie O\u2019Farrell \u2013 after months of no rain and oppressive heat, Robert Riordan tells his wife that he is going to the corner store one morning and then never returns. His departure is the basis for a reluctant reunion of his wife Gretta and their 3 children; Michael Francis, Monica and Aoife. O\u2019Farrell weaves the heaviness of the heat in and around the stories of the Riordan families\u2019 lives; the heat affects them, it affects their ability to think, to make decisions, it makes them tired and lethargic. It\u2019s brilliant really, the way that the heatwave is such a crucial element to the story. You know that if things had been different, if the temperature had been more normal, it\u2019s entirely possible that this story would play out in a completely different way. Instructions for a Heatwave is really the story of a family and its secrets. It\u2019s the story of how you can be closer to someone that anyone else and still not really know anything about them; you can never know the inner depths to a person if they don\u2019t want you to. Everyone in the Riordan family has their secrets and the keeping of those secrets is what has driven them all to this moment, to Robert walking out and a tension between the siblings so thick, you could cut it with a knife.Michael Francis\u2019 marriage is failing; his wife has pretty much clocked out of the marriage as well as being a mother to their two young children. Michael Francis and Claire got pregnant and married too young (in that order). Neither of them are happy, but while Michael Francis is trying his best, Claire has gone back to school, has found new friends and is slowly changing her appearance \u2018The Industrial Revolution and its effects on the middle classes,\u201d she says, turning to face him, putting an arm over her page, and he experiences a dissolving feeling in his abdomen. Part lust, part horror at her short hair. He still hasn\u2019t got used to it, still can\u2019t forgive her for it. He\u2019d come home a few weeks ago and opened the front door, as yet innocent of what had occurred behind it that day, as yet full of trust that his wife was still the person she\u2019d always been.\u201d I could quote this entire page to be honest, it\u2019s a beautiful ode to Michael Francis\u2019 love for Claire personified in his love of her hair; that she has viciously shorn with no regard for her husband. There is a heart wrenching scene a few pages later where Michael Francis is attempting to make dinner while one of his children is constantly asking questions, Claire is leaving and seems reluctant to give Michael Francis any information about where she is going, and the other child is starting to panic about Claire leaving. The scene is complete chaos; I felt stress just reading it. Monica, the middle child, refuses to acknowledge out loud that her life is not perfect. She feels that she has failed at everything that she has ever tried, and never seems to realize that maybe she needs to change herself before things will get better. O\u2019Farrell really hit the mark with Monica and I really identify with her, although I wish I didn\u2019t! She lets her fear of failure, of being less than perfect affect everything in her life and ends up settling for things that don\u2019t make her happy. She is married to a man that she has nothing in common with, a man who has two daughters; daughters that Monica would love to be a mother to, but they won\u2019t let her in and she does all the wrong things to connect with them. Monica\u2019s biggest problem is herself, her self-persecution and her martyr complex. \u2018Homesick: she\u2019s found that it really does make you feel sick, ill, maddened by longing. But by evening, she is always ready, her grief behind her, hidden, like a deformity she must cover up. Hair up. Makeup on. Supper on the range. She will make this work; she will not go back; she will not let on to anyone; she will not show them that she\u2019s been beaten again. Monica with her failed nursing degree, her childlessness, her husband who left her: she won\u2019t be that person. She will live here in this house with its shaky roof, its skirting-boards that scuttle at night, its moth-eaten furniture, its hostile neighbors. She will live here and she will say nothing.\u201dAoife, the youngest, is the child who invites the most sympathy, by far. She is dyslexic in a time when the disease was not understood and definitely not often diagnosed. Aoife was a difficult baby which was the start of her problems. When she started school things just got worse. Her parents and teachers blamed her for not being able to read. No matter what they tried she never got better, but Aoife wasn\u2019t a meek child and when her elders pushed, she pushed back. As soon as she was old enough she left home and pretty much lived as a squatter until leaving for America. Although freer in New York, Aoife still keeps the secret of her illiteracy. Aoife herself does not understand her problem and so is embarrassed by it. She tells no one, not even those closest to her; and lives by memorizing everything that she can or using the age old technique of asking for help after pretending to have lost her glasses. \u2018She feels herself to be cursed, like those people in folktales who are singled out for the random cruelty of some higher being, condemned forever to have a wing instead of an arm or to live underground or to take the form of a reptile. She cannot read. She cannot do the thing that other people find so artlessly easy: to see arrangements of inked shapes on a page and alchemize them into meaning. She can create letters, she can form them with the nib of a pen or the lead of a pencil, but she cannot get them to line up in the right order, in a sequence that anyone else could understand. She can hold words in her head- she hoards them there \u2013 she can spin sentences, paragraphs, whole books in her mind; she can stack up words inside herself but she cannot get these words down her arm through her fingers and out onto a page. She doesn\u2019t know why this is. She suspects that, as a baby, she crossed paths with a sorcerer who was in a bad mood that day and, on seeing her, on passing her pram, decided to suck this magical ability from her, to leave her cast out, washed up on the shores of illiteracy and ignorance, cursed forever.\u2019 I realize that this is a long quote, but I found it very poignant and a perfect description of the isolation that Aoife must feel. She lives her life constantly on the edge of her seat; afraid of being found out, ready to end one life and try to find another. In reading other reviews of this book I have seen criticisms of O\u2019Farrell not getting Aoife to tell anyone of her problem, but I don\u2019t agree with them. Anyone who had lived the childhood that Aoife did, with no one trying to understand the problem, instead just telling her to try harder and Aoife believing herself to be cursed \u2013 of course she feels like she can\u2019t tell anyone. Who would support or believe her? No one has before. I feel for Aoife, desperately. Reading is my solace, it\u2019s my happy place, my calm place; and not having that in my life is possibly one of the most terrifying things that I can imagine. Robert\u2019s disappearance is not the point of this story; it\u2019s really just the catalyst for the siblings being reunited and a chance to come back together after years of separation. Families are complicated but when it comes down to it, blood is thicker than water. You may keep secrets from them, but they rarely remain hidden forever. And in the end no is closer to you than your family and no one else can understand where you come from. I am not sure where Robert has gone, or why. There seems to be a secret that Gretta may be keeping, she does not seem to be freaking out about his disappearance, but is more concerned about her children. Monic and Aoife have been divided by another secret for years but maybe this is their chance to put the past behind them. Either way, I am looking forward to finishing this book. The characters are all completely defined and unique; I am invested in all of their lives and really hope at least one of them gets out happy."}, {"userName": "Katheryn Thompson", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32687708-katheryn-thompson", "userReview": "It's July 1976, London, and the heatwave gripping the country is the least of Gretta Riordan's problems when her husband leaves the house to buy a newspaper and doesn't come back.

Instructions for a Heatwave finds her at the top of her game, with a novel about a family crisis set during the legendary British heatwave of 1976.

Gretta's three grown children converge on their parents' home for the first time in years: Michael Francis, a history teacher whose marriage is failing; Monica, with two stepdaughters who despise her and a blighted past that has driven away the younger sister she once adored; and Aoife, the youngest, now living in Manhattan, a smart, immensely resourceful young woman who has arranged her entire life to conceal a devastating secret. Maggie O'Farrell writes with exceptional grace and sensitivity about marriage, about the mysteries that inhere within families, and the fault lines over which we build our lives\u2014the secrets we hide from the people who know and love us best.
