A woman has already planned her own funeral, but when she is found dead six hours after she finalizes the arrangements, it has the police wondering if she planned her own death, too? An extremely private, private detective, Daniel Hawthorne, is skilled at solving crimes by blowing up secrets and has a wealth of secrets of his own. And somehow, (this is in the synopsis, so not a spoiler!), the author is drawn into the story as well! The back and forth between Hawthorne and Horowitz was shrewd and witty and brought the whole story together for me. The Word is Murder reminded me of the game of Clue. Growing up, my poor parents and brother had to indulge me in endless games of Clue because my analytical nature was drawn to it. In the same way, I had the best time putting the intricate pieces together to try to solve this crime, and I was absorbed in every second of it! Bravo, Anthony Horowitz! You know how to play your cards! Thank you to Anthony Horowitz, Harper/Harper Collins, and Edelweiss for the ARC. The Word is Murder will be released on June 5, 2018.

Author Anthony Horowitz has shown that he is adept at writing many different genres of books, but it is clear that he was certainly meant to be writing anything but this particular novel. For, you see, Mr Horowitz himself is very much the narrator of this novel and he tells the story as it happens; which is a clever literary device and throws the reader immediately into the action.In his varied career, we learn that Anthony Horowitz has written many television scripts and one of the advisors he consulted was a former detective inspector with the Met; a murder specialist, since thrown out of the force, named Hawthorne. Hawthorne is something of a throwback, with his shabby suits, secretive air and unpleasant prejudices. However, he also does consulting on unusual cases and he asks the author to accompany him on his most recent investigation and write a book about him.Horowitz should be concentrating on a script he needs to show to Stephen Spielberg and Peter Jackson (the scene involving these two men is worth reading the book for alone), plus he has other projects clamouring for his attention. Still, he finds himself drawn into the strange murder of Diana Cowper. A widow in her sixties, Diana Cowper planned her own funeral before being murdered only six hours later. Mother to famous actor, Damian Cowper, involved with the theatre herself, wealthy and well connected, it seems too much of a coincidence that she walked into a funeral parlour to discuss her own burial on the day she was killed. Hawthorne and Horowitz immediately begin to investigate her life; including a tragedy she was involved in nearly ten years previously.This is a wonderfully unusual crime novel. Horowitz\u2019s voice is ever present in this book, as he bemoans the fact that Hawthorne is calling all the shots, yet begrudgingly admires the fact that he always seems able to uncover the secrets beneath the facts. There is an intriguing plot, lots of twists, some wonderful characters and Hawthorne himself, who I would love to see in another book. For, although Horowitz spends much of this book worrying about whether anyone will read this, he needn\u2019t have been concerned. If I loved Horowitz\u2019s previous crime novel, I have to say that I adored this. I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, for review."}, {"userName": "Tammy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50603889-tammy", "userReview": "Cleverly meta and cool! Horowitz writes himself into his own novel which is the cleverly meta part. It\u2019s cool because he references his career as the creator of Foyle\u2019s War, the original adapter of Midsomer Murders and as the author of the teen series, Alex Rider. This mystery is deceptive, devious and revels in devilish games. The author had to have had a ball when writing this.

It is a long term reader\u2019s dream novel almost quite literally. In this case Mr Horowitz does just that, telling his own (?!?) story, getting sucked into a murder mystery of the classic locked room type with a modern twist and keeping us all guessing all the way through.Quirky and extraordinarily readable, The Word Is Murder has an ironic, indelible tone that sucks you straight in \u2013 alongside little gloriously entertaining commentary on the authors real life, we also have Hawthorne (the Sherlock Holmes of this story) with his throwback personality, his acerbic witty asides and his intelligent mind, alternatively dazzling and frustrating Mr Horowitz as he tries to write a book he has no control over.The mystery itself is gloriously twisty with proper clues and proper red herrings \u2013 in a way it feels like a homage to those crime stories of old, but now in a very modern setting \u2013 it is endlessly charming and utterly engrossing, I devoured it with all the fervour of the religiously converted.Loved it. Delightful, funny and completely alive on the page The Word Is Murder is a distinctive, unforgettable novel with a huge touch of class.Highly Recommended."}, {"userName": "Tucker", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39633342-tucker", "userReview": "I hope \u201cThe Word is Murder\u201d was as much fun for Anthony Horowitz to write as it was to read. I was not familiar with Horowitz until I read \u201cMagpie Murders\u201d last year and was totally captivated by his reinvention of an Agatha Christie style mystery. In the \u201dThe Word is Murder,\u201d Horowitz reimagines a Holmes and Watson mystery, with a fictionalized version of Horowitz as Watson. I\u2019ve read novels where authors inserted themselves as characters in their books, but the manner in which Horowitz does so is clever and entertaining. Many of the details about Horowitz in the book are based on his actual life and career. And he\u2019s not the only character with some basis in fact. Part of the fun of the book was trying to guess what actual famous person or persons Horowitz had in mind when he created various characters. While the characters were a significant part of the enjoyment I had from this novel, the mystery was top-notch and ingeniously written. I think I\u2019m a fairly astute and observant reader, so I was convinced at different points throughout the book that I knew who the murderer was. And it wasn\u2019t until the very end of the book that I realized how wrong my previous identifications were. \u201cThe Word is Murder\u201d was a delight from start to finish and I was thrilled to learn that it's not a stand-alone but the first book in a series.

It will not be my last as its clever writing, easy style and the ability to draw one into the story line is quite alluring. Most alluring is the fact that the author himself is one of the main protagonists. and his being so made this book just plain fun. True, it was a murder and mayhem mystery, but the telling of this tale with Mr Horowitz being exactly what he is an author, made for an excellent way to both get to know him as well as read of his interaction with the very astute but totally weird ex detective Daniel Hawthorne, a bit of a British Detective Columbo. Just imagine planning your own funeral. Diana Cowper, a wealthy woman with a movie star son, Daniel, does such a thing. The mystery begins when Diana is found strangled in her home only six hours after the master plan of her funeral is arranged. How could she possibly have known she would be dead shortly after seeing the funeral director? Diana had a checkered past being involved ten years ago in a hit and run that left one young boy dead and another irreparably disabled. She also had seemed to get away with it with only a bit of a slap on the wrist which might be another little clue to the story. Therein lies the case who killed Diana, and as Hawthorne meets with Horowitz we learn that the ex detective wants Horowitz to write a book on his exploits. They develop a kind of tenuous relationship as \"Tony\"(by the way he hates being called that), learns more and more about the elusive Hawthorn and his uncanny ability to see clues and solutions where none seem to be apparent. It is their interchange and search for the killer which drives this story forward with quite a few twists and turns with a nice amount of shady characters with possible motives. This was such a great read. I absolutely loved that the author inserted himself into the story and quite honestly had to ask myself could this be real? The interplay of the characters was a draw as well as the ending which was quite threatening to our author, or was it?I highly recommend this book for those who are looking for a different way of both writing and telling a story that was hard to put down. Clever and witty and one in which I do hope to see \"Tony\" and Daniel meet up once again and get that Hawthorne book written.Thank you to Anthony Horowitz, Harper Publishing, and Edelweiss for forwarding me an advanced copy of this totally engaging novel.

Anthony Horowitz has written a fictional book using himself as one of the primary characters. It's like reading a story within a story within a story. As a character, he is a writer, screenwriter, and speaks often of some of his real time books. He is Watson to a modern day Holmes ... whose name is Daniel Hawthorne.Hawthorne is a unique being, as well. He touts himself as a consultant to the police when it comes to unsolved murder cases. He has Horowitz following him around as he searches for clues and interrogates possible suspects.Their relationship is anything but easy. They each want this future book to be written a certain way ... and with two alpha males, it isn't happening. There are plenty of suspects to follow .... a theatrical producer who had lunch with the woman the same day she died.... her famous son, an actor, and some say a bully. Since everything she had has been left to him, he becomes someone to watch.... Her housecleaner, who found the body, yet lied to the police.... The number one suspect is the family of two young boys. 10 years ago the woman, driving her car without her glasses, plowed into them while they were crossing the street. One boy was killed outright .. the other boy left with massive head injuries. She was charged, but found not guilty. But the biggest question is ... dd the woman know she was going to die that day?Twists and turns, lies and secrets ... all the marvelous things that make a murder mystery a great read.

The investigation is into the murder of Diana Cowper which happened just six hours after she\u2019d arranged her own funeral. Hawthorne is an ex-police detective who is called in to assist with some of the more bizarre investigations and he\u2019s also the man who wants Anthony Horowitz to shadow him during this investigation to enable him to write about him solving this murder.The whole story is a real page turner, with a splendid mix of murder mystery, suspense and thriller with a large dose of more factual information concerning the author\u2019s work as an author and scriptwriter. I found it a fascinating read with stories within stories like Russian Dolls you reveal as the story progresses. The author portrays his mood and attitude as events unfold as well as sharing many of his accomplishments which serve as background to the main story. His somewhat strained relationship with Hawthorne results in great banter between the two and the author is often portrayed as being inept in the investigation by Hawthorne\u2019s comments and responses. Horowitz is reluctant to work with Hawthorne but is drawn in by the strange circumstances preceding the murder - like the reader, he wants to know what happened, so still keeps working with Hawthorne.This has to be one of the most unique books I\u2019ve read, complete with plenty of angst, twists and turns to keep readers guessing to the very end. The story is an enthralling skilful blend of fact and fiction, mixed together by a highly talented wordsmith to create a superb murder mystery that I have no hesitation whatsoever in highly recommending.I requested and was given a copy of this book via NetGalley and this is my honest opinion after choosing to read it."}, {"userName": "Ova Incekaraoglu", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5316099-ova-incekaraoglu", "userReview": "Please see full review on my blog: https://excusemyreading.com/2018/01/0...Really loved this book!

Is this a coincidence? Did she knew she was going to be murdered? And more importantly, who is the murderer?

Although, of course, magnets can repel as well as attract.\nI knew from the start that\u00a0The Word Is Murder was going to be unlike anything I'd ever read. Anthony Horowitz has written himself into his next mystery novel, during which he gets more than he bargained for in a murder mystery he was hoping to use as inspiration for his next mystery novel. Yes, you read that correctly.Horowitz's fictional version of himself enters into an unlikely partnership with a disgraced detective he never much cared for. It's a symbiotic relationship: the prickly ex-detective Hawthorne wants to be immortalized on paper, and he drops a case in Horowitz's lap that's intriguing enough to have Horowitz cast his reservations aside. But Hawthorne's personality doesn't make tagging along for the investigation a trivial process; they're butting heads left and right over everything from Hawthorne refusing to share slivers of his personal life to the eventual title of the novel itself (he's a proponent of\u00a0Hawthorne Investigates, much to Horowitz's continued dismay). I found myself in the same boat as our narrator, constantly straddling the line between irritated and begrudgingly impressed by Hawthorne's unconventional methods, and I loved the meta undercurrent throughout the whole novel where Horowitz stresses over how Hawthorne will translate into a story's protagonist.The plot was a blast to read. We join Hawthorne and Horowitz as they chase obscure leads throughout London, pulling at even the slimmest of threads and watching them unravel. At the core of the mystery is a woman who planned her own funeral and was murdered later that same day, but there are secrets buried deep in her past and in the lives of those around her, and nothing is what it seems. Some parts of the mystery were predictable, but others kept me guessing throughout, even despite the narrator's meta foreshadowing and Hawthorne's ability to identify the truth of a scene upon first glance. Horowitz obsesses over the details, never sure which seemingly tangential clues will be the next to get Hawthorne's spotlight, and by the end of the novel when everything clicks into place, you really do get the sense the answers were right there in front of you all along.The Word Is Murder is a delight of a novel and easily one of the most creative endeavors I've read all year. It's incredibly self-aware and meta, and half the fun is trying to pick out the truth from the embellishments from the flat-out fiction. I absolutely\u00a0loved the ending and found it befitting of the tone of the entire story and Hawthorne and Horowitz's tumultuous relationship. This is one book that will be sticking with me for awhile.

Nothing too uncommon about this, especially since she is a widow and her only son has moved to the States to pursue his successful acting career. But it takes on a very different aspect when, later that same day, she is strangled to death in her own home. Disgraced ex-policeman Daniel Hawthorne is called in by his old boss to investigate the crime on a consulting basis. Hawthorne thinks it would be a great idea if someone were to write a book showing him in action \u2013 and he knows just the man for the job... Horowitz is one of the cleverest plotters out there at the moment and I've loved his last several books. In this one, however, I feel he allows that cleverness to lead him down a route that, for me at least, becomes too quirky to be totally enjoyable. It transpires that the man Hawthorne has in mind to write his book is none other than Horowitz himself. So the fictional mystery quickly gets blended into a lot of, I assume, largely factual stuff about Horowitz's actual writing career. My problem with this is that either his characterisation of himself is heavily fictionalised, in which case, what's the point? Or it's mostly true, in which case, sadly, I found him a rather unlikeable chap with an overhealthy sense of his own worth and importance, who simply loves to name-drop. I spent most of the book trying to convince myself he was attempting to be humorous by deliberately showing himself off as a cultural snob and an aspiring lovey, but if so, it wasn't made clear enough. I tired quickly of the long digressions where he breaks away from the story to discuss the making of Foyle's War, the amazing success of his books, or his meetings with Steven Spielberg and David Jackson to discuss film scripts, even though he occasionally attempts to include a bit of self-deprecatory humour. I've said before that personally I prefer not to know much about authors since knowing about their personalities can get in the way of my appreciation of their books. I therefore avoid literary biographies and autobiographies of all but the long dead, and rarely read author interviews or articles about them for the same reason. So I'm aware that my adverse reaction to this book arises out of that dislike and therefore won't be the same for readers who do like to know about authors' lives \u2013 in fact, I'm almost certain they'll find this aspect adds a lot of fun. Otherwise, the plotting is excellent, as is the quality of the writing. The clues are all given, so in that sense it's fairplay, though I think it would take a healthy dose of luck for anyone to get close to the solution \u2013 I certainly didn't. The story goes to some dark places but there's a lot of humour so that the overall tone is of a light entertainment. Hawthorne didn't ring true to me at all, nor did the idea that a policeman who had been sacked would be called in on a murder investigation, but I didn't feel Horowitz was really going for realism. To be truthful, I'm not altogether sure what he was going for. He's clearly doing a kind of update of the Holmes/Watson relationship \u2013 he gives the impression that he was writing this at the same time as his excellent books set in the Holmesian world, The House of Silk and Moriarty. But, unlike Holmes and Watson, I found neither of these characters particularly admirable or likeable. And an awful lot of the \u201cdetection\u201d element simply consists of characters giving great long uninterrupted speeches explaining all the various events in their pasts that have some connection with the present-day crime.Overall, I found it a reasonably enjoyable read but, probably at least in part because of my high expectations, something of a disappointment. I'm sure most Horowitz fans will enjoy it and have already seen several people praise it highly, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it as one for newcomers to his work. And I'm hoping I can get Horowitz the character out of my head before Horowitz the author publishes his next book...NB This book was provided for review by the publisher, Random House Cornerstone.www.fictionfanblog.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9809518-christine", "userReview": "I wonder if most writers would love to star in their own work? I am sure they do. Well this time, Anthony Horowitz has actually achieved it. He is the author and the sidekick, in his latest novel. The Word Is Murder is a clever Sherlock Holmes style mystery, staring the author himself. All in all, we get a weird and rather delightful twist on the genre. This is my kind of story.We all should know Anthony Horowitz. I suspect we have all seen some of his television work. I must admit to being a Foyle\u2019s War fan. I\u2019ve also seen the odd episode of other things he has written. He has an impressive back catalogue. In A Word Is Murder, we get to know him on a whole new level. Or the fictionalised version of him. We see that he hobnobs with the likes of Steven Spielburg and appears at literary festivals. Horowitz gets drawn into a mystery, a rather odd little tale. Diana Cowper goes into a local undertakers and arranges her own funeral. Later that day, she is murdered. The police bring in a consultant to help them with this unusual case. It is ex-copper, Hawthorne, who is very much a Sherlock Holmes style character. With a single glance, Hawthorne can read people. Hawthorne wants his cases to be recorded and he brings in Horowitz, as a kind of biographer. Hawthorne and Horowitz investigate. They bicker. Horowitz tries to write. It is all very surreal, incredibly witty and a hoot to read.This was a joy to read. I can not remember the last time I read a book, with a massive grin on my face. The humour is just superb and very British. It feels like an old fashioned Agatha Christie crime novel. Yet at the same time, we can tell it is modern day England, with all its up to date forensics and gadgetry. The author is very much paying homage to Sherlock Holmes; Hawthorne and Horowitz feel like a modern Sherlock Holmes and Watson. He blends fact and fiction, to the point where you don\u2019t know what is real.Thank you for recording your adventures with Hawthorne, Mr Horowitz. You did a fabulous job. We all love it!

Horowitz is not only the author, he is also one of the main characters.After a brutal murder ex detective Daniel Hawthorne (occasional consultant to the police) asks novelist Horowitz to write a book about him investigating the crime. At first it is a little odd reading a story with the author as a main character, but what makes it work for me is the humour. Hawthorne constantly calls the author Tony (which he hates) & attacks his writing ability at every opportunity. It's great to see an author happy to send himself up.There are times when Hawthorne seems little more than a stereotypical rogue detective, but I love the humour he generates in the novel.

I\u2019ve never read a book by Anthony Horowitz before so this audio CD was my first experience of his work. And I absolutely loved The Word Is Murder. EVERYTHING about this book worked for me! As I listened to it in the car I found myself taking unnecessarily long journeys whenever I had anywhere to go and once sat on the driveway for nearly an hour \u201cfinishing off\u201d takeaway coffee just because I was so caught up in the drama that I didn\u2019t want to turn it off and go into the house!!The story seems to be a simple murder mystery with a private investigator brought in to solve it. But unlike other books, the author himself is actually a character IN HIS OWN BOOK!! Yes, that\u2019s right Anthony Horowitz appears as himself and this gives the book a truly authentic and original feel! Sometimes it felt almost autobiographical as Horowitz talked about his writing plus his current and past projects with plenty of name dropping along the way. The narrator Rory Kinnear really brought him to life, to the point where I would actually hate to hear the real Anthony Horowitz speak as it would ruin my illusions! This was definitely one of the best audio book narration I have heard for a very long time and I would highly recommend listening to this if you like audiobooks.Hawthorne, the private investigator, comes to Horowitz to ask him to write a book (preferred by Hawthorne to be called Hawthorne Investigates!!) about a murder that has taken place. They then work together like a modern day Sherlock Holmes and Watson to solve the crime presented. There are clues along the way that I have to admit I failed to notice but I was so completely involved with the storyline that I was just enjoying the ride too much to even think about solving the crime itself!The characterisation kept me focused throughout the plot as the wonderfully intriguing and enigmatic Hawthorne managed to both wind up and impress Horowitz in equal measures. His way of using his powers of perception to get a rise out of his unlikely partner-in-crime-solving was very funny to listen to. In fact, there was far more humour in the book than I was expecting, and some of it very dark indeed. The comment about the Stieg Larsson book by the side of the dead woman\u2019s bed, actually had me laughing aloud to myself in the car at a moment where there should have been a quiet respect for the murder victim! And I loved listening to Horowitz being \u201cSherlocked\u201d by his new partner!I\u2019m so glad this is going to be part of a new series because I can\u2019t wait to meet Hawthorne again. For a man of hidden depths, he certainly managed to keep many of those layers under wraps for us to uncover next time! This ingenious crime drama was polished and gripping with a dark sense of humour that worked perfectly within the characterisation and the plot. The factual information threaded throughout the fictional story was fascinating and intrinsically linked to the plotline, raising the standard of what could have been just a solid piece of crime fiction to a very high level indeed. I was surprised by how much I thoroughly enjoyed this and was very sad to leave it by the time the last CD came to an end.Highly recommended by me in any format but the audio CD version really did work well for me."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4843124-melanie", "userReview": "3.5 stars. I had been looking forward to the new novel by Horowitz, with his past three novels, he has firmly established himself as a favourite of mine. So imagine how much my heart sank when I started reading, realising that this was a first person narrative of faux-non-fiction of himself being part of a murder investigation and writing about it. I hate novels where a writer investigates a crime and writes about it. HATE THEM. Alas, I kept reading (I bought it and I gave him the benefit of doubt) and I was surprised to find that I was entertained and intrigued. The mystery is solid, the delivery is funny and engaging and so it was a really solid mystery. The reason it's not higher is that I find it hard to reconcile a mixture of real and fiction because I had to keep googling as to who was a real person and who was an invention. Still, highly enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Diane Challenor", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5947827-diane-challenor", "userReview": "Everyone, let me tell you, this man can write.

Horowitz is actually a character himself in the story and solely narrates things, it was a straightforward, good old fashioned murder mystery and it was executed flawlessly while also implementing a fresh, unusual tactic that I enjoyed immensely.Horowitz teams up with an ex police officer named Hawthorne after he recruits him, you see he works now as a consultant to the police and is investigating the murder of a lady who was killed six hours after she planned her own funeral. Hawthorne thinks he would make a fabulous character in a book, he just wants Horowitz to do the writing, tag along as he investigates and keep his mouth shut. Their partnership is not one of those with amazing chemistry and two people who immediately work well together, they type who can finish each other sentences. These two are the unlikeliest of duos and have the sort of relationship where one tiptoes around the other, you\u2019re never sure if they like each other or merely tolerate each other, one minute they seem to be having fun and the next you\u2019re wondering if they\u2019ll kill each other. This was highly refreshing and just so different, the entire investigation unraveled in a strange way, but one that was satisfying as hell. It was twisty without being over the top, it was subtle but really sharp too.If you want a different kind of crime novel, a throwback to Agatha Christie, add this to your TBR. It\u2019s smart and well written, I felt like I had a 400 page intimate chat with Horowitz and absolutely zoomed through it. I enjoyed it so much in fact that I\u2019m hoping one of my new favorites duos teams up again in a future installment!The Word is Murder in three words: Ingenious, Crafty and Creative."}, {"userName": "Mayke", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47620815-mayke", "userReview": "Review soon to come and other reviews on my blog (bio)---------------------------------------------------------------------------This book was provided to me by Netgalley and Random House UK for an honest review.

It has a structure which I would expect to dislike: Anthony Horowitz casts himself in a central role in what purports to be a true-crime story, but is, of course, completely fictional. This leads to a lot of knowing stuff about how he is going to write the book and the whole thing is as much about how he writes his work as it is about the crime story. Horowitz does it very well and, to my surprise, I liked those aspects of the narrative.Set in London in 2011, the story is of a woman who walks into an undertaker's office to make arrangements for her own funeral, and is then murdered a few hours later. The case is investigated by the police, of course, but also by Hawthorne, and ex-police officer with whom Horowitz has worked as a consultant on TV screenplays. Hawthorne wants Horowitz to write a book about his investigation, and he eventually agrees to become his amanuensis and sort of assistant. This all works pretty well as a device; it allows Horowitz to have fun introducing aspects of his own life (which may or may not be true, of course) and also allows him to have his cake and eat it rather. There's a good deal of \"if I was making this all up, I wouldn't have done it like this\" sort of stuff \u2013 which again, I was surprised to find I rather liked. (You can tell, by the way, that he has been writing Sherlock Holmes stories, as Hawthorne's methods, if not his character, have a very Holmesian feel.)It's not all great; the ending is pretty silly, to be honest \u2013 with the killer explaining everything to the captured investigator whom he intends to kill as a crowing clich\u00e9. Also, there are a few characters who are made to resemble real people closely enough to be disconcerting. A vain, manipulative actor called Damian who is about to star in a new series called Homeland? The physical description doesn't fit and he went to the wrong acting school, but\u2026 Or a director who \"wishes to remain anonymous,\" about whom Horwitz then gives such full, extraneous detail that she is plainly identifiable as Janet Steel. It's odd, and it's something I didn't like.Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable, readable book. Place and characters are well evoked and I found it a very entertaining read for most of its length. Recommended.(I received an ARC via NetGalley.)"}, {"userName": "Trev Twinem", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3542870-trev-twinem", "userReview": "For fans of Ruth Rendell and Agatha Christie \"The Word is Murder\" is a very clever detective story which places the author as one of the central characters. Hawthorne is a retired detective and wishes to use his sharp analytical mind to help solve the death of wealthy woman Diana Cowper who is murdered six hours after she arranges her own funeral. He enlists the help of a reluctant author and it is hoped that both will not only solve the crime but also create a bestselling novel. What gives this story an almost comic edge is the relationship between \"Tony\" the author and the irascible detective Daniel Hawthorne. The novel proceeds and the usual suspects are introduced and portrayed before the reader, the hope always being that the murderer can be identified from the clues presented. To me the real pleasure of reading this story was the comical and descriptive writing on display by an established and respected author;.....\"Again, I found myself wondering what it must be like to work there, sitting in a room with those miniature urns, a constant reminder that everything you were and everything you'd achieved would one day fit inside.\".......\"For him, politeness was a surgical mask, something he slipped on before he took out his scalpel.\"....\"There was a sense of something in the air that might have been damp but was actually just misery.\"....\"wearing a suit that could have come out of a charity shop- or should have been on the way to one.\"....\"You never realize how fragile everything is until it breaks.\"...\"It was as if she had been locked up in a lunatic asylum for so long that she had forgotten she was actually mad.\".... So with a cunning and clever plot, mysterious and intricate characters all presented in an entertaining dialect \"The Word is Murder\" is a highly enjoyable and recommended read."}, {"userName": "Quintin Zimmermann", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37960716-quintin-zimmermann", "userReview": "Anthony Horowitz blends fiction with non-fiction as he inserts himself into his own mystery novel as the first-person narrator. As a real world author, he fuses his real life experiences and interactions with his fictional characters. It is a rather clever device, but Horowitz dismally fails with his own express intentions - \"I had to be sure that I wasn't too obtrusive, that I didn't get in the way\". Horowitz's continued attempts to upstage his own principal protagonist, the disgraced former detective, Hawthorne, came across as facile and churlish. Hawthorne, who is unashamedly a Holmesian clone, is not well supported by his Watson, namely Horowitz, who continously seems to bungle the investigation and place himself in absurd situations. Anthony Horowitz is a talented author and, despite my criticisms, this crime novel is still a page-turner for a younger audience with some twists that I did not see coming. Unfortunately, Horowitz's own intrusions into his narrative wasn't the right foil for his complex detective to truly shine."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7297687-jen", "userReview": "3.5 This was really clever.I know for a fact that the main reason I liked it so much was because it broke the boundary between reality and fiction as the main character in the story is the author (amazing).The characters dynamics didn't really work for me all the time and I found Hawthorne pretty insufferable but over all a solid story with a fun perspective."}, {"userName": "Naty", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17954042-naty", "userReview": "This review was originally posted at https://natysbookshelf.wordpress.com/I received this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I have been wondering how to review this book since I started reading it and, now that I\u2019m finished, I am still not sure. The first thing to say is that it\u2019s unique, not your typical murder mystery, and it\u2019s strange. I was not sure if I\u2019d liked it until it was over, and I think a better way to describe is that it definitely left an impression on me. It stuck in my mind and got me googling all through the story. So: yes, I enjoyed it!I started reading The Word is Murder expecting it to be similar in style to Magpie Murders, which I enjoyed, although I thought the ending rather predictable. But I was wrong \u2013 except for being a murder mystery as well, the similarities between the two books stop there. In this very unique and interesting novel, Horowitz blurred the lines between fiction and non-fiction to the point where I had to do some googling to figure out what was true and what wasn\u2019t.The plot is really intriguing: a wealthy middle-aged woman arranges her own funeral and hours later, she is murdered. Who killed her? Did she know she was going to be murdered? If not, was organizing her funeral a coincidence? The unemployed detective Hawthorne is short on money, and when he gets hired to investigate the murder of Mrs. Cowper, he decides to turn it into a book \u2013 which is where Horowitz (yes, the author) comes in.But it feels that the murder is only half the story, where the other half is Horowitz\u2019 life & career.Horowitz talks extensively about his writing process and his career, which sometimes I found interesting and sometimes bothersome. It felt like a book about the process of writing this same book and this meta situation was both intriguing and frustrating \u2013 I wished at times that there was less Horowitz and more murder mystery. At the same time, I do enjoy getting to know more about writers and their writing process, but I would then rather read an interview and some articles about it. I don\u2019t want it to be half of a murder mystery book. If you\u2019re a long-term fan of Horowitz, I think you might actually enjoy this very much! He talks extensively about his Alex Rider series, about the script-writing for murder mystery TV series and so on. I particularly wasn\u2019t too keen on such a level of detail such as he presented for that.The character construction felt a little flat to me. They all seemed like taken from a Catalog of Whodunit Suspects, and even giving them backstories rather extensively didn\u2019t feel enough to give them actual complexity and personalities. They were all likely to have murdered Mrs. Cowper. I found specially the women from the book quite flat. The detective Hawthorne is written to be unlikable, and then we have Horowitz in a Hastings/Watson position of the less intelligent companion who guides the reader away from the clues and into wrong conclusions (no offence at all for the \u201cless intelligent\u201d part meant, those characters are normally quite intelligent, just not as much as the detective, especially to provide a contrast and admiration for said detective).But never once was I impressed or interested in Hawthorne at all, and both the clues and the process of uncovering the mystery were everywhere, not following the kind of structure I prefer. I like my murder mysteries nice and cleanly presented. This book felt more like a real-case mess, with lots of relevant and irrelevant information. So that is quite the charm of it.Veredict: This book is an intriguing mix of classic whodunit with non-fiction. If you love reading about writers and how they write, you\u2019ll enjoy this one, especially if you\u2019ve been a fan of Horowitz for a while. It\u2019s quite hard to put a line between fiction and non-fiction on this one and it\u2019s what makes it so unique!"}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1496564-robin", "userReview": "If you read MAGPIE MURDERS and was expecting a sequel or something along the same lines of a mystery-within-a-mystery, be prepared for something totally different. Horowitz shakes this up by incorporating himself into the plot to become \"Watson\" to the ex-detective Hawthorne's modern-day \"Sherlock.\" Horowitz has written for a number of TV series and shows (most notably Foyle's War, something I didn't know) and drops a number of notable names from the entertainment world and part of the fun is trying to figure out what is and isn't real. The story soon becomes a fairly linear mystery with the two trying to figure out who murdered a woman just a few hours after she went to a mortuary to plan her own funeral. Red herrings and clues keep the reader guessing and the solution was a total surprise.Horowitz has done a masterful job of creating a various cast of characters, especially Hawthorne who is irritating yet also quite brilliant. It appears as if this could become a series, but then I thought that would happen with THE MAGPIE MURDERS.Even with the story line twist, this is perfect for fans of straight whodunits and for readers of Agatha Christie, Louise Penny, Robert Galbraith (J. K. Rowling), and, of course, Sherlock Holmes.Thanks to the publisher for the advance reading copy."}, {"userName": "Jessica Woodbury", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury", "userReview": "Usually when I realize I am not liking a book much I will stop reading it. And I almost stopped reading this one. I can tell you the exact page I was on when I had that NOPE moment. At that point I pulled up the Goodreads page and I was, well, flummoxed. This book's page is stacked with glowing reviews. And I knew from the success of MAGPIE MURDERS that this one will be popular, so I decided to keep going to see if the book would redeem itself. It did not. So I am here to potentially save a few other readers from my fate with what will hopefully be my one not-great review of the year.The main problem here is the device, where the writer is asked to accompany a detective to write a true crime book about a crime he is in the middle of trying to solve. It is a particularly ridiculous device, and I've mostly seen it on television where it works better because we never actually have to see what the writer will write. Because this is not how writing works! No writer would do this! And having to read the product of it is not particularly fun.I was willing to give Horowitz some leeway because he was rather fun and smart in his use of writers and publishing in MAGPIE but he quickly lost me. The main device bothered me constantly and would have been reason enough to quit this book, but there is something even worse: Horowitz himself.Usually when someone writes a fictionalized version of themselves, they actively make this person different, they often create a whole separate persona so you can see it is not really them. I have no idea if Horowitz did that or not, all I know is that the Horowitz on the page is the worst. He talks about himself all the time, even though the things he talks about aren't relevant to the mystery we're supposed to be here to solve. He drops celebrity names, he is not shy about his massive success, and I actually hated him by the end of the book. The whole story would have made much more sense with a fictional struggling writer who really needs this gig. With Horowitz the whole thing is just off.Horowitz's sleuth, Hawthorne, is not much to write home about. The main thing to know about Hawthorne is that he is unlikable. He is a Holmes-ian detective, working almost entirely through observation. This is never my personal fave, but I would tolerate it if Hawthorne had more to offer on the page. He doesn't. There's no rapport or camaraderie between the two that makes it worth your time. The plot is fine, pretty run of the mill, was expecting something more interesting. That's why I kept reading, I figured Horowitz had to have something better up his sleeve. But he didn't. To me, it feels like Horowitz missed the mark pretty hard, not understanding what it was about MAGPIE that made it both a throwback and a new invention. Here he's trying to add a modern twist but it doesn't work at all, and not much else does either."}, {"userName": "Thebooktrail", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25264586-thebooktrail", "userReview": "Visit the locations in the novel The Word is MurderWhat a fascinating book!
