Wyn is magical to me...she is serious, she is a survivor, she thinks deeply, and she loves fully. Mac...her husband...as much as I wanted to appreciate him...I could not. He is flawed and suffering from a deep depression and doesn't seem to care that he is...at first. He shuts out Wyn...totally. So...Mac is depressed and not enamored with Wyn any more. Wyn chooses to take the vacation that she and Mac were supposed to take together...alone...at their island home...baking bread and making new friends. Alex...a chef and friend...offers up food and love...and Wyn needs both. My thoughts after reading this book...Wyn's successful bread shop is in Southern California but my favorite parts of this book took place on Orcas Island...and included artists, rain, chickens that lay bluish eggs, Farmer's Markets, ferries, sailing, bread baking, and so much more. The story begins with a funeral and sort of ends with that funeral, too. For me everything in between is trying to understand characters and their many issues. Much of what happened has Orcas Island, Wyn's house and her bakery as a backdrop. I can picture every movement that Wyn made while cooking...in particular when she made soup and cheddar corn biscuits. Dropping each chopped vegetable into the sizzling olive oil...now my new way to make soup.What I loved best...I really loved all of this book...it's intense...it's stories about people living very fragile lives and trying to understand why these things are happening to them. Wyn is the character who works so hard with people and who cares so much. I loved that about her.What potential readers might want to know...I love this series so much...especially Bread Alone...that I really want to tell potential readers to read them all in the order they were written to get a full sense of Wyn and other characters. Their growth is so important to recognize. But...I think this can be a stand alone book, too. The author does a lovely job of helping readers to \"get\" Wyn. My thoughts are that this book is very special. I craved lattes and breads all weekend long!"}, {"userName": "Debbie Hoffman", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3453129-debbie-hoffman", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the first two books in this series, light and entertaining.

That is how I read the first book in this series. And I was ecstatic to find that there were 2 more to be read! I am quite familiar with most of the setting of the Baker trilogy....Seattle, Orcas Island and L.A., which was appealing, but Wyn became a character I just cared about in a very personal way. I'll admit, that there were times wading through all 3 books that I started to think \"Oh my God, another problem, can you self absorbed people just please figure out your dirty laundry and quit being so dramatic?\" Haha. Then I remembered I WANTED to have more time with these characters and if there were no problems I'd be reading a pretty boring novel. I really enjoyed Skye and actually feel a bit now like I want to know more about HER, too! All in all I was pleasantly entertained by these books, and inspired to do a LOT more bread baking...so I'll take that away as a huge positive.

Judi writes with great detail in every part of her story, including depression which seems to be one of those topics you discuss in private, whispering. And there was no 'neat and tidy' end to Baker's Blues, but a sense that Wyn will be ok, Skye will meet somebody, and that Mac would be watching. Judi Hendricks is a truly gifted writer.

The book starts out with an unexpected event, something that I was saddened to read as I was happy to hear what had happened with Mac and Wyn at the end of the second book. As I read on, I realized that the beginning was something that had happened in the present, while the majority of the book was a flashback to Mac and Wyn's lives, both together, and separate. I really enjoyed reading about the two of them together, and the problems that they faced. I loved how Mac's depression was detailed for us to read, which made us feel as though he was a real person, as depression is a problem that plagues many of us, but we are often unsure on how to approach the subject. I also loved reading about Wyn's role as owner at Baker's Maven, and how she interacted with her employees on a daily basis. Tyler was a completely different person, and I loved the Tyler depicted in this book; smart yet edgy, definitely a huge improvement from how she was in the second book.

At some places, I did not like the tone of Hendricks\u2018s when she writes about Mac\u2018s depression. It was more of an outsider\u2018s objective look; lacking a real empathy or even understanding of this illness. It might also be due to the fact that the excessive repetition of the same incidents to make the reader believe that there was no other option for Wyn but to leave him makes the whole depression story a bit formulaic. On the other hand, I liked how the trilogy is structured; this last volume, like the first one is also about the end of a marriage and how she finds her way back to life with the help of backing bread.

I quickly devoured it, waited for the followup--The Baker's Apprentice, and also scooped up her other two books (not in the series) Isabel's Daughter and The Laws of Harmony. In the years in between, I would think about these books and look to see if the author had written another. It was a LONG six years of being disappointed, so when I saw Baker's Blues on a list of upcoming TLC Book Tours and found out it continued Wyn's story, I clamoured to be on the tour. It was worth the wait. Judith Ryan Hendricks has created a wonderful world with Wyn, her friends, family and of course the food, because the way the author writes, the food almost becomes its own character. She so lovingly describes the food in a vivid and very detailed way--that so many authors don't--which both completely feeds (pun fully intended) my food geekiness as well as leaves me hungry and craving whatever the characters are eating. Her characters are drawn equally well, created with multiple layers, and they quickly find their way to your heart. This is good because I love characters that I can connect to, and it's bad because it makes me care too much. In this case, I spent most of Baker's Blues feeling sad, disappointed, and occasionally mad at/about Mac, Wyn's ex-husband, who has drowned at the start of the book. (This isn't a spoiler as you can read it in the book blurb and in the first pages of the book itself.) I love Wyn, I loved Mac, I loved Wyn and Mac. Since the book is told in three parts, the now--with Mac's death, the then--the events leading up to Mac's death and how he became Wyn's ex-husband, and the after--Wyn's grieving and healing time after his death, it was really like going through the sad breakup of two good friends and then losing one. So mostly kudos to the author for making me so emotionally invested, but a small knock on the head for making me emotionally overwrought. ;-) I kid (slightly), lest you think I am an emotional basket case who can't tell fiction from reality, or you think I considered the book to be all doom and gloom. The book is about life and Wyn's journey--it is real, has heart, and humor, Wyn's often funny friends and supporters, and all of that mouthwatering bread and food--so well worth my bouts of angst. If you have not been pulled into Wyn's life and the world that Judith Ryan Hendricks has created in her Bread Alone series, I suggest you start with the first two books before starting Baker's Blues. It isn't that Baker's Blues can't stand alone, but your appreciation of the story and the characters will be much improved by starting at the beginning. Since it had been quite a few years since I read the series, I went back and skimmed The Baker's Apprentice to catch myself up. When time allows, I will go back to Bread Alone as well. And, fingers crossed that I won't be waiting another six years for the next Judith Ryan Hendricks book!

I have waited a long time for another book in this series and it\u2019s here! It\u2019s called Baker\u2019s Blues and it\u2019s a wonderful book that touched my heart. Judi has a warm style of writing \u2013 much like the thought of warm bread out of the oven with lots of butter slathered on \u2013 that just invites you to cozy up in your chair and devour her books page by page. The Bread Alone series follows Wyn Morrison and while Baker\u2019s Blues can stand on it\u2019s own I really think a reader would benefit from reading all of them and in order because this is such a great series and as you read the story continues to evolve and you come to care about Wyn and her love for those close to her as well as for baking bread.In Baker\u2019s Blues, on a warm July morning Wyn receives a phone call that nobody likes to get \u2013 her ex husband Mac is dead. While they were divorced she still loved Mac and she\u2019s devastated, so much so that she can\u2019t seem to work through her grief. So while Wyn is still running her bakery she\u2019s kind of drifted away from being hands on in the process of baking bread and she feels the need to get back to that. As she takes her place in the bread rotation she begins to reflect on the past and her life with Mac and all that happened that led her to this point in her life.I found this novel quite emotional as Wyn remembers the good and the bad times she experienced with Mac. As they began their relationship and marriage they were so happy but as time went on Mac spiraled into a deep depression and the novel addresses the effects of depression not only on the person experiencing it but also on those who have to live with them. If you\u2019ve ever experienced depression yourself or lived with someone who has this story will really hit home with you. You can feel how much Wyn loves Mac but nothing she does seems to fix him or their relationship. As well as the emotional side to this story you still get all the foodie references that are a part of Judi\u2019s novels and as usual reading one of her books makes me want to bake a loaf of fresh bread just for the warm yeasty smell of it.Once again Judi Hendricks has fully drawn me into another of her stories. Not only was I emotionally invested in this story and in Wyn\u2019s thoughts and feelings but also in the descriptions of the settings and the food and the adorable Corgi Charles made me swoon being the dog lover I am. I think this may be the last book in the Bread Alone series but I hope not. I\u2019d love another novel that takes us through the next part of Wyn\u2019s life. I also have to make mention of the beautiful cover on Baker\u2019s Blues \u2013 I love the vivid colors and the kneading of the dough \u2013 it\u2019s gorgeous! Highly recommended for foodies and those who love women\u2019s fiction!"}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28397744-maggie", "userReview": "I loved the Bread Alone series!

Wyn Morrison is back and this time, usually a 5am phone call means problems at her bakery\u2014equipment trouble or a first shift employee is calling in sick. But the news she receives this July morning is anything but expected.Mac, her ex-husband, is dead. If you\u2019ve read BREAD ALONE or THE BAKER\u2019S APPRENTICE, you know Wyn\u2019s ex, Mac, and if you haven\u2019t, you quickly will. Ineligible for widowhood, Wyn is nonetheless shaken to her core as she discovers that the fact of divorce offers no immunity from grief. Friends and family are surprised by Wyn\u2019s reaction of sadness and Mac\u2019s daughter, Skye blames Wyn for his death.For the last several years Wyn has been more businesswoman than baker, leaving the actual kneading and bread making to others. Now, as she takes up her place in the bread rotation once more, she will sift through her memories, coming to terms with Mac and his demons, Skye\u2019s anger, and with Alex, who was once more than a friend. Soon she will re-learn the lessons of bread that she first discovered at the Queen Street Bakery in Seattle \u2013 bread rises, pain fades, the heart heals, and the future waits.Judith Ryan Hendricks has a pleasant style of writing BAKER\u2019S BLUES that makes you want to pour a glass of wine, settle into a big comfy chair and plan on staying there a little while reading \u2013 no sheets in the laundry to fold or dishes in the dishwasher to put away, just relax."}, {"userName": "Patty", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3550357-patty", "userReview": "I did not realize that this was the finale book of a trilogy when I decided to read it.

The book opens with the funeral of Wyn\u2019s ex husband although I could tell from the beginning that there was a lot unreserved between the two of them and between Wyn and her stepdaughter.This is really a book about relationships and how life changes some for the better, others for the worse and makes others stronger.

But it\u2019s important to keep people close because you don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll need them.The book starts in the present time but soon moves into the past as Wyn thinks back to how her relationship with Mac fell apart. His recently found daughter seems to think that it\u2019s Wyn\u2019s fault that Mac is dead.

(But it still provided enough detail about baking bread to satisfy my desire for some \"foodie\" information!)Although I didn't realize it at the time I started this book, it forced me to start thinking about my own life and my own relationships. As I have experienced episodes of clinical depression in my own life, I had been focused on my own perspective. Now, having read this book, I am considering how my demons, just like those of the character Mac in this book, affect those I know and interact with.I was pleased that there were no simple resolutions in this book, and that the narrator was also re-examining her own actions and what she might have done differently and how that might have changed her relationship with Mac and others. Also, I was struck by how the author handled the desire of Mac's long lost daughter to know her father from perspectives other than her mother's and uncle's (which were colored by Mac's absence).I think this book provides a thoughtful insight into a marriage, but one that translates into any number of other relationships where one of those involved is struggling with mental illness (acknowledged or otherwise)."}, {"userName": "pianogal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/333692-pianogal", "userReview": "I hated this book.

Hendricks is a good writer, but if she wanted to explore depression, she should have used new characters and not wrecked these. This book was nothing like the first two.

In The Baker's Apprentice readers and Wyn meet Mac a wandering literati, who is the recently deceased ex-husband in the opening of this newest installment.I don't usually say that books need to be read in order, but in this case readers will really experience a huge arc of Wyn's life if starting with Bread Alone. Not necessary, but if you intend to read all three, do it in order. These books are about families created from friendships, the simple things in life being important, and knowing that you can't fix everything for other people.

But I think all of us on some level have experienced depression and Ms. Hendricks made me feel like I could relate to the rollercoaster that living with a depressed person is.In the first chapter, we learn that Wyn's ex-husband Mac has died of a heart attack while swimming. Most of the rest of the book goes back in time to tell the story of when they married, the idyllic times they shared when they were struggling financially and also when they both found success; Wyn as a baker and owner of a boulangerie, and Mac as a writer.

You can reflect back on past relationships or just decisions and see if you could have done something differently, but you would have ended up somewhere different and is that a good thing?

They have that 3D 'reality' which makes them 'real', like us and keeps us interested in their story.For we non-Americans it is irritatingly American in some ways, all the prescription drug taking for example, and I would have loved a map to see where Orcas island was. But those nitpicks apart I thoroughly enjoyed the book and was left with some interesting ideas to think about."}, {"userName": "Retha Cameron", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14370384-retha-cameron", "userReview": "I loved this trilogy of books by Judith Ryan Hendricks. I won Baker's Blues in a goodreads giveay and after realizing it was the last book of 3, I ordered the other 2 and read them first. I am glad that I did they were truly worth the money. With the first two books, Bread Alone and The Baker's Apprentice, I found myself unable to put them down and I read them rather quickly. This last book I found myself reading slowly and having to put it down for a while and come back to it several times. It wasn't that it wasn't good, it was great, it was that I didn't want the story of Mac and Wynter to come to an end. My copy from the giveaway arrived wet from a post office screw up, and now has mold on some of the pages and is hard and warped. I loved the series so much I just may pay to replace it so I have a good copy to keep forever."}], "description": "In Wyn Morrison's world a 5 A.M. phone call usually means problems at her bakery--equipment trouble or a first shift employee calling in sick--annoying but mundane, fixable. But the news she receives on a warm July morning is anything but mundane. Or fixable. Mac, her ex-husband, is dead. Ineligible for widowhood, Wyn is nonetheless shaken to her core as she discovers that the fact of divorce offers no immunity from grief. Friends and family are bewildered by her spiral into sadness, Mac's daughter Skye blames her for his death. For the last several years Wyn has been more businesswoman than baker, leaving most of the actual bread making to others. Now, as she takes up her place in the bread rotation once more, she will sift through her memories, coming to terms with Mac and his demons, with Skye's anger, and with Alex, who was once more than a friend. Soon she will re-learn the lessons that she first discovered at the Queen Street Bakery in Seattle...bread is a process--slow, arduous, messy, unpredictable. It should be eaten with eyes closed and heart open.", "title": "Baker's Blues\n      \n          (Bread Alone #3)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26598747-baker-s-blues", "average": 3.84, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1442528187l/26598747.jpg", "reviews": 52, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/90075.Judi_Hendricks", "name": "Judi Hendricks"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Womens Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26598747-baker-s-blues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26018180-baker-s-blues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25824667-baker-s-blues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25725057-baker-s-blues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/681545.Bread_Alone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1355595.The_Baker_s_Apprentice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/405724.Isabel_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4399619-the-laws-of-harmony", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39750303-das-brot-des-lebens"]}
