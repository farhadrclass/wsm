I wanted to read more about the relationships Ezperanza makes and to see if anything evolves between her and Miguel. I really enjoyed this book. It would be an amazing multi-cultural book to use in the classroom. It uses Spanish words and phrases but also tells you what each one means. It shows how racism is bad and how it hurts people. It shows how people should not be treated a different way just because of their background. It is not only a great story, but it teaches a great lesson. I think this book would most likely attract teenage girls. The themes seem to be more girl orientated. I also suggest this book to children who understand racism and how it is bad. A good way to introduce this book could be during a social studies lesson about the Mexican culture or about how Hispanics come to the United States and how hard they work for a living.Subjects, Themes, and Big Ideas:Family is a huge theme in this story. It shows how much one needs their family. Esperanza almost became the mother once her mom got sick. She had to take care of two babies. She had to rely on another family to help her get through it all. Growing up is a big subject. Esperanza has to grow up fast once she reaches the United States. She had to take care of babies, do chores, watch over her mama, and she eventually goes out and works the fields. Her character developed greatly throughout the story and by the end, you realize how much she does care for those people around her.Characters:Esperanza is the main character. She grew up as a very rich girl in Mexico, then after the death of her father, she is forced to move to the United States and live as a poor girl. Romona is her mother who has a heart of gold. Even after she is forced to live the poor life, she still treats everyone kindly and respects everyone. Abuelita is the grandmother, and cannot go to the United States at first due to a swollen ankle she sustained in the house fire. Miguel is the son of Alfonso and Hortensia. He was a couple years older than Esperanza and they grew up together. Alfonso is an old friend of Esperanza\u2019s father and was in charge of all the field workers. Hortensia was the wife Alfonso, and the care taker of Esperanza. Senor Rodriguez is an old friend who helps them escape Mexico. Isabel is the cousin of Miguel and quickly becomes Esperanza\u2019s friend in the United States. Josefine and Juan are Miguel\u2019s aunt and uncle and arranged for them all to come to the United States and to have a place to live. Marta is the trouble maker of the camp, who wants to strike, and makes fun of Esperanza. Irene and Melina are two women who live on the campsite who end up befriending Esperanza and helping her with the babiesPlot summary:Esperanza lived a very rich life style in Mexico until her father is killed. They run away to Mexico with the help of their friends, but Esperanza is afraid she will not be able to adjust to the life style of being poor and does not know how she will live without her Abuelita. Her mama gets sick and Esperanza must work to earn money to pay the bills and to save up for Abuelita to come to the United States. Her mom ends up surviving and her Abuelita finally comes to the United States with the help of her friend Miguel.Strengths (including reviews and awards):Pura Belpre Award, 2001 ALA Top Ten Best Books for Young Adults Smithsonian Best Books 2000Publisher's Weekly Best Children's Books 2000 L.A. Times Best Books of 2000Drawbacks or other cautions:A huge caution could be the use of racism throughout the book. It shows how Hispanics were looked down upon and how people did not care. It also shows how other minorities were looked down on and how they were treated unfairly and place d into crowded camps. Teaching ideas:\u2022\tOne idea could be based around teaching about Mexico and their different customs.\u2022\tOne could teach about the Mexican revolution and how it affected the country and all the people.\u2022\tSince fruit is a huge part of the story, you could bring in the different types of fruits and vegetables mentioned in the book.\u2022\tThey could discuss how illegal immigrants cause a strain on the economy but how helpful they can be at the same time.\u2022\tOne could have the students write a different ending to the story.\u2022\tSince family is a huge part of the story, each student could do a little presentation on their family and why they are so important.\u2022\tAs a class, you could discuss different types of strikes that have happened throughout United States history.\u2022\tA teacher could lead a discussion about racism and how it affected the United States and why it is wrong."}, {"userName": "Naz (Read Diverse Books)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5774287-naz-read-diverse-books", "userReview": "I adored Esperanza, her family, and their story. <3"}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1075956-jenny", "userReview": "An inspiring story of struggle, hardship, and hope, Esperanza Rising gave me and my children much to discuss.

Set in the early 1930's, this book gives you a feel for the struggles of the Great Depression as well as California History . Filled with Spanish phrases and words, it's a great introduction to learning Spanish and shows many cultural aspects as well.This book is rich with ideas for great discussions on empathy, economics, labor unions, race relations, prejudice, rights, family, choices, hope, attitude, work, pride, and kindness.

She must work as a farm laborer (despite her upbringing and education) in southern California during the Great Depression. The characterization is lovely; they are well rounded with realistic concerns and struggles. This novel illuminates the unique plight of Mexican-American laborers during the Great Depression, including forced deportation, labor strikes, competition from the Dust Bowl \"Okies,\" profound discrimination, and horrific living conditions. Marvelous historical fiction![Booktalk this!: 10-14 year old girls.]"}, {"userName": "S", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2356352-s", "userReview": "This book was, I suppose, a good educational read: rather a beginner's Grapes of Wrath from a Mexican perspective. It covers very difficult issues of race, class difference, child labor and death with tact and a certain amount of gentleness.But overall after I was finished I could not help but be faced with the difficult feeling that Esparanza, while being an incredibly strong young woman and a good role model in that sense, often overlooks the immorality and unfairness of her situation in order to continue living and doing what she has to do. I mean, that's a totally valid theme and it's in many ways honorable of her but given the horrible situation she's in, there are a lot of questions that arise. Esparanza is a 13-year old pulled out of school, subjected to backbreaking and agonizing child labor and essentially orphaned. This is a terrible situation for a child to be in, but the close of the book lauds Esparanza for the great, strong person that she has become for her hard work. Look! She knows how to cook now! Look! She knows how to work hard instead of being pampered! Look! She no longer has any selfish wants or needs!If Esperanza were 18 or even 16 that sort of might fly, but the fact of the matter is that she is 13. She should not be in that situation and there is very little outrage towards the fact that she's in it. What makes it so especially questionable is the way that the strikers were portrayed. They were demonized--Marta, the main girl who attempts to lead the strikes and revolts (? I think that's her name) is looked at as Esperanza's opposite. Lazy, mean-spirited, angry, and violent. And later she is punished for her sins. All of the strikers are. For standing up and saying that children should not have to work, that humane housing and sanitations conditions should be met, that everyone should be paid a living wage. They are all arrested and deported, and afterwards Esparanza and her family are safe, saying, \"We are loyal to the company, so the company takes care of us.\" Oh, is that so? Where is the company when the dust storms happen and the workers are trapped in the blistering wind? Where is the company when the children have blistered hands form peeling starchy potatoes? Where is the company when Esperanza's mother nearly dies because of horrible working conditions and Esperanza is forced to pay for her medical bills?In fact, every time that there is a fight in the book and the battle between working and dealing with unfairness vs. fighting for a better world, working always wins out. I'm really not comfortable with the fact that the main themes of the book seem to be: \"Life sucks--plug on and deal with it,\" rather than \"Enact real, lasting social change so that life doesn't quite suck so bad for future generations.\" Esparanza in the end realizes that she essentially has no future and will never return to an education--it tops out at if she's lucky, she might be able to buy a very small house. And yet she has learned to be happy with that. I'm sorry, but I'm not."}, {"userName": "Xueting", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4691420-xueting", "userReview": "What a beautiful and beautifully simple story! I love the angles of perspective, the rich culture and largely ignored history of the Mexican repatriation, that the author explores. It's even better to learn that the author based the story largely on very true events of her grandmother's time. Esperanza is a lovely young heroine who matures so believably and admirably. I really like that she started as a pretty ignorant, hot-tempered and slightly spoiled child, so we can see that the Mexicans don't all suffer and have tragic pasts, they also have wonderful memories of comfort (not luxury but happy times). The Spanish in the book didn't hurt at all too, helped me to learn a bit more.

There was not one character I really cared about. I found I cared more about the roses they were transplanting than the people who were transplanted. I did like the growth I saw in Esperanza.This story was too didactic. Munoz didn't trust her reader enough to figure out what was right; she felt she had to tell them. She also had too many plot lines going that seemed to go nowhere at all. Murdered father, greedy and mean uncles wanting to marry mom and send child away, illegal immigration, mom in hospital, boy she likes but talks down to, strike and work unfairness, dust storms, Oakies coming to take their jobs, racism, etc - not one of which was addressed adequately. I felt like this story was all over the place.This seemed like a watered-down, rose-colored glasses Grapes of Wrath. Did the family end up okay? They now have a new mouth to feed and limited jobs, but everything will be okay? A thirteen year old girl would not have made enough money during that time period to pay her mother's hospital bills, support herself, and save money to bring Grandma to California - too unrealistic."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3146907-elaine", "userReview": "Wow what a powerfull story. Need I say that I spent an hour in tears as I was reading the book. Woke up with puffy eyes the next day. Unfortunately students only get to experience the Grapes of Wrath in high school. How marvelous would it be to also introduce them to Esperanza Rising, perhaps as part of an immigration unit and then have them analyze the different experiences of these two groups, the \"Oakies\" and the Mexican immigrants.I was so moved by the selfless act of Ramona to give up all that she was accustomed to, all the luxuries, all the wealth in order to set a positive example for her daughter. How difficult it must have been for her. This was probably why it took her so long to recover from her illness. I was so scared that Esperanza would lose her too, and quite honestly I would have been a wreck if that would have happened.Pam Munoz Ryan does such an excellent job of painting the setting in your mind and in developing each of the characters. At the beginning of the book Esperanza was a little girl and in only a few short months she developed and matured into a woman. A woman who finally realized what was important in life. I was thrilled to read the author's note to discover that in real life Esperanza and \"Miguel\" married.

Esperanza, the heroine of the story is the only child of the ranch owners. Misfortune comes to the family. Her father is killed just before she turns thirteen. Her greedy uncles inherit the ranch. One of her uncles, who wants to be a politican, offers to marry her mom, Ramona. Her love for her husband was so strong that the idea repulsed her. Esperanza and her mom are forced to leave their beloved Rancho de Las Rosas. They travel to California with their servants to find work in the migrant farms.Personal response: Eperanza Rising is a uplifting story of a girl who matures by facing very difficult situations in her life. The author uses metaphors and symbols throughout to add life to the story. In \"rising\" in the title refers to the phoenix legend of the mythical bird that arises out of its own ashes. Esperanza and Ramona rise from the fire set by her greedy uncles. The grandmother uses this story to let Esperanza understand that they too are rising to a new life in California. Abuelita also uses another metaphor where she compares the zig zag design on a blanklet to the zigzag pattern of the mountains and of life. She explains to Esperanza that life will have valleys and high points just like the mountains. Throughout the story blankets and shawls are used to represent comfort and protection. I learned that Esperanza Rising is the story of Pam Munoz Ryan grandmother.This story is very similiar to my family's story. My grandfather used to work on the California migrant farms in the early 1960's. I still remember going to visit him and stopping by the road to pick watermelons.

As Esperanza tries to adjust to the hardships of her camp life where she has to learn the basic chores, her mother gets sick. It is a story of riches to rags and how the courage and fortitude of Esperanza raises her above her living conditions and she emerges triumphant.I would recommend this book to tween and teens aged 10 to 13 for those who love historical fiction. This book could be also suggested it for an assigned reading of historical fiction. Although it does not go into details but the book mentions the Mexican Revolution, the company farm camps in California in the 1930's, the treatment of the Mexican immigrant workers, the strikes that happened for better working conditions and the Mexican Repatriation. In march 1929, the federal government passed the Deportation Act which gave counties the power to send great number of Mexicans back to Mexico regardless whether they were citizen or not.
