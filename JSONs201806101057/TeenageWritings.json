Some of them are quite wild or relentlessly silly; an early piece, for example, has two families so fond of one another that they kick each other out of windows all the time.I would not recommend these tales for people who are unfamiliar with Austen's work or with the phrasing of the time. Though every term or different usage is glossed at the end, it can be tiring to flip back and forth every third word. There's also a lot of ridiculous humor that makes no sense if you are unfamiliar with the social conventions."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/863250-wendy", "userReview": "I enjoyed this one! A lot of short stories, funny lists, mini history lessons, letters all with some amazing humor woven into them."}], "description": "Three notebooks of Jane Austen's early writings survive. The pieces probably date from 1786 or 1787, around the time that Jane, aged 11 or 12, and her older sister and collaborator Cassandra left school. By this point Austen was already an indiscriminate and precocious reader, devouring pulp fiction and classic literature alike; what she read, she soon began to imitate and parody.Unlike many teenage writings then and now, these are not secret or agonized confessions entrusted to a private journal and for the writer's eyes alone. Rather, they are stories to be shared and admired by a named audience of family and friends. Devices and themes which appear subtly in Austen's later fiction run riot openly and exuberantly across the teenage page. Drunkenness, brawling, sexual misbehavior, theft, and even murder prevail. It is as if Lydia Bennett is the narrator.", "title": "Teenage Writings", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32569962-teenage-writings", "average": 3.55, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1495782916l/32569962.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1265.Jane_Austen", "name": "Jane Austen"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/25280.Kathryn_Sutherland", "name": "Kathryn Sutherland"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1212534.Freya_Johnston", "name": "Freya Johnston"}], "type": ["Classics", "Anthologies"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32569962-teenage-writings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14935.Sense_and_Sensibility", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6969.Emma", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45032.Mansfield_Park"]}
