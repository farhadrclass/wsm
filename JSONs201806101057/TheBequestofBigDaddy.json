Despite this very kind consideration I give my candid opinions below.As the book begins we meet Big Daddy, an irascible and taciturn old man who would as soon tell someone to \"F*** Off\" as look at them. Big Daddy is a beast of a man with a huge progeny because of a life of casual infidelity to every woman he's ever been with. The balance of the book explains this horrid man's history and how he got to the man he turned out to be.On the positive side, Costa gives us in Big Daddy a wonderfully disgusting and controversial character. His opportunism and disregard for anyone but himself is infuriating in many ways but as we are told more of his history we begin to understand why he became the insufferable brute that he is. Clearly Big Daddy was an ass of major proportions but given the situation he was put into by fate, one couldn't really expect much better. The author gives us a great rendering of a rather hateful character and a delightfully dark history to boot. His supporting cast is also wonderfully vivid with unapologetic portrayals of former slaves in the post-war South.On the negative, Costa's writing does sometimes suffer from a few problems with continuity as I found myself flipping back to try to piece together some event that had taken place without any proper introduction. Also, bracketing the narrative of Big Daddy we have the story of Jo-Dee, one of his modern-day descendants who is looking back and getting to know her frightful long-lost ancestor. She makes an appearance narrating the end of Big Daddy's life in the first chapter and appears again in the last chapter describing her unearthing of family history. Frankly, the beginning and ending chapters detract from the story that one really wants out of this book. They introduce a level of soft and gauzy mysticism and \"magic\" to the story that makes for a rather unpleasant non sequitur.In summary, loved the bits of the book centering on Big Daddy but, like a cigar, the whole thing would have been more enjoyable with the end cut off. There's a seed of a great story here if only one can remove the husk.PS: It is my endeavor to provide reviews that are succinct, honest, balanced and above all help the potential reader to answer the simple question, \"Do I want to read this or not?\" Any feedback you can provide about how you feel I have accomplished those goals (or not) is immensely appreciated."}, {"userName": "Michael Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4779177-michael-murphy", "userReview": "Jo-Ann Costa\u2019s debut historical novel skillfully weaves a vivid tapestry through generations across the South. Costa takes readers on a colorful ride from pre-Civil War Georgia, the war and reconstruction and through the first half of the twentieth century. Her literary style paints characters as solid and vivid as the red clay of Georgia. The Bequest of Big Daddy is an epic tale of sex, murder, revenge, and passionate ambition readers will long remember.The story begins when eight year old Jo-Dee Janson meets her larger-than-life great-great grandfather, Ratio (Big Daddy) Janson. The encounter and a conversation overheard at his funeral four days later, sets in motion a mission that dominates her life. Jo-Dee\u2019s quest to learn about the family patriarch uncovers shocking details of Big Daddy\u2019s colorful life and countless buried family secrets. Ratio is born a child of decaying Southern aristocracy before the Civil War. With a father missing in the war and a beautiful self-indulgent mother adjusting to life\u2019s disappointments, Ratio Janson becomes inquisitive young boy. His childhood independence is shattered by a brutal assault that changes his life forever. Driven by revenge, Ratio and his mother grow apart. As a young man he\u2019s accused of rape, but escapes certain death. Over the years he plots revenge against two men who\u2019ve ruined his life. He seeks wealth and happiness, but after killing a man, Ratio is sent to prison. Only after he escapes, does he begin to acquire the life he\u2019s sought. As the decades pass, Ratio becomes Big Daddy, financially independent, feared and influential, but love and happiness elude him to his death.As Joe-Dee\u2019s quest comes to an end, she understands Big Daddy like no one else in the large southern family. Her final act is the discovery of Big Daddy\u2019s long lost treasure which she buries along with his biggest family secret."}, {"userName": "Audra (Unabridged Chick)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3083001-audra-unabridged-chick", "userReview": "Spanning 1843 through 1981, this novel follows the Janson family, through Jo-Dee Janson Cipriano (a fictional take on the author, Jo-Ann Costa, I presume), a young woman fascinated by her great-grandfather, Big Daddy -- Horatio 'Ratio' Gage Janson. Rude, unruly, wild, downright 'randy' (according to her mother), Jo-Dee knows Big Daddy only as a wizened old man on the verge of death. His passing prompts her to seek out the truth of his story, propelled by a curiosity to know just how bad, how wild, and how randy he really was.In proper gothic tradition, the circumstances of Big Daddy's birth are shrouded in secrecy and lies. His mother, the stunningly gorgeous and staggeringly selfish Mina Satterley is a Southern belle forced into exile from her family's plantation with the arrival of the Civil War. Her husband, sweet Clay Man Janson, besotted with her since a boy, has become a soldier and is presumed dead, unloved by Mina and unknown by Ratio. Mina has taken up with an Alabama senator for her keep, a man who loathes Ratio but offers employment to keep the boy out of trouble. Charmed, perhaps, with a good luck amulet from a childhood incident with the circus, Ratio manages well -- but still gets himself into trouble with the surety of a compass finding north.Some of the characters -- Ratio primary -- are hard to like. They're cruel, mean, rude, ignorant, violent, selfish -- but they are fascinating. Like a car accident or a sordid argument, you can't look away -- and really, why look away? Costa has a sharp sense of her characters and the appeal of a sordid, tangled drama, but I occasionally found the writing clunky. I preferred the historical sections as the more contemporary ones rang a tad awkward. I also have to confess that the use of dialect in dialogue was off-putting and distracting for me; I appreciate the desire to indicate a different style of speaking, but as all her white Southern characters speak grammatically correct English, it was noticeable that the slaves and freed people of color all spoke something more muddled and broken.Still, there's a lovely kind of spoken rhythm to the story -- mimicking in some ways the storytelling that we see happen in the book, as happens at the Janson's reunion in 1981, relatives replaying and rehashing their shared familial memory -- and the reader is invited into that circle. If you like tawdry Southern family drama that steers toward Capote-meets-Leonard rather than V.C. Andrews, this is your book."}, {"userName": "Maureen Timerman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3840941-maureen-timerman", "userReview": "Big Daddy aka Horatio \u201cRatio\u201d Janson story begins before he was born.

We meet Jo-Dee and her father as they are what turns out to be the final visit to Horatio \"Ratio\" Gage Janson also known as Big Daddy, who is essentially on his deathbed. A few weeks later he dies and we meet several of the extend family at the funeral, and when inquisitive Jo-Dee overhears something at the funeral it sets her on a journey of finding answers, and knocking a few proverbial skeletons out of Big Daddy's closet, but will she share what she or allow family secrets to remain just that a secret? It isn't often that I read a book where the author's writing has me laughing within the first few pages but \"The Bequest Of Big Daddy\" did just that. Now let me say, that this isn't a comedy by any stretch of the word, but it was the way the author allowed me to see and hear things thru the eyes and ears of Jo-Dee that was funny. Some of the comments that she repeated that her mother Kate made about \"Big Daddy' was just over the top funny. I would have to say southern fiction is one of my favorite genres to read, and when the story takes us back in time, especially around the time period of the civil war it's even better. I really felt like Jo-Ann Costa did an amazing job of pulling us back to the mid 1800's , her descriptive writing brought the historical aspects as well as the contemporary portions of the story to life.As \"Big Daddy's\" story unfolded he became a larger than life figure for me, I could easily envision him.Overall, interesting characters, a southern flavor, along with an intriguing story made this a top notch read for me, and I think anyone who enjoys historical southern fiction with a bit of mystery, that also deals with family issues will enjoy \"The Bequest of Big Daddy \" as well. On a scale of one to five I would easily give this one a six, because it's just that good!"}, {"userName": "Pamela (Lavish Bookshelf)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2996699-pamela-lavish-bookshelf", "userReview": "Written in the vein of the famous Southern novels, The Bequest of Big Daddy is a debut novel that is as inviting as those wide Southern porches. From the very first page, Jo-Ann Costa's writing reeled me into this story. The characters are larger than life, especially the patriarch they call Big Daddy. Ruling the family even from beyond the grave, Big Daddy is a totally flawed nasty foul-mouthed man whose life was filled with more than one life-altering secret.The Bequest of Big Daddy travels through time from the 1840s to the 1980s as Big Daddy's entire lineage is explored and explained. For my tastes, the chapters written about the Civil War era seemed to be more interesting and enthralling. I didn't relate to the great-granddaughter Jo-Dee as a character as much as I understood the larger-than-life Big Daddy.  Which isn't to say that Big Daddy is really all that likable at all. He's really not someone that one would typically think would be able to rule the family seemingly after his death. It was the mystery of his life that was compelling. Consequently, the mystery of whether Jo-Dee will reveal those secrets decades later is also just as compelling. Like all good Southern novels, The Bequest of Big Daddy relies on deep characters with more than a few skeletons in the closets. It's a book with a dark mystery and a family with strong southern ties. Parts of the book are difficult to like, however Jo-Ann Costa has created a story that's difficult to forget.Rating: 4.5 of 5 starsI received this book complimentary in exchange for an honest review but the opinions in this review are all mine."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13303873-shannon", "userReview": "The Bequest of Big Daddy offers the reader a magnificent peek into the workings of a Southern family patriarch. Big Daddy is one of those swearing, fear inspiring relatives many of us who have been raised in the South remember with both nostalgia and regret. Big Daddy was born Horatio \u201cRatio\u201d Janson and lives many more lives than one. He experiences parental neglect, is wrongfully charged with a heinous crime, experiences the love of a good wife but ultimately does the unforgiveable. While Big Daddy is inspirational as a survivor of many tempests he is certainly not without horrible faults.I appreciated Costa\u2019s ability to create characters so human and yet so complex. I suppose the ultimate compliment would be that several of the characters found within The Bequest of Big Daddy truly brought to mind several members of my family as I remembered them from childhood. Costa vividly brings to life the tension, turmoil, triumph and tragedy of the Deep South from Reconstruction to the present day.I found The Bequest of Big Daddy an engaging read and enjoyed the novel initially as a look into the history of the South but primarily as an exquisitely crafted character study. I would recommend The Bequest of Big Daddy without hesitation.In full compliance with FTC Guidelines, I received a free trade paperback edition of this book from the author and Historical Fiction Virtual Book Tours in exchange for a fair and honest review.

Books set in the South always fascinate me because that region typically sets up to feel like a different world. This one was no exception. The Bequest of Big Daddy was not exactly a fast read, but it did hold my attention. The story opens and closes with a modern day character who is determined to dig into the past of her deceased Great Grandfather. The reader is then transported back through time from the Civil War up through the 1960s. Big Daddy is a glorious larger-than-life character and Costa paints a picture of him that causes him to leap right off the page. Additionally, bearing witness to a female author creating such a distinctly masculine, rough, man's man type of character was interesting in and of itself. I wonder if the character was based on someone she knew, or a pure figment of her imagination. Either way, she created an incredible character. Parts if the book wandered a bit for my taste, since they didn't seem to relate directly to Big Daddy's story. But, the way the author tied everything together at the end was elegant in its simplicity. Overall I would recommend this book to fans of (loosely) historical fiction, Southern settings, and stories that focus on the explicit development of a single character. Definitely an interesting read, and well worth the time."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7088767-jackie", "userReview": "The Bequest of Big Daddy is a fantastic historical fiction novel. Jo-ann Costa really brings the life of a strong-willed, no-nonsense, rough around the edges southern patriarch to vivid reality. Horatio \u201cRatio\u201d Janson lives such a varied life that it is almost too much for one person to endure. He experiences everything from the scant love of a mother to charges of a heinous crime to the love of a good wife to the conviction of an unforgivable act. Ratio lives to see many women in and out of his bed and many legitimate and illegitimate children through out his life. Most of this story is the illustration of a man who must weather many storms and face many enemies. He comes out of each challenge a harder yet wiser man.Jo-ann Costa\u2019s ability to bring these long forgotten, unless seen in movies, characters is phenomenal. Her illustration of the deep south in a time of turmoil and change for both white and black people brings to mind the movie Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. The larger than life Ratio is a character that epitomizes this life and era. Overall, one of the best historical fiction books I\u2019ve read in a while.

Author Jo-Ann Costa takes her readers on quite a fascinating journey through time as she tells the story of the Jansen family from the beginning of the Civil War to present time.This story is a very frank, often very gritty look at one man's battle to establish himself and his family in times that were very rough and very gritty. This is a very mature story with some explicit situations and language, but it lends realism to the story that is very necessary to the plot. The characters are fascinating and the plot moves along quickly, making this novel a lively and quick read.I loved that Ms. Costa took inspiration for this book from her own family's legacy of storytelling.

The Southern family of the Janson clan has Big Daddy, Ratio Janson, at its helm ruling his family with an iron fist. Now that sounds bad and while Big Daddy has a lot of bad habits he\u2019s actually good to those who are family although family also knows to get clear out of his way when the warning signs are there to do so. Big Daddy has a bad temper and it can snap at a moments notice so when Jo-Dee goes with her daddy to visit the aged Big Daddy it is no surprise when he flies off the handle and they have to leave. He passes a few days later and between the funeral and Jo-Dee\u2019s natural curiosity she finds herself under the spell of this Big man who was her great grandfather and this curiosity about him lasts well into her adulthood.The family secrets harbored within this Southern family began generations before Jo-Dee came to be. They started with Ratio and his birth and a mysterious gravestone in the family cemetery. Ratio\u2019s father goes off to war so he\u2019s left to be raised by his mother Mina and she isn\u2019t much of a mother being much too self-centered for mothering. Ratio is left on his own for the most part and really doesn\u2019t have a hard time finding trouble from a young age which finds him in a situation that ultimately changes him. While working in a sawmill Ration gets a little too close to the owner\u2019s daughter and is thrown in a cell to die but Ratio is much too smart for that and finds a way to escape. From this point on he meets his first wife and has quite a few kids but Ratio also has a wandering eye and it isn\u2019t long before that eye and his bad temper lead him to do something he can\u2019t fix easily. He ends up being sentenced to hard labor but even that doesn\u2019t really stop him and eventually he is free. Of course Ratio doesn\u2019t do anything the normal way so he takes advantage of the black markets going strong after the Civil War and makes his fortune all the while keeping a close eye on his ever growing family.While not an honest man and certainly not the nicest one around when in a temper Ratio was a character that grabbed me from the very beginning. Despite seeming to be such a hard man he also had a softer side that fiercely protected those he loved. He was not a man to be wronged and if he was he exacted his revenge no matter how long it may have taken. Ratio, having been raised by a woman who didn\u2019t show him affection had a hard time showing it himself and yet he loved his family. He arranged a family reunion on July 4 of 1908 which was the anniversary of meeting his first wife Eugenie and he held fast to all those in the family attending every year. While I was horrified and shocked by some of the things that Ratio did I felt that his beginnings had a lot to do with where he went in life. What direction would his life had taken if he had love instead of neglect?As the novel slides into 1981 we find Jo-Dee all grown up and still just as curious as she ever was to know more about this man everyone called Big Daddy. After the annual family reunion she sets out to find out what she can about this mysterious grave and man who has so occupied her thoughts. Many things come to light on her trip and secrets are unburied but what will she do with these secrets? Ultimately she knows she can\u2019t destroy her family with them but for Jo-Dee this journey brought her closer to the man who had been Big Daddy.This was a great read for me and one I would recommend to those of you who like Southern tales as well as family dramas. Big Daddy was such a dominating force but there were many characters in this novel from big to small who are also well fleshed out and intriguing. The author Jo-Ann Costa writes in such a way that she fully draws you into the drama of her story and holds you there.

Who was Big Daddy? Was he truly born mean and profane as family legend painted him or was there something more to the man? Jo-Dee's search began because of attending Horatio \"Ratio\" Janson's funeral in 1953.  Big Daddy swore with a vengeance before it became common, it was just his way to use \"outhouse language\". And he was known for his temper, even shooting off the mailman's hat for waking him from a nap. He was also a womanizer with a \"passel of yard chillin'!\" as one great aunt stated.  Ratio's mother was a spoiled manipulative brat who deserved to be turned over someone's knee and given a major tanning. Perhaps she might have been a half-way decent person with some discipline, but I doubt it. I have to be honest, I personally think if I had met Big Daddy I would have run the other way and never looked back. But this book takes a look at the factors made him into the man he was. But there is too much sex and innuendo for my tastes in books, but I know others won't and don't find this offensive. I found Jo-Dee's search more interesting than the sections that actually dealt with Big Daddy. The people that she interacted with and spoke with were interesting. The truth about her heritage is something that she and her family never suspected, but can she bring this secret to light or protect the family legend so that Big Daddy will remain bigger than life. The Bequest of Big Daddy spans the years before the Civil War and ends with Jo-Dee's search for answers in 1981.

Except that's not quite what I received. Instead Big Daddy was born to a Civil War widow, and while there is a chapter telling the story of his parents during the Civil War, the majority of it takes place afterwards. As for Big Daddy himself, he actually isn't that mean of a person. Yes, he has his vices, and he made some hard choices by circumstance, but deep down I think he's a good guy.There are certain aspects of this book I really enjoyed. I loved the hints of Gone with the Wind throughout. I loved reading about all the crazy situations Big Daddy got himself into, and how he escaped. And individually, there's a lot of subplots I loved.But taken as a whole, I wasn't a fan of how it flowed. There aren't really chapters throughout, instead it's broken up into 7 sections, and I think adding in chapters could have really helped. Also, funny enough, even though I enjoyed the first half more, the second half seemed to read for quicker.I'm still not sure what to make of this book. It wasn't what I expected (nor anything close to what the cover implies), but in some ways I liked it more than I anticipated.

This is definitely a novel that requires the reader to create a family tree just to keep up with all the characters, the affairs and the children. Up until Ratio begins producing children, it's easy enough to keep track of everyone but once I started to discover that he had about 10 children that were known to him (but many more that were unknown), I began to give up on discerning who was who - especially when it got into the great-great grandchildren.

Born to a cold, unloving mother and subjected to abuse growing up, it's clear why Ratio grows up to be the tough, sometimes cruel man called Big Daddy. The majority of the story is set in old South and this was the part of the book I enjoyed the most. Ratio was not a likeable fellow but his story was authentic and captivating. I didn't click with the modern day part of the story. Big Daddy was a legend that seemed to be admired by his family after he died and I just couldn't relate. He was a interesting man for sure but not admirable, at least not to me.My only other quibble with this book was the dialogue. The slaves' speech was so muddled that I could barely read it, yet the white characters spoke almost perfectly clearly. This didn't ring true to me but I'm not a historian so I can't say for sure how people spoke back then.Overall, The Bequest of Big Daddy was an enjoyable read. I think fans of Southern historical fiction will want to read the story of Big Daddy."}, {"userName": "Jean Craig", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17631051-jean-craig", "userReview": "Interesting character studies, but many hard to care about."}], "description": "Ratio Janson, the crusty patriarch with an infamous background and a hair-trigger temper, is reverently referred to as Big Daddy by his family clan.\u00a0His feisty great-granddaughter Jo-Dee overhears shocking gossip at Big Daddy\u2019s funeral and is determined to plumb his murky past, from Reconstruction to the present day.From a vast turpentine industry to the ruins of a decaying plantation with its feudal order a memory, Jo-Dee explores the complex nature of family and self, only to make a startling discovery.\u00a0Will she betray her great-grandfather and disgrace the family name, or will she preserve his shameful secret?And on the ancient grounds of the family mansion destroyed in the Civil War, will Big Daddy\u2019s spirit claim her even from the grave?", "title": "The Bequest of Big Daddy", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16087691-the-bequest-of-big-daddy", "average": 3.85, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389051931l/16087691.jpg", "reviews": 19, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6928251.Jo_Ann_Costa", "name": "Jo-Ann  Costa"}], "type": ["Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16087691-the-bequest-of-big-daddy"]}
