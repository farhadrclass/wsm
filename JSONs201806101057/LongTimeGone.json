(yikes-a-doodle-doo.)sure, he went through hell with gasoline drawers on, but by his own admission, he was the one that bought the ticket for that ride -- triggered in part by his choice to deal with the sudden loss of his then girlfriend christine hinton with heroin instead of therapy. and this was the guy that melissa etheridge chose to borrow a cup of sperm from to have not one but two kids with her then partner julie cypher? they couldn\u2019t find jeff beck or eric clapton or something?i don\u2019t smoke and i don\u2019t even do drugs and this book made me want to stop drinking coffee and eating meat and freaking detox whatever funk i had out of my system, just get it off of me. i just wanted to steam and sauna and take three showers and thank Jesus i never tried heroin. or cocaine. or freebase. or crack. or whatever everybody\u2019s gotta be smoking or snorting these days. whatever.and wow. he and his then girlfriend jan (who was even more strung out than he was) got clean and sober enough to get married and have a kid. i read that and i had to put the book down and when i did, i thought, the human body is a miraculous thing. or as the old black folks down south would say, He\u2019s a wonder-working God.bizarrely enough, i knew all their songs so well that when any particular ditty were mentioned in the book, i could hear it in my head. and i\u2019ve never owned any of their records. even now, i don\u2019t sit around listening to any of their songs. they were on permanent rotation that hardcore on the radio when i was a kid.PS: um, yeah. this is kind of a must-read. especially if you\u2019re a musician and you want to half-way know your rock and roll history."}, {"userName": "Murray", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6091970-murray", "userReview": "At one point, while reading this book in a coffee shop, two policemen sat at a table next to me and I got paranoid.What I liked about \"Long Time Gone\" is the unique way that the story was told, alternating between Crosby's personally written recollections, co-author Carl Gottlieb's third-person accounts where he could lasso in Crosby and place his story in a broader context, and the stories shared by the witnesses. I can't recall reading a book written in this style before, and I thought it worked extremely well.What I didn't like about the book is that it is too long. I know that the life of a junkie is harrowing and repetitive, but there were many sections where I thought \"didn't I already read this?\". I know that drugs are what have defined Crosby's life and career, and if you come at this book simply as a story about a user who reached 'rock' bottom 7 or 8 times, then it works. What was missing from this book is a little more insight into the process of music making. It's not completely absent, as Crosby discusses his career with the Byrds, CSNY, and solo ventures. But whenever Crosby would start to delve deeper into music making, the story would meander back to the drug use. Which, I suppose, is the point of the book: for Crosby, the drugs became more important than the music.David Crosby is a very gifted musician, with a voice that ranks with the likes of Art Garfunkel, Don Henley and Dan Fogelberg. His story is so sad that there is actually happiness and good feelings when he is in jail, away from the drugs that would have killed both him and his wife Jan. The book made me listen to the CSN catalog, along with Crosby's solo work and projects with Graham Nash. Overall, it was worth reading, but the length and repetition made me give it 3 stars (because I can't give 3.5)."}, {"userName": "Amanda R", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11078100-amanda-r", "userReview": "Meh. This was written very shortly after Crosby got out of rehab, so (understandably) he focuses quite a lot on his drug abuse. Now, I enjoy a good addiction/recovery story, but I do not need 200 pages of detailed descriptions of how tricky it is to freebase (or just \"base,\" as the cool kids apparently call it). Especially when the addict in question is David Crosby, who is at least partially responsible for some of my most favorite music in the world. I love the Byrds, I adore CSN/Y, the Crosby/Nash stuff is great, and I even like a lot of his solo stuff. The man can harmonize astoundingly well, and he does that super-tricky middle part that you can't quite pick out but that adds immeasurable depth to the chords. It's not immediately noticeable but it practically defines the CSN sound.So imagine my disappointment when he spends maybe half a page talking about Woodstock and doesn't even mention that CSN played at Altamont, pays no attention to the songwriting processes, and behaves as if songs like \"5D\" and \"Helplessly Hoping\" don't even exist. It was all right in the end, I guess, but could have been so very much better. I was hoping for a discussion of my favorite music, but that is not what I got at all."}, {"userName": "Mary Blye  Kramer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15925729-mary-blye-kramer", "userReview": "I've seen CSN&Y in their various formations many times over a period of 30 years and they've always been one of my all time favorite groups. I was captivated by David's rise to fame and felt sorry for him over his addictions, but came to almost hate him as I read the details and realized I could never imagine such a selfish person. And then I came to understand that SO much of his dysfunction was drug related. He is one lucky man to have the love of so many true friends and one brave and strong individual to kick a habit as horrific as the one he had. This is an old book and I googled him to see how he's doing - he's a trooper and I'll be there to cheer him on at his next concert. The book was brutally honest, well written, and David Crosby is one hell of a guy to have the courage to reveal so much. I cried all the way through the last 30 pages or so - what a happy, happy ending - and a true one!!"}, {"userName": "Kid", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/168793-kid", "userReview": "This is actually a pretty unique and admirable book. It might be one of the earliest versions of the combination autobiography supplemented with bit-player oral history memoir - and for Crosby's truly \"lock him the f' up\" lifestyle - it really works. Basically for a solid 10-15 years of his life \"the Cros\" (as he is called) was chained to the crack pipe. Day by day he was pouring money and talent into the cesspool of umm. . .Dionysus? That's putting too fine a point on a grotesque display of rampant self-indulgence. But yeah - it's a great read - mainly because it's a rare star-memoir that doesn't puff away all the dark stuff. Crosby loves to sail too. . .It's pretty wrong that this man was allowed to be famous - but perhaps he deserved his life which sounds like it was pretty grim."}, {"userName": "Jeaninne Escallier Kato", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24684236-jeaninne-escallier-kato", "userReview": "I have read many rock bios, yet none stand out as seminal as this one. David Crosby holds nothing back regarding his rise and fall from stardom.

While the book details Crosby's life (until publication in 1988), the book includes a LOT of detail about the genesis of CSN and sometimes Y, and also of the times, including the 60s-70s drug scene, which nearly did in Crosby (and his eventual wife, Jan Dance). To be clear, the book has its flaws (for one it could have used a good proof reader), and David Crosby is not s/o that, frankly, I think I'd really like to know, but this was a Herculean task to put together and there is a lot of interesting detail. Not surprisingly the book will likely appeal more to CSN (and sometimes Y) fans, of whom I count my self one; however, I think it's an engrossing read for anyone with an interest in that time period and the beginnings of \"classic\" rock and roll."}, {"userName": "Glen Demers", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859985-glen-demers", "userReview": "Written soon after he got out of prison, got married and got sober, this book spends a lot of time on his descent into drug addiction. I would have preferred more stories about his early days with the Byrds & CSN.It's an interesting autobiography in that Crosby's voice is set differently from that of his co author, who provides historical context, and also from the frequent comments and stories from people in his past.

In a sense, the story is close to me although I've never met him, while having interacted and been friends and acquainted with some of the folks, places and objects mentioned. This is the third of his books that I've read, working backward chronologically from the last to the first.Well, I love the personal take on the music, and the music biz, (especially the free agent stuff because I intuitively gravitated toward that as an indie, of course not on the mega level that he was dealing with and the pressure of that . . . and I used to get it big time from Fuzz too, which I didn't understand at first, although I was quite familiar with Pete Seeger's independent status regarding recording contracts as a means to combat censorship . . . and I always enjoyed the freedom with my projects), also the names and places, the scene, and then, you know, getting old is not for the faint of heart . . . they say, and I think it's true. I did freebase once, but I'm such a light weight, first off, never cared that much for cocaine, until a friend brought back a load of coca leaves from Peru, and I think they were mixed with Ayahuasca because I got really tripped out after I ate them. So, at the time that I tried that base, around 1980/79ish, I was living in Coral Gables, working off debt at the dealer's house, bunked in, and I was also running two miles a day down at the park near Sailboat Bay, the figure eight track, well I got one mile into the run when my chest froze up, couldn't breath in or out . . . reckoned I was dying and looked around for a good place to take my rest, a nearby tree looked hospitable enough, quite near the water, but I gamely tried to get some air in my lungs, the sensation was like getting the wind knocked out of you but you weren't 'knocked' by anything . . . hmmm, after I managed to finally get a little air down my gullet . . . maybe it was the freebase?? So I didn't see any reason to repeat that episode again, and that would have had to include the base . . . ;)I had my own kind of hard luck and trouble in Miami, good times too. Fuzz took me 'round to Fred Neil's house back in '78 and Elliot's office a couple of years ago, and then took me to the session he did with Chris in Santa Barbara . .. and I pitched a song that Slick played guitar on, circa 1984 at Bayshore with Buddy Thornton, to Chris through the engineer at West Studio . . . I don't know, maybe I can help someone, including myself.Oh yeah, and I was at the Town Hall gig around then too, standing next to Art Garfunkle in the wings. I got there early around sound check, said I was a friend of Fuzzy's and was allowed backstage. I particularly remember the piano piece and the thing about wanting to turn right, but going left, also reiterated in the book. The piano piece was pristine, don't remember if you were singing but I was standing right behind the piano and you looked up and smiled at me as you tickled the last note.

I picked up the book because I was interested in his time in The Byrds, and this is covered fairly well.After The Byrds broke up, he became a founding member of the super group, 'Crosby, Stils, Nash, and Young' which took off at nearly the same time that his drug habit spiraled out of control. He certainly makes the case that 'free basing' cocaine takes addiction to an entirely new level. A large part of the book focuses on his harrowing descent into abject drug addiction, and then his incarceration in the Texas prison system for drug and weapons possession. Here he is able to reform his life, and put his drug addicted past behind him. It's an interesting read, and I found him not to be a very likable person, but certainly one of the most talented song writers and vocalists of the 60's."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1206706-amy", "userReview": "I am a huge fan of David Crosby's music. Suffice it to say if you are not, you may not enjoy this book as much as I did. It contains everything you would expect from a \"rock bio\", from sexual escapades to heart-breaking and career breaking drug use and prison time. He remembers enough of the sixties to really let you in on what it was like to experience it, and what he doesn't is relived honestly in the voices of his friends. What sets it apart, in my opinion, is David's non-narcissistic and candid approach. He has an absolutely endearing personality and thankfully has come through the other side as a warm, caring, responsible, incredibly wise and still talented musician and activist. If you can read this without falling in love with David Crosby and not humming \"Southern Cross\" while you catalogue all your folk and classic rock cd's, then you are much less of a sap than me."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7891107-barb", "userReview": "The story of one of the most influential bands of the 1960s and 70s, this is a brutally honest account of the singers life, loves and vices. A charter member of the generation of sex, drugs and rock-and-roll, Crosby indulged unstintingly in all of the above.Crosby is a combination of many traits: a good friend and fair weather lover; a talented musician and drug addicted idler; a man who fell in and out of love with the ease of the true artist. We see him in all his glory and shame, culminating with his close brush with death and new found maturity and happiness.

Remarkable similarities between the two -- time period, extravagance + excess, addiction and recovery -- but at heart I'm more interested in Crosby's scene (West Coast beats begetting folk-rock, country-rock, and rock-rock), and he tells his story with a little more reflection and scope. His downward spiral is riveting, until it becomes overwhelming, at which point a couple weeks ago I put the book down, but was prompted to pick it up after finishing Keef's Life. Where Life is anecdotal, without much concession to narrative, Long Time Gone feels bigger than Crosby's life. Idealism and stoned good times in the 60s give way to paranoia and isolation in the 70s.
