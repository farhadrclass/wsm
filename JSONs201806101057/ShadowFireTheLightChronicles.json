You know the games where you get online with tons of other players and you can kill monsters with your guild or pvp (player vs player) with other factions? Well I love those games! So when I began to read this book, and noticing all of these weird creatures, the reference to guilds, mages, mercenaries AND shape shifters it struck me! If there was a book written about the MMO games that I enjoy, this would be similar to it.... So with that being said let me begin.There are a lot of surprises in this book and I enjoyed them! The fighting scenes were fun and very detailed. And the creatures! They are so weird! Goblins, basilisks (lizard type things), hydrangas (evil plant monsters), wolf boar things, and of course..... rabid bunnies.... yes, rabid bunnies with fangs! Like Indiana Jones? Then you will definitely love this one. This book was so fun to read ! I was excited about the surprises contained within hoping it would take the story in a different direction. When Ashlyn discovers a truth about one of her companions as she first starts her journey with Zane, I was let down a bit. She was upset, but she didn't really act surprised. It just fell flat for me. Also, when Zane tells her a truth about his life, something that is very important, she acted like she already knew and then it was just over. I was just hoping for a bit more out of that. There is so much adventure and even though I loved reading about it, I just felt that the problems were so easily taken care of. These were major problems and they were solved with nominal acts.I love Ashlyn. She is beautiful and she is strong. Zane is a mercenary and is hired to protect Ashlyn on her mission. I loved that Zane fell instantly head over heels for Ashlyn. They are sweet together and very romantic. They fall for each other so fast that the build up to a relationship is non existent. Ashlyn finds him attractive and then three days later they are a couple in love.A lot of books just focus on either adventure or the romance. Adding a little of the other, depending on the authors preference for their story. This book focuses on both. You have an equal amount of adventure and romance. It was fun!So, MMO games, Indiana Jones and a lot of kissing...... if you love those, then you'll love Shadow Fire!I will leave you with this quote from Zane....\"One last piece of advice...stop undressing her with your eyes unless you wish to become better acquainted with my sword!\" Yes Zane... you may kill for me... *swoons*"}, {"userName": "Emilia Grant", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28756211-emilia-grant", "userReview": "Rating: 0.5 / 5I received this book for free from the author in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.Review:It is a rare occasion for me to not finish a book. It has happened so few times, that I can actually count them on one hand. This is one of those rare occasions, where I forced myself to stop the torture about twenty pages shy of the end. I tried. I really did. But when a book drags so much you can\u2019t bear to read more than ten pages a day without getting annoyed and having to stop to calm yourself, you know it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s the book.At first Shadow Fire left a very positive impression on me. The cover with the wolf in the shadows was pretty and the determined stare of the girl in front of it led me to believe that this book would be featuring a strong heroine who does not take any crap from anyone.Sadly, I was disappointed almost immediately.Whilst the book started out quick paced and with a purpose and the first thirty pages were quite an interesting read, as soon as Ashlyn embarked on her journey with Zane, the plot started dragging. Their quest became secondary and the primary focus of the next two hundred pages was Ashlyn and Zane sucking face, proclaiming their love for each other, having jealousy fits and, above all, them not being able to move past second base, since Ashlyn needed to stay pure for the quest.Along the way and in order to disrupt their make out sessions a few monsters appeared, which the duo always managed to take care of immediately, without so much as a bruise on their part. It got old after the third time. This is actually one of the things that bothered me the most about this book. The main characters faced obstacles in every single chapter. As soon as an obstacle appeared, though, they took care of it in a matter of two pages \u2013 tops. There was one, I think, which they needed more pages to overcome, but I am not going to elaborate on that, since I would have to include spoilers. However, I am going to say this: even that problem \u2013 which in my eyes was quite a serious one \u2013 they managed to take care off surprisingly easily. I realize that it is fiction, and even more so, it is a fantasy book, but some plausibility would not have hurt.And whilst I am on the topic of plausibility, I would like to comment on the language used. This book is supposedly set at some point in the Dark/Middle Ages. Yet, apart from the word \u201cdastard\u201d, which is used what feels like a hundred times, the characters speak modern English. Really modern English. Sometimes even argot, really. It threw me off quite a few times and I had to check myself to make sure I wasn\u2019t losing it and the words and expressions I thought I read were really there. They were. To me the language used by the characters of a book is part of the world building and of the process of making the story fit the setting and vice versa. Well, that obviously didn\u2019t happen here.The world building was kept to a minimum in general. Apart from the very beginning, where we get to experience under what circumstances Ashlyn had lived for so many years, what her responsibilities were and how the elders of her village operated, there wasn\u2019t much more to it. We didn\u2019t get any description of the society the story takes place in, how other people live, why all those animals have turned into monsters, how dark and light magic was created, how it works (Apparently everyone is a natural at using magic. If you close your eyes and picture it, it will happen.), what role the gods played\u2026 really, there are a thousand things that go unanswered, many of them essential for a better understanding of a story and capable of actually making the book worth your while\u2026 if they had only been elaborated on.I did not sign up to read three hundred pages of people sucking face over and over. I signed up for the adventure, the mystery, the action\u2026 all of which was missing.Also, I have this thing where I despise needy and co-dependant characters. Ashlyn is all bark no bite. Whilst at the beginning of the book she still had some backbone, making difficult decisions, sacrificing herself for the greater good and doing what was expected of her, she soon lost herself in Zane and his muscular arms. And those must have been a hell of a pair of arms and chest! Women back then would not have dared act the way Ashlyn did around Zane after knowing him for two days around their husband of two years! Not even in private. Not to mention all this PDA in front of strangers! Cue: eye-roll.Seriously, I kept thinking Ashlyn is easier than a hooker on crack. If it wasn\u2019t for the quest and Zane reminding her of it, she would have let him take her that second day in front of all the people who happened to walk by. And to think that virtue used to be the most prized possession of an unmarried woman back then\u2026Zane on the other hand was sweet and cute and protective and just oh-so cheesy. He could have substituted for a fondue. I kept rolling my eyes at everything he said. No-one is that nice and understanding all the time.To round it up I would like to say that this book had potential. In the beginning it sure gave the impression of a nice read. Sadly, it went downhill from there pretty fast. I won\u2019t be reading the next books of the series \u2013 I might go back to read the remaining five pages of the last chapter and the epilogue, though.

Thank you Kimber Leigh Wheaton for the opportunity!This book started out as an adventure as Ashlyn set off on an impossible mission to recover a stolen goddess statue with Zane the mercenary by her side. It was very clear from the beginning that there was an attraction between the two and that we would be in for a good romance. Little did I know that it would be a whole lot more.As the two pursue their quest we are introduced to unusual creatures, magic and evil sorcerers. This is where I need to back up a little bit. It is these types of stories that can be hit or miss for me. A story has be written just so in order for me to enjoy a plot that takes me away from something that could actually happen in real life. I have to say that Wheaton did just that. She penned the story in a way that had me believing the story and wanting to know more. I wasn't shaking my head at the unusual events because she was able to find a perfect balance to make the story flow. By the half way point the story was off and running at full steam with twists and turns that kept me glued to the pages.I enjoyed Ashlyn's character because she was not a weak and needy girl. She had a strong will and the ability to defend herself to some degree. Zane was also extremely likeable. Not only were his physical characteristics pleasing but his personality and kind heart were equally so. The two together were a joy to read. There was a ton of chemistry to go along with the budding romance but it was kept clean enough that it is appropriate for readers of any age.Over all I have to say that a really enjoyed the book and I will definitely be reading the rest of The Light Chronicles when it comes out."}, {"userName": "D'eBook  Sharing", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11568171-d-ebook-sharing", "userReview": "***I received a gift copy from the author in exchange for an honest review***'Shadow Fire' is the first book in a new series from Kimber Leigh Wheaton. It's target audience is YA and I would recommend it to anyone that likes the YA genre.Every five years a girl aged between 14-18 is chosen to be sent on a dangerous quest to recover the Goddess Statue. So far, none of the Chosen have been successful. Now, the time has come for someone to undertake the quest once again. 17 year old Ashlyn has had the unfortunate luck of being the Chosen. She sets off with her two companions, Zane and Shadow. Another companion, Freya, later joins this little crew.The Companions: Zane, Shadow & Freya: Zane is the good looking mercenary that joins Ashlyn to protect her as she undertakes the quest that has been offloaded onto her.Shadow has been Ashlyn's friend ever since he was a small cub. He's extremely intelligent and understands pretty much everything that's asked of him.Freya, is, well, you'll meet Freya for yourself when you read the book :DI quite enjoyed Ashlyn's feisty character but I enjoyed it even more because she wasn't painted as just a Kick Ass Heroine. Her vulnerable side also gets to be seen which, in my opinion, makes her character more believable. The story is quite a good one and introduces scenarios and characters that both help and hinder Ashlyn and her companions as they make their way to the Breven Ruins. It also has a few little twists that were enjoyable.I did find the last major fight scene a bit of a disappointment, I was expecting a little more action.I'd really like to read the rest of this new series to see what else Kimber Leigh Wheaton can bring to the table.4 Shamrocks with the hopes of reaching 5 Shamrocks with the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Farrah", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5705696-farrah", "userReview": "A sweet, light, and enjoyable read, Shadow Fire was a wonderful YA fantasy romance. I loved this book! With super sweet romance and a dangerous quest, this book was a delight. Loved it!Ashlyn was a wonderful heroine. She was strong, clever, and could fight with the best of them. And, she was very determined when she set her mind to something. I thought she was a lovely, likable character.Zane was absolutely adorable. He was a formidable opponent, yet he could be so very sweet. I loved how he was very loyal to those he loved and what he believed in and how he was a genuinely kind man. He was amazing and I totally loved him.The romance was super sweet. Ashlyn and Zane were just wonderful together. Their romance was the type to leave a smile on your face. And, though this is definitely a clean romance, there was enough chemistry to turn up the heat.I liked the secondary characters, as well. I loved the dashing and charming pirate that we meet later in the book and I liked how the animals (a wolf and a griffon) were treated as individual characters, especially because both were animals of complete intelligence. They were all great.The plot was fast paced and I was hooked the entire way through. I really enjoyed the story and the ending was lovely. This might not be an earth-shattering read, but it was fun, entertaining, and an utter delight.Shadow Fire was a light, sweet, and absolutely fantastic YA fantasy romance. I loved this gem of a read. It was thoroughly engaging and I enjoyed every bit of it. It's a perfect, light book to read when you need a break from the dark and heavy stuff.

I really have no idea where this book is supposed to be set (this world or another, past or future, etc). The language is pretty much on par with today's language, including borrowing from other languages (i.e. viola is French but used with the same meaning in English). Everyone seems to have the same mannerisms, regardless of age or background.My second problem is the feeling of \"insta-love\" between our heroine Ashlyn and Zane. Ashlyn is repeatedly told she's beautiful, from everyone including Zane. While attraction definitely is a huge part of a functional relationship, it never felt like it progressed beyond that. Yes, Zane is a trained and renown mercenary and would probably make anyone feel safe, it didn't feel like enough. I would have liked the author to advance the groundwork of the relationship beyond that. Also, the repeated I'm-in-love-with-your-red-hair was a bit tedious and made Zane lose all personality.BUT, it's a quick, fun read. The action does climax, but honestly was a bit anticlimactic for me. The \"final battle\" just felt too easy. Again, this is targeted at a YA audience, so the younger side of that should be fine with this.Ashlyn narrates the entire book in present tense, which worked well for this book.

I decided to give it a try and was sucked in right away. It had a promising start, but I lost interest at about 25%. I figure I could keep reading and be annoyed or just stop now. I like how the story began and it seemed like it'd be the kind of book I'd normally enjoy, but then the insta-love happened and it was just over for me. There was no buildup whatsoever between H/h. They're known each other less than a day and they are already cuddling, holding hands and making out. No tension or chemistry. I can only imagine what the rest of the book will be like. I felt like once Ashlyn started her journey her character did a 180 and lost some of her appeal. I also thought it was a little weird that her first time killing someone was so...blas\u00e9. No real emotion, you'd think something like that would affect you. Instead she just makes out with Zane some more. And I just wanted to mention one more thing. This is High Fantasy, which typically has a medieval feel, but the dialogue in this was just off at times and felt too modern, took me out of the story. This could be a good book and I hate not finishing a book once I start, I just can tell I'll be too irritated with this one to continue on.

Ashlyn has been chosen by her village to go on a quest to find an ancient stolen statue that will save her world. She is accompanied by a handsome mercenary named Zane, who vows to protect her at any cost. Together, they face horrible monsters and dark magic on their quest.The negatives:Focus on Zane and Ashlyn. While I really loved Zane and Ashlyn together, I thought the first half of the book focused just a little too much on their growing relationship. They spend most of the first half of the book passionately kissing (and moaning, etc. - and often wishing they could do more - I thought the book was going to head into NA territory sometimes, but the fact that Ashlyn had to remain \"pure\" for their quest kept it all YA appropriate). Since there was no real tension or conflict to their relationship, I actually got a little bit bored with the passionate scenes - I found myself thinking, \"Yep, they like each other (oh, sorry, love each other), and they really like to kiss a lot. Got it. I'm ready to move on.\" Luckily, the second half of the book picked up quite a bit and the true plot got underway. Modern dialogue. For a fantasy story in a somewhat medieval setting, the dialogue in this book occasionally felt a bit too modern. This might be a bit nit-picky, but it took me out of the story from time to time.What I loved:The worldbuilding. I thought that Wheaton created an incredibly intriguing world with its own complex history and magic. I especially loved the inventiveness behind the monsters that Zane and Ashlyn often encountered while on their perilous journey. I also enjoyed the magic element to the story, and loved pretty much any part of the book where magic was the focus.Ashlyn and Zane. Like I said, while my personal preference would have been a little less of a focus on the budding romance between these two in the first half of the book, it's not because I didn't like them - or because I didn't like them together. Ashlyn was a strong character who could take care of herself. She was adept with a bow and arrow and found that she also had a strong magical ability. There were definitely times where she let Zane protect her when she probably didn't need to, but there were plenty of times where she stepped up and saved the day herself. Zane was everything you could wish for in a book boyfriend - strong and handsome and devoted to his paramour, but sometimes vulnerable. And I did appreciate that Wheaton kept her book clean without making her characters seem chaste - this is actually perfect for YA readers. (Characters who show self-control! Yay!)Taranis. This cheeky pirate popped up in the last third or so of the book. At first it seemed that Wheaton was aiming for a love triangle, but luckily things between Ashlyn and Taranis never got beyond flirtatious banter. Taranis was my favorite character in the book - his sometimes goofy antics were refreshing, and he was just an incredibly likable guy (he was sort of a pirate with a heart of gold). I kind of hope that we'll be seeing more of Taranis in future books!The second half. The second half of this book really picked up for me. This is where the plot really thickened and we started to get a sense of real danger and excitement from Zane and Ashlyn's journey. The last third, especially, was full of twists and turns and lots of action and adventure!I think that Shadow Fire is a great choice for YA readers who enjoy fantasy. I love that each installment in this series is a standalone story (no cliffhangers!). I give this book 3.5/5 stars.***Disclosure: This book was provided to me by the author in exchange for an honest review. No other compensation was given.

The journey is extremely dangerous and nobody has ever returned alive. Ashlyn has been chosen and she must go off on her own to complete what is essentially a suicide mission. Luckily though, she doesn't end up totally alone and a mercenary called Zane ends up joining her. For me the plot in Shadow Fire was the best part of the book. At first I thought that the quest would take up the majority of the plot - and it does - but there were lots of little surprises along the way which kept me interested. Essentially, the Goddess Statue belonged to the Goddess but when it was stolen and hidden away monsters began to appear. Each year the monsters grow bolder and stronger, and the Goddess Statue is the only way of counteracting this development. There isn't that much focus on the monsters but along the way on the quest, Ashlyn and Zane encounter a huge variety of creatures. Some I've heard of, others were completely new, but I really enjoyed wondering what was going to happen next and this little twists made the book super fun to read :) . Now for the characters. Ashlyn is a strong young girl and is kind of like Katniss from The Hunger Games in the way that she goes out hunting to provide food and money for her family. Speaking of her family, she has a ton of siblings, and although we only meet them briefly, her relationship with all of them brought a smile to my face. As well as being strong, she's determined and quite capable of taking care of herself. However, there were times when it seemed like although Ashlyn had spent years in the forest - which we're told - she's a bit clumsy; it didn't quite seem to add up at times. But overall I liked her as a character.Anyway, then there's Zane. He's a mercenary who travels from town to town hunting monsters and doing jobs, but when he meets Ashlyn he suddenly decides to join her on her extremely dangerous mission. For the most part I really liked Zane but there was never any real reason for him joining the quest, besides the fact that he though Ashlyn was beautiful and like nobody he'd ever seen before. So I guess there's a hint of insta-love, but it's more like insta-attraction. I have to say that Zane is pretty hot. He's sexy, slightly sarcastic - which I always adore - and super sweet to top it all off. And there were some great moments (a.k.a. kisses) between Ashlyn and Zane that really added to the story (what can I say, I'm a sucker for romance). The only slightly annoying part about their relationship was that they seemed to have a problem with PDA. Like, entirely oblivious to others around them but then engaging in a full-on make-out session; it didn't really bother me since I tended to laugh a bit, though.The pacing in the book is pretty good and it doesn't really drag at all in the middle, although it slows down slightly at the end. My only other minor issue with the book was that it was cheesy at times but the interesting plot made up for those kind of awkward moments. The ending wraps up quite nicely and although there's not an obvious reason for a second book, I would definitely read the sequel!YA4 stars*Thank you to the author for providing me with a copy of the book!"}, {"userName": "Jillian Lopez", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19662190-jillian-lopez", "userReview": "I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.  Review may also be seen in my book blog  Jillian's Books  This book was incredibly adventurous and slightly humorous! Not to mention, though, that some parts slightly didn't come to my likes as well. I loved the plot, the fact that there were mythological creatures everywhere! It was pure fantasy! It was like living in a whole new universe entirely different from our own. And that's what I absolutely loved about the book. It was like reading another Percy Jackson book because there were lots of heroism and fantasy contained within the 300 pages of this book. Growing up, I've loved Percy Jackson. This book was good!What didn't come to my likes? There was too much romance in it. Sure, I have grown to love romance novels such as The Summer trilogy by Jenny Han. I love the fact that characters in novels just fall in love despite the circumstances and then I would end up bawling in the end. But - I'm really sorry of having to say this - there was just too much in this novel that I caught myself sighing instead. I wanted to take a break from all those lovey-dovies, but it showed up in every chapter which makes me tired! I wanted more adventures!There was too much kissing and moaning + groaning and \"exploring the mouth\" thing. I just wanted more of the fantasy from this book!Also, I was quite surprised because after 30+ pages, there was already intense kissing. My initial thought about this was: \"Wooow! That escalated quickly.\" And this continued throughout the entire novel. Shocking!!Apart from the things that didn't come to my interests, I have to say that this book is amazing. Wonderful story line, impressive narration, valiant characters, and such a beautiful, beautiful fantasy world. I also liked how the story ended. I have been a fan of happy endings ever since the Disney Princesses started it like 10 years ago (?) so it really got me smiling. I loved the main plot of the book! It just made the whole novel more exciting!Would I recommend it? Yes, I would still recommend it. It's the story that drives me forward.

In the beginning, I was admiring the writing style but really thought, \"Okay - I get it - another 'Hunger Games'.\" I wasn't too happy about that, because (and PLEASE no hate mail), I wasn't all that crazy about \"Hunger Games.\" I know, I know \"Hunger Games' is the bomb - its awesome - its the rapture - WELL, sorry - it wasn't for me. I like my heroines a little more damaged - or so I thought. Ashlyn changed all that.The red-haired main character, Ashlyn is a little spitfire, as well as \"The Chosen One\" - slated to be the next to take one for the team in a long line of ill-fated virgins (naturally) sent out in search of a mystical statute belonging to a goddess. But Ashlyn had something none of the rest of the poor dead (and deprived) suckers had: a hunk of burning love named Zane, who used his skills (of which there were many) to wage war against the walls surrounding Ashlyn's heart AND against all who dared threaten them on their way.. The titian-haired huntress was a darn good shot and quite handy with a knife and bow, but in a battle against monsters - a big ol' hunter with some tricks up his sleeve certainly came in handy. I won't tell you about the end, you'll have to read it yourself - but it was well-written as it was satisfying.I thought the writing was strong; it had me turning the pages quickly to see what would happen next. The characters were engaging and the dialogue well-written. The book did not waste space with endless descriptions and I liked that, too. The author chose to keep it clean, so I feel perfectly comfortable recommending \"Shadow Fire\" to my 13-year-old niece and my 73 year old mother. If you are looking for a deep, life-changing read - the author probably has one in her, but this isn't it.

Shadow Fire, by Kimber Leigh Wheaton, is a snappy, sassy, sweet, all-that-kind-of-awesome-and-then-some YA read. I couldn't put it down. Okay, so let's start with the cover: How gorgeous is it? It's beautiful, eye-catching, pretty in the way you want to pet it (or the black wolf, at least). Kudos to the cover artist/s. They did a knock out job creating a cover that after reading Shadow Fire, captured the essence of it. Onto the novel itself. Where do I begin? The author did an incredible job creating a fresh story in a genre that's been there and done that. The writing style was creative, well done, and descriptively just right. Shadow Fire was a fast paced read full of adventure, suspense, twists, turns, and romantic tension. The main character, Ashlyn, is the Chosen One, not a role I would be signing up for any time soon, but when I think of mercenary swoon-worthy Zane, on second thought, I just might! Ashlyn has her work cut out for her, a job that's sure to fail (no pressure there) and it's a race against time to save her people and her heart. The quest Ashlyn and Zane are on together is a wonderful journey for the reader as well. I highly recommend Shadow Fire to those in search of something fun, suspenseful, with the right ratio of romance. The only disappointment was when Shadow Fire ended.

It was fun, fast paced, action packed and romantic. Kimber Leigh creates a wonderful and magical realm with it's mythical creatures that's so easy to get lost in, trust me I did and I enjoyed every minute. There is nothing that I like more in a story than a strong female character. The heroine of the book, Ashlyn, who is also the \"Chosen One\" is definitely that girl. She is brave, not afraid to get her hands dirty, and she can kick butt. I also admire the love and loyalty she has for her family. Then there is Zane the handsome Mercenary. He is protective, kind, fierce, a skilled fighter and definitely the guy to sweep Ashlyn off her feet. Though I must admit his red eyes were a little creepy. The romance between Zane and Ashlyn was very sweet and endearing. They had some really wonderful moments with each other.The ending was nice and it left the characters in a good place. But I do think there is more to come and I am curious to see where the story goes next.Review also posted at: http://jesstimetoread.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Keeley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28063908-keeley", "userReview": "I received this book directly from the author in exchange for an honest review.Shadow fire is a magical, exiting read that had me turning the pages!

Okay, let's start with the cover It's very beautiful and very eye-catching.  Now I must divied the story to 2 parts:  At the first part of the book- (approximly till page 160)  The story itself has a promising quality to it. But here is my problems - I really love badass heroines. those ladies that don't need to hide behind a man for protection. Ashlyn has the potential for this, she know how to hunt, she had a training in martial arts and according to the author she suppose to be good in both of them, but at the first trouble she is behaving lie a damsel in distress. Secondly - Her reaction to the temple site - was defiantly unreliable...But the floor\u2026 the bloodstained stone floor captures my attention. They didn't bother to clean up after the remains of the Shrine Maidens were removed. Small pieces of flesh and bone are strewn among the blackened pools of dried blood. My hand flies to my mouth to hold in the scream trying to escape...\" As a huntress she should be used to see flash and blood without getting distressed about it. For the description itself you could think that the attack in the temple happened a few days ago... only bones and dust should be left after 25 years. The author should explain her distress differently. Third - The descriptions - of the other characters tend to be some how flat. It is also hard for me that descriptions of the physical treats, like color of eyes and hair, repeat on them self too many times , like the author wasn't sure that the reader didn't caught them on the first time. Personally it give me the feeling that the story not flowing freely. For the plot In short -  Ashlyn golden eye and red long hair, is a young heroine \"Chosen\" to make a dangerous journey to find a relic that would save her homeland. The previous Chosens never returned home. She is forced to say goodbye to her family and begin her mission to retrieve the relic. Fortunately, she will not be alone. A dashingly handsome mercenary,  Zane Elistaire, Auburn hair and red eyes. Has some handy, healing powers that he inherit from his mom. Zane has been hired to accompany her on her quest. Once they set out on their journey, Ashlyn and Zane run into monsters, pirates, bandits, magical creatures, an evil sorcerer, and much more. Zane and Ashlyn. - there was undefinable attraction. While I really loved them together, the first half of the plot focused a little too much on their relationship. They spend most of the first half of the book passionately kissing (and moaning, etc.) but the fact that Ashlyn couldn't punch her V- card yet for the quest kept it all YA appropriate. There was no tension or conflict in the relationship, which made the the passionate scenes little bit boring. Luckily, the second half of the book picked up quite a bit and the true plot got underway.  So.after all above it sere as a good explanation why ....The story start and progresses slowly to my like. Shadow - a fenrir wolf, not many left of his kind. Smart and awesome character. For some unfathomable reason, Shadow's ferocious presence can calms horses.Shadow very good in guarding and catching breakfast for Ashlyn and Zane,  Freya - griffin (her name connected to the Norse myth) .green-hued eyes. feathered wings, leonine body; the creature's large beak and talons. It is she and she became a good friend with Shadow. Delistaire -an evil sorcerer and Zane's father. He used to control Zane's mom with a crystal and the one who responsible to her death by accusing her as a magic user. He did so because she fail to heal his mistress. He has a long dark straight brown hair and red eyes. The Norse mythology - here and there touches of mythology that added another layer to the story. Loki (He suppose to be the trickster - not the good guy) and his mother the goddess Rieki. Loki emitting glow like a blue halo of light. Long shimmering white hair falls down to his waist . azure eyes, pointed ears and long white tail - this description remind me immediately one of my favorite manga hero Inuyasha. Usually appeared to Ashlyn as a white wolf. The Monsters - A really unique monsters that Ashlyn and Zane had to fight on their quest, They have a tendency to appear one after another without giving to our heroes enough time ti recover, felrik - Has red eyes. They're a strange cross between a wolf and a boar\u2026 so in the most basic terms, a vicious wolf with giant sharp tusks and serious territorial tendencies.  goblars slick glistening green skin, little humanoid goblin-like things with sharp fangs. Despite being stocky, they move with amazing speed. Sometimes armed with short swords. basilisk - scaly and green and izard-like body. hydrangas - odd plant type things with vines dangling from their limbs . the only way to get rid from them is by burning them as their limbs grow back immediately if hacked off. They wrap their vines around their prey and slowly drain the life from it. The harder the prey struggles, the tighter the vines become, until the prey is either suffocated or sucked dry. harrier - rabid bunnies - with scary fangs  Cockatrices - dragon monster with the silly rooster head that can kill with a glare. common in the southern plains  At the second part of the book the pace start to increase, the characters now seams fuller. The author forgot those annoying descriptions that i mention above so the wasn't jumpy anymore. New and interesting characters came to light and over all the potential started to unfold. at the same time we discover that both Ashlyn and Zane can use magic and do it Despite it was forbidden by the law and the punishment was severe - death. Unlike Zane's father which used the magic in an evil way they use for a good causes. Taranis. a pirate who read a cheeky pirate popped up in the last third or so of the book. At first it seemed that Wheaton was aiming for a love triangle, but luckily things between Ashlyn and Taranis never got beyond flirtatious banter. His goofy antics were refreshing, and he was kind of very likable guy, which on their 1st meeting that what he said ti them: ......\"He [lord Noran] wants me to take you to Karina [the island wherer is the mgical statu] . Let's see, you have an evil sorcerer [Zan's father] trying to kill you. Your cargo includes a fenrir[Shadow[ and a griffin. And on top of it all, you want to practice magic aboard my vessel. You don't ask for much, do ya?\".....p.s.I believe that the meaning of the title connected to the main familiars the wolf(shadow) and the griffin(fire)"}, {"userName": "Rachel (The Rest Is Still Unwritten)", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2406353-rachel-the-rest-is-still-unwritten", "userReview": "Thank you to author Kimber Leigh Wheaton for providing me with a copy of this novel to read in exchange for an honest review!Find this review and more on my blog The Rest Is Still Unwritten!Shadow Fire is author Kimber Leigh Wheaton\u2019s superbly addictive debut novel and is an incredibly romantic tale that blends elements of fantasy and magic together with wit, humor and danger.  Let me just begin by saying just how much I enjoyed this book. From the very opening chapter it really was a joy to read with its fun, light storyline that held all the aspects of danger and discovery I could ask for! High on the romance and featuring characters with a fantastic dynamic, Shadow Fire was very well written and told. Kimber Leigh Wheaton has created such an alluring world within it\u2019s pages weaving together different elements of magic with mages, sorcerers and various creatures, some we\u2019ve seen before and others created specifically for this series.  Shadow Fire is told through the eyes of Ashlyn, a simple but brave village girl who is chosen by her village to undertake a quest to find a sculpture of high importance that was stolen years ago and is thought to be hidden in dangerous ruins across the lands. As one of many maidens who have undertaken the quest to retrieve the sculpture over the years, none of whom have been successful nor have returned, Ashlyn faces the daunting task of braving horrendous monsters and dangerous lands if she hopes have even the slightest chance at succeeding.  Thankfully for Ashlyn, she has the mysterious and enigmatic mercenary Zane to accompany her on her quest, someone who sets Ashlyn\u2019s blood on fire and appeals to her like no other. With her loyal wolf Shadow by her side, Ashlyn and Zane journey afar to find the sculpture, stumbling across numerous dangers as they do and various individuals and creatures who help, rather than hinder their expedition.  Honestly, I loved Ashlyn! I thought she was a great character to follow and loved how Wheaton wrote her. The growth she undertook during this novel while managing to retain her base personality was excellent. I thought Ashlyn was very natural and kind, but also brave when she needed to be. She connected well with those around her and made for a great heroine.  Ashlyn\u2019s love interest in Shadow Fire comes in the form of Zane and boy do I love Zane. He\u2019s such an alluring character and very, very sexy. He\u2019s fierce and capable and willing to be naughty at times too. The romance between Ashlyn and Zane is a constant from the beginning and so much of this is due to Zane\u2019s utter dedication to Ashlyn and his promise to protect her. Zane would do anything for Ashlyn, and although their romance develops quickly, it\u2019s believable and very, very enjoyable. Wheaton keeps things progressing well, and Ashlyn and Zane\u2019s relationship is always front and center amongst the already addictive storyline; making it impossible not to love these two!  Shadow Fire has a stunning main couple, but I was also swept away by pirate rouge Taranis and would have personally loved a story featuring him, although I was happy that Wheaton decided to give him his own happiness at the end of the book.  As an addictive story with plenty of unexpected character development, Shadow Fire will catch from its opening chapter and leave you wanting more. Wheaton weaves a beguiling story that has me ready to devour it\u2019s companion novel upon its release. Definitely worth a read!"}, {"userName": "Katherine Paschal", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10815032-katherine-paschal", "userReview": "Once upon a time the Goddess Reiki roamed the earth and times were good. When her statue was stolen from the sacred temple, the world fell into discord and monsters started walking. Every few years a Chosen is selected, a girl pure of heart, to go on a voyage alone to retrieve the stolen statue. And every time, she fails with the outcome of death. This time Ashlyn was Chosen, much to her family\u2019s horror. But she will not journey alone, instead, Zane, the handsome mercenary full of secrets, accompanies her.This was a fairly fast paced fantasy novel. I sometimes feel like I get bogged down with information/world building overload, but I did not feel that was the case this time. The author did a nice job of making the story character driven with world building tidbits thrown in along the way. I enjoyed learning the history of the people and the worlds. But what I really loved was the crazy monsters and magical animals thrown in. Especially Shadow and Freya.And yes this is a fantasy story, but I would also have to say it was pretty heavy in the romance department as well. The two main characters have a fairly instant attraction, but they do not act on those feelings really (and yes we do find out about half way through why the attraction is not acted out fully, if you get my drift). They have a slow kind of courtship, where they learn who the other is before there are any acts of blind devotion or sacrifice performed. I like that they had a real relationship; they got to know each other right along with the reader getting to know them. That being said, good God those two were touchy! They had their hands on each other at every single opportunity. And they made out in the most awkward of situations/places. They needed a room to burn off some of that passion\u2026Don\u2019t expect any teen angst even though Ashlyn is a teenager. Instead, she processes all information and comes to a rational conclusion before acting. I will say I was impressed with that. In a lot of stories, miscommunication in a relationship causes angsty reactions and helps to move the story along. This book did not need that to forward the plot, there was enough going on to keep the character\u2019s together as a team. Ashlyn was a fairly strong character, but I will say that she probably would have died early on without Zane, regardless of her training and weapons.The one thing that really irked me was that three of the main characters had red hair. Yes they were slightly different shades, but seriously? There are other options for hair choices. I found it strange because Ashlyn was singled out repeatedly for her unique red hair, but obviously it was not that unique because pretty much everyone is a redhead. Maybe it is just me, but I had a hard time with that part of the story. Give me monster beasts, fanged bunnies, griffins, no problem, but make everyone a redhead and I have issues.Overall it was a good adventure fantasy book with a huge dollop of love. I am pretty sure the book is a standalone, because everything was wrapped up nicely at the end. I will check out more by this author in the future.I received this book from Goodreads and the author in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Nay Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25185510-nay-denise", "userReview": "**I received a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review**Looking for a ya novel with a bit of magic and romance? Well this is it! Kimber Leigh Wheaton did an amazing job writing this book. From the characters to the world building, I was totally pleased with this novel. The beginning did drag for me a bit, but once the action started I was sucked in until the end.A world ruled by a goddess, who has left her magicial powers in a lost statue. A white wolf who is in fact a demigod, the son of the goddess. An evil sorceress looking to obtain absolute power. A hunk of a mercenary that has the hots for Ashlyn and a wolf who is the last of his kind. That all added up to drama, massive kissing sessions and the truth about the lies told for years.Ashlyn is the Chosen One of Verdane. Her goal as a pure girl is to go on the Quest, a dangerous journey, to retrieve the Goddess Reiki statue and return it back to Verdane. She is supposed to travel alone but a mercenary named Zane tags along to ensure her safety. During the quest they encounter monsters, mercenaries, a demigod, pirates and Delistaire, an evil sorcerer after the statue to obtain more power. During the journey truths are revealed and lies are demolished.I totally loved Ashlyn as a female protagonist. Despite being afraid she still stayed strong and fought her way through. She was clever at learning and fighting. She wasn't so emotional and she did not always need to have Zane save her.Zane was a hot character. I was totally smitten with his strong, content personality. He cared for Ashlyn deeply and was loyal to her at all points even down to the romantic side.The romance was a bit instalove, but it brewed slowly. Zane knew how he felt the moment he saw Ashlyn, but respected her quest which was sweet. The kissing between them was intense and the way he held her when they laid down, priceless.The secrets about who his father was, his mother, Ashlyn being a mage and the Goddess statue was unbelievable. The true history that was shared about the statue and both Zane and Ashlyn was truly incredible.The ending made me extremely happy. Glad everything worked out for Ashlyn despite finding the truth about the statue.As for Delistaire, he was not only a douchebag and power obsessed idoit but a horrible husband and demeaning father. What he has done throughout his time was just unspeakable. I seriously need him to ger therapy, lol.The other characters I enjoyed in this book where Shadow, Ashlyn's wolf (the last of his kind). Loki, the demigod and son of the Goddess Reiki, the griffin and the ever so funny and friendly pirate Taranis. Taranis kept me laughing the whole time once he entered the story, but he was a brave and loyal young man.Characters I totally wanted to rip apart besides Delistaire were Cory because of what he did to Ashlyn at the very beginning and how he ruined her party and Mayor Franklin.Shadow Fire was an outstanding YA fantasy novel. I highly recommend for anyone to check it out. You won't be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Stephanie (Bookfever. \u2665)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4939266-stephanie-bookfever", "userReview": "I'm not gonna lie \u2014 I kind of had a hard time finishing Shadow Fire I did enjoy it for the most part but around 30% it started dragging a bit for me. It seemed there was no ending in sight. I am glad, though, that I did manage to finish it in the end.What's this book about? The village of Verdane chooses every five years a teenage girl who must go on an epic quest to find a stolen relic. Though the girls who get chosen always end up dead, they don't have a choice. This year they choose Ashlyn. Together with Zane, a tough but sexy mercenary she goes on a daring adventure to find the Goddess statue before the evil sorcerer Delistaire can get his hands on it. Along the way they meet several allies ( some mean well, others not so much), monsters and even magical creatures involved that can imprint imagines into your mind to communicate. Oh and there's kissing. A lot of kissing!Overall this was a good read but with some flaws. I liked the heroine in this book, for sure. Ashlyn was like a fantasy version of Katniss Everdeen in my eyes. She started out as a fierce character and kept that attitude for the most part of the book but sometimes that fierceness faded a bit, especially when other men (in other words: Zane) had to keep saving her. So those times were a little disappointing.Zane, the mercenary coming to Ashlyn's aide on her quest for a magical relic that can't fall in the wrong hands. It's hard not to love Zane. He's a very swoon worthy and I can definitely see why Ashlyn fell for him. My only minor point for their relationship was that it went so very fast. I'm not one for insta-love, though I can't quite say that's what happened. There was definitely insta-attraction, so I'll leave it at that.The quest was very interesting and long. I found myself enjoying everything Ashlyn and Zane were up against. The monsters were very fearsome, I have to admit. And I really loved Shadow (wolf) and Freya (griffin). They also met some other people but the one standing out the most to me was the pirate Taranis. He was simply awesome. And I loved that he ended up with someone as well!Now, about the writing. It was really colorful, in my opinion. I love the way the author described the world and it was descriptive too, which I love. I only had a problem with the language used in it. It didn't seem to fit with the time of this book, though I'm not sure if this is supposed to be set in the past. It does have a medieval feel about it and it is a fantasy book so I'm guessing that it is, and some words used didn't really fit. I can be totally wrong about this of course but I've seen other people saying similar things about it. But other than that I really did like the writing because it was quite good.All in all, Shadow Fire was a pretty good read with great writing, fierce characters and magic at every turn. Though it had a few flaws and was maybe a tad too long for me, I did like it and am glad to have read it. I'd recommend it to people who love fantasy."}, {"userName": "Maghon Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3382002-maghon-thomas", "userReview": "I loved this one. It's a fast paced action packed fantastic world building fantasy with some romance thrown in there too. I gotta say I loved the characters, but I totally loved the world building with all of the different supernatural beings in there. Magic, shiftersm mercenaries, secrets, betrayals, death. I mean, it's a great start to a fantastic new series! Ashlyn must sacrifice herself to save her community. Every few years, a girl who is pure must journey a long way from home to try to stop an evil sorcerer's reign of terror. He can use magic, and he does, horribly, while no one else can. She's brave, because she doesn't want to die, to leave her family, but she must, because she has younger sisters, and she would never want them to go through this. Plus, she has lost friends who've had to go on this journey, but they never come home alive. She expects to go alone, but someone who believes in her has paid a mercenary to join her for protection. Zane. Oh Boy. But anyways, thank goodness because they save each other's lives more than once. And they also get to fall in love. Ashlyn is a fantastic character. I loved her and I really do hope to see more of her in the future books. Zane is a mercenary who's traveled all over and can do a little magic. He hides his magic, but he's got a very rough past, so he has his reasons. And yet, he uses them for Ashlyn, and even teaches her a little. Zane falls hard for Ashlyn but he doesn't think they can be because of their circumstances. Then he trows caution out the window because this is a life or death journey, and if they survive, they have each other to fight for. Dude, the scary creatures, like the easter bunny mutant, yeah, like total epic, and the monster plants. I really don't wanna give too much away but the scenes are just great. And the plot, well there's a great build up with no cliff hanger so you'll be glad for that. I quite enjoyed this one and I look forward to jumping into book two ASAP! 5 MAGICAL PAWS... and could I maybe get a pet wolf, pretty pretty please, because he is my most favorite character of all.

A long time ago, I read The Dresden Files because one of my friends said he refused to talk to me until I gave it a try. While not talking to him was a bit tempting, I figured that I would still go ahead and give The Dresden Files a try and I fell in love with them. I thought that nothing would ever measure up to that series. But I was pleasantly surprised with Shadow Fire. More than, actually. Right off the bat, you're thrown into Ashlyn's survival-of-the-fittest world. This amazing lady is carrying a leopard back home from her hunting trip. She had taken this beast out when it threatened her life! Can you imagine tangling with a leopard? \"So what did I do today? Oh, I just took out a freaking leopard and then dragged it home. YOLO!\"As messed up as this will sound ... in that first chapter, you meet a broken Ashlyn and ... I LOVE IT! She's poor and worn down and tired and victimized ... truly broken. Until she is thrown together with Zane, at least. Zane seems to complete her and the way that he was written, I can totally see it. This isn't a far-fetched tale. Sure, there's magic and weird creatures but the meat of the story, the foundation, is based on this amazing relationship that Wheaton has created for her readers. The rapport between Zane and Ashlyn really speaks volumes and I think that it is something a lot of readers will be able to connect with. Let me take a moment to clear something up. Yes, this is a series. Yes, this novel can stand alone. Now, is it truly a stand alone? Man, when I finished this, it really seemed as if everything was buttoned up pretty neatly and unless the next novel branches off to be about a secondary character (which would be totally awesome ... especially if it is' about a certain pirate ... hint hint ...). I suggest not even worrying about whether it is stand alone or not and just give it a try.

The author did an incredible job creating a fresh story in a genre that's been there and done that. The writing style was creative, well done, and descriptively just right.Shadow Fire was a fast paced read full of adventure, suspense, twists, turns, and romantic tension.

It's surprisingly difficult. I enjoyed most of what I read, but I feel like I think about the technicalities a lot more whenever I'm considering the rating. There were certain things that didn't add up to me. The language, mannerisms, and euphemisms did not match the time period at all, and I got distracted by it more than once. But with all of that aside, I really did get sucked into the story. Besides the drag around the beginning, I found myself really drawn in and racing through. Ashlyn was touch and go for me. At times, I thought she was the little badass that I had hoped for. But at other times, she would wane and I would begin to doubt her resolve. In the end, I did enjoy her. The romance between her and Zane was very in your face. If PDA makes you uncomfortable, you will be squeamish while reading Shadow Fire. Kimber Leigh Wheaton does an excellent job at painting a vivid description of her world. Aside from my faults with the technicalities, I found myself wondering what would happen next while reading Shadow Fire. This novel is a very good addition to the YA genre. Even though the romance and kissing are very present, I found that the romance still stayed at PG-13 appropriate levels. Shadow Fire can be enjoyed by a large range of readers who have a soft spot for fantasy. **I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. My thanks to Kimber Leigh Wheaton."}, {"userName": "Jessica Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10244097-jessica-johnson", "userReview": "The introduction was beautifully written, with such crisp details. I absolutely love this book!Ashlyn is dealt a bad hand when she is chosen by her town to complete the impossible mission of finding the stolen goddess statue, luckily she has Zane by her side to save her more than once. With an evil sorcerer on their toes throughout their journey they constantly have to overcome the obstacles placed in their way. What an amazing and unique story I cannot wait to see what is in store for Ashlyn in the next book!!From the very first sentence, \"every step I take is one step closer to death\", the author grabs me! The introduction was beautifully written, with such crisp details. I absolutely love this book!! A fantasy with non stop action and an epic love that made my heart beat faster. Ashlyn is an amazing leading lady with spunk and a big heart. From the moment Zane is introduced it's hard not to fall for this hunky hero and the love that he continuously shows Ashlyn just warmed my heart! The writing was beautifully done on more than one occasion I had to stop and really let it soak in. Its hard not to love the characters as they are introduced throughout the story, each have such strong personalities in their own way.See more reviews  here"}, {"userName": "Deitre", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3520354-deitre", "userReview": "In search for something extremely important, Ashyln is the main character throughout this novel of excitement and adventure. If you don\u2019t look close at the cover you may miss a piece of foreshadowing lingering in the background. As this book is nothing but a great page turner of entertainment from start to finish. Ashyln isn\u2019t along on her mission. She has the handsome and supportive Zane to help her along the way. During their search they are faced with creatures that keep the reader on the edge of their seats. Wheaton keeps her readers interested throughout the novel. Giving bits at a time about the main characters journey.Wheaton\u2019s writing style truly speaks to YA. The storyline is captured in a way that truly has a well developed plot and storyline that comes to a full circle in the end. Maybe even leaving a little opening for more to come. Characters that you can visualize as you are read. Is great writing. Settings that you can see when you read. Is great writing. Novels that you just can\u2019t put down until the very end, is great writing. This is truly one that I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t miss out on!"}, {"userName": "Michelle Bryan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28792679-michelle-bryan", "userReview": "Shadow Fire was given to me by the author in exchange for my honest review. My first thought when reading this was that Kimber Leigh Wheaton has a beautiful writing style. Every detail is written to perfection and the characters are well rounded. I thoroughly enjoyed the story line. There was plenty of action scenes but I did find some of the problems the characters encountered to be too easily resolved. My only complaint about this book was the love story. I am so tired of the instant love romances and I couldn't get past the fact that Zane kept calling Ashlyn 'baby' or 'love'. I prefer my heroines to be more kick ass and less kissy kissy. I thought there was far too much emphasis placed on Ashlyn's red hair or Zane's muscled body. I kind of got tired of reading about this and found myself skipping those scenes. Maybe it was just me because judging from the other reviews no one else had issues with the over abundance of romance. That aside however I did enjoy the book overall and am giving it a 3.5. Thank you Ms. Wheaton for the opportunity :)"}], "description": "Ashlyn \u2013 a free-spirited teenager whose peaceful life is shattered when the village elders honor her with a perilous quest to recover a stolen relic.
