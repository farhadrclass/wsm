I never read the original series by Brian K. Vaughan but this is definitely enticing me to do so! I love how the Runaways reunite as a family over this trade. It takes them a while to get there especially as some of them say they are happy after moving on but come to the realisation that they\u2019re actually not.Old Lace is so much fun...may be a genetically engineered dinosaur with a nose ring but Lace is great \ud83d\udc97Gert is the only Runaway who feels like she doesn\u2019t contribute anything but all the others love her dearly and believe she is the most special. This explains why when Gert died that the Runaways fell apart and only now when she\u2019s saved from the past and brought to the present via time travel can the Runaways reunite. Nico is probably the loneliness runaway and has never been happy since the break of them. However I wonder why her and Chase left - the first break of the group after Gert died. She is a powerful mage who wields a staff which can do all sorts of magic...all she needs is blood and to never repeat the same spell - otherwise it rains and nothing happens...she can use variations of spell words but there are only so many ways you can say something! Chase is like he smart engineer who delved into changing the mechanics of Gerts parents tome machine to go back in time to save her from dying. He also manages to wake Victor up after he finally opens the box he received from stony Stark upon Victors \u2018death\u2019. Molly is kind of like the hulk - as it says in Rainbow Rowells words but without the angry and green \ud83d\ude02 she\u2019s such a cute girl who basically looks like she wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly but deep down she\u2019s very strong in power. Finally Karolina seems to possess some sort of magic which allows her to neutralise things...when in her \u2018magic form\u2019 she appears more like a rainbow of colours/light similar to a spectral form of herself...it looks pretty cool.The beginnings of a story in this trade were really enjoyable I liked learning about each Runaway on an individual level and also how they used to be and are now as a family. This made me laugh as well as feel sad for the characters - especially Gert as she feels so out of place coming forward to a time where she has been dead for 2 years from the past...everyone has changed except her. The art was so wonderful....I really enjoyed the art style very unique \ud83d\udc97 I loved some of the features variant covers especially the one by Skottie Young (I Hate Fairyland - also a great series!).I look forward to the following issues because this made for a great renewal of the series!"}, {"userName": "Mara", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10194700-mara", "userReview": "Ah wow, this did a terrible job of reintroducing the characters and story to new readers.

Here's why:Brian K. Vaughn's Runaways is one of my all-time favorite comic series. I only discovered them last August, and when I did, I devoured the forty-plus issues as fast as I could get my hands on them. I adored it because it focused on the characters. Yes, there was a lot going on between super powers, superheroes, and super villains, but at its core, it was a story about these teenagers who were struggling in life. It was about the characters. Rowell's stories are like that. (I've read almost all of her books.) She writes great characters. And in her little letter at the beginning of this trade, she expressed that she too loved these characters and loved how Vaughn's comics focused on them as people. This made me happy and gave me a sense of relief that she would do well by these characters.And while this trade isn't the best thing ever, I loved seeing these characters that I had fallen in love with months ago again. Rowell has captured the essence of the Runaways. Her take on them is nostalgic and worthwhile, and the art isn't half-bad either (I know that's an unpopular opinion. It's not the same without Alphona's work, but Anka does a great job at breathing new life into these characters and slightly modernizing them). All in all, this reboot of Runaways is worth reading if you're a fan of Brian K. Vaughn's original series, of the Hulu show, of Rowell's novels, or even just someone wanting a first exposure to these characters."}, {"userName": "Renata", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75319-renata", "userReview": "(read as single issues)I love Rainbow Rowell, I love the Runaways, I love telepathic cats, sooI do feel like this volume had a lot of heavy lifting to do in order to get everybody reassembled, so like...I enjoyed this a lot on its own merits but I'm more excited about what can come next!"}, {"userName": "Christiana", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/434450-christiana", "userReview": "Is there anything Rainbow can\u2019t write?

Most of the characters have dispersed out into other series, while others have fallen into obscurity. It seemed like, even with a TV show on the horizon, that Marvel were happy to let them languish. And then along came Rainbow Rowell and Kris Anka, two creators with a momentous task ahead of them that they both rise to fantastically.In her first Marvel comics work, Rowell takes these disparate characters and weaves them back together in an almost seamless way that respects all of the continuity that they have gone through across multiple other titles while giving them a good reason to be back together as well. Rowell's characters all read both true to their pre-established personalities and informed by their previous decisions to become the people that they are now. They're not all kids anymore, but they're not quite adults either (no matter how much they try to be). It's wonderful storytelling that will have fans of the characters jumping for joy.Kris Anka's artwork is absolutely jaw dropping. His eye for fashion and individual body types is perfect for a book about late teen/early twenties characters, and he shows a good eye for humour as well, especially with Old Lace doing things in the background of panels.Runaways could have fallen so very flat, and yet thanks to Rowell and Anka, it soars to heights unseen for a very, very long time.

Vaughan and Adrian Alphona I said, \u201cGeared towards teens, this graphic novel perfectly captures children\u2019s angst towards their parents and their thoughts of how they will be better than them and their wicked ways.\u201d I thought the premise of the story was fun and fresh and would really appeal to the younger reader. While I didn\u2019t read further than the first volume, I know who of the original six was the mole, and what happened to the parents of these youth. This book reunites the group in dramatic fashion as Chase brings a dying Gert from the past into the future for Nico to heal with her magic powers. Suddenly Gert is thrust back into modern day, while the rest of the Runaways has aged two years, leaving her significantly younger than Chase who had been her boyfriend at the time of her death. These three seek to reunite the group, as they had gone their own ways after Gert\u2019s death. They first meet up with alien Karolina who is happy in college and in a relationship, and doesn\u2019t feel the need to rejoin. Then they head to find Molly, who has been living with her Grandma, as she is only in middle school. Molly\u2019s scientist Grandmother is (of course) not what she seems, and the five remaining Runaways must band together again.This story had a lot of plot threads from the past to pull together into a cohesive new narrative, and sometimes I struggled with keeping up. I appreciated the clues given in character\u2019s thoughts or dialogue and even a few author asides to catch the reader up to what happened in the past. There was a mention and a picture of Nico when she belonged to the A-Force during her time away from the Runaways and another mention to Victor\u2019s fate (who was a member of the team in later volumes). So although I had read the first book of the series, plus other books that had these characters in it, I still felt muddled at times. A new reader to this series is going to have to play a lot of catch up to understand what is going on.Rowell\u2019s dialogue is spot on, as I knew it would be. I am a huge fan of her novels (especially Eleanor & Park) so I have to commend her for adapting well to the comics format. But she might want to tone down the quips a bit as snarky conversation can get old, for I was frustrated with Gert throughout the entire story. I don\u2019t see her appeal, much less as a genuine love interest to Chase.The art by Kris Anka was a great match to the story. I liked how he incorporated Old Lace and the cats into the panels, with little jokes going on in the background. At times some of the art was anime-inspired and he drew great crowd scenes. I enjoyed that some of the chapter breaks included variant art, a few from original artist Alphona.This is a series that I will definitely keep on purchasing for the teens at my library. I feel that the series will continue strongly under Rowell and Anka\u2019s direction, as they dropped enough clues in this first volume to promise great adventures in the future."}, {"userName": "Xanthe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36929-xanthe", "userReview": "I picked up the original run (heh) of Runaways a million years ago because I heard that Joss Whedon was going to write some issues and I wanted to be able to know what was going on (that\u2019s how long ago I started reading Runaways\u2026.) By the time I\u2019d read every single volume of Brian Vaughan\u2019s original issues, despite my then-love for Whedon\u2019s stuff, I was pretty opposed to reading anyone else\u2019s take on the characters, because I so adored what Brian Vaughan had done (special mention to Adrian Alphona\u2019s art in those first issues. So completely lovely and expressive. I loved when he turned up again drawing for Ms. Marvel.) Anyways, I kept up with the series for several volumes, including Whedon\u2019s time-travel issues, and then, well, some bad things happened to the characters. Well, even more bad things. Some things that I had a hard time getting over. The artists changed, the writing was okay, fine even, but I just stopped reading. Enter Rainbow Rowell, writer of YA fiction for the discerning fangirl (mostly.) I liked her stuff just fine too, but I wasn\u2019t swept away, so I didn\u2019t leap to find the firsts issue when it was announced that she would take over. Well, my local library got this volume, and I must have been more excited than I realized to see the team back together on the cover because I snatched it up. And I sorta loved it. Stuff has happened. Shit got real. The team is scattered and they spend the volume getting back together and I found myself eating it up and ready for more.I slid right into the story despite missing a bunch of drama in the volumes I never got around to reading, plus the adventures of a few of the characters in other books (Victor and Nico both seem to have joined the Avengers at different points? Also, I should probably track down the Battleworld crossover.) Anyways, there are real consequences to be dealt with, especially for how they fix the big drama that made me so heartbroken in previous issues. I think it\u2019s dealt with very well (trying to be vague here\u2026) and really, I wasn\u2019t going to be picky how it was done, or say it wasn\u2019t earned or whatever, because I just wanted it to happen. (Okay, I\u2019ll stop being vague \u2013 spoiler!!!!!!!! Gert is back!!!! Maybe it\u2019s not such a huge spoiler since she\u2019s in a huge silhouette on the cover.) The Runaways spend this volume mostly in conflict and doubt \u2013 so business as usual \u2013 as they fill Gert in on what she\u2019s missed and revisit all their current situations, dancing around whether or not the team is getting back together. The interactions between Molly, Gert, Nico, Chase, and Carolina are all lovely and smooth (but what happened to Xavin??? And this thing with Victor is getting resolved at some point, right? They just let Klara go? Um, what?) The plot doesn\u2019t seem to be much beyond their will-they-or-won\u2019t-they, so we\u2019ll have to see how the superhero shenanigans shape up, but I\u2019m glad to to see all my faves together again and am ready for more."}, {"userName": "Lara", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/309689-lara", "userReview": "Runaways is the series that got me into comics. This was when it was Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona, and that pair? MAGIC. And then Alphona stopped doing the art and BKV stopped doing the writing and Joss Whedon showed up and WHAT THE HELL EVEN HAPPENED. I know people love Joss Whedon and all, but...his Runaways was not good. I eventually got bored with it and walked away--just like Alphona and BKV--before it ended. Jump to finding out Rainbow Rowell was taking up the reins, like, a long time later. I mean...I couldn't resist that, right? No, I couldn't. I trusted her to somehow bring back the beauty of this series that Joss Whedon...well, just didn't. Spoiler alert (not really, because my rating is plainly visible): nope.Now, part of the problem for me was the art. It's good art, don't get me wrong, but just...NOBODY tops Alphona, and also I just...couldn't get behind this version of Chase. Or Karolina. Or Nico. But seriously, mainly Chase. WTF is up with that hair. I mean. Dude.Aaaanyway, onto the story. Which is...I guess everybody all split up at the end of the series? This one starts out with Chase bumbling into Nico's place having somehow gone back in time to save Gert (not terribly spoilery because Gert is mentioned in the blurb). First of all, I feel like this move completely cheapens Gert's original storytline. The actual really hard things these kids go through are a huge part of what I loved so much about the series and about BKV's writing. It felt real and human and heartbreaking, despite the superhero-y trappings, and taking that all back just feels...dumb. And boring. And obvious. \"Let's get the band back together\" seems to be the entire point of this volume, which...why? None of the reasons make sense to me, and the way they go about it is slap-sticky and ridiculous. There's nothing particularly funny, or sweet, or anything in this volume, and really, the whole thing just feels bland and done before and a total let-down after I've already had way too many total let-downs with this series. And at this point? I think the only thing that could bring this series back for me is if by some extremely unlikely and wonderful miracle BKV & Alphona took it back on, and even then, it's been so long that who knows how that would even turn out? I think for me, I'm just going to let it lie. RIP, Runaways. Always in my heart (well, at least the first 24 issues).Rainbow Rowell: sorry, girl. I'll keep reading your books.

It's just all comics on Marvel Unlimited, the Netflix-for-Marvel app, so I don't bother putting it here. But then, once in a while, I actually go out and buy a Marvel comic and put it here anywho. Rainbow Rowell working on Runaways fit the bill. Along with Ultimate Spider-Man, this was a comic from my tween years that was still amazing as an adult. Plus, Rainbow Rowell is one of my favorite authors, surprising nobody. This is a brilliant comic. Rowell's dialogue is the same as it was when we first met her, back in the Eleanor & Park days, but it lends itself to the goofy-cartoony-dramedy Runaways tone especially well. She wisely restricted her callbacks to the Brian K Vaughn run, and references to the Runaways' solo careers are both accurate to their comics AND broad-strokes-y to avoid continuity lockout for new or returning readers. Ya don't have to read Avengers AI to get what's up with Victor. It's all good stuff. ...It's just an odd statement for comics as a whole. That Writing For The Trade trend (telling bits of a story, rather than writing a full story in each issue, and selling the issues as a complete arc in the bookstore) has been going on for decades now, but when it was just comic writers doing it, it felt like a progression of what comic book writing was and is. Cut to present day: we have a straight-up Printz award winner writing six-issue story arcs that read like short stories. To put it another way: this would have been the slowest comic in the world if I'd read it issue by issue, as it's clear that Rowell is writing a complete story with her six issues. Why bother with individual issues at all? But yeah. Rainbow Rowell is writing Runaways.

I didn't care as much for the direction Joss Whedon took the team after Brian K. Vaughan passed off his creation. Then, over the years, I'd occasionally see one or another of the characters somewhat involved in another superhero story, which gave me a nice nostalgic feeling. I vaguely recall some big Marvel Event where a version of Molly in the future played a role. Nico was on a team that's mentioned in this book as having been the all-time greatest girl gang - and it really WAS a fantastic concept and lineup! - but I don't think it was very well written and didn't leave much of a memorable impact. A few years ago, Tom King wrote a really incredible and underappreciated series about the Vision and his family living in Washington D.C. The title only lasted twelve issues, but used another character from Runaways that I had all but forgotten about: Victor Mancha. However, it was seeing the whole first season of the very well-made Hulu original series recently that reignited my interest in the Runaways.This is called Volume 1, and it does try to introduce the basics details of everyone for newcomers, but it would be better enjoyed if you're already familiar with the first few volumes of the manga-style graphic novels written by BKV in the mid-'00s. Rainbow Rowell does a pretty good job with the tone, but too much of this volume is spent slowly getting the band back together, and the main villain and point of conflict is both boring and predictable.

As a newbie, I thought the basic backstory filled in nicely, and I love that Runaways are actually children of super villains. Some of that moral struggle does come through.I also loved the art.
