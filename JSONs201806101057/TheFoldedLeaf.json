It has a lot to say about the impact of the early death of a mother and of a distant father on a boy, even during a time when that distance must've been viewed as ordinary.The outline of the plot is ordinary, the intense friendship between two opposites inevitably tested when they are at college together; but the writing, especially those passages when the narratorial voice steps out of his storytelling at the perfect times to explore the wide spaces that come between even the closest of human beings, and what we must do to traverse those spaces, so we can expand beyond ourselves, so we can live, is extraordinary."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730330-tim", "userReview": "One can see the coming perfection of \"Time Will Darken It\" (1948) all over William Maxwell's 1945 novel. I first read this 15-20 years ago, and liked it enough to later read \"Time\" and love it. But a 2010 revisit to \"The Folded Leaf\" revealed qualities I seemed not to have fully appreciated earlier. Perhaps I wasn't completely ready for its simplicity and beauty then; maybe I'm wiser.But, wisdom: Maxwell was one of the wisest, purest, sparest writers around, weaving his simple, ordinary plots with, seemingly, magic spells that made you look at life in a unique way.\"The Folded Leaf\" tells the lovely and at times heartbreaking story of an unusual friendship, a love story, if you will, between male friends with no labels attached. Lymie Peters is an unathletic, thin, smart \"geek,\" I suppose, though I'm not sure that word existed in 1920s Illinois. Lymie isn't picked on; he's liked as a sort of quiet appendage to other groups of boys. Spud Latham is everything Lymie wishes he were: athletic and broodingly charismatic, popular. Spud, just moved to the small Illinois town, gets in fights as a way to prove something to himself. Maxwell follows the boys' friendship for about four years, from high school into college. Viewed from a distance, it might seem as if Lymie is always underfoot: he's constantly at Spud's side to lace up his boxing gloves, hand him a towel; the two are physically close, even spooning in the cold upper floor of their college residence. When walking outdoors, Lymie puts his hand in Spud's coat pocket and their fingers intertwine. It is the way their friendship works, and it certainly is love in its simplest state. Though one could glean hints that Lymie's love might be unthinking homosexuality or that he might be bisexual, that's a pretty modern look at the relationship and the truth here doesn't really matter. I think it's better to leave it be. As Maxwell writes: \"The truth is nothing as simple or as straightforward a thing as Lymie believed it to be. It masquerades in inversions and paradoxes, is easier to get at in a lie than in an honest statement. If pursued, the truth withdraws, puts on one false face after another, and finally goes underground, where it can only be got at in the complex, agonizing absurdity of dreams.\"In college, Lymie, Spud and Spud's girlfriend, Sally Forbes, are inseparable. Sally easily accepts Lymie not as a third wheel but as a true friend, a natural component of their three-way partnership. Spud joins a fraternity and no longer lives with Lymie, and cracks, never spoken about but sensed, start to form between Spud and Lymie. Spud, more a man of action than a thinker, better able to pound a Golden Gloves opponent into submission than understand what's really bothering him, becomes jealous of Lymie's relationship with Sally. Lymie, who really has done nothing wrong, is devastated by Spud's reaction.This is a subtle, simple, sharply told story that doesn't reveal all its secrets. It's Maxwell's second-best novel, which makes it very good indeed."}, {"userName": "Laysee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863523-laysee", "userReview": "The Folded Leaf was written in 1945. Maxwell said it was his favorite novel for \"personal reasons - the whole of my youth is in it\". Set in the 1920s in Chicago, the story centered on the unlikely friendship between two adolescent males: Lymie Peters and Spud Latham. It depicted a true-to-life picture of life on an American university campus that came with horrific initiation parties, the facetious pomposity of being a member of a Fraternity or Sorority, drills of lectures, and after-class cafe chats.I had a soft spot for Lymie who could not play a game to save his life. Lymie was also socially awkward and painfully thin. He was always the last to be chosen in any kind of team sport. But Lymie\u2019s academic star was shining. Spud, by contrast, had the body of a Greek god. He was athletic, confident, and socially aloof. Lymie was drawn to Spud when the latter saved him from drowning. The friendship developed in heartwarming ways but became strained when Sally Forbes became a mutual love interest. The novel, however, is no shallow coming of age story. I was surprised at the philosophical reflections that emerged at various points in the narrative; some of which, I felt, were out of place. For example, this interlude - \"But to live in the world at all is to be committed to some kind of a journey.\" \u2013appeared somewhat dislocated in the narrative. There was a chapter wholly devoted to the desert which did flow better from the story line: \"The desert is the natural dwelling place not only of Arabs and Indians but also of people who can't speak when they want to and of those others who, like Lymie Peters, have nothing more to say, people who have stopped justifying and explaining, stopped trying to account for themselves or their actions, stopped hoping that someone will come along and love them, and so make sense out of their lives.\" Heartbreaking but real for some of us. To me, the most disturbing reflection was on truth. \"The truth is nothing like as simple or as straightforward a thing as Lymie believed it to be. It masquerades in inversions and paradoxes, is easier to get at in a lie than in an honest statement. If pursued, the truth withdraws, puts on one false face after another, and finally goes underground, where it can only be got at in the complex, agonizing absurdity of dreams.\" I could not help but wonder if even a strong friendship could confront the truth and not be irrevocably jeopardized. Truth comes at a cost.The Folded Leaf is not a book for everyone. Maxwell said, \"While I was working on it, in my mind's eye I kept seeing the manuscript burning in the fireplace; I was sure nobody would be interested in it.\" Well, I was. I was glad I read it."}, {"userName": "Lobstergirl", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl", "userReview": "If this 1945 novel were published today it would be marketed as YA. Two fifteen year old boys, one solidly middle class, athletic, and good looking (Spud), the other lower middle class, half-orphaned, small, skinny, and ridiculously unathletic (Lymie), become best friends on the north side of Chicago in the 1920s. We're given vignettes of their daily lives at school, in sports activities, in their respective apartments with their families, such as they are. Lymie lives with his heavy-drinking salesman father and they take all their meals at the local cheap restaurant, where his father ogles the female customers and tries to look down the waitress's uniform. Spud's family has been forced to move from a large, comfortable house in Wisconsin to Chicago, and he sleeps in a closet-like porch in the apartment, but his family is whole and his mother serves big, nourishing meals every night. When she sees how skinny Lymie is, she deduces he is missing a mother, takes him under her wing, and insists he come over for dinner whenever possible. (Biographical note: William Maxwell's mother died when he was ten in the 1918 flu epidemic.)The novel then skips ahead several years as the boys enroll at the University of Illinois. Their social lives continue apace: Spud boxes and is invited to join a fraternity and falls in love with a girl, while Lymie gets good grades, is ignored by the fraternities, and expands his crush on Spud. I felt that literary claustrophobia brought on by too much youth and too much 1920s. Boys giving girls pins, boys calling each other \"fella,\" fraternity initiations, sorority dances, ghastly young love. Maxwell indicates this is a coming-of-age story with his title The Folded Leaf, taken from \"The Lotos-Eaters\" by Alfred Tennyson. The folded leaf is the form of the new leaf as it first emerges on the branch:Lo! in the middle of the wood,\t The folded leaf is woo\u2019d from out the bud\tWith winds upon the branch, and there\tGrows green and broad, and takes no care,\tSun-steep\u2019d at noon, and in the moon\tNightly dew-fed; and turning yellow\t Falls, and floats adown the air.\tLo! sweeten\u2019d with the summer light,\tThe full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow,\tDrops in a silent autumn night."}, {"userName": "Graham Crawford", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5884833-graham-crawford", "userReview": "I came to this with some reservations - a gay novel written in the 40's about a relationship in 1920's Chicago ran the risk of being irrelevant, coy, and too tragic for a post gay rights reader. I was pleasantly surprised. Maxwell writes simply with a slightly wry tone. It's obvious this was written in a time when the \"love that could not be named - couldn't be written about in a novel. It's equally obvious that Maxwell didn't want to write one of those books wading in queer subtext - so he wrote about silence. The homosexuality is never mentioned, but there is never any doubt about what's going on. The Silences become cruel gaps which breed violence and despair - and its precisely those silences that keep this book fresh and meaningful today.All the things unsaid between the characters - the fathers and sons, the girl friends - the mothers - and the deadly consequences that grow in these gaps are still us today. This is a study of human nature, not just a queer love affair in a time it wasn't allowed. The attempted suicide at the end - and the passages on recovery could have been written today.

I am not generally a fan of the \"pained adolescence\" novel, having had several of them forced on me in junior high and high school. Maxwell's gorgeous, patient prose, by contrast, achieves the admirable task of placing the reader in the minds and milieus of these young men, without forgetting that there is an entire world of frustrated and failing adults around them. Indeed, in addition to the story of the boys, Maxwell also shows us the almost charming ignorance of the privileged, the isolated social realm of the university and those who subsist on its margins, and the pained self-awareness of men who have failed at their task of raising their sons. But it is the story of Lymie and Spud--one a nearly helpless physical specimen, the other full of misdirected anger--that is the core of this extraordinary, heartbreaking novel."}, {"userName": "Jerry Delaney", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1976189-jerry-delaney", "userReview": "Amazing book.

The Folded Leaf is the serenely observed yet deeply moving story of two boys finding one another in the Midwest of the 1920s, when childhood lasted longer than it does today and even adults were more innocent of what life could bring. The story tells of Lymie and Spud, two young boys who share a strong friendship, even though they seem utterly different. The novel is told primarily from the perspective of Lymie, a shy, withdrawn, introverted and very sensitive young man who loves Spud with all of his heart. Spud, on the other hand, is somewhat stronger, an athlete who does not understand, but is able to appreciate, the sensitivity of his friend. They compliment one another, with Lymie taking security from Spud's strength while Spud draws another kind of strength from his friend. The story of their friendship and its inevitable change as they mature into adults is told with psychological prescience and great nuance. It is a classic novel from one of our most honored writers--the author of such acclaimed works as So Long, See You Tomorrow and All the Days and Nights.

They room together, and become close to two girls, but trouble lies ahead as misunderstanding and jealousy take their toll, eventually leading Lymie to desperate steps.This is a most engaging novel. Set in the 1920s it captures much of the period with detailed descriptions of place and fashion.

I disagree. While it did seem somewhat detached--it felt detached in a \"masculine\" way--meaning in the way (particularly in the time the novel was set and written) men are expected to not express their emotions directly (this tendency being embodied, in particular, by Spud) rather than in a \"scientific\" or purely observational way. This detachment made the moments of poetry even more profound as well as contrasted with the eventual realization of Lymie's and even Spud's (actual) complete lack of detachment.

I think perhaps that if the ending had been more upbeat in the way The Charioteer had been written then it would be as popular as that book because it\u2019s certainly written as beautifully and to read it is to truly immerse yourself in the high school and university life of 1920\u2032s America with the coon skin coats, letterman sweaters and the heady importance of who you knew against what you knew. However, these aren\u2019t grown men able to do what they like with their lives, and they aren\u2019t in England. They are 19 year old American schoolboys in 1920 smalltown America.I think I\u2019d have to disagree with the blurb, though. I didn\u2019t see any indication that Lymie was attracted to Sally at any point. They liked each other extremely well, but it is Spud\u2019s misinterpretation of Lymie\u2019s friendship with her that causes the conflict, not any realistic attraction at all.Are Lymie and Spud homosexual? I think possibly, yes. I would say that Spud shows bisexual tendencies and Lymie homosexual. In today\u2019s frat houses I think that they would\u2013as they are sleeping together in The Folded Leaf, and always sleep touching in a sweet innocent fashion\u2013take their relationship to another level. I got the impression from the story that neither boy ever had any suspicions as to what their deep feelings really meant. Even when Lymie longs to touch Spud, I felt it was more of an adoration of a body of a type that he could never hope to have, for he himself is an entirely different body shape, rather than any sexual desire. Very often, looking at Spud, he felt the desire which he sometimes had looking at statues\u2013to put out his hand and touch some part of Spud, the intricate interlaced muscles of his side, or his shoulder blades, or his back, or his flat stomach, or the veins of his wrists, or his small pointed ears.The affection is clear between them both, but stronger from Lymie to Spud. Spud inhabits a much more physical world than Lymie; he boxes, he swims\u2013does all sport well, while Lymie\u2019s skills are cerebral and Spud takes Lymie for granted, while always wanting him in his life. I think that others see their relationship a little more clearly than they do themselves, notably the effeminate landlord (there\u2019s always one!) and Spud\u2019s own family, who, until Sally is brought home to meet them, had been entirely accepting of Lymie\u2019s place in Spud\u2019s life.The crisis comes when a mutual acquaintance tells Lymie (and it\u2019s never acknowledged as to whether it\u2019s a true tale he tells) that Spud hates Lymie because of Sally\u2019s friendship. Sensitive Lymie feels entirely betrayed and takes matters into his hands. Thankfully the book doesn\u2019t end with tragedy (and I think for the sake of readers of this blog I\u2019ll be forgiven for spoiling this much) but still, the author writes the only ending that would have been accepted in 1945, after giving us one of the most memorable scenes in the book.If you liked The Charioteer, you\u2019ll definitely like this, because it has much in common with its themes and has beautiful prose\u2013and as a piece of homosexual history, I\u2019d think it definitely rates a read from anyone interested in America at this time."}, {"userName": "Stevosteve", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69576355-stevosteve", "userReview": "One of the finest novels in existence, this book is a pleasure to read, or in this case, read again many times over.

Set in Illinois before WWII, \u201cLeaf\u201d follows the life of Lymie Peters, a boy who lost his mother early and is being raised by an often absent salesman father who brings home the occasional younger woman for \u201cparties.\u201d In high school Lymie\u2019s life is literally and figuratively saved by \u201cSpud\u201d Latham, a jock who recently moved into town with his family from Wisconsin. Lymie and Spud develop a friendship as both are outsiders. Spud\u2019s family easily welcomes Lymie into their comfortable home in one of the novel\u2019s most moving scenes: \u201cWhen he turned and walked into the living room he knew instantly why it was that he hadn\u2019t wanted to come here, and that he ought to get out as soon as he possibly could. There, staring him in the face, was everything he\u2019d been deprived of for the last five years.\u201dAs both boys graduate and go to a nearby small college, Spud\u2019s looks and athleticism lead him to be popular on campus with fraternities and women in a way that emotionally withdrawn, skinny Lymie cannot. Lymie\u2019s clinginess and dependency on Spud eventually cause Spud to reject Lymie, leading to catastrophic results.I was curious how this book would compare to Maxwell\u2019s brilliant final novel, \u201cSo Long, See You Tomorrow.\u201d Both deal with teenage friendships in small town Illinois and in both a main character is haunted by the loss of his mother when he was younger. \u201cSo Long,\u201d though, is a very different work than \u201cFolded Leaf.\u201d \u201cSo Long\u201d is the work of an older author (age 72), and a lifetime of regrets about missed opportunities in the friendship gives it its force. \u201cLeaf\u201d is the work of a younger author (37) who flirts with tragedy but ends on a more promising note. \u201cLeaf\u201d may not be as accomplished a work, but it has its own power to move the reader.\u201cThe Folded Leaf\u201d is sometimes listed as an early example of a gay novel; it\u2019s a worthy question, but the 1945 work doesn\u2019t provide easy answers. Unloved Lymie finds that Spud provides him with someone to care about who also, sometimes grudgingly, cares about him. Spud may have (typical for his age and personality) trouble in sorting out his feelings for Lymie, and it may be internalized homophobia that leads to his later rejection of Lymie. The emotions are never acted upon sexually, but there is a sense of Lymie\u2019s need and longing for love as he tries to decipher mixed signals from Spud. And there is a final scene that forces the reader to reassess his assumptions about the relationship. In short the ambiguity, whether intentional or necessary due to the time period, lends itself to a good book club discussion.

Maxwell moves freely between characters, observing their outward and inner states. The story, however, centers on two characters, Lymie and Spud, one feeble but bright, the other a boxer, violent and beautiful. The choice to tell this story at a significant distance seems right, not only because the events of this coming-of-age novel could easily slip into melodrama or sentimentality, but also because the quiet observations of the characters from varying points of view allows the reader to see more completely the world in which Spud and Lymie are situated, certainly more clearly than either of them could articulate on their own.The distant third-person narration also seems necessary given the time and the subject matter. The relationship between Lymie and Spud is intimate, and the book intimates throughout that Lymie's attachment to Spud is more than that of a friend. When Spud moves out of the boarding house and the bed the two boys share, Lymie is devastated; he lays his own arm across his chest and imagines it is Spud's in order to fall asleep. The climax of the novel leaves little doubt about Lymie's feelings, but what is interesting is that the narrator never comes out and says that Lymie is in love with Spud. It does say that he is in love with Sally, Spud's girlfriend. Spud notices Lymie's feelings for Sally and is jealous, all of which is commented on quite directly, but the relationship between Spud and Lymie is always viewed at an indirect angle.In 1920s Midwestern America homosexuality certainly existed, but it was rarely, if ever, pointed to directly. Maxwell could not easily \"come out\" and say that Lymie has sexual feelings for Spud, and in fact the characters and story are too complicated for such stark labels. Lymie is no more a homosexual than he is a heterosexual, and bisexual implies a consciousness that is decades away. As in each of Maxwell's novels, the characters resist classification, a trait that makes \"The Folded Leaf\" ahead of its time, and ahead of our time too."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223377-katie", "userReview": "Set in Chicago in the 1920s, The Folded Leaf tells the story of an intense friendship between two boys, Lymie Peters and Spud Latham. If I tell you that the boys are opposites--Lymie studious and gangly, Spud possessed of all the popularity and physical beauty that Lymie knows he will never have--and if I tell you that the novel follows them to college, where they live together in a boarding house until Spud falls in love with a girl and joins a fraternity--if I tell you all of this, you may imagine a broad, unsubtle story, full of stereotypical characters and situations. I don't know how to write a synopsis that would do justice to the tenderness and deep insight that Maxwell brings to his novel. It would be so easy, for instance, to view Lymie's continuing devotion to Spud, even while Spud pulls farther and farther away from him, as pathetic. But Maxwell won't let us get away with that--he makes us see Lymie's feelings as complex, evolving, and painful.The book was published in 1945, and it's heavier on narration than is currently fashionable, but that didn't bother me. It reminded me of Winesburg, Ohio and The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter in the way it seeks out the things that are weird and secret in everyone, even the peripheral characters. But what I loved most was Maxwell's willingness to let his story dwell in ambiguity. He doesn't feel the need to define Spud and Lymie's feelings for each other as friendship, love, or sexual attraction--he allows them to exist as a complicated mixture of all three. There is one frankly erotic fight scene between Spud and a stranger in a park, and a great deal of physical intimacy between Spud and Lymie (they share a bed in their boarding house, for instance), but Maxwell never feels the need to declare whether the boys are gay or straight. Near the end, the novel undergoes a slight shift toward melodrama that is perhaps unnecessary, but all in all it is a lovely, compassionate, and beautifully written book."}, {"userName": "Bbrown", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6261192-bbrown", "userReview": "For the most part this book bored me. The plot mainly revolves around \"Spud\" Latham and Lymie Peters and their strange relationship, which oscillates and shifts between average friendship, master-servant, and ambiguous love. A girl named Sally is introduced half way through the book, but despite the fact that she is often presented as the third point of a triangle the narrative is really centered on the two boys. Didn't find the story particularly compelling, brought to mind a soap opera set in the 1920s, but it wasn't bad either. What bogged me down was the writing. Maxwell loves to describe scenery and things happening around the characters that have little or no bearing on them, and this goes on for pages with prose I didn't find impressive. Maxwell also has a penchant for extended metaphors, whether it be hazing as the primeval ritual, life as an obstacle course, or the cruelty of existence as a desert, that aren't half as clever as he thinks they are. Cut down to a lean novella I might have found The Folded Leaf decent, though even then it would have been far from great, but as it stands I found it thoroughly meh. 2.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Virgowriter (Brad Windhauser)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6159915-virgowriter-brad-windhauser", "userReview": "There are parts that are painfully slow and the point of view is all over the place. It has the melodrama of an after school special at times. The gay content is there, although most of it is buried deep in the subtext. The story hinges on the relationship between friends Spud and Lymie--and there is genuine affection between the two, which rarely gets physical--and never gets sexual. We're supposed to read Lymie's big action as a cry for hep and one that suggests his love for Spud drove him to it--but you have to make some leaps to make this stick. Read as a gay story, it's sadly typical of the era, where being gay is a tragedy to be avoided. Even The boarding house \"father\" is shown in a negative, sad light."}], "description": "In the suburbs of Chicago in the 1920s, two boys initiate an unusual friendship: Lymie Peters, a skinny and somewhat clumsy boy who always gets good grades, and newcomer Spud Latham, a star athlete and mediocre student.
