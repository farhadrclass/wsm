Rory is such a bad ass so full of life and laughter to find him in a coma waiting to die from hellhound poisoning was traumatizing. Claire the phoenix matriarch is his mate and on her way to heal him but as luck would have it she never arrives to the lair as planned because an evil griffin who plans to be her mate as well kidnaps her. And that my friends is all I will reveal of the story. Just know that there is plenty of emotional ups and downs as well as action to be found within, of course there is also romance in these pages.Do yourself a favor and grab a copy.

I will drop everything to read a new release, as soon as it's out and you better not expect me to do anything while I'm reading it. Nothing gets done, except the book. This is the 13th book in the Dragon Guard Series. And this is Rory's story.Rory is the younger brother of Rian and Royce. He's always given his brethren crap and a hard time for being so gaga over their mates, well, now it's his turn. Only problem is, he was bit by a hell hound in the previous book and the poison is slowly killing him from the inside out, at the start of this book. He is basically in a coma, but can hear everything going on around him. The Elders, Kalysta, Siobhan, and Kyra are doing all they can do for him. There's only one person that can help him....Claire, the leader of the Clan of the Sun. She is on her way to him, but of course it can't be that easy. I absolutely love all of these characters. Claire is very interesting and I wasn't expecting her to be what she is. Yes, I'm being vague about her because I don't want to spoil it for you. But it's awesome. She is a badass, that's for sure. Claire will definitely give Rory a run for his money.Now with the ending. I'm hoping it's Kellan's story next. There were a lot of hints about what happened to him. Can't wait for the next one. I love this series"}, {"userName": "T.M.

Claire is the healer of her clan and feels the pull of her mates plight. Going to his aid she is kidnapped by dark forces. Rory must fight the poison in his body to help his mate. If a dragon looses his mate it is pure torture.This story has a little bit of everything. It has action, romance (very steamy romance) and humor. Claire is the perfect mate for Rory. She gives as good as she gets. Besides being a good at what he does, Rory is also the comic relief of the guardsmen. When he and Claire meet face to face for the first time Rory is knocked for a loop. He has found the woman the universe has made for him.

Claire has always known that she would come to have a choice of picking a mate in the light or a mate in the dark.

Rory, the jokester of his clan, convinced he would never ever fall in love and be as embarrassing as his brethren, finally meets his match - the question though is, who rescues whom?Love this series, not least because each book can indeed be read as a standalone, as whatever happened before that a reader might miss, there is enough information to be caught up and enjoy the current storyline. And it is always lovely to meet characters from previous books.Great narration style, great characters and a good plot - you cannot wish for more (unless it were a better editor than the one(s) who looked for spelling and grammar errors in this series - missing things like \"they're\" instead of \"there\", for example, or other basic errors like this, really does hurt!)"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67565139-mary", "userReview": "INTERESTING SERIES, BUT BECAME REPETITIVE AFTER A FEW BOOKSAfter reading a few of these, I decided to write one review for all of them.

Rory is the younger brother of Rian and Royce and has given them and his brethren so much loving hassle/crap about their sappiness over their mates, he is so full of life and laughter. He swears he is staying a confirmed bachelor.Then on their last mission into Hell to save his brothers mate Audrey, he is bitten by a HellHound and is slowly dying from the bites toxins.Nothing anyone can do is helping him, his dragon is comatose and Rory prepares himself to die, except there is one person who can save him. Rory is able to hear everything being said and realises the woman coming to save him could be his mate and after visions of her realises Claire is his mate and he gets frantic when he hears she has been taken. Luckily someone realises they have to reverse treat him and it works, saving his life. Read the story you will understand what I mean.Claire is the matriarchal leader of the Clan of the Sun and a very strong shifter in her own right. I am not telling you what she is but boy, big surprise. Along with Claire comes her family and oh my goodness, what wonderful new shifters have come into this series.A prophecy surrounds Claire, the choice between light and dark mates, Claire of course knows there is only one direction she is going to choose, especially after having visions of Rory and how good he is. Claire has known Rory is her mate for a while but believes in letting fate do her thing and in giving Rory time to choose to come find her, but when she knows Rory is in danger she gets on her motorbike and rides to save him.On her way to heal him she never makes it to the lair as planned because the dark griffin who plans to be her mate, kidnaps her. Boy, talk about Mommy issues.I absolutely love all of these characters. Claire is a very interesting character, nothing wallflower about her, she is a badass and another perfect woman to join this crazy group. I wasn't expecting her or her family to be the type of shifters they are and cannot wait to see more of all of them, hopefully as mates to some of the Dragon Guards still single.Claire and Rory are a perfect couple and once again fate has chosen well."}, {"userName": "Melanie-Smokenator", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6389126-melanie-smokenator", "userReview": "WOW! That is what I can say after reading Rory and Claire'ss story. I always knew Rory was an awesomely cool guy - but wow did he just change my mind. Amazingly cool, even staring dead in the eye - this man was still himself. He kept his humour and yet we see his strength as well. Yes, he is the joker and all that, but after going into hell and helping his big brother, Rian, save his mate and getting bitten by a hellhound (yep it will only happen to Rory). To crown it all, Kane, the son of the Celtic Sun God, Lugh, had to get his heart beating again and left his hand as a new tattoo on Rory's chest. And then he was in a coma, where he heard everything happening around him, but he was cut off from all those whom he loved. But all the mushy feelings he will keep as ammunition for the future - that's our Rory. (I loved the way he taunts his beast - but until he was healed our beast was not playing along - and it was funny to see Rory's frustrations.Claire, oh my word. She is awesome.you need to read her side of the story to get to know the baddies. Come on - you know with our Dragons there is never just an easy way. But Claire bought some challenges with her and Rory was not going to take it laying down - literally. Once Rory's beast woke up, it was not easy to keep the dude calm! That beastie wanted to rip the evil ones to pieces - I love Rory's beastie.Claire is strong in her own right, and suits Rory just fine. She shares his humor and his strength. But she as a matriarch of her own Clan she brings with her eons of wisdom and strategy. I adore her.Together they make a formidable team and I can not wait to hear more about them. Claire also bought some family to the story of the aviary shifter kind - and they are just as fun. We see Royce and Kyra as well - and I adore this pair! I can't wait for little Kyra's or Royce's - wait what about some little Rian's, Audrey's, Claire's and I definitely want to see some baby Rory's! PLEASE MISS JULIA!!!And there is Kellan - that male is making my heart bounce. I think I am falling for him because he is just one tough alpha male and I can't wait for his story - which if I am correct we see a bit happening there, Miss Julia?

The griffins seek to mate her to their leader, Malik Slade, without her permission, but she has chosen her mate, and he's a dragon.A man stuck in his own mind, only able to hear what is going on around him. He knows his time is running out, the toxins from the bite of the hellhound are taking their toll on him. He hears his family and friends talk of a woman, possibly another healer, who they are looking for, only to find she has left to go to him, and he also learns that she could be his mate?? Him, the one who always said he would never be mated, might have a mate??
