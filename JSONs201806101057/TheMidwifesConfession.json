I did not expect all the twists and turns of the plot, but they were amazing and kept my anticipation levels soaring. Well done, Ms. Chamberlain! IMHO, you will be hard pressed to find anyone who can rival Diane Chamberlain when it comes to writing women's fiction. Her storylines are always intriguing and pull you in from the very beginning. Her character development is top notch and you feel intimately acquainted and invested in their lives. This story follows three women who met in college over twenty years ago and became the very best of friends. Noelle, the midwife, commits suicide. Her best friends, Emerson and Tara, have no idea what triggered her to end her life. No one saw it coming. As they delve into letters and journals she left behind, what they discover is even more shocking and disturbing news. Emerson and Tara know they need to call the police about their suspicions, but the more they try to figure out the bizarre sequence of the horrific events Noelle was involved with, the more they realize just how wrapped up their own lives are intertwined in the scandals.So many secrets! So many lies! So many great \"Are you kidding me?\" moments!"}, {"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/307208-lucy", "userReview": "I don't even know how to write this without spoilers so consider this your big spoiler alert.Ugh. My apologies to Diane Chamberlain, who I'm sure is a nice woman with lots of ideas and talent, but The Midwife's Confession gives fiction a bad name. I feel rather strongly that fiction has a lot more to offer than escapism or entertainment. I feel its medium is especially suited to teach - namely empathy and understanding for the multitude of life experiences we'll most likely never have as individuals. Additionally, I have learned from Tolstoy and Stagner and Steinbeck and Stockett and many others that no matter our color or religion or age or gender, we are all a lot more similar than it seems. So are our relationships with others. Toss in some history, geography, or any area of expertise (governing, medicine, cooking, sports, kite flying), a few conflicts for flavor, steady it with good writing and better editing, and, voila, you've got yourself some quality fiction. What does not make quality fiction is unbelievable, unlikely and ridiculous drama. Again, those kinds of stories may be entertaining to some but it feels like such a waste of pages and ink to me. What can possibly be the purpose of reading about three women who meet at college and become BFFs and all live in the same town and all still hang out regularly together (unlikely) until one of them unexpectedly commits suicide? Is it likely that those who have been adopted relate to becoming a midwife because they happened to be given to the midwife who delivered them (unbelievable)? Or that they identify with the woman who secretly discovers the names of her birth parents while moving her adoptive mother's furniture because she kept her daughter's birth file in an old swivel chair (unlikely)? Maybe we can glean a bit of that universal human condition by reading about about happens when you accidentally drop your newborn baby niece that was just born to your sister who thinks you're really just her old RA from college turned friend because you were high on prescription drugs that you secretly take due to a back injury from a car accident that happened on the night you slept with your best friend's fiance who you will always love even though he then marries your best friend so you become engaged to his partner but use your old lover as your attorney to arranges the paperwork for the five surrogate children you secretely deliver to help you atone for the fact that you replaced the dead baby that you hid in your purse at the hospital, stealing a baby from a woman in a coma who now has another daughter who needs a bone marrow transplant but now this secret niece of yours who was raised by your secret sister of yours discovers that she is the stolen baby and maybe can save her real sister's life by donating her genetically similar bone marrow? No? And don't get me started on the jolted first person narratives between five or six or seven different women. It's like she didn't know how to write one story so she just changed to have someone narrate when they needed to express how they felt or what was going on in their life or what secret they had. I never really like this style but Chamberlain's use of it felt downright lazy. Like I said - unbelievable, unlikely, ridiculous. Criminal. Stupid."}, {"userName": "Sheree", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1612410-sheree", "userReview": "4.5 stars What a nail-biter! An absolute labyrinth of twists, turns and just when you think you've got it all figured out ... bam another shocking revelation! Ok not all were the unexpected, knock-your-socks-off type revelation, some where the ... damn ... I knew it, kind, but still, quite a gut-wrenching rollercoaster ride. I loved the seamlessly woven alternating narration from key characters and the flashbacks to past events. I loved the complexities of the mother-daughter relationships, I loved the bond between best friends Noelle, Tara & Emerson and I loved Chamberlain's portrayal of their bond following Noelle's suicide. The 'realness' of their feelings; the shock, the guilt, the questions, the anger, the betrayal, the love, the quest for answers, the desire to set things right.Following the death of my mother a long buried secret was uncovered that came as quite a shock to our entire family so many of Tara & Emerson's emotions were also familiar to me. When your knowledge of someone you love is so emphatically challenged it rocks your entire world. The Midwife's Confession is a powerful and moving landscape of love, friendship, grief, suicide, lies, guilt, & life-shattering secrets.If you're hankering for an extremely compelling read with a poignant depth of emotion and a blistering pace then don't miss out on this one!"}, {"userName": "Maria Espadinha", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20749430-maria-espadinha", "userReview": "Nem Confiss\u00e3o Nem ParteiraComo sei que muitos leitores chumbaram de imediato este livro, logo que deram de caras com as palavras \"confiss\u00e3o\" e \"parteira\", quero come\u00e7ar por dizer que esta escolha de t\u00edtulo n\u00e3o foi das mais felizes.Isto porque \"parteira\" cheira a maternidade, partos, rec\u00e9m-nascidos...e de facto este livro pouco tem a ver com isso.Quanto a mim, faria mais sentido intitul\u00e1-lo \"O segredo da carta inacabada\", pois foi esse o catalisador de toda a intriga.Bem...findo este pre\u00e2mbulo que dedico especialmente aos que torceram o nariz \u00e0 \"confiss\u00e3o\" e \u00e0 \"parteira\", irei ent\u00e3o debru\u00e7ar-me sobre aquele que considero ser o fulcro desta est\u00f3ria:O grande tema desta narrativa \u00e9 a Amizade!Os nossos la\u00e7os, as liga\u00e7\u00f5es que contra\u00edmos ao longo da vida s\u00e3o como que prolongamentos do nosso Eu, envolvendo-nos numa teia que constitui um N\u00f3s que simultaneamente nos abarca e transcendeSempre que algum fio dessa teia se quebra e solta, esse N\u00f3s estremece e vacila na sua totalidade.

I have to. I read the reviews on here and thought it would be better than the last one I read, but it was not. Stop reading now if you don't want spoilers.In this story Noelle is a midwife and she has a lot of secrets. She also has two best friends, Emerson and Tara. One night, for reasons that no one knows Noelle ends her own life. This leads Emerson and Tara on a quest to find out what was going on with their good friend. Noelle was hiding a lot. They had all been friends for 20 years and somehow she managed to hide five pregnancies, her love for Tara's husband, that she is really Emerson's half sister and she accidentally dropped a baby and switched it to cover it up. I still do not understand what Noelle being in love with Sam had to do with the rest of the story. I felt like it was just thrown in there and had no reason. I could have lived without that story line. There was PLENTY going on without it. The five pregnancies were also not needed. She was secretly a surrogate five times and, while I understand the author was trying to show she was doing it to pay a penance it just seemed a bit over the top. I want to like Chamberlain's books, I really do. She writes such great characters, but then she just piles on so much they get lost in it all. It would have been a compelling story to just have Noelle commit suicide, have Emerson be the secret half sister and deal with the death of her infant and switch of the baby. All the other things that were going was just more than the book needed.

To this day, I remain impacted by its story and the historical issues I learned about. So needless to say, I jumped at the chance to read another one of Ms. Chamberlain's women's fiction novels! I know it's unfair to compare an author's books, but as a reader with a fair amount of natural expectation, I can't help it. My reading experience with The Midwife's Confession was good... but I was hoping for awesome. I'm not sure if there were too many past and present characters/storylines or if I just wasn't connecting with the characters the way I have with other books (maybe a combination of the two), but my lack of investment definitely affected my overall enjoyment. However, let me add that I was genuinely intrigued by the mystery element in this novel and my heart was hurting when I heard what the midwife's confession actually was. At around the thirty to forty percent mark I thought I had it all figured out and was a bit insulted Ms. Chamberlain would write a story that was so predictable, but oh was I wrong. There were definitely some revelations I didn't see coming and that's always fun. Despite any negativity written in this review, I would recommend The Midwife's Confession to others who enjoy women's fiction with some family drama and mystery elements. Even though I didn't love it, I did like it and there's nothing wrong with that :)My favorite quote:\"There's no big mystery to it Noelle. Doctors today would like you to think that there is. They make you think you need drugs and C-sections, that's surgery that cuts the baby out of you, and all sorts of sophisticated interventions to have a baby. And sometimes you do. A good midwife needs to know when it's safe for a woman to have a baby at home and when it's not. But it's not rocket science.\""}, {"userName": "Love Fool", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29084789-love-fool", "userReview": "Dear Anna,What I have to tell you is difficult to write, but I know it will be far more difficult for you to hear, and I'm so sorry-The unfinished letter is the only clue Tara and Emerson have to the reason behind their close friend Noelle's suicide.

She is talented, coming up with creative and heartbreaking stories that will stick with you for a few days. The Midwife's Confession is one that puts fear into you, making you think of \"what if this happens to me\" throughout the book. Diane also has a talent of making you feel bad for a character, even with all her faults.I highly recommend this book if you have a long commute, because you will not want to stop reading this book.

It's always interesting to read. However Diane Chamberlain certainly knows how to overdo it. This was SO dramatic. There were so many twists and a lot of them were unnecessary. A few of the dramatic elements didn't actually add a single thing to the book. The book reminded me of Desperate Housewives or Devious Maids, it was THAT dramatic. The characters were okay. I felt like Ermerson, Noelle and Tara were done the best. The rest of the characters all felt a little one-dimensional. I think Diane Chamberlain focused too much on how to make the story dramatic and unpredictable rather than focus on how to make the characters seem real. It had a nice enough pace but I felt like it was dragged out a bit. It didn't need to be over 400 pages long. I guessed the ending so it wasn't unpredictable but there were a few things thrown in the book that I hadn't predicted.The strongest thing about this was the main storyline (without all the waffle). If Diane Chamberlain just cut out some of the drama, it would have been much better... then again she wouldn't have much of a book. Bits of it were also painfully coincidental just so Diane Chamberlain could weave the story the way she wanted. I mean a coincidence once or twice, okay, but a bunch of coincidences is not okay. Even though there was a lot to dislike, I actually did enjoy this book. There were a few rare moments when I felt like I was getting a great insight into a character that seemed real and I liked that. I would read another book by Diane Chamberlain again. I would only recommend this book to readers who like lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of drama (like a lot)."}, {"userName": "Samantha March", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4681357-samantha-march", "userReview": "I love giving five stars, and the latest novel by Diane Chamberlain earns them all. The Midwife\u2019s Confession is a tangled story of friendship and love, secrets and betrayal, and realistic characters that will make you cry while you see their story unfold. Tara, Emerson, and Noelle have been friends for years, but when Noelle commits suicide, leaving behind only an unfinished note, Tara and Emerson find out they might not have truly known their friend. The complex mystery that surrounds not only Noelle\u2019s death, but Noelle\u2019s life before her suicide drives the woman to put the pieces together. But when Noelle\u2019s secrets are finally revealed, Tara and Emerson are in for a heart-wrenching discovery. This novel was near impossible to put down. I loved trying to figure out the mystery alongside Tara and Emerson, and there were several occasions that I thought I had it all pieced together. I was never even close. The compelling drama indeed made me cry, and left me a bit unsettled at the end, but I loved it all the same. I know I said something similar in my review of Chamberlain\u2019s The Lies We Told, but I was unsettled for a different reason. I don\u2019t want to give a lot away here, but it was because there was a mystery surrounding Noelle and Tara\u2019s deceased husband.

It kept me guessing what would happen next, and I just could not put the book down. The Midwife's Confession has some really good, strong characters. It is the story of three friends - Tara, Emerson, and Noelle. Tara, recently widowed and trying to put her life back together, was my favorite. I enjoyed the friend ship between she and Emerson. I also really liked the secondary character of Anna Knightley, a strong woman who has faced the disappearance of an infant, the desertion of her husband, and the illness of her remaining daughter. The characters all tied together in surprisng ways. This was a very well written book, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.Tara, Emerson, and Noelle have been close friends since their college days. After Tara is suddenly widowed, her friends provide support and help her and her daughter pick up the pieces of their lives. Tara and Emerson are both blindsighted when Noelle suddenly commits suicide. As they pack up Noelle's belongings, they are stunned by the pieces of her life that they uncover. They suddenly realize that she had shattering secrets, and that they didn't really know her. Noelle's secrets send both of them reeling and threaten what they know about their own lives. Tara and Emerson must find a way to deal with Noelle's secrets and their ramifications.This was a compelling book that held my interest from the beginning. The story is told from the point of view of several different characters, and that worked well. Each time I thought I had figured out all of the connections, the author would throw in another surprise.

This was amazing! I zoomed thought this book of firm friendship and tragic secrets. There were almost so many secrets, that it wasn't realistic. But I don't care, I still loved this. I have no idea how someone would deal with this situation, it would be heart breaking.  I would recommend if you are a fan of Picoult, this is actually better than some books I've read by her recently."}, {"userName": "momruncraft", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/862171-momruncraft", "userReview": "One of the best books I have read this year. Diane Chamberlain writes in the same style as Jodi Picoult; however, the twists, turns, and drama are never forced, obvious, or far-fetched. I got this book yesterday afternoon and absolutely devoured it. I couldn't put it down. I found myself sneaking away from the boys to read a chapter and then stayed up far too late finishing it.As with many of her books, just when you think you've got it figured out Chamberlain throws you another curveball. And then another. Much of this book hits close to home. Giving birth is one of the most life changing, life altering experiences I have ever gone through. I would have been completely lost without the amazing nurses and doctors at my side. It is a relationship built on trust. And humilty: woman parts out in the open changes a lot of things. I wholeheartedly trusted that they would help me bring my boys into the world and never questioned that. I realize a relationship with a midwife and home birth is vastly different; however, Chamberlain brings up the question of whether or not you ever really know a person. How much do really know about the person you ask to help you bring your baby into the world?Emerson and Tara have built a strong friendship with their college RA, Noelle. One that continues long after they graduate from college. Noelle goes on to follow in her mother's footsteps as a midwife and is there for Emerson and Tara when they give birth to their daughters. Following what seems to be a shocking suicide, Emerson and Tara learn that they knew nothing about their dear friend, Noelle. Nothing at all. The woman who they trusted with their lives and the lives of their daughters turns out to be hiding secrets that will change their lives completely. And turn their worlds upside down."}, {"userName": "Sabrina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34942643-sabrina", "userReview": "I almost marked it as two stars, as I wanted to like it much more than I did. I don't mind knowing what's going to happen early on in the plot, but when it is so obvious, and the author pounds you over the head with clues, but then leads up to a big \"Ta-da!\" moment, it just leaves me cold. I also didn't connect with the characters the way you need to when you have such an intimate portrait of people's lives. However, the writing made it readable, despite my lack of emotional connection.** Just marked it down to two stars, tried explaining why I didn't enjoy the story to my DH, and realized it's like that quote about trying to believe 6 imposible things before breakfast-only not in a good way. I just didn't buy all the contrived plot twists.***Took it down one more notch, I can't get this book out of my head, and not in a good way. Now I'm just generally peeved about the whole plot. Sincerely wish I hadn't finished this."}, {"userName": "S\u00f3nia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10423285-s-nia", "userReview": "3,5*Embora a dada altura me tenha sensibilizado com partes da est\u00f3ria achei-a demasiado rocambolesca.

When Noelle, a former midwife, commits suicide, Tara and Emerson are left wondering why. As they investigate, they learn things that make them question if they ever really knew Noelle at all.I am not sure I have the words to describe how powerfully emotional this story is. Chapter 15 and 16 left me crying and needing a break. I was completely unprepared for the direction the story began to take. The synapsis doesn't even begin to touch the whole story.The remainder of the book was a roller coaster of emotion. The author did an amazing job at creating characters that suck you in. I felt like I was a part of their world, and suffered along with them at every new twist and revelation.Normally, book reviews tell you who would likely enjoy the story. I will take the opposite approach and warn off a few readers. Not that you wouldn't enjoy the story, but it might be a bit too emotional to handle:- if you're pregnant or have a newborn- if you've recently experienced the death of a loved oneThat being said, this is definitely an amazing story, and Diane did a great job telling it. I can see myself reading it again, just to see if I can pick up any little hints about the outcome that I didn't see the first time."}, {"userName": "Leila", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15194189-leila", "userReview": "This is the first book I have read by Diane Chamberlain and not an easy one to review. The synopsis sounded really interesting so I decided to give it a try. Every chapter is told from the point of view of one of the characters which seemed fine at first but for me became ore and more confusing towards the end of the book. Initially I was intrigued by what was going on and keen to carry on. I try not to bring spoilers into my reviews,so sufficient to say that there are many twists and turns within the plot, perhaps too many... which held my interest until about two thirds into the story I found myself losing interest as it all became more and more complex. I found the last part of the book very rushed and over emotional. The men in the story don't really figure much at all. The story is based in the fact that we never really know others as well as we think no matter how close we have been and often when the truth does come out it leaves a whole mess of shattered illusions and heartbreak. I didn't take to Noelle at all and found the interaction between the other characters becoming more emotional and unbelievable as the story unfolded.Overall it's an ok book but I was disappointed after an intriguing beginning. I do have another of her books to read so perhaps this second one will live up to all the many praises for this author's work."}, {"userName": "Marleen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616365-marleen", "userReview": "How many secrets can one person have, I wonder. At the beginning of this captivating story, we are confronted with the mysterious suicide of a woman \u2013 named Noelle, who was single and a midwife by trade.Page after page, and told through the eyes of her best friends, Tara and Emerson, we discover that Noelle kept more than just one secret. Honestly, she had many. I admit I thought that was all a bit much for one woman to withhold from her friends, but then it lends itself to a compelling & entertaining story-telling.True, I didn't like Noelle \u2013 she might have seen wonderful to her friends, but I didn't see it. We get to know her a little through flash-backs. And no \u2013 I didn't detect any sign of remorse. Another character that immensely irritated me was sixteen year old Grace. For the most part of the book she treated her Mom (Tara) with disrespect. Why not write about teenagers who know kindness? They are out there. For that matter, I totally adored Haley, the twelve-year old daughter of Anna Knightly; that little girl was a trooper, suffering from leukemia and still so brave and upbeat.What I enjoyed best was the intrigue and the plot \u2013 discovering what Noelle had done - not only to, but for her friends \u2013 was not only baffling, but it was also provocative.
