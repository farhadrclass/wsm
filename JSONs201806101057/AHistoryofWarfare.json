A cultural history of war from antiquity to the present day in a single volume. Keegan starts with the symbolic forms of war among the so called \"primitives,\" including those from the neolithic, using much archaeological evidence to do so. He then moves on to the advent of the chariot by the ancient Thracians and Egyptians, and its eventual supersession by the compound-bow wielding horse peoples from the Eurasian steppes (Huns, Mongols, Magyars, et. al). Then the subsequent heyday of mounted cavalry whose hold over various cultures (Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, etc.) was so strong it meant their undoing once gunpowder arrived. That's a constant refrain here, warriors stuck in outdated modes of warfare that ensure their demise. For example, there's the discussion of fortification and its ability to sustain long seiges, and how this all changed in the gunpowder era and led to radically different designs. Much discussion too on the disposition of troops in the field (the Greek phalanx, the Napoleonic manouever, etc.), methods of logistics and supply, evolution of naval warfare (from the Greek trireme to the modern ironclad) etc. In the end the book constitutes a methodical disproving of Clausewitz. To wit,War is not the continuation of policy by other means. The world would be a simpler place to understand if this dictum of Clausewitz's were true. Clausewitz, a Prussian veteran of the Napoleonic wars who used his years of retirement to compose what was destined to become the most famous book on war\u2014called On War\u2014ever written, actually wrote that war is the continuation \"of political intercourse\" (des politischen Verkehrs) \"with the intermixing of other means\" (mit Einmischung anderer Mittel). The original German expresses a more subtle and complex idea than the English words in which it is so frequently quoted. In either form, however, Clausewitz's thought is incomplete. It implies the existence of states, of state interests and rational calculation about how they may be achieved. Yet war antedates the state, diplomacy and strategy by many millennia.Keegan's solution for moving beyond the culturally limited and blinkered view of Clausewitz is fascinating. I've read the book twice, which should be praise enough."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason", "userReview": "Wow. Do not go head-to-head with this erudite military historian.Sweeping in its range--from 6000 BC fertile crescent to Cold War mutually assured destruction; inclusive in its coverage--from the Manchu in North Korea to the Mamelukes in Egypt to the Yanomamo in Brazil; comprehensive in its topics--from stone to flesh to iron to fire. This is truly a history of warfare.As a member of the military, I was introduced, taught to memorize, encouraged to stress, and told to believe the tenants of the putative father of warfare, Carl von Clausewitz. Clausewitz argues that warfare is 'the extension of politics by other means,' and John Keegan begins his History of Warfare by laying out the tools by which he will utterly destroy that thesis. Modern western military treats Clausewitzian theory as hallowed and consecrated as the Shroud of Turin. However, I've always had the sneaking suspicion that a single theory of warfare, held unequivocally, had to be in error. Keegan simply gives me the arguments to defend this suspicion of mine.There's nothing incorrect about Clausewitz' theories. However, Keegan uses dozens of cultural examples of warfare to show that, instead of being universal, Clausewitz' theories are only appropriate to a certain time in history, specific to a particular kind of warfighter, and applicable to a unique set of resolves from the warring nations. Keegan makes a parting appeal to Western military not to fall victim to tenants of warfare that today seem immutable. These may merely be in favor to a Western way of warfare, but could change based on a number of events.The take-away from this book is Keegan's methodical progress through the turning points in the history of warfare. He underscores the warfare utility of animal domestication, the chariot, fortifications, the warhorse, the phalanx, and gunpowder. He discusses the unique implications of culture on warfare technique, tactics, and procedures. Each warfighting organization was dominant in its time and area based on a unique set of guiding, cultural principles. The Zulus, the Magyars--Vikings, Spartans, Huns; the Roman legions, the British navy--Samurai, Aztec, Ottomans; all practiced a kind of warfare that was born of a logical accumulation of regional technology, culture, and exposure to adjacent warfighters. Meanwhile, Keegan's encyclopedic knowledge of all things warfare allows him to effortlessly draw parallels between cultures separated by thousands of years, and to find worthwhile links in strategy embodied by militaries as diverse from one another as Mongols and the US Confederacy, conquistidores and the German luftwaffe. Keegan begins with an intriguing denial of Clausewitz, and seems to set this as his overall theme. However, he often writes for up to 50 pages without revisiting his theme. He offers a well written chronology of warfare, but rarely makes the connection between it and Clausewitz. I believe the book would have been more focused if Keegan's theme was mentioned within each chapter, or as he calls them, interludes. Instead, we have a history of warfare that begins and ends with a conversation about Clausewitz, but little reference in between. I'm left learning a lot about warfare, but without an overriding theme, the breadth of this book is too much for only 490+ pages. It ultimately reads as a glancing--though scholarly--review of the highlights of warfare. 4 stars for a balanced, skilled review of the fundamental movements of 8000 years of warfare. No more than 4 stars because this is the abridged Britannica of warfare, should have been longer or more focused, and could have been the seminal book to deny Clausewitz."}, {"userName": "Mike Edwards", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6909775-mike-edwards", "userReview": "A horrid book for two reasons. First, Keegen willfully misrepresents Clausewitz. Clausewitz argues that warfare takes place within a political context, and is, in fact completely defined by that political context: hence \"war is a continuation of politics by another means\". Keegan attacks Clausewitz for advocating warfare as a rational way for countries to settle their differences; a position that Clausewitz never takes, because Clausewitz is very clearly describing what is, no what should be. For Clausewitz, war is a tool of political leaders, albeit an especially dangerous and unpredictable one. Keegan's version of Clausewitz is incredibly skewed, which makes his frequent attacks on Clausewitz largely non-sensical.Second, Keegan's own analysis of warfare relies heavily on his belief that warfare is the result of an outpouring of passion and emotion. Certainly emotion plays a role in warfare, both in the progress of particular battles and in the decision to go to war in the first place. But Keegan overstates his case, so much so that he cannot explain why peace ever breaks out."}, {"userName": "Milo\u0219 Dumbraci", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53468886-milo-dumbraci", "userReview": "By no means a \u201dHistory of Warfare\u201d (and that title is a cheating of the buyer), the book is also not even a book in itself, but just an overgrown academic pompous 400 pages essay with no structure or clear idea of what it wants and where it goes.

In Clausewitz's view war is a practical violence, like a game of chess played with meat. Perhaps sometimes it is, but it is also otherwise \u2014 a practice at odds with the goals of those who would be its master, an anachronism preserved against innovation in the ways we kill, and perhaps ultimately something mankind has perfected beyond suitability as means to any human goal.The technology of war is well accounted in this book, as are the intertwined attitudes and beliefs of the warriors that utilized the tech. Ways of thinking, how humans conjugate into the deploy of war, those are innovations as well."}, {"userName": "Gary Foss", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15798988-gary-foss", "userReview": "I read this book back when it came out and picked it up again just to see if I'd find it as enlightening now, 20 years on, as I did when I first read it.As an overview of the world history of war and conflict, Keegan does an admirable job. By necessity in a book in which large swaths of history are being described, any number of details and conflicts will be ignored or given short shrift. The particulars of African warfare are dealt with by describing the Zulu under Shaka, which makes as much sense as any other of the war leaders used as the paradigms to describe the \"war as culture\" theme Keegan strives for with this over-arching summary of human history. In many ways, his text is more \"An Anthropology of Warfare\" than a history of it. The author takes pains to describe the cultural values that those leaders represent in broader terms, the exceptional military leaders of the past become the paradigms through which his premise is presented. As a result, the book has all of the merits and some of the failings to which \"Big Man\" history often succumbs. Though he masters the strengths of that focus, Keegan appears generally unaware or unable to address the weaknesses. His focus on Shaka as the stand-in for African cultural warfare means that the lower intensity warfare of the centuries that precede the rise of that leader and the decline of centralization that came after get little attention in this book, though\u2014given the \"war as culture\" theme\u2014they really should be recognized as the backbone of his premise. Keegan does not ignore them entirely, but they are less spectacular and simply get less attention. It's hard to conclude, therefore, that his premise (that the methods and means of war are a function of culture rather than politics) is entirely substantiated. Culture is broader than those leaders, even if we take them as the proverbial tip of the spear rather than\u2014probably more accurately\u2014aberrations produced by cultures in crisis.However, Keegan's real target is really Carl Philipp Gottfried von Clausewitz and the dictum \"War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.\" It is to refute that idea that the \"war as culture\" concept primarily functions in this book. Keegan acknowledges that his predecessor's thesis has been mistranslated from the original, often misinterpreted, and generally misapplied, but also holds von Clausewitz responsible for the extremes that those who used that term to justify their actions would go to in later centuries. How responsible von Clausewitz (or any theorist) actually is for those who used his language to justify their actions is highly debatable. The world is rife with philosophical constructs and pseudo-ethics that can be used to rationalize the full range of human behaviors. Nonetheless, Keegan is right in his assessment of the errors involved in both the original concept as von Clausewitz imagined it, and the thinking of those who took the idea to such absurd levels of intellectual depravity as to lead their nations into orgies of genocide, suicide and slaughter.In doing so, Keegan gives a substantial, if necessarily limited, view of the cultural origins of warfare going back to its tribal manifestation up to the first Gulf War. The book is well worth reading for those who want an introduction to the study of the history of war on that basis alone. Keegan does occasionally struggle with his own preconceptions, but I'd argue less so than many other working historians, and we as readers can be perhaps more forgiving of his intellectual limitations than he is of others\u2014particularly von Clausewitz. Likewise, we should take some of the historians that he quotes and references with skepticism. Victor Hanson, for instance, figures prominently among those Keegan cites, and it's clear that he more often than not agrees with his colleague. Hanson is a controversial figure on a number of levels, and having read a few of his books in the years between first reading A History of Warfare and this re-read, I have many more reservations about his ideas than Keegan appears to have had. So, if one is inclined to take certain components of this book with a grain of salt, there are sections where the salt needs to be applied more thickly.In this reading, I'm less convinced that Keegan's reboot of \"war is politics\" into \"war is culture\" idea is substantially more valuable or less prone to twisting out of shape than von Clauswitz. Were the same powers of mistranslation, misinterpretation and rationalization applied to Keegan as he notes were applied to von Clauswitz, the results could very well be the same, and some future historian might pen a world history in which he presents a rival thesis to refute Keegan. Furthermore, in some respects the warnings that Keegan makes regarding the dangers of modern war, as well as his hopeful predictions for the future are problematic given the events in the years since this book was published. However, many of the fundamental ideas he expresses remain valid, and at the very least the idea that war is a product of the cultures that engage in it apply to his writing as well. Keegan is a product of his time\u2014a brief hiatus after the fall of the Soviets and the constant state of low-grade conflict that is the post-9/11 international War on Terror. But those events don't necessarily invalidate his points. In fact, in many ways we can still see them as ideals that need to be expressed."}, {"userName": "notabattlechick", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15981305-notabattlechick", "userReview": "Upon re-reading. This book still confounds me. One one hand, culture! Yes! On the other hand, the willful(?) misreading of Clausewitz and the insistence on going 12 rounds with the Prussian is problematic. There's room for both, you know. Clausewitz certainly must be contextualize - to quote John Lynn, \"Clausewitz is culture!\" Further, Keegan's conclusion that humans are moving from an \u201cundoubtedly warlike past towards [a] potentially peaceful future\u201d strikes me as ludicrous on the face of it. This doesn't seem to be the world I am living in. To claim that culture predates and thus has primacy over \"politics\" is wrongheaded and doesn't get us very far. Keegan's cooperativst view of human nature will also strike many as problematic - though at least this is a subject for serious debate.Military historians must be familiar with the work - it is an \"Important.\" book, but I'd be wary of using it too heavily for theoretical foundation or scholarly citation (other than in a historiographical context). The work is synthetic - go to the original arguments and sources. I fear, though, that lay readers and non-specialists will be seduced by Keegan's arguments - 'tis a shame."}, {"userName": "Anthony Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7151669-anthony-ryan", "userReview": "Renowned military historian John Keegan succeeds admirably in the difficult task of providing a coherent narrative for humanity's age-old proclivity for armed conflict.

Flicking through I saw that he delved into the debate about the Yanomamo, and Chagnon's extremely contested anthropological research in that community - concluding that this was an innately warlike people. This is an area that I find fascinating, so I put the book on my to-read list.Keegan tackles Clausewitz's dictum, that war is the continuation of politics by other means (a reductive translation, as it happens). Most of the GR reviews of the book either take issue or agree with this aspect of it. But I was disappointed. Keegan's main interest is in the tactics, weapons and defensive constructions that people bring to the game when they fight. How culture affects the choices of said tactics, weapons etc. So it's not really about why people fight, but what they do once they find themselves on the battlefield. How can you tackle Clausewitz if you are not actually dealing with the decision-making path that leads to war?Finally - gosh this is not an easy read. Really hard to pinpoint why. The prose is just dense and opaque. Most sentences are not as convuluted as this: The means that general staffs had convinced governments would ensure peace and, if war broke out, bring victory - ever wider recruitment of men, ever costlier purchases of arms - had cancelled each other out.But it gives an indication as to why you might get bogged down in his sentences (too bad I chose this as one of my \"teach myself to speed read\" books).And it suffers from compression. An overview of wars, across history, and across the world, in 400 pages? So you get a description of Alexander vs Darius at Gaugamela, with the decisive manoevre summed up in two sentences. I didn't get it. Maybe a more knowledgeable military historian would.But give the man his due. It is genuinely fascinating to learn about how war-making has developed over the centuries - most importantly, in overcoming soldiers' natural cowardice. It's not surprising that in pre-industrial times, as far back as we can trace in fact, people went into war not wanting to die, engaging tentatively then retreating if a decisive blow had not been struck, never fighting unto death. War was even ritualised to avoid excessive casualties. At some point soldiers were trained to throw themselves in overwhelming numbers against the enemy and fight until one or the other side won. Clearly a fearsome prospect to face on the battlefield and it's no surprise that this tactic became widely popular. Some peoples though were slower than others in adopting it."}, {"userName": "Chris Chester", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2660837-chris-chester", "userReview": "It all starts with the great Clausewitzian statement that war is the continuation of politics by other means.Keegan spends 500 exhaustive pages thoroughly and methodically demolishing that supposition. By exploring every form of warfare from ceremonial tribal forms of battle all the way through modern Mutually Assured Destruction, he argues that for most of human history, warfare is characterized by ritual, caution, aversion, and brevity.It is only the specifically modern, western forms of warfare that inherit the especially toxic combination of ideologically-driven, face-to-face combat with the fruits of technological development. Modern western warfare is thus the lethal continuation of politics, total war, but it is peculiar for all that.While the work is interesting for its sweeping analysis of the forms of combat throughout history, it's difficult to stay engaged in the work when you don't have much investment in Clausewitz, as one imagines members of modern officer corps might."}, {"userName": "Nicholas Jasper", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20922587-nicholas-jasper", "userReview": "This is a book to studied and to be read more than once. Keegan makes the case that we will eventually just plain, damn outgrow war much as children outgrow diapers. Keegan equates war with other infantile behavior like slavery and human sacrifice. Keegan takes his time coming to his conclusion. He first has to sail round the world and across the centuries to document the different types of warfare (it is likely that people from all societies are taken aback by the word \"types\") ; I believe that he lists eight types. Although war IS childish and insane it is important and it has shaped our history. Keegan dissects war much like an anthropologist would analyze the various religions of the world. His argument is that it is not something that we HAVE to do or that has any basis in rationality, it is something that we have done and will continue until we, at last, outgrow it.

He is not a fan of Clausewitz's ideas, and a large part of the book focuses on counterarguments to Clausewitz's ideas, Keegan draws on many counterexamples where war is not  a continuation of politics with other means (ritualistic war - marauding war, the Zulu style where politics became the continuation of continuous warfare, etc., pp.). A large part of the beginning of the book is reserved to show how Clausewitz's ideas are not general and are much more a product of Clausewitz's upbringing and indoctrination from the Prussian military system (where war was, mostly, seen as a continuation of politics, which to Keegan is rather rare in human history).After that it becomes a proper straightforward history, starting with prehistoric societies, the Greeks, then the Roman empire etc. pp., over the World Wars to today's nuclear threat (nuclear war is also not Clausewitzian war as it is the end of politics). It is all tremendously well-researched and dense - the role of war in the creation of borders and nationstates is discussed (the invention of cannons made forts necessary, which is then where borders settled), there's an entire subchapter on the importance of transport and logistics in wartime, how the structure of armies changed over time, and so on. It's all here.His writing at times reminded me of German, very, very long sentences with many subordinate clauses:With an officer corps of the quality represented by Ligustinus, formed of men whose life was soldiering, who entertained no expectation of rising into the governing class, and whose ambitions were entirely limited to those of success within what could be perceived, for the first time in history, as an esteemed and self-sufficient profession, it is not surprising that Rome\u2019s boundaries came to be extended from the Atlantic to the Caucasus; it succeeded, by whatever means, in transforming the warrior ethos of a small city state into a true military culture, an entirely novel Weltanschauung, one shared by the highest and the lowest levels of Roman society, but rooted in and expressed through the values of a separate and subordinate corporation of specialists.See? Not the stuff you read at the beach.Bonus-quote on 'non-white' Roman soldiers, which caused a bit of a fuss on the more boring parts of the Internet recently:In a remarkable survey that was made of the careers of ten Roman soldiers who died in the service of the empire during the first two centuries AD, as revealed by their gravestones, we find a cavalryman from Mauritania (modern Morocco) who died on Hadrian\u2019s Wall; the standard-bearer of the II Legio Augusta, born at Lyon, who died in Wales; a centurion of the X Legio Gemina, born at Bologna, who was killed in Germany at the disaster of the Teutoburg forest; a veteran of the same legion born near the headwaters of the Rhine, who died on the Danube at modern Budapest; and a legionary of the II Legio Adiutrix, born in modern Austria, who died at Alexandria.57 Perhaps the most touching of funerary records that show how widely the legions were recruited comes from the gravestones of a wife and her soldier husband found at opposite ends of Hadrian\u2019s Wall: she was a local girl; he had been born in Roman Syria."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2527265-david", "userReview": "Aldous Huxley said an intellectual was a person who had discovered something more interesting than sex.

So this book seemed to be a good fit, as the title promised a general survey and the writer was rumored to be far more readable for the lay person than the average for this field.I am sad to report that this is not a book to be read casually on the bus or at bedtime, as I do.

But, to fully appreciate the force and implications of this argument, and to intelligently agree or disagree, I would have actually read Clausewitz, his defenders, and his critics, which I haven't, because (see above) I'm a non-expert looking for an explanation about how warfare works and thought a book called A History of Warfare might fill the bill.But still, when a person can carve out a good chunk of time to really sit down and give this book the attention is deserves, it pays off. Keegan is just a great writer. He is excited by his topic and wants you to be too. Perhaps it's not right to say \u201cKeegan can't write a dull sentence\u201d, but my feeling was that, if you ever caught him at it, he'd be deeply ashamed.

John Keegan is able to paint a fairly good picture of where aggression--warfare, as we call it now--came from by analyzing the findings of anthropologists studying tribal people. He is then able to move us forward by logically filling in the gaps between that stage and the point where recorded history begins. All of this is done in a very academic way, which makes for a very interesting read, but perhaps one that is a little over-complicated.As I went through the book, there were a few flaws that I noticed, though. Most of these revolve around the overall Euro-centric viewpoint adopted by the author. Even though he refers to archaeology done in southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle-east and South America, he tends to skim over the intracacies of these cultures and focuses on how they relate to European war-making. This Euro-centricity is pervasive, but not necessarily surprising considering his background and the declared aims of the book. That aim is basically to refute the claim in Carl von Clausewitz's claim in On War that \"War is a continuation of politics by other means.\" I was convinced by the time I finished the book, but it almost felt as though Keegan was beating the reader over the head with his point.The second point I need to bring up is the use of language. This book is not for a casual reader. It is probably required reading in some universities, and the language reflects that level. I listened to the audiobook, and I probably listened to the entire book one and a half times, because I had to hit the rewind button so many times. It is interesting. It is a very good read. But it is very dense. Anyone who does not have a university degree might find themselves scratching their heads at some of the writing, unless the reader is very accustomed to heavy academic writing. That being said, I enjoyed this book quite a lot. It brought up a lot of points that I had never considered before, and conveyed a strong message about what warfare has become and why."}, {"userName": "Jake", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/972904-jake", "userReview": "I decided to read this one after listening to a course on Military History from the Teaching Company. I've always had a fondness for military history, and figured that this would expand my knowledge and baseline.This book turned out to be a bit more than I expected, though not in a bad way. More than just a military history, Keegan's History of Warfare is an attack against the Clausewitzian notion that \"war is a continuation of politics by other means\". Instead, Keegan argues that war is a cultural phenomenon, and that culture, not politics, is one of the driving forces behind warfare.The book itself is broken up into five main sections: War in Human History, Stone, Flesh, Iron, and Fire. These are separated by smaller sub-chapters, Limitations on War-making, Fortification, Armies, and Logistics and Supply. In each section, Keegan examines the history of warfare as it relates to a particular technology or development (the Flesh chapter, for example, focuses a great deal on the Steppe nomad cultures).The scope of this book is, not surprisingly, quite wide. Keegan is trying to cover the history of warfare throughout the globe, which necessitates a superficial look at any particular conflict. Readers interested in an in-depth look at any particular conflict would be better served by looking at something else. On the flip side, this book is intellectually rigorous enough to not quite qualify as \"light reading\". This book is not a \"History Channel\" summary of battles and conflicts; Keegan is seeking to illustrate a particular idea, and much of his discussion and writing is focused on that notion. If you're not into military history, or if you are simply looking for a quick and dirty summary of some battles, this book will not serve you well at all.Personally, I enjoyed the book and found reading it quite valuable. A very brief web search indicates that the book is a source of some controversy among historians, which means nothing except that it was published and some historians read it. Given Keegan's widespread popularity as a writer of military history, I think that anyone interested in the subject would find reading this worthwhile.

Keegan picks representative civilizations in each era and shows how their culture/environment shaped their concept of war and the way it was carried out (eg. the mobile cavalry of ancient steppe-nomads or the tight formations and the pitched battle to death of the classical Greeks).The approach has the downside of not offering a truly comprehensive history - for example, of all the post-ancient African civilizations, the book covers the Zulus of Shaka only.

I wish however that Keegan had focused more on developing this thesis rather than on frequently attacking von Clausewitz (~war as the extension of politics), which got a bit tiring toward the end."}, {"userName": "MT", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26177059-mt", "userReview": "Well like everyone else I began reading A History of Warfare so I could point out the grievous errors of arms and tactics made in fantasy (\"that's not how you swing a halberd!\" etc.) but I came away with so much more. The base that Keegan works off is one of old warhorse Clauzwitz's sayings, and it's one he continually refers back to. Then we're taken on a grand adventure, back to the dawn of time and then ever forward, finding out the hows and whys of so many civilisations and how they settled their disagreements. Of why chariots kicked the everloving piss out of everything, and why the mounted archer hordes eventually petered out after delivering beatdowns to half the globe. A fantastic read.

John Keegan brings an encyclopedic knowledge to bear, but this is not an encyclopedia of warfare. Rather, it is a handful of detailed but crisp and concise essays, taking as their central thesis the explosion of the famous quotation from Clausewitz that war is the continuation of politics by other means. This is a terrific book for anyone interested in the subject. These essays are filled with fascinating details and unexpected connections across millenia of history.

In the end, I believe in his premise that war is not the continuation of policy by other means, like Clausewitz proposed, but as Sun Tzu wrote is a necessary component of governing.

He has written a history of warfare rang from prehistory to the cusp of the 21st century, and global in its outlook. His main contention is that war is primarily an expression of culture, and has as many manifestations as there are variations human culture.He begins with a critique of Clausewitz's theory that war is the continuation of politics by other means. He contends that warriors are different to other men, tribal in their outlook, so we should be suspicious of any theory that equates war with any other activity in human affairs. While connected to economics, diplomacy and politics, it is not identical or even similar to them as it must be fought by men with very different skills. Keegan shrewdly sees that Clausewitz offers \"the thinking officer a convenient philosophical bolt-hole from contemplation of the older, darker and fundamental aspects of his profession.\" Keegan concludes that Clausewitz's conception of warfare as an extension of politics is not so much wrong as incomplete and overly simplistic. It fails at the cultural level, as it fails to account for how much the Western way of waging war was influenced by Western culture, and how much warfare in general is influenced by culture. As I said previously, this is a major premise that runs through the rest of the book. Keegan contends that war is \"always an expression of culture, often a determinant of cultural forms, and in some societies the culture itself.\" He then examines a number of examples that show that total war doesn't necessarily serve political ends (Easter Island and the Zulus) and that culture can significantly influence how war is waged, regardless of political aims (Mameluke slaves and Japanese Samurai). The final conclusion from all of this is that the reasons for waging war, and the method of doing so, are much more complex and ambiguous than Clausewitz's theory suggests.In a very interesting section Keegan then traces the history of military culture in Europe, and how it was influenced by Clausewitz, culminating in the present nuclear age. Keegan contends that the destructive power of modern weapons effectively places a limit on nation's waging war, and may lead to a time when war, like disease, is greatly reduced and limited. This hope strikes me as reflecting an overly optimistic view of human nature, but his historical analysis is nonetheless convincing.He moves on to some preliminaries to his history of warfare itself by pointing out that there have always been limitations on warfare, both permanent (climate, seasons, terrain etc.) and contingent (supply, quartering, equipment etc.) He also points out that warfare has been an almost exclusively male pursuit, and so asks the very relevant question, why do men fight? This section begins with a discussion of whether violence is part of human nature (I believe it is inherent to fallen human nature) and how this question has been approached by anthropology as part of the attempt to understand human culture generally. Keegan contends that warfare has a much greater influence on culture than the humanities have generally acknowledged. He then examines the approach to warfare of a number of contemporary and historical primitive people groups, which can be taken as reasonably representative of early human warfare generally. The general conclusion is that early warfare was ritualised to a very high degree and that there was a lack of emphasis on killing the enemy, or even of victory in a way that we would recognise. He also points out that cultural constraints limited the potential for Clausewitzian total war to a very marked degree; the section on the Aztecs was particularly memorable here.The book then moves to the history of warfare proper, and is consistently fascinating and engaging. Warfare began with the sporadic violence of the earliest stone age hunter gatherers, and intensified as they clashed with early agriculturalists. The history of the earliest empires, Sumer and Egypt, are traced, along with a very interesting extended discussion on the development of fortifications. The first significant revolution in warfare, with resultant major disruption to civilisation, came in the form of the chariot, employed by various pastoral people groups who were often militarily formidable but still existed below the military horizon, in other words not having a separate military class and professional army as we would recognise it. The analysis of cultural factors (capacity to endure hardship and the willingness and skill in killing that is inherent to a pastoral life) and technology (domestication and improvement through selective breeding of the horse, invention of the chariot and the composite bow) that resulted in these formidable military abilities was fascinating. The chariot was then supplanted by the warhorse / pony, and there follows a history of the various horse people's who harassed civilisation, still from below the military horizon (the Huns, the Turks and the Mongols). All their successes eventually declined due to an unwillingness to modify their nomadic way of life (the exceptions were seen where such cultural change was embraced, e.g. the Mughals in India). The main effect of these peoples on Western warfare, and thus their eventual influence on Clausewitz, was their embracing of a ruthless approach to war and an obsession with unconditional victory. It is also interesting to note that their approach to war really represents an alternative military tradition, where the warrior life was a culture in itself, and that this tradition troubled the world for an exceedingly long time until the coming of gunpowder. Keegan then goes on to look in more detail at the military tradition that is familiar to Clausewitz; the professional, disciplined army raised by a bureaucratic state.Keegan's conclusion is that there are only a limited number of forms that military organisation has taken, that there is an intimate relationship between the form and the social and political order to which it belongs, but that this can all be exceedingly complex and must be taken on a case by case basis. The forms themselves are warrior, mercenary, slave, regular, conscript and militia.The concurrent development that allowed warfare to increase its scope and intensity was the discovery of iron. So called Western warfare, characterised by closing with the enemy for a decisive result, then began to emerge in ancient warfare, initially in Greece. Greek warfare, defined by the city state militia infantry and the tactics of the phalanx, as well as the particular topographical conditions in Greece, is explored in fascinating detail, and appears to have been a particularly intense and brutal way to fight. Greek naval warfare, and the culmination of phalanx water in Macedon and Alexander's conquests in Asia, are also examined in detail. Alexander struck at a propitious moment, when Achaemenid Persia was over extended and vulnerable, and the central Asian societies were not as strong as they would be 1000 years later, after the rise of Islam. Militarily, he employed a combination of the phalanx and armoured cavalry in a potent strategy that allowed him to carve out an enormous empire over 12 years campaigning. Keegan then moves on to look at Rome, who took Greek tactics and developed, regularised and professionalised them to create a war machine that was unprecedented and utterly ruthless, and which forms the pattern for modern armies. The sections on the nature of Roman imperialism, the development and difficulties of the Roman army, and the effects of moving from republican to imperial government on Roman warfare, are all very engaging. It was particularly interesting that the Roman centurionate formed the first body of professional fighting officers known to history. It was also interesting to compare Greece and Rome, in Keegan's words \"Rome, unlike classical Greece, was a civilisation of law and of physical achievement, not of speculative ideas and artistic creativity. The imposition of its laws and the relentless extension of its extraordinary physical infrastructure demanded not so much intellectual effort as unstinted energy and moral discipline. It was of these qualities that the army was the ultimate source.\"Following the collapse of the Western Roman empire, armies ceased to exist in Europe. Ultimately, some level of order was restored by the development of feudalism, but professional armies were not to return in the Roman pattern until the 16th century, after the development of gunpowder allowed central government to rexert control over local lords. A technological development that was significant to the European middle ages was the stirrup, allowing the development of classical knightly heavy cavalry. The new feudal order was soon put to the test, as Europe was attacked from the Islamic lands (Saracens), the steppe (Magyars) and from Scandinavia (Vikings). Europe's Christianity provided the cultural force necessary to stand against these various intrusions, and this found ultimate expression in the Crusades. From the point of view of military history, the crusades provide the most accurate picture we possess of the culture and nature of European warfare in the period between the fall of the western Roman empire and the reemergence of state forces in the 16th century. The main feature of this was the charge by heavy cavalry, which ultimately failed in the crusades as the crusaders opponents had a completely different military tradition that didn't accept the premises of western European warfare; they used the swarming tactics of the lightly armoured steppe warrior to great effect. This seems to me a great illustration of the maxim that warfare is an expression of culture. It is also interesting to see in the military religious orders the origins of the regimented armies that reemerged in Europe a few hundred years later, as the warrior impulse began once again to be contained within some sort of ethical and moral framework. It is also interesting that the ideal of the heavy cavalry charge was seen to be self defeating in Europe, and knights increasingly fought their battles dismounted, in a way not completely dissimilar to phalanx warfare, and certainly as intense and brutal. Ultimately, this whole way of waging war was brought to an end by the introduction of gunpowder.Before looking at gunpowder, Keegan spends some time examining the practicalities of logistics and supply, and their effect on warfare, in a really interesting and engaging chapter that only serves to underline the complexity of war and of any attempt to understand and analyse it in a complete way.The introduction of gunpowder brought the age of the castle to an end, and allowed kings to reassert their authority. It subsequently ushered in a revolution in fortification, giving defensive works a pattern they were to retain for several hundred years. There also followed a revolution in battlefield tactics, as firearms increasingly came to dominate, and brought to an end the emphasis on individualised combat between men with edged weapons that had held sway since the days of Charlemagne. So, there was significant resistance to the gunpowder revolution from the mounted aristocrats who formed the core of Europe's warrior class.Gunpowder was much more readily adopted at sea, initially on rowed galley's. The Ottoman Turks utilised this innovation to aid them in their 15th and 16th century conquest of an empire that encompassed almost all the territory once ruled from Byzantium. This Mediterranean galley warfare was essentially the same amphibious undertaking that it had been 2000 years before. Outside the Mediterranean, true naval warfare was also entering the gunpowder age. It was particularly interesting to note how the combination of the long range ocean going warship, gunpowder, and a completely different and more ruthless approach to waging war (as pioneered in Greece and Rome) allowed the European nations to carve out such vast empires from the 16th century on. As they increasingly clashed with each other at sea, the parallels with the earlier warrior culture of the European pikeman and the Greek phalanx were striking, as naval warfare was a short range, intense and brutal experience. On land, the late 17th century developments of the ring bayonet (making pikemen obsolete) and universalised infantry drill gave land battles the character they were to retain for the next 200 years. Armies were simultaneously brought under a much more uniform and rigid discipline, not completely dissimilar to the military slavedom of the Mamelukes and janissaries, as discipline was harsh, most civil rights were denied, and individuality was surrendered. The chaotic experimentalism of the 16th and 17th centuries settled down in the 18th thanks to this combination of drill, discipline, mechanical tactics and scientific gunnery, and wasn't to significantly change for 150 years. These developments also introduced an indecisiveness to warfare, as wars were increasingly decided by the exhaustion of reserves of money or men rather then by a decisive clash of arms. Paradoxically, these same developments proved decisive when fighting opponents in the irregular steppe tradition that had so frustrated the Crusaders, as seen in the wars between Hapsburg Austria and the Ottomens, and between Britain and the Moghuls in India. The revolutionary armies in France and America then introduced the idea of the citizen soldier, giving rise to Clausewitz's belief that warfare is ultimately a political act. His theorising on the desirability of total war led to the establishment of general conscription throughout Europe, leading to the large armies and reserves, and general militarisation that culminated in the first world war. This was not finally due to Clausewitz himself, but rather a reflection of a cultural mood that accepted the right of the state to demand military service from any able bodied man, and that saw a civic virtue in such service; the nationalism that prevailed in Europe in the late 19th century was distinctly militarist. All of this was shattered by the unprecedented destruction of the first world war, as the universalisation of warrior values, a distinctly western military culture, and technological innovation combined to inflict enormous casualties on the combatant armies. This trajectory continued into the second world war, and culminated in the invention and application of nuclear weapons. This shows the ultimate hollowness and horror of Clausewitzian theory; if followed to its logical conclusion, we would destroy ourselves utterly.In conclusion, Western military culture had proved irresistible when directed against other military cultures; when directed against itself it brought disaster and threatened catastrophe. To be truly effective in defending civilisation, the western warrior must relearn the lessons of ritual and restraint from alternative military cultures, and so Keegan ends this masterful work. I found this to be a really thoughtful, instructive and convincing history and anthropology of warfare, and is worth reading by anyone with an interest in military history and human nature."}], "description": "The acclaimed author of The Face of Battle examines centures of conflict in a variety of diverse societies and cultures. \"Keegan is at once the most readable and the most original of living military historians . . .
