I found the premise of the story really good\u2026..a woman who regains her sight after being blind for twenty years and uses her talents to help people with problems by doing music therapy and she also helps the FBI solve cases. Kendra Michaels is reluctant to help the FBI again after some not so good interactions with them in the past.When her ex boyfriend and FBI agent, goes missing and her ex lover FBI agent, Adam Lynch asks for her help, she agrees. But not without giving the FBI agents a hard time. The agents are portrayed as totally stupid and ineffective and only KENDRA MICHAELS is the smart one!The bad guys are so idiotic that I could have solved the case myself.The romance between Adam and Kendra..sorry, did I say romance??? No, there\u2019s not even a flicker of heat between these two!!Their interaction became so damn tiresome after a while.I didn\u2019t exactly hate this book\u2026..just didn\u2019t do it for me!!! Maybe book #2 will be better!!!"}, {"userName": "Kirsten ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten", "userReview": "An excellent debut for a new suspense series. I really liked the two leads. However, it felt like they were being set up as a couple -- they had great chemistry -- but the romance never seemed to happen.

It was published post-\"Bonnie,\" so maybe Johansen just needed a fresh start. Unfortunately, it looks like this is the beginning of a series, and it seems that Johansen's series tend to go downhill if they last too long. Kendra Michaels--I think that's her name, although some pages, including this one, say \"Michael\"--is a woman who spent the first 20 years of her life blind. She's learned to navigate the world around her through sound, smell, and touch, which is fine, except she's an Iris Johansen heroine, so her talents have to be absurdly superhuman. Of course the FBI is just peeing their pants for a chance to use her in their investigations.She has recently had her eyesight restored, which only serves to make her even more amazing. Sigh...So what did I like about this book? First of all, new characters. And for once, the heroine's stubbornness made sense. If you were used to people treating you differently because you had a disability, wouldn't you want people to stop acting like you had to be protected all the time? I also don't remember Kendra being nearly as difficult to relate to as Johansen's other heroines.Part of my enjoyment of \"Close Your Eyes\" was probably also due to Adam Kyle, the love interest. He wasn't nearly as crabby and violent as the other love interests in Johanen's books, so I found him to be refreshing. That doesn't mean he was completely devoid of stalker-like behavior, but he was a lot more jovial, and the fact that I can only remember one creepy thing he does--sending something to Kendra's phone when he shouldn't even know her phone number--means that I wasn't flying into a rage every five minutes.I didn't only find Kendra likable. I also liked her friend, whose name escapes me. Most friends of Johansen's heroines are either so obnoxious I hate them almost immediately, or they're so dull and cliche that I find it difficult to care what happens to them. I did find it hard to believe that her friend, who was also blind, didn't harbor any jealousy of Kendra's restored vision, but maybe I'm just a selfish, bitter husk of a human being.I will say I was able to predict a \"twist\" to the story, but that didn't bother me. Some people prefer to read books where it's impossible to figure out what happens next. That's always fun, but I also feel vindicated when I'm able to solve a mystery. It's important to strike a balance.It's unfortunate that I remember so little of this book, which means it's \"average\" rather than \"above average\" or \"good.\" At the same time, it's not what I'd call \"below average,\" which is how I feel about most of Johansen's books (although I've read authors who were far worse). It's not even that I read this book too long ago; I read \"And Then You Die,\" \"Blood Game,\" \"Body of Lies,\" and \"Chasing the Night\" before this one, yet I remember far more about them.I really think it's just that I have little to say as far as ranting about how bad \"Close Your Eyes\" was. So that's a good thing, I guess.Like most Iris Johansen books, \"Close Your Eyes\" has moments of violence. Johansen doesn't spare any details when characters are killed by a shot to the head. There's a particularly gruesome scene where a couple of drug...brewers? Mixers? Anyway, they're killed, and I don't remember the details, but it was pretty graphic. Take care.I can't even remember if there's any sex in this story, but there is chemistry between Kendra and Adam.I do remember enjoying this book, and I'd put it on the higher end of 3-star reads."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6217162-donna", "userReview": "This book had a very interesting premise. Music therapist Kendra Michaels spent the first part of her life in darkness, being blind from birth. She perfected her other senses, and so when she gained her sight through stem cell surgery years later, she had cultivated powers of observation that exceeded the average person's. She became an invaluable tool for the FBI, but felt used by them and overwrought during a case gone bad. But now, she is back in the center of it all when her ex-lover, an FBI member, goes missing. Former agent Adam Lynch needs her help locating him and closing the investigation which led to his disappearance.Sounds pretty good so far, if only the rest of the story had lived up to the beginning and the writing had been better. I have read a few books by these authors before, a mother and son team, and I keep forgetting how they commit some rather unforgivable crimes where writing is concerned: 1) Exclamatory sentences abound: The door opened! Run! Hide! Oh No! 2) Sound effects spelled out: Holy moly! Ka pow! Ka ching! Whammo! 3) The characters tell themselves what to do: Keep moving, Kendra. Ignore him. Don't let him get to you. Now, as for the characters, they could have been interesting. There was a little chemistry going between Adam and Kendra, though no romance, if you are looking for one here. But they had no dimension to them, and I did not like them. They were lifeless and all business. Kendra was fairly cold, and oftentimes, she was in bitch mode, except toward her blind friend, Olivia. Adam was a robot for the most part, conducting an investigation that was slow going, though it interested me enough that I kept reading the book. It seems like this might be the first book in a series. If so, I hope that the characters come alive in the next books as we learn more about them. The question is, will I get up the nerve to read the next book?"}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13487611-lee", "userReview": "Kendra Michaels has an incredible ability and assists the FBI with her unique way of observing and analysing information.

Following surgery to restore her sight, Kendra put her incredible powers of observation to good use by aiding the FBI until a life altering case put her on a different path. Now a series of multiple murders has sent former FBI agent and current Justice Department fixer, Adam Lynch, to Kendra's door. Despite her reluctance, she feels compelled to assist him, but this decision might very well have devastating consequences for those she loves. An enjoyable read overall, but the lack of romance is disappointing, especially as the book is marketed as romantic suspense when it is, in fact, more of a police procedural/thriller. Although Kendra is a somewhat prickly heroine who may rub some readers the wrong way, her Sherlockian abilities are very intriguing and are portrayed realistically. Lynch has his own anti-social issues to deal with, but he is likeable nonetheless. Unfortunately, Kendra and Lynch had absolutely no chemistry and the romance is virtually non-existent. The case is very intriguing with some truly diabolical villains whose POVs ratchet up the tension. That said, the first half of the book with the bodies piling up and the forensics investigation is better than the second half, which seems to lose momentum as Lynch and Kendra close in on the perpetrators. Also, the FBI mole is glaringly obvious from relatively early on. In sum, the mystery is better than the romance and it is unlikely that I will continue with the series as I am not invested in the characters."}, {"userName": "Ornella (Nyx)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6282007-ornella-nyx", "userReview": "3.5 StarsI am not quite sure how to rate this. Plot wise, it was pretty damn amazing. Actually if the rating was solely on the plot, it would be a solid 5 stars. But where it lacked was in the characters, especially Kendra. To me Kendra seemed incredibly cold, analytically, as if she didn't have feelings. Which is weird cause she is very sensitive and seems to take things to heart. But I didn't feel it. I was just being told about her feelings. She wasn't quite a robot, it wasn't that bad, but it left a lot to be desired. I did however appreciate the roles and dynamics played by both Lynch and Kendra. And all the supporting characters seemed more real to me than Kendra or Lynch.But even with the character flaw I still thoroughly enjoyed this thriller."}, {"userName": "Shiela", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1442342-shiela", "userReview": "As many reviewers have already stated, Johansen is purely writing from her well-worn formula and it's getting old! \"Strong\" female characters that don't sound or act like any strong female I know, token dreamy males wanting to protect and save the day but delayed by obtuse female, uber bad guys that you don't really care about after awhile.

When former FBI agent Adam Lynch (the Puppetmaster) appears at Kendra Michaels' door she wants nothing to do with solving another crime until he reveals details about the case and her ex-lover\u2019s disappearance. Partnered, they begin searching for Jeff unraveling clues to the deaths of murdered victims that continue to increase and uncovering a mysterious substance in the bodies that induces premature aging of their organs. What begins as a missing person and murder investigation quickly escalates when they find a connection to a bankrupt corporation and a military surgeon.Having been manipulated by her capable and duty-oriented ex-boyfriend FBI agent Jeff Stedler into using her powers of observation and analysis to bring killers to justice, Kendra Michaels after the heartbreak of a tragic case wants nothing more than serenity in her life, working with autistic children as a music therapist. Blind until age twenty when stem cell surgery brought her a miracle, Kendra\u2019s acute awareness of her surroundings has given her a unique gift that is coveted by the FBI, although her bluntness and honesty has bruised FBI egos making her a pariah to the agency until Adam Lynch persuades her to help him find Jeff.Tension percolates as the body count climbs; the media breaks news of the crimes; and Kendra is targeted by a killer. Well-written and intriguing as Kendra and Lynch not only draw closer to solving the puzzle of Jeff\u2019s disappearance and the murders, but the intensity and suspense heat up as emotions rise when Kendra\u2019s world is turned upside down and her friend Olivia lies broken in the hospital after being mistaken for her. Yet amid all the scheming and violence as clues to a multi- million dollar conspiracy are uncovered and Kendra and Lynch swap witty banter in their willful clashes, they grow closer as their respect and admiration for each other grows.Enhancing the plot are rich, complex and unforgettable characters like the strong, confident and feisty Kendra Michaels whose bluntness masks a soft heart and generous spirit; the complicated, manipulative, cynical and bold Adam Lynch who doesn\u2019t play by the rules; the blind Olivia a loyal, trustworthy friend who struggles to be normal; the charismatic, stubborn, and brilliant Dr. Deanna Michaels; and Special Agent in Charge Michael Griffin with his sarcasm, lack of humor and need to control.I thoroughly enjoyed \u201c Close Your Eyes\u201d and recommend it to anyone who loves a good murder mystery with a startling twist at the end."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73069853-kate", "userReview": "I\u2019m going to start by saying that I am very glad I read these out of order because had I read Close Your Eyes first, I probably would have stopped here and not given the rest of the series a chance.As I already said I read these out of order, so I was introduced to Kendra and Lynch after their relationship had some time to grow. The one thing I did like about Close Your Eyes was seeing how the relationship between Kendra and Lynch formed. I feel like I am able to better understand Lynch\u2019s feelings for Kendra after seeing how quickly they connected and how deeply they care for one another after such a short period of tim. I also enjoyed reading about the relationship between Kendra and Olivia and their past and learning how their friendship formed and how deep and far back their relationship goes. Unfortunately, aside from learning the back story about the relationships between the main characters, I really can\u2019t say there was too much else about the book that I enjoyed. I felt that this was a little bit sci-fi ish and I also felt that the writing up until the very end was all over the place. It was hard to follow at times because there were so many characters being introduced out of nowhere. I also felt the characters and victims didn\u2019t have much connection with one another which I didn\u2019t particularly like. Overall, I was disappointed but I also understand this was the first in a series of 6 and I can say the writing and plot in the fifth novel is much more intense and well written.

I have to say , I have also tried to read the other books that she has co-written with her husband e.g Storm Cycle and they just haven't grabbed my attention so when I saw Close Your Eyes , I was in two minds. Would I enjoy it or wouldn't I ? , Readers of The Phantom Paragrapher, I loved Close Your Eyes and would put it with one of the best Mystery/Thriller books so far I have read for 2012. Close Your Eyes starts off with a random person by the name of Stephanie being killed in an underground car-park and then moves to the offices of Dr. Kendra Michaels who is a Music Therapist. We read as Kendra works with an autistic boy , this part I felt familiar with as those who have read my previous reviews know that I have family members with Autism. The appointment is ended when an FBI Agent named Adam Lynch turns up asking for Kendra's help on a case. It seems that Kendra had previously worked as a consultant for the FBI and as the novel goes along we learn that due to Kendra's past , she is one of the most observant human beings there are. When she reluctantly agrees to help on the case as more people die, Kendra's mother and friend Olivia start to get worried. Though when the case leaves Kendra's friend Olivia hanging for her life, has she bitten off more than she can chew. Close Your Eyes is one of those books where it is really hard to describe but all you need to know is this was one of the best mystery/thriller novels by Iris and Roy Johansen.Though I am curious if there has been a previous novel by the pair that featured an Introduction to Kendra Michaels as reading the book it seemed possible."}, {"userName": "Tom Tischler", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5357814-tom-tischler", "userReview": "The FBI usually does'nt bother with music therapists but Kendra Michaelsamazing powers of observation have made her a favorite of law enforcement.

Having read the background and past on the male lead I would classify him as a man of few words but he seems to be one who uses corny and cliche one-liners. The female lead was initially interesting, but once I started reading more about her, I agree with the impressions of all the FBI agents...she's a bitch.

I wanted to know how the authors would portray her. At first, I really enjoyed her blunt attitude and her amazing talent; it almost reminded me of a mix between Bones and The Mentalist. But pretty soon I got bored of Kendra. She just ... didn't have much of a personality. She was cold and hard to connect to, and there were times when she was unnecessarily harsh to those around her. Her sudden outbursts of emotion were startling because it seemed so out of place based on the way she had been acting previously. She also kept harping on the same point over and over again, and that became tiresome really quickly. Adam Lynch was also a character that I was intrigued by, but he too disappointed me in the end. He had no personality. I don't even know how to describe him because he was so bland. He just smiled all the time and drove Kendra around. While I liked seeing Kendra as the star of the show, her cold personality combined with his bland one did nothing for the story. They had absolutely no chemistry and so there was really no romance at all to see. I liked the initial plot, which was fast-paced and interesting. However, I began to feel bored at about the midway point and had to push myself through the story. There were so many things happening and the connections weren't made tight enough for my liking, and that made me less focused. The twist at the end wasn't anything too special, and in the end I felt like this novel was just like any other midlevel detective story. I had really high expectations for this series as well as these authors but unfortunately, I was disappointed. If you are looking for a fast-paced, easy detective novel, then give this one a go. But if you like something more deep, then don't bother with this series.For more reviews, visit: www.veereading.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Mainely Stories", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8329738-mainely-stories", "userReview": "Suspense and surprises with a hint of sexual tension. The main character of this book is Kendra Michaels, a strong second is the male lead but certainly, this is Kendra\u2019s story. She is the one we come to know the most about and with whom we connect. She is devoted to her students, her music therapy students, yet there is still something else in her nature that has, perhaps, become suppressed. She was formerly in a relationship and perhaps an investigational partnership with an FBI agent and is doing her best to focus on music therapy. Guilt, perhaps misplaced, along with a strong sense of responsibility tell us much about her nature. She is a strong woman who feels an obligation to not only take care of herself, independently but also a duty to those she cares about. This is the setup for this suspense-filled story with a slight edge of sexual tension, unfulfilled, between the main characters. The story is strong and the action moves along for the most part. The flashback chapter was a bit redundant for me as a reader. I am more a reader than a listener because as a reader it is easy to skim when writing becomes redundant. I did, in this case, appreciate the narration as demonstrated by the fact that I didn't move to the written delivery.An excellent performance by the narrator easily kept the reader engaged with the story."}, {"userName": "Suzie Weber", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36041068-suzie-weber", "userReview": "I am a huge Iris Johansen fan. I heard that Kendra Michaels' from this series was making an appearance in an Eve Duncan book I wanted to be up to speed. This book and series is written by Iris Johansen and her son Roy Johansen. They have been writing books together for years. As I started this book I felt I missed a book along the way. There was so much back detail, I discovered there is a novella so I'm going to read that next. Kendra is an interesting character, I'm not even sure if I like her. She is bossy and bitchy and a know-it-all. She defines: it's my way or the highway. Yet, her assertiveness keeps the book moving along. It seems that when she dated Jeff, an FBI agent, she helped out on a case. Most of the FBI team isn't real crazy about her personally or helping again on another case. Jeff goes missing and another agent, Lynch from a different branch of the government enlists Kendra's help. I got the feeling that she is in her late twenties early thirties and he's in his fifties yet a possible romance brewing??No matter I am intrigued; which means I am reading book two in this series. Four stars is generous I'm hoping book two cements that four or a five."}], "description": "A music therapist who thrives on helping others, Kendra Michaels cherishes the ordinary life she has achieved after stem cell surgery restored her sight.
