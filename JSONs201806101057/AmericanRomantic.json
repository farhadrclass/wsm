I'm not that easily won over-I have an unfair aversion to white, male writers, especially those who appear to be affluent members of New England society. (The last is purely my prejudice; other than knowing he lives in Massachusetts, I have no knowledge of Mr. Just's background). He's not especially edgy. Although overtly political, his writing is hardly subversive. It's political primarily in that he often writes of that world. In this book, the lead character, Harry Sanders, is a diplomat. At the opening of the book, he is assigned to what was French Indochine, soon to become Vietnam, America's first lost war. Harry's world is that of gentle Connecticut villages, Sunday lunches with friends of his family around a table too big for his home, a table that brings the world to Harry and which, in turn, entices him to go out into it, abandoning his small world for the larger one in which America becomes a major player.Harry is a romantic-pursuing the dignified calling of diplomacy in a world where the ugly truth is power and its brutality. During his time in Vietnam, Harry is forced to confront himself as part of that power. He is both drawn to it and wary of it. He is not a man of direct truths but of subtle gestures (unless of course the pretenses have to be dropped for some reason; then he shows himself as the power he represents).Into the jungle of southeast Asia and Harry's career comes Sieglinde-a woman from as different a world than Harry's as can be imagined. A child of the German war, abandoned, orphaned, on the run from life, Sieglinde falls into Harry's life and the two of them, old devastated Europe, young rising America haunt each other's lives after a brief affair.The symbolism, if I'm not imagining it, is not heavy-handed. Nothing Just does is obvious or clumsy. He is the most graceful writer I can imagine. Just's writing is pure pleasure, rhythmic, balanced, with the beauty of poetry. Reading Just is one of my favorite things to do in the world. Where most of the writers I love are positioned outside the structures of power, critiquing, responding, Just is writing from within. Critiquing, responding, gently, with wit and intelligence and lovely, lovely prose. I loved his book as I have loved the others I have read so far (An Unfinished Season, The Weather in Berlin, Forgetfulness, The Translator). His people are real but also, more than that. They are dreams of desire, wanting more than exists, seemingly grounded but also gestures of yearning. Have I said I love Ward Just? And, just to be clear, let me say I loved American Romantic. It's a wonderful novel, deceptively realistic, totally accessible but, like the world he portrays, in the final analysis, elusive and resistant to grasp."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "First, a big thank you to Goodreads FirstReads and to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for enabling me to be one of the early readers of this powerful new novel.Ward Just has been writing books for over 40 years now and they just keep getting better and better. There\u2019s a ring of authenticity to his books and insights that, for me, call to mind Graham Greene. For me, American Romantic ranks among his very finest.Foreign services officer Harry Sanders is at the beginning of his career, yet realizes that his \u201cfate was to witness events I didn\u2019t understand and would never understand.\u201d He is the American Romantic personified, clear-eyed enough to recognize the shifting reality of his role and yet pursuing it anyway. Early on, he is tapped for a potentially dangerous and sensitive mission, to meet with the enemies who may or may not be ready to begin a dialogue. The ensuing events could only be written by an author who is in-the-know and can carefully craft the intricacies of a diplomatic mission and its nuances.We see Harry not only though his own eyes, but through those of his lover, a young German woman, Sieglinde, who is far more advanced in knowing what the world is all about. About Americans, Sieglinde says, \u201cThey take pride in their makeovers, a nation of actors, or should I say playwrights, each examining her own story. That\u2019s the myth, anyhow. A nation in an eternal state of rewrite.\u201d Although she views Harry as \u201ca lovely man\u201d, she knows instinctively that he is limited: \u201cHe was not as interested in his history as I was in mine.\u201d Put another way, Harry is incapable of a certain perceptiveness. When Sieglinde tells a fellow German that Americans are romantic, he counters, \u201cI would not say romantic. I would say optimistic. Yet it is true that optimism is a precondition of the American temperment.\u201dIn the second half of the book, set in the present, Harry has taken his place in the diplomatic community as an ambassador. He has married an attractive woman from Vermont named May (the only character who did not ring quite true to me) and has begun to recognize what he cannot recognize: \u201cAmerican was a parallax universe, powerful, hypnotic in its own way, quarrelsome and petulant, and irrelevant to him. His birth country had become thing of curiosity; the farther away from it, the more dangerous it seemed. A matter of optics.\u201dAmerican Romantic is, at the same time, accessible and dense, with disquieting and acute observations of how our romanticism and optimism doom us to repeat scenarios \u2013 from Vietnam to Afghanistan. It\u2019s a brilliantly written book and a strong indication that Ward Just \u2013 who is close to 80 years old \u2013 is far from slowing down."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce", "userReview": "The hero of Ward Just\u2019s novel is Harry Sanders, a young junior diplomatic officer in Viet Nam just before the escalation of US involvement in the war there. Two events occur early in the story that shadow Harry throughout the rest of his career. One is his very brief affair with Sieglinde, a young German woman working on a German hospital ship, herself an orphan perpetually fleeing from Germany and her memories there. The second is a clandestine assignment in which Harry is sent into the jungle to meet with a communist representative to discuss a possible rapprochement, a meeting that itself comes to nothing politically but that results in Harry\u2019s killing a young combatant. This event determines that he will never rise to a prominent diplomatic position in the service.Harry moves for decades from minor post to minor post. He marries May, herself leaving an impoverished family in northern New England, and they have a satisfactory if not exciting marriage until her death much later, a death that may have been a suicide. Harry himself ultimate retires to a secluded coastal home in southern France.I enjoyed reading this novel but am surprised to find that only two days later much of it is slipping from my memory. Just\u2019s writing is impressionistic, suggesting more than it states, as if it all exists in a faint kind of haze. The writing itself is pleasing but not obviously, at least for me, memorable, and so much of Harry\u2019s life itself seems characterized by a kind of drifting that I as a reader ended up feeling that I was rather drifting, too. I liked the insights into the functioning and mindset of diplomats, many of whom seemed to be somewhat rootless and lost souls living in a collective world of their own. Will this work stick with me longer than it seems to be doing so far? I wonder if this novel is typical of Ward Just\u2019s writing. I may dip into another of his works."}, {"userName": "Manray9", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7288965-manray9", "userReview": "American Romantic is not among Just's best work, but I was impressed with:He was eager to read the newspaper's accounts of the presidential campaign, now in full October flower. A black man running for the presidency! Harry had lived outside the country for so long he could not fathom how such a thing could happen, yet here he was, a graduate of both Columbia University and Harvard Law, a white man's pedigree. He was a marvelous writer. The last time a writer had occupied the White House was the time of the Civil War, and what a writer he was. Teddy Roosevelt wrote, too, but not very well; and nothing at all from that time to this, except Wilson and Jimmy Carter. Some caution warranted there. Probably a writer's temperament would not fit well in the modern White House, too much time given over to the shape and music of sentences while all around him clamored for action. A writer required repose, moments of stillness wherein an angel might speak. However, angels did not always bring benevolent thoughts, and they were not always angels. Sometimes they arrived in disguise."}, {"userName": "Kasa Cotugno", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2345554-kasa-cotugno", "userReview": "We first meet Harry Sanders in Indochina in the early 60s. Young, somewhat idealistic, given the eponymous title by a lover. Harry could be a stand-in for American hubris, thinking diplomacy can make everything all right. Later, a more jaded Harry, likens his life in the diplomatic corps to Sisyphus and his rock. His wife, more pragmatic, objected to that point of view, \"arguing that nothing was more idealistic than the pursuit of a doomed objective.\" Such is the baserock of this immersive novel. A surface reading could raise similarities to Graham Greene, but I found it to resemble one of my favorite books of recent years, Jane Gardham's Old Filth, with its similarities in theme, tone, and style. Not the least of which is Harry's relationship with his wife, May, very much like the couple in Gardham's book which evolved into a trilogy. Ward Just is much more economical in his prose, and his character study requires no further exploration."}, {"userName": "Marc", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/816768-marc", "userReview": "Just is a good novelist. The plot was a good one, but it meandered a bit too much for my taste. I was also put off by his decision not to use quotes with the dialogue. Not sure I understand why he did this. I am sure it made things confusing at times. But maybe that's just me."}, {"userName": "Roger Brunyate", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate", "userReview": "\"we will not speak of it further\"I almost titled this Our Man in 'Nam. The first hundred pages or so of this urbane and intriguing novel are reminiscent of Graham Greene's The Quiet American. Harry Sanders, a junior career diplomat, is stationed in Vietnam (clearly, although never named), and is involved in an incident way beyond the normal expectations of his post and rank. There is the same acute sense of foreigners living at ease in a country on the brink of war, and of dangerous forces heaving below the surface. The same feeling for danger that comes out of nowhere, and of snap decisions on which not only lives may turn, but also entire lifetimes. But Just does not attempt Greene's almost religious moral reckoning. Harry does not emerge from the Vietnamese jungle entirely spotless, but any question of his guilt is soon brushed aside, written up by his ambassador after a short enquiry, and buried in the files. Or, in a phrase that comes up more than once in the book, \"We will not speak of it further.\"For one glorious week during his time in Vietnam, Harry enjoys the company of a lover, Sieglinde, a young German x-ray technician visiting with a medical NGO. It is she who calls Harry \"an American romantic,\" and his memory of her playing of Chopin is something that will stay with him throughout his life. But growing up in Hamburg in WW2, her experience of war is very different from Harry's patrician dilettantism. Their paths separate, but then Just devotes a long chapter to Sieglinde without reference to Harry, almost as though she were the protagonist rather than he. Suddenly we have jumped by several years, and Harry has become an ambassador in his turn, with a posting to Central Africa. Before too long, we have jumped again, and we see Harry in retirement in a corniche cottage in the South of France. There have been diplomatic concerns which Harry handles with consummate skill, though nothing to approach the incident in Vietnam. We will learn as much or more about his wife, May, as we did about Sieglinde, though she too has her secrets. But it is a subtly disconnected novel, a book of ellipses, whose interest lies less in the exquisitely managed glimpses into the later lives of its characters than in those things that are not said. \"We will not speak of it further.\"I was engaged throughout, but found it hard to decide what the book was about, if not this: unprocessed truths, and the ways they can shape a lifetime. Towards the end of the novel, there is a mystery of sorts, and Harry is given several opportunities to get to the bottom of it. He takes these only so far, then gives up; at bottom, he prefers not to know. A fellow ambassador, who understands something about his situation, asks him what he has learned in his life. \"My father's table,\" Harry replies. He is referring to the weekly dinners at his family home in Connecticut, whose regular guests included a general, a congresswoman, a couple of bankers, people like that. The conversation (like this book) was full of interesting stories and inside comments on public life. But each of the guests seemed to have some invisible line of secrecy beyond which they would not cross. \"We will not speak of it further.\"Is this enough framework for a novel? Ward Just writes beautifully and ties it up neatly at the end, though he left me questioning his focus: was this intended as a critique of the American national character as expressed in world politics,* or was is just an interesting character story? I cannot entirely answer, but I do wonder if we are seeing the beginning of a trend of what I might call \"After Happily Ever\" novels\u2014books about characters whose defining experiences come early in their lives, but who have many decades to live on afterwards? Last year, Sebastian Faulks published a collection of five stories on this principle, A Possible Life, and Richard Flanagan recently used a similar shape for his masterpiece The Narrow Road to the Deep North. It is a strangely oblique way of telling a story, but it also has a quality of truth that is quite moving, especially for older readers. When people like us look back on life, sometimes the ellipses are all we see. Often the things we do not speak about are the most revealing of all.======*A friend of mine has made a very good case for the idea that this is what the novel is all about: taking Harry's optimistic bumbling as par for all American foreign policy. I can see this working for readers who are inclined to take such a view anyway, but it would not convince many who didn't. While the book may leave this point open for inference, it doesn't demonstrate it; after his first adventure, Harry is never involved in anything politically significant again, and all the later American failures occur very much offstage. Indeed, if I thought that this was the only point of the novel, I would have given it only three stars, instead of my original five which I have now reduced to four."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3229150-peter", "userReview": "Readers who have sampled any of Ward Just\u2019s previous seventeen novels, as I have not, probably do not need my recommendation to read American Romantic. Those who are not familiar with him may want to read my review first because American Romantic is not for everyone. Our book club was divided. Some didn\u2019t get beyond the initial chapters; others didn\u2019t finish it. Expectations are such these days that some readers have little patience for works that require an investment\u2013\u2013i.e., giving an author time to develop her or his story.On that score American Romantic is not as dense or demanding as many other novels, although Just\u2019s style does take getting used to. He writes in first person without quotation marks, as if dialogue is the narrator remembering as opposed to what\u2019s taking place at that moment, and with first person, you are dependent on what the narrator reports about what he sees and thinks. There\u2019s no omniscient narrator to fill in the background, which puts the burden on the reader to look for clues and to pay attention. Just balances the story told by his protagonist, Harry Sanders, with the stories of two women\u2013\u2013Seiglinde, a German nurse with whom he has a brief romance while stationed in Indochina before it becomes Vietnam, and May, the woman he marries. It\u2019s not until you hear from the women that you truly appreciate Sanders.One of the benefits of first person writing is the reader is exposed to the narrator\u2019s inner life as well as his or her actions. In the hands of a writer of Just\u2019s capability that adds depth and more fully connects us to the characters. One of the more poignant sections of the novel is Harry\u2019s reaction to the death of his wife. I can\u2019t think of an example of finer writing about a character\u2019s personal loss. It brought tears to my eyes.American Romantic is an inciteful social commentary as well as a \u201cromance.\u201d It exposes us to life inside the American diplomatic community from the 1950s almost to the present. It is an optimistic story since Sanders\u2019 handling of himself and his duties stand up well in contrast to the standard portrayal of \u201cugly Americans.\u201d In addition to being romantics, Americans are described as optimists. American Romantic is a romantic, optimistic story. That\u2019s rare in this climate where it\u2019s easy to criticize and blame Americans for tragedies at home and abroad. It\u2019s good to know someone else feels that way."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613776-nancy", "userReview": "4.5 stars\"The bare bones of a well-told story required coherence, ironic asides and a plot as well-knit and tied together as a jigsaw puzzle and somewhere in it a detail as provocative as a cat in a tree.''That's from Ward Just's new novel American Romantic (Houghton Mifflin, digital galley), a well-told story if ever there was one, complete with such provocative details as a cat in a tree, a meeting in the jungle, a girl in a hammock, a car over a cliff. All play a part in the life of diplomat Harry Sanders, \"a connosieur of the counterfeit and inexplicable.''Just writes about diplomats and foreign affairs with the silky acuity that John le Carre writes about spies and espionage. As his ambassador mentor tells Harry, \"our business is not a straight-line affair. We deal with curves and switchbacks, the yes that means no and the no that means maybe. We are obliged to be comfortable with ambiguity.''Harry's career with the State Department is marked by his first posting to Saigon in the early 1960s when his covert negotiations with a communist leader lead to disaster. The event will follow him to more manageable postings in Africa and Europe, as will his memories of a brief affair with the beautiful, restless Sieglinde. Still, his later marriage to the younger May, eager to escape her stern Vermont roots, is mostly happy, and the two move smoothly in diplomatic circles. They are liked and respected, although Harry is never the high-flyer he might have been, and May has secrets of her own. Over time, Harry's youthful romanticism is tempered by realism, he wonders about America's place in the world and his own. Is the cottage in the south of France a retreat or a reward?

Harry is also a familiar \u2013 and almost stereotypical - Ward Just character; an articulate, intelligent American, who spends as little time as possible in the US, and to put it mildly, is emotionally detached as he meanders through life.In this novel the reader follows Harry\u2019s life and times; specifically his State Dept. foreign postings and to a much lesser degree his stints back in Washington, DC; as well as his romances including a marriage. Harry\u2019s first assignment in late \u201864/early \u201965 is in Indochina, i.e. Vietnam, where two things happen. First Harry falls head over heels in love with a young German woman.

Both of these \u201cevents\u201d \u2013 professional and personal - haunt him for the rest of his life.Unfortunately this opening of the story \u2013 the first two chapters \u2013 is the high point of the novel.

My prior view had been that he writes from \"inside the Beltway,\" has the intuition and sensibilities of a D.C. insider, and writes primarily for an audience of Eastern liberals, government types or other elitists who want to know (or think they know) what it is like on the inside. (I don't fit this description.) In other words, I was prepared not to like this book.This much better than average book was a nice surprise. It follows the personal and professional growth and development of a State Department diplomat and bureaucrat, Harry Sanders, throughout his 30+ year career. During that time, he rises from a low level diplomat in South Vietnam (probably Saigon) in the early 60's prior to our massive military involvement there, to service in more senior and responsible diplomatic assignments primarily in Africa and Europe as well as periodic postings to Foggy Bottom. With the exception of his assignments in South Vietnam (which are critical in shaping the course of his career and the description of which occupies the first half of the book), the novel focuses primarily on Harry's relationships with two women, Sieglinde, a West German woman with whom he has a brief but intense romance in South Vietnam, and May, an American from Vermont whom he later marries. The book is character-driven rather than plot-driven. A major strength of the book is the development of the three characters. They are not cardboard cutouts. They are nicely nuanced human beings. The book also does a nice job of communicating Harry's sense of longing for the lost Sieglinde. I think that Just writes for a well-traveled readership. This is because Harry and Sieglinde travel to and live in cities that I had never heard of (and I consider myself to be fairly well-traveled and knowledgeable about world geography).

The story describes the life of Harry Sanders, a young American foreign service officer in Vietnam who becomes involved in an ill-fated mission of parley with an enemy officer that nearly destroys him. Harry picks up the pieces and settles into a fairly comfortable diplomatic life from which he eventually retires. The key to the tale, however, is in what is missing, and what cannot be said. Near the end of the book, Harry converses with a French admiral and reminisces about his early life in Connecticut spent surrounded by politicians and generals. \"As they were talking there would come a moment when their voices trailed off and any attentive listener would know they were deep in their memories, pondering what they were unable - not unwilling but unable - to say aloud.\" The attentive reader of  American Romantic will also find that there is much that is left unwritten in this tale. Harry is introspective, yet there are missing pieces in his narrative - thoughts in the margins or between the lines that remain hidden even to him ... memories he stuffs into the \"burn bag\" rather than filing away in the archive. Early on he is asked if he is \"good at keeping secrets.\"Need-to-know, Harry said.Need-to-know, the ambassador replied.

But no, these summaries are the final draft of the novel.One passage struck me: Harry returns to his home town after a career in the foreign service and has lunch with his parents old friends, those who are still living. \". . .all the stories they told had something missing. . .As they were talking there would comes a moment when their voices trailed off and any attentive listener would know they were deep in their memories, pondering what they were unable - not unwilling but unable - to say aloud. The missing piece. All the stories had missing pieces that spoke to motive and perhaps misprision or something very like misprision. This was something personal and inexplicable, the fact that refused to fall in line with the other facts. A black-sheep fact, important enough to make a tidy account a little less tidy. To grasp it you had to have been there.\"Unfortunately, Harry's observation about his friends mirrors mine about Just's novel."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1848332-cathy", "userReview": "I loved this book about foreign service officer Harry Sanders and \"his war,\" a war one can assume is the Vietnam War but is only referred to as the war in Indochina. After Harry has a passionate but brief love affair with a German woman, Sieglinde, he is saddened and confused when she vanishes from his life without even a goodbye by sailing off into the night on her medical ship. Harry then follows his ambassador's orders to meet clandestinely with an enemy leader in hopes of resolving some of the issues of the war; the mission is an utter failure. Harry is left to find his way out of the jungle after the doomed meeting, and in the process he ruins his feet by forgetting to put on his shoes for the trek out of the jungle. Disoriented by the whole affair, he has a chance meeting with an evil-looking enemy combatant, and he takes an action that forever changes him, but doesn't alter the trajectory of his career. The story follows Harry through his marriage to May and his postings as ambassador in the far-flung corners of the world. He continues to reflect on the life-altering events that brought him to his destiny throughout the remainder of the story, never able to forget those few incidents that left their marks on him. I love Ward Just's style of writing and storytelling; I felt like I was living Harry's life with him, in sync. Reading the book took me back to my own dream, late in life, of becoming a foreign service officer, a dream which I was never able to realize. At least in reading this book, I was able to live the foreign service life vicariously."}, {"userName": "MisterLiberry Head", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10500708-misterliberry-head", "userReview": "As my rating shows, I didn\u2019t much like AMERICAN ROMANTIC, but I respected the skill and earnestness of the novelist. Equally experienced in the maze of the Vietnam War and the machinations of Washington, Ward Just starts AMERICAN ROMANTIC in the earliest, hazy days leading up to the escalation of that ill-conceived conflict. He never names the place in Indochina to which idealistic foreign service officer Harry Sanders has been posted. However, Just describes incomprehensibly teeming city streets surrounded by an atmosphere humid with malice and deep jungle signifying the Heart of Darkness. Harry falls in love with a German national named Sieglinde. But he marries the loyal May, who follows him through 30 years of diplomatic postings and minor ambassadorships.(BTW, dialogue without quotation marks is an affectation I find really irritating--and AMERICAN ROMANTIC doesn\u2019t get a pass on committing that transgression.)AMERICAN ROMANTIC shows how abruptly a privileged Connecticut Yankee can lose both at love and the State Department career game. In his 18th novel, Just\u2019s storytelling is controlled & worldly. He has something to say about the human cost of the duplicity required by international diplomacy and the impact of seemingly small misjudgments. See also ECHO HOUSE (1997) for more from Just about Washington power brokers and STRINGER (1974) about spooks in the Vietnam War."}, {"userName": "Billhotto", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3580681-billhotto", "userReview": "Familiar themes for Just, as always, handled gracefully. The novel covers fifty years in the life of American diplomat Harry Sanders, from a posting in 1964 Saigon to his retirement in the south of France. Harry's life is inexorbitaly changed by an ill conceived mission in Vietnam which he barely survives, to do so he has to kill a young Viet Cong soldier. He is left crippled physically and emotionally. Returning to Saigon he finds that Sieglinde, the German woman he is in love with, has left for places unknown. Later, Harry marries an American, May, who wants to escape her family's isolated Vermont farm. They follow the itinerate lives of diplomats and their spouses. Because of the lingering shadow of his Viet Nam experience, Harry is forever assigned to posts on the periphery of major events. Harry and May trudge on, trying to do good work, but realizing all too well the limits of American power. Harry is based partly on George Kennan, and like Kennan, he feels alienated from other Americans, from their optimism and provincialism, especially their belief they can effect change in societies far older than the United States. This is, in part, the result of the hubris after the Second World War, which Just compares to German resignation. After a final tragedy, Harry retires to a cottage in France where he lives alone with the ghosts of his memories. At the end, one of those ghosts returns to the stage for a final bow."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3872023-jim", "userReview": "Harry Sanders is the title character of AMERICAN ROMANTIC, a Foreign Service officer from Connecticut. As a young man he is posted to Viet Nam, before the war was a war, when the U.S. military presence was called a Military Assistance Command. The events and people he becomes involved with in Indochina continue to be important touchstones for him, as his life and career move downstream, especially his brief romance with a young German woman named Sieglinde and an ill-starred meeting with a leader of the communist guerilla force. The author provides an interesting insight when he has Harry, later in life, describe the essence of his diplomatic persona as,\u201c A connoisseur of the counterfeit and the inexplicable.\u201d (pg 175). The reader sees someone who doesn\u2019t expect to stop the world from bleeding, but who applies what pressure he can to the wounds anyway.Ward Just has written a thoughtful, slow paced and melancholy book. It seems to say that trying to change the course of the world or of your life is a dangerous thing and you may be forever damaged by the attempt. Each of the characters of this novel have more than one beginning, as a river is composed of the waters of many streams. In this tale, there is a surface and much that remains distorted beneath it. Like the story of unclear images it tells, it was difficult for me to clearly know how to rate this book. It kept me reading, but I cannot say that I always enjoyed what was written."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27346360-mike", "userReview": "As an aging romantic myself, I was a bit disappointed in this book. It starts relatively well with an early defining moment, like a small firecracker that leaves a persistent odor. The middle of the book drags a bit, but the ending chapters offer some compensation for finishing the book. As a retired traveler in much of the same world as the book describes, I found it a little thin on the substance of the life lived by those wondering the world. Certainly, foreign service officers would find many of the details difficult to accept as even remotely characteristic of the life lived abroad. Most of this book seems to be devoted to describing the origins and ends of the main characters, not all American or in any way central to the story, as perhaps an (unsuccessful) attempt to illuminate the interior of the people we meet in the book. On the more mundane level, the writing itself seemed uninspired, with repetition and description of small things bewildering (e.g. All smokers seem to blow smoke rings.) On a logical decision level, it is not clear why an aging man with a permanent problem with his feet, would retire to a nearly inaccessible hilltop house, requiring an arduous walk."}, {"userName": "Mark Noble", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28567900-mark-noble", "userReview": "I like Ward Just and his writing style, a real writer's writer, but this is the second book in a row that disappointed. The book has a great start, with Harry Sanders beginning his career in diplomacy in the jungles of SE Asia during the 60's. The second half of the book takes place after Harry is retired, his wife has died and he is thinking back on his life. It reads like a completely different book. Harry is in love with a woman in each part of the book. Sieglinde, in Asia, a very complicated German lady who will haunt him throughout his life, and May, his wife, an American from Vermont, who is Harry's partner in a series of diplomatic postings around the world. We watch them drift apart as Harry reminisces about his life. The ending was an anti-climax. Just's fans should definitely read the book, but if you have not read any of his work, I would start with The Weather in Berlin or Jack Gance."}, {"userName": "Harry", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2525806-harry", "userReview": "First book by Ward Just.....it has a flow to it but desultory in the whole. Career diplomat with patrician roots who by his own self admission has little to show for his life's work with the exception that he disarmed and killed a young (teenage) Viet Cong in the course of a seemingly nonsensical mission into the jungle during his first diplomatic posting in Saigon in the mid 60s. He meets and falls in love with a german woman in Saigon who leaves him without notice and reappears at the very end of the story. He marries a woman who does not seem suited to the many moves and minor posting inherent in a diplomat's career who is killed in a mysterious auto accident during the diplomats last posting in the Balkans. A forensic examination of the accident scene along with his discovery of his wife's diaries hints at some undisclosed secret(s) for which he has little interest or curiosity in pursuing (he pitches the diaries, letters in the embassy burn bag)."}, {"userName": "Jjudyfl", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5135623-jjudyfl", "userReview": "I won this book from Goodreads. This book is haunting, romantic, and I have been trying to fairly describe it for others, but that has proven difficult. Yes, there was a story here, but it was like a long, sad, memoir. Harry Sanders is a pensive man, with more passion than healthy(?) for a woman he met years ago while stationed overseas. After a couple of demanding and almost deadly assignments, he finds himself in the role of diplomat. He married the more appropriate May, who just isn't as compelling as his recurring thoughts of Sieglinde.  His past is forever stuck in his brain. His mind and his body still limp. The life of a diplomat, it seems, is never quite settled or comfortable. Reading American Romantic made me uncomfortable.

I did not learn about his newest novel until I found it on the New Releases shelf in the library. I usually can find my favorite authors\u2019 books through B&N, Amazon or the New York Review of Books. For some reason, American Romantic did not make any of those lists. The book concerns the State Department career of Harry Sanders. His career begins in Vietnam where he is sent on a mission that has disastrous results. Harry returns from the mission with crippled feet. The book ends at the end of Harry\u2019s career in the south of France where he retires. A central theme of the book is Harry\u2019s ardent affair with Sieglinde, a German X-ray technician on a hospital ship anchored in Saigon and his subsequent marriage to a woman from Vermont.

Then it just plateaus and flattens out.I had difficulty following dialogue. Conversations are simply sentences stacked on top of each other with no reference as to who said what. As I read, I would have to stop, then go back to the beginning of the dialogue and make note of who was saying what. Awfully annoying.Did the author have to stick a Nazi reference in when writing about the main character in Germany? Nazi shock value? If a Nazi doesn't have some specific reason for being in the story, why even mention them? There's more going on in Germany beside a Hitleresque Nazi dotted past.The writing is very matter of fact. At times, it felt more like reading a report. Perhaps that was why I found the book lack luster and not up to Ward Just's other novels."}], "description": "Harry Sanders is a young foreign service officer in 1960s Indochina when a dangerous and clandestine meeting with insurgents\u2014ending in quiet disaster\u2014and a brief but passionate encounter with Sieglinde, a young German woman, alter the course of his life.Absorbing the impact of his misstep, Harry returns briefly to Washington before eventual assignments in Africa, Scandinavia, and the Mediterranean.
