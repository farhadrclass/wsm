During the day, she's known as the Le Voleur D\u2019or, the golden thief. And at night, she's subjugated to that of a servant to an evil, malevolent oppressor. Kane watched from afar as the golden haired beauty lured her victims to complacency until they find themselves stripped off their riches. When an opportunity afforded him the chance to uncover the real Marguerite, Kane was surprised with how familiar she was with his secret life. Though his kind is something she has no knowledge of, there are certainly other creatures This is my intro to Lisa Kessler's literary world. Historical Paranormal Romance is quite a novelty in my shelves so I wasn't at all expecting the surprise I got in this novella. What I got was a story that gave everything it had promised without giving me an impression that I'd missed something. Romance, suspense and a glimpse at an opulent world darkened by the creatures that stalked their preys at night. Her immortal characters are derivative of vampires whose appetites tend to favour those who didn't deserve to live. And while they audaciously consider themselves judge, jury and executioner, I'm all for vigilante justice. The romance was as good and surprisingly not lacking in steam for a book so slight. The characters' mutual attractions were as natural as Lisa's writing. I'm more inclined to check out the rest of the series after reading this little bitty. I just know that there's a lot more in store with interesting characters that I'm dying to get to know. Night Thief was the perfect introduction to this series. It will whet your appetite just so that you would crave the subsequent books before you even finish this one. I, for one, have just become a follower."}, {"userName": "Melissa Cutler", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7225477-melissa-cutler", "userReview": "Lisa Kessler has done it again with an amazing addition to her NIGHT series.

Marguerite Rousseau is willing to lie, steal and cheat to get the money she needs to escape her sadistic master to the New World with her young cousin and as Le Voleur D\u2019or, she gets away with it. Until one mysterious nobleman isn't fooled by her seductive act. Kane Bordeaux has been around centuries, living in France since the genocide of his people. As a Night Walker, Kane protects humans by night and feeds on the blood of the depraved but never truly lives until he witnesses a woman lifting the purse off a gentleman. Intrigued by the Golden Thief, he lures her nearer by tempting her with his pocket watch. But one night in his company leads to severe punishment from her master and Kane is determined to keep her safe but Marguerite doesn't hand out her trust easily. Vampire or Night Walker? Savior or monster? Who is the elegant stranger who claims to want only to protect her and ignites a burning passion inside of her?Packed full of suspense; Night Thief was one huge story in small packaging. I was actually worried towards the end there that there wouldn't be a HEA for these characters! A prequel to the Night series, despite the #1.5, Night Thief entrances readers with Kane, one of the first Night Walkers and a God among his people. Sadly though, thanks to an un-stoppable demon, Kane had to leave his brothers and leads a pretty solitary existence now in France. I loved how despite societies strictures he never fully conformed to what those in his class would consider fashionable or even acceptable. He lived his life how he saw fit , not others. Even when Marguerite thought him to be a monster, he stayed true to himself. The chemistry between Kane and Marguerite was palpable and I was rooting for them from the beginning. Marguerite was such a strong and determined character as well, I really enjoyed reading about her and Kane. A wonderful read from author Lisa Kessler and I look forward to more from this fantastic paranormal romance series!"}, {"userName": "Mirandia Berthold", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17189670-mirandia-berthold", "userReview": "I finished this book rather quickly, as it is a quick read. With the first chapter I was really unsure of how I was going to feel about this book, yet I kept reading, as I was still intrigued. The synopsis of the book is really what grabbed my attention in the first place and knew I would have to give it more than a chapter to get to the good stuff.I will have to say that I now think that I am a new fan of Lisa Kessler, and I am so ready to read the other stories that are a part of the Night Series. I love that she is not repetitive with descriptions as some romance writers can be. I loved the character development and growth that you saw with Rita, and of course who would not love Kane! The idea of shape-shifting,and immortality both really appealed to me as well. My brain was in overload, but in a good way. I kept chanting to myself. \"vampires, gods, and a thief. Oh my!\". I have also become someone who loves nothing more than to be able to dive into the world, based and the description. With the mention of actual places in Paris, slight French here and there, and just the overall descriptions given I truly felt immersed in this book and the world that was in it! I am giving this book 4 stars instead of five for two main reasons:1. While I knew it was a novella from the beginning I wished for more.2. I for some reason did, as I mentioned, have a bit of trouble getting into in during the first bit.I cannot wait to start on the first actual book in the Night Series and hope that it grabs me the way that this wonderfully written novella did!! *In full complete disclosure I was given a free copy of this book to read and review for my honest opinion.

I'll say up front that I loved Night Walker (review here), and I read Night Thief because I was eager to learn more of her mysterious creatures who are, but are not quite, vampires.Night Thief takes place earlier in history, Paris in the 1840s instead of San Diego California in the present, but we read it after Night Walker, so we know the Night Walkers. Also, the hero of Night Walker was made, while the hero of Night Thief was born. Kane has a much longer history.But the love story doesn't.The greatest enemy of the immortal isn't a weapon, it seems to be boredom. Or ennui. Kane is getting bored. In Paris!Napoleon has just died and Kane is watching the funeral procession when he spots Marguerite. Not for the first time. They've been stalking each other. She wants to rob him, and he wants to catch her. Not because he cares about her thefts, but because the thief known as the Le Voleur D'or shakes him out of his doldrums.Marguerite is more than just a pretty face. She's even more than just a pretty thief. She already knows that the world holds more terrors than even the recent Revolution could have imagined. And that not all those terrors are human. Or at least, not human any longer.Kane sees a spirited woman who has been harmed, and wants to protect her. Needs to protect her. His spirit cries out that he must.Marguerite knows that any man who does not appear between the hours of sunrise and sunset is something otherworldly. Her experience of such is that he must be a monster, just like her master. She has no experience of the otherworld that is not monstrous.It is only when Kane trusts her enough to let her see what he really is, that she discovers that not all who hunt the night are evil. Some protect. This one wants to protect her. At all costs.Even against the vampire who once saved her.Escape Rating B+: Marguerite's dilemma is what catches the reader. She knows that there are things out there, she lives with one. He abuses her every night. Her master is a vampire. She steals in order to get enough money to escape him. Not just for herself, but also for her cousin. The ocean might be enough distance. She doesn't know the bastard is toying with her.Kane is her rescue, but only if she can believe in him. The worst part, for Marguerite, is that Antoine, the vampire, used to be her rescuer. Her father beat her, and Antoine got her out. But that was before he went vampire, of course. Now he's the bad guy, and she needs another white knight. Maybe that should be a red knight. She's aware that being rescued isn't all it's cracked up to be, that rescuers can become victimizers in their turn. Rescuing herself was a better idea, if she could have pulled it off.In some ways, Night Thief doesn't have the depth that Night Walker did. Calisto loved his love for two centuries, he just had to wait for her to be reincarnated. Kane has been around for much, much longer, but his history, stretching back to the Mayan Empire is only hinted at. I'd like to know more about how the Night Walkers came to be, and came to be scattered to the four winds. There's a tragic story in their background, and I want to read it.Guess I'll have to wait for Night Demon to learn more.

Back when I first started blogging I received this awesome novella for review called Across the Veil and there was no looking back. I was obsessed. And Lisa was the first author to truly talk to me and actually be interested in what I had to say so it's fair to say she was my very first author friend. Since then I have totally been stalking (not in a creepy way I promise) all of Lisa's work and I absolutely adored the first installment in the Night Series Night Walker, I mean really who wouldn't love Calisto? So anyway I have been dying to read more from Lisa so I was dying to read Night Thief. A big thank you to the awesome people over at Entangled Publishing for providing me with a review copy.Kane is beautiful, mysterious and super yummy. But he has a secret, he is a Night Walker. Not usually interested in the mortal world it is a surprise when he comes across Marguerite, the woman who thieves to try and improve the life of her and her cousin. Kane cannot resist the mysterious and incredibly beautiful Marguerite but is he chasing after someone who is after nothng more than his riches? Marguerite will do anything to make a better safer life for her and her cousin but when she meets Kane she starts feeling things she has never felt before. But can she trust her heart when it has betrayed her before?I absolutely adored this novella. It was crazy amazing. Lisa's writing style is just absolutely phenomenal. She just instantly draws the attention into this world and you truly become so emotionally invested in these characters where you cannot possibly stop reading until you know what happens. I was completely captured by these new characters and I just had to know what was going to happen. This was a one-sitting read.Kane, *insert dreamy sigh here*. Wow, I never really thought anyone could really beat Calisto but I fell head over heels for Kane. He is so swoon-worthy. He is incredibly sweet and romantic and is definitely the character that every girl will wish was real because he is just incredibly amazing. I also really loved Marguerite. She is such a great character and you see her really grow throughout the book. She is a total kick-ass heroine who will do anything to protect her family and those she cares about and you get to experience everything with her. The fear for hers and her cousin's life, her hesitence at her feelings for Kane and her finally allowing herself to open her heart again.This was without a doubt a fantastic love story and I truly loved every moment of it. I'm pretty sure there is absolutely nothing that Lisa can write that I will not fall head-over-heels in love with. I adored every moment for and I cannot wait for book 2 in the Night Series, Night Demon. No doubt it's going to be absolutely amazing. If you want a short novella you can read fairly quickly filled with heart-stopping romance and pulse-pounding heat this is definitely the book for you. It was incredible!\n\"The thought that he could share his world with Rita for eternity was the greatest temptation he'd ever known.\""}, {"userName": "Karma\u2665Bites ^.~", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10308842-karma-bites", "userReview": "THE SHORT: Steamy and well-written historical PNR blending vampire and shifter lore with an element of ancient Mayan legends. As a prequel, definitely worked to make me want to learn more about this author's world via the full-length novels in the Night series. Recommended for PNR lovers seeking a quick & easy read with a slightly different twist (even those who don\u2019t normally read HR because the historical details don\u2019t predominate).THE LONG: I really enjoyed NIGHT THIEF by NTM author, Lisa Kessler. It combined two of my favorite genres\u2014HR and PNR\u2014and was a perfect choice for a light, sexy read. Given that NIGHT THIEF is a novella, this review is written in very general terms (otherwise, I could give most of the story away).As a mini-intro to the Night series, there was sufficient world-building to carry the storyline. However, I do have some lingering questions as to Kane\u2019s exact nature and beginnings, as well as certain other tidbits, so in that sense, NIGHT THIEF worked to capture my interest enough to read the next book, \u201cNight Walker\u201d, in order to learn more about Kane and others like him.Ms. Kessler did a very good job of quickly drawing sympathetic MCs. Kane is an age-weary immortal resigned to remain apart from the mortals whom he protects. Meanwhile, Marguerite is an independent and creative female seeking freedom from her situation. As expected for a novella, their relationship/romance proceeds very quickly but again, enough is provided by the end so that the reader can believe in their HEA.RE: historical accuracy, I\u2019m not too demanding in my HR reads so I\u2019m usually satisfied if there aren\u2019t glaring errors or inconsistencies. I admit that more than my usual suspension of disbelief was required re: Marguerite\u2019s nighttime activities, and there were a few other minor off-points (but not enough to weaken the story). But overall, I liked how Ms. Kessler incorporated enough background details to maintain the feel of HR (specifically, France in 1840) throughout the story without overwhelming the PNR aspect of NIGHT THIEF.If I had any quibbles with NIGHT THIEF, then they would be more along technical lines (e.g., one character\u2019s dialogue mixed with general narrative or another\u2019s POV), as well as certain mistakes in the small amount of French used in the story. IMVHO, if an author elects to use foreign phrases, then the same should be properly used and punctuated. Why? So that those who know the language won\u2019t mentally wince while others can learn something new correctly. (E.g., the gender of \u201cthief\u201d in French is dependent on the person. Thus, \u201cLa Voleuse d\u2019Or\u201d should\u2019ve been used in the story.)Minor quibbles aside, NIGHT THIEF was a perfect introduction to a NTM author. And based on my experience, I look forward to reading more of Ms. Kessler\u2019s works and perhaps meeting up with Kane and Marguerite in a different story. :)* Review copy provided by the author via the PNR NaUBA group Author/Reader Exchange"}, {"userName": "Shirley Frances", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4983961-shirley-frances", "userReview": "4.25 starsKane has been living among the humans in France since his brothers spread around the world after the fall of the Mayan civilization. As a Night Walker he roams the night feeding on those who mean to cause harm to others and has no tolerance for posturing in France's high society. One night his attention is drawn to a beautiful blond woman who has stolen from another man. He is determined to know more about her and sets out to meet her. However, he was not counting on how he would react to her.Marguerite is a servant of an artist. She steals from rich men who are paying more attention to her beauty than their pockets so she could escape her situation. During her nightly outings she has noticed the handsome man with the gold-tipped cane and set her sights on him. But like Kane, she is not expecting to be drawn to him or to be found out. She is even more surprised by his kindness and tender ways. Even after finding out what he is she can't stay away.Night Thief is a novella in The Night series, but it can be read as a stand alone too. This time around Lisa Kessler brings to the page Kane's story as a Night Walker. I enjoyed how she went about setting the ground for the next book in the series while still telling Kane and Marguerite's romantic tale. What follows are a series of events, revelations and declarations that will keep you engaged in this story until the very end.I appreciated how she brought to the page the connection between Kane and Marguerite in a way that made it seem plausible for these two to get together. They both had their doubts and hesitations, especially Marquerite, which was completely understandable considering her situation, but their attraction was hard to deny and their connection was strong from the beginning and they couldn't stay away from each other. I enjoyed their banter and flirtatious and honest dialogue. It revealed a lot about their personalities, concerns and attraction for each other.The conflict in the story was engaging and interesting too, which only added to my enjoyment of this novella. It was great to learn about Kane and his brothers' story and I am curious to know the Night Walkers and their world. Lisa Kessler managed to pack a lot of history, facts and emotions in this novella and I am certainly looking forward to Night Demon, the next book in the series, which releases on March 18th.I received this title from Entangled Publishing in exchange of my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Katie Michaels", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4669344-katie-michaels", "userReview": "I could easily see the Night Walker series turning into one of my guilty pleasures. For me, it has a little bit of that Christine Feehan Carpathian feel. Old world, powerful heroes who are like vampires, but not quite vampires. Men who cherish their women, treat them like they hung the moon, and have a kind of hot sex with them that feels more sensual than dirty. All that good stuff without any white lightning, molten cores, or velvet over iron.This particular story is kind of sequel, or maybe even a prequel, to Night Walker. It works either way, set in the past of the same world with no overlapping characters. Our hero, Kane, is a Night Walker --a shapeshifter who happens to enter a death-like state during the day and drinks blood to survive. Very different from a vampire -- who enters a death-like state during the day, drinks blood to survive, and terrorizes beautiful young women like our heroine, Marguerite.The lovely Rita is enslaved to an evil vamp --and she is working as pickpocket to earn enough money to escape him with her cousin. She is engaged in a theft when she first catches Kane's eye. He is drawn to her, and as he gets to know her better, that attraction only grows. For the first time in centuries, he is enamored of a mortal and he reaches out for a connection to her.Of course, her vampire master has other ideas. But where would a story be without conflict?I really liked watching Kane fall for Rita and renewing his ability to love someone. Granted, he fell in love with her in, like, five seconds, but still... It's one of those larger than life vampire romances, where he just knows she's the one. The sex is pretty good and I think it was just the right length to tell the story.

This novella surprised me because it was so thorough that it didn't seem possible to be kept to just 109 pages! Very quickly I found myself in a descriptively decadent, action infused telling. Would I trade one monster for another? Would I be able to define what makes a monster? How could I be in love and not put my significant others happiness before my own? Will my faith be enough to stand on and protect me as I battle for my life? These questions were answered by our hero and heroine as I lived vicariously through them. I will be rereading all of her books now that I am reminded of how intriguing her storytelling is. 5 stars attributed to creativity, character maturity and lots of action!

They call her Le Voleur D'or (The golden thief). She noticed his jeweled watch, he noticed her beauty. Each had a mission to run into each other again (albeit not for the same reasons). Marguerite is desperate to get get out from under her \"master\". Men have hurt her in the past and she is always on guard. When Kane catches her going through her \"finds\" (including his jeweled watch); she denies being Le Voleur D'or. Why is she \"finding\" objects? Kane is different, but too much like the men in her past. Can she trust him? Can he help her escape from her \"master\"? What secrets is he hiding?When all is revealed, was more than a jeweled pocket watch stolen? Could they have stolen each others hearts?A full story compacted into a novella. Wonderful writing and an exciting story!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer (random jendsmit)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6164557-jennifer-random-jendsmit", "userReview": "I love this author\u2019s writing! She is just soooooooooo good at what she does. My first thought when I finished reading this was\u2026 WHY DID I NOT READ THIS IN OCTOBER WHEN IT WAS RELEASED?!**yes in caps because I literally yelled at myself**I loved that I didn\u2019t need a refresh on Night Walker to love this book \u2013 it is a completely separate story. IMO, you don\u2019t have to read Night Walker first\u2026 If you want an easy, fast, fun, and well written story look no further \u2013 pick this book up. What else\u2026 oh I loved Kane \u2013 he is awesome \u2013 hands down, one of my favorites <3 old school swoon right there! Marguerite is strong and I really liked that about her. There is action and romance all over this story. I was so not expecting the twist regarding her day job at all!! 4 very solid stars for this novella \u2013 you should check it out"}, {"userName": "Froggarita", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2672626-froggarita", "userReview": "Oh, Lisa Kessler has done it again!! She has captured my imagination with this novella and run off with it! Rita is a beautiful blond who also happens to be an art thief. Kane is all dark and mysterious immortal vampire who protects humans while they sleep. I loved the interaction between the 2 and the chemistry was off the charts! The book was quick paced and kept me enthralled in the story until the very end! My only wish is that the book was longer so I could spend more time with Rita and Kane! I can not wait until book 2 Night Demon!"}, {"userName": "Sin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7758319-sin", "userReview": "Night Thief is another winner for Lisa Kessler. Kane & Rita's story has it all. The distrust turned to love makes your heart ache for this couple. The ending made me cry. I was so happy for them.
