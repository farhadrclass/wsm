And despite all the repetition, there were a few gems in this book, as it is organized quite nicely with an index in the back which I am sure I will consult anytime I need Aquinas' philosophical opinion on the matter.Necessary reading."}, {"userName": "Regan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1973082-regan", "userReview": "I always forget that Thomas is surprisingly funny."}, {"userName": "Nox Prognatus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9970122-nox-prognatus", "userReview": "This book is full of earlier Philosophers work, such as Aristotle, Pseudo-Dionysus, Boethius etc.. it does have Aquinas own take on matters. The book skips back and forth and is very repetitive for the few gems within. one thing is clear, that Aquinas was borrowed out of context by Catholicism and the fact he draws heavily on Earlier Greek philosophy proves it. Some really good sections on life after death, energy and soul. Overall I found the reading repetitive and tedious in places."}, {"userName": "Rosemary Reilly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8544946-rosemary-reilly", "userReview": "Of course, I didn't read all of it.

It's fairly standard Aquinas. If you don't want to spend the money on Aquinas' actual volumes, I would recommend this text and the one called \"Selected Writings\" published by Penguin. I would start with this one, and then move on to the Penguin one. It's a good way to understand Aquinas' main conclusions and arguments (albeit this is just brushing the snow off, not even scratching the surface. Aquinas runs deep...) and figuring out if Aquinas is the kind of thinker you resonate with."}], "description": "St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) saw religion as part of the natural human propensity to worship. His ability to recognize the naturalness of this phenomenon and simultaneously to go beyond i - to explore, for example, spiritual revelation - makes his work as fresh and readable today as it was seven centuries ago.This accessible new translation offers thirty-eight substantial passages not only from the indispensable Summa Theologicae, but from many other works, fully illustrating the breadth and progression of Aquinas's philosophy. It is an ideal introduction to this key figure in the philosophy of religion.", "title": "Selected Philosophical Writings", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25713.Selected_Philosophical_Writings", "average": 3.87, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327998033l/25713.jpg", "reviews": 11, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/158904.Thomas_Aquinas", "name": "Thomas Aquinas"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/475899.Timothy_McDermott", "name": "Timothy McDermott"}], "type": ["Philosophy", "Religion", "Religion", "Nonfiction", "Classics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25713.Selected_Philosophical_Writings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5751038-selected-philosophical-writings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25709.Summa_Theologica_5_Vols", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1392018.Watch_for_the_Light", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25711.Selected_Writings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25714.On_Law_Morality_and_Politics", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25712.On_Politics_and_Ethics"]}
