Jenny B. Jones\u2019 debut novel, In Between, is a hysterical read. Katie Parker\u2019s mom is in prison, and Katie is shipped off to live with pretend-o-parents, James and Millie Scott in the small town of In Between, Texas . When Katie discovers her new foster dad is a pastor, she dresses Goth for the first day of school, certain Millie won\u2019t let her out of the house. Her plans backfire and Katie is not only forced to go to school with black fingernails, but ends up sitting at the Goth table at lunch, seeing as that\u2019s where she looks to fit in. Unfortunately, a couple of her new friends are not the best influence, and Katie unknowingly is recruited for a midnight vandalism jaunt to the local vintage theater. Katie is the only teen nabbed by the coppers, who take her down to the station and inform her that the Scotts are the owners of the theater. Humiliated, Katie waits for her foster parents to send her packing. They don\u2019t, however, and Katie experiences some awesome tough love for the first time in her life. Katie struggles to adapt to her new, strange world, which includes church, smart friends, a massive dog, and a crazy foster grandma who rides a bicycle built for two. She tries out for the school play and falls for a cute and troublesome senior guy. Her new friend doesn\u2019t approve, foster granny doesn\u2019t approve, but Katie\u2019s of the opinion that what the Scott\u2019s don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them. It\u2019s a good thing God is watching out for Katie Parker, even though she doesn\u2019t have a clue. It\u2019s one comical situation after another with Katie Parker, whose fun, sarcastic voice keeps you turning the pages so fast they catch fire. This is a must read for teen girls\u2026and girls of any age! Looking forward to book two. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Ivie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70609243-ivie", "userReview": "Oh my goodness, what an amazing book! At first, it was slow and boring for me. A lot of telling instead of showing was happening. Then, Katie got snarkier and snarkier. I didn't want to put this book down. I think I have found another author to add to my list of favorites. (It doesn't hurt that her name sounds similar to a childhood favorite book series of mine.)Story WorldContemporary Texas in the fictional town of In Between. Not much to say, except it's a small town, which is so dreamy to me. PlotThe plot follows Katie Parker as she navigates life with her foster family. Life has been rough on her and she has had a lot of hardship. But she's tough. She can handle the things life throws at her. CharactersKatie, obviously, her foster parents, Pastor Scott and Millie Scott. Her crazy foster grandma, also known as Mad Maxine. Okay, Mad Maxine is an awesome grandma who definitely keeps people on their toes. There's Francis, who slowly becomes Katie's bestie. Oh, and the small mention of Charlie, but peeps, I ship it hard already. ContentSo totally clean! I am so happy about this. When I got this book, I knew it would probably be clean because I knew the author was Christian. I was extremely happy about that. Also, don't think because there aren't swear words that this book doesn't touch tough subjects. It does with grace and the faith that can move mountains, okay. Speaking of, for those of you who like clean books, but aren't into Christian reads, don't you worry. While faith in the Lord is a subject in this book, Jenny B. Jones talks about faith without being overly preachy. Believe me when I say preachy books get on my nerves. This book inspired me and showed me that a light right can impact you as well. I didn't like that the \"he\" when referring to God wasn't capitalized, just a pet peeve of mine, but that's really my only complaint about this book. This book comes free on kindle and I'm so happy I downloaded it. I will be buying more in the series as soon as my book budget actually becomes a thing. (Any one want to donate to the Books for Ivie fundraiser?) (Just kidding, I made that up.)OverallThis book, while not action packed or high adventure, still managed to hold my attention and make me want to know more. The description of the next book already tells me tough subjects will be touched and I know I want to read it as soon as possible. I definitely recommend this book. I just wish I would have known about this author in my early teen years. But, I know about her now. *This book is free on kindle and I highly recommend you try it."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2790490-katie", "userReview": "While I am a big suspense reader, every so often I like picking up a book that will make me laugh from start to finish. In Between achieved that desire to the fullest! From the first chapter, Katie\u2019s personality and dry sense of humor had me grinning from ear to ear. Be prepared to get many weird looks from people around you as you all but roll in laughter, but this book was sooo worth looking like a fool. LOL!Jenny B. Jones did an amazing job at writing the main character, Katie. Nothing about Katie Parker is shallow! Wow! Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a teen myself and could totally relate and understand Katie. Her exaggerated style of communicating and thinking was hilarious! With that said, I admit that there was a few times I wished Katie would be serious. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but the constant flow of exaggeration and dry humor got a wee bit old once in a while\u2026but then she would say something that totally cracked me up and I\u2019d be laughing all over again! So be forewarned, this Katie doesn\u2019t have a serious bone in her body! :-PThe other characters in In Between were also well written and memorable. I loved all the different layers her foster parents had that Katie slowly pulled back as the story progressed. Maxine, to me, was a bit of an overkill. Not in a bad way, but I didn\u2019t see her as very realistic. Frances was lots of fun, though her story wasn\u2019t exactly finished when the book ended. Wonder how it will continue in the next book! With Jenny\u2019s vivid and bold writing style, she brings the small town of In Between, Texas to life through the voice of Katie Parker. I would recommend this book to teen girls of any ages. Not guys (if I guy would pick up a book that so obviously has \u201cteen girl\u201d written all over it. My brother wouldn\u2019t get within ten feet of it!). There\u2019s a lot of girl-related crude humor, but if you\u2019re a girl, it\u2019s nothing that extreme. While shopping Katie gets overly excited about a push-up bra and pants that make her look like she actually has a butt. There\u2019s mention of Katie asking her foster mom for tampons and towards the end she sticks a bunch of tissues inside her bra right before a play so she can fit her costume. There\u2019s also a cross-dresser at her school that she hangs out with in the first part of the book (totally weird, if you ask me!) Like I said before, I personally don\u2019t think it would be too much for a teen girl to read. But that\u2019s just me.In Between easily got 5 stars from me. Not only was it a fun read, but the lesson\u2019s Katie learns throughout the book are also really good. Addressing the subjects of life as a foster kid, hanging with the wrong crowd, and a wayward child, there are many things to be learned in Katie\u2019s world. I highly recommend this to any reader who needs a good, lighthearted story that is sure to make you laugh."}, {"userName": "Goddess Of Blah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4234324-goddess-of-blah", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Salha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38220390-salha", "userReview": "At first I thought I was going to hate this book. Katie's behavior and comments made me roll my eyes every second throughout the first ten chapters of so. I felt as if I was reading about a twelve-year old girl, instead of a sixteen-year old.After the Valiant incident, I began to see some change within Katie. I really liked where the character development took her, she kicked all those bad expectations people had of her in the butt. Way to go, Katie! I've seen people complaining a lot about this being a Christian novel. They say that they had all the \"God stuff\" thrown to their faces, but I really didn't see it that way. And I'm not a Christian myself. Maybe it's due to the fact that I was raised by Catholic parents, and everyone in my family considers themselves Catholics (I'm the black sheep, ha). And my everyday life is kind of like Katie's, with my parents telling me to pray all the time, and going to church every Sunday, etc.Anyway, returning to the book review... I really liked how this book turned out in the end. It even showed that Frances, who everyone deemed as \"perfect\", had things she disliked and that got her angry.I was left in a massive cliffhanger after I read the first chapter of the second book in this series.

Having never read anything by Jenny B. Jones before, I had no idea of her writing style and I've read a few other books dealing with characters in the foster care system and I was dreading wading through the sad reality of the very real struggles and injustices of foster care in general. I quickly found myself drawn in by Katie and her situation. This kid has my sense of humor! The deeper I got into the book, the deeper it felt like Jenny B. Jones had stepped into my own highschool mind with Katie's quick wit and sarcasm. I LOVED IT! I don't think I've ever laughed so hard or fallen in love with characters so fast before. You simply MUST read this book! The entire series had me laughing so hard my sides ached and tears poured down my face as my heart embraced Katie and her... life. I can't say it enough.

Seriously, you\u2019ll find yourself, smiling, laughing and just enjoying this light, funny story about a teen-aged foster child.

When Katie gets to In Between, she\u2019s thrown into a life that\u2019s as foreign to her as if she were living in a different country. Her foster dad is a pastor, her foster mom is loving, caring, and cooks hearty, tasty meals for her family. Her foster grandmother is a cuckoo woman who gets on Katie\u2019s nerves. As Katie tries to fit into her new family, it turns out to be a long, lesson-filled journey for her. She tries to find herself while trying out different elective classes in school, and she sits with a different crowd each day during lunch \u2013 trying to figure out where she belongs in her new school. She finds out the hard way that not everybody is her friend in her new environment. Katie also starts going to church and becomes friends with Frances, a beautiful, upbeat, Christian girl that helps Katie during her transition to the new town.Katie\u2019s foster parents harbor secrets and Katie is determined to find out what, exactly, causes the undercurrent of disharmony in her new home.This was a light, funny read and if you like young adult fiction, then you should give this book a try."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2039502-hannah", "userReview": "I LOVE Jenny B.

I fell in love with Charmed Life. Every single book just made me Laugh out Loud and have a great time enjoying a fun, fresh story. Same with Katie Parker. This is an LOL book! I loved Katie's character. She's struggling at the beginning to deal with family problems and adjusting to a new foster home and fitting in, but right from the start her humor side is present. As she grows throughout the story, discovering herself along the way it's just so ugh fun to be with her. I don't know how much more I can say without repeating myself. Jenny just has this incredible sense of humor that is so fun and she really gets into the heads of her girls and you just want to laugh and cry along with her heroines.

Jones has the funniest dialog. Her books are so good to read just for the laughs. Even if the story lines aren't even captivating me, I'd still wanna read her stories just for the dialog.This one is cute and heartbreaking at the same time. It's highly empathic but at the same time fun to read, and the author pulls that mix off in compelling ways. Jenny B. Jones understands teenagers and the way they think. She definitely has carved out time to write how a 'teenage foster care girl' should feel, but she adds her quirks to it so its not so heavy handed a read all the time.

The rest of the time, she was the mid-forties master of sarcasm and wit on steroids. Yes, she was hilarious. Or just plain cynical. Or way-too-insensitive.

Four stars for a book that kept me hooked, the ever-need topic of fostering and hurting teenagers, and just an overall fun read.

Church was good, goth was bad, all teenagers hang out with their exact group and only talk about their one interest. That's not what high school, or life, is really like. There were quite a few racist and homophobic people in my church, and the alternative kids in my HS were some of the nicest and easy going kids there.

The characters, the set, the plotline\u2014everything! There was just enough twists, turns, and mystery to keep me wondering, but the characters were enough to make me want to finish it. It was a true story of a girl adapting to a new home. I greatly look forward to reading the second.Katie is a hysterical main charater. She\u2019s always got another [sassy] comment, another idea, another opinion of the world. I laughed out loud several times thanks to Katie\u2019s witty remarks. While her backdrop paints a picture of more criminal activity, Katie knows right from wrong and after an incident at the theatre, she is more than determined to be a good kid. For example, at first she\u2019s totally opposed to \u201cperfect girl\u201d Frances Vega, but soon, that changes when she realizes her crazy friends are no-good and out for trouble.\u2028Full of questions and out for adventure, I loved Katie. All together, Katie\u2019s life is nothing but ordinary.\u201cMad\u201d Maxine, Katie\u2019s \u201cevil\u201d foster grandma, was another character altogether. She had me laughing at times and grimacing at others. Katie, very, very wary of the woman, was certain she was pure evil, but to me, she mostly seemed plain out crazy. The story is told from Katie\u2019s point of view, and since Katie is convinced Maxine is wicked, that\u2019s how the story comes out\u2014creative writing in my opinion. Overall I found Maxine a fun addition to the story. I found interest in seeing the shenanigans Maxine came up with, and Katie\u2019s reactions to her foster grandma\u2019s crazy ideas.James and Millie Scott, Katie\u2019s foster parents, are painted wonderfully. They play the role of the encouraging parents while still worrying for Katie and her safety. James, a pastor at the church, aids Katie in her search for faith and for God. Pretty early on we learn of Amy, the Scotts\u2019 daughter, who, for some reason, doesn\u2019t live with them anymore\u2014or anywhere around. Whenever she is brought up, there is tension and silence in the house, providing another occasion for Katie to wonder on. The story was very intriguing in that matter.Frances Vega: what an interesting person, right? At first, Katie is annoyed by her \u201cperfect girl\u201d act, but as she comes to know her, she realizes Frances is actually fit to be a pretty good friend. And after dinner with her, she discovers Frances does have certain elements to her life that aren\u2019t exactly \u201cperfect.\u201d I liked Frances\u2019s character and enjoyed seeing how it worked out between her and Katie.\u2028Overall, this was a stunning book. Beautiful writing, incredible character depth, and an intriguing storyline. You won\u2019t be disappointed!Like my reviews?

When I got this book in amazon I didn't thought I was going to have such a good time reading it. I don't normally read christian books but this one let me wanting more. It was so funny and there was a part a laughed so hard I even woke up my aunt (I was reading it in the night and it was really late). This was a sweet and an easy read story where the main characters is Katie,and is told from her POV.\"Katie Parker is about to get a new life\u2014whether she wants one or not. With her mom in prison, and her father AWOL, Katie is sent to live with a squeaky-clean family who could have their own sitcom. She launches a full-scale plan to get sent back to the girls\u2019 home when she finds herself in over her head...and heart. When Katie and her new \"wrong crowd\" get into significant trouble at school, she finds her punishment is restoring a historic theater with a crazy grandma who goes by the name of Mad Maxine. In the midst of her punishment, Katie uncovers family secrets that run deep, and realizes she's not the only one with a pain-filled past. Katie must decide if she'll continue her own family\u2019s messed up legacy or embrace a new beginning in this place called In Between.\"I have to say that my favorite character was Maxine the foster grandma. She's funny, crazy and has so much energy. Sometimes she remained me of my grandpa,which I love so much; I think that's why I liked her so much. I will totally keep reading this series, and I hope the next book is as good as this one."}, {"userName": "Katrina Burchett", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1393133-katrina-burchett", "userReview": "When her mother was given a prison sentence for selling drugs, Katie Parker was sent to the Sunny Haven Home for girls. She\u2019d been at the home for six months and had just started to figure out how to survive there when she had to move. Pastor James Scott and his wife, Millie had agreed to take Katie in as their foster daughter. Katie had felt alone most of her life and she had to deal with difficult situations beyond her control, so for her there was no hope for a better day. She questioned God\u2019s love for her and she wasn\u2019t too sure about this couple in their fifties; especially since her new foster father was a Pastor. Residing in the home of a man of God certainly wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d agree to if she\u2019d been given a choice. But Mrs. Iola Smartly, the woman who ran things at Sunny Haven, knew she had taken Katie to the right place.Occasionally I do judge a book by its cover. I saw this one and immediately thought it\u2019d be a fun read, and it was. As I read Katie Parker\u2019s story I was entertained by her wit, and although her foster grandmother, Maxine, seemed a little off (not quite there, on the brink of insanity, peculiar, downright strange) her personality and shenanigans brought even more enjoyment. Again, this was a fun read!"}, {"userName": "Juli Hoffman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41350064-juli-hoffman", "userReview": "Loved it! A Heartwarming Clean YA That ISN'T Sickening SweetThe first couple of chapters were a little rough. The words didn't exactly sound like those of a sixteen year old girl. That said, I'm so glad I kept on reading.This is the story of Katie Parker and her new foster family. While most YA novels turn sixteen year old protagonists into angsty, lovesick morons, Katie is intelligent and strong. She grows as a character. She helps those around her without sappy. She has a hefty amount of sarcastic wit. I enjoyed reading her story and found myself crying more than a few times, completely drawn into her world. Her story rang with truth, even in a fictional tale.*This story does have Christian characters, but it was handled in a non offensive manner. I don't usually read \"Christian YA Lit,\" but I really enjoyed this book. I'll be reading the next book in the series. I'm not a teen, but I enjoy reading books with strong female characters. Katie is a great character. I'd recommend this book to anyone, but especially to YA girls."}, {"userName": "Zoe Race", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56506714-zoe-race", "userReview": "Awesome book! I mean, its amazing! I have NEVER read a book with so many jokes, good sarcasm and depth I it. Katie Parker is SO funny! I loved all the characters and couild relate to them somewhat. The end was a huge turnabout for me. So glad they made it realistic!Katie's story comes from \"none wants me-so I don't care\" to a life worth living. Her obvious passions, and love for her friends and parents touches my heart. This story is about how a foster girl, seemingly a mess, lightens the life of those around her. I also love this book for involving her growing belief in God. I just love Kathie. And I'm sure YOU will. Please read this book (it is definitely worth it!)-a very energetic reader of this book!
