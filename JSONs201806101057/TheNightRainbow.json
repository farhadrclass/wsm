Tugging because inside its pages I met a child whose voice, whose world, whose entire existence was so utterly perfectly realised.We met in southern France in a blisteringly hot summer when Pea \u2013 short for Peony \u2013 was just five and a half years old. She spent that summer outside, running wild in the country and in her own imagination, with her little sister, Margot, in tow.Maman stayed inside. She was heavily pregnant and she had withdrawn from the world, since she lost a child late in an earlier pregnancy, since Papa was killed in an accident.Pea tried to help, tried to be good, tried to draw her mother back into the world, but nothing worked.As they wandered in the countryside Pea and Margot met a man who had withdrawn from the world too. He was called Claude, and his dog was called Merlin. He took an interest in the girls, he was kind, but he kept a distance.There is sadness and loss threaded through the lives of Pea, Margot, Maman and Claude. It never quite goes away, but nor does the sense of how wonderful the world is, and what a grand thing it is to be alive.There\u2019s little that can be said about the story that doesn\u2019t say too much. But I can say that it is beautifully constructed, with gentle twists and turns that are never obvious but always right. And I can say that it is told in a voice that is captivating and so very, very real. A voice that always rang true.Pea pulled me into her world, and she made me see and feel things as she did. I felt the sun beating down. I saw the parched grass and the meadows full of flowers. I tasted the baguettes that were delivered every morning, the peaches that were there to be pulled from the trees.And she made me want to be five and a half, to take such delight in the world, to notice so many important things, to be caught in flights of fancy and amusement, to watch the strange ways adults behave from the sidelines, and most of all to have the faith in the world that comes from living in the moment.But though I saw the magic in Pea\u2019s life I saw the danger too, the loneliness and that neglect. Light and shade.That made me want to be a grown-up again, so that I could talk to people, so that I could do something to help. I don\u2019t know what, but I had been drawn in, and I cared. Because Pea\u2019s acute childish observation, the wealth of detail, the myriad observations, allowed me to see adult emotions and sitautions that she couldn\u2019t comprehend.There were just one or two moments when I wondered if Pea was just a little wise, a little too capable for her age. But maybe that was the result of her life and situation.I was caught up in Pea\u2019s world, and in her life, from the first page to the very last. And she still hasn\u2019t quite let go.And, of course, for all of this to work so beautifully, there had to be an intelligent and sensitive writer working in the background: Claire King pulled the strings quietly, invisibly, and I am intrigued to see what she might do next."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "The Night Rainbow is an excellent novel written from the perspective of a five-year-old, an odd character for adult literature but still a girl with a lot to say. She and her younger sister try in their own simplistic ways to understand why life isn't everything it should be. Their pregnant mother retreats into her \"sadness\" and becomes reclusive, still grieving the sudden loss of her husband and also her miscarried infant from prior times. Their father was taken by an untimely accident, leaving them to deal with their broken family on their own. When they meet Claude, everything suddenly seems to be looking up. Claude is a kind but sad man, and often the girls see him and his dog and finally feel like there's someone else in the world who cares about them - but the rest of the town begs to differ, sensing something falsely suspicious about Claude's behavior. This book can take some getting used to if you've never read writing from a child's point-of-view before, and at times it's a very sad story of neglect and mental illness, but all the same it's a wonderful book of coming to terms with life and death and trying to start over."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "No rating causes me as much consternation and angst as the three-star rating. In my time on Goodreads, I've used it to mean everything from 'this was a great concept/something I was really looking forward to, but the execution was quite poor' to 'this was a really good book, but it just lacked something/wasn't essentially my kind of thing'. The Night Rainbow is another should-have-been-3-and-a-half (but I can't quite bring myself to give it 4). Claire King's debut is a thoroughly charming tale, full of atmosphere and laced with sadness.Five-year-old Pea (short for Peony) and her younger sister Margot live in the South of France with their English mother. The story is set over the course of one very hot summer when Pea and Margot are left to roam the countryside surrounding their farm largely unchecked. Their mother is heavily pregnant and depressed, having lost both her previous baby and the girls' father within the year. Pea and Margot play together every day in the fields, inventing games and trying to work out what they can do to help their mother and make her happy again. Then they meet Claude, a loner who befriends them and dazzles them with gifts - sweets, a treehouse, even bicycles. However, the reader sees what the adults in the village see: that Claude's interest in the children is worrying, and that the family desperately needs outside help.I received a copy of The Night Rainbow from Netgalley, and I have to admit that I probably wouldn't have read it otherwise. The reason for that sentiment is that Pea narrates the story herself, and I am emphatically not a fan of child narrators. It's testament to the author's ability that I really enjoyed this book despite that. Pea's voice is authentically childlike, but rarely irritating, and it's very effective at evoking the atmosphere of the French countryside, the magic and the boredom of village life, and the stifling heat of summer. I didn't find it difficult to get drawn into the story and enjoy Pea's innocent, imaginative descriptions of the world around her.There's a significant twist in this book which I guessed fairly early on, and I'm not sure whether or not I was supposed to. I did feel the reader was definitely meant to figure it out on their own - as there's no proper reveal - but the fact that I spotted it quickly affected my reading of the book thereafter, as I was looking for further clues or suggestions in the narrative. How soon you see it will probably depend on how closely you examine the story: some readers will probably guess right at the beginning, others might manage to make it all the way through to the end without realising. I will say that the author did an excellent job of weaving this secret into the narrative - there are many parts that must have been incredibly difficult to write without making it obvious.My other (semi-)complaint is that there just isn't very much to the plot. The description in the blurb is, I think, a bit misleading: it didn't seem there was that much suspicion or secrecy surrounding Claude, and the situation wasn't played for drama like it might have been in a different kind of book. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but I was expecting more tension in the build-up to the book's climax. And the night rainbow itself doesn't really have much significance - apart from being a reminder of the power of imagination, which is the key element of the story.The Night Rainbow is a slow-paced, sedate book, highly redolent of the haze of summer and the enchantment of childhood. In this, it reminded me of The Book of Summers by Emylia Hall, and I would probably have enjoyed it more if I'd read it on a suitably hot and sunny day rather than finishing it while quite literally snowed in to my house! If you enjoy stories with child narrators, you're going to love this. If, like me, you're not usually keen, this book may very well convert you. While I feel it lacks the impact needed to be truly memorable, it's sweet and engaging - but save it for the summer."}, {"userName": "Deborah Pickstone", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37849334-deborah-pickstone", "userReview": "A rather charming debut novel that deals with death and childhood sensitively and believably.

I think it's strange my mouth would do that. The rest of my head knows she's never there.\u201d This was something i never read before. I came across this book at a Bookconvention and thought that it would be fun to read from a little girls perspective. Well Pea, short for Peony, is the most smart and beautiful little five year old i have ever read about. We meet Pea in a very troubling time in her life. Her mother is depressed, because of the los of her baby and her husband, Peony's father died in a accident and now she is all alone with her little sister Margot and her imagination. Pea is quite grown-up for her age, but i think that that comes from the surcomestances in her life. She is trying to make her mother happy and is trying to run the household. When Pea and Margot run around the counrtyside the meet a man, Claude. There is a kind of sadness about him, but he had taken an interessed in the little girls, he is kind to them, plays with them but keeps his distance. There is sadness and loss threaded through the lives of Pea, Margot, Maman and Claude. It never quite goes away, but nor does the sense of how wonderful the world is, and what a grand thing it is to be alive.There is little to say about this story without giving to much away. What i can say about this book is that it is beautifully constructed, with twists and turns that are never obvious. The voice in which Pea is portraid is so true to character, you really see the world through a little girls eyes. She made me want to be five and a half, to take such delight in the world, to notice so many important things, to be caught in flights of fancy and amusement, to watch the strange ways adults behave from the sidelines, and most of all to have the faith in the world that comes from living in the moment.Although there was a lot of magic in Pea's life i saw alot of danger too. The loneliness, the neglect.. every alarm sign went off. It made me want to shake her mother to realisation, look at your little girl, she is still here.. she needs you! All i can say about this book is that i felt true and it was a story that pulled on your heartstrings. The reason that i didn't rated this 5 or 4 stars is the fact that some times i couldn't deal with the 5 year old perspective, i would have liked to see some some perspectives. It is a beautifull story but the ending also felt a little bit rushed, it was there in a second out of nowhere. To leave this at a positive note, read this book, it tells you so much about the world and teaches you so much!

It's the kind of story that makes you want to adopt the main character; to jump through the pages, run in, and make it all right -- but we can only watch as Pea tries to mend her family.This is the voice of a small girl, written by a mother of small girls. It's as charming as it sounds, with the clear, simple voice of the child interspersed with those flashes of intuition that five-year-olds produce occasionally, just to remind us that they understand more than we know.

Set in Southern France, during a blistering hot summer, this is the story of five year old Pea aka Peony aka Pivoine and her younger sister Margot. Their mother has retreated into herself following a miscarriage and the later death of their Papa. Maman is heavily pregnant again but Pea and Margot are left to their own devices, wandering the countryside where they meet up with Claude, a middle aged man with whom they strike up a friendship. Not everyone approves of their friendship but Maman's absence, both physical and emotional, means that the girls have to fend for themselves.Narrated by Pea, this is a beautifully written story with equal amounts of joy and sadness. Pea and Margot's interactions will make you smile as they strive to make a plan to cheer up Maman but the smiles quickly vanish when their efforts fall flat. Yes, there is sadness here but the overall mood is one of optimism as Pea just bounces back and looks for another remedy for her mother's despair.The author has captured Pea's five year old voice perfectly, that eternal optimism, the desire to live in the moment, the clarity of vision which can see when grown-ups are just overthinking and making things more complicated than what they really are. One could learn a lot from a child like Pea. This is a sparkling, quirky, captivating debut, highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Phil", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8674143-phil", "userReview": "This book made me laugh and cry, something which rarely happens for me..... the writing is lyrical and beautiful, the story is all embracing; impossible to put down, and the twists are subtle and satisfying.

I normally read crime and psychological thrillers, so it was refreshing to look at another genre for a change. In a nutshell it is about how a little girl copes with her mother heavily pregnant (and barely capable of scraping a meal together) and an absent (deceased) father. It takes place during a hot summer in rural France and follows Pea as she explores her world, tries to make sense of what is happening and struggles to look after herself.The writing is fresh, original, poignant, funny, evocative and atmospheric. The language is gorgeous - the voice of five year old Pea spot on in pitch and content. 'I stare my eyes hard so the tears can't get out.''Her face is the most wrinkled face I know. It looks like a peach stone sucked clean.''It is hot, but in a nice way, as though the storm put the sticky summer in a washing machine...'Truly aspirational for any writer, in the detail, observations and imagery through Pea's naive and innocent eyes. And for any reader - this is pure delight.

Sometimes secrets are secrets because that's the best way.\u201d\"The Night Rainbow\", follows Pea and her little sister, Margot as they spend their days running free, inventing games in the meadow behind their house. But Pea starts to worry, because recently her father has died in an accident, and her mother has just lost a baby. Pea's mother is English so she is already isolated in this small French village and begins to retreat even further. Pea and Margot stay out of her way and try to make things better. When Pea and Margot met Claude on one of their outdoor adventures they find that he loves the meadow just as much as them\u2026but Claude is hiding a secret\u2026King decided to tell this story from Pea's (five and a half year old) perspective. I think it was an overall good choice, but there were times I was a little sick of reading from her perspective. Because of her young age the writing is very choppy, but I did think it was necessary for the story to be told in this way. It all comes down to tastes I suppose. Pea has this wonderful imagination and outlook of the world. She is smart and loves the outdoors. I appreciated how King chose to write her with simple yet profound words. Claude and Margot are also great characters. I was very much invested and wondering how things were going to play out in the end, even though I guessed the \"twist\" halfway in, it still made for a beautiful story.Metaphors are something I love in books. This story is certainly full of them aka: the night rainbow. I really think this is a perfect book for a book club to read, because there are so many thought provoking and unanswered questions at the end. Personally, I think this did not hinder the story but made it better. Not all books need to wrap up nicely in the end, but need to make us think about these characters and the authors intent on writing them. How else will they stay with us long after we read about them?"}, {"userName": "Patrice Hoffman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5405898-patrice-hoffman", "userReview": "I can't say I've read any books written from the perspective of a child as young as Five and a half. The Night Rainbow by Claire King provides us with the voice of Pea who lives in the south of France with her younger sister Margot, and her mother. Pea is tasked with helping her mother feel happier after having lost her husband and child in the same year and with helping her sister Margot create new games for them to play in their expansive fields. Pea and Margot are definitely independant, fun loving children who do a great job at carrying this novel with their adventures. Pea's voice of innocence works well not to bring the tone of the story down although there is much to be sad about. The mother is pregnant and highly depressed after being dealt such a hard blow of losing her husband. Pea can't seem to make her happy and she gets the brilliant idea of asking their new found friend Claude to be their new Papa. Did I fail to mention Claude? Well Claude and his dog Merlin befriends the girls by giving them gifts and spending time with them. I know, I know. Claire King writes spectacularly from a child's point of view using vivid imagery with fantastical qualities only imagination can provide. I actually felt sorry for Pea most of the novel because I felt she was neglected and left to deal with life on her own but she still seemed happy. She's only aware of the danger that a child would encounter such as going to use the bathroom in the middle of the night or having a nightmare. The reader is aware that the mother pretty much checked out which is maddening as well as heartbreaking. Pea doesn't see what we the readers are able to see through experience and that's why her friendship with Claude kept me glued to the pages with angst. Overall, I really enjoyed this atmospheric novel written by Claire King. There are many reasons this novel could be sad for readers but the light-hearted air of Pea's voice, recounting her summer adventures enables this novel to be pretty enjoyable. I long for the days when I didn't have a care in the world and could see things through a child's eye. I recommend this novel for all who long for those days as well."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8311803-emma", "userReview": "First of all let me just say ... this book made me feel all the feels!The Night Rainbow is a beautifully written book about 5 year old Pea and her Maman (Mother). After the death of her new born baby and her husband Joanna is in a serious depression, neglecting her daughter and spending all of her time in bed. Pea and Margot look after themselves, spending their days out in the meadow and in the beautiful French countryside. Maman does not feed them properly or bathe them and they are basically left to fend for themselves. They meet Claude and his dog Merlin and an unlikely friendship is formed, while I was suspicious of Claude's intentions at first we learn that he really is just a kind hearted man who is trying to help. He gives the girls food and attention and nurtures them.The writing in this book and the descriptions were fantastic, I really felt like I was right there in the French countryside with Pea, I could taste the peaches, olives, baguettes and biscuits as she ate them. I could feel the hot summer breeze and her loneliness, I was COMPLETELY lost in this book.I adored Pea as a character, Claire King does an amazing job of capturing the innocence of a five year old and it made me nostalgic. I think we'd all like to be children again to go back and see things as magical and wonderful in the way Pea does. The relationships were both heart warming and heart wrenching at the same time. They were always believable and I cried a few times while reading this book. I loved how all of the characters developed and matured throughout the book. There were times when I wanted to jump into the pages and comfort Pea and give Maman a piece of my mind but everything worked out for the best I feel.I completely adored this book it is a summer read in my opinion and I will be fishing it out again to reread next year for sure.5 out of 5 stars!!"}, {"userName": "Annette S.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9699614-annette-s", "userReview": "Telling a story, especially an adult story, from the point of view of a child is a very difficult thing to get right. Among authors who have been successful in achieving this are Emma Donoghue in Room, John Boyne in The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas and John Harding in Florence & Giles. With the publication of The Night Rainbow, Claire King joins their ranks.Pea and her sister Margot live with their English mother in the south of France.

Pea tells us that maman \u2018left her happiness in the hospital with the baby,\u2019 a miscarriage from the previous year.Pea and Margot spend their days playing in the meadow, searching for the one thing that will make their mother happy again and it is here they meet Claude, a mysterious man with a limp and a dog with whom the girls become fast friends.King uses a mix of language in the book. Through Pea\u2019s eyes we see the meadows and streams as magical places filled with fairies and wonder. But it is the matter of fact way in which Pea deals with her mother\u2019s negligence where the author\u2019s talents really shine. The way Ms King shows us how a five year old child interprets her mother\u2019s depression is skillful and believable and my heart went out to Pea.

I read this through in one day, beginning to end. It has short chapters, which made it easy to put down when I needed to see to dinner or tuck my daughter into bed. The short chapters also made it easy to sneak one in while tending a pot on the stove or waiting for my daughter to finish her bedtime routine. The writing style was different, and a welcome change of pace. (If you don't care for it after a couple of chapters, this may not be the book for you.) Reading about the south of France makes almost any book a great beach read, but King's narrative style was what really drew me in. This story is told from the perspective of a very precocious girl nearly my daughter's age, and the characterization was spot on.

It has been promised that the book is \u2018an unforgettable novel about innocence and experience, grief and compassion and the dangers of an overactive imagination\u2019.The Night Rainbow is told from the first person perspective of five-year-old Peony, called by the affectionate nickname of Pea. Pea lives on the edge of a small village in the South of France, along with her heavily pregnant English mother and four-year-old Margot. Their mother, Joanna, is overwhelmed by grief. Pea tells us in her honest voice how, when her mother came back from hospital the preceding year, \u2018She had changed from fat to thin, but she didn\u2019t bring back a baby like she promised. She left it at the hospital, along with her happiness\u2019. Despite being pregnant again, Joanna has the added sadness of having to contend with the bottomless well of grief left after her French husband Amaury\u2019s death: \u2018One day in spring, he was driving his tractor on a hill and he fell off it and was squashed\u2026 Without Papa here there is never a very good time to be in the house, so every day we have to decide where to go\u2019.Pea\u2019s voice is captured immediately, and many childish proclamations are woven throughout: \u2018half of me is sunny and hot because I\u2019m sitting in a ribbon of outside\u2019, Pea tells us. When introducing herself and Margot, she says, \u2018Margot is like me and she is not like me. I am five and a half, Margot is only four, but she\u2019s tall for her age. We both like cuddles and insects and cuddling insects and we both have freckles and green eyes, like Maman\u2026 In the sunlight Maman\u2019s eyes are kaleidoscopes\u2019. The girls are endearing from the outset. Pea describes the way in which \u2018Margot dreams about tiny people that live in the cupboards and have parties on Thursdays, and about jigsaws that make themselves\u2019.Such childish magic has been included that it is difficult not to love the very bones of the girls from the first chapter. Margot quickly assumes the role of mother on their daily rambles: \u2018Pea, look at you, you haven\u2019t even got a hat on\u2019, and \u2018Today I am the maman, she says, so you will do as you\u2019re told\u2019. The girls have taken it upon themselves to try and find Maman\u2019s lost happiness. \u2018There are more than a thousand things in the world,\u2019 Margot reasons, \u2018and one of them must make Maman happy\u2019. The girls are self-sufficient and often fix their own meals. They even take it upon themselves, in one particularly sad passage, to wash their clothes as Maman has forgotten to. Their love for Maman, and for each other, is touching.Whilst on a trip to a nearby meadow to get out of the oppressive house, the girls meet a middle-aged man named Claude, who is inseparable from his dog Merlin. They see him as \u2018a strange kind of grownup\u2019, who does as the girls tell him to. He tells them that he knew their Papa, and a relationship of shared memories is built up accordingly. Claude becomes a steady part of their lives, a constant in uncertain times. He has his own sadness to contend with, and tells the girls that he is \u2018a bit broken\u2019, but their friendship is all the more strong because of it.King\u2019s descriptions of the landscapes in The Night Rainbow are a definite strength and, like Pea\u2019s narrative voice, she has captured them perfectly. Many of these observations contain distinctly childish aspects: \u2018I try to think about the rain. It is like people clapping, as though the clouds have done something clever\u2026 or maybe the swallows have put shoes on and are dancing on our roof\u2019.Pea and Margot are two of the most realistic childish protagonists I have come across in fiction, and they are distinctly memorable in consequence. The differences in their personalities \u2013 Pea is the worrier and Margot the one who reassures, for example: \u2018Even though I am biggest she is the bravest\u2019, Pea tells us \u2013 have been balanced wonderfully. King has successfully married together the idylls of a childhood lives in the rural South of France with the realities of loss, grief and loneliness. A marvellous debut."}, {"userName": "Miki", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6101808-miki", "userReview": "This Review was first published on my blog Lecture toute une AventureMy opinion:  This is really a sweet and moving story, some parts are a little sad but as a whole it \u2018s really a great tales about the children\u2019s resources and their view of the world. It\u2019s was quite magical and I could not avoid to tear a little from time to time especially since I understood early the double meaning but it\u2019s not a book you want to give up once started. You get quickly fond of Pea and you want to see her get her happy end and without real spoiler because of the genre you do get one, probably not the one you thought at first but still one.We should never give up completely our childhood abilities because it\u2019s true that as grownup we can easily forget what is the most important. The character are well build and you do get attached to them\u2026..Claude really won me in a few pages with his kindness and merlin was for a lot in that early attachment.I\u2019m really glad to have discovered this book thanks to Lavender Library program because I probably would not have picked that book by myself and it would have been sad decision and it won me over completely. If you like sweet story, don\u2019t mind having to use some tissues and wants to remember all the magic you could see when little this is a book for you I hope you find your own night rainbow.Disclaimer: Source: a copy in exchange for an honest review in the cadre of the Lavender\u2019s Library program.

Her innocence and imagination as a 5 year old girl who just wants to make her 'Maman' smile and have happy days is beautifully expressed and has you laughing and crying at her take on the world she lives in.She gets glimpses of happy times as her Maman, suffering through her latest pregnancy, often resorts to happier times and rejoins the world but it doesnt take much to for the dark clouds to re-emerge and for Pea to take care of herself again. She finds solace by playing in nearby fields and meadows and this is where she meets Claude and his dog Merlin. Your immediate concern is why he's showing interest in Pea but it is soon strikingly obvious that he is just feeling sorry for her and becomes very protective and when you hear Claude's back story you understand his caring side. Soon other residents in the village begin to show more concern over the care of Pea , while Pea shows no real concern as she is just used to this life and loves her Maman.This is a definite must read as it's a story that sweeps you along and something that is just a little bit special!! Will be looking out for more Claire King books in the future as this is an amazing debut!"}, {"userName": "Dan (aka Utterbiblio)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5484323-dan-aka-utterbiblio", "userReview": "The Night Rainbow is a wonderfully involving novel that transports the reader to, not only the meadows of France, but also a life of isolation. Everything about Claire King\u2019s debut is questioning and desolate. The reader is left constantly pondering nuances of the melancholy world and the characters. Each member of the cast is a portrait of sadness. They each hold their burdens, none more so than the central character, Pea.Claire writes about the missing piece of people\u2019s lives with a sharp accuracy. It is the lost baby and husband that drives Pea\u2019s mother into the darkest places and the loss of her father has pushed Pea into her mind \u2013 somewhere that can be confusing for a five year old. The connection with Claude is a welcome one as he becomes a father figure for the girls. There is sweetness to their partnership as Claude builds tree houses for the girls and entertains them. In essence, Claude takes on the reader\u2019s wanted role. There is nothing we can do to shield Pea from the grown up world that is crashing down around her, but we can live through Claude.The Night Rainbow takes turns through funny, adorable and heartbreaking. This is a novel that will pull at the proverbial heartstrings and play the Funeral March on them. The bleakness is the allure, it is what grips you and takes you through the meadows, over the streams and into the heart of Pea."}, {"userName": "Alice Lippart", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart", "userReview": "A lovely book that's well written.

Het was een verdrietig en fantasierijk boek en het kindperspectief maakte het zo nu en dan extra schrijnend, maar tegelijkertijd hield dat perspectief naar mijn idee de vaart wat uit het verhaal. Het leek de schrijfster te beperken: balletjes werden opgegooid, maar konden door het perspectief van een bijna zesjarig meisje niet verder uitgelegd worden, waardoor ze niets toevoegden aan het verhaal. Daarnaast was de schrijfster soms niet in staat het perspectief realistisch te houden, waardoor de gedachten en gevolgtrekkingen niet bij het meisje Pea pasten."}, {"userName": "Belinda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45524597-belinda", "userReview": "Feel good roman met een ondertoon van het werkelijke leven. In prachtige po\u00ebtische zinnen wordt het leven op het platteland in Frankrijk beschreven. De zon brand op je huid, de stof komt van de paden, de velden vol met bloemen. Dit boek is de debuut roman van Claire King, die na haar studie economie aan Cambridge en twintig jaar in het bedrijfsleven heeft gewerkt. Daarnaast is een bekroond schrijfster van korte verhalen. Momenteel woont ze in Zuid-Frankrijk, in de Langedoc Ruissillon met haar man en twee kinderen. Het kennen van het leven in Frankrijk spreekt uit de zinnen in deze roman.De cover laat je de regenboog zien, de boog van hoop met een enkel meisje op een schommel, alleen. De achterflap laat je heel nieuwsgierig achter. Wat gaat er in dit boek gebeuren? Pea en haar \"zusje\"Margot hebben hun vader verloren. Hij kwam onder de tractor, het was een ongeluk. Voor hun moeder was dit de volgende tragedie. Ze kan dit niet goed verwerken en is wel \"chagarijnig\". Verder heeft ze een nieuwe baby in haar buik en kan daardoor moeilijk moeder zijn voor hun totdat het baby'tje uit het deurtje komt zoals Margot zegt.Ze gaan niet naar school en proberen er met hun kinderlijk begrip en fantasie wat van te maken. Tijdens een spelletje in het veld leren ze Claude kennen, en zijn hond Merlin. Hij woont in de buurt en er ontstaat en vriendschap tussen de kinderen en Claude.Daarnaast breekt Pea haar hoofd waar ze toch een nieuwe Papa kan vinden want die is gezellig en doet leuke dingen met hun en helpt Maman. Ondanks dat Pea heel wat te verstouwen heeft is de veerkracht wat de boventoon voert.Ze probeert elke dag weer een strategie te bedenken waardoor ze haar Maman aan het lachen krijgt.Maar gedurende de pagina's duren wordt ik wel wat kwaad op deze Maman. Dat ze zo blind is dat ze niet ziet dat ze nog een kind heeft. Dat ze nog steeds de landstaal niet goed spreekt waardoor ze een eenling blijft in het dorp en waardoor ook haar kind een eenling blijft. De verschil van houding van Claude en Maman, hoe ze een tragedie verwerken en een plaats in hun leven geven is enorm.Er zijn tijdens deze feel good leesclub meerdere keren opmerkingen gemaakt als Pea is vroeg wijs en Margot nog meer. Hoe weten ze bepaalde woorden en hebben ze wijsheid? Voor mij was het geen vraag maar een gegeven. Ten eerste heeft Pea enorm veel meegemaakt en heeft ze al een tijdje voor zichzelf moeten zorgen. Daar wordt je wel vroegwijs van. Ten tweede is Pea bijna 6, Ten derde zou ze ook een hoogbegaafd kind kunnen zijn. Maar eigenlijk maken deze opmerkingen niets uit. De schrijfster heeft dichterlijke vrijheid aangaande het cre\u00ebren van een personage en ik ben weg van Pea. Ik zou haar wel willen knuffelen. cover: 9sluit goed aan bij het boek.karakters: 9 in ieder hoofdstuk komt van elk hoofdpersonages meer naar boven.

Their beloved Papa has died in a tragic accident, and Maman is exhausted with grief and with the extra exertion that comes in a woman\u2019s final few months of pregnancy. The girls do everything possible to help their mother \u2013 stay out of the house, clean up, make meals, and take care of themselves while Maman sleeps \u2013 but her despair seems to grow. Rescue from their own growing despondency comes in the form of a mysterious man. He looks scary but is not and soon provides them the love and friendship they so desperately crave \u2013 not to mention nourishment and supervision. However, Claude has his own secrets, and others do not take quite as kindly to his help as Pea and Margot do. As Maman nears the end of her pregnancy, the girls find themselves immersed in an adult feud that they not only cannot understand but which frightens them. Claire King\u2019s The Night Rainbow explores the girls\u2019 search for happiness and understanding in a world left bereft after Papa\u2019s death and Maman\u2019s ongoing depression.The synopsis of The Night Rainbow sounds incredibly depressing, but the story itself is surprisingly upbeat and cheerful. Pea is a delightful narrator. Her narrative is simple and age-appropriate, as she shares Margot\u2019s and her thought processes on how they can help Maman feel good enough to get out of bed and take care of them. At age five, her grasp of the adult side of things is severely limited, yet her observation skills are excellent and she shares more with a reader than she realizes or comprehends. The childish sense of hope and faith never wavers even through Pea\u2019s darker moments, making this very tragic story something wonderful to experience.Ms. King\u2019s prose is absolutely gorgeous. She captures the spectacular setting with clear and precise descriptions that evoke all five senses, but she does so in such a way that makes it obvious that the descriptions are from Pea\u2019s viewpoint. She imbues the most innocuous things with a twinge of fear while she styles other things, that which adults might find uncomfortable, with wonder and astonishment. This not only confirms Pea\u2019s place in the story but adds a large-than-life element to the entire setting that fits perfectly with the story at large.The Night Rainbow is not flashy nor is it all that exciting. It is, however, an excellent study about the grieving process and an absolutely beautiful story about the preciousness of a child\u2019s unwavering love and loyalty. The plot reveals itself slowly, in delicate layers that enhance the emotional upheaval Pea feels throughout the story. Speaking of Pea, she charms readers with her childhood innocence and desperate yearning. As each puzzle pieces fall into place, readers get the chance to understand everything that Pea cannot and the full picture is truly agonizing in its depths. Yet, Pea\u2019s dogged optimism in light of the ongoing tragedy makes her the type of child character with whom readers fall in love and The Night Rainbow the type of novel that will haunt readers long after finishing it."}, {"userName": "Juvariyya  Yousuf", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3958452-juvariyya-yousuf", "userReview": "\"You can't mend everything that gets broken.\" Its one of the best birthday present I could ever ask for.

Our choosing began when Maman came back from hospital last year. She had changed from fat to thin, but she didn\u2019t bring back a baby like she promised. She left it at the hospital, along with her happiness\u201d.This is a beautifully written and poignant story and I totally fell in love with Pea. When the story begins we are introduced to the narrator, 5 year old Pea (aka Peony) and her 4 year old sister Margot. Pea has a much older voice for her years and longs to make her mother happy again but nothing seems to make her mother smile. Her mother has suffered a double loss - first her baby and then her partner in a tragic accident and her grief is evident. As a result, Pea and Margot are left to their own devices most of the time and Maman takes no more than a cursory interest in where they go or what they do. Their mother is pregnant again with their late father\u2019s baby and she hardly has the energy or the will to look after herself, let alone Pea and Margot. During one of their games in the meadow, they meet Claude, an older man and his dog Merlin. Claude is treated with suspicion by some of the villagers and seems to be as sad and lonely as they are and as the story progresses, we find out the reason for Claude\u2019s sadness. Pea thinks a new daddy will make her Maman happy however is Claude that person? Claude tries to make things better for them and builds a tree house in which he places biscuits and drinks for them to find. The trust and innocence in Pea\u2019s nature is very evident throughout and the reader sees life through Pea\u2019s eyes - she doesn\u2019t understand why Claude won\u2019t give her a hug or why their grandmother doesn\u2019t seem to like them. 4 year old Margot is very much the bossy one, again with a much older voice than a 4 year old would have. Pea has such a vivid imagination, always inventing stories and games for them to play and it was only when I was halfway through the book that I realised that the story had a deeper meaning.I really enjoyed this book, there is a wonderful sense of place and I could actually imagine myself in the French countryside along with Pea and Margot. There were times when I could have cried for Pea - when there was no food, or clean clothes and at times the girls\u2019 innocent observations made me smile. This a wonderful debut novel and I look forward to reading more by this author."}], "description": "It is summer in the south of France, and Pea and her little sister Margot spend their days running free and inventing games in the meadow behind their house. But Pea is burdened with worries beyond her five and a half years. Her father has died in an accident, and her mother has just lost a baby. Maman is English, isolated in this small, foreign village, and in her sadness has retreated even further. Pea tries her best to help, makes Margot behave, brings home yellow flowers, but she can't make Maman happy again. When Pea meets Claude, a man with a dog who seems to love the meadow as she does, she believes that she and Margot have found a friend, and maybe even a new Papa. But why do the villagers view Claude with suspicion and what secret is he keeping in his strange, empty house? Beautifully written, haunting and full of surprises, The Night Rainbow is a novel about innocence and experience, grief and compassion, and the blessings and perils of imagination and truth.", "title": "The Night Rainbow", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15834626.The_Night_Rainbow", "average": 3.84, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1358095612l/15834626.jpg", "reviews": 345, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6427443.Claire_King", "name": "Claire  King"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mental Health"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15834626-the-night-rainbow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15715592-the-night-rainbow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17661408-the-night-rainbow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26157081-een-regenboog-in-de-nacht", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17970243-the-night-rainbow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27779339-everything-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24685883-wine-at-breakfast", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10153841-a-metazen-christmas"]}
