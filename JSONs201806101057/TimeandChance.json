Which is not true at all. There is no time travel. Only the ability to swap lives in parallel universes/alternate history. Luckily, I found these concepts far more intriguing than time travel. Because I have always been a \"What if?\" thinker, regretting choices I have made, from life changing ones like marrying or not, to miniscule ones like buying Frosted Flashes instead of Golden Grahams. I am the first to admit how ridiculous this sounds, silly and futile. After all, wiring, like a rocking chair, will give you something to do, but will get you nowhere . But, alas, a lifelong overanalyzed, I cannot seem to help myself. The nights I waste, obsessing.... Rick and Richard. 35 years old, they each made to drastically different decisions at a crossroads 13 years ago. Rick decides to stay in his hometown, the small suburb of Appleton, New Hampshire- where everyone knows everyone else's business- to marry his high school sweetheart. Debra. They have two kids. Following in his footsteps, his daughter is perusing her passion for theater and has been cast as Juliet in her school's production of Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\". Bitter for giving up his dream of moving to New York in favor of family life, he finds in difficult to compliment or support her. Over the years, his marriage and devotion to Debra has waned. He has become so angry that on the night he meets Richard, he has hit his daughter for the first time. Divorce seems imminent. Richard, on the other hand, pursued his dream to make it big in theater. Giving up marriage to Debra, he still loves you very much today, he moves to New York. His romantic relationship since then have been tumultuous and unfulfilling at best- most notably represented by a marriage to a cocaine-addicted, selfish ex-wife. Professionally, he had done well for himself, performing with for the most well-respected actors in the industry. He has a close friend in his agent, and friends that love him. Although not as angry as Rick, he does greatly regret his choice 13 years ago. When the two meet, there is little hesitation for them to change lives. By the end of their time in the parallel universes, if nothing else, both have learned a great deal about themselves. The opportunity comes for them to switch back into their original lives, but greatly altered. In some ways for the better, in others for the worse. What will they choose? I would kill to have the opportunity to do this, to experience a what-if parallel universe. I wish I could say that I am confident that I would choose to return to my life today, because it seems like cheating to switch lives. But, if I am honest with myself right now (and openly exposing myself to vulnerability), I am not happy with so many things in my life. I suppose I could experience the same thing Richard and Rick did, the well evidenced \"grass is greener on the other side\" effect, but I am pretty sure that this will not be the case with me. Without going into too many details, I am very depressed, as a result of some mental health issues that very likely would be alleviated had I taken a different turn at a crossroads many years ago. And things could not be too much worse than they are now. Alas, this was science fiction and therefore a fantasy for me. Not to end this on such a depressing note, there is always hope that I will eventually be given enough new crossroads in life that I will no longer feel this painful regret. **** Spoilers **** Both of them choose to return to their original lives, although less immediately certain than the first time they switched. Good for them. I would have done the same. What they each learned through their experiences made both of them better prepared and more appreciative to continue their lives."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3620323-sarah", "userReview": "Time and Chance is about the journey rather than the destination. It\u2019s a book filled with conflict, love, tenderness and confusion all propped up by an intense emotional thread that seems to compliment the book well, without ever being overdone. If, at points, the plot did seem to lag, it does pick up and recover, especially during the last third of the book. Time and Chance is an impressive character study, which manages to hook the reader while also forcing them to examine their own lives, and choices.Read my full review here: http://bookwormblues.blogspot.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/590610-margaret", "userReview": "One man who becomes two men, Rick and Richard, take 2 paths 13 years before.

I found it to be an interesting exploration of both alternative universes and second chances, with a good dose of circumstances and consequences tossed in. I do not think it a great book, but it is an interesting read.Richard Cochrane is thirty-five, and has one divorce and several failed relationships behind him, and no children. He grew up in Appleton, New Hampshire, but broke up with his pregnant girlfriend thirteen years ago to seek his fame and fortune as an actor in New York City, and has been quite successful in doing so, but regrets never having a family. Rick Cochrane is thirty-five, married, with two children. Thirteen years ago he gave up his dream of acting and married his pregnant girlfriend, remaining in his home town of Appleton, New Hampshire, and working at an insurance company. If these two men sound similar, it is because they are the same man, in different universes that are running concurrently; one in which he became New York Richard, and one in which he became Small-Town Rick, with the split occurring with his decision to leave / stay with his pregnant girlfriend thirteen years ago.The two men meet at a joint crux point: Richard has come home to Appleton to bury his widowed mother, and Rick is deeply angry at his job, his marriage, and his life. The two men figure that their universes have converged for a reason, and after some discussion, New York Richard steps into life in the Small Town with Rick\u2019s family, and Small Town Rick steps into the acting world of New York Richard. Most of the book alternates between the two characters, exploring how they cope and manage (or not) in the different universes they now inhabit.I found this book quite interesting; at its heart are themes of second chances, of seeking one\u2019s dreams, and of dealing with the consequences of actions or inactions. I did not find it a great book, but I think it will be a good book to discuss at our book club meeting tomorrow night."}, {"userName": "Missy J", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j", "userReview": "I read this book, because I wanted to read a book written by Alan Brennert. His book \"Molokai\" has been highly praised, unfortunately the public library in my area, doesn't have this book in its shelves. So I opted to read another book by this author, namely \"Time and Chance\". This book was written before \"Molokai\", so my disappointment isn't too great. His writing could've only gotten better since \"Time and Chance\".The story sounds interesting; the protagonist could've lived two different lives: either choose to move to New York and become a Broadway star (acting is his passion) or marry his college-sweetheart (whom he also got pregnant), raise a family and work a daytime job in an office. Both end up not really satisfied with their lives, and the chance to live the other \"if only\"-life seems like an excellent solution to their problems. However, I thought the story was a bit cheesy and overall, too unrealistic, that I didn't enjoy reading it. The only thing which was fairly interesting was the description of how a play gets started from scratch before hitting the stage. That was written very passionately and I could understand it: on the one side, putting all your effort to the play, bringing yourself to be the role you have to play, stage production, make up, etc. and on the other side, the feeling of loneliness which comes, after the very last show, and deprivation, when parting with your co-workers with whom you had to work to create something to meaningful to you.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Unless you're interested in the plot, but the story lacks something, something that will surprise the reader.I can only pray \"Molokai\" is better than this."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/598210-sue", "userReview": "This is an earlier work by Alan Brennert, the same author of my current FAVORITE book, Moloka'i. This is the sole reason I bought the book. Halfway through it, I was ready to give it only 2 stars. It had an interesting premise (a semi-famous actor switches places with his alter-ego who opted to marry his high school sweetheart instead of pursuing acting), but it just wasn't keeping my interest as the two men sorted through each other's lives. But the last third of the book picked up, and I found myself \"pulled in\". So, I upped the rating to 3 stars. I think Alan Brennert is a very talented writer. I'm hoping he writes something else soon."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/563372-susan", "userReview": "Really great book on second chances and dealing with your life choices.

(But it's on my to-read list now). I'm just saying that up front to let you know I have no comparison books. But I really enjoyed Time and Chance. The book literally showed up on a table all by itself where I work. As I was reading the back page, someone compared it to Time and Again by Jack Finney. That was all I needed, because if you haven't read Time and Again, go get it right now and leave yourself a couple of days to read it straight through.Back to Time and Chance: It has an intriguing hook. The main characters, Rick and Richard, are really the same person, but he came to a diverging path in his life after college and took the one that stayed in his hometown and married his pregnant girlfriend. Brennert then introduces us to Richard who took the other path -- he moved to New York City for the theater and left his girlfriend behind. Now, twenty years later, neither is happy and they both look with regret at their choices. As Richard returns to his hometown for his mother's funeral, the two meet and change lives. It's not a perfect book and several reviewers complained that they had to suspend belief. Well, yes. It's a novel that plays with time. (I stayed up all night to finish it.) But that said, much of this book has stayed with me. What it said to me is that yes, we all have regrets, but when we live our lives in the present and take responsibility for our choices and actions, we are better for it. There are consequences for every action, and we need to take bad with good and not blame, not accuse, not wallow in self-pity or guilt. Don't look back with longing because there is no perfect life in this imperfect world, and the sooner we understand that, the happier and more well-adjusted we will be... Of course, all that is not said in the novel; it isn't preachy at all. But we get to live out Rick and Richard's second chances and discover with them, that our choices make us who we are, and when we learn that, it's all good."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19643693-karen", "userReview": "3.5.

It was about just that, a person who was neither male nor female. It was a story about love, identity, and relationships, and it lingered with me long after I finished the story. I had actually been exposed to Brennert before then through Weird Romance, which featured another of his stories, but this was the first fiction of his I read, and from that moment forward, I knew he was a writer to read.Fast forward a few years, when I chance upon a historical novel he wrote about a leper colony on Hawaii called Moloka'i. I took a chance on it, since I knew Brennert could evoke complex emotion in a short story, even though it didn't sound like my kind of story. It's still one of only two books that made me cry (the other being The Book Thief), and if I hadn't already made a mental note to read everything this author writes, Moloka'i would have done it.Time and Chance is an earlier novel of Brennert's, though it still has that emotional resonance I've associated with his previous works. It's about a man named Richard Cochrane who, thirteen years ago, made a decision to give up the woman he loved in order to go to New York to become an actor. It's also about a man named Richard Cochrane who, thirteen years ago, made a decision to give up on his dreams to become an actor in order to stay with the woman he loved to raise a family. Neither Richard is entirely happy with his decision and the life he's led since then, but time and chance have somehow conspired to allow them to swap places. The story is how they adapt to their new, alternate lives.What I really liked about this novel is how Brennert took one character and made two characters out of him. Each have the same backstory, the same histories. Their divergence allowed him to examine their lives in different ways, and see how it affected them in their later years. He doesn't make it easy for either Richard to step into the other's life, which is as it should be. Thirteen years after making a difficult decision affects one's personality. The bitter, angry man who resents having given up a chance to become an actor isn't the same person as the melancholy, morose man who regrets having given up a chance at a family. Each character has a challenge stepping into the other's shoes, but Brennert does make it easier for one than the other.Brennert's talent is in his people, and their relationships. I've noticed also that in many of his stories -- \"The Third Sex\", Her Pilgrim Soul (as much as I know about it from Weird Romance, at least), and Time and Chance, at least -- he features a troubled relationship, and the ways that those relationships can mend. They're very hopeful affairs, which is a nice antidote to the other kinds of fiction I often read.Alan Brennert is a treat, and a gem. I haven't read anything of his that I wouldn't recommend without hesitation."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5468342-pam", "userReview": "I am very accustomed to reading young adult novels. This was not a young adult novel. This was very adult and I am not entirely comfortable with what I just read.So what did I think about this book? Well, the premise of this book is that there are two entities, one man, living parallel lives. It is supposed to be a \"what-if\" scenario. What if you had made a different choice after college and married the woman you loved and gave up your acting career? What if Debra had never aborted Paige? What if Richard lived the life of Rick? Would they destroy each others lives or build them?At the start, I thought Rick and Richard were assholes, lost in the choices they chose. Then there is static into the alternate lives that they could be living. Then Rick and Richard meet and switch identities while actually being the same person, but with different memories.I marked this 2/5 stars and not a 1 because I will never re-read this book, but I thought Alan Brennert was a great writer.

It takes the idea that when we make those pivotal moments in our lives...perhaps the moments that we replay what if over and over and over again...in another reality you actually make that other choice and your life plays out from there. What happens if your two selves from those two separate decisions (but one deciding event) meet. That is what happens in this book. When I read the blurb, I was actually expecting a time travel book. It was more freaky Friday than time travel, but was utterly captivating to me. (I read the book throughout one long day of travel in the airport and on the plane.). It was interesting to see two lives that ended up so different with both so incomplete. Who I liked one version of Richard and despised the other one, yet wanted both of them to succeed in their journeys. I half expected it to end with the two selves coming back together into one self....but it didn't and I'm glad it didn't.
