My dad, always an avid reader, loves to read westerns and only westerns. So you can imagine the shock my dad had when he realized that I loved horror and treated westerns like the clap; I not only avoid the disease, but anyone who looks like they might be a carrier. See, my dad never got it. He never understood that underneath all that blood, guts, and gore was a story. Well, after receiving Steve Vernon's Long Horn, Big Shaggy, I admit I was a little bit hesitant, but like the good little reviewer that I am, I decided to give it a chance; a chance that, looking back, should have been given to another reviewer. Rather than start with a little dipping of the feet and legs, I was pushed head first into a twisted western without even a lifejacket. The pace takes off at full speed and never lets up. The atmosphere is almost exactly what you'd expect from a black and white western, just enough to let you know where you're supposed to be. Filled to the brim with analogies, slang, and more similes than I can count, Vernon\u2019s style of writing is truly unique; bizarre and strange, but unique. To add flavor to that 'special' style is the sentence structure, or for a better choice of words, the lack of it. There are periods out of place, commas in the wrong spots, and breaks in paragraphs that are just downright unnatural. But I have to say, after the first few pages, it stopped grating on me and became like background noise. Either Vernon was incredibly bold and worked a little literary magic with his audacious typographical risks or he and his editor got very, very lucky. Whichever the case, the odd grammatical texture of the work added to the overall dementia Vernon created. Is it a Western genre thing? I'm just not sure, and my Dad won't give me a straight answer. The characters that Vernon creates are as extreme as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid. You'll remember them, not because they are complex and thought out, but because they are so off-the-wall. So I ask you, is it a western thing? Are all those cowboy films just about a group of shallow stereotypes that, while they aren\u2019t interesting, you just can\u2019t help to remember? Vernon\u2019s players are incoherent and one-dimensional, but will stick with you for days, maybe even weeks. In this cast alone, he has the token Native American Spirit, the all-guts-and-no-brains cowboy, and we can\u2019t forget the vengeful Native American zombie head. Yes, you read that right, I said zombie head. Bet you weren't expecting that, were you? Yeah, me neither. See and that is how Vernon kept me reading. He mutates what you\u2019ve come to expect into something from The Outer Limits. Good job! If you\u2019re into saddles and spurs, then this is unique enough to make the ride a fun one and probably worth 4 stars. Unfortunately, for me, westerns are a thing of the past and best left dead. I give it 2 stars. That rounds out to a nice, shaky three, and at only $10.00 well worth the price of admission for your Saturday western matinee. -As reviewed for Horror-Web.com"}, {"userName": "Keith Blackmore", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4383787-keith-blackmore", "userReview": "This is my first Steve Vernon story, and I finished it thinking \"What did I just read?\"But I know I liked it.I'm no reviewer, but I know what clicks. In this weird west tale of undead buffalo hunters, gunslingers, crawling skulls and floating spirits, I found myself either smiling or chuckling my butt off at not only the situation and the imagery Steve's concocted in here, but the prose that binds it all together. If this story was in paper, it'd be paper bound in buffalo leather, left in the shiniest spittoon, and marinated in the tobacco juice of the earth.With peyote sprinkles.See, I don't know what I meant by that either, but here's a whole story full of lines like that, and imagery enough to sit back and just marvel at it all. I think the last writer to make me pause like this was Annie Proulx.If you grew up with weird war tales, or just strangeness in general, try this novella. If you like a story full of brilliant imagery, told with a voice that rings as clear and distinctive as frozen prairie oysters, then try this novella. If you like mammoth ear wax... *try* this novella.Still not knowing if you should buy it?You got more questions than a barrel full of wonder..."}, {"userName": "Don Richardson", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4483995-don-richardson", "userReview": "If you've ever wanted to read a zombie Western, this is a good one. The storytelling is fast-paced, the dialog is hilarious. I actually couldn't put it down. I would have rated it higher than 3 stars, except that I thought the characters could have used a bit more development, parts of the plot seemed a little contrived, and I wasn't entirely satisfied with the ending. Be that as it may, it is still a fun read. I laughed out loud several times!"}, {"userName": "John Copeland", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21309887-john-copeland", "userReview": "Started off amazing. Laugh out loud funny at times. Steve Vernon clearly has a great way with words. Unfortunately, the novella takes a dive after the half way mark and becomes a rather boring mess by the end."}], "description": "There's things out there that you ain't dreamt of. Like back-from-the-dead mountain men, green ghost rock spirits, carrion stallions, time-travelling mad scientists and zombified buffalo for starters. \"The bullet chunked into the meat of Jonah Walker's dust gray horse long before he heard the shot.\" And that's just the opening line of a bonecreaking romp through an antique fun house. A wild western horror novella that starts at a gallop, and gathers momentum faster than a stampeding avalanche.
