Boatwright, an American author, entranced me with her cozy mystery novel, Under an English Heaven: An Ellie Kent Mystery , that will keep you guessing through the pages as the main protagonist Ellie searches for the truth behind the murder of a mysterious man.Synopsis: When Ellie Kent moves to an English village with her new husband Graham, she fears the villagers will always see her as that young American who snared their attractive vicar during his sabbatical in California. But this challenge is nothing compared to what happens when she stumbles across a body in the churchyard. The villagers insist they don't know the murdered man, so suspicion mounts that the killer must be the incomer - the vicar's new wife. As evidence piles up against her, Ellie tries to stay one step ahead of the police to unravel a decades-old literary mystery and love story. Will others die before she can solve it? And what will be left of her new life and marriage, even if she succeeds? Ellie Kent is modern and independent woman who in her other life was a literature professor in the US, but in her present she is married to an alluring English vicar in an old English village. From her dressing style to talking style, everything is in contrast with the people of the English Cotswolds. But when people discovered a body of a mysterious on her backyard, it was not hard for them to put their fingers on! But, Ellie is on a mission to clear her name as well as to find the identity of this mysterious man, thus stumbling upon some forgotten love-affairs as well as her own darkest secrets.I know many people don't prefer cozy mysteries, even I too fall into that category, since the mysteries are not that thrilling/intriguing enough to keep me guessing till the end! But Boatwright's new book simply changed my perspective about cozy mysteries, I read quite a few cozy mysteries, and I have to say this that Alice K. Boatwright is one hell of a rare gem in the world of cozy mystery writers. Her writing style is absolutely fabulous, though the book opened in a slow pace, as the author was building her characters in the beginning of her book. But her plot is really mind-blowing, it was one hell of a thrilling roller coaster ride for me.The author's protagonist, Elli may project herself as someone who is bold and loves to follow trends that are either considered as too modern or forward. And the way Ellie lighted up the dark road to an unraveling mystery is simply striking enough and with the author's intricate detailed layering of the mystery, it felt really nice and brilliant to read the story. The rest of the characters are equally bright and colorful and terribly English! Their quirkiness made the story more interesting to read.Moreover, the way the story progressed is simply scintillating, and the author unraveled her mystery one layer at a time. But the plot had its own flaws, at times I felt the tightly wrapped mystery was falling short and I could guess away the killer quite easily. Well, if you enjoy a good cozy mystery, then go for this!Verdict:  Cozy stories are always meant to be read under a cozy blanket with a hot mug of coffee in a lazy Saturday afternoon! Courtesy:  I'm really grateful to the author, Alice K. Boatwright, for giving me an opportunity to read and review her book."}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/841949-tracey", "userReview": "Which is a great title, isn't it? Of course I bought it.Unfortunately, I hated it.No, that's not accurate; it really wasn't bad, in terms of writing or all the usual reasons a book is bad. I liked some of the writing \u2013 the description of the burning of the Guy was vivid, for example. I didn't *hate* it. I just really, really didn't like it. At all.The idea is this: an English vicar, Graham, goes on sabbatical in California, comes home married; his first wife died a little while ago. New American wife, Ellie, formerly a college English professor, must now adapt to trying to live up to the memory of the beloved dead wife, drinking tea, filling the role of Vicar's Wife, and driving on the left. Meanwhile, on Halloween, an old man is murdered, and Ellie finds the body in the graveyard, and through a series of unlikely yet believable events becomes a person of great interest to the police.Given that the book opens a few months after the wedding, when they've moved together into the home Graham formerly shared with Wife #1, I have all sorts of problems with that summary. How long have they in fact been married? Don't know. How long ago did they move in? I don't know. How long has the first wife been dead? I don't know. If I was told any of this in the text (and I admit it possibly was without my registering it) I didn't retain the information, and afterward I had no interest in going hunting. I should know. They're kind of important pieces of information; it all plays a big part in how I'm supposed to feel about Graham, and how the villagers can be expected to look at Ellie. She's gone for years? Okay, he's still young (I assume \u2013 I don't know), good for him. She's gone for months? I hope he's dead by the end of the book. Next, the daughter: how old is she? I don't know. She's away at school for most of the book \u2013 but that could be any age above say six. Contextually she seems to be a teenager or older \u2013 say thirteen or up. Again, I should know. It matters.Even the description of the girl refuses to give her age \u2013 or coloration, or anything else useful: \"Isabelle was not as tall as Ellie, but nearly, and, as they hugged, her bones felt fragile and light beneath the skimpy clothes she wore: a cropped sweater and skintight jeans. She had Louise's beautiful fine features and clear fresh complexion, but Graham's lankiness and shining intelligent eyes.\" Thanks, that's marvelous. It's well put \u2013 but \u2026This is a cozy sort of a mystery \u2013 in that it takes place in a sweet English village, and the vicar's wife investigates the death of an old man who seems to be unknown and unimportant to anyone in the place. This should mean that one of the main reasons to read it would be the characters. Unfortunately, for me they were the worst part of the book. Graham, the vicar, is a nonentity. I can't imagine why Ellie would marry him; he's introduced naked, so perhaps the author thought that would be a shortcut to explaining the attraction: \"Look, they just had sex! He must be worth giving up everything for!\" But he fades into the wallpaper, even naked \u2013 except when he is being an ass. That observation comprises quite a few of the notes I made on the Kindle, just a one-word comment on some of his actions (like showing signs of believing his new wife could be a murderer): \"ass\". There is an incident with a bouquet of flowers relating to the anniversary of the first wife's death, which Ellie mistook as being for her, and that was just altogether moronic, pointless, and annoying.The rest of the villagers are an unpleasant lot; the children are hooligans, and the adults are snide or standoffish, except for another \"incomer\", a gay shopowner who strikes up a friendship with Ellie. Well, after a while it starts to morph into friendship; it starts out with him making snide or outright insulting remarks and taking his dead ex-partner's golden retriever everywhere, including church. (Really?)The police are just antisocial thugs. I don't know what to think about them.I don't want to think too much about the silly bint who names her child \"Dolphin\".And Ellie, Our Heroine? You know how most of my comments about his vicarness amounted to \"ass\"? Most of my comments about Ellie amounted to \"bitch\". The reader is expected to believe that she was a professor of English literature, specializing in Jane Austen apparently, when she met Graham, fell in love, and dropped her entire life to move across the ocean to become the vicar's wife of a smallish village. What I would expect would be something like clear evidence of a huge and overwhelming love between the two of them, which would explain the vicar's sudden emergence from grieving his beloved first wife as well as Ellie's willingness to abruptly cut loose from family, friends, career, country. Continent. I would also expect something from Ellie along the lines of \"I've been reading about England all my life now OMG I'm living here hey this isn't Jane Austen's England\"\u2026 I would expect her to be one of the most sympathetic characters I've read in a long time, with her study of the role of gossip in the novels of Jane Austen.Instead, there is nothing about Ellie's decision to cut all her ties and relocate. She seems thoroughly unwilling to do anything expected of her as a vicar's wife, and indeed comes off as thoroughly heartless, warbling Beatles songs in the car as she drives (probably on the wrong side of the road) to the home of a family that has just lost a child. There is nothing about giving up her career (of how many years, I don't know \u2013 how old is *she* supposed to be, anyway?), or leaving family and friends \u2013 except that she seems to be avoiding their emails (scrolling past \"urgent messages\" \u2013 really? REALLY??); why? I don't know. (And why doesn't anyone call her?) How does she feel about becoming a step-mother to an-I-don't-know-how-old girl, other than awkward? I don't know. All I know is she hates driving or even riding in a car on the left side of the road, and occasionally mourns her former diet of tofu and such.For the matter of that, what color is her hair? I don't know. Eyes? Don't know. Age range? Don't know. (This, by the way, all goes for every character in the book. While sometimes descriptions can get irritating, a complete lack of description is worse. For the most part there is only a pr\u00e9cis of what someone is wearing, and maybe a general impression.) Siblings? Don't know. Best friend from home? Don't know. Dogs or cats? Hopefully dogs since her husband has one, but \u2013 don't know. (Although she looks askance at a golden retriever, and without reason asks if it is \"in the habit of attacking people\", so she doesn't sound like a dog person.) She meanders into her new life with a combination of resentfulness and extreme sensitivity on the subject of her predecessor (and no help at all from hubby there)(at all), condescending distaste for the habits and customs and beef stew of the people by who she is now surrounded and a near-complete lack of real willingness to make an effort, and a general air of \"I am so much smarter than all of you, and I eat tofu, and I can't believe you people believe in God \u2013 I'm American, get over it and get stuffed.\" Which isn't, I wouldn't think, a good attitude to take with the cops.And defensive and touchy as she is over being questioned by the police, it never occurs to her to make sure a lawyer is at her side.\"Nothing in her marriage vows had mentioned baking!\"My note \u2013 and you can tell it's deeply annoyed, given the length when I had to hunt and peck: \"for god's sake any idiot can make cookies and if you don't want to then damn well don't and smile and tell the old bats so\".Her scholarship is \u2026 frankly ridiculous. \"Her whole career had been focused on prising out information about who writers were from what they wrote\" \u2013 which is how all those people get tangled up about whether a certain playwright actually wrote what he wrote. Speaking of whom: \"'All the world's a stage,' she thought, was clearly written by someone who had lived in an English village.\" Yes, clever clogs. In Stratford. What a startling observation by an English lit professor. Honestly, I found her intelligence questionable: \"Graham said it never worked to pray for results. You had to pray for acceptance of the results, whatever they were. Ellie could not understand that. What kind of magic was that?\"Er\u2026 magic and faith: actually not the same thing.\"It wasn't her fault that she didn't fit in and probably never would. She had tried.\"Did not.And her jealousy is horrendous. She's jealous of Dead First Wife, jealous of step-daughter Isabelle's relationship with Graham (since she herself has a less than great relationship with her own father, and because he has the temerity to want to spend time with her). It's all at a level that one might expect in a gothic novel.The writing was better than some \u2026 but then again it wasn't always. There is a eulogy that made my toes curl, and not in a good way. Then there were things like \"'I don't know why these old girls are so attached to scatter rugs. I mean the name says it all, don't it?'\" No\u2026 if you mean they're slippery, no, it doesn't.It's a little sad that up till late in the book I was rooting for a solution that amounted to Graham dead and Ellie standing over him red-handed, having previously killed the other victims in the village as well as a string of others back in the States. Oh well. And it's a shame; there are moments here that I really did like: that unlikely confluence of data and events that makes the police give Ellie some very hard looks was pretty well done, and her fear and horror at how things were falling apart was done pretty well \u2013 in the beginning, until it turned into \"dammit, I'm from the home of NYPD Blue and CSI, I'm not afraid of you, you're stupid\". I actually liked her difficulties with the whole left-side-of-the-road thing; it can't be easy and it can't be fun. But she was so overall horrible that I would have been delighted to see her arrested \u2013 or maybe the final murder victim. That would have worked too."}, {"userName": "Chip Noon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3360035-chip-noon", "userReview": "Under an English Heaven is one of the most delightful whodunits I've ever read.

I liked the interesting contrast provided by the American in the story, who is the key character and the one through whose eyes we see the story unfold.The story was a little slow to get going but we are compensated by an easy writing style that zooms in on every scene and leaves us in no doubt where we are at any given time, and a sense that this is just the tranquility before the storm to come.As murder mysteries go, this is a gentle one.

Read this to get in the mood for visiting the Cotswalds. This is a shining example of a cozy mystery. The book feels like it is probably from a small press, which means that it's not quite as... processed as the ones from larger publishers. This means that the mystery is perhaps a bit clunkier than average, but there are also interesting observations by the author that might have been edited out of a more thoroughly worked-over manuscript. All in all, I liked it and would highly recommend it if you need some soothing.Ellie Kent is the new vicar's wife in Little Beecham, a small Cotswald village. I confess that the vicar's wife thing almost kept me from opening the book at all- I don't care for that sort of cozy. But Ellie is a former professor of literature (Jane Austen, natch) and the former wife of a poet. She's more comfortable in her \"New York armor\" of all black than in a vicar's wife's church tweeds. And her literature degree and skill in analysis actually comes in handy in a logical way in the story! Ellie is trying to figure out how she fits into village life and still hold onto her self. A murder which pulls her in as a possible suspect does not help her at all with this goal, but it does show that she can be plucky and independent. Her husband isn't too much of a goober, and Ellie begins to make friends with characters that I'd like to see again. I'd also love to see Little Beecham- the author writes lovely description of just what I hope to see when I get to visit the English countryside. The book is a quick read. I was actually hoping for a bit that the murderer was going to be someone other than who it turned out to be- that would have been more interesting in my opinion, because the murderer really showed no redeeming qualities whatsoever and that was a bit boring. Read to enjoy spending time with Ellie in front of the Aga while rain patters on the vicarage windows, not for the tricky puzzle. It was my cup of tea, I guess, because I just bought the second book in the series for that rainy day when I need some comforting myself."}, {"userName": "Yukari Watanabe", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2057405-yukari-watanabe", "userReview": "I usually love this kind of cozy mystery in a small English village, but I didn't love this one.Main reasons are characters. In cozy mysteries, characters are very important. The characters Boatwright created are not multi-dimensional and uninteresting including villains. But, the worst ones are the 2 main characters. I didn't understand why Ellie left a busy life as a college professor in California to become a vicar's wife (despite the fact she was a nonbeliever) in a small English village. Graham doesn't seem to be attractive or sympathetic enough for Ellie to give up her independence. At least I was not convinced. What baffled me the most was that Ellie never talked about the dilemma. She even apologized for having made \"such a mess of things\" and being \"farther than ever from being your Mrs. Vicar\". If this is how the protagonist thinks, I'm not interested in this series.

If I enjoy a book for what it is, I give it four stars. If I really enjoy it, I give it five. I really enjoyed this book, and it scratched the \"cozy mystery set in an English village, preferably featuring a vicar and/or his family\" itch I've been having. (I know, I have very specific reading itches.) The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that I'm also not one of those people who tries to figure out whodunnit, at least not more than idly guessing, yet I had this one figured out immediately. So I figure it wasn't a terribly clever mystery--although there was one shock--and I knocked off a star. It was still an almost perfect cozy mystery and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series. I just prefer to be surprised by a mystery. This is the same reason I was disappointed by The Sixth Sense, whose surprising ending I figured out before I even saw the movie, just from reading that there was a \"shocking twist.\"Oh, the other weird thing: Ellie Kent is American, yet my brain is so used to reading the dialogue in English mysteries with English accents that I had to keep going back and rereading, forcing my brain to read in an American accent. That's not a fault of the book, though, that's just my brain being dumb.Edit, 10/8/15: Okay, it's been about four months and I check at least every couple of weeks to see if the next book in the series has come out. It hasn't yet, there's not even a publication date yet, so I'm considering just rereading this book in the meantime.

Ellie has recently married The Reverend Graham Kent, a widower with a grown daughter, and has come to live in the vicarage with Graham and his Jack Russell, Hector. In fact, it is Hector who finds the dead body in the churchyard, but it is Ellie who falls under suspicion by the police.

Unfortunately, the dead stranger is neither the first nor last victim of the murderer - Ellie herself comes close to becoming a victim.It was quite a good mystery - I did figure out whodunit about 5 chapters before the unveiling, but it was still quite compelling nonetheless.

Boatwright.\u201d Goodreads, Goodreads, 30 May 2014, www.goodreads.com/book/show/22398705-....My review: I give this book \ud83c\udf77\ud83c\udf77\ud83c\udf77and I feel like I'm being generous. This simply didn't work for me. The premise was strong, but the biggest struggle I had was I didn't like Ellie Kent. At all. Or Graham - her husband, the Vicar. Or any of the other characters. They didn't feel quaint or cozy for an English village and that really disappointed me. They felt angry and self-absorbed most the time. This didn't read as a cozy mystery and that was what I wanted. The writing was fairly solid, although she has Ellie a comment about Shakespeare and an English village as if she didn't know he was from Stratford - an English village - and it really bugged me. I mean Ellie is supposed to be a Jane Austen expert and have taught at the collegiate level, and she was unaware? This made the character vapid. I also really struggled with the time line - we open to a naked Vicar that has recently returned from California with a new wife in tow after the death of his first wife. How long was the first wife dead? We are never told - I'm not sure how I feel about this. Dead for years - okay, good for you...dead for months - well, not so good. And he's very unsupportive of his new wife; she's slighted by him and the village at almost every turn as if she will never be as good as the first wife. This was difficult to swallow as in theory, the church should have welcomed her with open arms (again - this makes me think the marriage was hasty).  Anyway - this just wasn't my cup of English tea. I will not be pursuing the rest of the series, but there are several solid reviews out there of this novel - so it may still be something you want to read!For more about Mrs. Boatwright and the Ellie Kent series, visit her website at: http://alicekboatwright.com/"}, {"userName": "Jeannie and Louis Rigod", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3049435-jeannie-and-louis-rigod", "userReview": "This was a classic British cozy murder mystery. The reader is introduced to the new Mrs. Vicar, one Ellie Kent. It is a second marriage for both Ellie and her husband, Reverend Graham Kent. Ellie is an American and former University English Classics Professor. The Reverend Kent has charge of St. Michael's and All Angel's church in Little Beecham as well as the added responsibilities of being a widowed father of one daughter. Together the two newly married Kents have enough love to handle the large adjustments which will come their way...or do they?When a body is found in the Graveyard, the local police look immediately at the new Mrs. Kent. After all she is the newest foreigner in the village. The community which surrounds St. Michaels is filled with whispers, false smiles, true friends, and pillars of the church.Ellie sees the handcuffs coming her way and realizes that it will be up to herself to infiltrate this close village and find out what secrets caused the man's murder. As bodies begin to accumulate and police harassment increases Ellie senses that her marriage may not survive.This was a well-written and excellent view of being a new cleric's wife behind the scenes. I enjoyed the passages of poetry slipped in the dialog. All in all, I sincerely hope there will be a volume two."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3664828-laura", "userReview": "I used to be *really* into cozy mysteries. I mean *REALLY.* If it was a mystery involving baked goods, bookstores, caterers, the Cotswolds, etc., I was reading it. And then I just sort of stopped reading them in favor of other authors that were a little more realistic or darker. Maybe it was Scandi-crime that did it. I guess Agatha Christie counts as \"cozy\" and I've been working my way through those for the last couple of years. Other than these ur-cozies, though, I haven't been reading them much. I found this book as a free Prime Reading selection and I really liked it. It reminded me why I enjoyed those cozy mysteries so much. This was really well written and the characters were nicely developed. So far, there's only one more in the series but I am going to be sure and buy it. Because authors need to eat and pay bills too. :)Aside: what really counts as a cozy? I wouldn't consider Anne Perry, Charles Finch, Jacqueline Winspear or similar authors to be cozy writers, but maybe others would. Hmmm..."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21233709-valerie", "userReview": "This was only OK. With a few tweaks it would have been much better. The characters weren't enlarged enough to get a feel for who or what they really were. There was very little background given on how the newlywed Ellie and her vicar husband met, what drew them together, or indeed, what kept them together in their marriage. The interactions between them seemed strained and formal; I never got the feel that they loved, or even liked, each other. Ellie herself wasn't described, beyond that she had been a teacher, and had been married once before to an Italian poet. How old is she? What does she look like? The plot was good, but was carried out longer, I suppose to get more pages in the book, due to Ellie's refusal to share her finds or to communicate with her husband. Finally, toward the end of the book, my interest was snagged, and this is what earned my 2 stars. Maybe with time the author will draw more dimensions in her characters, but I don't plan on reading any more of her material."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80153679-nancy", "userReview": "This novel follows Ellie, an American academic who's recently moved to a small village in England, having married a vicar after a whirlwind romance. She's just starting to settle in when she discovers a dead body outside of the church and becomes a prime suspect of the investigation.I really dug this one. The writing was very well done and had clearly been well-edited and proofread; the story flowed well and kept me intrigued but didn't skimp on the worldbuilding or make the characters shallow. Also, it didn't feel too short, like a lot of cozies, but also didn't drag on. I only had a few nitpicks; the denouement felt a little slow, but the reveal of one sub-mystery felt kind of rushed and sudden. Also, towards the end, there was a little bit of what felt like sermonizing, though the rest of the book had been non-preachy; overall, though, these were pretty minor points in an otherwise great read, and I'm going to hunt down the sequel one of these days."}, {"userName": "Scilla", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1891647-scilla", "userReview": "Ellie Kent has just married Vicar Graham Kent, whose church is in Little Beecham in England.
