The two families have bitterly hated each other for decades, though no one can recall exactly how the feud started. When Romeo and Julie run into each other at a business seminar, they discover that not only do they not hate each other, they feel a mutual attraction. But they have to keep their affair secret because their grown children would be scandalized. Turning the traditional Romeo and Juliet on its head, Jeanne Ray's marvelous story zips along with the wit and elegance of a Shakespearean sonnet. Jeanne Ray's prose is absolutely sublime, and it's laced with humor.  One of the marvels of this story is that the main characters are not twenty-something twits. They're old enough to have grandkids, and prove the old adage that life does indeed begin at forty. The characters are realistic and you feel you could sit down and talk with them over coffee. I wish I could give this book more than five stars, because it's just so perfect.  It's probably true that literary talent runs in families, because Jeanne Ray is the mother of Ann Patchett, who has written several best sellers. I only wish Jeanne Ray had written more books."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1519524-kim", "userReview": "For some reason I thought this was about a young guy and gal.

Julie and Romeo is her first novel, published in 2000, and now I wish there were about a dozen more written between then and Eat Cake. Julie is the current owner of a florist shop. Romeo is the hated enemy owner of the rival flower shop. There the fun begins. Absent puffy sleeved velvet breeches, and weird feathered caps, I love this contemporary take on families feuding for generations and star-crossed lovers. That our protagonists are 60 makes it that much more delicious a story. Ray is a delightful writer, and her voice needs to be heard more.

Yes, their families each run a florist's shop, but there is plenty of business for both stores. In the process of this feud, 15 years before, Julie's daughter Sandy fell in love with Tony Cacciamani when they were both 16. They were caught trying to elope and their families broke up their relationship. In addition to that, there have been countless vindictive, retaliatory acts on the part of both families over the years, and each side of the feud regards the other as criminal scum.When Julie married Mort Roth at age 20, her parents and Mort asked her to stop working in the flower shop since they could only afford one employee. Julie worked a few years as a secretary, then became a stay-at home wife and mother to her two daughters for thirty years--until the day when she and Mort were 55, and he dumped her to run off with a 38-year-old woman. At that point Julie's parents were dead, and since they had left the flower shop entirely to Julie, Mort could not demand a piece of it in the divorce.Julie has taken back her maiden name and has been running the shop the past five years, greatly enjoying the flowers, but struggling with the financial side of the business, both keeping the books and generating capital. At the start of this story, the economy is in a downturn, and Julie's business is barely surviving. In hopes of improving her chances of saving it, she attends a conference for small business owners and meets Romeo Cacciamani in person for the first time. She is amazed to find that she feels no animosity toward this handsome man with kind eyes, and he clearly holds no resentment personally toward her. She had heard from a distance that his wife had died a few years ago, and when she expresses her sympathy, Romeo asks her to have coffee with him. Thus quietly begins a relationship that is a source of wonder and emotional rebirth to the two of them, but is anything but to their respective families. When the Cacciamani and Roseman clans inevitably find out about Julie and Romeo's romance, all hell breaks lose, and everyone from Romeo's 90-year-old mother to Julie's 32-year-old realtor daughter do everything in their power to break up the star-crossed lovers.This exquisitely written Romeo-and-Juliet tale updated into a contemporary romance between two mature lovers is a joy to read. Though there is a lot of poignancy in the story, it is also filled with wry, ironic humor that is frequently laugh-out-loud funny. The author also creates love scenes between her two mature protagonists that are both sensual and incredibly tender. Best of all, the ending of the story is uplifting, triumphant and very, very entertaining.I loved this book when I read it for the first time many years ago, and it was just as terrific an experience for me the second time around.In short, everything about this book is flawless as far as I'm concerned, and this book is a true keeper.The Kindle edition I read is well edited and formatted.I rate this book as follows:Heroine: 5 starsHero: 5 starsSubcharacters: 5 starsRomance Plot: 5 starsWriting: 5 starsOverall: 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Robert Palmer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3877218-robert-palmer", "userReview": "\"What's in a name ?

Someday we will be that age and want to be treated with respect and not be regarded as complete loons when we do something out of the ordinary that everyone is used to. I also loved that the main character looked at a long-standing family feud and worked to stop the cycle of anger. I have never been in such a powerfully angry situation but I can not imagine the toll it takes on you to be sooo angry with someone. Lucky me!

I heard ya the first 10 times already!!! I'm glad this was not my first sojourn into the world of Jeanne Ray. She seemed so desperate to re-sex the previous generation that there wasn't room for much more.....and yet I still found myself reading. Because I do like the characters of her world and I am anxious to see how things play out for them---despite my frustration with Julie and Romeo's willingness to let their families walk all over them. I mean are you 60 or not???? Doesn't that earn you the right to be an adult and tell your family to deal or get lost??? Her life after 40 point was so over-driven in this book that had I read it first I probably wouldn't have read any of her other books. By Step Ball Change and Eat Cake she honed her exuberance for the sectarian set and made a much for subtle and enjoyable point. DISCLAIMER--I will be reading the sequel to this book, Julie and Romeo Get Lucky, despite my misgivings about the original. As said before I do like this cast of characters and I am anxious to see them all grow up and move on---even those who are 60 or older. I also felt that the ending was bit too simplistic of a wrap up for decades of hatred so I will be interested in seeing if things in the post-feud world are really all rosy. And I would love to see Julie and Romeo weather real life together and be happy despite the monotony of it all. And that strikes at the essence of Ray's books, the belief in marriage and love despite extreme disappointments and set backs. And that's exactly what I want to believe in my life too and so I read them!"}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2336179-kathy", "userReview": "You want to know the one thing I really wanted to belated advise author Jeanne Ray about? Oh, of course you do.That is: do not put, on your author statement, that you are Ann Patchett's mom. Really. I don't care what your editors and publisher told you, don't do it. Don't go there. Don't invite me to compare your work to that of your daughter (one of my favorite contemporary novelists). And don't set me up for wondering--yeah, I know, it's fiction, of course you aren't talking about Real Life and your Family and your best friend, even though the best friend in the novel and your best friend are admittedly sharing a name--don't set me up for wondering \"hmmm, now is Ann the bitchy daughter or the sloppy one?\"But hey, it's a nice read. It is unthreatening and sweet. There are grandchildren. There are adult daughters. There is an ex husband (how did your Julie ever hook up with that guy?). There are flowers. There are people who, while they apparently run small businesses (into the ground), don't really have to keep business hours or worry their heads about stuff except as it fits the plot.All of that is typical fun chic lit.And to have a main character who is a passionate 60 year old woman? Very cool, though I was sort of uncomfortably imagining the reactions of the 20 something readers to the sex scenes. I mean, are they going to react the way I did when my older, 10 year old, bff explained the sex act to me (\"NOOOO, our parents would Never Do That!!!\")?And lots of weddings and sort of weddings? Well,isn't that fun?It's a respectably written fun book, and I will probably look for others by Ray.

I ended up loving the new dynamics that were introduced because of the characters' ages, like the fact that they both have children. The obstacles that Julie and Romeo face in their relationship felt interesting and new because there are so few books that tell stories like this. As with most any modern retelling of Romeo and Juliet, the family rivalry requires some suspension of disbelief. Still, I thought the adaptation was nice because (spoiler alert!) it does not end with a tragic death. Overall, a sweet and lighthearted book that I'm sure would resonate even more with an older audience. Think Love in the Time of Cholera but without the murder/suicide/rape. Also, Romeo and Julie both own flower shops - too cute.(P.S. First book of 2016! Yay!)"}, {"userName": "Kelli", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5857541-kelli", "userReview": "I'll begin my review by stating the negative. It was so annoying to read about Julie and Romeo (especially Julie) not being able to stand up for themselves against their families. I mean, they are 60 years old! Act like it by not letting their children push them around and boss them around. If my children tried to order me around, I would have put them in their places right then and there. With the negative out of the way, Julie and Romeo was a very delightful read. I have about twenty years before I get to my sixties, and this book gives me hope that maybe I will have love and sex even when I get up there in years. Who knows? But, anyway, the book was entertaining and amusing. Their budding romance was very sweet to read about. I've already marked \"to read\" the second book of the series.

The biggest difference is this isn't love lost teenagers....both of the main characters have been married previously, have grown children, and are about 60 years old. They still come from feuding families and there has been plenty of hate and disgust over the years. I laughed out loud and some of the situations these characters get into! This is a modern day book with no thought of saving \"it\" for marriage and there is a BIG swear word used by one of the hateful children when they find out about the parent's love for the enemy. I was grateful the language was a one time thing. I enjoyed the characters and their real life complexities so much, it would have been hard to quit reading it.

Throughout the entire book, up until the end, you don't know exactly why the relationships between the Rosemans and Cacciamanis have always been in contention. And the funny part is - neither do they! Only one surviving family member knows the reason...and the do not let go of the secret very easily!One of my favorite aspects of this book is the background of flowers via the two florist shops. Jeanne Ray obviously did some research on this subject because her descriptions of the flowers and arrangements make the flowers pop out in your mind.

All is well until the divorced Julie Roseman and the widowed Romeo Cacciamani meet by chance and are instantly attracted.
