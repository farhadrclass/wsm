I requested this galley on the strength of its intriguing blurb (Sex! And Crazy People!) but it's the season finale of Sons of Anarchy that propelled me to read this earlier than I intended. See Kem Nunn is a part of the show's writing team and anyone who connects that blurb with what SoA has delivered for six seasons (ie. women smacking other women with skateboards? The objectification of Charlie Hunnam's ass?) how could this fail?Dr. Eldon Chance is on the brink, juggling a life that he barely recognizes as his anymore. His unemployed wife is divorcing him for a younger man, their daughter is growing more and more distant, the iRS is onto him and his work as a professional expert witness in court is no longer enough to pay the bills. 49-years old and helpless, Chance is drawn to the seedy, underbelly of San Francisco's\u2026 er, fancy furniture forgers to remedy his financial woes and to his troubled patient Jaclyn Blackstone to restore some of his manhood by playing as his knight in shining armor against her abusive detective husband. And just to make things more interesting, Jaclyn has a multiple personality disorder and one of her personas is this side of a nymphomaniac who likes to break prostate glands.This is one of the most difficult books I've read, that I'm actually reluctant to say anything about it because I don't know if the unreliability of Chance as a narrator (at one point he describes Jaclyn as five-foot-one, in another she's five-foot-five), the allusions to hallucinations, the tangential and blurry references towards Nietzsche\u2026 I don't know if these are all pieces of someone's psychosis and I'm supposed to understand it as thus at that level. But since this was told from a third person's POV the narrative comes across cold, British and ancient, rendering the rambling nature of the storytelling pointless and an ill-fit to reflect Chance's state of mind. Or maybe its all just plain bullshittery disguised in frou-frou run-on sentences running into each other, leaving a catastrophic pile of almost sensible logic in its wake.\n\nTheir combined reports spoke to the absolute absurdity and utter frailty of things, to the shining truth that lay beneath what they were trying to sell and he wondered if the detective had ever been worn down by it or had wanted in some way of his own to strike through, to break free, to go under that he might rise above, before time and circumstance came for him as they will come for us all, never guessing, as people never do, that in a darkened alley behind a european massage parlor in a part of the city known as Ghost Town, yet one more of the walking wounded, skilled beyond reckoning in the art of the blade, was waiting to say hello.\n\nYes that's right, that is ONE fucking sentence. Its hard enough to keep track of which pants I've already worn last week but to keep track of THAT? Way too much braining, dude.Or maybe this book was just too smart for me. Hard to admit it but that could very well be where the problem lay. But I do believe that contingent to a successful psychological thriller is the reader being able to understand the basic foundations of the story. This story assumes you have some understanding of the tenets of psychiatry, of Nietzsche, Freud, De Clerembault Syndrome, Axioms and the Banach-Taraski paradox, which is flattering I guess, to some degree, to be expected to know all these things as well as one knows the breakfast menu at McDonald's.Then you realize you DON'T know all these things and you're sent in a spiral of self-doubt and loathing.Thanks book. Thanks.Maybe these are the machinations of a man on the precipice of becoming his own patient. Maybe I should have read this in one sitting (at the expense of a nosebleed as that quote is but one of the many run-on paragraphs this book had) to keep my focus.And maybe its entirely my fault for being too suspicious of every character in this psychological thriller seeing as nearly everyone in this book has a psychiatric condition diagnosed by Dr. Chance. It's probably also my fault for having experienced one too many WTF plot -twists that my reading brain's default setting is to interpret conversations and dialogue beyond what is being presented at face value. I mean watching 12 Monkeys, and that club Chuck Palahnuik expressly forbids us from talking about and even reading Gone Girl can really do a number in your brain when dealing with this genre. So yeah, I stuck around, waiting for that A-ha! moment, for the pieces to fall into their place and make sense of everything.Which never came.If you ever plan on reading this, there are no life rafts, no diaries, no video recordings to make sense of it all.My grasp of this story is similar to seeing something through a thick pane of opaque glass with water running down its surface under very dim lighting. I can see the parts, I can assume their movements and intentions, but I second guess every picture I form in the back of my mind. Maybe that was the point? To be vague and ambiguous, one run-on sentence after another?Who ever can derive pleasure from all that\u2026. needs to call me and explain.Also on BookLikesARC provided by Scribner thru NetGalley in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

It moved at a slow, leisurely pace instead of an all-out race. The vocabulary and sentence structure weighed in with a bit more heft than one might expect from your typical thriller, but I still felt shortchanged in the end. I had higher hopes for this tale, but I ended up facing the firing squad of disappointment with my head lowered and my hands held high.Jackie Black proved a bit more intriguing as a character than the prim and proper Jaclyn Blackstone, and Dr. Eldon Chance certainly had more than a few issues to work through. And there were other characters with issues to spare, leading the charge of disparity and marching out of step. Which did up the interest but I still managed to end up less than fully engaged. What made me shift a little more to the left was the forgettable nature of this troublesome tale.Nothing really stood out for me. Instead of being twisted in knots, I found myself sorely lacking in the suspense department, and maybe I didn\u2019t know about the bomb underneath the table that was about to go off, or the detective with the threats that seemed a little less demanding than I would have preferred. Either way, I ended the tale somewhat impressed with the writing but feeling as though the story lacked more than a few thrills.I received this book for free through NetGalley.Cross-posted at Robert's Reads"}, {"userName": "Still", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6752847-still", "userReview": "Amazon synopsis:Nunn\u2019s new novel is a dark book involving psychiatric mystery, sexual obsession, fractured identities, and terrifyingly realistic violence\u2014a tale told amid the back streets of California\u2019s Bay Area, far from the cleansing breezes of the ocean. This is a landscape where nameless persons lose their identities and find new ones after days of sex in a motel room, where homeless war veterans create neo-hippie encampments\u2014this is California noir, this is Kem Nunn country. It\u2019s not pretty, it\u2019s not sweet, but it is disturbing and unforgettable.The antihero of this book, Dr. Eldon Chance, a neuropsychiatrist, is a man primed for spectacular ruin. Into Dr. Chance\u2019s blighted life walks Jaclyn Blackstone, the abused, attractive wife of an Oakland homicide detective, a violent and jealous man. Jaclyn appears to be suffering from a dissociative identity disorder. In time, Chance will fall into bed with her\u2014or is it with her alter ego, the voracious and volatile Jackie Black? The not-so-good doctor, despite his professional training, isn\u2019t quite sure\u2014and thereby hangs his fascination with her. But when you get Jaclyn, you get her husband, Raymond, a formidable and dangerous adversary.Meanwhile, Chance also meets a young man named D, a self-styled, streetwise philosopher skilled in the art of the blade. It is around this trio of unique and dangerous individuals that longguarded secrets begin to unravel, obsessions grow, and the doctor\u2019s carefully arranged life comes to the brink of implosion.1930's Pulp-era icon The Shadow had the power to cloud men\u2019s minds. The protagonist of this noir thriller is an even worthier opponent of evil: he has the power to induce \u201csome cerebrovascular event\u201d if so called upon.I\u2019ve been a fan of Kem Nunn since coming across his second novel Unassigned Territory back in the 1980s in a remaindered bin and for which I paid $1.99 plus tax.Following that, I tracked down his previous novel, the basis of the film POINT BREAK, Tapping The SourceI own every novel of his published since then. Purchased each & every one as they came out as God herself intended me to have them.Kem Nunn has never let me down and while this is no mere \u201csurfer-dude\" novel unlike earlier (yet equally outstanding) \u201csurfer\u201d novels such as Tapping The Source or Tijuana Straits or Pomona Queen, it shoots the curl and when it appears the protagonist \u201cChance\u201d is overdue for a nice, reality inducing wipe out the Hand O\u2019God manifests. For \u201cgood\u201d or for \u201cbad\u201d.Highest of all possible recommendations.For less biased reviews of this novel check out the NY Times review: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/boo...Or the L.

Kem Nunn has abandoned almost everything that made him great in favor of a muddled, boring, utterly aimless stroll through the Bay Area. Nunn's gift for moody, California noir scene-setting has vanished. He can't even describe San Francisco's fog in a compelling manner. Instead, his text is riddled with the lamest cliches on every page, so many that I wondered if I was being pranked. His storytelling devices are also incredibly cliched _ multiple personalities, really? Every character save the lead is woefully underwritten, a half-hearted combination of cliche and weak imagination. The finale is laughably unsatisfying _ Chance doesn't remember what happened and wasn't involved _ and we're left with Nunn apparently anticipating a series of books about this weak, unfocused protagonist and his superhuman sidekick. It's such a depressing experience to realise Chance and Tapping the Source were written by the same man. Chance contains almost nothing that I love about Nunn, aside from a few stray turns of elegant phrase, and so much that I hate about modern pulp fiction. Two of the worst books I've read in the last 2 years were novels set in my native Bay Area by two of my favorite writers: Michael Chabon's awful Telegraph Avenue, and now Kem Nunn's Chance.

Superficially it treads the same neurotic waters as Jonathan Kellerman\u2019s Dr Alex Delaware investigations, where the reader is given psychological insights into the mechanisms of the unravelling mind.But author Kem Nunn takes many more risks than Kellerman does, and pulls away all the anchors from his good doctor\u2019s sleek, urban existence. Think of the corruption of Will Graham in the TV series Hannibal and you\u2019ll get a sense of the existential peril which assaults forensic neuropsychiatrist Dr Eldon Chance.The vulnerable Dr Chance falls for a femme fatale when he\u2019s at a low ebb, emotionally and financially exhausted by divorce. He makes a questionable decision which sets the dominos of moral ambiguity tumbling\u2026 until suddenly he\u2019s confronted with all too physically painful consequences of his increasingly criminal actions. The author has crafted a modern day descent into hell, where weakness, lust, greed, cowardice and obsession contribute to the professional, intellectual and spiritual unravelling of the central character.Psychology and psychiatry are at the core of the story. The opening chapters feature a succession of superb case study sketches, in which the doctor encapsulates his patients\u2019 personality disorders in a few presumptuous statements. He is pride personified, heading for a very big fall. It comes his way in the shape of sexual obsession mixed with multiple personalities\u2026Speaking of which, the chain of events surrounding the woman of his dreams / bunny-boiler, and her possessive corrupt cop husband, become increasingly unlikely as the plot progresses. Even my credibility was strained in the final chapters. On the other hand, D is a fabulous character. Is he really the implacable, streetwise, military veteran he appears to be? Or is he another fantasist, another individual carving out an identity of his own creation? Hang on, isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re all doing?Only a brave author risks incorporating Kierkegaard and Nietzsche into noir these days. Those readers who prefer their psychological thriller to be free of geometric paradoxes, and who hate half-page paragraphs made up of a single, convoluted sentence stuffed with dependent clauses, should probably stick to something more conventional.8/10There's a more detailed review (and many others) over at https://murdermayhemandmore.wordpress..."}, {"userName": "Ellen Keim", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/970590-ellen-keim", "userReview": "I read this while watching the series on Hulu which is based on it. (\u201cChance,\u201d starring Hugh Laurie) I think I enjoyed the book a little more than the series, although it was interesting to see how the book was adapted for the screen. A great deal of the dialogue was straight from the book, which perhaps isn\u2019t surprising considering that the author has written for shows like \u201cDeadwood\u201d and \u201cSons of Anarchy,\u201d besides being a novelist. The main character, Eldon Chance, is at a crossroads in his life. Basically everything he once took for granted is falling apart. The question is, did he go looking for what happens to him in this book, or was it just chance? The novel is more than an interesting plot. The main characters are memorable (especially Big D) and the troubles Chance encounters are just more extreme versions of things we all grapple with: identity, dishonesty, integrity, love, obsession, loyalty, friendship, bucking the status quo, and making things right. If you have to choose between the book and the series, I would choose the book. But I think they complement each other, plus I think there\u2019s a second season that goes beyond the scope of this book, so if you can, I would read the book and watch the series."}, {"userName": "John McKenna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7390748-john-mckenna", "userReview": "Mysterious Book Report No. 155by John Dwaine McKennaSome of the best thriller and crime fiction stories are built around the premise of an ordinary person being put into an extraordinary situation. For example . . . Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and as a result, develops supernatural powers which totally change his life as he becomes \u2018The Amazing Spiderman,\u2019 a crusading crime fighter and doer of good deeds. Far fetched? Absolutely, you betcha. Does it make for good stories? Ditto. What I want to emphasize however, is not the Spiderman stories, but that one extraordinary event which changed him forever and made him a super hero.In Chance, (Scribner, $26.00, 320 pages, ISBN 978-0-7432-8924-5) by Kem Nunn, we\u2019re introduced to Dr. Eldon Chance, a forensic psychiatrist who makes his living by reviewing the medical files of persons accused of committing a crime, then testifying in court as to their sanity. He\u2019s a perfectly ordinary guy who\u2019s estranged from his wife, about to be divorced, living in an apartment while his soon to be ex-wife is living with her personal trainer boyfriend and Chance\u2019s estranged teenaged daughter in the house Chance used to own, and is still paying for. He\u2019s a guy who is teetering on the precipice of ruination, if not damnation. It\u2019s been years since Chance has seen a patient, because his type of practice doesn\u2019t require it. He\u2019s a disaster just waiting to happen, and happen it does when a patient named Jaclyn Blackstone is referred to him, suffering from periods of memory loss and an inability to concentrate for long periods of time. Dr. Chance diagnoses her as possibly having a multiple personality disorder, brought about by physical, psychological or sexual abuse. She\u2019s married to an abusive Oakland homicide detective who\u2019s threatened to kill her if she tries to leave him. Of course, she\u2019s a gorgeous California beauty with drop dead good looks and a huge sexual appetite . . . making it oh, so easy, for Chance to commit the ultimate breach of medical ethics and tumble head over heels into bed with her. Suddenly, his ordinary life is turned upside down as Dr. Chance is hunted by Jaclyn\u2019s morally bent, jealous husband and his cohorts in the police department. In fear of his life, Chance hooks up with a misfit, ex-special forces soldier known only as \u2018Big D\u2019 who tries to instruct the hapless psychiatrist in urban guerilla fighting techniques without much success. The novel is twisted, suspenseful and diabolic, just what you\u2019d expect from a writer of TV shows like Sons of Anarchy and Deadwood, which in fact Kem Nunn has done. Action and intrigue fans will be entranced, delighted and absorbed!Like the review?

(2014). Kem Nunn. **.I\u2019m not sure what genre category to place this novel. It is a thriller whose principal protagonist is a neuropsychiatrist. He meets a patient who is suffering from multiple personality disorder, and he ultimately falls in love with one (or is it two) of the women. This might be OK if her husband wasn\u2019t a vindictive policeman. The story takes off from there, as you might imagine. The author, Nunn, manages to spice up the story with heavy loads of psychological and neurological terms that had me turning to Google constantly, but it at least gave me the feeling of being there. Where the book fell down was in its lack of substance of the characters themselves. They seemed like cardboard cut-outs more than real people.

The blurb on this book is really intriguing and fascinating and that's what made me request the title from Netgalley the moment I was done reading it.Prior to this I was not aware of the author and perhaps wouldn't have requested the title based on that, had it not been for his association with SOA. Now it doesn't seem like a very prudent decision.I have lots of grievances with this book the foremost being that I simply could not connect with its protagonist Dr. Eldon Chance, I couldn't even like him much to be honest. I get it his life is in for a toss, at age 49 he is heading for a divorce from his wife of two decades who has traded him for a younger model. A divorce which is costing him literally even the clothes on his back since he just doesn't have to bear expenses of his lawyer, but that of his wife' as well not to mention pay her alimony and child support. But he is such a dull character that I couldn't find myself empathizing with him at any point nor could he arouse the least bit of sympathy within me.My next grievance would be the crazy long sentences seriously, it took me three reads to grasp some paragraphs at the least. Not to mention that I couldn't grasp things like De Clerembault Syndrome, Axioms and the Banach-Taraski paradox. And I was loathe to rely on Google and Wikipedia, everytime things like these cropped up. When a book makes me search for a thing or two I have no idea of it is interesting, amazing even to learn new things. When a book makes me want to abandon it and rather surf mindless memes on the net instead I know its beyond my capability as a reader to go on with it, but I did with much reluctance on my part and ended up with a massive headache and not the slight bit of understanding of the plot of this novel.When I had requested Chance, I was hoping it would be the kind of crazy ride Gone Girl was, when I was done with it, I could barely remember half of the things I read and was just in pursuit of the strongest coffee along with 2 tablets of Ibuprofen.I in all honesty cannot recommend this title to anyone.This title was provided to be by Netgalley via Scribner in exchange for an honest review.

If he was never actually in the military, how did he acquire the fighting and weapons skills he demonstrated throughout the book? I also felt Chance's ongoing debate about the sale of his furniture was unnecessary; while that sale provided a good opening to introduce D and Carl, the continued hints about Chance having to deal with a Russian mobster over the furniture never went anywhere and so became distracting from the primary adversarial relationship between Chance and Detective Blackstone.

Nunn has a number of good elements in his hand including his agility to breathe life into his offbeat characters. \"D\" a largely self-invented warrior and Chance's assistant, Lucy with quirks a-poppin' both have great appeal and charm in Nunn's dark and depressing world. Sadly, the overall impact of the story neither enlightens nor reveals more nuanced views of human thought and behavior. It just keeps flailing away at the reader, thwack a wack a thawck, that people are motivated by selfish and greedy impulses, that everyone is a whack job at heart, that we spend our days weaving through horrors that are largely self-created. Chanceis a ceaseless tale of woe and humans behaving badly that will appeal to many readers intrigued with noir. For myself, I'd rather read Misery again than spend more time with Nunn's creations.

It's as if he has literally forgotten how to write. Never a master of believable or well-structured plot, here he loses control of style and character as well, so what remains is a something like a Dean Koontz/Stephen King piece, minus the usually focused premise, but plus the occasional turn of memorable phrase. 'Chance' opens with a setting, character, and theme quite removed from Nunn's typical fare, though it quickly becomes the same old descent into violent underground madness.

Thinking of the divorce, his daughter having to change schools, and the IRS on his tail because of his wife's business, law-abiding Chance said he would ponder.Then he acquires a patient, Jaclyn Blackstone, a homely woman with an abusive husband (a homicide detective in Oakland). Jacklyn was referred for an evaluation when she became aware that her sleepwalking and missing periods of time were related to another personality: Jackie Black. Dr. Chance referred her to Janice Silver and expected, like all his other clients he'd referred to a psychotherapist, that he would never see her again. However, after a chance meeting at a bookstore, he found Jacklyn's changed appearance and demeanor distracting, especially since he'd never considered being unfaithful when married and had only once (early in his career) become involved with a patient. Even as he was wondering if this beauty was Jaclyn, Jackie, or another alter-ego, his thoughts were unwillingly drawn to her while simultaneously being relieved he was not acting on the attraction.Then comes the accident. Janice Silver asks Chance to visit Jacklyn in the hospital - suffering from injuries presumably from her husband.Depressed and drinking more and more he disregards his former self who over-thought and made cautious decisions, thus making a sharp turn and lots of poor decisions taking us on a really thrilling ride!"}, {"userName": "Jeannette M.

Chance is feeling his life slide slowly down hill when he meets Jaclyn Blackstone. His wife has taken up company with a personal trainer; his adolescent daughter, discovering boys, booze and rebellion, is furious that she may have to leave her beloved private school for public school; and the IRS has discovered what they consider to be irregularities in his past tax filings.His work consists of evaluating patients for attorneys, insurance companies or other doctors. He is increasingly becoming obsessed with former patients, who through no fault of their own, were thrown into horrific situations that have completely derailed their lives.Then Jaclyn is referred to him. Married to a corrupt Oakland homicide cop prone to sudden outbreaks of violence that have landed her in the hospital, Jaclyn believes that she has an alternative personality, \"Jackie,\" who keeps going back to her abusive husband. While the psychiatrist he refers her to for treatment remains skeptical about the multiple personalities and the reasons why Jacklyn stays involved with an abusive man, Chance sees a vulnerable woman in need of protection. He's willing to bend the rules of his profession to help her. As a result, he finds himself in a battle that causes him to question his own nature.This is a well, tightly written novel with fascinating characters. You'll find yourself wanting to read this book in one sitting."}, {"userName": "Kevin Lyons", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12956559-kevin-lyons", "userReview": "There is a clear divide between the reviews for this narrative; those enamored with Nunn forgive him his lapses of protracted imagery. Clearly, others find them both tedious and irksome. The epilogue is overly long and tiresome but the general arch of the story was well executed. Chase, midling in years, comes to know himself in extreme circumstance and is changed by the knowledge. Two themes are repeated and echo throughout; \"history comes for the empire\" and the \"fragility of things\". Both are ways of saying the same thing; all things end. How long must a man cling to the effigies of his innocents? The things of youth are long past Chance's grasp; yet, he dearly clings to their tattered shreds as circumstance pushes and pulls him into change. The end of the man he was and the beginning of the man he is."}, {"userName": "Frances", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2102951-frances", "userReview": "I found the story got really tangled towards the end, and the protagonist went from being a self-involved, hesitant man to a man who was so incredibly tied up in his own head that I was distanced from the story.I picked this up because I really loved the one-season TV series, and I feel that was better than the book; the visual presentation and lack of a voiceover keeps readers from being shoved away from the story by Chance's internal monologue and philosophical ruminations."}, {"userName": "Hectaizani", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/290746-hectaizani", "userReview": "I started reading this book about a forensic neuropathologist and his descent into the depths of moral ambiguity because I started watching the series on Hulu.
