So many things about this debut book by Regina Jennings really drew me in.I really liked the Mexican heroine! And the fact that Rosa is so ignorant of the way a \u201cproper\u201d lady should act. It made for quite a few humorous moments! Rosa was so sweet natured and hard-working, you can\u2019t help but love her. Just like Ruth, she is filled with an intense desire to provide for Louise. Weston\u2019s desire to protect and care for his family made him a very likeable hero, too\u2014not to mention a very handsome one!When Rosa (like Ruth) goes to Weston in the barn, she slips into the bed with him and (unlike Ruth) curls up against his chest. Now, I understood how this wasn\u2019t supposed to be exactly like the story of Ruth, but just thought to mention this, since they do embrace each other in bed before they\u2019re married. Though, of course, nothing else happens!My favorite\u2014favorite!\u2014scene was when Rosa does the Mexican dance and afterwards when Weston stops it and follows her. Wowza, did I laugh when Weston realized what he did! While in the last few chapters I seriously wanted to slap the two upside the head with frustration, Sixty Acres and a Bride was a wonderful read from start to finish. I can\u2019t wait to read more by this very talented author!"}, {"userName": "Karen Witemeyer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2464479-karen-witemeyer", "userReview": "Regina Jennings has captured something wonderful with her historical romance debut. Characters full of culture and family values dance off the page to warm the reader's heart. I adored the hard-working Rosa as she battled against predjudice and difficult circumstances to try to make a home for herself and her mother-in-law in a new land. Her tomboy athleticism paired wonderfully with her innocent femininity. And Weston made the perfect hero for her with his protective nature and his dedication to family. Not to mention those broad shoulders and handsome good looks! Neither of them wanted romance, but it simmered nicely beneath the surface anyway. There were times near the end when I wanted to shake some sense into the two of them, but the added tension just made the resolution all the sweeter.I loved seeing a Mexicana heroine. I have read very few if any books that featured a non-Anglo heroine, and I enjoyed being introduced to some of her culture and cheered when her hero saw only her beauty and fortitude and not the color of her skin. I look forward to seeing more from this talented new author!"}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/737986-kimberly", "userReview": "[they were married (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Anne Osterlund", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2232237-anne-osterlund", "userReview": "After her husband\u2019s death in a mine disaster, Rosa has left her home in the Mexican mountains to come to Caldwell, Texas and start a new life.

I didn't feel like there was much romance between the two leads, I felt like it was more about both Rosa and Weston overcoming the aftermath their disastrous first marriages.I thought there might be more about Rosa's Mexican heritage, but I felt like most of the book concentrated on the people of her new town trying to stomp out any reminders of her heritage, especially in the way she dressed and acted. I also didn't like the way the picture was painted that because she was from Mexico, she was the town harlot. This is just something that rubbed me the wrong way personally, I know that other readers didn't get this message from the book at all.The two leads were lovely characters, I just felt like the romance between them wasn't developed enough. It didn't seem like enough was added to the typical historical story of life in a western town.Overall, a nice story, but didn't have the extra oomph I was looking for. book sent by publisher in exchange for honest reviewreviewed for http://inthehammockblog.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1467086-becky", "userReview": "Regina is a friend of mine. We were both 'hired' by Bethany House around the same time and met when we journeyed to the Bethany House headquarters one weekend to meet the staff. She's lovely.I cannot BELIEVE that Sixty Acres and a Bride is her first ever manuscript. As I told her myself, I'm extremely jealous. :) She wrote this novel and sold it all within one calendar year, which is phenomenally remarkable in the world of publishing (where most of us slave over multiple manuscripts for multiple years before finally --maybe-- getting one in print).Sixty Acres tells the story of Rosa (who comes to Texas from Mexico with her mother-in-law) and Weston (a Texas rancher). The story is a fun Old West interpretation of the Ruth & Naomi story from the Bible. I was charmed by the warm, close-knit-family feel of the book as well as Rosa's spunkiness and hard work. And I really enjoyed that Rosa and her mother-in-law were able to recognize, during the course of the plot, their similarities to Ruth and Naomi. Well done, Regina!

Weston was an especially strong character. The parallels to the Bible account and this one were well done. Rosa came from Mexico to Caldwell County, Texas with her mother-in-law Louise after her husband was killed in a mining accident. Rosa was treated as a foreigner and not shown much kindness and respect by several of the towns people. The novel was well done.

And they usually do them, never in a small way, but with pure unadulterated gusto bringing the audience/reader to that place where you laugh out loud at the character\u2019s mistakes as you can relate because you have been there yourself. Spunky Rosa, the main character in Sixty Acres and a Bride, by Regina Jennings delivers these moments in spades. It was with a little bit of trepidation I must admit that I began this novel as I thought- here we go \u2013 an updated Ruth/Naomi story set in Texas in 1878, I wonder how this will fly? But trust me, this first offering by Regina Jennings does fly, in fact I might say it soars. I really, really, enjoyed the character of Rosa, a beautiful Mexican widow returning to Texas with her mother- in- law Louise Garner to save the family farm so to speak. Of course, this is Rosa\u2019s first time in Texas and so poor Rosa doesn\u2019t know how to dress, how and when to speak, or how to impress this small town\u2019s people as she is the object of much gossip and naysayers because of her outsider\u2019s ways. But she is smart, beautiful and a very hard worker and thus captures the essence of \u201cRuth\u201d perfectly, but in a fun and new way. Then there\u2019s Weston Garner, her now dead husband\u2019s cousin, who is attractive, well off, and a widower himself with a story to tell. He is of course cast as the Boaz character to the story, the kinsman redeemer. But it seems to me as the story progresses that they seem to rescue each other. I felt that both character\u2019s were written well as their attraction built, but both coming to the table with a little bit of relationship baggage that needed to be dealt with before the relationship could fully develop. The story is rounded out with a really good villain in a neighbor named Mr. Tillerton who is easy to despise. He brings that sense of tension and suspense to the story as every good story needs a really good bad guy! Through many dangers, toils and snares, goodness and love do finally prevail in this really fun story by Regina Jennings and for those that are fans of a good Christian historical fiction book, I think you will find this a delightful twist on the age old story of Ruth and Boaz. Regina Jennings gives us a heroine to cheer on, a hero with room to grow and grow he does, and a delightful ending where all is as it should be. Congrats to you Regina on a wonderful debut novel.4 starsThis novel was graciously provided for me to read for review by Bethany House publishers with the sole intent of soliciting an honest and unbiased review.

I stayed up late to finish it on one hand, but there were some aspects that I didn't like. What I didn't like: Why do authors so often put in a creepy dude? Mr. Tillerton stalked Rosa and was totally inappropriate. While believable, I didn't like that aspect of the story.Also, I thought the reason for marriage was shaky (I would say more, but I don't want to give away the book). I wish that Weston had found another way that honored Rosa's feelings.What I did like: It was so much like the book of Ruth! How cool is that?

But even though some things that happened in the story that drove me crazy, those things didn't take away from the story's overall appeal. I loved how the book paralleled the story of Ruth in the Bible and how the author did a pretty amazing job at making it fit in 1878 in Texas where instead of Ruth being a Moabitess, the heroine Rosa was a Mexican. I thought it worked well for the story. The author did a great job with the setting as well. I felt completely grounded in the time period throughout the story.The scenes where some amazing chemistry simmered between Weston and Rosa were hot enough to melt chocolate, but for me, they cooled too quickly, like cool water on a fire. I don't mind that type of angst a few times here and there, but it got to the point where I wanted to say, \"Enough already!\" At the same time, the fact that I cared enough to get frustrated with them says a lot about the author's ability to keep a reader engaged. This story contained the classic 'poor communication' that usually makes for ongoing conflict in romance novels. It worked for this story for the most part, but there were a few times I wanted to yell at Rosa and say, \"Come on, chica, he loves you. Don't you see that?\" At the same time, her reservations made sense given her past.The thing that intrigued me most about Rosa's character was her sincerely felt obligation to earn her keep and be useful. She couldn't see herself as being loved for anything but her ability to help others. Surely no one would love her for herself. How often we act that way with God. He loves us with a love that can't be earned or changed regardless of what we do, yet sometimes we find ourselves striving to \"earn our keep\" as Christians.It looked pretty ridiculous when Rosa was acting that way, so I thought about how silly our striving must appear to God. Sometimes God will do like Weston did and say, \"fine, you want to try and earn your favor? Go ahead and see if you can do it.\" Then He leaves us to our own devices until we are miserable and want our relationship with Him restored to where it was before... when we trusted God and allowed Him to love us the way He wanted to. Of course, we can't make God love us any more regardless of what we do. That was well illustrated in this story. At least that was what I got out of those scenes.All in all, this was a good read. I would definitely read another novel by Ms. Jennings, especially if it's a historical romance. She's gifted when it comes to writing internal dialog and engaging the reader's emotions. On the one hand I felt like I was being tortured emotionally along with the characters, but that was one of the things that made this book special. I loved the fact that I cared about what happened to them. I would definitely recommend this story to lovers of historical fiction and romance."}, {"userName": "Kav", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6025638-kav", "userReview": "As exquisite as the cover, Sixty Acres and a Bride makes a solid case for judging a book by its cover. Sublime! I enjoyed every minute and didn't want my reading experience to end. This is the kind of book you grieve over at the finish. (I'm still in mourning.)The author definitely engaged this reader with dynamic characters that quickly became real people who charged into my life and practically took it over. I laughed with them, I cried with them and I worried over them whenever I managed to drag myself back into the real world.Jennings did an amazing job with her heroine's storyline. Rosa is a displaced person in so many ways, having suffered enormous losses in her young life. Desperate for a place and people to belong to, she strives to adapt to a foreign culture filled with unfamiliar ways. I think every reader will be able to identify with that yearning and that is what makes Rosa's journey so poignant. She's a winning combination of grit and vulnerability. Of course that lambasts poor Weston who can't define Rosa's place let alone keep her in it!One of the brilliant strengths of this book is their incredible love story.It's not an easy journey and definitely fraught with all manner of obstacles but Jennings has mastered the craft of romance. She kept me riveted with tantalizing scenes that were deeply intimate even though Rosa and Weston didn't even touch. But when they did...oh la la!!!!! Haul in the fainting couch one more time, ladies, you might as well recline there while you read. No point in getting up and risking a head injury when you fall back down again!This book also has one of the best seamless inspirational threads. It develops naturally from within different characters in so many scenes and always seems plausible. It enhances the story and uplifts the reader which is exactly as it should be in an inspirational romance.Sixty Acres and a Bride is definitely destined for keeper shelves across the country. Don't pass this one by and when you're at the store buy two -- one for you and one for a friend!\"Book has been provided courtesy of Baker Publishing Group and Graf-Martin Communications, Inc.

Regina Jennings is a masterful wordsmith that infuses life and authenticity into this story and her characters. I adored how sensory her writing is, in that images and gestures lept of the page while the rustling of skirts, the lilt of a flute and the baying of sheep resonated in the air. Deeply rooted in family loyalty and sacrifice, the heart of this story is truly beautiful. The Garner family is bound by an unbreakable bond of love that is evidenced in all that they do and say. None of them can overcome the burden of hurt, guilt, or fear without the family embracing them and help guide their steps when their own strength is not sufficient. Flawlessly intertwined into this is a faith journey that is constantly at work beneath the surface, but comes about organically. Regina Jennings also exercised her funny bone on occasion to the enrichment of the story. The interplay between Rosa and Wes had some purely comedic moments that added to the complexity and romance of their relationship. Rosa brands her resilience and and fortitude as a shield to protect her vulnerable heart from further devastation, which is not unlike Wes' self imposed isolation and desperate need to protect all within the Garner family fold. As the layers are stripped back, these characters expose the rawness of their emotions and heart without pretense. There is so much more to this story and I encourage you to discover it for yourself. A sensational debut novel!Rating: 9/10**Book has been provided courtesy of Baker Publishing Group and Graf-Martin Communications, Inc.

Having met and married Mack in Mexico, Rosa isn\u2019t prepared for life in Texas, and the people of Plum Creek aren\u2019t prepared for her foreign clothing or behaviour. But before she can figure out how the locals want her to act, Rosa has to help Louise pay off the taxes on their family home. The task facing the two widows is momentous, and they have little chance of meeting their goal before their home is bought up by their neighbour, who has his sights set on Rosa more so than her home. Their only hope is in Weston Garner, a fellow widower and relative who might just be able to help the women pay their debts. Can Rosa stoop to begging a strange man for help before it\u2019s too late? And can either of them handle the ramifications of the agreement they make?The biggest compliment that I can give Sixty Acres and a Bride is that it reminded me of Kim Vogel Sawyer\u2019s writing, which makes me hope that Regina has what it takes to someday be as popular as Kim in this genre. Regina\u2019s setting and secondary characters made me feel involved in the story, just as some of Kim\u2019s novels have. But Regina also brings something new to the genre \u2013 namely, the character of Rosa, who was a welcome change from the more typical heroines. I honestly struggle to think of a time that I\u2019ve read a Christian romance novel set in this era where the heroine is Mexican. I adored the descriptions of Rosa\u2019s clothes, and if they look anything like the ones pictured on the front cover of this novel then I\u2019m quite envious. However, I can also see why Rosa stuck out so much in Texas, and her initial mishaps were both amusing and touching to read about.But as with Kim's books, Sixty Acres and a Bride just didn't have that little extra spark that pushed the story up into the \"Loved it!\" category for me. While my emotions got very riled up at the character of Mr Tillerton and his treatment of Rosa, and the general animosity that met Rosa when she first arrived in Plum Creek (I can\u2019t be the only one who thought of Little House on the Prairie every time the town\u2019s name was mentioned, right?) I also got pretty annoyed with the way that Weston and Rosa could have figured out their difficulties if they\u2019d actually talked to each other! These are two very different sets of emotions to experience when reading a book. The first set is good, and the ability to make a reader get so involved in a story that they start feeling angry on behalf of a character is a talent that I greatly admire. But getting annoyed with the characters because you\u2019re fed up with them continually making a mess of things isn\u2019t so good. I didn\u2019t mind the conflict between Rosa and Weston initially, but after it dragged on I started to get a bit fed up as it could have been resolved so easily. This may be just be a matter of a personal preference, since I\u2019m the kind of person who doesn\u2019t let an issue go undiscussed for more than five minutes. Perhaps those who share Rosa and Weston\u2019s stubbornness will be able to relate to this situation better. Aside from the weaknesses in the conflict, my only other issue with Sixty Acres and a Bride was the pacing. It\u2019s hard to describe what bothered me about it, but something just felt a little bit \u201coff\u201d about the pacing and I found it particularly hard to follow the plot at the start of the novel. There were several places where I got confused as to whose thoughts and feelings were being described and I had to backtrack to see whether or not the perspective had changed. After my initial difficulties with this novel I was able to settle into it better and struggled less with the pacing as the story developed, but it was a bit off-putting to begin with. If you\u2019re just about to start this novel, I will say that it\u2019s worth the read, so don\u2019t let any confusions at the beginning of the story put you off. As long as it took to get to the conclusion, I was pleased with how everything worked out, and I was sighing with relief when Rosa and Weston finally confronted each other about their feelings. The conclusion was particularly satisfying, and made me hopeful for Regina\u2019s next novel. I\u2019m wondering if she may revisit Molly in the future, as she was a secondary character that I found particularly interesting. Despite her scheming tendencies I did feel quite sorry for her as nothing ever seemed to go her way. And if not Molly, I hope that Regina\u2019s next heroine is just as unconventional as Rosa.While I do have my personal qualms with the conflict and the pacing of Sixty Acres and a Bride, I\u2019m sure that these are issues that will be smoothed out in subsequent novels. For a debut, Sixty Acres and a Bride definitely shows potential, particularly as Regina brings something new to the genre. As much as I love to read Christian historical fiction, the genre definitely needs to be shook up every now and again, and I hope that Rosa\u2019s story does just that. I also love that the cover of Sixty Acres and a Bride is branching out from some of the more typical covers in this genre. As pretty as some of them are, they do get a little repetitive after a while, and I really felt that this cover reflected Sixty Acres and a Bride as well as Rosa\u2019s character. Hopefully both this novel and its cover are a sign of good things to come from Regina Jennings.Review title provided by Bethany House."}, {"userName": "Laura Jean", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5478121-laura-jean", "userReview": "Totally not my genre, but I liked it fairly well.

How did Ruth feel about practically forcing Boaz to marry her? And likewise, how did Boaz feel?Regina Jennings' novel Sixty Acres and a Bride looks deeper into the story of Ruth, exploring the relationships, emotions, and prejudices that might have similarly affected Ruth and Boaz themselves.Placing it in 1878 Texas, with Rosa, the Ruth equivalent, a native Mexican who accompanies her American mother-in-law back to Texas, Jennings dives right into the prejudice toward and the fascination of a foreigner who tries to join the rest of society rather than existing on its fringes. Since she is now the daughter-in-law of one of their own, the locals cannot ignore Rosa and must try to accept her in spite of her improper ways. As a foreign woman, she is colorful and different, attracting the eyes of the male population while inspiring jealousy and horror among the women. Modest attire in the Sierra Madres turns out to be scandalous in Texas; a dance that embodies propriety in Mexico becomes a seductive act suggesting wanton behavior among the Americans. Rosa stumbles repeatedly in American culture, just as Ruth no doubt experienced the shock of Israelite culture. In addition to cultural mistakes Rosa makes, she also faces the prejudice of a Mexican among Americans - even today, Hispanic immigrants are often seen as second-class citizens and automatically disregarded due to their coloring and country of birth. Likewise, the Moabites, though far distantly related to the Israelites, were not children of Abraham, and therefore little better than the other heathen nations surrounding them. Ruth was every bit the second-class citizen as Rosa. Jennings also depicts the horror and embarrassment of the girl as she humbles herself to a reputation-shattering position as she begs financial rescue for herself and her mother-in-law. In Sixty Acres and a Bride, Rosa pleads with the kinsman redeemer for money rather than marriage, but the end result is the same - he saves them financially and chooses to marry her (though as much to salvage her reputation as out of attraction). So Rosa finds herself saddled to a man who married her through obligation, and her husband knows that she, too, married him under duress; they must learn together how to love and respect each other as spouses and overcome the fear of potentially being unloved in return. Ruth and Boaz could not have been much better acquainted, and probably had less of a relationship before marriage than Rosa and her Weston. Ruth 4:13 says, \"So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife, and when he went in to her, the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son.\" It offers no details of how their relationship progressed, whether it took a day or a year before they were comfortable together as a couple. Jennings' novel offers us just one possibility to consider, but it also inspires us to contemplate other situations Ruth may have experienced, and even how we ourselves might act under similar circumstances. Overall, Sixty Acres and a Bride is a beautiful story - detailed, exciting, sprinkled with moments of humor, sporting a villain one loves to hate, filled with tenderness, and ripe with hope. Not many novels inspire me to tears, but as a bride myself, I found that this one really speaks to the hopes and fears of a young marriage. No matter how in love and prepared one feels prior to the wedding ceremony (and Rosa and Weston scarcely felt ready at all), learning to put aside one's individual self in order to live as one with one's spouse is a bumpy road, and small misunderstandings between a husband and wife can lead to great hurt without immediate reconciliation. Thankfully, God's grace sufficiently covers us in our foolishness, and Jesus came to heal our bodies and hearts (and, of course, to save), and so we can truly love our spouses with God's perfect help. \"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear,\" I John 4:18a."}, {"userName": "Bt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2383188-bt", "userReview": "How did this manage to get such good Goodreads reviews? It was terrible! I thought the concept was great. The story of Ruth set in the Old West? Sounds cool! But no. It was extremely tedious. And the relationship between the \"Ruth and Boaz\" characters was just so agonizingly slow and forced. I actually started getting suspicious of a bad book after the end of chapter one. Do you know what happens in chapter one? Rosa's (Ruth's) wagon looses a wheel, and her mother-in-law goes to get help lifting it. Rosa, who is much smarter, stronger, and prettier than pretty much all the other women, deduces that (wow!) moving all the weight to the other side will make it easier to lift, and she does so. A bunch of men come by and gawk at her, and \"by the time the front end of the wagon was lifted, money was exchanging hands. No wonder there was such a crowd. She'd stumbled in to some sort of wager. Whatever the stakes, the men seemed to be entertained.\"What? In the time frame of, like, 15 minutes, she manages to gather a large crowd of men betting on her by... moving boxes and chickens around? That's just awkward. It's not actually interesting to read about, and it doesn't even make me sympathize with Rosa. It makes me say, \"This is messed up!\" and want to put the book down. These men must have serious problems with lust and also with respecting others... but these are the townspeople we're dealing with for the rest of the book!Also, the thing was so predictable I could hardly stand it. Most readers will already know the Bible story of Ruth, so the author needed to add something to make it interesting. I have read many books where I knew the basic plot but was still very interested in the novelization. But since the whole suspense of the story for a long time was, \"How is Rosa going to get the money?!\" and I already know she is going to go ask Boaz for it in the middle of the night plus the author basically gave away that part of the climax in the prologue (seriously), why do I want to keep reading? Answer: I don't. It got to where I would skip 60 pages at a time, I was so bored, and you know what? I was never lost after doing that. Because nothing happened in between.Hey, you know what I get tired of? Those dark, kind-of-mysterious men who don't say what they're thinking (and won\u2019t even admit it to themselves) just so the plot will stretch out. I understand it's hard, but seriously. If the Boaz guy would have just been willing to have an honest conversation, the story would go like this:Rosa walks into town and sees Boaz guy.\"Hey, Rosa... ummm.... I'm in love with you.\"\"Really? Woah! You know, that's funny because I'm in love with you\"\"DUDE! Do you wanna, like, marry me?\"\"Oh my goodness YES\"\u201cCool! I promise to love you forever.\u201d\u201cOk, me too.\u201dEnd of story.
