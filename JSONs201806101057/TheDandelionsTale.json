No really. I don't want you here. Because this book isn't for you. It's a book for fathers and mothers and daughters and sons and everybody else who has a heart and appreciates a story with a sense of wonder. THE DANDELION'S TALE is heartfelt, poetic, beautifully-drawn, and incredibly poignant. When I finished reading it to my daughter, I had to wipe the tears away.

She lived in Michigan while I lived in California so I didn't get to see her very often. I'm not sure where I got the idea but I knew that everytime I scattered the dandelion's seed pods that I could make a wish and until July 1993 that wish was alway that the seeds would fly all the way to Michigan so that they could at least visit with my Great Grandma. After July 1993 they would have had to traverse an immeasurable distance so I stopped wishng that particular wish. The Dandelion in this tale is the one that wishes to be remembered and Sparrow makes that happen through listening to her story, writing it out, and finally telling it to Dandelion's \"grown up\" seed pods. A gentle story about how life does indeed go on after death.I forgot to mention that I read it to a 5 year old boy today and it was the one he liked best of the three that we read. A few months back I read him The Day Tiger Rose Said Goodbye and he was rather disturbed by it. Maybe because he has a cat so it was a little to close to home? We read a wide variety of books every week and he's a rather good listener at least when it comes to books."}, {"userName": "Lynne", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1324789-lynne", "userReview": "This is one of those lovely, lovely children's books that will find a special place in the heart of many adults.

The story of a sparrow that meets a dandelion that only has lost almost all of her seeds and is worried that no one will remember that she ever existed. The sparrow begins to write her story in the dirt so when people pass by they can read the story of the dandelion. Then a terrible storm comes during the night and the sparrow wants to check on the dandelion but, hard blowing winds prevent that from happening. In the morning the worst has happened and the sparrow feels like he has failed. After a few days the sparrow notices new bursts of yellow in the field. The dandelion's progeny continues to flourish in field and so continues the circle of life.I thought this was a beautifully written story about reaching out to others, providing comfort, and remembering them when they are gone. I like the fact that the author used the dandelion as a protagonist in the story. The dandelion is one of the most reviled weeds and they cause constant headaches to homeowners every year. This author has soften my resolve against the weed, it made me think this weed has a great story to tell. Highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Caryn Caldwell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/125257-caryn-caldwell", "userReview": "The old dandelion knows that once all of its seeds have blown away, it will wither and die and no one will care. A sympathetic sparrow offers to transcribe the dandelion's story in the mud so all may read and remember. But when a heavy storm not only removes the last seeds -- thus killing the dandelion -- but also washes away the story, Sparrow must find a new way to help Dandelion be remembered after death.As the synopsis shows, The Dandelion's Tale is not a light read. It is both uplifting and melancholy at the same time, and it deals with some pretty big issues, such as the fleetingness of life and being remembered after death. For those struggling with such issues -- perhaps those who have recently lost a grandparent or who are questioning the meaning of life -- this might be a good discussion opener, especially when read with an adult. Those looking for a sweet story about a bird and a flower, however, will likely find themselves surprised."}, {"userName": "Renee ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6120471-renee", "userReview": "I thought this was a tender and beautiful picture book exploring the natural cycle of life through a special friendship between a sparrow and a lone dandelion.

A sparrow comes to a tree near the dandelion. Then Sparrow heard some crying and he looked down and saw the dandelion crying. Sparrow came down and was trying to figure out why Dandelion was crying. Dandelion was sad because he was going to lose all of his pods. So to cheer Dandelion up, Sparrow decided that to make sure Dandelion was remembered he would write Dandelion's story down in dirt. So Sparrow went home for the day, but there was a great storm in the area. Sparrow immediately thought of Dandelion. He tried to fly back to him, but the storm was too strong. To find out if Dandelion survived the storm, read this book! I really enjoyed this book because of the great story. The colors are so inviting to children.

The dandelion tells the sparrow that she is sad because she is no longer as strong and yellow as she used to be; she only has ten frail seed pods left. In an effort to make the dandelion feel better, sparrow offers to write down a few of dandelions favorite memories in dirt. The next day a storm washes away the dandelion and the dandelions story in the dirt. Sparrow is overcome with grief, but a few weeks later he sees 10 new, bright, young yellow dandelions in the meadow. He friends these new 10 dandelions and tells them the tale of his friend that has passed away and her memory lives in generations of dandelions to come. Theme \u2013 The major theme of this book is that although you may miss a loved one who passes away, you can cherish and remember him/her by retelling their favorite stories and memories for generations to come. This concept is conveyed as the sparrow shares his favorite memories of the dandelion with the other dandelions. Personal Response \u2013 This story reminds me of when my Grandpa passed away. My family and I were very sad, but we found comfort in talking about him and his favorite things. Telling stories and passing those along to future generations cherishes my grandpa and lets him live on forever in our hearts. This is exactly the case of the dandelion and sparrow; the dandelions tale lives on forever in the hearts of the new dandelions and the sparrow. Recommendation \u2013 I would highly recommend this book to any child who has recently experienced the loss of a loved one. This book helps children understand that a loved one is never truly gone forever because they live in our hearts forever through story telling.

He goes over to the dandelion and asks what's wrong, and she replies that she once was as yellow as the sun, but she has turned white and only has 10 seeds left. The dandelion's one wish is to be remembered, so the sparrow writes her story in the dirt beneath the tree as the dandelion tells him what to write. After the sparrow finishes writing her story in the dirt, he tells her that he'll be back in the morning to read it again, and he flies home. A thunderstorm comes that night, and the next morning, the sparrow finds the dandelion drooped over, and he is very sad. After a little while, the sparrow is flying over the meadow when he sees new dandelions; he goes to talk to them and realizes that there are 10 new dandelions, so dandelion's story has lived on. I really liked this book! The story was very sweet and had a great message! When the sparrow found the 10 new dandelions, my heart melted. The last page of the book said, \"She would always live on in the bright yellow petals of her children, and their children, and so on until the end of time.\" This book could be used in the classroom to talk about friendship; the sparrow and the dandelion became friends because she was alone in the meadow, and then he went on to write her story and tell it to her children. This book would also be a good one to read in the Spring/Summer!"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20390649-karen", "userReview": "Dandelion laments not being the beautiful yellow flower and now only has 10 seedpods left.
