We're entitled to our opinions.''Wrong. This is Texas. And my opinion is the only one that counts.'  \nWhat happens when the most perfect man in the world meets the most imperfect woman? A great story, that's what. \nRe-reading my favorite books, especially series books, is like visiting old friends. Some books are better the fifth time around. I remember walking into a bookstore, seeing This Heart of Mine, opening it, and thinking, 'I will love this book.' It was there that I discovered Chicago Stars series by Susan Elizabeth Phillips. SEP introduced me to romance and I was hooked. Every time I read one of her books, I fall in love again - with the writing style, with the complex and real characters she creates, and with the deeply emotional and hot love scenes. Call Me Irresistible is one of my all time favorite romance books. It weaves together multiple characters from previous Phillips novels. Meg was in What I Did For Love and Glitter Baby, Ted in Fancy Pants and Lady Be Good and we met Lucy in First Lady. The book opens with Lucy and Ted on the verge of marriage... until the bride's best friend Meg shows up. Meg thinks Ted's totally wrong for Lucy and doesn\u2019t hesitate to tell her just that \u2013 one day before the fairytale wedding. Lucy realizes she might be marrying Ted for the wrong reasons and decides to pull a Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride and ditches poor Ted at the altar. Meg becomes the most hated woman in town- a town she's stuck in with a very angry bridegroom.  \u2018If I were going to put a price tag on my lady parts I\u2019d find a more appetizing buyer.\u2019   Meg Koranda.  I\u2019ve always like strong women. Even if they aren\u2019t strong at the beginning of a story they develop into someone who can overcome their challenges and survive. I like to be able to identify with the heroine, which means if she's weak and wimpy, I'm going to hate the book. Meg is a free spirit, rebellious, smart, funny and competent. At the same time she is able to see her own mistakes, and learn from them. She realizes her flaws throughout the book and is the character that has the most heart. Meg is normal and ordinary and has trouble making decisions. She is someone I can relate to. \n  \u2018You\u2019re not company, you\u2019re an infestation.\u2019   Ted Beaudine.  Mr. Perfect. Tall, good looking, intelligent and rich, this guy does what every man wants and he's every woman's dream. But he's much more complex than he first appears. He is undoubtedly one of SEP's best heroes. \n  'I sure do miss that woman. Smart. Funny. Sweet. She never gave me a moment's trouble.''Gosh, I'm sorry about that. I knew it was boring between you two, but not that bad.'  \n  'I\u2019m not the evil bitch everybody\u2019s made me out to be.''I never said you were evil.'  \n  'Come on, Ted. I\u2019m not exactly the type to be a rich man\u2019s bimbo.''That\u2019s true.' A world of compassion softened his voice. 'Bimbos are generally good-hearted women who are pleasant to be around.''Spoken from experience, I\u2019m sure. By the way, you may be God Almighty on the golf course, but you\u2019re a lousy dancer. Let me lead.'  \n\n  'You were my best friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9! And if that\u2019s not good enough, don\u2019t forget that I basically hate you.'He hit her full force with those amber eyes. 'You basically like me, too. Not your fault. It just happened.'  \n\n  The clouds rushed overhead, the thunder rumbled, and a wave of fury caught her in its grip. 'Just the sight of you made me feel like dancing,' she whispered.'Meg . . .''My love is hot!' The words burst from her. 'It\u2019s a burning thing. It boils and churns and runs deep and strong. But all your emotions are cool and spare. You stand on the sidelines where you don\u2019t have to sweat too much. That\u2019s why you wanted to marry Lucy. It was neat. It was logical. Well, I\u2019m not neat. I\u2019m messy and wild and disruptive, and you have broken my heart.'  \n  'I love you, Meg. I want to marry you. I want to sleep with you every night, make love with you, have kids. I want to fight together and work together and\u2014just be together. Now are you going to keep standing there, staring at me, or could you put me out of my misery and say you still love me, at least a little?'  \nSusan's homepage bears the slogan, \"Life's too short to read depressing books\". If you feel the same way then you'll want to take a look at her books."}, {"userName": "\u2665Sharon\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12125670-sharon", "userReview": "You all must think I am a bit crazy reading one SEP book after another but what can I say. Susan Elizabeth Philips just does it for me. Her writing is a bit whimsical and her stories never fail to make me happy. Right from the beginning I always lose myself in the story, fall in love with the characters and all that is going on around them and as I emerge at the end, I always have a stupid grin on my face.Call me Irresistible was no different. I. LOVED. IT! This is Meg Coranda and Ted Beaudine\u2019s story. These two lived their lives so differently. Meg was rather undisciplined and Ted was rather compliant. They knew a little about each other, but had never met. But the big day was finally here. Lucy was marrying Ted and Meg was a bridesmaid. But shortly after Meg arrives she knows Lucy is about to make a big mistake by marrying Ted. Deep down Lucy knew this too. As the wedding begins, Lucy becomes that \u201crunaway bride\u201d making what everyone thinks is the biggest mistake of her life. Everyone thinks Meg is to blame. Poor Meg, it wasn\u2019t a good day for her.\nTed Beaudine ~  he was perfect. Seriously there really wasn\u2019t anything he could do wrong. There wasn\u2019t one thing about him that you wouldn\u2019t fall in love with. He was handsome, sweet, sexy, kind, brilliant and simply amazing. But so was Lucy, or at least the life she had settled in. They fit together but then they didn\u2019t. When things fell apart he handled it was such grace and composure. But his feathers were about to get ruffled. Meg would be the one to make him lose control and be a little reckless. \nMeg Coranda ~ she was perfect too. Not in the traditional way but in her own way. She was floating through life with no real sense of direction. She could have it all, the beautiful home, the perfect husband and all the material things every woman wanted. But she was still searching for that one thing she wanted to do, the thing that would make her the happiest. She stumbled upon that one thing while being in Wynette, Texas trying to come out from under a black cloud that settled over her. What she hadn\u2019t expected to find was the one person that would make her settle\u2026..to make her want a home.\nMaking this home and grabbing hold of what was making her happy wouldn\u2019t be an easy task. The people of Wynette wanted the best for their Teddy. He deserved the perfect woman and in their eyes that had been Lucy and Meg was to blame for what went wrong.\nSome of the ladies were not nice at all. Women can be such bitches. Birdie, Haley and Kayla did whatever they could to make Meg miserable. Francesca and Lady Emma were not too far behind but they had more class. Torie was the one to saddle up alongside Meg giving her the nudges she needed to stand her ground. Meg wouldn\u2019t give in or give up.\nBut Meg was like this little yellow chick. She was trying to fit in where no one really wanted her. Ted wanted her though. They were both falling for each other. One was falling in love and the other was falling into something. Their passion and desire was apparent but would it be enough. Ted\u2019s control would be tested in a way it had never been tested and Meg would finally make the decision to settle and no longer be that wanderer. What would come of these two? Are these words said before it is too late?"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6972914-karen", "userReview": "5 STARSI\u2019m going to make this short and sweet. SENSATIONAL. Pure SEP gold\u2026 as I\u2019ve come to expect it now. I have yet to give her less than full marks on any of her books. This one takes us back to good ole Wynette, Texas, and all of the folks that go along with it. And yes\u2026 the one and only\u2026Ted Beaudine. The devastatingly handsome only son and boy genius of the world famous golf champion, Dallas Beaudine and his equally famous and exquisitely beautiful wife, Francesca Day Beaudine. This guy is perfect in every way. Every woman who meets him falls in love with him. Pre-teens crush on him. Old ladies fawn over him. Even the birds sing in his presence and halos of light follow his gorgeous profile. His genius IQ has him saving the environment from the car he drives to the home he lives in. He\u2019s so well known and loved in his home town of Wynette, that they elected him Mayor. \n\n\u201cHe sounds like Jesus. Except rich and sexy.\u201d \u201cWatch it, Meg. In this town joking about Jesus could get you shot. You\u2019ve never seen so many of the faithful who\u2019re armed.\u201d\n\nAnd just in case that isn\u2019t enough, his lovemaking skills are a thing of legend. Completely unselfish. His mouth and hands perform magic on the female form like he was born to please. He never gets upset, and his good deeds know no bounds.And Lucy Jorik is about to marry him. How she landed this perfect male specimen she\u2019ll never understand. But everyone says they\u2019re perfect together. So why did she leave him at the alter during their highly publicized wedding. The only one who understood what she was feeling was her best friend, Meg Koranda. The daughter of Hollywood royalty, Meg\u2019s life was mess. She\u2019d dropped out of college, she\u2019d traveled to foreign lands, sought adventure at every corner of the earth, and completely fucked up her life. And, now she was fucking up Lucy\u2019s as well.At least that\u2019s how everyone else saw it\u2026 After Lucy disappears, she left Meg to clean up the mess she left behind in Wynette. And Meg found herself trapped in a town that hated her. No friends, no money, and no family to dig her out of this colossal disaster. And then there is the wrath of Ted.\n\nNo wonder he was a legend. He knew exactly how to drive a woman to her maximum sexual pleasure. So why was she so disappointed.\n\nI absolutely LOVED Meg\u2019s character. She was tough, quick witted, and completely comfortable in her own skin. Even when she\u2019d lost everything, she\u2019d just suck it up, hold her head up high, and do what she had to do to survive. \n\n\u201cCome on, Ted. I\u2019m not exactly the type to be a rich man\u2019s bimbo.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d A world of compassion softened his voice. \u201cBimbos are generally good-hearted women who are pleasant to be around.\u201d\u201cSpoken from experience, I\u2019m sure. By the way, you may be God Almighty on the golf course, but you\u2019re a lousy dancer. Let me lead.\u201d \n\nThere were so many hilariously funny scenes in this book, and just as many touching ones.The entire Wynette clan was present in full force, so it will be much better if you\u2019ve read the series in order. \n\n\u201cThis is America. We\u2019re entitled to our opinions.\u201d\u201cWrong. This is Texas. And my opinion is the only one that counts.\u201d \n\nSo many fabulous quotes, and the supporting characters were just fantastic. The final showdown is epic, with the whole town present for the fall of their town hero. There was a epilogue with a lovely HEA. I loved everything about the book. Ok\u2026 I guess this wasn\u2019t as short and sweet as I\u2019d intended. Sorry. :)\n\n \u201cThe sooner we get through this, the sooner I can strip you naked, lose my self control, and humiliate myself again.\u201d\n\n Enjoy the book. I\u2019m on to Wynette #7.

If you are a heavy enough GR user, you know who the people are in every group\u2014 It\u2019s funny to read the reviews of romance books that primarily lit fic readers write. It\u2019s also funny to read the reviews of, well, more complicated reads done by people who do not usually venture into those realms. That\u2019s why I am a fan of Vinaya\u2019s \u201ccomparative 5 stars\u201d shelf\u2026but not enough of a fan to go through all my books and change all my ratings. At least for me, there are some books that I rate 4 or 5 stars that might not get the same rating when compared to books in other genres but that definitely stand out amongst their direct competitors. However, there are obviously always those that will hold their own against even the most nitpicky readers. Anyway, I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips books. Compared to other books in her genre, she is consistent in her plotwork and writing. I know that I will laugh at her jokes, fall for several characters (not necessarily in a romantic sense, just that I root for them) and get some reassurances that I\u2019ll be able to figure everything out in my life, like why I can never figure out a third item for lists I write.This book might not appeal to those who haven\u2019t read and enjoyed other SEP books, specifically Fancy Pants (Gah, that title, I know) and Lady Be Good. Her series books tend to be massively self-referential, which can be enjoyable if you remember all the characters and storylines from her other books but I think it might/probably would hinder the enjoyment of those who are unfamiliar with her earlier work. Characters also show up from Glitter Baby, What I Did For Love, and First Lady. Another point we discussed at book club was whether or not we enjoyed authors who set several books in the same world despite them not really being a series. (In case anyone is wondering, our book club pick was The Windup Girl, whose author has written several other stories in the same world.) Feelings ran the gamut from love to author laziness. In the case of romance series, I appreciate the little glimpses we get into the lives of characters after their particular romantic stories have been told, but sometimes I get sick of reading about the \u201ccouple that is still head over heels who are still having wild sex and have several perfect children and perfect lives.\u201d (*cough*Nora Roberts *cough*)This book was a little too heavy on the \"Look! Those other characters are still in love!\" but I still loved reading about Ted and Meg falling for each other.The story in Call Me Irresistable felt (maybe too) similar to Ain\u2019t She Sweet. Main female character that people believe is too entitled? Check. Made to work at a job that might be considered beneath her but she scrapes by and maintains her dignity and honor? Check. And she is ridiculed and made to feel unwelcome by the townspeople? Check. While the male romantic interest is a guy whose life she arguably ruined? Check. He treats her like dirt? Check. Until they fall in love? Check. Uh oh.But I gave it four stars! That\u2019s right, and I am sticking to my guns. I don\u2019t care that it wasn\u2019t very original. All I care about is that when I laid in my bed to go to sleep and picked this book up, I didn\u2019t put it down until it was done."}, {"userName": "Mo", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11856352-mo", "userReview": "Did a quick re-read in preparation for the next book of the series.

I don't know whether it's the humor, the witty dialogue, or the way you have to suspend reality and just immerse yourself in the story and get out of it feeling lighter with a goofy grin on your face. That's exactly how I felt after reading this book. On paper, this is as far away from \"realistic romance\" as you can get. Not everyone happens to be the child of a supermodel and a famous actor/director or the child of a famous television personality and a golf champion. That alone should me hate the characters and I shouldn't be able to relate to them at all, right? And yet, I loved every single moment of it. Despite their elevated statuses as children of celebrities, I felt that SEP captured their insecurities, hurts, flaws and made it into a great love story. \nI loved both Meg and Ted. They are total opposites of each other but at the same time, they are also similar. They are both children of celebrities and they have to live under the shadow of their great parents. Meg isn't your typical heroine in that she was described as spoiled and irresponsible. I should have hated her but SEP just has this knack of making me like heroines like Meg. I truly did love Meg. She was witty and irrepressible and the way her character grew from being this aimless, irresponsible woman-child into a confident woman was just wonderful to watch. I was rooting for her all the way. Ted was also a wonderful hero. Like many of SEP's heroes, he started off as a real jerk and very calculating. Although, it's truly understandable considering his fiancee left him at the altar but still, his treatment of Meg at first was odious. Even when he started treating her well, there was still this doubt in my mind about how sincere he was about Meg. But in the end, he had this epic epiphany of sorts which led to one epic groveling complete with a grand gesture that made me happy. \nLoved the secondary characters. Not many authors especially in romance can write such vivid and interesting secondary characters. Sometimes they just fade into the woodwork unless there's a book planned for them. But in this book, the secondary characters were wonderfully written. Another SEP winner for me. Definitely recommended for readers who love their HEA. And the epilogue was just right. Nothing too sappy or overdone.

Very enjoyable. I didn\u2019t want to stop reading. Fun escape.REVIEWER\u2019S OPINION:The author used a similar plot in several books. Heroine is down on her luck, in an unfriendly place, abandoned by family/friends, has no money. The locals bully, despise and/or humiliate her. She suffers, discovers things about herself, becomes responsible/successful, and finds love. If a reader complains that they\u2019ve read this before, I say \u201cWho cares. It\u2019s a fun story and she does it well.\u201dThe first time I read this I was uncomfortable seeing favorite characters from earlier books being mean to Meg. But the second time I read this that didn\u2019t bother me at all - maybe because I knew they would all like her in the end. And the same thing with Ted\u2019s feelings. The first time I read the book, I wanted more of his point of view. But the second time I read it, I was fine with what happened. This book is better the second time.PRIOR BOOKS:I suggest reading the author\u2019s books in the following order for the character flow.5 stars. Glitter Baby. Fleur is a beautiful model living a glamorous life, then has nothing, and then brings herself back to the world, developing brains, strength and relationships along the way. She marries famous actor/playwright Jake. Meg is their daughter who is now 30 and the heroine in this book. Meg\u2019s best friend is Lucy.5 stars. Fancy Pants. Francesca is a rich English girl, whose mother dies leaving her penniless and stranded in the U.S. She gets a job as a cleaning lady for a small town radio station. She marries famous golfer Dallas. Ted is their son, the hero in this book.5 stars. Lady Be Good. Emma is headmistress of a girls\u2019 boarding school in England. She visits the U.S. for two weeks and meets Kenny, a famous bad boy golfer. They marry and live in Wynette, Texas. They are friends with Francesca, Dallas, and Ted.5 stars. First Lady. Cornelia is wife of the U.S. President who dies in office. She meets and marries Matt Jorik a journalist. They adopt orphan Lucy. Cornelia later becomes President. Lucy is now 31 and is engaged to marry Ted in this book. Meg is Lucy\u2019s best friend.4 stars. The Great Escape Lucy Jorik leaves Ted at the altar and runs away. She sees a stranger on a motorcycle Patrick Shade \u201cPanda.\u201d She asks him for a ride. Read this right after First Lady since Lucy has a significant role in both books.STORY BRIEF:Ted is close to perfect, handsome, genius IQ, everyone in town loves him. They made him mayor without asking him. Most females fall in love with him. He is engaged to marry Lucy, daughter of the former U.S. President.Meg has never had a job, dropped out of college, and travels the world for fun. Her famous parents recently cut her off financially, hoping she will become responsible. Meg travels to Wynette, Texas, to be Lucy\u2019s maid of honor. Meg raises some questions which cause Lucy to realize she is not in love. Lucy abandons Ted at the altar and wants Meg to do the explaining. Everyone in town blames Meg, thinking she talked Lucy out of the wedding. Lucy left town, and no one knows where she is. As Meg is checking out of the hotel, she realizes her credit cards have been cancelled. She doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay the hotel. She has over borrowed from everyone she knows, and there is no one she can call. The police chief threatens to put her in jail if she can\u2019t pay her hotel bill. Ted suggests she work it off as a hotel maid, which she does. She is sleeping in her car and has no money for food.Spencer owns a plumbing company. He is looking for a location to open a factory and visits Wynette. The town desperately needs jobs, and everyone in town hopes he will choose Wynette for the factory. Spencer wants to be Meg\u2019s lover and sugar daddy. She does not feel the same and tries to avoid him. Most people in town dislike Meg and have been mean to her, but they want her to be nice to Spencer to get his factory.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Shannon Cochran was pretty good doing this book. But she was awful doing \u201cThe Great Escape\u201d (TGE). In TGE she used a weird chipmunk type of voice for many characters. In the beginning of this book CMI she used that weird voice twice: once for Matt Jorik and once for Dallie Beaudine. But after that the narrator didn\u2019t use the weird voice much. I was ok with most of the rest of the book.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Story length: 385 pages. Swearing language: moderate, including religious swear words. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: 10. Setting: current day mostly Wynette, Texas, with some California and New York. Copyright: 2011.

And by that I mean specifically the last 4 sentences.5 stars for this one because I couldn't put it down and I really became consumed by the story. It's been a long time since I've read a great book like this. SEP's better books are charming and hilarious but also a bit heart breaking. The storylines are dense and the characters are multi-dimensional, often making them annoying at times.This was one of SEP's better books. And I haven't read one of her better books in a long time. The last book she released (ages ago) wasn't very strong in my opinion, and a lot of her other amazing books I read in a cluster all at once years ago. So it's nice to read some new, great material.I HATED Ted in the beginning, that only grew to a mild acceptance of him. I didn't dislike him because he's a brat and treats Meg like garbage, his actions sort of add to Meg's allure in how she deals with him and it did build an interesting sort of chemesty. To be honest, I never took to the wunder-child in other books, and that's really the bud of my dislike for him. I appreciated his role in Fancy Pants, but was unimpressed by his older self in Lady Be Good. I didn't read this book for Ted, I read it for Meg. I liked the glimpses of Meg we saw in What I Did for Love, but even more so, I liked what was going on with Meg in the preview chapter that was released for this book. That's what made me excited for the read.Meg does not disappoint. I found her utterly charming and lovely right from the beginning. I once watched an interview where SEP says that her heroines are strong but that we might not always like them right from the beginning (cough-Francesca,-Fluer,-and-the-main-character-from-kiss-an-angelr-cough) but that wasn't the case with Meg. I loved her. Love love love! She could have really wallowed in deserved self pity, but she doesn't. And she is absolutely hilarious. I had to put the book down to relive reading, \"She made a grand gesture toward the recliner. 'I\u2019ve taken a new lover. Sorry you had to find out like this.'\" in regards to moving in with Skeet. That's my type of humour. She's was a really well written character. Plus she spoke to me. I'm not in her shoes in many respects, but I am trying to find my 'passion' and figure out my 'calling'. So I could relate to her all-over-the-place-ness.Love love love love LOVED Meg! Can't say the same for Ted or for a lot of the old characters that pop up in this book, but that might just be what makes it good. The story stirred up so many feelings and opinions. I really became passionate about those opinions I held. That type of interaction doesn't happen often from reading romances (at least not for me).In the end: the storyline was great, Meg was magnificent, and even though the romance left a bit to be desired (i.e. no hot romance/sex scenes, no amazing declarations that really just hit the spot, sort of clumsy interactions from the conceded hero), this books was fabulous.In my opinion, this book was a lot better than 'What I Did For Love' and probably as strong as favourites from the Chicago series and other gems from SEP's classics.I'll be re-reading some of my fav. SEP books over the next while (not including Lady Be Good, because I reread that while reading this to refresh who Torie was)."}, {"userName": "Christina ~ Brunette Reader", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19958389-christina-brunette-reader", "userReview": "Top form SEP writing about what I think she writes best: opposites attract. A runaway bride-to-be brings Wynette's golden boy and role model Ted Beaudine and bohemian outsider Meg Koranda together in a whirlwind of unexpected attraction, golf and small town intrigues.Just one complaint, taking away a full star though, the fact that, unlike what usually happens in her books, Ted's pov is totally absent until the very final chapters and his actions and motivations annoyingly appear to always come out of the blue, leaving what felt like half of the romance (and the fun) out.

While this installment is its very own story, it features many characters from the other books in the series. I found these additions to be an unexpected but extremely entertaining treat. Call Me Irresistible was a fun but somewhat complicated story about the woes of finding Mr. Irresistible. Our heroine Meg quickly learns that being with the \"perfect\" guy isn't all it's cracked up to be. Ms. Phillips dismisses more than that dream in this book though. Other envious situations tackled include the burden of being a town hero and the downside of being raised by rich and famous parents. As always, Ms. Phillips writes humor and romance like nobody's business. If you haven't read anything by her then just pick any random one and get started. You'll love it!My favorite quote:\"Sometimes change is what we need. I guess it lets us look at our lives in a new way.\"The Wynette, Texas series contains the following installments as of February 2016. In my opinion, they can each be read in any order as standalone novels.#1-Fancy Pants#2-Lady Be Good#3-Glitter Baby#4-First Lady#4.5-My Secret Service Valentine#5-What I Did for Love#6-Call Me Irresistible#7-The Great Escape"}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3820197-jill", "userReview": "Lucy Jorik is getting married. To the most irresistible man in the world, Ted Beaudine. Meg Koranda, Lucy's best friend and bridesmaid is certain Lucy is doing the wrong thing. In Meg's opinion these two perfect people are not meant for each other. Caring for Lucy as she does, she advises her not to marry Ted. And Lucy agrees. She's known for a while that maybe Ted and her are not meant to be. So when Lucy finally pulls out of the wedding - at the church - the people of the small town of Wynette, Texas soon find out who's to blame for breaking the heart of their favourite son.Unfortunately Meg is unable to leave Hicksville, USA having no money and no resources. To earn enough to leave she is forced to stay and work under the openly hostile glare of the locals and the cool appraisal of one Ted Beaudine.I don't read too many contemporaries. In my opinion they are the hardest sub-genre of romance to write and pull off well. In romantic suspense there is always the action and thrill of the chase. Historicals can be filled with details of costumes and rigid social mores. Fantasy, sci-fi and paranormals can create entire new worlds and species to hold readers' interest.But how can you sustain a 300-400 page read with everyday 21st century life? Contemporaries usually have to be character-driven. And salted liberally with humour for me to be able to swallow. And this is what SEP does well. Really well. She can take the most ordinary town and banal situation and make it entertaining. Plumped out with intelligent humour, quirky side characters, lively banter and voila. A SEP novel.Call Me Irresistible is another great read by the Incomparable SEP."}, {"userName": "Sarah MacLean", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/216457-sarah-maclean", "userReview": "Perfect, perfect SEP.

Meg had it rough at the beginning of this one but I liked how she took control of her life. I wasn't so sure about Ted in the beginning. He treated Meg kinda rough at first. Although, seeing as how he blamed her for ruining his wedding to Lucy I can see why. However, Ted definitely improved on me.There was definitely some great love scenes in this book.

But then I was chatting with some of my GR friends about this, all of us anticipating this book. At this point I thought, huh, maybe I should check out what this one will be about. After reading the blurb, I expected to hate this one. I really loved the idea of Ted and Lucy together. They are some of my favorite characters from earlier books, precocious kids that had so much promise as adults. Meg, has never been a character that I really liked, I more felt ambivalent about her, but her seemingly a home wrecker, made me start out hating her before even picking up the book. So with those thoughts in my head, I picked up this book to read while I was watching some DVD's today. It didn't take long before I was sucked into the story. And horrors of all horrors, when I was done watching the DVD's I kept reading this one instead of, gasp..... wait for it....... finishing the last 40 pages of Shadowfever, I just had to know how this one ended.Even with her actions I really liked Lucy, I thought what she did had taken great courage, not sure that I could have done the same thing. I didn't like Meg until about halfway through. All I saw was the spoiled woman that she was. It took seeing her at rock bottom and building herself back up before I started to change my mind. I loved how she took on all of these crazy townspeople and turned their own antics back on them.With Ted I went through many different feelings, many of them mirroring what Meg felt. When Meg was getting her bearings, I hated Ted with her. He had a way to twist his surroundings to suit him making them not at all what it looked like. But slowly as Ted started to let his real self show, he redeemed himself in my eyes.Meg and Ted's growing relationship was fun. They not only had to fight their own feelings, but the whole towns opinion as well. With everyone putting in their 2 cents it made for a mad house. And we must mention all those crazy townspeople. As a collective they are a character in themselves. Many of them we have met in previous books, so if you want to check this book out, and you should, it is best to read all of her older books for a more through understanding.

With that disclaimer out there....I really liked Call Me Irresistible. The book is rated 4 stars because she has written some of my all time favorites (Kiss an Angel, Heaven, Texas, Glitter Baby and Nobody's Baby but Mine) which set the bar for my *5* stars. Call Me Irresistible wasn't quite up to par with my fav's, but it is definitely SEP and therefore COMPLETELY worth your time.Here's what I loved:1. This was like a huge reunion of characters that spans several of SEP's former books. Characters from Glitter Baby, First Lady, Lady Be Good, and Fancy Pants are given significant page time and I loved reconnecting with the couples from SEP's former books.2. Meg Koranda was a classic SEP heroine. She's a \"down on her luck\" heroine who makes lemonade when life throws her lemons. I really liked Meg. She is someone who you'd like to know and that makes her a very special character.3. The ending and epilogue. SEP specializes in some of the most memorable endings I've ever read, and Call Me Irresistible definitely has one of these endings.4. Ted Beaudine....but only towards the very end.Here's what I disliked:1. Ted Beaudine. I know I'm contradicting myself here...but it's the truth. SEP does not allow the reader into Ted's mind until the very end, so his motives and feeling are kept hidden. I really did not connect with his character at all until the end when it was almost too late. Emphasis on \"almost\". When Ted decides to let us in to his mind and all the walls come down...it is a sight to be hold!Here's what I missed:1. There is no secondary romance in this book. In this book, the only romance is Ted and Meg's. I found myself missing the secondary romance which SEP does so well.Overall, such a joy to read. I recommend this one and it can be read as a \"stand alone\", but with SEP's talent you'd be missing a lot if you don't fill in the blanks with her backlist and read them all!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Scott", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1501042-elizabeth-scott", "userReview": "How have I not heard of Susan Elizabeth Phillips?

Lucy was A-OK with it! it really is funny. then falling in love when Meg knew she was just a bootie call. whew. that\u2019s one extra big luggage to carry, dear.Meg:a very lovable character. but i didn\u2019t like it when she can defend other peeps when someone steps on them but not herself. especially when her family is the one doing the stepping on her. i believe that it is done for her benefit (to grow up, take a job and make something out of her life) but it is rather harsh. nevertheless, she did grew up. she\u2019s been changing for the better now but i don\u2019t see why she often pretend to be the same happy-go-lucky girl to everyone when she\u2019s no longer that girl anymore. pity party, perhaps?Teddy:who doesn\u2019t love him? oh, i do! he\u2019s a prick who pretends to be a saint. and how the whole town worships him! and yet i liked it when he responds to Meg\u2019s antics in such an un-saintly way. so the he is not perfect, after all!ultimate high experience:the bootie calls, of course! the author sizzled it with humor and romance all in one plate. wow. it never failed to make me laugh so hard, then go mushy all of a sudden.

Any book that can wring all those emotions out of me gets the 5 star review.Meg Koranda ventures to Wynette Texas for the wedding of her best friend Luck Jorik to Ted Beaudine. It doesn\u2019t take long for Meg to stir things up, but really she was just being truthful when she told her best friend that she shouldn\u2019t marry the God of Wynette, Mr. Perfect himself Ted Beaudine. So when Lucy leaves poor Ted at the alter and makes a quick get away, everyone in town is looking for someone to blame and poor Meg is right in the crosshairs. The town of Wynette sure can hold a grudge.Meg may be the daughter of two very rich and famous people, but since they cut off her access to the family funds, she\u2019s been trying to make ends meet on her own. With a hundred bucks to her name and no way to pay her hotel bill or support herself, Meg plans on making her own quick get away before the good folks of Wynette can lynch her for ruining the wedding of the century. Meg barely makes it to the city limits before the police are hot on her tail and threatening to put her in jail and leading the charge is none other than Mr. Perfect himself Ted Beaudine. I loved Meg. She showed remarkable resilience, determination and a profound sense of loyalty to work her way out of her current predicament. I thought she got the raw end of the deal when the close nit people of Wynette turned on her - but they would do anything to protect their favorite son. With no money, no friends, no family to support her, I couldn\u2019t help but feel for Meg as she was forced to clean bathrooms, go without food and showers and live in her car while she attempted to work off her debt. How can you not feel for the girl? Ted Beaudine is perfect - literally. Birds sing when he goes outside and when the sun shines on him, it looks like he\u2018s wearing a halo. He never gets mad or displays a negative emotion. He is the town saviour. All the women love him, the men respect him and all the hopes and dreams for the town are riding on Ted\u2019s shoulders. That\u2019s a big burden for one mortal man to carry! So it\u2019s no wonder the folks of Wynette rallied around him when his bride left him at the alter. The only one who didn\u2019t seem all that broken up over his failed marriage was Ted himself.I wasn\u2019t sure how Meg and Ted were ever going to be able to have any kind of relationship given the town\u2019s animosity towards her and the fact that Ted had been set to marry her best friend just a few weeks ago. Meg was the only women around for miles who didn\u2019t practically become catatonic every time Ted was in sight and she certainly challenged Ted at every opportunity. What started out as outright mistrust and anger at each other, to agreeing to use each other to their mutual benefit, SEP developed their relationship slowly and believably. I laughed - the golf caddying scenes were hilarious. I got choked up at Meg\u2019s incredibly forgiving attitude toward the people of Wynette who had shown her nothing but their distain and hostility. She could have blown them and their precious chance to obtain a lucrative new golf course out of the water on more than one occasion and she didn\u2018t. Meg showed her true character when she could have ruined many lives and she took the high road.

Then using the Perfect Human Creator 3000 we will create a perfect clone of Ted. He will be the next Messiah and will bless us with his wisdom and hotness. Forever!If I could go back in time and slap my past self over the head for having those expectations regarding Call Me Irresistible I would.Saying that I\u2019m disappointed by this book would be an understatement. What the hell was this story? Can someone please tell me? What the hell happened to Ted? Nah, let's not call him Ted. New Jesus (a halo?? Really??)? Nah, too good. Mayor Dickhead? Perfect. So what happened to Mayor Dickhead? He was such a cute kid in whatever, the previous books \u2013 forgot the names. And now he\u2019s freakin\u2019 Medusa\u2019s blow up doll. Hard-headed, heartless and boring as hell.Did I mention that he\u2019s a total asshole to Meg? Let me quote the dear ass:\n He pointed one long finger in the general direction of her head. \u201cYou\u2019d better be ready at seven on Friday night because that\u2019s when I\u2019m picking you up. And don\u2019t expect to see me before then because I have business in Santa Fe. And I\u2019m not calling, either. I have more important things to do than argue with a crazy woman.\u201d\nMeg, the only character I respect, gets treated like a stray dog throughout the book by Mayor Dickhead and his town of minions. My message to all you mindless pricks is the followingWe also have a reunion in this book. A huge amount of characters from the previous Wynette books are here. And they all are either ignorant, cruel, total bitches or assholes. All those wonderful characters I used to love are gone. Poof! Just like that. One book and all my respect is gone.Aaand, what else do we have? *scratches her chin* Oh yeah! Golf. Want to know my opinion on golf? I\u2019ll quote my good friend George Carlin on this one.\n Plenty of good land in nice neighborhoods, land that is currently being wasted on a meaningless, mindless activity engaged in primarily by white, well-to-do male businessmen who use the game to get together to make deals to carve this country up a little finer among themselves.It is an arrogant game on its very design alone. Just the design of the game speaks of arrogance. Think of how big a golf course is. The ball is that fucking big! What do these pinheaded pricks need with all that land? There are over 17,000 golf courses in America. They average over 150 acres apiece. That's 3 million plus acres, 4,820 square miles. You could build two Rhode Islands and a Delaware for the homeless, on the land currently being wasted on this meaningless, mindless, arrogant, elitist, racist - there's another thing: the only blacks you'll find in country clubs are carrying trays - and a boring game. Boring game for boring people. Have you ever watched golf on television? It's like watching flies fuck.And a mindless game, mindless. Think of the intellect it must take to draw pleasure from this activity: hitting a ball with a crooked stick, and then walking after it! And then, hitting it again! I say, \"Pick it up asshole, you're lucky you found the fucking thing. Put it in your pocket and go the fuck home, you're a winner. You're a winner. You found it!\"\n\u2018Nuff said.Lucy\u2019s story seems like loads of fun. I mean Panda?? Really?? Who the hell goes around calling himself Panda??Oh wait."}, {"userName": "KarenH", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2609870-karenh", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book because I enjoy SEP's sense of humor and how she can take two people who are total opposites and make their relationship work so well. However, I had two problems with this book:***SPOILER***1 - I didn't care for the heroine, Meg Koranda, at all. She meets her best friend Lucy's fiance, Ted, at the wedding rehearsal...is totally rude to him and then basically works on the niggling doubt Lucy supposedly has about marrying him and convinces Lucy not to go through with it. Funny that, since Meg ends up falling for Ted and calls Lucy to ask her permission to sleep with him. I don't buy into best friends sharing a man, even if the first woman is \"totally\" over him. (Is that realistic? Could a woman go from being one step away from marrying a man she thought she loved, and then one month later tell her best friend \"Sure, go ahead and sleep with him...he's the most wonderful lover you will ever have.\" I doubt it.) ***End of SPOILER***2- The citizens of the town of Wynette. If you liked Francesca from \"Fancy Pants\" and/or Emma from \"Lady Be Good\", hold tight to those memories because they aren't very likable this time around. They fit right in with the other women in Wynette...catty, rude and hell bent on intruding in Ted's life to the point that Ted really needed to grow a pair and tell them all to just \"f*k off\" and mind their own business.With that said, it was still nice to hear from SEP again. Although CMI doesn't quite rank up there with her Chicago Stars series, it is written in the same quirky, light-hearted manner that has garnered her so many devoted fans. Best of all, the ending in this book is one of those where you don't know whether to laugh or cry...and end up doing both at once. Classic SEP!"}, {"userName": "Anica", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/136120-anica", "userReview": "LOVE!!!Seriously, this book is everything what I love about SEP! *sigh*I have to say I wasn't that thrilled when I first found out that this book was of Ted and Meg. And Lucy. I dunno it just sounded not that interesting. Oh man, I was so wrong. I practically inhaled all the pages, I just couldn't put it away. ;) I mean the beginning is a bit hard to get into but as soon as Meg and Ted interact together, the story gets interesting.What I love about SEP is her fab writing style. Funny, witty dialogues, but also drama. And her characters are so very well-written. Amazing! I loved Meg. I loved Ted, even if he was a jerk but you get why he behaved that way. At least when you finished it. But really, so very great. And all the supporting characters. Aww. It was so nice to see them together, like Kenny or Torie and Dex. Aww. And even Dallie and Francie who made me smile a lot (especially since their book was one of the worst I've read from SEP). Anyway, I was smiling, laughing and felt for the characters. Such an incredible story how Mr. Cool/Superstar and Miss Chaos fell in love with each other. The ending is fucking brilliant and I still smile like an idiot. Seriously, I know I sound lame but this book was just perfection!Love. Love.

We\u2019re entitled to our opinions.\u201d\u201cWrong. This is Texas. And my opinion is the only one that counts.\u201dNo real spoilers here but quite a few of my favorite quotes.Call Me Irresistible is Ted Beaudine\u2019s book. Ted (Fancy Pants & Lady Be Good) is all grown up and the ultimate catch. Good looks, money, famous parents, and a high IQ. Ted is getting married to Lucy Jorik (First Lady). But Lucy\u2019s best friend, Meg Koranda (Glitter Baby & What I Did For Love) doesn\u2019t like what she sees in Ted and feels Lucy deserves better. So Meg, unintentionally, stops the wedding and Lucy hightails it out of town. Meg tries to follow but circumstances have slowed her getaway. Her parents, tired of waiting for her to grow up and become responsible, have cut her off. That leaves Meg broke, homeless, and the most hated person in town. Enter the residents of Wynette.They completely blame Meg for breaking up Ted and Lucy\u2019s wedding and are determined to make Meg pay. And pay she does. But Meg is made of sterner stuff. After all...she IS the offspring of the famous Glitter Baby. So Meg takes everything and then some that the town dishes out so she can get home. Now all she has to do is resist Mr. Irresistible. But that\u2019s easier said then done.I have been a HUGE fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips for years. My first foray into her world was Fancy Pants. In Fancy Pants we meet the parents of Mr. Irresistible and learn how they came together. In later books, the Beaudine\u2019s make appearances and we watch Teddy grow up. I was thrilled when I found out that Teddy, or Ted as he is called now, got his own book. Following her previous sets ups, we are once again transported to Wynette, Texas (which I\u2019m convinced is actually inhabited by aliens because these people are above board hilariously strange).Ted and the town do their best to make Meg pay for ruining his wedding. From almost getting arrested to being forced to play \u201cnice\u201d with a potential town investor, Meg has her hands full trying to survive from day to day. As Meg integrates herself into the town and becomes mildly accepted (which is not a compliment by the way) she begins to see that Ted is indeed irresistible. But Ted holds back emotionally and she wants all of him or nothing at all. When mild harassment turns to danger for Meg, Ted\u2019s rigid control finally breaks and his world begins to race out of control.He had gone wild and she wanted to race into the unknown with him. He was a fallen angel, consumed by darkness, and he took no care with her at all.The characters of this story do a fabulous jov of keeping you laughing and groaning throughout the story. Well written with an abundance of personality and wit; you find yourself sinking deeper into their lives and becoming heavily invested in their outcomes. Filled with human flaws, Ms. Phillip\u2019s characters are real and react as you or I might. The well plotted storyline entertains and exhilarates as the conversational style dialogue keeps the book flowing smoothly and has you thanking your lucky stars these people don\u2019t live next door to you.Francine Beaudine says it best:\u201cDid you know Ted was nine years old the first time he came to Wynette? Can you imagine how many of the local peculiarities he\u2019d have picked up if he lived here from birth?\u201dI adored Meg from the first time I met her. Even if she is a screw up, her personality and exploits are hilarious and her gift of snark endeared her to me. Everything Meg does is from the heart and that is apparent from the beginning. You\u2019d expect her to lay down in the face of everyone anger but her true nature takes hold and soon she pulls her self up and out from beneath the town and Ted\u2019s thumb. Watching her grow in self respect & assurance is a joy to watch and had me doing quite a few \u201cfist pumps\u201d. She just needed to learn that she is every bit as glamorous and important as her parents.Ted is an enigma. He comes across as the perfect man. Heralded for his business sense, looks, and talents in bed, you can find nothing wrong with him.\u201cLucy neglected to mention that you\u2019re also the mayor of Wynette...in addition to being its patron saint.He\u2019s a people pleaser, but like Meg, you don\u2019t see any real emotions from him. In the beginning, I didn\u2019t like him very much. Some of his actions come to light and his blas\u00e9 attitude disgusted me. But as I got to know him, I sensed that there was far more to him then what you see. It\u2019s only really towards the end that the real Ted breaks through and you hear, in his own words, how he\u2019s felt since the beginning. It\u2019s an emotional outpouring that moved me. I did feel though that the story and his characters would have been better served by allowing more of his POV to be seen.He wanted to make her smile. Laugh. Make her love him again as deeply as he loved her.The chemistry between Meg and Ted is apparent from the beginning but the romance is slow going. Ms. Phillips lets them realistically fall in love through out the entire book. Watching these two snark at each other, I learned exactly what the phase, \u201cHate is merely the flip side of love,\u201d really means.How could Ted and I have a future? He\u2019s the Lamb of God and I\u2019m the town bad girl.Two things about this book bothered me. One was Lucy. She ran away and left Meg to handle the fall out. I would have liked to have seen more of her then what we did. The other problem I had was how Ms. Phillips chose to humiliate Meg. This is a common theme in her books; usually deserved because the heroine is either phenomenally selfish and self absorbed or like Meg, needs a kick in the pants to grow up and accept the responsibility of their actions. But there were times when the humiliation went too far and went from being funny to cruel. Many times I wanted to reach through the book and pop someone hard in the head for some of the things they did to her.The ending is predictable but the path to it is emotional. Ms. Phillips never gives her hero and heroine an easy HEA and you find your self crossing your fingers and toes as you watch these two stumble through some pitfalls.Call Me Irresistible is a hilarious, riotous, engaging romantic contemporary that will have you laughing, crying, and begging for more once the last page is read. I look forward to the next one in this series which is Lucy\u2019s story-currently untitled.Rating: B"}], "description": "The funniest love story of the year, Call Me Irresistible is the book Susan Elizabeth Phillips fans have been craving.
