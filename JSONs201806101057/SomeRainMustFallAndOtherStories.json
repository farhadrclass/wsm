I'm a great fan of The Crimson Petal and the White and The Book of Strange New Things and after Faber transported me to strange new worlds with each new novel, I was curious where he'd take me with fifteen short stories, particularly which genre they'd fall under. Only two or three qualify as science fiction; the others are slices of contemporary life. Like a visit to Loch Ness in Faber's adopted home of Scotland, I felt like a tourist waiting for something amazing to surface. Results like that were inconsistent, but the characters and scenery were memorable.-- \"Some Rain Must Fall.\" Frances Strathairn is no normal substitute teacher. The circumstances which brought her to Rotherey Elementary School and the Primary 6 classroom of her predecessor Mrs. Macshane slowly reveal themselves to the reader through the essays she's instructed her pupils to write on the subject of \"About Me, My School and My Teacher.\" Meanwhile, Frances considers whether her relationship with her partner Nick needs crisis management. This story hit me in the gut and sent me tumbling down a small flight of stairs. Faber's focus is so unique and compelling for a story approaching the subject matter that it does. ***** (5 stars).-- \"Fish.\" Janet and her daughter Kif Kif exist in a world where our sea creatures now swim through the air instead of the ocean. I wouldn't be surprised if Faber wrote this while serving a jury duty summons while someone sitting next to him watched a Studio Ghibli movie on their iPad. ** (2 stars).-- \"In Case of Vertigo.\" Sister Jennifer holds vigil on a deserted cliff, eating and sleeping in her car near a spot that apparently draw jumpers she is ready to save at a moment's notice. Quick little story with odd formatting choices that never made its character come alive. ** (2 stars).--\"Toy Story.\" God lives in an abandoned universe where to keep himself busy, he picks through the trash. One of his finds is a perfect blue planet he takes home and begins to conjure thoughts about. I liked the imagination and abbreviated whimsy of this, but didn't care much for it. ** (2 stars).-- \"Miss Fatt and Miss Thinne.\" Miss Fatt is a voluptuous actress whose career is taking off and her comely roommate Miss Thinne is a community nurse. The pair get along so well they're practically a single organism. What would happen if one day Miss Fatt couldn't stop eating and Miss Thinne couldn't eat? This story is not nearly as obnoxious as it sounds. I kept reading to find out what would become of Miss Fatt and Miss Thinne, intrigued by what might happen to someone who decided to eat constantly or not eat at all. But so far, four of five stories have not measured up to the quality control I expect from Faber. *** (3 stars).-- \"Half a Million Pounds and a Miracle.\" Robbie is a young stone mason contracted to help restore St. Hilda's, a Catholic church that has laid in ruin for over a century near Invergordon. After the Virgin Mary falls off her pedestal and smashes, Robbie searches for creative and budgetary solutions for repairing the statue to something close to its former glory. He shares his ideas with a young supermarket clerk named Catriona he meets at a disco and she expresses interest in visiting his work site. I love reading stories about people at work and Faber does a marvelous job integrating construction and Scottish culture into a story. **** (4 stars).-- \"The Red Cement Truck.\" A woman who has just been shot and likely killed in her home by a surprised burglar travels outside her body while her bumbling killer finishes ransacking her home and releases his bowels in her bathroom. Meanwhile, a vehicle pulls to the curb.The curtains of the living room, which had preserved the privacy, the intimacy, of her encounter with the man who suffering upstairs, rolled aside at a gesture of her hands, flooding her living room with light. It was eleven o'clock in the morning, and the world out there was brilliant with sunshine after a rainy start earlier on. The vehicle which had parked in front of her house, little more than arm's length from her window, was a cement truck so massive that only a section of it could be viewed, as if it were an absurdly enlarged detail from a painting, or a huge close-up filling a cinema screen. The enormous metal barrel was painted deep red, textured by corrosion, aged and weirdly organic. It revolved slowly, glistening with raindrops.It was easily the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.Haunting. Like the other two high quality stories so far, this one belongs to the spectral world of the author's science fiction/horror novel Under the Skin. It reminds me of what makes Faber such a unique writer: X-ray vision and bending genres like Superman bends steel. **** (4 stars).-- \"Somewhere Warm and Comfortable.\" Scott is a thirteen-year-old boy whose priorities are candy, Lego and stealing porn magazines. His sister Christine has been slipping him money their mother has earmarked for the movies or the zoo, buying his silence while Christine secretly visits her boyfriend. Scott wanders the shops getting into boy trouble. Plans change one afternoon when Christine asks her brother to accompany her to a clinic and later, find somewhere she can lay down and rest. Scott chooses an art gallery. Like \"Some Rain Must Fall,\" I appreciated Faber's unique focus on a cultural issue of our day, even if I didn't much like the characters at all. **** (4 stars).-- \"Nina's Hand.\" What if the right hand of a young woman working in a gherkin factory could develop its own consciousness? Faber imagines it for you. Beguiling and more than a bit spooky. In the late '70s, Sesame Street had a segment on the hand which I remember being a model's hand crawling against a black backdrop. This sent me running out of the living room in terror each time I saw it. **** (4 stars).-- \"The Crust of Hell.\" Ivan and Ivanka Silbermacher and their teenager Lydia move from Seattle to an army base in the impoverished nation of Bharatan in the Sahara Desert for several weeks. Ivan has been contracted to solve the country's famine problems and believes he is close to figuring out how to make it rain. Ivanka, his Hungarian wife of twenty-three years, wants to support her husband but begins to have her doubts about his decision-making. Lydia is a Goth who sets out to collect experiences she can use as coolness currency back home. Stunning setting, good character work, but the story didn't punch me in the gut. *** (3 stars).-- \"The Gossip Cell.\" Ed Jerome is an entrepreneur whose relationship with inventor Willie Spink has led to some amazing innovations--like the Sperome Eczema Vaccine--and riches, but none like Willie's latest brainstorm, a \"gossip cell\" that can talk to other cells and keep a beverage hot for indefinite periods of time. This piece reads like the rough draft of something Faber wrote in the taxi on the way to jury duty; sloppy, missing a piece, confusing. ** (2 stars).-- \"Accountability.\" Margo is a thirteen year old girl living on a failed farm in rural Australia. Her life is engaged in caring for her infirm grandmother and subverting Frank, her caregiver who reveals he is not actually Margo's biological father. Unable to leave her grandmother for more than two hours or attend school, Margo's education is regimented to a set of How and Why Wonder Books which Frank presents her each year. When Margo appears in a family way, she writes NASA for help. Faber's whimsy really fails him here. I found this story not only depressing, but boring. ** (2 stars).-- \"Pidgin American.\" Katarzyna (Kasia) is a Polish teenager living in London, where she works as a server at her uncle's restaurant and drifts through the nightlife. She is aware that the world is not what has been promoted on television and has been buying T-shirts in the U.K. with less an eye of going into business in Poland and more survival on her own terms. I really liked this character's voice and Faber's focus on the days and nights of a young immigrant, even if nothing really memorable happens in the story. **** (4 stars).-- \"The Tunnel of Love.\" Unemployed advertising executive in Melbourne takes a job as a spruiker at the Tunnel of Love, an adult bookstore and peep show. He gets to know his co-workers and gradually falls in love with Karen, the caustic manager of the bookstore whose labor of love are children's books. She helps the narrator hone his sales pitch on the sidewalk and seems appreciative of his company, but rejects his attempts at phone conversation outside of work. There's more humor in this story than any other in the book and with the focus on people at their jobs--with emphasis on a recession--I enjoyed it immensely. ***** (5 stars).-- \"Sheep.\" Five contemporary young artists in North America receive invitations to address a conference hosted by the Alternative Centre of the World in Scotland. However, the invitation turns out to be a prank by an anonymous trickster offended by the aesthetic of each artist. The three men and two women are left in a village five hours drive from Edinburgh with whatever cash they have on them. Not a bad story. I really enjoy Faber's Scotland-based tales the best. So much local character and atmosphere creeps into these stories which otherwise might not amount to much on the page. His critique of various modes of modern art is laser sharp. **** (4 stars)."}, {"userName": "Lynne King", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king", "userReview": "Miss Thinne heaved herself on the window-ledge like a nightmarish white praying mantis, and lowered her spindly legs carefully down into the dark and humid room. Her forklike feet dangled more than a metre from Miss Fatt\u2019s helplessly supine body.\nWhere to start with this sumptuous anthology of short stories? Coming across this author, whom I had never heard of before, was yet another serendipitous find in GR through reading friends\u2019 reviews. As soon as I saw the title I knew that this book was for me. I always read up on unknown authors before I begin one of their books so that I can get a feel of their psyche and whether or not I am going to like their writing. Well this Faber has certainly not failed me in that respect. I feel as if I\u2019m starting another love affair with an author as I did with John Williams and his four works last year. I found them all spellbinding and it is exactly the same with Faber. Some of the stories are satirical, others paranormal and others, well I can only describe them as utterly fascinating. I had great difficulty in fact putting this book down, kept on returning to various passages I found enlightening and thought about it when I went to bed, until I fell into the land of dreams and into the next morning when I was taking my breakfast. I kept on thinking how on earth does Faber\u2019s thought process work?Faber has the most extraordinarily vivid imagination. He creates stories that only exist in my phantasmagorical dreams and what is even better is that he keeps the momentum up to the end of each story. The descriptions of nature are spellbinding, with such clarity like paintings from the Old Masters. Whatever Faber writes, every single sentence and every single word is so visual to me. I want to be a spider and catch these in my web and never let them go. Where does my love of short stories come from? Well it has to be Guy de Maupassant. I read one of his collections and there was this remarkable story of a woman called \u201cBoule de Suif\u201d. I\u2019m not too sure what the French translation would be? Suet dumpling? Anyway I was entranced and that\u2019s for sure.Getting a feel about a book is of paramount importance for me but where to start with Faber\u2019s incredible book?Out of all the fifteen stories there is not one that I didn\u2019t like but if I describe every one I will go on for pages. So those that were wondrous for me were:FishThis story rather overwhelmed me. It involves the daily life of Janet and her daughter Kif. They have one problem \u2013 they are surrounded by fish of all sizes that actually float around and over them. I found it rather disconcerting. There\u2019s a rather dreadful situation involving the Church of Armageddon (which actually is rather apt!) when blue-black whales from low gray clouds suddenly appear and glide over Janet and Kif. After a lot of cruising around they go in the direction of the church and proceed to flatten it. It was an amazing description. Full marks to the author as it left me breathless!Miss Fatt and Miss ThinneMiss Thinne was not thin and she lived with Miss Fatt, who was not fat; they were fairly young ladies. The former worked as a nurse at the Community Health Centre where she \u201cEleanor\u201d was greatly liked and known \u201cas a marvel\u201d. Whereas the latter worked for a glamour agency (as she was rather busty she didn\u2019t get much fashion work) and was rather successful working on adverts. She had aspirations of being an actress. They were both very content with their lives but then one day strange things began to happen\u2026Faber is at his best when he describes this and the denouement is actually rather sad but superbly written.The Tunnel of LoveYes this is sexually graphic but actually rather sensuous. It is about a pornography bookstore with this title that has a cinema and lots of sexual objects and attractions. It is the story of Mike, an unemployed advertising executive who needs to work. He happens to be passing this shop one day and is looking at the spruiker. I had to look this up. Evidently it\u2019s \u201cAustralian slang spruik to give a speech, make a barker's spiel (of unknown origin).\u201dWell Mike is taken with Karen who works in the shop, sharing it with Darren. All said and done it is all brilliantly written and that\u2019s all I need to say.SheepThis story is extraordinary. Five weird artists from New York are invited to go to the Alternative Centre of the World in Scotland. Their airline tickets and all of their expenses are paid and when they arrive in the village of Inver, way north of Edinburgh, they find that they have been conned! The bus driver tosses out a package and abandons them. Each receives a letter and a book of \u201cThe Glory of the Highlands\" and a letter from an Art Lover who proceeds with a diatribe against each of them. Nevertheless sheep do indeed come into the equation and I chuckled to myself throughout the entire story.It was an absolutely wonderful experience for me reading this book and now I\u2019m going to explore Faber\u2019s other works. My\u2026 Did this make my day.As an afterthought, dreams and expectations are what makes up our life on this incredible planet of ours. Faber has managed to achieve this."}, {"userName": "Peter Boyle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903072-peter-boyle", "userReview": "Michel Faber is one of my very favourite writers. If you are ever unlucky enough to be trapped in a conversation about books with me, I will most certainly bring him up, and I apologise in advance for the excited gibberish and wild gesticulations that ensue.Some Rain Must Fall is his debut collection of stories and the signs are already present of a rare talent at work. There is a such a wide range of styles on show here that one can't fail to be impressed: some are surreal, some are satirical, others examine tragedy with tremendous grace and care. Faber is in possession of such a unique imagination and curiosity about the world, and what a pleasure it is to sample the fruits of his labour.I found something to love in each of the fifteen stories but there are a few that really stood out. Fish, a immeasurably strange and unsettling tale which features sea creatures swimming through the air of an unnamed city, haunted my dreams for many nights afterwards. Accountability is about a pregnant teenager in the Australian outback, who has a surefire plan for escaping the clutches of her abusive father. The ending of that one just broke me. And a story in which the protagonist is a woman's hand (yes, a hand), begins with a slightly comical tone but turns into something quite moving and beautiful:\n\"The air thinned, was less rich in sensation, and such sensations as passed through the hand now were soothingly familiar: the memory of breadcrumbs in the bed, the fine stubble on the jaw of a beautiful man in the morning, the brilliant floes of soapsuds in the bath, the discovery of damp viridescent moss in the world just outside the doorstep.\"\nI would recommend this wonderfully inventive and thought-provoking collection to anyone, especially those who have enjoyed Under the Skin or The Book of Strange New Things. Oh and a word about the gorgeous Canons Edition cover - it is one of the most stylish and eye-catching designs I have seen in quite some time and would brighten any bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "[A wealthy fan of more traditional art tricks five American artists to being abandoned in the Scottish highlands, \"the world of real Art, and the environment that inspires it\".

And all handled with equal skill and creativity. \u201cSheep\u201d is a hilarious T. C. Boyle-ish story about a prank played on five avant-garde artists. The title story is dark realism that uses snippets from student essays to reveal the trauma that is otherwise not revealed. I loved \u201cPidgin American,\u201d which is both a social commentary and a wonderful stew of meaning, and it has a great double-surprise ending. \u201cSomewhere Warm and Comfortable\u201d is another killer of a story that manages to make two stale themes\u2014coming-of-age and abortion\u2014fresh. It also has a beautiful device that creates tension in the first scene and is not released until the end, kind of like the gun on the mantle in a detective story. \u201cThe Red Cement Truck\u201d is Faber\u2019s ghost story. And then there\u2019s \u201cThe Tunnel of Love,\u201d a story about a laid-off advertising executive who takes a job in a sex shop, but that is really the last thing the story is about.

This explores a multitude of complex human relationships from obsession in spite of love to being there for someone in a way that you don't even understand.\tI appreciate certain tales with premises and concepts that soon become apparent though predicting the ending remains disappointing.
