It was an amazing and inspiring book. Of course it made me laugh and cry but I am always so impressed by people that have the courage and commitment to follow their dreams. The founders of Best Friends Sanctuary are incredible people - my hat goes off to anyone that is willing to work so hard to help those who cannot speak for themselves.After reading the book, I dreamt about visiting there and getting a chance to volunteer. I had a chance to do that when I was sent to a conference in Las Vegas in February. I was only there for 2 days but they were quite possibly the best two days of my life. Which is especially interesting when you consider I spent my vacation time walking dogs, picking up poop, etc! The compassion and generosity of the people working there is incredible. I cried when I left because I didn't want to go. I started planning my next trip right away and will soon be going back for a full week.If you love animals, this place is the Promised Land and you have to go. But read the book first so that you truly appreciate what they have managed to accomplish there."}, {"userName": "SouthWestZippy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39124031-southwestzippy", "userReview": "The book walks you through many of the startup heartaches, dealing with people who discard animals like trash when they no longer want or need them and money issues. If you can't handle animal abuse stories you might want to stay clear of this book, there is not many of them but enough to show you the need for such a place. Good book overall but does get into unnecessary details. The unnecessary details are in the friends' stories who started the Animal Sanctuary and dealing with people. I wanted more animal stories but again good book overall."}, {"userName": "Beverly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4428545-beverly", "userReview": "Best Friends: The True Story of the World's Most Beloved Animal Sanctuary by Samantha Glen describes how Best Friends Animal Sanctuary originated and expanded. The book commences in 1982 when a group of friends pooled their resources and decided to purchase 3,000 acres in Kanab, Utah in order to build the animal sanctuary of their dreams. They had already outgrown the ranch they had purchased four years earlier in Prescott, AZ. The author chronicles the first fifteen years of Best Friends and covers all its trials, tribulations, and victories. The author introduces us to the friends who made their dream a reality and to the animals who were the reason for the sanctuary's creation. The book is full of heartwarming stories. My favorite story from the book is about two brothers, Tommy and Tyson. These two cats were living on the mean streets of Los Angeles and always walked with their tales entwined. The wonderful woman who fed them noticed that they were in danger as they slowly crossed a busy street. She finally realized why they walked side by side entwining their tails. Tommy was blind and Tyson was guiding him. She knew that they could not survive long on the streets and called Best Friends. The sanctuary did not hesitate, and Tommy and Tyson are now living the good life at the WildCats Village where there is no need to walk with their tails intertwined. The purpose of the founders of Best Friends was to create a sanctuary where all animals, including the unadoptable and those with special needs, could live their natural lives being cared for and loved. The intent of this book is to tell their story and to inform its readers of ways to make a difference in the lives of animals everywhere. The book not only includes ways to get involved with Best Friends but also ways to help in your own community. The Best Friends web site is a wealth of information on how to get involved locally and nationally. Best Friends is a must read for those who love animals. Some may put off reading it because of preconceived notions that it is filled with stories of animal abuse and neglect. There are a few stories of animal abuse, but the animals end up at Best Friends to live out their days in peace. The tone of the book is very optimistic.  My favorite quote is from this book, \"There is no better application of the Golden Rule than to help a homeless pet. In doing this, you are giving the gift of life itself. And since there is no greater gift, there can be no greater reward\" (281). This is certainly true. I currently have four cats, whom I rescued from shelters, and the joy they bring me is indescribable."}, {"userName": "Drew Danko", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3203274-drew-danko", "userReview": "This is one of the best \"feel good\" books I've ever read. If you ever doubted the power of having a vision, or of having a diverse group, or of having commitment to a goal, or having shared values then you will want to read this book because that is how they created one of the world's best animal sanctuaries.Can you imagine taking in all kinds of critters in all stages of health and functionality, hundreds of them, with very scarce resources to support your efforts. That is exactly what this small band of animal lovers did over many years. But thanks to their persistence their efforts were recognized by others leading to funding and volunteers sufficient to enable their long term success. But although the problem of killing or abandoning unwanted pets is diminishing, there is still no end in sight of animals needing their lifelong protection.So read this book, but be prepared for some tears when you learn about the condition of some of the animals they found. But because we are talking about BEST FRIENDS, these sad tears will turn to ones of happiness.There have been many great accomplisments in our country; this is one of them."}, {"userName": "NebraskaIcebergs", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2376750-nebraskaicebergs", "userReview": "Of the five books that I read about rescues (of which sanctuaries are a part), Best Friends: The True Story of the World\u2019s Most Beloved Sanctuary by Samantha Glen is my favorite, because of how exhaustive it is. Glen takes readers all the way to the 1980s to before Best Friends Animal Society existed, to when a handful of friends were rescuing animals the way many of us do by taking them home. Thankfully for animal welfare, when these friends dreamed, they liked to dream big. And I mean BIG. In 1982, Francis Battista made a call to his friends telling them that he had found an oasis in the desert that would be perfect for an animal sanctuary. And from then to today, it was five steps forward and at times ten steps back. The group faced opposition from residents, bankruptcy, and the death of their first veterinarian. At a pivotal moment, they also had to decide whether to stay small or to reach out to animal welfare groups across the country. Doing so was far from easy, because many volunteers were introverted animal lovers who valued their solitude, but found themselves having to embrace the commercial aspects of being a business. They didn\u2019t always embrace the changes with grace, but they always managed to find a way to put first the needs of the sanctuary and the animals within it. Best Friends is an inspiring tale of passion put into action!"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/976147-jessica", "userReview": "I learned about Best Friends sometime around 2005, I think. I fell in love with their mission and visited Kanab in 2007. My mom joined me on the trip as I think she feared I'd follow through on my threat to quit my job and move to the middle of nowhere and take care of dogs. The sanctuary was amazing. I just wish I had thought to do some volunteer work while there. Over the years I have donated to them when I could.Last year I was digging through a bin of books at my job's sample sale. Every book with a dog on the cover went in my bag. I didn't even read the title, much less the description. When I got home and looked at my finds, I was excited to see that I one of the books I picked up was about Best Friends. I tend to procrastinate reading non-fiction (for fear that it will be dull), which is why I just got around to reading it.This was a phenomenal read! For starters, it's a non-fiction book that reads like a fiction book. Secondly, it is just absolutely amazing to picture the humble beginnings of an organization that is well known among animal lovers and that was instrumental in rescuing a number of the Michael Vick dogs a few years ago. I loved how the stories of the animals helped to tell the story of the sanctuary, bringing the factual account of the organization's history to life and painting a clear picture of the love and passion the founders have for animals.My only criticism is that the book stopped nearly 15 years ago. Despite being a supporter for the last 10 or so years (has it really been that long?), this book brings a completely different perspective to the group's evolution.Thank you Best Friends for all that you do and all that you have done."}, {"userName": "Randi Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5580150-randi-robinson", "userReview": "This book should be required reading for anyone interested in saving animals. It tells the story of a group of friends with a cause and the wonderful amazing result of their determination. I read this book because I had to read a nonfiction book for a summer reading club and I like dogs. I have since volunteered at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary 3 times and will continue to go back as long as my old bones will let me.Indeed I would like to retire to Kanab, Utah and spend the rest of my days volunteering at Best Friends. It is the happiest most beautiful wonderful place on earth!! To read how it came to be and then to see the result is truly awe-inspiring. From a group of determined friends came a world wide movement with a dream of no more homeless pets. Best Friends has outreach programs all over the country and is involved in animal rescues in natural disasters and in man-made disasters such as puppy mills and dog fighting.I cannot stop telling people about Best Friends but I can never have enough words to describe the wonder of this Sanctuary.

Best Friends seems like an incredible place and I am in total admiration of the people who were so selfless and generous in the time it took to get the sanctuary up and running. It's wonderful that animals who would not be given a chance in many places have this wonderful place to call home. I normally wouldn't say that a shelter is the kind of place that an animal should spend all his or her days, but based on what I see on social media, Best Friends seems to have no short supply of visitors and volunteers who are able to give the time needed and deserved to each animal there. I do wish that the book had provided more information on how Best Friends plans to achieve their goal of no more homeless pets rather than just telling the story of how the sanctuary began. I'm interested to hear more about their strategies and steps to reach their end goals and this was not included in the book at all."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8717740-ron", "userReview": "Take a look...

The tenor of the book is optimistic and filled with the can-do attitude of its founders, and I was pleasantly surprised that the heartbreaking animal stories did not digress into a militant, PETA-like attitude.  Additionally, I find it admirable that the fulfillment of the founders' vision was the result of their personal generosity of time, money, and love; they were not afraid of hard work, pinching pennies, and creative thinking to accomplish their goal. Because of this old-school attitude, combined with helping animals, I find myself drawn to the sanctuary and could easily envision a working vacation at Best Friends. Lastly, a word about the excellent writing by Samantha Glen. Rarely have I read a book so engaging and well written! I would add extra stars if possible.

This is their (sort of) story.Best Friends: The True Story of the World's Most Beloved Animal Sanctuary could have been a far more interesting read with a bit of author disengagement from the title subject; as such, it reads like a better-written, lengthier version of the free paperbacks charities occasionally send out with donation mailings. The beginnings of Best Friends is glossed-over and not given much mention; this is because the beginning of this pet welfare group is well, kind of  unpleasant. However, groups that have done bad things are not incapable of also doing great good, and reading the stories contained in this volume will have you convinced that many, many individual animals\u2019 lives took a vastly better turn thanks to Best Friends. Animal lovers will no doubt recognize the great personality, humor, strength, and tragedy of pets\u2019 experiences in the many stories contained here. It should be noted that this book was published before the Michael Vick case and before the battle-scarred fighting dog, rather than the blind kitten or the geriatric Benji mutt, became the face of Best Friends. Some are convincingly arguing that this group has once again been  blown off course,  leading to some behaviors that can be considered  inexcusable.

It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, and it tells a beautiful story, of how a group of friends built one of the world's most unique and compassionate animal sanctuaries.During the 1960's, this group came together, from all faiths and walks of life. These friendships endured and deepened, bonded by optimism, love for animals, and a shared vision of a safe haven where all creatures would be welcomed and loved, in spite of illness, disability, or general lack of \"pet\" appeal. During the 1980's, the dream became a reality, and with much warmth and sincerity, this book chronicles the struggles and triumphs of such an endeavor, as well as spotlighting the people and animals that make Best Friends Sanctuary a beacon of hope and inspiration for all who love animals. It's well worth noting that since Best friends came to be in 1984, the number of euthanized animals has dropped from 17 million annually to 5 million.

Financial problems were touched on but not dwelt on. It reminds me, in some ways, of Mountains Beyond Mountains, the bio of Paul Farmer. In that book's preface, I believe, the author says he admires Farmer which sort of sets up the idea that the biography is not completely impartial. In Best Friends, one gets the sense that the author is a great admirer of the sanctuary. Which is not to say that the book is not truthful, just slanted. To me this presents the question of, is this a good book? Yes and no, I suppose. I enjoyed reading it and couldn't wait to learn about another critter they rescued. But as a story of the sanctuary's founding and its growth, well, not so good, I suppose. How did they do it? More details on that part of the story. Maybe.

I had heard some of the stories of the animals themselves - a fellow dog-walker at our local Humane Society shared two little books put out by Best Friends - one was about Dogtown and the other was about the cats - so I was familiar with Ginger & the sheriff & Victor the dogfather & Tomato & Benton & Sinjin.
