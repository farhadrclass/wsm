Knowing how her late husband felt about his childhood and parents, Deidre keeps resisting. Franklin hires a new lawyer and recruits him to get close to her. As Jason gets close to the widow, he does not see a bad mother or wife, but a woman he could fall for. When Deidre's son, Kevin is found at the bottom of the stairs and his babysitter murdered, Deidre has a new threat in her life. I have wanted to try a Marta Perry novel for awhile now. She is know for her Amish fiction, and was happy to see this romantic suspense on NetGalley. This is the first book in a trilogy set in a small town called Echo Falls. One of my favourite suspense series, Kate Burkholder by Linda Castillo is also set among the Amish. Castillo's series is gritty and very informative about the Amish culture. In this book, the romance and suspense is very mild. It is more a cozy mystery with a side of romance. There is a bit of Amish culture, but it is just background thing rather than a character like in Castillo's books. While the mystery is not that tight, as the identity does not really seem hidden, I did enjoy the small-town and hope that the second book will get a bit better."}, {"userName": "Maureen Timerman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3840941-maureen-timerman", "userReview": "Why would someone want to kill her best friend, this is what Deidre has to find out, when her son is injured, and we don\u2019t know who would want to hurt them.From the beginning to the end we are waiting to see who is the murderer, and again who is breaking into the house, and making attempts on their lives.We are in Amish Pennsylvania and although Deidre isn\u2019t Amish lots of her relatives are, and I loved how Kevin, her 5-year-old son, and his cousin Ben, who doesn\u2019t yet speak English, converse and play together.We follow along in this nail-biting story but are able to enjoy the picturesque scenery around us; I could almost feel the mist from the falls. While the place is beautiful, there also seems to be danger lurking, but why.When we find out the details, they are so very heart breaking, but I never saw all of it coming. A real page turner of a story, and can\u2019t wait for the next book in this series.I received this book through Net Galley and the Publisher Harlequin, and was not required to give a positive review."}, {"userName": "Kathy Martin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3122948-kathy-martin", "userReview": "Jason Glassman has taken a job as an attorney in Echo Falls after he was betrayed by his fiance and almost disbarred because of what she did. When his new boss - Judge Morris - asks him to get close to his daughter-in-law and try to find out if she is a fit mother to his grandson, Jason agrees. But getting to know Deidre Morris shows him a woman far different than the picture the judge painted of her.At their first encounter, he sees her home and they discover the body of her friend who was babysitting for five-year-old Kevin who has also been badly injured. Kevin doesn't remember anything about what happened. His last memory is of earlier that day. But someone is afraid that Kevin will remember. Deidre wants to know what happened to her friend Dixie and she wants her small son to be safe. Jason spends time with Deidre and Kevin during this difficult time and begins to care for her. He becomes more and more convinced that the judge's suspicions are baseless.Meanwhile the judge is keeping the pressure on Deidre to move Kevin and her to his cold, formal home. Deidre is reluctant because she knows what pressure he put on his son and doesn't want to subject her son to it. But the judge is a powerful man in the small town and it is hard for Deidre to go against him.I enjoyed the setting of this story and the strong relationships. Deidre has a good support system among her Amish cousins. I also liked the way the relationship between Jason and Deidre grew slowly. This was a very nice romantic suspense story."}, {"userName": "Susan F", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/983488-susan-f", "userReview": "I really enjoy Marta Perry's books and this is another excellent read. I think it's a great start to her new series. The story starts right off with suspense and tension involving the main characters. Marta touches on the Amish which she is well known for by having the main character be the daughter of a former Amish man so her cousins surround her. readers who aren't into the Amish stories will be comfortable with this as the story is much more contemporary with some 'real world' challenges and heartache. It's a good mystery, a clean read and realistic storyline. Thanks to the publisher and NetGalley for my copy. I really want to read the rest of the series."}, {"userName": "Books and Spoons", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23424877-books-and-spoons", "userReview": "A vastly entertaining romance novel that has the perfect name since throughout the story there is the echo of danger that you can sense and the lurking threat that can give you chills. I really enjoyed the Amish neighbors, their customs, they culture, their language or should I say a way to speak with that tinted dutch accent (or at least I read in my mind every dialog with them with that accent!). There was a peaceful and harmonious co-existence with the English and the Amis that spoke to my heart. For some reason, I found it a beautiful way to live. All the characters were drawn with an intense and sharp pen. They were charming and engaging, each of them demanding attention when present in the scene. Deidre Morris was a delightful heroine. No matter what the rumors are, she is a kind-hearted, capable, gracious woman, a great mother, and a good friend. She is one of those characters that you immediately click with, and find the common ground, could even be friends with in real life. Jase Glassman had grown up in a rough environment and had recently experienced the ultimate betrayal of a loved one. His life is in shambles as he moves to the small town, trying to find his footing again. He is thankful for the chance to still be a lawyer when his new employer asks him an odd favor. I liked Jase. He didn't deserve the devastation he was delivered to. He had a good heart, he is kind to strangers and small children, he has good and simple morals and values, only if he could be honest about his intentions. I liked how the plot was built, how the romance advanced. It was a slow road to the first kiss, not to mention to any declaration of feelings. The whole romance is clean and sweet with no more than kissing between the hero and heroine. The novel had a focus on the life and living around the town, with the constant small attacks towards Deidre and Jase, and the odd things happening around them. I liked how Deidre's son and Jase were building a relationship as well, and the team the three formed as the story moved on. Echo of Danger is a mix of tender romance, small town living, and a murder investigation, with constant malice towards the characters that brings tension and strain to the tale and draws the main characters even closer together. A great summer read!~ Four Spoons"}, {"userName": "Brooklynsmom55", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18139097-brooklynsmom55", "userReview": "Loved the book.

While the main characters are not Amish, some of the secondary ones are, and the quiet county seat of Echo Falls is stunned to discover crimes and sinister events. At heart the tale is one of manipulating, controlling relationships. A young widow finds her father-in-law trying to take over her life and more importantly her young son's life. From the start, when the senior man demands to sell her house and have her move in to his rambling home, we know this is wrong. Yet it would also be wrong to stop a grandparent from seeing a child. She defers a decision. Then a lawyer is assigned to - quietly - shadow the lady and try to prove her an unfit mother. Maybe some readers will be able to see their own relationships in a new light. While there is action, this isn't a thriller. I especially enjoyed the scenes set in rugged countryside. The romance that develops is suitable for older teens or adults. I read an ARC from Net Galley. This is an unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Deana Dick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6244880-deana-dick", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the book. Deidre and her son are trying to pick up the pieces after her husband dies. I loved how the author portrayed her as a strong woman who doesn\u2019t roll over when a crisis hits. Her fierce protection of her son is extremely well written. What happens when your father-in-law is a very powerful judge? Deidre finds that her father-in-law is very controlling. He wants to have his grandson live under his roof and will do anything to have that happen. I did like Jase but sometimes he irritated me. Is he there to help Deidre or secretly gathering information for the judge. It won\u2019t me easy to fight such a powerful person but Deidre hopes Jase will prove to be someone she can count on. When an accident involving Deidre\u2019s son puts his life in danger, she must find out who is trying to harm him. I loved the Amish references in the book and how Deidre still held her upbringing as an important part of her. The book is packed with intrigue and danger that leads to a exciting ending. Who can Deidre trust? Find out in this action packed book that delivers a high intensity thriller ."}, {"userName": "Donna Repsher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7713587-donna-repsher", "userReview": "Let me start by stating that I'm a huge fan of Marta Perry's Amish series, and when I saw that she was writing a new non-Amish series, was eager to read the first novel in the series, but while it was well-written, I wasn't head-over heels for it, and could only give it 3.5 stars.The plot is pretty simple and straightforward, Deidre Morris was widowed one year ago. She's still not over her late husband, Frank, and is now caring for her 5-year-old son, Kevin, alone. Her late husband was a lawyer who worked for his father, Judge Franklin Morris, a tough, rigid and controlling man, and now that his son is gone, he's been trying to get Deirdre and her son to move from her family home to his mansion on a hill, where he lives with his alcoholic wife, Sylvia, and where her late husband was poorly raised, never able to meet his own father's expectations. Deirdre has refused, but that doesn't stop the judge from trying to manipulate matters. The judge's latest attempt is his hiring of Jason, an attorney, to replace his late son at his law firm. There's one caveat to Jason's hiring, the judge expects him to find enough dirt on Deirdre to ensure that he'd win a custody fight for his grandson.One evening, while Deirdre was attending a meeting, she comes home to find her friend and babysitter, Dixie, dead in her living room, and Kevin unconscious on the stairs. Kevin is comatose, and when he eventually wakes, has no memory of the events leading to Dixie's death, and the search for her killer and threats to Deirdre's life form the background of this novel. Since this novel was listed on Netgalley as romantic suspense, I expected much more romance than murder mystery, and more possible suspects than were given by Ms. Perry. As whodunits go, the murderer was obvious from the get-go, as for suspense it was mild at best considering the rather small cast of possible suspects, and, as a romance, there wasn't much of that either. What I liked best about the novel, oddly enough, was Deirdre's next-door neighbor and close friend, Judith, an Amish woman who is Deirdre's internet business partner, and mother to Kevin's friend Benjamin. While I cannot fault Ms. Perry's writing skills--she has them in spades, this novel just didn't measure up to her previous, excellent and suspenseful Amish mysteries, either in plot, character development or suspense. I sincerely hope to see more of the aforementioned in the next novel in this series.I read and reviewed an advance reader copy of this novel and received no compensation for doing so. The opinions expressed are my own."}, {"userName": "Leslie M.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35473206-leslie-m", "userReview": "I reviewed this for RT Bookreviews Magazine: https://www.rtbookreviews.com/book-re... If you are looking for a book with more mystery than romance, this is one to consider. While the suspense angle is interesting overall, it is a bit slow to build, and there is some predictability. The characters are well-developed and likable.Widow Deidre Morris is trying to get on with her life and do the best for her son Kevin after the loss of her husband. Her father-in-law, Judge Franklin Morris, never felt she was good enough for his son, and Franklin does not believe she should be the one raising Kevin. Franklin hires attorney Jase Glassman to befriend Deidre and gather evidence to help him prove his case. However, plans change a bit when a murder rocks the small community. It seems likely that Kevin saw something, but he refuses to talk about it. Jase is determined to keep Deidre and Kevin safe. Will Franklin be able to prove his case, or will Deidre find help and support from an unlikely source?
