This book touched my heart, made me laugh so many times, made me mad and made me cry. There are a lot of books I would never have read if it wasn't for my Goodreads friends, but the two most memorable and that have made it to my favorites list are: The Conte Of Monte Cristo and Lonesome Dove I loved so many characters in this book and I feel like I have been on that journey with them. I kept wishing they would have stayed in Texas or at least stopped in Nebraska after so much they went through. And my emotions are still raw as I cry. Because people die and when you love characters you don't want that but that is life for real, life in books and life in movies and tv. I will write a more detailed review after I have had some time away from what I just read. I'm going to have to watch some shows, read more books and come back to talk about these people I grew to love. To be continued. . . Mel \u2764\ufe0fLike I have said, this book really got to me. I fell in love with so many of the characters. I loved Augustus and he made me laugh through this whole book. I have to say he was my favorite character. I loved Call too but Gus was the one. I loved Deets and he also has a special place in my heart. I loved how he was with them for 30 something years. He was a great man and a great tracker. Roscoe is another character who cracked me up. He was so innocent and funny. I loved the relationship between him and the little girl, Janey. I didn't really care for Jake at all. If they never listened to him none of the bad things would have happened. I felt bad for him for a minute when he ended up with the Suggs boys and what happened to him in that situation. I felt bad for Lorena and all that happened to her. I loved the relationship between her and Gus. I loved Newt (who could not love Newt). I really wish he could have gotten better closure at the end of the book. I loved Pea Eye, the Irishmen, the pigs, the horses, Bolivar, Po, Clara, July, Joe, Wilbarger and I'm sure I have left some out. I just know that if you have been putting off reading this book, don't, go ahead and get to it. I think 9 times out of 10, you won't regret it!

When I was thirty pages into it and complaining to him about being unable to handle any more discussion about horses and beans, he made me a bet: If I got to page 101 (out of 900, mind you) and I still didn't enjoy it, he'd take me out to dinner at any restaurant I wanted in New York City. If at page 101 I had warmed up to it, I had to finish. I don't think I made it past the 60th page before I knew I had \"lost\" the bet.The characters in this story are more real than in any other book I've read. I came to absolutely love characters I was so thoroughly annoyed with earlier in the book. I feel that the depth of the characters allowed me to do something I can rarely do with the real people I encounter on a daily basis in my life -- to truly know each and every one of them so fully and so deeply so as to be able to wholly sympathize with them and genuinely understand the motivations behind their actions, no matter how much I might disapprove.I was so engrossed in this book that I had no problem regularly making a fool of myself in public places - on the subway, in coffee shops - gasping, weeping, and shouting \"Nuh-uh!\"My only criticism of the book is the way in which it plays into classic Western stereotypes, particularly its portrayal of nearly every Native American character as a brutal savage. Except for one character's brief mention of \"well, they didn't invite us on this land,\" the issues surrounding white settlers effectively stealing the land of another people is not addressed. It's something to try to constantly keep in mind for sure, but not something to keep you from reading this fantastic book."}, {"userName": "Brina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina", "userReview": "Larry McMurtry is considered one of America's master story tellers. His novels include Terms of Endearment and The Last Picture Show, as well as the screenplay to Brokeback Mountain, which later became award winning films. A revered author in Texas, he was invited by former First Lady Laura Bush to be a special guest speaker at the first annual Texas Book Festival. It seems fitting that I began his definitive work, Pulitzer winning Lonesome Dove, on his birthday, June 3. A story of Texas Rangers and winning the western frontier, which later encouraged McMurtry to create a tetralogy, Lonesome Dove is considered the foremost work of American western fiction. Augustus \"Gus\" McCrae and Woodrow F. Call ride as Texas Rangers for nearly thirty years, keeping the new state safe from Indians, Mexicans, and ruffians following the completion of the Civil War. By the time of the volume's opening, however, Mexicans decided to stay on their side of the Rio Grande and most Indians had cleared out of south Texas, leaving the area to law abiding citizens. Even though the two never tired completely of rangering, they founded the Hat Creek Outfit, a stables outside of Lonesome Dove, a settlement close to the Mexican border. It is here that McCrae and Call got their team of Rangers back together for one final adventure before they ride off into the sunset. Creating a large cast of characters and multiple storylines that eventually meet up, McMurtry creates a western novel that is more than the story of cowboys and Indians. Former ranger Jake Spoon, a good guy turned outlaw, convinced Call to move thousands of cattle and start the first ranch north of the Milk River in Montana. At the time unexplored territory, Call is up for the challenge and assembles a team of cowboys to make the journey north. The group, full of colorful personalities, got more than they bargained for on the trip. Most thought it was to be a journey, get paid, and then return home to Lonesome Dove. They did not sign up for river crossings, sandstorms, and skirmishes with Indians and grizzly bears. Yet, Call desires to conquer virgin territory and make a name for himself as one of the pioneers of the Montana land grab. McCrae signs up for the journey as a last hurrah with his lifelong friend. Yet even he gets more than he asked for on the trip. A carefree persona happy to sit back with a glass of whiskey and a deck of cards, McCrae would rather be outside a saloon in Lonesome Dove than on a two thousand mile journey north. Yet, the thought of seeing the love of his life Clara Allen at the midway point of the trek, spurs McCrae to join up. Along the way, he saves a whore named Lorena from a vile Indian named Blue Duck and becomes her guardian, only to find himself when he meets with Clara once and for all. This story line tugged on my emotions the most as McMurtry weaves multiple characters' stories together to form a nexus at Clara's ranch. It is here that both the cowboys and their loves must make key decisions that are vital to the duration of the novel. McMurtry makes Lonesome Dove more than just a story of cowboys by informing his readers of key events that have taken place to change the course of the American west. He touches on the plight of the Indians who in the 1870s are still fighting off the cavalry and cowboys for control of the great land grab. The army, settlers, and Indians all think that the land belongs to them, setting the stage for epic battle scenes, none as brutal as those involving Blue Duck. He also has the cowboys in their dialogue describe how if they are not careful all of the buffalo will be gone soon, so the men enjoy watching and running with the great creatures while they are still able. McMurtry also touches on the place of women in society as he describes in detail the characters of Lorena, Clara, and a wandering soul named Elmira. All three are limited in choices between marriage and whoring, and in the end Clara desires a brighter future for both Lorena and her two daughters.While I enjoyed the multiple story lines, the place of women, the character studies, and history, the journey from Texas to Montana is what kept me reading this volume. At 750 pages in length, the novel is fast reading as I desired to see the resolution of this complex story that McMurtry has created. Now that I have completed and left behind Lonesome Dove, I am ready to return again as the writing was captivating and held my attention throughout. As I attempt to read through the Pulitzers, I view Lonesome Dove as one of the best. I hope to return to the tetralogy at some point, but I would like to savor this 5 star read for awhile first."}, {"userName": "Bill  Kerwin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83582-bill-kerwin", "userReview": "The account of a cattle drive from Texas to Montana. This is a very long novel which is nevertheless always compelling. It contains memorable characters whose adventures are narrated in a deceptively straightforward style.What impresses me most about this book is that the fates of the characters are neither cornily predictable nor deliberately surprising. The book's great length allows life to happen to them as it happens to all of us.

In fact, put a gun to my head and tell me chose just one, and it\u2019d be better than even money that Lonesome Dove would be what I\u2019d name. It has the bonus of not only being an incredible book but also having an excellent companion piece in the television mini-series based on it that is one of the great all-time fusions of print and film. I can\u2019t read this without hearing the voices of Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Anjelica Huston, Chris Cooper, Danny Glover, Diane Lane and all the rest in my head.* So every couple of years, I do a rereading of the book and then I break out the DVD of the miniseries and I immerse myself in the perfection that is this story. * I didn\u2019t know this until I was looking up some stuff on the net for this review, but Lonesome Dove was virtually snubbed at the Emmy Awards. War & Remembrance beat it out for best mini-series. It only managed to take best director and a few other technical prizes. Worse yet, none of the actors nominated won. It\u2019s a good thing I never got into any bar wagers about this, or I would have bet my house that Robert Duvall won best actor for a mini-series , and when I lost that, I would have bet my car that it had to be Tommy Lee Jones. Nope. Anjelica Huston and Diane Lane and Danny Glover all lost, too. Hey, Emmy voters of 1990! WTF??Why do I say the story is perfect? Start with the characters. Augustus McRae and Woodrow Call are two retired Texas Rangers who run a rinky-dink cattle company in a speck of a town called Lonesome Dove on the Texas/Mexico border. Gus and Call couldn\u2019t be more unlikely friends. Call is a dour workaholic who has spent his life trying to be the perfect leader of men while Gus is a good-natured and lazy soul who likes to drink whiskey, play cards and spend time with Lonesome Dove\u2019s beautiful but distant whore, Lorena Wood. Gus also delights in giving Call grief about young Newt, a boy they took in after the death of his mother. Newt\u2019s mom was a whore that Call had visited regularly for a short time, and he may be the boy\u2019s father but refuses to acknowledge it.Their dull routine is broken when their old friend and fellow ex-Ranger Jake Spoon shows up. Jake, who is another candidate to be Newt's dad, is looking for a hiding place after accidentally shooting a man in Arkansas, and he fears that the sheriff, July Johnson, will be after him. Jake\u2019s idle remark about having been to Montana and that it\u2019s a cattleman\u2019s paradise for the first men to risk the hostile Indians starts a fever in Call. He wants to be the first to drive a herd to the Montana territory and start a ranch there.Call soon has started hiring men and stealing Mexican cattle for the drive. Gus says that Call is going to get them all killed just to have another adventure in a wild frontier, but he goes along to see his old sweetheart Clara who is living in Nebraska. Jake has taken up with Lorena and decides to travel along with the herd, much to Gus\u2019s amusement and Call\u2019s aggravation. The large cast of characters carry their hopes, fears and limitations with them out onto the vast plains of the American Midwest, and the drive turns out to be dangerous in ways they couldn\u2019t even imagine.This book has everything that anyone could want in a story. It\u2019s epic in scale, but relatable through it\u2019s shifting point of view through a variety of vivid characters. There\u2019s intense western action and heart breaking love stories. It\u2019s incredibly profound and amazingly simple. It\u2019s hilarious at times but could reduce the toughest man in the world to tears at some points. And all of this is set during those last moments when America was still half-wild and anyone with the gumption to do so could throw together a herd of cattle and go out into the wilderness to make history or lose their scalp."}, {"userName": "Arah-Lynda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859453-arah-lynda", "userReview": "Hands Down my Favourite Book in 2014First of all the physical; the book I see looking up at me from my coffee table. It looks worn, well thumbed, well read, pages and cover alike, beginning to curl up, and soiled by use. Well that and all the casual (I take books with me) acquaintances, to the one, they all had to pick it up, look it over. It may look well rode, but it still feels soft, warm and pliant in my hand. The stars twinkle up at me from the cover and I wish, I wish, I wish it wasn\u2019t over. I long to go back\u2026\u2026.When Augustus came out on the porch the blue pigs were eating a rattlesnake \u2013 not a very big one. It had probably just been crawling around looking for shade when it ran into the pigs. They were having a fine tug-of-war with it, and its rattling days were over. The sow had it by the neck and the shoat by the tail. \u201cYou pigs git\u201d Augustus said kicking the shoat. \u201cHead on down to the creek if you want to eat that snake.\u201d It was the porch he begrudged them not the snake. Pigs on the porch just made things hotter and things were already hot enough. He stepped down into the dusty yard and walked around to the springhouse to get his jug. The sun was still high, sulled in the sky like a mule, but Augustus had a keen eye for sun, and to his eye the long light from the west had taken on an encouraging slant.And so it begins. I have read a number of different reviews; many of which discuss how long it took for them to get invested in the story. Not so for me, I gotta say that I latched on to Augustus McCrae pretty early on and even though I can feel, quite acutely, Captain Call\u2019s presence every time he crosses the page with Hell Bitch, it is Gus\u2019s company I seek on this trail. Makes sense I guess, I met him first, back in 1876 in Lonesome Dove, Texas. It has been quite a journey. Make no mistake; I spent time with all of the Hat Creek Cattle Company, not just the ex-rangers, as they drove their herd out of Texas and across the Great Plains, bound for Montana. I pined with Dish, listened to the Irish sing, and the remuda nicker and whinny. I ate dust with Newt on the heels of the herd and scouted for water and crossings with Deets. I was there for the water moccasins, the grizzlies and the cloud of grasshoppers, not to mention Blue Duck, one of the most frightening, sinister men ever; he made the hair on the back of my neck, my arms and everywhere else stand, stock still at attention. I seethed at Jake, swam with Pea Eye and felt Lorena\u2019s despair way down deep in my bones. I am just skimming the surface here, there are others with tales to tell, like July Johnson, the painfully shy sheriff from Arkansas, searching for his wife and Clara, the dark haired beauty with the scorching tongue in Nebraska, who may just sear you with her words.But back at the fire I would curl up and listen to Gus talk, reassured by his very presence, as we have a drink, play a hand or two and prepare to bed down. Amid all the words, in all the books, on all of the pages I have ever travelled, never before have I met a man so damn finely crafted, so carefully rendered, so agonizingly authentic as Augustus McCrae. It is as though I know him for real. Honestly. I enjoy his company and even now, miss his conversation. Yes, I want to go back\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Ride one more time with the Hat Creek Cattle Company, who don\u2019t rent pigs.I god, folks, seriously, what is happening here? I do not read westerns. Fact is, were I not a member of this wonderful on line community of book lovers, chances are pretty good that I would never have read this book. Do not make that mistake and yes, I Thank You one and all!"}, {"userName": "Manju", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11166121-manju", "userReview": "\u201cIf you read only one western novel in your life, read Lonesome Dove.\u201d\n\u2014USA TodayAbove statement seemed a bit too much to me before reading the book but not after reading it.My first time reading a Pulitzer winner and it is truly an epic story in every sense. A book that left me happy, sad, angry, and teary at times. Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call are two retired rangers who run a cattle company in a small town called Lonesome Dove. Whereas Augustus is very talkative Call is the opposite, talking only when it is necessary. An odd pair to be friends. Everything is going fine and suddenly out of nowhere an old friend, Jake Spoon, makes an appearance out of nowhere. Jake Spoon by mistake has murdered a doctor in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and is now wanted for same. Jake in his conversation tells Call about how he\u2019d been to Montana and its beauty. How green it is and there is no one to claim it. Call gets all anxious to be to first to claim it and soon he starts his journey from Texas to Montana with some 3000 cattle.I absolutely love the characters in the book. McMurtry has done a wonderful job in carving them. He has paid an equal attention to primary and secondary characters telling us about their backgrounds and how it effects their present. It\u2019s such a huge book and so many characters that at first I have a little trouble in remembering all in starting but soon I got addicted to them. I laughed with them, I cried with them, felt their pain, indecisiveness, sometimes I hated them for their foolishness but in the end I loved them all. This review will be incomplete if I didn\u2019t mention my favorite character from the book. & I think I am not alone in this, as far as I know he is everyone\u2019s favorite from the book. Augustus McCrae, a non-stop talker, someone who can argue on a subject for countless hours. Fellow rangers worship him, though not for his talkativeness, but for he is a good man. I came to love his truthfulness and boldness. He is blunt but also helpful. Someone who keep his promises and has a good heart. So a request to everyone who has this one on their tbr, please read it asap and if you don't have it on your tbr even then go ahead and read it for this is an awesome read."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "Retired Texas Rangers Woodrow F. Call and Augustus McCrae leave behind their sleepy lives in the Texas town of Lonesome Dove to drive a herd of cattle to Montana. Will they make it alive?When I was a lad, around the time the glaciers receded and civilization began, I was enthralled with a certain TV miniseries. It was, in fact, Lonesome Dove. Though it took a couple decades, I finally made myself read the book the miniseries was based on and I've very glad I did.Lonesome Dove is an epic set in the dying days of the Old West. On the surface, it's the story of two men entering old age and going on one last adventure. Digging a little deeper, it's a story about friendship, loyalty, obsession, and carving out a new place for yourself in a world that's moved on without you.The tale of a cattle drive across three thousand miles of prairie doesn't sound that interesting on the surface but McMurtry's tale is populated with a colorful cast of characters. Aging lady's man Augustus McCrae and duty-bound Captain Call contrast one another nicely. While being opposite in terms of personality, they both still have enough grit to be believable as former Texas Rangers and I have no trouble believing in their friendship.The supporting cast also has its share of gems, like gambler and former Texas Ranger Jake Spoon, Arkansas sheriff July Johnson, former whore Lorena Wood, Gus's former love Clara, and Newt, the son of a dead whore whose father has yet to acknowledge him. While the book has an epic scope, the shifting viewpoints and colorful characters make it very accessible and a quick read for a book of its size.While I'd seen the miniseries a couple times, this book managed to wring a few man-tears out of me. Knowing the deaths were coming made it harder somehow. I held out hope that a couple people would survive despite dying in the miniseries but it was not to be. The bottom line is that deep down, all men wish we had a friend that would haul our carcass from Montana to Texas if that was our dying request.Five out of five stars. Go read the son of a bitch."}, {"userName": "Joe Valdez", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez", "userReview": "My introduction to the fiction of Larry McMurtry is Lonesome Dove, consistently ranked as one of the best westerns whether the conversation is print or television. Published the year of the Texas Sesquicentennial in 1985 and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction the following year, the magnum opus is a magnificent exploration of male friendship, with a dozen supporting characters of both genders who McMurtry could've dedicated a novella to (and often attempts to over 857 pages). The bantering becomes a beast of its own and the story padding crosses over into self-indulgence, but there's no question that there's a masterful novel in here.Somewhere along the border of Texas and Mexico in the late 1870s lies the town of Lonesome Dove, which consists of little more than a dry saloon and a livery stable. The stable is operated by two retired Texas Rangers: a romantic idler named Augustus McCrae and the taciturn, hard driving Captain Woodrow F. Call. A two-time widower and a bachelor, respectively, the men lead Joshua Deets (a black scout from their rangering days), Peaeye Parker (an ex-ranger who is loyal but none too bright), Newt Dobbs (the seventeen year old progeny of a prostitute and in all likelihood, Call) and Bolivar (an ill-tempered cook who enjoys clanging the dinner bell with a crowbar).Having dedicated their prime to eliminating the threat of Comanche Indians or Mexican bandits to Texas, Gus and Call have spent nine years operating the Hat Creek Cattle Company, stabling horses, stealing fresh ones south of the border for sale and little else. When he's not drinking whiskey on the porch or jawing, Augustus visits the Dry Bean for a card game or a poke with the town's sporting lady, a cool blonde named Lorena Wood who dreams of traveling to San Francisco, but needs a dependable man to get her there. Call, whose favorite pastime is sitting at the river crossing after dinner hoping he might catch a horse thief, hungers for a challenge.Call was not a man to daydream--that was Gus's department--but then it wasn't really daydreaming he did, alone on the little bluff at night. It was just thinking back to the years when a man who presumed to stake out a Comanche trail would do well to keep his rifle cocked. Yet the fact that he had taken to thinking back annoyed him, too: he didn't want to start working over his memories, like an old man. Sometimes he would force himself to get up and walk two or three more miles up the river and back, just to get the memories out of his head. Not until he felt alert again--felt that he could still captain if the need arose--would he return to Lonesome Dove.The next morning, Deets returns from San Antonio with Jake Spoon, a comrade from their rangering days whose love for ladies and aversion to work has led him to a career as a gambler. Jake had overstayed his welcome in Fort Smith, Arkansas when an argument with a mule skinner led to the accidental shooting of the town dentist, brother to the sheriff. Jake beats it to Lonesome Dove for the protection of his old friends. Lorena falls under the spell of the rogue, wounding the heart of a top cowhand named Dish Boggett who's in love with her, while Call is seduced by Jake's tales of pristine territory he's scouted in Montana, wide open to a ranching operation.Receiving an order for forty horses from a cattleman driving his herd to Nebraska, the men cross into Mexico, where it's Call's mission to steal one hundred horses, buy some cattle and drive them to Montana to make their own fortune. Their stolen ponies collide with a herd driven south by horse thieves, multiplying their holdings. Call begins hiring hands and convinces Gus--who realizes there won't be anyone left to talk to but the pigs--to come along on the journey. Jake prefers a card game to work or to keeping his promise to take Lorena to San Francisco, but Gus convinces him to accompany her and them as far as Denver, knowing it would satisfy Lorena, entertain himself and infuriate Call.Dangers on the trail include sand storms, stampedes, lightning strikes, nests of water moccasins in a swollen river and a barbarous Comanchero named Blue Duck, who abducts Lorena while Jake is off gambling. Rescued by Gus, her recovery is complicated by the discovery that he intends to reunite with an old flame in Nebraska named Clara Allen, the love he never got over. Meanwhile, a young sheriff from Fort Smith named July Johnson goes to Texas with his stepson Joe to bring Jake Spoon to justice. His hapless deputy Roscoe Brown goes after them once his boss's wife Elmira Boot Johnson promptly vanishes, headed for Nebraska with buffalo hunters to find her first husband.The whiskey boat stank, and the men on it stank, but Elmira was not sorry she had taken the passage. She had a tiny little cubbyhole among the whiskey casks, with a few planks and some buffalo skins thrown over it to keep the rain out, but she spent most of her time sitting at the rear of the boat, watching the endless flow of brown water. Some days were so hot that the air above the water shimmered and the shore become indistinct; others days a chill rain blew and she wrapped herself in one of the buffalo robes and kept fairly dry. The rain was welcome, for it discouraged the fleas. They made her sleep uneasy, but it was a small price to pay for escaping from Fort Smith. She had lived where there were fleas before, and worse things than fleas.McMurtry's indulgences with epic storytelling and the tendency of his minor characters to behave like idiots--their misplaced devotion leading them on foolhardy quests in pursuit of lovers who want nothing more of them--seem to go hand in hand. I could have done without the July Johnson and Elmira Boot subplots. McMurtry's banter as instigated by Gus is often amusing, sometimes profound, but there's too much of it. The overkill is balanced by the tremendous appeal of Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call, the archetypal visionary and practical man. Their company is stocked with archetypes I recognized, co-workers who were far from Texas Rangers or even cowboys but exhibited many of the same qualities as Deets, Pea or Jake Spoon.McMurtry's facility with dialogue, character and description all brought to bear on Lonesome Dove. In addition to his terrific banter-- where men debate whether it is pigs or horses who are smarter or work through the great mysteries of women or death--I liked how devoted McMurtry was to exploring the relationship between two men. Like a marriage, Gus and Call love each other, but are getting fed up. I saw quite a bit of myself in the character of Woodrow Call, a gift for an author to pull off. As antagonists go, Blue Duck has no equal. The period detail is spare but I felt I had an extremely clear proscenium on what the Old West was like as McMurtry took me through it.In 1972 after adapting his novel The Last Picture Show to screen, Larry McMurtry was approached by its director Peter Bogdanovich to script a western for him. The Streets of Laredo was envisioned as a deconstruction, with cowboys facing their mortality. The conceit was to cast James Stewart, John Wayne and Henry Fonda as Gus, Call and Jake Spoon but Wayne had second thoughts about razing the genre he helped build and the project stalled. Twelve years later, McMurtry bought the rights to his script treatment and developed Lonesome Dove. Its publishing success spurred an acclaimed four-part television mini-series on CBS in 1989 with Robert Duvall as Gus, Tommy Lee Jones as Call, Danny Glover as Deets, the enduring Diane Lane as Lorena and Robert Urich as Jake Spoon."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "I enjoy reading: but McMurtry asks way too much. This epic tale spans thousands of miles from the Old West (Texas) to the as-of-yet-up-for-grabs land of Montana. The characters are endearing; these are the premiere & authentic cowboys. The best stuff here is the campfire philosophy of Gus, and his incredible relationship with the solemn Woodrow Call is the stuff that legend is made of. The book refuses to end though, and despite the authenticity of this far away world (it is the Lord of the Rings of Western classics), I could not help but feel that the different story lines, of the outlaws, whores and fellow pioneers went nowhere. (A life lesson in everything?) Would the plot have suffered if more chapters had been edited out? (Perhaps the bigness is part of the whole Lonesome Dove experience.)

By far one of the best I\u2019ve read, Lonesome Dove is a dense book in more ways than one, and runs a gamut of emotions that will leave you feeling giddy. Hysterically funny the one moment, heartbreakingly tragic the next, it alternately delighted and depressed me to an extent I have seldom experienced before (in so far as literary fiction is concerned). [He] didn\u2019t cry, but he was so shaken he went weak in the legs.It is also one of the most complete novels I have ever read, and you have to read it cover to cover before fully appreciating its power. It isn\u2019t just a tale about a cattle drive to Montana\u2026 it is a tale about transitions, the passing of time, and the ending of (all) things.They were on a plain of grass so huge that it was hard to imagine there was a world beyond it.The herd, and themselves, were like a dot, surrounded by endless grass.If the book is sometimes a bit gritty or raw, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a tale of hard folk making a hard living in hard country. Lonesome Dove is an occasionally hilarious, occasionally bleak glimpse at frontier life (and frontier justice), and it may not be what you expected. You will come away from this one deeply affected, for better or worse. It will also make you think. A lot.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s been so long since I done anything right that I can\u2019t remember it.\u201dThe characters are marvellously colourful and often larger than life. In fact, the author should be applauded for managing to keep them from coming across as caricatures. Even though the story itself is fascinating, the fantastic characterisation undoubtedly forms the very foundation of this novel. It\u2019s hard not to love a story that revolves around the likes of Captains Woodrow Call and Augustus McCrae, polar opposites and saddle buddies. Not to mention the fantastically endearing supporting cast.The Captain turned and handed him a holstered pistol and a gun belt.\u201cBetter to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.\u201dIt\u2019s a big book and I\u2019m guessing many of us have had this lying around for ages, but you really should make the time to read it. It\u2019s worth every minute. Something that is worth a mention: the author has the uncanny ability to seamlessly change character viewpoints mid stride, which gives the story a nice flow. Highly, highly recommended.\u201cWhy would you want to hang them? They\u2019re already dead.\u201d\u201cI know, but it\u2019s a shame to waste that tree.

But pretty in the sunlight.During a recent trip to the local bookstore, a discount stack of Lonesome Dove caught my distracted eye. Picking up a copy, I randomly flipped through to read three separate passages. And like an amnesiac, I promptly forgot all about the books I sought to find in the first place. Because this here was the book I didn\u2019t know I needed to read right now.At its core is a simple enough story\u2014an epic cattle drive, not long after the Civil War, from southern Texas to northern Montana\u2014but there\u2019s nothing simple or subtle about the effects the various undercurrent narratives had on me. As wild and raw as the vivid landscapes were continuously invoked, it is with the characters where this novel truly excels. Among a handful of major characters, I often forgot many of them were constructs made of words. That they seemed more real than the sum of a limited amount of words continually amazed me. Even minor characters came to life quickly and lingered long after exiting stage left, leaving behind solemn shadows.Death and humor are doled out abundantly and in roughly equal measures, striking a necessary balance. For as commonly as death occurs, it often occurs violently. Not quite with the same force-fed frequency as found in Blood Meridian, but at times on the same level of intensity. That\u2019s where the humor here helps temper the unexpected and ubiquitous death. More than a good deal of this book\u2019s humor emanates from one, if not the main character\u2014Augustus McCrae. A man\u2026I mean, a fictional character not likely to leave my thoughts anytime soon. Crowding around Gus in this harsh and brutal world are many other prominent characters, not least of all a couple of especially strong-willed women woven into the essence of this long tale. As long as this story may be, it reads more like a novella, so quickly do the pages fly by. And when the last page passes, it passes by without complete closure\u2014highlighting the way we all experience life outside these books. Life coming and going, surrounding everyone until abandoning us one by one. As though death were life\u2019s joke on us all."}, {"userName": "Maciek", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek", "userReview": "[McMurty says that he thought of Newt as being the Lonesome Dove: an innocent, young and lonesome man, never recognized by his father. But I think that basically all characters are unable to form a relationship - Call refuses to acknowledge that Newt is his son because and give him his name, and is \"afraid to admit that he's human\"; Lorena is a dreamer, captured by the vision of San Francisco, refusing to pay attention to the feelings of men in the town of Lonesome Dove; Gus is unable to settle down anywhere and have a meaningful relationship with anyone; he was rejected by Clara because of that. Clara is unable to have a son as they all died early; her husband also dies, leaving her alone on the prairie with their two daughters. Even the Mexicans, Bolivar and Po Campo are alone - Bolivar is separated from his family in Mexico and has a strained - putting it mildly -relationship with them. Po Campo is a loner, who keeps mostly to himself. It is perhaps the reason why these characters form a bond, and reach out bravely for the unexplored frontier, hoping for it to be the land of happiness, where their dreams would be realized.

Really. What do we care? Here is what we do with Lonesome Dove and Gone With the Wind. We read them.Half way through Lonesome Dove Augustus McCrae rides into the breaks of the Canadian River. He is tracking Blue Duck who has kidnapped Lorena. He comes upon an old adversary, Aus Frank, a former mountain man and ineffectual bank robber, in the middle of nowhere. Aus is collecting buffalo bones that are scattered as far as the eye can see. He is loading them in his wheelbarrow, wheeling them across the plains, and then piling them up in enormous pyramids in the Canadian valley. Only Aus himself would know the reason for this work. Perhaps old Aus does not know.I am not going to compare and contrast Larry McMurtry with Cormac McCarthy in his southwestern phase. Nonetheless, that image is the equal of any that Cormac McCarthy ever created.The scene causes Augustus to ponder:Soon the whites would come, of course, but what he was seeing was a moment between, not the plains as they had been, or as they would be, but a moment of true emptiness, with thousands of miles of grass resting unused, occupied only by remnants\u2014of the buffalo, the Indians, the hunters. Augustus thought they were crazed remnants, mostly, like the old mountain man who worked night and day gathering bones to no purpose.That is the setting for Lonesome Dove, the brief \u201cin between time\u201d in the West. Captain McCrae and Captain Call of the Texas Rangers are themselves remnants and a bit crazed, too. They launch out into this \u201cin between time,\u201d Augustus only reluctantly, with a vast herd of cattle and a remuda, some collected in Texas and some stolen in M\u00e9xico, and with a ragtag collection of cowboys head north to a vague destination called \u201cMontana.\u201dI may still be under the spell of the story, but as a masterpiece of its kind. It is a captivating story, populated with vivid characters, and well told.By the way, a problem has been solved. A mystery is no longer a mystery.You will recall that in the beginning of Lonesome Dove, Augustus fashions a sign for the Hat Creek Cattle Company and Livery Emporium. A man who valued education, Gus felt compelled to add a Latin motto to the sign. Even though he had no idea what it meant, he chose, \"Uva uvam vivendo varia fit.\" [Emphasis mine.:] He chose that motto only because he thought it looked right.This has bothered me for years because Larry McMurtry never tells us what this Latin motto means. I have finally figured it out. Gus mispelled videndo, carving vivendo into the sign instead. Therein lies the problem.Uva uvam videndo varia fit literally means, \"A grape changes color in seeing another grape.\" The sense of it is, \"a bad friend makes you a bad person,\" or \"a good friend makes you a good person.\" No need to thank me."}, {"userName": "Lynne King", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king", "userReview": "When Augustus came out of the porch the blue pigs were eating a rattlesnake \u2013 not a very big one. It had probably just been crawling around looking for shade when it ran into pigs. They were having a fine tug-of-war with it, and its rattling days were over. The sow had it by the neck, and the shoat had the tail.\nI\u2019ve had a first here in that I\u2019ve done a complete U-turn on a book. I had serious doubts from page 1, especially when I read the above opening paragraph. Rattlesnakes, sows and young pigs. Did I really need this? Well yes I had to continue and I managed to convince myself because this is a Pulitzer prize-winning novel and I couldn\u2019t have got it that wrong...Surely?I loved and yet hated the continuing text. Yes, it was indeed beautifully written and then I arrived at page 40:First of all I must mention that Lorena Wood is a \u201csporting woman\u201d and you need to know her background. What a wonderful title she had, such a euphemism, and I immediately started thinking of jockeys. Her favours are well, available to all at a price. I didn\u2019t initially like this but she\u2019s a survivor, in the Wild West and has to earn a living. She cannot live on air can she and so there are mitigating circumstances and after all we are here in Texas in the 1870s. A worrying time in the west and the Indians were still there (scalping as part of their fun \u2013 although I would have thought that scalping is quite difficult to achieve), although not as much, as in the past maintaining their space. Comanches I believe; hunter-gatherers with a horse culture. There were others but not in great numbers. They had systematically been annihilated by \u201cforeigners\u201d to the US.After a meeting getting involved with Tinkersley (a big mistake) he ended up biting her:The bite had left a faint scar just above her upper lip; to Lorena\u2019s amusement it was this trifling scar that seemed to make men crazy for a time with her. Of course, it wasn\u2019t just the scar \u2013 she had developed well and had also gotten prettier as she got older. But the scar played its part. Tinkersley got drunk in Lonesome Dove the day he left her, and he told everyone in the Dry Bean (that\u2019s the one and only saloon in Lonesome Dove) that she was a murderous woman. So she had a reputation in town before she even unpacked her clothes. Tinkersley had left her with no money at all, but fortunately she could cook when she had to. The Dry Bean was the only place in Lonesome Dove that served food and Lorena had been able to talk to Xavier Wanz, who owned it, into letting her do the cooking until the cowboys got over being scared of her and began to approach her.But then can you blame a woman for taking this profession? She\u2019s on a continual carousel full of men, looking at survival because here she is in in the Wild West, hoping that she will eventually get to the land of her dreams, San Francisco.Augustus (Gus) McCrae, a partner in the Hat Creek company (owner with W.F. Call - both former Texas rangers) comes into the equation. OK, so Gus has need of a \u201cpoke\u201d from time to time but when I come across a new meaning for \u201ccarrots\u201d, well as far as I was concerned, that was enough.I\u2019m still completely unaware of what happened here but I went to bed, couldn\u2019t sleep, took a cup of coffee, with my beloved honey of course, and began rereading this book. My mind seemed to keep on thinking of the excellent sections I had read and so back to page 1. I was reformed.I soon learned to love these two partners, Gus and Call. They were so different. Gus liked to eat (he could finish a meal in ten minutes \u2013 my!), to talk, to \u201cpoke\u201d and contradict everyone but I soon ascertained that he had a heart of gold. Call was taciturn, a real cuss, solitary but basically a good individual.The two of them argued but after a lot of hassle it was agreed that they would take a herd of cattle, around 3,000 (achieved by rustling, etc.) to Montana and perhaps settle there.But there\u2019s such a plethora of individuals, to quote but a few:Jake Spoon - a former Texas Ranger and a dashing gambler who lives a \u201clove \u2018em and leave \u2018em.Newt Dobbs - A seventeen year old boy who has lived for ten years with Call and McCrae, he desperately desires to know who his father is and to be taken seriously as a cowboy.Josh Deets - A black man and an excellent hand for the Hat Creek Company, he has known Call and Gus since their Ranger days. He is probably more competent at his job than any of the white men in the company.Pea Eye Parker -The most loyal member of the Hat Creek Cattle Company, Pea Eye is not the smartest of the group, but he would die for Call and Gus if they asked him. He has a hard time with change, but turns to his work whenever he feels confused about the loss of what he comes to know best.Plus our friends, the animals, horses (Call\u2019s horse, Hell Bitch, completely uncontrollable as an example), pigs, bulls, bears, etc.. I cannot go through all of them.The one thing that does stick in my mind is that Gus only agreed to go on this trip because the love of his life, Clara Allen is now married to a comatose husband and is keeping their horse farm together and her place was en route to Montana.This is life at its grimmest in parts. The section with Sean and the water moccasins completely took me off guard and especially the ending with Gus. So unexpected.But I must add that I\u2019m always intrigued by the titles of books and I kept on wondering why Mr McMurty had decided on this particular one.And the reason? \u201c\u2026.. after the Lonesome Dove Baptist Church in Southlake. He was out dining with a friend when he saw the church and decided that it would be a good name for the town in his novel. The Lonesome Dove Baptist Church, in turn, was founded in 1846 when Baptist preacher David Meyers was preaching in an arbor near Grapevine and a dove flew down and lighted on his shoulder. He took it as a sign and built they built the church on that very spot.Nevertheless, back to this wondrous epic western that I would not have missed for the world. I felt as though I were sitting in the cinema throughout the entire book; all that was lacking was the accompanying thrilling music. A completely unexpected; enthralling book to be reread as I\u2019ve already done."}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "4.5/5 stars.

The relationship between the two old Texas Rangers, Call and McCrae has to be one of my favourites in all literature. Both are brilliant character studies of archetypal men \u2013 Cal, infuriatingly silent, emotionally shy, almost retarded in his refusal to allow feeling, McCrae, prone to excess drinking, lazy and vain about his scant erudition. The bond they share becomes more and more moving as the novel progresses. It\u2019s one of the great (entirely platonic) love stories about two men. Essentially about a cattle drive Lonesome Dove has all the profundity of an ancient myth like The Odyssey or even the Divine Comedy because at heart it\u2019s a story about venturing into the unknown with only your wits to offer protection against the perils. It\u2019s not just the two main characters who are so brilliantly developed, so compelling and ultimately so loveable despite their flawed complexities; there is a whole cast of such characters in this novel. The set-pieces, perfectly timed to sustain the excitement of the plot, are fantastically alive and vivid and moving. An early example of this is the young boy who rides into a nest of poisonous river snakes. The range of emotion McMurtry forces you to feel in this scene is dazzling.  I\u2019m not American and have never been there but I felt this novel explained the young heart of America to me better than perhaps any other novel I\u2019ve read. It read like the depiction of the beginning of a civilisation. But never is McMurtry guilty of romanticising the past. You feel this is exactly how it must have been. Another brilliant touch is the young man who is more terrified of talking to women then any danger the prairies hold. Lonesome Dove is epic in the most exalted sense of the term."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/170228-mary", "userReview": "Thanks, Broadway street-book dude.

No Faulknerian pretensions, no torture-porn, no dogged insistence upon rendering the West as a nightmare-landscape of irredeemable violence and sorrow.

And while I\u2019m fairly new to the genre, I would wholeheartedly agree. This is a quintessential American tale. Really what\u2019s more American, than striking out into parts unknown to make a fresh go of it? This country was founded by explorers, thrill-seekers, risk-takers; it\u2019s in our DNA, our blood & bones. And what better place to tackle, than that last, vast, unsettled, western frontier? This story, for the most part, is much more of a character study, than a purely plot driven narrative. Often conveyed at a leisurely pace, with some nice touches of humor sprinkled throughout. There\u2019s also the occasional shocking switch from that mellow laid back adventure to scenes of graphic & brutal violence which made my blood surge, pulse race, hair stand on end. I had the good fortune to be joined on this adventure, by a few of my compa\u00f1eros from that super-secret, off the record, on the Q.T. and very Hush-Hush organization, whose name must not be spoken. At times it felt as though they were riding along, right there with me. So to round out this character study, I figured what better tribute, than to insert \u2019em right here into our story. Let\u2019s do a little casting call, shall we?For the role of Augustus McCrae, who better than Kemper himself? Granted, these are some mighty big boots to fill; however, ole Kemper might just have a large enough ego & dry wit required to pull it off. Augustus, or Gus as his friends call him, is a former legendary Texas Ranger who, along with his crew, have cleaned out all them pesky Indians, paving the way for them bankers & homesteaders to move on in. So you\u2019ll have to pardon his lazy attitude, and loud mouth, cause he\u2019s paid his debt, and there\u2019s a hell of lot more to life than work. His main agitation these days, besides that blazing hot sun, is the fact that the rest of the outfit\u2019s a damn bunch of dull witted mutes. Hell, he\u2019s so bored at times he\u2019d argue with a stump. And the only thing bigger than his mouth & ego, is his insatiable thirst for whiskey, women, and cards. In the role of Clara Allen how about Kemper\u2019s GR foil, Trudi? One of the only women cagey enough to outwit ole Gus, and spurn all most of his affections. Hell, she plumb run off halfway across the country and married some dullard, just to get his goat. She\u2019s suffered thru many hardships, over the years, and more than her fair share of heartbreak, but her spirit remains unbroken. She\u2019s as tough as nails. Opinionated & outspoken, but boy ain\u2019t she got a sass mouth? That\u2019ll leave Becky with the sporting role of Lorena Wood. *Ducks* Hey, there\u2019s only so many roles for women here, sorry. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re probably better suited to the role of Janey (slinging rocks, and chasing down varmints), but sadly her screen time was rather limited. So you gotta work with me here, and fear not, we won\u2019t judge you based on your line of work. Look, you made the best of a bad situation. What\u2019s a girl to do? Plus, check out all those dumb cowpokes ogling ya over yonder. Don\u2019t worry, most them boys is too nervous to even approach you, let alone try & set their post. And I know you\u2019ve grown weary of gardening, but can\u2019t you at least find the heart to let a few of them boys bury some carrots?As Gus\u2019s right hand man, and fellow Ranger, it\u2019s none other than our stoic captain Woodrow Call, played by the rather stoic Dan version 1.0. He ain\u2019t much like other men, he don\u2019t suffer the same weaknesses & vices. And he damn sure won\u2019t admit to having made no mistakes. He\u2019s content to keep to himself; keep the rest of the world at arm\u2019s length. And who can blame him, with all that relentless needling & pestering Gus doles out. All work & no play makes Call a dull boy, but with that dullness comes natural born leadership. You best not get on his bad side neither, cause trust me when I say, it won\u2019t end well for you. He must have one hell of a constitution to tolerate 30 yrs of Gus\u2019s incessant babbling. To top it all off he\u2019s the most loyal, and honorable friend any man could ever hope for. Sadly, it appears I\u2019ve shoehorned myself squarely into the role of Newt Dobbs, the pup of the Outfit. All wide eyed, and full of youthful exuberance, ready to grab the world by the tail. Wishing & hoping for the day when I\u2019m finally old enough to go on one of them horse thieving trips with the Captain. I\u2019m just eager for that grand new adventure, hell anything to get me out of this desert wasteland. I sure wish Ma was still alive, or I at least knew who my old Pa was, but it\u2019s a safe bet 1.0 won\u2019t be claiming me any time soon.

Feeling\u2026Feelings\u2026Does not compute. Oh lookie here, I see one last straggler bringing up the rear. My Lord, if it ain\u2019t old Richard, in the role of Po Campo. Just in time Po, seeing as how we\u2019re in need of a new cook. I think our last one\u2019s gone down to Mexico to shoot his wife! Po here\u2019s wise beyond his years, and that\u2019s saying something cause he appears to be old as dirt. He sure don\u2019t miss much, walking along back of the wagon with them pigs. Seems to know a bit about everything too, and rankles Gus with all that wisdom, and masterful cooking. He\u2019s for dern sure one hell of a cook, but I think I\u2019ll have to pass on them grasshoppers. I see we run outta compa\u00f1eros here, with still plenty of choice roles to fill. So why don\u2019t you do yourself a favor partner, and mosey on down to Lonesome Dove. We got a nice little snake ranch, out here in the sun-scorched, dusty, chaparral lands of south Texas. We\u2019re just a hair north of Old Mexico. We might even sell you some horses or cattle, but we don\u2019t rent pigs! We could always use a few more good hands to round out our crew. Hustle up now, cause we\u2019ve got to get a move on this cattle drive. Look for the Hat Creek outfit; don\u2019t worry you can\u2019t miss our sign. Tl;dr - Sorry for you. And what no gifs?

Never before have I said this about a book because I LOVE BIG CASTS (Stephen King fanboy, remember?), but this book's cast is ridiculously (shuddup Dan 2.0) huge for no good reason. 245 pages in, McMurtry abandons the characters it took me almost 300 pages to get used to in order to introduce another group of motherfuckers and a wife leaving a sheriff who's the brother of a man Jake Spoon killed because some chick named Peach told him to because FUCK YOU!And, no, kiddos, I don't give a stream of piss (but our president-elect would) if the author returns to the other motherfuckers. I don't care. You hear me? I don't fucking care. I didn't like those cocksuckers either. Only bastard I halfway gave a shit about was Call and he barely ever talks and when he does talk it's only to argue with Gus BECAUSE NOTHING EVER HAPPENS IN THIS GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING BOOK! At one point the characters even joke about how there's nothing to do but argue. Even a motherfucking chapter about a raid and stealing horses is jesuschristing boring. How the fuck do you make stealing horses fucking boring? I don't care. This book is godfucked boring. I don't want to read it anymore. If you loved it and think it's the bestest thing since golden pussy and platinum dick, good on you, but I have zero clue what the fuck you see in the meandering hunk of shit.Sorry to Dan (not 2.0, but the original). I know you loved this novel, in fact, you're the one who spurred me to read it. But no. I still have mad respect for you, dude, but no. No. NO!In summation: Go fuck yourself. It would be infinitely more enjoyable than reading this book. *pictures you trying to fuck yourself and giggles* Love you. smoochesFinal Judgment: I haven't been wrong in awhile, so here you go."}, {"userName": "smetchie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/187563-smetchie", "userReview": "Now this is a book.

GET ON IT!"}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "This is a book worth reading. It's simple yet complex, it's beautiful but cruel, and it's filled with the type of characters that are real and flawed and human. There's a bleakness to this book that is interspersed with life and humor at the most necessary of times, which was surprising and delightful. It was long, and I traveled far in this book, but now that I'm done with it, I kinda just have the urge to cry because I'm not sure I wanted it to be over. I kinda loved this book. Gus and Call are two of the best characters I've read about in a long time, and their interactions were both awkward and familiar. Throughout the whole book, I loved Gus. I love that there's a depth to him, but he's honest and forthcoming in his way about it, and is confident enough in himself that he sees no reason not to be. And he certainly doesn't put up with bullshit. It's refreshing to see someone so comfortable with who they are. At the same time, I wasn't quite sure what to make of Call. He's the strong, silent type, a man who sees work to be done everywhere, and does it because someone has to. He is not a typical man, and has no regard for the things that men of his acquaintance enjoy - drinking, playing cards, and whoring. He holds himself apart because it's more comfortable for him in the quiet where he can think, and also NOT think. For he's not an introspective man. He has his regrets, sure, but he would rather ignore them and not analyze his life down to the nuts and bolts. He does what needs to be done, and that's that. But somewhere along the way, maybe around the time that they hit Nebraska, I started to understand Call. Well, maybe not to understand him... I'm still not sure I could claim that, but I did accept him and relate to him in some ways. I think it was Clara's harsh opinion of him that solidified it for me. I felt bad for him, so at a loss as to how to even talk to her to buy horses, and she so sure that he was condescendingly waiting for her to lower her price. I just wanted to shake her and ask why she could accept everyone else and give them the benefit of the doubt... but not him? And their second meeting... Oh my. She's a hard one. So cruel. He's a hard man to understand, and I'm quite sure that he would be a hard man to live with, but when they make Montana but lose so much in the process... it just broke my heart for him. I loved him in the last moments he had with the people he lost. It was hard for him to speak, and to say that things that anyone else would have said, but he felt them. And his loyalty is beautiful to me, even though it's completely unappreciated and scorned by everyone else. And now I'm sitting here crying over this as I type it, because dammit, he deserves better than that!But, as Gus says, \"It's a fine world, though rich in hardships at times.\" So true. I loved the descriptions of the country and the towns, and reading this felt less like looking at a page than living on the plains with these men. I could feel the grass, and the wind, and the dust in the air when it kicked up. I could smell the rain, and hear the grasshoppers and the cows and the horses whinnying. I was fascinated by the sky - a sky I have only seen without airplanes in it one time - and how open the world beneath it was. I felt the thirst of riding for days without water, and I enjoyed the freedom of possibility and risks of danger through these men. I'm sorry to let this world go, honestly. It wasn't easy to ride with the Hat Creek outfit, but I loved every minute of it."}, {"userName": "Mariel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647547-mariel", "userReview": "My ex gave me this book with written notes in the margins of the book. He started reading it, anyway, and gave up. I've read that it is supposedly \"slow\" in the beginning, but I didn't feel that way. It's exactly the kind of directly into the psyche style of writing I crave the most (if the change in perspectives took time to get used to, ultimately it was complimentary of the other). I'm gonna have to buy a fresh copy... Okay, some people thought that The Wire was a slow burn and I never did. If I feel understanding and want to get to know those people, I'm gonna keep on. The something happening is the peices of the puzzle you can only put together when you have all the peices. (Unless there are millions of white or sky peices and then puzzles are a pain in the ass. Oops, forgot what I was talking about.) For example: [selected randomly] one of the first pages says stuff like this: \"The man never wasted five minutes appreciating himself; it would have meant losing five minutes off whatever job he had decided he wanted to get done that day.\" That's getting to know you stuff. Or: \"If he felt he had to go off and sit in the dark every night, he must think it important.\" Their kind of thinking makes sense in the get inside your head perspectives. I'd recommend sticking with it and getting hooked, line and sinker and then the hook never comes out of your mouth. (I could keep running with this and say stuff about gasping like a fish on land, if I were the metaphorical sort. Lonesome Dove hit me hard. Reading reviews of Lonesome Dove is me nodding vigorously \"Yeah, I get that!\" like the coolest book club I've never been a member of (I'm not into book clubs 'cause I'm too moody to read at set times). I'd wanna have a secret hand shake if I could. [I've only got one secret handshake in my repertoire. It's a signal my twin and I use to indicate that we are not fans of The Rock aka Dwayne Johnson. It's rock paper scissors and both parties land on paper. Cuz paper kills rock.] Cool clubs won't have me. (I dig that Woody Allen attributed a quote to Groucho Marx instead of to Mark Twain like everybody else seems to. I wouldn't want to belong to a club that'd have me as a member. This one doesn't get a choice 'cause this is the one of the (many) natures of Lonesome Dove. So I don't know what I can add, really, but this is one of those wowzers of a book that knocked me over and took over my life. I gotta pay tribute to that. That doesn't happen every day. Pick anything like \"It should have lasted forever.\" \"These characters are my best friends.\" \"I lost sleep over it.\" This is the true meaning of those words, like the first time Hamlet said \"To be or not to be\". Who cares if infinity times infinity squared high school kids said it later until point of cliche. Mark Twain's review will be better than mine... Lonesome Dove is the small town you get stuck in on the way to anywhere else. No one means to stay there. Their life mistakes are like that too, but not in the METAPHORICAL way, 'cause McMurtry knows that it's not about messages to those living it. They gotta get through it first. The war is over, things are changing. The past scars remain and the old ghosts exist on top of the ones coming, on top of the daily vision and what has to get done. It's fucking up and fighting and fucking and roadtrip story and true love bromance friendship before there were defining words like bromance (Call and McCray certainly wouldn't have used that word. They'd not define it at all). Inability to have a relationship with a woman because it would call for defining. The women in their knowledge are prostitutes (Lorena is one of my favorites of my \"happyhookers\" shelf). It's losing the future (that you might not ever have had coming to you) of the land, encroaching loss of freedoms, loneliness of choices, bad choices. (I'm starting to see a common thread in my favorite books and films.) I relate Lonesome Dove to so much what is happening today, and what could happen as the world seems to get smaller, freedoms less. I know about problems with keeping connections and those damned labels. It's awesome that a western is the book that calls out this shit when the Western genre was often known to be this good ole days myth about what was actually pretty fucked up times, not this movie star camera shot action glory. D'oh forgot to mention that the other characters are those people you know on the job that you don't always think about and take for granted. I didn't feel they were marginalized, just written in that working-view."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "[ Newt is the son of Woodrow, but his father refuses to unbend and to acknowledge him, despite insistent urgings from Gus and from other members of the crew.

Too crass. Here is what I learned before flushing the book down the toilet:Definition of a cowpoke, a cowboy who can\u2019t keep his carrot in his pants long enough to move cattle from point A to point B, and all because they brought a woman on a cattle drive. I will never look at the word \u201ccarrot\u201d or \u201cpoke\u201d in the same way again.After one hundred pages, a couple of reviewers said that this book picks up. No, it doesn\u2019t. It is like real life, some days are boring and some aren\u2019t, and we all know that most days fall under the former. Nine hundred plus pages of this, and I find myself reading other books.Some say this is better than the TV series. What? Is this because of the woman who goes on the cattle drive? I didn\u2019t want to have to listen to a bunch of men constantly thinking about this woman that they are bringing on the trip.They don\u2019t even leave Lonesome Dove until some time after page 200, which is where I am at this moment. Movies can take a slow burning book and speed it up. I can take slow burning book and throw it into our woodstove to warm us up this winter and then watch the movie again.But of course I did not flush the book down the toilet or burn it since it is on my kindle, where it will stay for now. Who knows, maybe I will take a hankering to read it again so I can come back on here and complain about it some more. What else can I say about his book? Good character study and so I liked all the people, mostly men, even the prostitute was likeable, but it could use some more cow poking, oops. That was not intentional.
