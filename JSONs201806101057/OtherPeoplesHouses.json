There\u2019s also a lot of gossip, drama, and snarkiness! \nIt\u2019s hard to write a summary due to multiple POVs and plotlines, so I am just going to focus on the main ones.Frances, or \u201cSaint Frances\u201d as some of the bitchy soccer moms refer to her, is the main voice of the novel. Frances runs the neighborhood carpool, happily carting off the children of three other neighbors on a daily basis to and from multiple schools. She is the glue that not only holds her own family together, but also that of many neighbors. Wanting to constantly lend a helping hand, she sometimes oversteps boundaries and inserts herself into the drama of her friends and neighbors. Of course she has some flaws, and her weight is the focus of a lot of discussion. I could have lived without this aspect of her character, as it felt cliched. When Frances walks in on her neighbor Anne in a compromising position, she struggles to be a supportive friend. Anne\u2019s family implodes, resulting in more neighborhood drama. Anne and her husband also have main POV\u2019s, as does Frances\u2019s cousin, Iris, and her wife, Sara.What I really like about Other People\u2019s Houses is that it feels very realistic, with all the good, the bad, and the ugly that goes on behind closed doors mixed in. As I wrote above, Frances is the driving force, but the blurb made it seem more like the focus was going to be about Anne, and while Anne\u2019s story takes up a good chunk really it\u2019s about Frances. I found the narrative to be a little uneven--I wanted more from some characters, and less from Frances. I also wish the characters were a little bit more nuanced and less cliched. Overall this was an enjoyable, entertaining read.Thank you to Elisah at Berkley Publishing Group for sending me an ARC!"}, {"userName": "Berit\u2600\ufe0f\u2728Traveling Sister\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38946743-berit-traveling-sister", "userReview": "4.5 Wonderful and Snarky stars \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f.5From the minute I picked up this book I was sucked into the lives of these characters....

I found so much of this book so relevant and laughably true.... The scene in this book at the PTA meeting where they were debating Cotillion lessons had me in tears... The struggle is real!Francis is the glue that holds this book together as well as the neighborhood.... she drives all the neighborhood kids to school, is always there for everybody when they need her, and is always putting everybody else before herself.... she also had a sense of humor about herself, her family, her life, and the world in general, I always love that in a character.... if Francis and I were to live on the same block we would absolutely be friends and she would never find me on my living room floor in a compromising position.... promise..... however this did happen when she went to retrieve toilet paper rolls from Ann\u2019s house.... imagine this you drop your neighbors kid off at school and she is devastated because she forgot to bring toilet paper rolls needed for craft time (and as anybody knows who has had a child of elementary school age those are always a big must when it comes to craft time).... so you decide to do the (neice) thing and go back and retrieve those lovely toilet paper rolls from your neighbors house and then you walk in on your neighbor/friend Ann in an extremely compromising position and not with her husband.... soon enough everybody finds out what Ann is up to and the entire neighborhood goes sideways.... especially Charlie, Ann\u2019s husband.... i\u2019ll stop there with anything about the plot, I want you to read this for yourself and enjoy the journey... it is a fabulous one!This is a book about love, pain, family, friends, children, and everything else that makes up a life.... told very realistically with a huge dose of humor.... this book is going to make me look at my neighbors in a whole new way.... what is really going on behind that front door?

What goes on behind the doors of the families in your neighborhood? Behind the facade of the perfect marriage, the woman who is always meticulously groomed, the one who always seems to have it all together? In this neighborhood, filled with mixed couples, all with one child or more, there is apparently much going on behind the scenes. Ones secret is soon to be exposed, and in a very big, loud, public way. This revelation will cause the others to re-evaluate their own lives, their own marriages.I recently said I was tired of books with soap opera drama and unfeal, over srittencharacyers, women straight out of Desperate Housewives, but I had this to read. Already committed to read it and it was a sisters read so......... Sometimes it all in the tone, this was told in a light hearted manner, with much we humor. These characters were not cardboard characters but like real people,people you have in your neighborhood, can identify with them and their situations. In fact, there wasn't much in this book that I couldn't imagine happening, and much that I identified with. Mother overload, definitely, tired of meal planning or wondering whether one was feeding their family the right, nutritional food, check. Could go on and on, parts of one character, maybe parts of another.So as far as women's fiction goes this was a winner, also a wonderful change of pace that just might have changed my mind about reading books featuring a neighborhood or group of friends.

As it turns out, yes we do! Especially one as irreverent and wickedly funny as this one. The focus is on four families and told mainly from the point of view of Frances, the neighborhood\u2019s car pool mom. She\u2019s the woman you\u2019d want as your best friend. Nicknamed St. Frances, she\u2019s always ready to help anyone in need and puts everyone else\u2019s needs above her own.

One day St. Frances runs to a neighbor\u2019s house to retrieve a forgotten school supply for one of the car pool kids and finds her neighbor Anne in a compromising position. This revelation creates a ripple effect that affects everyone and leads them to look at their own relationships a little more closely. How well do we really know our neighbors, our children, and sometimes even our own spouse?Families and relationships are messy and I loved how irreverent, relatable, and real this was.

This book takes you deep into the lives of several family units in one neighborhood. Often sweet, generally funny, occasionally sad, but always interesting. If you're craving some domestic drama that will make you laugh and really think about relationships, this might be for you. For a lot of readers, they'll recognize themselves in some of the characters. As I'm childfree, it was actually a nice bit of escapism for me. It's just another day for Frances Bloom, stay at home mother and wife. She has plenty to do, and never seems to have time for it all. She is the \"carpool mom\", graciously taking some neighborhood children back and forth to and from school every day as well as her own. She doesn't mind it a bit, which may be part of the reason why some other mothers have given her the not-completely-complimentary nickname \"St. Frances\". Her usual routine is disrupted a bit when one of the children tells her she's forgotten some craft supplies at home. Of course, they are SO important. Always affable, she assures the kid she'll run back to her house and grab the ever so important toilet paper rolls and bring them back. She doesn't count on catching her neighbor Anne in flagrante... with a man's head between her legs. And that man is not her husband.Frances decides to keep the secret to herself (except for her husband, of course) but only a few days later, Anne's husband kicks her out. It isn't long before the whole neighborhood is talking, and the indiscretion of their friend causes other couples to have doubts about their own relationships and start examining them more closely, looking for faults. Anne's infidelity will affect more than her own family. I really enjoying getting to know each character. There are four families to keep track of, and a handy list at the beginning of the book so you don't get lost. I honestly thought I'd be more confused than I was. I only ended up going back to the list two times. For the most part, even the kids have their own personalities and are easily distinguished. This is an enjoyable read full of juicy drama that will make you laugh. I received an advanced copy of this book from Elisha at Berkley Publishing Group, thank you!

Her character is so witty, snarky and quirky that I couldn\u2019t help myself from laughing out loud many times while reading.

I had Abbi Waxman\u2019s \nOther People\u2019s Houses\n on my list of \u201cARCs past publication date that I need to get to\u201d and since I knew this author to be a humorous writer, I decided to move this book up the list. It turns out I made the right choice, as this was a fun read, one that was filled with snarky humor and realistic characters who dealt with everyday issues that most of us could relate to. The central character in the story is Frances Bloom, a middle-aged mother of three who enjoys helping others despite the overload of responsibilities she already has on her plate with running her own household as well as being the carpool mom for her neighbors\u2019 kids. After Frances accidentally walks in on Anne Porter \u2013 the mother of two of the kids she carpools to school \u2013 having an affair with a man that wasn\u2019t Anne\u2019s husband, she finds herself reluctantly pulled into the fray when, a couple days later, the secret is revealed in the worst way possible. Meanwhile, the other carpool families also have secrets of their own that they are more than willing to push to the back burner for the time being while they navigate the trials and tribulations of family life and raising kids. Anne\u2019s affair ends up impacting all these families in ways they never imagined and eventually causes them to re-examine their own lives and marriages.While I did enjoy this book quite a bit overall and found the characters easy to relate to, I was not able to connect a whole lot to the story on a personal level as I initially thought I would, probably because I\u2019ve read too many books with similar setup recently (families with kids all living in the same neighborhood dealing with every day issues of school, running the household, etc. whose lives are suddenly upended when an unexpected event occurs). In fact, this particular story reminded me of Sally Hepworth\u2019s \nThe Family Next Door\n, except that this one was much lighter in tone and way more humorous, not to mention much more irreverent with its fair share of swearing and various sex-related references. With that said though, I actually enjoyed these characters far more and felt that the interactions between the couples in this one were more realistically portrayed and in line with what many of us would see in our neighborhoods. The couple I actually enjoyed reading about most were Frances and Michael, as the hilarious way they would often banter back and forth while they tried to navigate the joys and frustrations of life with 3 kids reminded me of couples I know in real life.Overall, this was an entertaining read and one that I felt was much needed during this particular \u201cdown\u201d phase that I\u2019ve been going through. Though there were some serious issues that did get brought up in the story, those were dealt with appropriately without being heavy-handed and the light tone was maintained throughout, which is credit to the author Abbi Waxman\u2019s story-telling skill. This one is definitely recommended, though with the caveat that this might not appeal to all audiences due to the abundance of \u201ccolorful language\u201d (which, in my opinion, was more than expected but certainly not excessive).Received ARC from Berkley via Edelweiss"}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7538243-nikki", "userReview": "Four utterly hilarious stars!

This novel is a delight: witty, laugh-out-loud funny, insightful and even a little painful at times. Have you ever wondered what goes on behind closed doors? How well do we really know other people: our neighbors, our friends, even our own spouses and children? Frances Bloom is the carpool mom for the seven kids from four families in her suburban L.A. neighborhood. One day she walks into her neighbor's house unannounced to pick up a forgotten school project and discovers her friend Anne in a compromising situation. What happens next? Can something this big be kept secret? And if not, what will it mean for this family and ultimately all the families in the neighborhood, as each examines their own relationships? Waxman gives the reader much to think about as she delves into these four marriages. Can one be unfaithful sexually but still love a partner and want to stay in a marriage? Do one's responsibilities always come before personal happiness? Can trust ever be rebuilt once it has been destroyed? And when it comes to one's children, especially teenagers, how much privacy should they be afforded in their search for self? Some pretty weighty topics but the author handles these and others with compassion, insightfulness and a lot of humor.

Although in one case the door was not so closed!Abbie Waxman has written what at times is a hysterical and slightly irreverent tale of a neighborhood where everyone seems to know each other's business. Frances Bloom is quite the witness to the comings and goings of her neighborhood. She is the local car pool driver who takes neighborhood kids to school. She is also the one who inadvertently catches her neighbor, Anne, \"enjoying the attentions\" of a man on her living room floor. Unfortunately for Frances, that man is not her neighbor's husband but a younger man, Richard. This starts off a whole chain of events as the story seems to make the rounds of the neighborhood and Anne becomes fodder for the gossips and people at the local school and community events. As the story progresses, we hear of the other neighbors as their trials and issues go along with Anne's problems and as Anne's husband learns of her infidelity, the neighbors walk a fine line between acceptance of what has happened as well as navigating all the other things families often deal with. Will this marriage be saved? Will Anne and her husband split leaving the children bereft and ever so sad? This is the stuff of true happenstance and makes one realize that bad choices not only effect the perpetrator but those a person would least want to hurt.Thank you to Abbi Waxman, Berkley Publishing, and Edelweiss for providing this reader with an advanced copy of this novel.

She voluntarily carpools their seven children to school each day, ranging in age from 4-to 14-years old, and often helps in other ways. They all seem to have lives that are working well from outward appearances but that notion gets destroyed when Frances walks into Anne Porter\u2019s home and finds her in the throes of passion on the floor with someone other than her husband Charlie. The repercussions of that affair strips away the doors and walls of each of these families, exposing their truths and realities. While there are multiple points of view presented, Frances is the dominant and serves as the filter for those that follow. Her insights are raw, outrageously funny and authentic. She\u2019s a reflection of the modern parent who is sincerely working to have meaningful relationships with her children and spouse, making decisions in the moment as to what to let go and what has to be managed. Anne\u2019s betrayal shatters some of that idealism that earned her the nickname (behind her back) of Saint Frances. This is an extremely messy story that\u2019s well written, with humor, irony and heartbreak deftly dispersed throughout the story. The other characters, though having secondary voices, are richly developed and nuanced. I was hooked from the beginning and there is nothing predictable at all.

Although this story is centred mainly around one event within the neighbourhood's main cast of characters, it truly examines the backgrounds and relationships for each of the characters. Even though I personally am not in that period of time in my life, I can definitely see how the characters could be extremely relatable based on the circumstances that each of them are going through. That is another aspect of this novel, which is potentially terrifying--it's realistic. Everything that happens within this novel, the personalities and relationships, are incredibly realistic compared to real life because everything the characters encounter do happen in reality. I didn't find this a quick read to get through but it was an interesting one. To me, it felt like a combination of contemporary mixed with literary fiction. It really exposed the backgrounds of individual's lives and what could be happening within your neighbourhood (without your knowledge). For those who like realistic and relatable reads, especially involving a social circle such as a neighbourhood, I would recommend this. ***Thank you to Penguin Random House Canada for sending me a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review***"}, {"userName": "BookLover", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12285159-booklover", "userReview": "ARC requested through Netgalley, and kindly provided by Berkley Publishing Group in exchange for an honest review.I quite enjoyed this visit into the homes and lives of Frances Bloom and her neighbours. For some reason (and don\u2019t ask me why) I pictured comedian Miranda Hart as Frances and that made me love her character all the more.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d said Frances, walking by and farting silently as she went. She was opposed to chemical warfare on principle, but sometimes you just had to go with what you had at hand.\u201d\nOther People\u2019s Houses started off with Frances accidentally walking in on her neighbour, Anne, in a very compromising position. From there, I settled in and got to know the neighbours that featured prominently in the story - France and her husband and kids, Frances\u2019 cousin and her partner and child, Anne and her husband and kids and finally the mysterious Bill and his \u201cmissing\u201d wife and child.Frances, ever the people pleaser, felt the need to meddle in everyone\u2019s lives and was quite good at it. Out of all the characters, I think I connected with her the most. I really got a sense of what made her tick.Each of the stories was well rounded and enjoyable, when paired with Frances diving in and out and around as she worked through ever changing life with her family. There was one scene in particular that cracked me up. Without giving away any spoilers, I will just say that I couldn\u2019t believe the chaos that happened as a result of an innocent battle that Frances\u2019s husband chose not to fight with their young child. Pure comedy genius!\n\u201cBut I want to be a toilet.\u201dMilo was waiting to get out of the car. \u201cDad, just let her be a toilet, what does it matter? She\u2019s not applying for toilet college, is she?\u201dMichael saw the wisdom of this. Frances was good at this, letting the small stuff slide over her, he would be like Frances. \u201cOK, whatever.

This was the first book I read by Abbi Waxman and I may never have found her without the publisher asking for my opinions on the book. This book was just what I needed. I found it to be well written and lightly humorous. Often times, I find when books try to be humorous, they try too hard and end up just missing the mark and being slightly obnoxious. This one found just the right measure of humor and I found myself giggling at silly banter. On the other hand, the book also touches upon serious issues, such as infidelity, illness, and losing oneself in marriage and family. These issues were brought up in such a casual and realistic manner that they never felt forced or manufactured. I never felt that the author was adding something just to play with my emotions. An interesting aspect, in my opinion, was the way that the person who was \"good\" or \"right\" in a relationship can also be the person who is wrong at times. There was no one person that was ultimately just evil or too perfect. They were all human. With that said, I do think there were two scenes in the book that may have been over the top. One I passed off as a person being quite drunk and emotional. The other I passed off as a high stress situation. However, they both pushed the boundaries of becoming unrealistic. Fortunately, the rest of the book was good enough that I was able to overlook those two minor issues and still really enjoy the story. I am so glad that I found this author. I will definitely look forward to trying more of her work in the future.On a side note: There was one chapter that was so funny that I made my husband read it, as he was able to relate. If you happen to be strolling through a bookstore or library and only have a few minutes. You need to read chapter 36. (In my ARC it is chapter 36. It starts out: \"Soccer that weekend was particularly irritating.\") It is only a few pages long and you don't need to worry about knowing who the characters are or what's going on in the story. You'll know when the scene ends and it won't spoil anything big. If you are a parent, it is too funny to pass up."}, {"userName": "Libby Chester", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3815302-libby-chester", "userReview": "I love the cover on \u2018Other People\u2019s Houses\u2019 by Abbi Waxman. It\u2019s a picture of a dollhouse with the roof floating up so you can see inside. Extremely appropriate for that\u2019s exactly what happens inside the pages of this book. The roof is blown off the top of one of the neighbor\u2019s houses, and a woman that everyone thought they knew, surprises her neighbors. Frances is the slightly overweight, soccer, and carpool mom that everyone has come to depend on. Mother to three, Ava, 14, Milo, 10, and Lally, 4, the romance in her marriage has staggered off, oh, somewhere. Frances is too busy to be worried about it. Michael and Frances get along just fine, don\u2019t they? Well, Frances has always thought so, at least until she catches her neighbor Anne Porter in the throes of an adulterous fling with a younger man. The ramifications of Anne\u2019s infidelity are like throwing a rock (perhaps boulder) into a still pond. There were deep, underlying issues hidden safely under the still water, but now, things are bubbling up, and the neighborhood is reeling. And why is it, when people are in pain, there are always the rubberneckers, the gawkers, and the gossipers? Waxman shows all this. Waxman really hits the nail on the head as far everyday mom. She captures competitive and bitchy moms really well too. I enjoyed her writing style very much! Frances, as everyday mom maintains control of her world by helping others. Some of her friends call her Saint Frances, but she uses the F word way too much to be a saint. Sorry Frances.Other characters in the story are fleshed out delightfully. There are same sex couple Irene and Sara, with their son, Wyatt. Irene wants to have another baby, but doesn\u2019t know if her wife, Sara, who is also a pretty famous actress, is ready. There is Bill with his son Lucas, who communicates everyday with his mom by skype. And there are the Porters. Charlie, is a successful lawyer, and Anne is trying to find herself. Along the way, are their children Theo and Katie to become casualties?Waxman even manages to make \u2018the other man\u2019 a sympathetic character. Her unique writing voice invites the reader to sit down, have a cup of tea, and get to know these people. They will tell you something about yourself that you may or may not have wanted to know. This book is 4 stars for me. The ending is only partially satisfying. I wanted to know more about Anne and Charlie Porter at the end, especially how did Anne feel about some of the treatment she received from her friends. While there are depths that Waxman reaches and she does not shy away from serious issues, there is still a layer of reveal that for me, Waxman does not quite manage."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7948278-elaine", "userReview": "I was grateful to receive an ARC of \nOther People's Houses\n from the publisher.I enjoyed the author's debut novel The Garden of Small Beginnings so I had decent hopes for her sophomore effort.Once again, I was duped by my own optimism. ** Beware! Spoilers Ahead ** \nOther People's Houses\n is a rambling tale that focuses on several families in an comfortable, suburban LA neighborhood. We have Frances Bloom, carpool mom extraordinare; Anne, the ice queen and mother to two; Frances's cousin Iris, mother of one son and married to actress, Sarah. Readers are treated to each women's POVs, including a few of the husbands' to offer insight into their families from a male perspective. When Anne is thrown out of the house for adultering, the disruption causes a ripple effect among the families in the neighborhood and leads to typical gossip-mongering and a Desperate Housewives kind of vibe.I hated this story and I'll tell you why.1. First, I disliked all the female characters, especially Frances and Anne. Anne is a capable woman, mother and wife, but most women are because we all know men really don't do anything. Frances also has a potty mouth.Look, I enjoy an Quentin Tarantino movie as much as the next woman, but constantly cussing and spewing the F word does not prove that you are tough or a feminist. It just makes you sound vulgar. Its unnecessary, does not move the plot forward nor does it make me sympathetic to any of the characters.2. Anne is a twit. I don't care that she's adultering because it happens. The literary device pops up in almost every domestic book I read now. What bothers me is that Anne uses mental illness as a reason for cheating on her husband. Damn, that's a low blow for those individuals who suffer from mental illness. Not only is that incredibly offensive but extremely insensitive. I almost stopped reading when Anne offers that excuse to her cuckolded husband, Charlie.I can see it all now: When a wife is caught cheating, she'll just say, \"Oh, hey, honey, this isn't what it looks like. This guy means nothing to me. I just need his peen because I'm depressed. I'm sure you understand.\"Or when a husband is busted in the act, he'll say, \"Honey, it's not you, it's me. I need this vajajay because it makes me less sad. You understand, right?\"What's up with the popularity of using mental illness to excuse despicable or incorrigible behavior? This insanity needs to stop.Having a mental illness is not a literary device. It's a serious disease that impacts not only the sufferer but those around him or her. It doesn't excuse terrible acts. It doesn't mean you don't take ownership of your actions and the harm you caused other people. It is a cheap trick and I hate it.3. There's nothing original about this story; its about marriage, its about women doing all the work and making sacrifices to run the household and child rearing while men do the basics and get vaunted for it.4. In the immortal words of Salt & Pepa: Let's talk about sex, baby, let's talk about you and me...There is a quite a lot of sex talk and I'm not sure why. I'm no prude; I love to read hot, sexy, well written erotica any day but I'm not sure what the author is trying to say.That once you get married, sex goes out the window? So I've heard from friends who are parents.That people cheat because they're not getting enough sex at home? Uh...no, people cheat for a myriad of personal, emotional and psychological reasons and sex really isn't at the top of the list.So, what's with all the gratuitous, unnecessary sex talk about this penis and this vagina and how they meet in the middle? How does this add to this already otherwise terrible story?5. The men are generally forgettable, one-dimensional, poorly written characters.Anne's lover suddenly declares his love for her when she breaks it off and can't keep crying whenever his character shows up.I'm serious. This 27-year old art teacher can't stop crying for Anne, whom we know nothing about nor could I understand why he's in lurrvvee with her. There's no context, no understanding and no sympathy for any of them. He is nothing but a whiny, emotional, crybaby who can't stop crying! Jeez, even I wanted to punch him in the face and tell him to grow a set!Charlie, Anne's soon-to-be-ex, gets drunk at a birthday party and spews vitriolic hate at his wife when she shows up and as he is venting, he also discloses secrets about the other women attending the party. Way to go, Chuckles! 6. The adults in this cast of characters are immature, bratty and whiny. The sad thing is that the children seem to be the most mature and understanding of their parents' faults and foibles.7. There was nothing poignant or insightful about this book. It just read like adults behaving badly so what can you do? It was neither funny or amusing, a dark comedy or even satirical.And the ending was predictably chick lit.If you want to read a story with no real story and irritating, boring characters who swear like sailors for no reason at all, then read \nOther People's Houses.\nBut don't say I didn't warn you."}, {"userName": "Mlpmom (Book Reviewer)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3829694-mlpmom-book-reviewer", "userReview": "3.5 to 4 StarsThe Garden of Small Beginnings was in my top ten list of great books for 2017 which is why I jumped at the chance to read Waxman's sophomore novel and after reading the description, I knew I was going to have a great time doing so.Which, is why this review is a bit hard to write. I loved her debut so much and because of it I think I went into this with really high expectations, like, really high.I did like this and I'm normally not a prude when it comes to language in books but I have to say, all the harsh language in this, really put me off for some reason. It was just...unnecessary.I get using swear words when you are trying to prove a point or make a statement but using them as nouns, verbs, and adjectives as well? No thank you. It just isn't needed.Having said all that though, when you get pass all that, this really was a story that I think will resonate with a lot of people. Entering the lives of this neighborhood, this community was a little like getting the inner monologue of a reality TV show but not as cheesy but definitely heavy on the secrets, lies, and drama with maybe a touch of humor and family life that a lot of people will be able to relate too.After all, you never truly know your neighbors and sometimes you even don't know those you call family. This really was a heartfelt story about what everyone goes through. The doubts, the insecurities, the mystery that is love and life and raising kids and everything else in between. And while I didn't love it like I was hoping I would, it was still a really great story. *ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "Book of the Month", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46126209-book-of-the-month", "userReview": "Why I Love Itby BOTM Ambassador Skye ShermanI\u2019m not sure how Abbi Waxman manages to spin the day-to-day routines of rearing toddlers and teenagers in the suburbs into a story that I (a kid-free millenial) couldn\u2019t put down, but she did it. Somewhere between the crises of the carpool routine and the heart wrenching secrets, this book sucked me in until I cared about nothing more than the private lives playing out behind the closed doors of one unremarkable Los Angeles neighborhood.An honest and cheeky treatise on friendship, parenthood, and what it really means to grow old together, Other People\u2019s Houses tells the story of four families tied together by a common street address.

Do you ever think about what goes on behind closed doors on your street? Well, let me tell you, OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES will make you think about it if you haven't before! What a laugh out loud story it is! It's domestic drama at its finest and a story that will stay with the reader for a very long time. Frances is the car pool mom. She drives seven kids from four different houses to school each day. One day she drives back to her neighbor Anne's house to pick up toilet paper rolls that Kate left behind for a school project. When she walks in, she finds Anne on the floor, uh, busy, with a man, who isn't her husband! OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES is a very realistic story that is filled with the ups and downs of family as well as the good the bad and the ugly of relationships. France's is there for everyone, available when ever they need her and earns the nickname Saint Frances from the snarky soccer moms. Her conversations with herself had me laughing out loud to the point where I was having a hard time breathing. I love when an author can do that to me and it's been a long time since its happened. All of the characters are very real, not perfect but with lots of flaws and secrets. Oh, the secrets!! Hang on tight people, this is one crazy and hysterical roller coaster ride. I'm still trying to get a grip on my emotions.OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES is the first time I have read a book by Abbi Waxman but it won't be the last. She knows how to pull the reader in with her snark and humor and never lets them go. It's not all laugh out loud moments though. Abbi Waxman also weaves in the seriousness of relationships and how all actions have consequences. I know what you are thinking, do we really need to read about another neighborhood focused on family drama? Yes, yes we do! By the end of the story, you will feel as if you have known these characters for your whole life and you will truly care for them and will be cheering for all of them! They will feel as if they are your best friends. OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES is my favorite book of 2018 so far!
