I'd like a grant for a study researching both people who write in library books and people who engage in loud, long cellphone conversations in otherwise quiet and enclosed spaces (e.g., the bus from the Port Authority to Kingston, NY; the train from Penn Station to Philadelphia). My theory is that there's a great deal of correlation between these two behaviors, and studying the subjects who engage in them would add to the body of scientific knowledge that could be used in the future to develop a program wherein perpetrators of these acts could be grouped together and transported to an out-of-the-way location; because honestly, I really don't believe in capital punishment, but even my lefty views must admit that some citizens infringe upon the rights of the rest of us in completely unacceptable ways. Therefore, I propose mandatory relocation of library-book-writers and obnoxious-cell-phone-users to a distant and underpopulated island.A cold and ugly island, though, not a beautiful one like Dominica, where The Autobiography of My Mother is set. Though as Jamaica Kincaid makes clear, life on a Caribbean island isn't just always a Jimmy Buffettesque lark in the sand.I liked this book, though I'm sure not everyone would, and I managed to enjoy it despite the infuriatingly stupid underlining and marginalia of a previous NYPL patron. It's the story of a girl whose mother died giving birth to her; this motherlessness defines the main character's identity and life, which the story chronicles. Much of the novel is about colonialism, and it is very brutal and intense, with a great deal of human cruelty, sex, and masturbation. I thought it was good. It really took me into the existence of someone I couldn't relate to at all, in a way that was both interesting and satisfying, and it made me think about colonialism and power in a new way. What more do we want?One of the things I liked a lot about this book was that it did a lot of \"telling\" instead of \"showing.\" When I took fiction-writing class in college, the standard go-to criticism of pretty much anything I or anyone else wrote was, \"You do too much telling; you need to do more showing!\" This seems to be the infallible rule of writing workshops, that \"telling\" is about the worst sin one can commit and \"showing\" is just an absolutely great thing to do, but honestly, I've never accepted this dogma at all. What the hell is wrong with some good old telling? I like being told things sometimes. Seriously! Who decided this was such a horrible thing to do? I like telling, and I like to be told, provided it's done right. In this book, the narrator tells you all sorts of things, and it's great. It's what makes the novel work. I am sure that if Jamaica Kincaid had shared the draft of this book with a gaggle of undergraduates, they all would have been on her ass about all the telling and would have explained that she needed to show more. To which I say: screw them! All those fiction workshop kids might take a deep breath and settle down, lest I decide to expand criteria for my island.Anyway, this book wasn't flawless or amazing, but I did enjoy it. I felt no driving passion to get through the story and wouldn't have been upset if someone had taken it away from me halfway though, but I did like reading it and don't feel that time was wasted at all."}, {"userName": "Claire McAlpine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528841-claire-mcalpine", "userReview": "Let me say from the outset, I absolutely loved this book, its language, its voice, its poetry, the complexity of its narrator, who could be so distant yet simultaneously get so under your skin. There is a raw but brutal honesty to it, that disturbs and is to be admired at the same time, it is so full of contrasts and so compelling and beats its rhythm so loud, I almost can't describe it.In the autobiography of my mother, we encounter Xuela Claudette Richardson, who narrates her life looking back over seventy years, though the sense of her life reads as if it is being lived in the present, so vivid are the memories, so visceral the experiences. Her mother died in child birth and her father left with her with his laundry woman until she was seven, when he remarried and came back for her.She recalls the moment vividly through the senses and how it made her feel.\"I thanked Eunice for taking care of me. I did not mean it, I could not mean it, I did not know how to mean it, but I would mean it now. I did not say goodbye; in the world that I lived in then and the world that I live in now goodbyes do not exist, it is a small world. All my belongings were in a muslin knapsack and he placed them in a bag that was on the donkey he had been riding. He placed me on the donkey and sat behind me. And this was how we looked as my back was turned on the small house in which I spent the first seven years of my life...\"Through the narrator looking back over years and at events that she re-experiences as she recalls them, we see how it was then, that something, whether it is the lack of maternal love or the makeup of this character, nature or nurture, contributes to her way of being in the world in an emotionally detached way. She responds to instincts and observes acutely her own responses and is able to look back on them and describe and account for them, but there is a sense of something missing, that appears through the recurring dream of a mother climbing up and away from her and the questions she asks herself throughout her life.Her father's wife who is resentful toward Xuela and reminds her often that she can't be her father's daughter, soon bears two children, a boy and a girl. Though there is no love between them, Xuela doesn't hate her, she has sympathy for her.\"Her tragedy was greater than mine; her mother did not love her, but her mother was alive, and every day she saw her mother and every day her mother let her know she was not loved. My mother was dead.\"At 15, her father removes her from his home and takes her to live with a business partner and his wife as a boarder. She develops a close friendship with the wife, Madame LaBatte, observing with the same acuity their relationship and way of living and enters womanhood herself, observing and experiencing changes in her own body and the effect it elicits in others.She makes decisions about her own womanhood, about her body, about mothering. And she lives her life in accordance with those decisions. She marries, she discovers love and seems never to lose that ability to see through the illusions that surround all those things without sacrificing pleasure and contentedness.And at the end I ask, who is writing this story? Who is this mother who had no mother and no children? And in the dying pages, she will answer the question and we may realise we knew it all along.the autobiography of my Mother plumbs the depths of maternal love and its lack, mother daughter relationships, self-love, absent fathers and the latent influences of enslavement and occupation, how they continue to distort reality even when they are no longer present.I find it almost impossible to describe the reading experience, except that it left me asking \"How did I not know about this book?\" The voice is so unique and powerful and much more than an imagination, it is rooted in something strong and yet transparent and is utterly compelling. Don't read this for story, this is about writing and thus reading through the senses, Jamaica Kincaid creates prose that inhabits them all.Read my complete review here at Word by Word."}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "A somewhat longer and more complex work than the other book I just read by Kincaid, 'Annie John.' Similarly, though, it deals with fraught and complex emotional relationships. Or lack of relationships. The narrator here is a woman, Xuela, whose mother died in childbirth; and who lets that lack define who she is as as person.Her father is a distant and venal man, and Xuela doesn't think much of him. By necessity, she is essentially on her own. However, as the book progresses, she seeks something(?) in others: the narrator has an affair with a much older man, marries a white man who cares deeply for her but whom she does not love, and falls in love with a married man to whom she is only one of many women.Xuela strives to find an identity and a place for herself in the world, but through all her striving is a dark fatalism which undercuts her: what she describes as a 'bleak, black wind' at her back. This can be read as stemming from her family situation, her community, her gender, and the legacy of colonialism - but it's also simply and matter-of-factly portrayed as just the way this character is, without apologies or excuses.Is this actually Kincaid's reconstruction of her mother's life, or is the title a reference to the looming absence of the narrator's mother? I'm not sure."}, {"userName": "Simona", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6222130-simona", "userReview": "Leggere questo libro \u00e8 come sfogliare l'album dei ricordi di Xuela e della sua famiglia, o meglio di ci\u00f2 che resta della sua famiglia.

I could not have known at the beginning of my life that this would be so; I only came to know this in the middle of my life, just at the time when I was no longer young and realized that I had less of some of the things I used to have in abundance and more of some of the things I had scarcely had at all. And this realization of loss and gain made me look backward and forward: at my beginning was this woman whose face I had never seen, but at my end was nothing, no one between me and the black room of the world. I came to feel that for my whole life I had been standing on a precipice, that my loss had made me vulnerable, hard, and helpless; on knowing this I became overwhelmed with sadness and shame and pity for myself.So opens The Autobiography of My Mother, a fierce, complex discourse on love and lack of love in the context of colonialism. Although this paragraph sets up many of the themes that will be developed in the course of the book, it is not to be accepted as definitive. For one thing, this is the first and only time the narrator, Xuela Claudette Richardson, will represent herself as helpless or vulnerable. It's true, there's little if anything she can do to change the circumstances of her life; but she takes complete control of the way she lives in those circumstances. And she only rarely expresses pity for herself.I'll admit, it took me a while to warm up to this book. Xuela's voice makes no attempt to conciliate the reader. Also, many of the statements she makes clash with each other; at first these contradictions irritated me \u2013 was the author being careless? Just throwing poetic phrases together? For just one example of many, she writes \"I could say [my husband] loved me if I needed to hear I was loved, but I will never say it.\" \u2013 but she did say so a couple pages earlier. However, I came to realize that these were deliberate choices of the author. Most often, Xuela will both speak of herself or others as not loving or incapable of love, and also speak of them loving or being in love. This destabilization throws into question, for one thing, what she even means by \"love\". It is not safe to assume that this is obvious, even in context.One thing Xuela never expresses is uncertainty \u2013 even when she contradicts herself, she makes her statements with a tone of absolute authority. She is determined to control her own voice, at the end of her life as she is telling her story, just as the course of her life has been ruled by her self-possession, her fiercely independent determination to be sufficient to herself and please herself, and no-one else. This has sometimes led her to ruthlessness. She is capable of feeling sympathy for others, occasionally, but will not allow herself to do so in any way that might make her vulnerable. Consider the following paragraph (which also demonstrates the author's control of style):My life was beyond empty. I had never had a mother, I had just recently refused to become one, and I knew than that this refusal would be complete. I would never become a mother, but that would not be the same as never bearing children. I would bear children, but I would never be a mother to them. I would bear them in abundance; they would emerge from my head, from my armpits, from between my legs; I would bear children, they would hang from me like fruit from a vine, but I would destroy them with the carelessness of a god. I would bear children in the morning, I would bathe them at noon in a water that came from myself, and I would eat them at night, swallowing them whole, all at once. They would live and then they would not live. In their day of life, I would walk them to the edge of a precipice. I would not push them over; I would not have to; the sweet voices of unusual pleasures would call to them from its bottom; they would not rest until they became one with these sounds. I would cover their bodies with diseases, embellish skins with thinly crusted sores, the sores sometimes oozing a thick pus for which they would thirst, a thirst that could never be quenched. I would condemn them to live in an empty space frozen in the same posture in which they had been born. I would throw them from a great height; every bone in their body would be broken and the bones would never be properly set, healing in the way they were broken, healing never at all. I would decorate them when they were only corpses and set each corpse in a polished wooden box, and place the polished wooden box in the earth and forget the part of the earth where I had buried the box. It is in this way that I did not become a mother; it is in this way that I bore my children.This paragraph expresses, for one thing, all the love and sympathy she could not or would not allow herself to feel. The fates of these imaginary children are those of her real-life half-siblings; and more figuratively, her husband, who \"became all the children I did not allow to be born\"; she spoke of wanting to push him into an abyss, but not in anger.The pain of the book arises from her circumstances, in Dominica, as one of the people she always calls \"the defeated\" \u2013 the Carib and African people. There would be a lot more to discuss about this, but I will leave it for now. She writes:I am of the vanquished, I am of the defeated. The past is a fixed point, the future is open-ended; for me the future must remain capable of casting a light on the past such that in my defeat lies the seed of my great victory, in my defeat lies the beginning of my great revenge. My impulse is to the good, my good is to serve myself. I am not a people, I am not a nation. I only wish from time to time to make my actions be the actions of a people, to make my actions be the actions of a nation."}, {"userName": "Pedro Casserly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33457409-pedro-casserly", "userReview": "Esta buena novela de Jamaica Kincaid tiene una extra\u00f1a complejidad.

Kincaid speaks to the complexities of identity on the rift between conquering and defeated people. Able to contain the sometimes contradictory parts of herself and her history, Xuela, the protagonist, reflects on the circumstances of a life shaped by race, class and gender. She is insightful and thoughtful, and while addressing her life in post-colonial (if it really is post) circumstances, she does not sound like a primer on the subject. Written in deceptively simple form, Kincaid's words flesh-out an existence sensual and lived-in and melodic.\"Romance is the refuge of the defeated; the defeated need songs to soothe themselves, they need a sweet tune to soothe themselves, for their whole being is a wound...\" p. 216"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27804-jennifer", "userReview": "The blurb on the front of the book from Michiko Kakutani uses the words \"incantatory...lyrical\" which is an excellent description of Kincaid's prose style.

Life story of a woman born as her mother dies. It\u2019s black writing, so it is fierce and natural in sensations and actions, but I felt quiet content, enjoying the way the words flowed through. It\u2019s also written by a Caribbean woman and converted Jew (talk about a minority in a minority). It is not something you can read only once. I will read it again. It\u2019s not a plot story (there\u2019s not even dialogue). It\u2019s story of conception of the world and the body you are in. I think we are in the narrator\u2019s memory from her old age, but she starts us from her birth. She ain't going anywhere. She moves around, but this isn't about a writer or a mother or a wife. It's just about her, and she just is. You all made it through pages of describing the sky, trees, dirt. The main character feels like she exists among her natural surroundings (whereas she knows she's out of place in things such as school, marriage, family). The way she describes her setting is amazing writing, painful and intense to the reader, but very impersonal to the narrator. She is a being of nature and that\u2019s how she wanted to live. Like the mountains, they are impersonal. Not like a nation, that is personal as are the names in its histories make you feel in a certain way. She was \u201ca girl who prepared her own food.\u201d She does things herself...makes food in childhood, works as she comes of age, does not ask. This also means no relationships that she holds in her heart. She is no one's daughter, and none are hers.For this reader, she rids the human world of meaning - you know things like justice, sin, and morality. They don\u2019t really exist but for human perception. I think Xuela (her) understood this from her fist sense of awareness, so she decided not to follow any meaning or course in life, but she watches and ponders all those around her who do. Her father, who does not love, working a official job and rising up, stealing and going to church; her caretaker, with many children she does not have pleasure in, morns a broken plate that tells her about paradise; her stepmother out to kill Xuela as a threat, and has a son she wishes to live through cause he is a boy and daughter she does not admit is alive cause she is a girl; her two main lovers with the anger of their past wives for sleeping with another and their own meanings they grab onto in life; and her mother whom she knows she doesn\u2019t know at all, but can only imagine. She has so many questions for all these people, she never asks them but to herself. Do you guys think all these lives would have been different had she asked the questions she thought? He reactions are very matter of fact and pure. They are not cruel or kind (though certainly are to another viewer who lives in morals), they just are. Her lusts, her thoughts, sadness, pleasure, anger, sights come out and she is honest with them. There\u2019s no force out, no repression inward. Nothing sentimental. No need to be a mother or a teacher or to do something with her life. I will eat, sleep, make love, and die. This is what I felt, this is what happened to me, this is what I don\u2019t know, this is what I realize. No one loves me, I don\u2019t love anyone, but I don\u2019t hate either, I have no point in hating. She kills a turtle in a horrible way when she feels displeasure for them hiding, she helps her sister abort a child because she\u2019s there.Something awesome in this book like in no other I\u2018ve ever read: her enjoyment of her body. You see her look at, smell, feel herself without shame. It\u2019s not vein. Only exploration and knowing of it\u2019s beauty. How many women have you met who actually do that? We all cover our smells, hide our blood. It goes deeper, unlike her stepmother and the other women in this book, Xuela is not afraid of herself. Quite the opposite. She loves herself. No one \u201cbeheld\u201d her living, so she did it to herself. But I wonder what she would have felt if she came to behold another. A child, a love, a stranger...There is also something that drops off so quickly in this book. Writing. She begins writing letters as a small child and knows that her expression on paper can perhaps not change, but set off the motion for change of her life's situation. At that point I thought this book was gonna be about writing. Yet she does not pursue it, and writing ceases in the story. Why do you think? Did she not need to express to anyone anymore throughout the story? Did she not need to change the situation? Maybe we can view the whole book as her writing, just expressing to herself, not trying to change anything (though perhaps setting some readers in motion). She knows how self conscience she is.Thoughts on motherhood. What do you think? She knew she did not want to be a mother, to belong to anyone or anyone belong to her, and who would want to bring another child into this world of meaningless meanings? Do you think she considered that with her children, or it was simply, I don\u2019t want to have a child, so I won\u2019t. Perhaps it was both. Oh, we so debate the existence of personhood. Even once children are born, we don\u2019t consider them people, but that as they grow up, they are becoming a person. How much more indefinable is it when we consider a fetus and woman\u2019s rights. But whatever she thought with pushing them into the \"abyss\", she seemed to feel the only certainty in anything was death, so it really was not a big deal, and yet it was. I almost feel she kills all those unborn children in love rather than carelessness. I think Kincaid wished her own mother had never had children."}, {"userName": "Sara Hulander", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76733111-sara-hulander", "userReview": "Jag t\u00e4nkte p\u00e5 den h\u00e4r boken varje minut som jag inte l\u00e4ste den. \u00c4r s\u00e5 ledsen \u00f6ver att den \u00e4r slut, vill bo i Kincaids spr\u00e5k."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5276322-debbie", "userReview": "First let me say that I struggled with what rating to give this book and how to approach a review in general. I feel conflicted. I don\u2019t know if I feel conflicted in regards to my view of this book or if the character and her confliction have affected me. This book was nothing like I imagined it would be from reading the synopsis on the back of the book. The assumption is that this is a book about a woman whose mother dies giving birth to her and this is a story of her search into who this absent mother was. I felt because both of my parents fly with the angels, I might relate to a story of this type. On one hand I was able to relate in a lot of ways but then on another completely different hand I don\u2019t know if it was the main character or the author herself, annoyed me. In essence this was a book about a woman who\u2019s mother did die while giving birth to her and her constant struggle to comprehend life and define her identity in the world considering this tragic beginning. The loss of a parent in general is hard but the loss of a mother to a girl/woman is devastation. I get that, completely. The author/main character has a very poetic and fluid way of expressing her feelings and telling the reader how she lives her life. Her mother never was present, her father pushes her away because he\u2019s got his own demons and her step family hates her for what she represents. This is a woman who feels she is not loved, has never been and believes she never will be. She yearns for love so badly and seems to look for it in all the wrong places. Although, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d deny this observation. She claims to love herself so much since no one else does. She can\u2019t keep her hands (or other\u2019s hands for that matter) off of herself. She\u2019s obsessed with it. It really seems a desperate depression tied into the absence of her mother and lack of parental love that she is missing. This distorted mentality manifesting itself into some physical need. She is a wounded woman living her life under the guise of self love. I actually found her very selfish, immature and in need of prayer and a good therapist. This book has a lot great prose and verse that I found quotable. It reminded me a lot of something\u2019s I\u2019ve read by Toni Morrison or Alice Walker; spiritual, poetic, sometimes lofty. Towards the middle of the book there was an appearance of a lot of what I assume is the author\u2019s idealism or belief system in a sprawling rambling full chapter, which I found myself scanning through. There was a lot of spiritualism that I personally didn\u2019t agree with and didn\u2019t enjoy. At times, the story seemed to jump around. We actually didn\u2019t find out the town or the main characters name until into the book a good way. All in all, I related on a certain level to the sense of loss and how it affects a life but this character went to a place that I can\u2019t comprehend with her emptiness. It was sad but not morbid. Repetitive is a good word. It was almost as if this talented author found a way to say through 227 pages of print, in various ways, \u201cMy mother died giving birth to me, my father is self possessed, I\u2019m hurting but I deny it, I\u2019m empty, my guard is up and I won\u2019t let anyone in.\u201d I do actually recommend it. I\u2019m a real life observer of characters and do believe that people could relate to one thing or another or maybe all of the characters in this book.

It is a very uncomfortable story. Other reviewers have given synopses, so I'll skip that part. The aspect of the book that I found most striking is the way Kincaid makes the personal-is-political trope so seamless. There are moments when, as a reader, I saw the shadow of colonialism out of the corner of my eye, as it were, while Xuela was describing some very intimate moment. When colonialism is the topic at hand, the cascading effect it has\u2014the way it erodes every part of life on the island down to the most intimate, like the color of a lover's pubic hair\u2014becomes apparent. Xuela, the character, is not easy to like. There is nothing soft or warm about her. We as readers don't have an impulse to protect her because, as her narration makes clear, she wouldn't accept protection from anybody. She also won't accept love. Indeed, if there's a theme in this book that is stronger than the impact of colonialism, it's the idea that love is something taught, and Xuela has never been taught. I was longing for my Psychoanalytic Criticism classmates as I read this because of the ripple effect Xuela's lack of an early love object has on her whole life. The writing is extraordinary. So many times, I wanted to pull out a specific sentence or paragraph for the application it has to contemporary life and share it on social media or buy a billboard or something. Kincaid is especially good at examining the psychological consequences of a Have-Not, like Xuela's father, becoming a Have. The acquisitiveness that westernization imparts is a unique evil, and Kincaid shows all the ways it destroys not only the people it infects but also everyone around them and the society they inhabit.In sum, this is not a \"fun\" book, but it's a worthwhile one. If you are interested in the study of loneliness, it's essential reading. Good lord, that sounds depressing, but it's true. It's a quick read, and you will feel enriched for having experienced it."}, {"userName": "Steph", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15898619-steph", "userReview": "When Meursault learns of his mother\u2019s death in Albert Camus\u2019 The Stranger, he is apathetic to say the least. It is this strange detachment from emotion Camus explores in his existential search of meaning and existence. Fifty-four years later Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s Xuela is also confronted with the loss of her mother and regards it with Mersault\u2019s similar apathetic detachment as she states:\u201cMy mother died at the moment I was born, and so for my whole life there was nothing standing between myself and eternity; at my back was always a bleak, black wind\u201dbut unlike Meursault, Xuela does not get to attend her mother\u2019s funeral as she is but a newborn when her mother dies. Much like Camus\u2019 interrogation of the existential question of existence, Kincaid explores the affects of a severed bond between mother and child in a theme that stretches far beyond Xuela\u2019s personal story. Mother\u2019s are always much more than the women who push us into the world and that is especially so in the works of Jamaica Kincaid. Like many of Kincaid\u2019s female protagonists the quest, the desire, the desperation for self-identification is so intimately and intricately intertwined with their mother that only a violent break from one can grant autonomy to the other. This break is delivered early on for Xuela, the daughter of a half Scot, half African father and a Carib mother, which leaves her stumbling through turbulent relationships with older women who could easily be mistaken as substitute mother figures for the young girl if only they were not beating her, attempting to kill her, or prostituting her to their husbands. And yet, in spite of all of this chaotic mistreatment, Xuela learns how to defend herself with a myriad of weapons, one of them being Kincaid\u2019s most famously given to her female protagonists\u2013self-love.Read more: https://readingfields.wordpress.com/2..."}, {"userName": "Libbyrosof", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1756895-libbyrosof", "userReview": "About a third of the way through this riveting, beautifully written book (what a stylist!)

Indeed, it were 228 pages of a diverse, intense and fascinating narrative, but weirdly enough, I have been here before. I felt like I was re-reading Jef Geeraerts' Black Venus novel, which deals with similar and yet dissimilar themes. I was about to give this book 3 stars, but then again: why would I enjoy a male perspective, but be weirded out by a comparable and yet totally different, female gaze? I will never be a major reader of psychological novels like these, but the coherent narrative of heavyweight themes and character force, moulded into a monologue the reader is sucked in by, makes me grant this novel 4 stars, because making sense of any writer is ever a fallacy, amongst so many others with which to treat this book."}, {"userName": "Shirley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44331339-shirley", "userReview": "i was typing this out to a friend on whatsapp and she said i should post this on goodreads, and she's right because i have a terrible memory, so here goes:thoughts on jamaica kincaid: i read lucy late last year and finished autobiography of my mother last week and i enjoyed lucy more but i'm questioning if that's just because it's more relatable (it's about a young woman emigrating to america). i found autobiography of my mother was quite unpleasant; there's a lot of uncomfortable sex stuff and the main character is somewhat passive and almost just observes the situation a lot of the time. but it feels like an \"important\" book, in that you could write a lot of theory (and i'm sure people have) about it's treatment of race and gender if you were to sit down and deconstruct it. but i just don't feel like doing it because i didn't \"enjoy\" it and i really want to move on with my life. i think that's shallow though; i don't believe in books having to be enjoyable and/or pleasant to be worthwhile; i can't be pure that way. maybe i'll come back to it in a few years? who knows(excuse all my run-on sentences, i clearly haven't spent any effort on this)"}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622282-holly", "userReview": "EXCELLENT.

Her prose is beautiful, spare, blunt, compact and to the point. Her writing cuts you to the heart. Of course I'm biased because I love Jamaica Kincaid. She is one of the best raconteurs ever! So engrossed am I in her storyline that even though I\u2019m eager for the next development I\u2019m saddened by the ever expanding vignettes because I know that the book will end and my foray with the characters will end.The title itself is intriguing since an autobiography by definition is an account written by him or herself since the mother in the story is deceased everything is seen through the eyes of the daughter, Xuela.This immediately sets the story on its head providing an inverse tale of a mother/daughter relationship without the mother being physically able to tell her story. This novel introspection of a woman haunted through a lifetime by her own guilt at perhaps killing her only opportunity to have experienced true love. Xuela continues to search for love always via the mother she never knew, the mother whom though she never directly comes out and says so, Xuela believes she killed just by being born.Xuela experiences a dichotomy of self. Surrounded by others, in the midst of a sea of humanity and even during intimate relations with various lovers she is disconnected from other humans in a way unfathomable for most of us. Basically unloved and unwanted by an indifferent father Xuela disassociates from every other man in her life. Xuela never developed the ability to experience love fully with soul as well as body, even with men who become her \u201clovers\u201d. Her lovers and the people she interacts with are like ghost figures, much like the mother she envisions in her dreams, never quite fully accessible to Xuela\u2019s heart.Ms. Kincaid explores the many levels of Xuela\u2019s dissonance with her fellow humans through the race and gender restrictions of the time period.||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||Ms. Kincaid\u2019s books deal with many mother/daughter issues. The Autobiography of My Mother is a narrative on the mother the daughter never knew and Annie John, the novel I\u2019m currently reading is a tale of the deteriorating relationship between a mother and daughter who know each other perhaps all too well."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4812658-katie", "userReview": "This novel is a how-to manual on diction. The language that Kincaid uses would make anyone stand in awe. Xuela, the main character, struggles with her identity because she lives on an island that has been colonized by the British. She has been told all of her life that she is not as important as the white people that are in charge of her country. Xuela herself is not easy to like. She is inappropriate, brutal, and refuses to love anyone but herself. This book is hard to get through. There is no character to connect to, the main character has no drive, and there is no true plot. Kincaid's use of language is what saves this book. She uses unimaginably beautiful language to describe horrible and ugly things. I would not recommend this book as a pleasure read.

Kincaid's voice is deceptively simple, repeating simple sentences throughout that grow in meaning as you read. The narrator is compelling if not always relatable. She does not love easily or when she is asked to. She does not feel rage either, she simply exists in her own truth. She accepts her fate but also resists it by becoming her own person with her own thoughts that are never given in response to another. The connections to the Caribbean state of being are overt without being over-simplified. To a student of post-colonial literature, I'm not sure what would be new here, but what is here fits perfectly within the lessons learned of the post-colonial. Reads as a mood or observation rather than plot but that is appropriate for the work.

She is and was the epitome of rhythm, storytelling, diction, and imagery. I enjoyed the pace and style that this book was written in and look up to Kincaid's ability to mesh description and feeling.As far as the story itself - I was left wanting more. Strongly addressing gender and race issues, the message of the story is one of defeat. Xuela, the main character, was never able to mentally transcend above the circumstances that life presented her. An overall tone of pity and selfishness, she remains bitter in this book's entirety and every situation constructs herself to be the victim. Maybe that is the beauty of it, but personally, I became frustrated with Xuela's inability to take initiative."}, {"userName": "Mmars", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2243098-mmars", "userReview": "I think I can safely say that I didn't get as much out of this as many of the goodreads reviewers did.

Not only is the prose exquisite (both gorgeous and so fluid that I had to force myself to slow down to savor it), but the politics are overt without ever interrupting the story. Xuela's national/ethnic/gender/class position is fraught, and that's inseparable from her life story.
