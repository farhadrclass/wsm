Kristin McMichael Kristin McMichael\u2019s The Wendigo Witchling is an incredible addition to The Skinwalkers' Witchling Series. The book takes place following book one, The Witchling Apprentice. Cassandra Booth is newly bond to Skinwalker, Nathaniel Bay.\u00a0 They discovered that the coven wants to drain her power at the upcoming ceremony. She goes on a road trip with her friend, Whitney to avoid the ceremony.\u00a0 Upon their return, she needs to make a choice to become a skinwalkers witch or a wendigo witch.\u00a0 This paranormal fantasy is suitable for young adults.\u00a0I loved The Wendigo Witchling. It was full of non-stop action from beginning to end.\u00a0 So many unexpected things took place that it kept me spellbound.\u00a0 I appreciated that references were made to the previous book and to some events that took place in the Day Human Trilogy.\u00a0 I\u2019m hoping that the comments the seer made on the girls\u2019 road trip means that there will be a couple spin off series for both Turner and Whitney.\u00a0I enjoyed learning more about Jared Colley\u2019s character in this novel.\u00a0 We found out a lot of interesting facts about Jared, Cassie, and Nate in this story.\u00a0 I also appreciated that we discovered more of the history of the Wendigo.\u00a0 The plot was clever and well developed.\u00a0 I love that Cassie is good at thinking while put on the spot and goes with her intuition.\u00a0 I love how the book ended, and I cannot wait for the third book to be releases to find out what happened next.\u00a0\u00a0Complimentary copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "J.A.

Right away you know that the adjustment that Cassie is making hasn\u2019t been easy- for her, or Nate. He actually likes having a mate, he likes having Cassie as his mate. She though is fighting it tooth and nail. When the opportunity comes for her to escape with Whitney to see a familiar face she jumps at it. Expecting Nate to be furious once she returns, she is taken aback when he tells her to stay gone. Cassie of course, does not listen and is soon taken captive by the Wendigo pack that has been living nearby. It is ran by a former member of the skinwalker pack that Cassie grew up around. Somethings are revealed that could be game changers.Cassie is mated to Nate. She chose this, she did this to them in the last book. She already made her choice. She may not have liked the circumstances that led to that but it is what it is. I was more upset with her in this book than in the last. Nate\u2019s only concern is protecting Cassie. Cassie\u2019s only concern is being able to make decisions. Yet she made them- she took the test that put her in the coven. She mated with Nate. She just doesn\u2019t like the consequences of her decisions. There were times I wanted to tell her to grow up. I couldn\u2019t but man did I want to. The Wendigo Witch flipped the switch with Jared. We were introduced to him in the first book, as part of the Wendigo pack. Apparently, there is a lot more to it than that. With Jared comes the love triangle. Normally, I am not opposed to love triangles like some readers. I am however opposed to this one. A mated bond is a mated bond. It is not supposed to allow another into it yet that is what happens here. From there I just got more annoyed with Cassie as I read on. Both of the guys genuinely care for Cassie. It was difficult to see them in a position where they may be the cause of pain for her.The story was good, I still plan to read the rest of the series. I just couldn\u2019t move past the newly designed love triangle enough to enjoy the book."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5023292-anna", "userReview": "***I received this book in exchange for an honest review from the author.***GREAT second book. I dove into this after finishing The Witchling Apprentice because I couldn't wait to read more about Cassie and Nate. After this book, I feel just as confused as Cassie, I just don't know who I like better anymore!I am really looking forward to the last book. I want more magic, skinwalkers, hunky scenes and good endings. All things I know B. Kristin McMichael is already good at, so the expectations are definitely positive.The second book definitely held it's own to the first and same as before, lots of surprises and good feelings.5 stars :)"}, {"userName": "Sherry", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5643370-sherry", "userReview": "I might have liked this book a little bit more than the first. I found the Wendigo's to be an interesting addition. Lots of action in this one. I liked the new characters that we meet. I really liked Jared. I think I liked him better than Nate. I enjoyed all of the new info we learned. This book is fairly action packed and didn't take me very long to read at all. I can't wait to find out how it ends."}, {"userName": "Ruby", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18588516-ruby", "userReview": "As I read your books starting with the blue eyed legend I couldn't put down my I pad but I had to in order for me to go to work I was so cought up in your books I couldn't wait till I finished work then I glued to my iPad just to read your books I really can't wait to read the next one as I hope to read it very soon"}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7489259-anna", "userReview": "Great storyOn the edge wondering what will happen next!

Turns out, she may not want to join the coven, but that\u2019s exactly what she did when she bonded herself to Nate. Rather than face the ordeal of joining the clan, Cassie finds it\u2019s time for a road trip with her best friend, Whitney. The road trip was to get away, maybe learn a bit more about night humans\u2014it wasn\u2019t to find a deep dark secret hidden in Whitney\u2019s past, one that may hit a little closer to home than Cassie wants to admit. With their road trip cut short, it is time to confront everyone about the lies that had been their lives, but Cassie soon finds out home isn\u2019t exactly how she left it. Where have all the witches gone? She\u2019s the only witch left in town when they return. Soon she is dragged into more than she bargained for and she has to make choices that will change everything. She\u2019s finally given a choice: does she want to be a skinwalkers witch or a wendigo witch? Too bad there are more secrets than answers. Without all the facts, can she really choose her life\u2019s direction? Time isn\u2019t on her side as she has to make a choice. Now she just hopes it\u2019s the right one.", "title": "The Wendigo Witchling\n      \n          (The Skinwalkers' Witchling #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30420514-the-wendigo-witchling", "average": 4.28, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1465477336l/30420514.jpg", "reviews": 9, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6889132.B_Kristin_McMichael", "name": "B.
