This book was a total binge read for me - I received it in the mail on Saturday, picked it up to read Sunday night at 7:30 and finished it by 1:30 on Monday afternoon. And then I proceeded to spend WAY too long online looking at any pictures I could find of Blackwell's Island (today Roosevelt Island) and the structures/people/interiors/EVERYTHING. I'm absolutely fascinated with medical history and NYC history, and this book is a great addition to the other titles I have read on these topics. It is very accessible and very character-driven, and gives equal page-time to the main structures on Blackwell's in the 1800s ~ the Lunatic Asylum, the Workhouse, the Almshouse, the Hospitals for the Poor, and the Penitentiary. While all of the history of this time period absolutely blows my mind (how DID anyone actually come of out it alive???), what hit me the hardest is how little some things have changed over the years. The book ends with a striking discussion involving Rikers Island, and instantly the reader is pulled out of history and into present day, asking, \"Why can't we do better?\". A must-read for fans of history and social policy nonfiction."}, {"userName": "Marilyn Katz", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49808658-marilyn-katz", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to win a copy of this book from Goodreads. This is an important book for several reasons. It tells the sad and very political story of what became Roosevelt Island in New York City and it tells, through some grim historical accounts, the mistreatment of this city's poor and mentally ill in the 19th century. How many misconceptions and poor treatment practices are in place today? Although this is not an upbeat and pleasant topic, it is an important one and this book should be read by much of the public who think prisons are the place for our mentally ill citizens."}, {"userName": "Sarah Furger", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3912384-sarah-furger", "userReview": "Solidly researched and well constructed history of Blackwell\u2019s Island.

In the 1800\u2019s, Blackwell\u2019s Island, now Roosevelt Island in New York\u2019s East River, was home to a lunatic asylum, prisons, hospitals, poor houses and work houses. All built with the greatest of intentions, but all ending as abominations. From over-crowding, physical abuses, and utter disregard for sanitary practices, these buildings meant to protect, rehabilitate, and heal were actually death traps and torture chambers.  Horn focuses on a few major and minor players for a well-rounded look into lives that were so tragically affected, and a few who tried in vain to change the system."}, {"userName": "Kim McGee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5057126-kim-mcgee", "userReview": "Blackwell Island within sight of Manhattan was the dumping ground for New York's poor, diseased, mentally ill and criminals. It was a place where many traveled to and few came back unscathed and housed men, women and children. Over the near century it existed it was a place of abuse, cruelty, torture and unbelievable neglect. Not all the people working there were bad but the majority of them did very little to really help anyone there. The one person who fought for the inhabitants of the island was one of Blackwell's directors, Reverend French but in the face of overwhelming corruption and an \"out of sight, out of mind\" attitude from politicians, even he was not able to solve all of the problems there. Horn gives us snapshots of some of the more famous trials and a glimpse into the horrors of life there as well as the sensational story of Nellie Bly, who had herself committed to the island to get the real story of what the conditions were like. Interesting read for anyone who enjoys social reform and history of New York in the 19th century. My thanks to the publisher for the advance copy."}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616058-annie", "userReview": "It\u2019s an old saw that the measure of a society is how they treat it\u2019s poorest members. If this is true, then nineteenth century New York has a lot to answer for. As we learn in Stacy Horn\u2019s Damnation Island: Poor, Sick, Mad, and Criminal in 19th-Century New York, being poor and/or suffering from a mental illness and/or being a criminal at this time and place meant a trip to Blackwell\u2019s Island. The island was home to an insane asylum, a prison, and a work house from the second half of the nineteenth century into the early decades of the twentieth.

A lot I had to skim through but I was most taken by the story published by Nellie Bly having faked her madness to stay in the lunatic asylum where half the inhabitants were only in there by virtue of their not speaking English or having someone put them there.

Didn't realize until later that she also authored \nThe Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad\n, another history/true crime book that I previously read.Though the topics are different between the two books, I think The Restless Sleep is a more engaging read because Horn incorporates herself into the book by interviewing related parties, whereas Damnation Island edges towards a scholarly retelling told through various third-person and first-person written records. That's understandable since many of the related parties for Blackwell lived over two hundred years ago, but there weren't any descendants that she could interview? Maybe she thought that side of the research detracted too much from the main topic. Or maybe Horn came up with dead ends? Both books are wonderfully informative and detailed.As much as I want to believe that many of the book's inhumane practices towards women, children, the poor, mentally ill, or the physically disabled are dated means of confinement, well... they unfortunately aren't gone completely. And prison overcrowding and excessive fees to the poor remains an issue in the U.S. that many people are unwilling to address or even acknowledge. But getting a glimpse of the potential origins for the prison system and mental health foundations was a fascinating if sobering experience. Improvements have been introduced in some ways since then, some ways not. I thank Horn for shining a spotlight on this issue.Besides the stories of the horrible treatment, Horn goes into the blatant corruption that took place to keep people incarcerated for often trivial reasons. Especially for women and foreigners. It was too easy to get them committed to Blackwell for being \"insane\", it's scary. There are many names and dates to keep track of throughout the book, so it might be difficult to grasp the initial significance of certain events. Once I got past the fifty page mark, I didn't have too many problems keeping up with Horn's story.Don't expect a sunny read. But there are moments of gentleness and compassion that keep it from being a dire and gloomy one. Not everything at Blackwell was terrible, even if it initially comes across that way. They carried me over to the end.I enjoyed learning something new, and the events recorded within it will stay with me. Give Damnation Island a shot if you are curious about a darker side of reality that remains to this day. Maybe it might encourage you to become more compassionate.I received the book for free through Goodreads Giveaways."}], "description": "Today it is known as Roosevelt Island. In 1828, when New York City purchased this narrow, two-mile-long island in the East River, it was called Blackwell\u2019s Island. There, over the next hundred years, the city would send its insane, indigent, sick, and criminal. Told through the gripping voices of Blackwell\u2019s inhabitants, as well as the period\u2019s city officials, reformers, and journalists (including the famous Nellie Bly), Stacy Horn has crafted a compelling and chilling narrative. \u00a0Damnation Island recreates what daily life was like on the island, what politics shaped it, and what constituted charity and therapy in the nineteenth century. Throughout the book, we return to the extraordinary Blackwell\u2019s missionary Reverend French, champion of the forgotten, as he ministers to these inmates, battles the bureaucratic mazes of the Corrections Department and a corrupt City Hall, testifies at salacious trials, and in his diary wonders about man\u2019s inhumanity to man. \u00a0 For history fans, and for anyone interested in the ways we care for the least fortunate among us, Damnation Island is an eye-opening look at a closed and secretive world. With a tale that is exceedingly relevant today, Horn shows us how far we\u2019ve come\u2014and how much work still remains.", "title": "Damnation Island: Poor, Sick, Mad, & Criminal in 19th-Century New York", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35489149-damnation-island", "average": 3.67, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1505608318l/35489149.jpg", "reviews": 29, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4035.Stacy_Horn", "name": "Stacy Horn"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Historical", "New York", "Crime"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35489149-damnation-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4863441-unbelievable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27766.The_Restless_Sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17086094-imperfect-harmony", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5952.Waiting_for_My_Cats_to_Die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38816.Cyberville", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
