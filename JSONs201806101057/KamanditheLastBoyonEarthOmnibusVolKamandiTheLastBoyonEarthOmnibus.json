My understanding is Kirby started this book up with the idea of dumping it on other creators so he could concentrate on the New Gods. Well that never happened and the book is a pretty good adventure for such a throw away origin. It's basically a play on \"Planet of the Apes\" except with more races of animals being evolved and Kamandi being the last \"boy\" (more of a young adult/late teen the way this plays out) discovering how crap the world is. The setting allows Kirby to go pretty far out with his ideas. the only real problem is that in the twenty issues reprinted in this volume, Kamandi is basically kidnap bait constantly in need of rescue. Which makes him not necessary the easiest character to get behind, especially when their is a scientist dog that is much more interesting. Art wise, this seems extra rushed compared to most of his DC work at this time, but he can still knock you out with a panel.So ultimately it's good, but not great stuff from the King."}, {"userName": "Richard Guion", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3982222-richard-guion", "userReview": "I never read these comics growing up, but they are weird and wacky fun to read now in this beautiful hardcover collection. Kamandi is the last boy on Earth, which has suffered from a great apocalyptic disaster. Kamandi emerges from a hidden bunker, fully versed in human history and language, but totally unaware of the world outside. Which is dominated by all kinds of intelligent animals: Tigers, Lions, Leopards, you name it. Humans are around but they have devolved into savages with limited speech. Any Planet of the Apes fan would get a kick out of this. The first 15 issues are wildly imaginative, with Kirby throwing out fantastic concepts and settings."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119733-ryan", "userReview": "It's a shame the writing is not on par with the visuals. I should have loved this because it's just so weird. But the stories are as boring as the ideas are creative? That doesn't even make sense does it? I mean, with this many strange ideas, there should be some more interesting stories and characters. I liked it more when Kirby did this with Devil Dinosaur."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/864541-mike", "userReview": "This omnibus volume collects the first half of the 1970's comic Kamandi,\" written and drawn by Jack Kirby. The series diverges from Kirby's usual superhero fare, set instead in a post-apocalyptic world gone mad. The many similarities to the \"Planet of the Apes\" movies are clearly and intentionally set up as we see a ruined Statue of Liberty in the two-page splash of the first issue. The exact nature of the planet wrecking Great Disaster is not revealed, but it is explicitly referred to as a natural disaster, rather than the more usual nuclear war. The series is framed as a coming of age tale. The teenaged Kamandi and his grandfather are the last two residents of underground bunker complex which has housed a community of survivors for generations (the exact time span is unclear, but appears to have been at least several hundred years). The complex has a library with information about the pre-disaster world, but conditions aboveground are unknown. While Kamandi is out scouting, looters break into the bunker and murder his grandfather. When Kamandi confronts the murderers, they are revealed as not men, but intelligent, bipedal wolves. Orphaned and alone, Kamandi strikes out across the remains of the United States. He encounters mutant humans, and a whole host of speaking, technology-using animal life forms: A tiger society based on Rome, a Gorilla city, the \"United States of Lions.\" As a comic artist, Jack Kirby is one of the best. His action scenes have an exuberant vitality second to none. However, as a comic writer, many of his stories and conceits are illogical and implausible. Kamandi suffers from a good deal of this. A lot of what happens in this book seems to be based not on good storytelling, but on what Jack Kirby felt like drawing. The speaking animals feel like an attempt to take \"Planet of the Apes\" and turn it up to eleven. The explanation of how Ben Boxer transforms is completely ludicrous- A heart that acts like a nuclear cyclotron? What does that even mean? To be fair, there is a story near the end of this compilation explaining how the animals gained intelligence and the use of language. I consider it the best chapter of the book, tying together a human researcher from before the Great Disaster and his post-Disaster Gorilla counterpart. At the time of the disaster, a great deal of an experimental drug was spilled into the Washington DC water table. This mutagenic substance multiplied the mental abilities of animals far beyond normal levels. The resultant hyperintelligent animals were the ancestors of the creatures encountered by Kamandi. How or why they became bipedal and took over human technology while humans became feral and barbaric is not explained, however. Sadly, plot holes are part and parcel of this series.Despite my problems with the writing, I enjoyed the artwork. Kamandi also serves as an interesting prelude to the TV series Thundarr the Barbarian, a later Kirby project. I don't doubt his enthusiasm for the project, but the quality of the story and setting is uneven. Not superb, but worth looking at if you are a fan of Jack Kirby."}, {"userName": "Peter Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36270534-peter-kelly", "userReview": "Right, right, so the obvious thing to think you first learn about Kamandi The Last Boy On Earth is that it\u2019s a cheap knock-off of the Planet of the Apes, right? Well technically you\u2019d be right, but in a more profound sense, you\u2019d be wrong.I mean, yes, Kamandi lives on a post-apocalyptic Earth where animals, including gorillas, have assumed supremacy over nature and mankind has been reduced to vermin. And I\u2019ll admit that that is the Statue of Liberty on the cover.But those details fade into atoms of triviality when considered in the context of the book\u2019s authorship. Kamandi was created by Jack Kirby, that genius who with only pen and ink invented such luminaries as Captain America, the Fantastic Four, and that old monster Darkseid himself!! He\u2019s really creative, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.And that creativity oozes through each page of Kamandi. Our protagonist is befriended by Ben Boxer, a descendant of humanity\u2019s greatest minds who wears an ancient space suit to contain the radioactivity spewed forth by his body. When he presses the nuclear reactor in his chest he becomes an invincible, and gains a resemblance to the Silver Surfer. Later, Kamandi encounters bipedal lions who work as rangers in a nature reserve, humanity being the endangered species in question. The finale of this volume involves a malevolent dwarf using his psychic powers to unleash an omnicidal germ to an unsuspecting planet!!All of which would make a very good movie. DC should probably focus on making cinematic adaptions of this franchise instead of Superman.If you like the story lines in your stories unhinged and your comic art beautiful, check out Kamandi!!"}, {"userName": "Evan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256809-evan", "userReview": "At once wildly imaginative and creatively bankrupt. Narratively boring from issue to issue. There are characters, but no characterization to speak of. Kamandi's Prince Valiant-style balls-to-the-wall punch-based problem-solving is nearly fun, but any character Kirby writes is annoying and boring, Kamandi most of all. Kirby's art is better than his writing, but it's still hardly excellent. The poor dynamics of his action scenes mean that characters are forced to constantly explain what is going on (\"I'm falling through the floor!\"). The art suffers from Kirby's trademark samey posework, plus aesthetics that make for better posters and covers than interior art.Still, I love it. It's imaginative and schlocky and harmless. It's a hot mess with pedigree."}, {"userName": "Rick", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/874192-rick", "userReview": "One of my favorite comics from my childhood, Kamandi still holds up as wonderul escapist fiction. I revisit the dystopian class reversal world of Kamandi every couple of years and am always delighted at it's blend of action, adventure, mystery and excitement. While Kamandi does not always sit well with all comic book fans, or even fans of Jack Kirby, it should delight anyone who craves adventure, has a strong suspension of disbelief and is young at heart. If you are a fan of either the original Jonny Quest or Planet of the Apes, you should check out Kamandi - and if, like me, you are a fan of both - you will love Kamandi."}, {"userName": "Zack!

Jack seems to be having a really good time drawing all the animals and bizarre creatures. This seems like the perfect title for a guy like Kirby to just go nuts on. I think Kirby was at his best during the 70's, and this book is just more evidence of that.The one drawback of the book, and it's a big one, is the repetitive nature of the stories. Each issue can be boiled down to the same plot over and over. It did make it difficult at times to read, but when I think back on it, I think I'll remember all the fun stuff going on, and not the repetition."}, {"userName": "Matthew Brady", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2227722-matthew-brady", "userReview": "I finally finished reading this thing, and man, it was pretty awesome. It's less philosophical than some Jack Kirby comics, but there are still some interesting ideas about man vs. nature and the ways we've affected the world. Lots of great action, freaky creatures, and wild sci-fi ideas too; you never know what's going to happen next, and it's pretty awesome to see Kirby let his imagination loose. Now I need to try to obtain the second and final volume, and then read stuff like The Demon, Devil Dinosaur, and his 70s run on Captain America..."}, {"userName": "Craig", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/649244-craig", "userReview": "I liked it, though not as much as I might have if I'd read these when I was 9 or 10 years old. It's all just a bit too wacky. If these stories had a bit of a harder edge to them, I'd like them a lot more (something like Marvel's Killraven/War of the Worlds, perhaps). As it is, it's fun to read, but I can't read more than an issue or two without growing a bit weary of the over-the-top Kirby art and story. Still, it's a beautiful collection and gives these comics the kind of respect they're due."}, {"userName": "Alger", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272561-alger", "userReview": "This is something I have wanted to read forever, and it did not disappoint.
