And one I wasn't expecting.I requested this on impulse on NetGalley based on the cover because music is like catnip in books for me. If I'd read the synopsis I'd probably have hesitated. Which is such a shame as I raced through this book and I absolutely loved it.I was expecting something light, and probably fluffy, with a musical backdrop.What I read was something far darker than I could have imagined, where the music came to life on the pages. And I could not stop reading. It's almost like there's a beat behind the story itself. Music is everywhere for Mira, it's part of her very character, and it was everywhere in this book. I could almost hear it.I was absolutely blown away by the story. The pace was steadily rising, with various small story-lines all weaving together into one hell of an ending. And the story was more complex than I had prepared myself for, with more strands and deeper meaning. And trigger warnings for substance abuse and grief most definitely apply. As heavy as the story is at times, any issues are handled sensitively (even if I wanted to cry at times) and I felt it was done in a very responsible and non-preachy way.This is not a light, fluffy, summer read. But it is excellent and you should absolutely read it."}, {"userName": "Olivia (The Candid Cover)", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14451126-olivia-the-candid-cover", "userReview": "Music is a topic that I always seem to enjoy in books, so I was not surprised that I enjoyed When the Beat Drops by Anna Hecker so much.

That had no impact on my thoughts. My thoughts are my own.Maaaaan that was a good story. I wasn't sure what to expect when I first requested When the Beat Drops. I just knew that it sounded like it could be good, but I wasn't sure. I'm not sure why I was a little bit skeptical about the book in the first place. But it proved me wrong! When the Beat Drops was about a girl who started off wanting to play the trumpet for this college or camp program thing but then she gets to tag along with her sister to this party and bumps into a DJ when her sister ditches her and slowly develops an interest for DJing in the story. The DJ aspect of the story was just COOL! There was a bit of a party scene, and drugs, and sex involved in the story but they didn't take up the entire story. It's easy to overlook, especially how the character handled all of the situations she was in. (There was a time when she was being silly, but there was character growth from that!)I just really liked the DJing part of the story very much. It was just super cool. This story was like P.S. I like you by Jenny Han with a bit of a party scene/ mixed in with it. It is more of a young adult/new adult crossover book so I'd recommend this to older high school students and above in the young adult crowd. I'd say there should be a warning for drugs, sex, and a character death but it's not terrible. It was very well written.I definitely would recommend this to anybody who can appreciate the music/DJing part. Again, this book was so cool. I wasn't able to find much of anything I didn't like about this book. It's a five star read for the unique plot, character development and it's fast pacing. I was able to finish this in about a day if you don't count the 8 hours of sleep and work in between.

The lead character, Mina was relatable and interesting. Although, I didn't like that she easily and quickly brushed off her best friends for the new music scene. However, on the other hand, I could see where she was coming from as all of the people she encountered were different from her friends. Mina really did shine when she was DJing. She had an \"old\" soul trapped in a young body. The way that she was in tune with the music as if the vibrations and beats were flowing through her veins. Her newest friend and female DJ, Shay was cool. Shay showed that being a female DJ is exciting. There needs to be more female DJs. Yet, this book is not just about music but the dangers of drugs. Mina learns the hard effects of drugs. I like how author, Anna Hecker did not down play the ages of the characters or try to make them so mature that they were unbelievable. They were very relatable. Additionally, the story was upbeat and refreshing. When the Beat Drops needs to be in your reading pile.

The way it is advertised makes it seem like a light fast read about a girl who likes music... but it is so much more than that. When the Beat Drops is a heartfelt and heartbreaking story about finding yourself.What I Liked:I honestly loved Mira. Her whole world is music. She hears it in movement and emotion and nature. That's why it was so easy to believe that she picked up DJing so fast. She lives and breathes music. It was that fact that made this whole book so believable and enjoyable. All of the characters were actually pretty great. They all had so many dimensions to them. They had their own flawed and complicated lives. They also were all so unique and interesting.I also liked how this book handled some pretty serious topics, like drugs, death, mourning, denial, and family problems. It was able to tackle these topics in what felt like an honest way... making them simple enough to understand without making light of them.I also really loved how this book ended. I'm not gonna say too much about it (cause #nospoilers), but let's just say life isn't perfect and I love how this book showed it.What I didn't Like:There really wasn't much I didn't like about When the Beat Drops. I was a little lost in the beginning, just because I had no idea what I was going to get out of this book, but that feeling went away pretty quickly.I also didn't really love Yelena's character, but the more she was around the more I liked her. Also, I felt like Mira's introduction to the warehouse party scene was a bit abrupt and odd, but I got over that pretty quickly, and it didn't bother me that much.Overall:I was completely surprised by this book. It was so much better than I expected it to be, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a YA contemporary that feels a little more solid that some others. I am going to give When the Beat Drops 5 out of 5 hearts.*I received an eARC of this book from NetGalley.

I definitely have a bias against \u2018rave\u2019 music, but the description of the novel pulled me in. Reading what the book was about gave me a lot of \u201cSave the Last Dance\u201d vibes.Going through college I knew my fair share of people who would attend Electric Daisy Festival or Electric Zoo Festival or whatever festival was going on around us. They would talk about how great it was and all of the friends they would make and how much fun they would have, and I would be like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s not really my scene.\u201d And that\u2019s kind of how the protagonist of this novel, Mira, starts off feeling as well. She\u2019s a jazz trumpet player who basically believes that anything other than jazz music is for people who can't appreciate REAL music. Her sister Britt comes home from college and takes her to a warehouse party and first introduces her to electronic dance music, and after making friends with a lost DJ and stepping into her booth, Mira begins to understand the appeal of EDM.I thought this book had many good qualities. For starters, I have never read a book about the rave scene. I like that this is a YA book that teens who are interested in EDM and music festivals can read. I also liked how it takes the perspective of someone who thinks EDM is not \u201creal music\u201d and transforms their opinion, thus potentially opening more readers to the music genre. The way that the music is described is done very well. I was concerned that I would be bored during the DJing scenes as I can\u2019t actually hear any music, but the author does such a great job of transporting you there and keeping you hooked.This is also a book that contributes to the We Need Diverse Books campaign. Mira in the book explains that she is biracial with a black dad and a white mom. The author explains the frustration that inevitably comes when someone asks \u201cWhat are you, anyway?\u201d without making the whole book about being biracial. Part of creating diverse books is not necessarily making the entire novel about race; rather, it is about creating a world where all children can see themselves in a book. There is one particular chapter where Mira explains how people have guessed she\u2019s \u201cItalian, Mexican, Hawaiian, Brazilian, Israeli, and once even Gypsy\u201d and how she hates that people try to \u201ccategorize [her], put [her] in a neat box and stick a label on [her].\u201d She talks about her frustrations, which is something other biracial readers can relate to.Mira was also a very realistic teen who struggles with sibling rivalry, drama with friends, and first loves. She was not perfect and did make some questionable decisions, but what teen doesn\u2019t? Another thing that I liked about this novel is that it talks about drugs. Taking drugs is a huge part of the EDM culture, but not everyone does it. I thought that the author did a good job of explaining why people like to take drugs at festivals while also tackling the dangers of drugs. This is especially useful for teens who are starting to get into the festival scene. Mira is a character who is able to enjoy the music without ever indulging (aside from drinking too much champagne at one point), which shows that you can enjoy EDM music without taking Molly. Her sister, on the other hand, takes drugs quite frequently. Britt\u2019s dependence on drugs and her inability to enjoy the music without them consumes her and offers a good contrast to Mira\u2019s abstinence. The one area that caught me off guard, where I found myself questioning over and over again, was the parental involvement. Am I supposed to believe that a parent wouldn\u2019t notice one of their daughters completely changing due to events in her life? Granted, the parents seem bogged down by financial troubles, but there are some pretty drastic turns that make me question the realistic element of the parents of Mira and Britt. I would hope that parents would be more aware of such drastic changes in their own child(ren).Overall, I found this book to be an enjoyable and quick read. I thought it did a great job of tackling the drug culture of raves and would recommend it to any teens who either like EDM or are interested in attending festivals. It had a very typical YA plot arc, but nevertheless I found myself reading it in one sitting."}, {"userName": "Suze Lavender", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29148122-suze-lavender", "userReview": "Mira's parents run a gym and Mira's sister Britt is a star athlete.

Mira falls in love, her sister is involved in something she doesn't want to be a part of and it soon becomes clear that Mira is the only one who can keep a cool head in a crisis. Mira has to grow up quickly to adapt to all of the changes. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find out where her story would lead and read it in one sitting.Anna Hecker's gripping writing style makes When the Beat Drops a true joy to read.

I love the Mira as a character she was in depth and well written I felt like I was with her trying to figure out everything. Seeing how she not only handled her own dreams and situations but also that of her friends and family. I loved the dynamic she had with the music - not only one single genre but fitting in a range made it feel more diverse and as someone who doesn't really listen to either genre I had fun learning more about them through the eyes of someone close to my age. The writing was able to create a slow build up in suspense and anticipation, entangling all the smaller story lines into an amazing well planned and well detailed ending.This novel is great for anyone and everyone and I feel like it would be able to help a lot of people on how o handle various different situations that seem to becoming more and more common in this day and age.

Mira is an under appreciated teenage jazz nerd who is plunged into the world of DJing the summer before an important music school audition. Her eyes are opened to a new world that she must decide can or cannot fit into the one she already knows.Why only three stars? I should come right out and say that I am not the audience for this book. I do not read much YA. Scenes of lusty teenage infatuation tend to push me away. I knew that Mira\u2019s love interest was bad news the moment he arrived. This book walks the line of accepting or defending drug use in a way that made me, very much an abstainer in such substances, quite uncomfortable. Hecker\u2019s vivid descriptions of the warehouse dance clubs and festival scene had me flashing back to the times I spent unpleasantly long and loud hours selling posters to drugged up individuals in Chicago. Like Mira, I am also not much of a dancer either!Despite all these personal taste differences, When the Beat Drops is written and told so well that I could not put it down. Without the use of cheap cliffhangers or unlikely twists, this book has just the right amount of conflict to keep things interesting, even if, like me, one feels no special connection to any of the characters. Although the general trajectory of the story tended to match my predictions, there were still a few moments that took me by surprise. Were I a different person, I can imagine this being a really satisfying and meaningful read.All that said, there is one aspect to the central thesis of the book that I take issue with. In the jazz versus DJing problem as it was presented, jazz is this straight laced, buttoned up, dance-free recitation of pre-written music. Maybe that is the case for some contemporary high school jazz bands, but historically it could not be less true. People did and still do dance to jazz music. And arguably, jazz helped to popularize the notion of live improvisation that eventually lead to elements of hip hop and DJing. Hecker probably knows all this, but for some reason, her protagonist seems not to. On top of this, Mira\u2019s revelation to combine live jazz with electronic music, a plot development that I knew was inevitable after reading the jacket copy, feels like it arrives quite late in the narrative. It certainly made for a happy and exciting ending, but it might also have been interesting to see how different characters reacted to Mira\u2019s step forward.All in all, this is a solid book. Anna Hecker weaves an engaging plot and infuses her language with a rhythm that keeps the pages turning. I look forward to seeing what she does next!"}, {"userName": "Gmr", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2699650-gmr", "userReview": "Every time I say the title, it morphs in my head from simply words to an announcement, an anthem if you will, backed by DJ \"footwork\" and beats that vibrate in your chest. What I loved about this one was how the story married all types of music together, how the author took us behind the turntable into the hearts and souls of those who make or mix the music, and how much deeper the story ran than at first may be perceived. We've got sibling rivalry, artistic competition, family breakdown, those who've unknowingly lost their way, those just finding it, musical expression/appreciation, friendship lost and grown anew, first love/lust, drug use and repercussions of such...shall I continue? The elements of the story run as varied a circle as the notes that make up its virtual tracks, and are as colorful as the outfits sported by the attendees. Outside of the musical expressions and adventures, or perhaps it's better to say intertwined with it, is the story of two sisters finding their way after loss, anger, and the bitterness of the world has had its way. Each character introduced has something to share, to learn, or simply to endure, but it enriches the story that much more. In the end, it was a musically charged tale that I simply did NOT want to end, but end it did and really WOW...just WOW. It'll take you on a ride you weren't expecting, to places you never dreamed to visit, and leave you with a new appreciation for music, life, family, and friends. Along with the entertainment factor, you've got a great reminder to follow your dreams, wherever they may lead, and even though they may change along the way, that's okay...it's YOUR beat, your mix to make.**copy received for review"}, {"userName": "Teri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4989035-teri", "userReview": "As a music lover and former band geek, I was immediately drawn to this book.\u00a0 Mira's obsession with music, ambitious goals, and close relationship with her family make her instantly likable.\u00a0 Despite that close relationship, she feels as if her parents always put her sister's needs and interests ahead of her own, and she's very accommodating and understanding for her age.\u00a0 I admired her determination to work on her goals, try new experiences, and meet new people instead of sitting around sulking after missing music camp.\u00a0 The dynamics between Mira and her best friends are genuine and relatable, and getting an insider's view of DJing made this tech-lover very happy.The first 70% of this book was enjoyable read for me, but soon after, things seemed to go off the rails.\u00a0 I'll try to put this in general terms to avoid spoilers.\u00a0 I found it difficult to believe that parents would be oblivious to such a profound change in their child's appearance and actions.\u00a0 Mira and her family are dealing with, as well as avoiding, several problems, but the blame comes across as misplaced.\u00a0 By eliminating a certain aspect from their lives, everything is resolved, which is an unrealistic expectation.\u00a0 Questions are left unanswered, I was ultimately disappointed at certain choices that didn't ring true for the character, and the ending felt rushed.\u00a0 \u00a0My issues are personal, and I'd still recommend this book to music lovers, because it's rare to find books exploring that world - they're few and far between, and I'd love to see more.\u00a0Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the digital ARC."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Shanahan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7429809-jennifer-shanahan", "userReview": "This was a good one! I have read like 6 YA books in the last week and only a few stand out. Mira, the main character, is a high school student and confirmed band geek. She plays the trumpet and wants to attend a specialized music conservatory for college. Her two best friends go to music camp that she normally would have gone to, but her parents dont have the money this year and she finds out too late to get a scholarship, so she is stuck at home for the summer. Her sister, who is normally a straight A soccer star go-getter, comes back from college a changed person. She has a new attitude and new friends. Mira goes to a party with her sister, Britt, and discovers the world of DJ's parties and unfortunately drugs which her sister is using. Mira gets swept up in this new life (not the drugs) but starts DJ'ing herself and falls for Derek who she thinks is a manager/promoter. He makes all these promises to her and she totally thinks he is going to deliver and that hes a great guy. Some twists in the story change her mind pretty quickly and she sees how wrong she is and how wrong the lifestyle her sister has fallen into is. This book is all about family and love and looking out for each other when bad choices are made. Mira learns a lot about herself, her sister, her parents and her life and matures in a wonderful yet painful way as the story progresses. I really liked the writing, characters and the musical background of the story. Definitely worth reading!"}, {"userName": "Ms. Nguyen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5992001-ms-nguyen", "userReview": "Mira has always been second place to her soccer star sister, Britt. However, she has found her niche with her band friends.... until they go away to summer band camp, and Mira is left all alone. Britt invites her out one night to a warehouse party, complete with DJs, dancing, and.. molly. Mira gets a new boyfriend who is constantly on the party scene, learns to DJ, starts making new DJ friends, but she still has commitments to her trumpet and an upcoming audition that she's been preparing for her whole life. This book was not at all what I expected.. it was refreshing and new and different. I liked that the sole focus was not on Mira's relationship with her parents or just the boyfriend or just the music. The meshing of all of these things helped to make the book a pretty quick read. This is definitely for young adults, though. I can't imagine any adults who like YA being into this. There's not a ton of depth. It's just a fun read."}, {"userName": "Akeating2003", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34356592-akeating2003", "userReview": "I received an ARC from Netgalley. I thought this would be enjoyable since the main character is a misfit and loves music (hits close to home). I didn't expect it to be so intriguing that I just kept reading straight through. The music details about jazz and mixing sounds make me want to find this composition and listen to it. I have never been to any event like the ones described, but I can totally relate to being out with people and having the 'Simply Irresistible' urge to dance what a great song is played. One thing I wished it had was a little more exploration into the parents. I didn't fully get their characters. Then again, maybe that is because I rarely read YA and possibly relate more the parents......Overall great read and I highly recommend it!!!"}, {"userName": "Sjoera", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45276785-sjoera", "userReview": "I received an eARC from the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review.This book was way more than I expected! When Mira thinks her summer couldn't get any worse (not being in band camp with her friends Crow and Nicky), she reconnects with her sister Britt and attends her first warehouse party. She falls in love with DJ-ing, learning the ins and outs from new friend Shay, and with Derek.I liked Mira, a very relatable character, she is naive in some ways, but mature enough when it comes to making the right choices.I enjoyed the fast pace of this book, really hooking me in. The way Anna Hecker wrote about topics like grief and mourning, drug abuse and family/friendship/boyfriend issues made this book a real page turner!"}], "description": "Seventeen-year-old Mira has always danced to her own beat.
