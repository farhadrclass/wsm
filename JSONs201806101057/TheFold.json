The story moves along at a brisk pace. The mystery keeps unfolding in increasingly bizarre new layers. A team of scientists discovers a way to teleport matter between two rings \u2013 very much like Stargate, though early on we are warned not to make that comparison, because the scientists hate it. The only problem: The team is secretive about how the technology works, and why they insist on testing it for another year before publically announcing the breakthrough. Strange things begin to happen. People from the team start behaving in odd ways. At first, it\u2019s nothing big, but still . . . the powers that be ask Mike Erikson, a man with a perfect memory, to visit the facility and find out what the team is hiding before ruling on whether or not to extend funding. Things get weird (and dangerous) very quickly.This book is sort of the opposite of All The Light We Cannot See. Read The Fold for the plot, not the writing. The prose is workmanlike and gets the job done, but don\u2019t expect evocative descriptions or nuanced characterization. Sometimes the writing gets in the way, at least it did for me. For instance, the author uses the pacing mechanism \u201cA moment passed\u201d so often that it became unintentionally funny. I was reminded of the old Monty Python sketch: \u201cA moment passed. Another moment passed. Then, suddenly, another moment that seemed like the same moment but was actually a different moment . . . passed.\u201d Despite that nitpicking, the book is a real page-turner. If you want a good beach read that you can finish quickly and don\u2019t have to think about too much, this is great entertainment."}, {"userName": "\u2718\u2718 Sarah \u2718\u2718 (former Nefarious Breeder of Murderous Crustaceans)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298986-sarah-former-nefarious-breeder-of-murderous-crustaceans", "userReview": "[ (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "[toward the Lovecraftian (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "When DARPA scientists create a wormhole device in the California desert, why is New England schoolteacher Mike Erikson tapped to investigate the installation? Because Mike Erikson has an eidetic memory and is one of the smartest people on the planet! Can Mike find out what's really going on at the installation despite the secretive scientists?I got this from Netgalley.On paper, this book sounded right up my alley. What's not to like about Sherlock monkeying about with some kind of wormhole device? Still, I have a mountain of unread books lying around the Dan Cave. However, after having a few fellow reviewers gush over this, I had to take a closer look. Fortunately, it was still up on Netgalley and I was happy to take the plunge.The Albequerque Door, named after a Bugs Bunny episode, folds space to transport people and objects between two gates in an instant. Or does it? Mike feels a sense of wrongness when he arrives and things get wronger by the moment. I had a pretty good idea what was happening but it was still a delightful ride getting there.The ride started slow, like pretty much every time I have to ride somewhere with my parents these days. However, Mike Erikson was interesting enough to keep me hooked until the really crazy stuff started happening. I rarely say this about science fiction and fantasy books but I dearly hope this is the first book in a series starring Mike. He's that damned fascinating.Anyway, I loved the way things unFolded and the truth behind the door was very cool. When will scientists learn that squamous horrors lurk in pretty much every undiscovered reality? The ended was pretty damned sweet and while it wrapped things up, things were open-ended enough for a string of sequels.That's about all I have to say.

I\u2019m going to say that it doesn\u2019t matter because even having read 14 and knowing a little about where the Albuquerque Door would eventually take the story I didn\u2019t get how it worked until it was explained and if I\u2019d never read 14 I think I would have liked everything in this story just as much.If you are looking for a book with some fantastic wtf-ery in it look no further The Fold should fit the bill. If you have read anything by Peter Clines before then you know he has this great blend of humor, pop-culture and J.J. Abrams-ness, yes that is a thing, to him that make his stories this colleague akin to LOST + Fringe + Ready Player One + Legion + Scooby Doo with a smidge of Sliders and it totally works.The actual story of this is probably only a 4 star read BUT there are a few things that Peter Clines has done exceptionally well that I really loved in the story that give it an extra bonus 0.5 stars and the round up. The First is MIKE and his ants. Only Brandon Sanderson with Steven Leads in Legion has done such a great job of making the inner workings of a genius\u2019s mind so relatable and interesting. That is high praise from me as Sanderson is my favorite Fantasy author. Our main character Mike has an identic memory but that memory becomes almost another character in the story as the \u2018information black ants\u2019 bring up pieces of memory and the \u2018logic red ants\u2019 put that information to work to come up with answers. Seriously it was such a great addition to the story and made Mike one of the most likeable and relatable geniuses I\u2019ve read about.The Second is the Quantum Donuts. This book has some big ideas in it that I\u2019ve read other authors try to explain and it never goes well. Iit either gets too technical and boring and I\u2019m dosing off somewhere or I end up feeling like \u2018oh, this is one of those you\u2019ll just have to take my word for it that\u2019s how it works with no explaination and let\u2019s move on.\u2019 But Peter Cline is able to use normal everyday lingo and items to show his big ideas in an interesting way with just a piece of paper OR a box of donuts. \n\u2622 The Skinny \u2622\nReggie has a problem. He knows about one of the biggest discoveries/inventions of our time. In fact he has been funding it for years but something just isn\u2019t quite right with the project. He needs someone to figure out what and since he is friends with one of the smartest people in the world he is hoping his good friend Mike can help him out.\nYou know when you\u2019re in a rush and you put a T-shirt on backward? Even if there\u2019s no tag in it, you don\u2019t have to look in the mirror to know it\u2019s on wrong. You can just feel it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got for me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just wrong,\u201d he replied with a shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can tell you. There\u2019s something so wrong out there that you can almost feel it in the air. And you know what\u2019s the weirdest part?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI think everyone out there feels the same way.\u201d\nThe Scientist team doesn\u2019t exactly welcome Mike with open arms but they are willing to at least let him in a little bit and let him see the Albuquerque Door in action. It is AMAZING and Reggie is right one of the greatest inventions of our time but no one seems to be able to give him the answers he is looking for and maybe the team there is hiding something. The more time Mike spends there the more he gets the impression that things aren\u2019t as great as everyone keeps telling him. \n\u201dI was saying, at one point Foghorn and the chick are playing hide-and-seek. Foghorn hides in the woodbin. Egghead looks around for a few seconds, writes out a page of mathematics, and sticks a shovel in the ground about ten feet away. Out pops Foghorn. He tries to argue that what\u2019s just happened is impossible, and the chick keeps showing him the page of calculations.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s what you do?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what we do,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cWe take over six hundred pages of math and force-feed it to the universe through an electromagnetic funnel.

But I cannot deny that it's the only book this year that I couldn't put down until it was over. I had several books that I didn't want to put down but ended up putting down anyway. This one I read in one sitting. It consumed me. I was able to escape for the span of six hours. Then I see all my friends thought it was just \"all right\" or plain \"ridiculous\" and I started questioning my preferences, my place in life, where my heart was leading me...Just kidding. This book fucking rocks.Original review:Before I begin my review it should be known that I pretty much hate science fiction literature. I couldn't even finish Andy Weir's uber-popular novel, The Martian. I hadn't heard of Robert Heinlein until last year, and I cannot recall the last sci fi novel I actually finished. When it comes to movies, I don't like Star Trek, and if Star Wars didn't exist I wouldn't be upset. That being said, I love science fiction movies with a strong horror element. Event Horizon, The Thing, and Sphere are three of my favorite films.But this book? This book right here? This book is fucking awesome. I started Peter Clines's The Fold at 11pm last night. It is now 5:30am and I am finished. I've read mixed reviews, but I'm here to say that I found absolutely nothing wrong with it. The Fold is gargantuan fun from beginning to end. In fact this review is going to be all over the place because I don't have any complaints. I'm just going to tell you what I liked while trying not to spoil anything for you. Because you really should go into this book knowing nothing about it. Let the joy of discovery wash over you. Or, you know, whatever.The first thing I will mention is the attention to detail where character development is concerned. Mike, our MC, is a genius with an IQ of 180 and an eidetic memory. I've read about these types of people several times before but Clines delves into aspects of this character I never would have considered. How someone with a photographic memory deals with loss. What goes through their minds during sex. If other authors have tackled these ideas, I've not come across them. All I know is that Clines did it well. I shed a tear listening to Mike explain how everyone he's ever lost replays perpetually in his mind because it is literally impossible for him to forget.The insane happenings of this book was another huge plus for me. I had no idea what was coming next, and I sure as shit did not expect the second half of the book. It gets pretty fucking epic by the end. I certainly did not plan to read this in one sitting. But after the halfway mark it was impossible to put down. Finally, the science. I loved the way Clines explained the unexplainable without really explaining anything. If you read this, you'll understand. In the hands of a less-capable author, the how of the device would have come off as a cheat. Not here. It makes sense, and leaves just enough to the reader's imagination. In summation: The Fold is the perfect blend of action, what-if tech, and creature-feature. This book is definitely in the running for my favorite of 2015. All the fucking stars. Highest possible recommendation.Final Judgment: Don't'cha wish your sci fi was cool like me? DON'T'CHA?!"}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "The author's voice sounds like Dean Koontz and sticks pretty damn close to its SF roots until it turns into some delightfully wacky horror. I'm a creature of habit. I love horror, and anything that gives it to me is my friend. If it's ostensibly SF before it gives me all that horror, then I'm pink as a bloody peach.I'll get something out of the way, first. It feels like a hugely popular novel. I don't know if it is, or will be. I'm reading it because it's new SF and it's an author I've never touched before. Even if it is dumbed down a bit for an audience, at least it feels its roots. Mystery first, SF second, and then, after the first two acts are done, it transforms into Horror. I'm satisfied with the progression, but I do think it could have been a bit more complicated and long, building into a grand masterpiece of ideas far outstripping it's fundamental teleportation science roots, not that I didn't appreciate the well-crafted renewal of an old multiverse trope.Don't get me wrong. As SF I was thoroughly captured and loved the perfect timing and progression. It always kept my undivided attention. I enjoyed the screaming telegraphs of things to come, even if they were all hamfisted and obvious. There were, on the other hand, some points that truly surprised me and hit me in the gut with the implications and the effects. Practically all the big reveals were damn satisfying and had me repeating the words aloud. It was damn amusing.And that's what the whole novel was: It was Damn Amusing. The characters changed by way of broad strokes and implacable effects, and Mike was way too good to be true, but hell, at least he had a pretty down-to-earth rationale for keeping a wrap on his gifts. AND I'm so relieved that it wasn't yet another tortured genius trope. So, so. Clever tale, wonderful progression between genres that built up to big action, and likeable characters. I can't say this will ever be regarded as perfect literature for any genre, but its mixtures, clear prose, and clear characters gave us all a pretty damn slick and entertaining novel.You know, brain candy, with mysteries, cockroaches, interdimensional portals, and multi-limbed alpha-predator horrors coming to a popular Californian town near you! The literature equivalent of a blockbuster summer film. :)"}, {"userName": "Trudi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi", "userReview": "Three of my most favorite Stephen King sci-fi-esque stories include the novellas The Mist and The Langoliers and the not to be missed short story \"The Jaunt\" (which if you haven't read this delightful, chilling diddy yet GO DO IT NOW and thank me later). Seriously, it's awesome. The Fold in all of its pulpy goodness, thrums along with a vibration that's very Stephen King in its approach to sci-fi and I couldn't help but be reminded of those three stories while burning through its pages. It's fun, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and the plot doesn't get too bogged down or concern itself too much with the science. For sci-fi purists, Clines approach would probably come off as lazy here -- but for me, it was just right, just enough at all the right times.There comes a moment in the novel (you'll know when you get there) where I screamed and thought the story was heading in a very different (much desired) direction than where it eventually ends up. The horror fiend in me perpetually lusting after her next scare was okay with that though. There's still lots that will goose your adrenaline centers and get the heart racing. This is a sci-fi thriller, with the emphasis on thrill with some other \"stuff\" thrown in to blow your skirt up at the end. And I can't talk about that \"stuff\" because you know, that would make me a spoilering asshole. Let's leave all that fine spoilering to Uncle Stevie, shall we? He does it so well. I absolutely love and cannot recommend enough Clines other book 14 which in the telling and execution falls much more on the horror end of the spectrum. The two books read extremely well side by side however, and if you read one you will absolutely have to read the other to enjoy the tuning fork resonance that Clines has set up so very nicely. And how much did I love our main character Mike Erikson? He's the smartest guy you will ever meet with a crazy IQ score and a photographic memory -- he literally remembers everything he's ever seen or heard. Which sounds awesome when you're simply talking about replaying your favorite Marvel movie in your head while you fall asleep. Not so awesome when you have instant full sensory engaged memories of somebody's horrible death. This \"talent\" / \"curse\" should make Mike either a full-on arrogant asshole, a complete weirdo with no social skills or a combination of both, but he's neither. Mike is just a nice guy, a school teacher trying to live out his life with relative normalcy. His supporting cast are the jerk faces and arrogant assholes almost laughably so sometimes. But they do get better and more likable as the story hits the 3/4 mark. I did shake my head at how many times the phrase \"but that's impossible!\" was thrown about even as they stood around this spectacular fold in space-time dimension and all these crazy incidences keep piling up on top of one another. Rather than see it as a weakness in the story though, I actually found it added some much needed comic-relief. When things are at their craziest and someone is still shouting \"but that's impossible!\" you really have to laugh. At least I did. So final verdict -- a pulpy, extremely fun, page-turning sci-fi thriller that will make a most excellent addition to your summer reading."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9185509-melissa", "userReview": "The fold is another great science fiction/horror by Peter Clines. It is a stand alone novel but if you have read his previous novel \"14\" you will be pleasantly surprised by some merging stories and characters. Mike Erikson likes to think of himself as a normal guy... Your average high school teacher. However he has a special ability, a eidetic memory. He is able to remember everything he has ever seen or heard, replaying it exactly like it just happened. His old friend Reggie convinces him to come and work for him, assessing a top secret project. A group of scientists and computer experts have created a doorway that \"folds\" time and space. Those who walk through the doorway are teleported to a matching doorway somewhere else. However, the doorway isn't quite what it seems...I have read some reviews of this book who loved it up until the last third or so of the book, saying that it takes a strange turn and becomes unrecoverable. In some ways I tend to agree. However I suppose because I read 14 (which does the EXACT same thing) I was expecting the specific twists and turns. However I admit I preferred 14.I enjoyed all the characters in The Fold, however they are quite a similar bunch to the characters in 14. The male main character Mike in The Fold bared some striking similarities in personality to Nate in 14, and the same for the female leading character Jamie, who was very similar to Veek. Arthur was similar to Tim, and the other secondary characters also bared similarities to their counterparts in 14. This wouldn't be so bad, except for the fact that 14's characters and storyline were superior. The endings of both were extremely similar and I just wish there was a bit more. I loved the monsters and creatures in The Fold. They were a bit more detailed and gruesome than they were in 14 and I enjoyed that.The romance in The Fold was a bit of a let down. I think it was just too similar to 14 because the characters were so alike... It just didn't do it for me.Overall I enjoyed the story. The story itself I give 3.5 Stars..HoweverWhat jacked this review up to 4 Stars?? THE NARRATOR!!! Oh my GOSH Ray Porter is a FANTASTIC narrator!!! I am so amazed how good he is! Seriously, there is a reason why he won best narrator for 2015 in the audible awards! When you listen to him, its like you are listening to 12 different people. He is so amazingly talented! I want to go out now and get everything he has ever narrated and listen to it! I am going to miss his voice now I have listened to over 20 hours of him total!Would I recommend it?The story? Yes it was a good read, even if it takes you in places most people didn't want to go towards the end. However the audio version was FANTASTIC despite the story, and I would recommend listening to it to anyone!

I couldn\u2019t put it down, which is not something I normally write in reviews because it sounds so much like a clich\u00e9. In this case, however, it\u2019s absolutely true and no exaggeration. This book even caused a moment of blustering indignation at one point, because it was 4:30 in the morning but it still wasn\u2019t letting me close it up and get some sleep. And that is the story of how I finished this almost 400-page book in a little more than a day.Needless to say, I was already feeling beyond excited when I first learned that Peter Clines was going to have a new book out this summer. I\u2019m a big fan of the author and his genre-mashing stories and writing style, after having read his novel 14 and gobbling up every book in his Ex-Heroes series as they are released. So when The Fold finally landed in my grubby little hands, I could hardly wait to get started. What does it have in store for me, I wondered, if it wasn\u2019t another Ex novel about the zombie apocalypse versus superheroes?Well, my excitement only grew when I started reading and discovered that The Fold is actually kind of a \u201cside-quel\u201d to 14. And while the novel\u2019s protagonist Leland \u201cMike\u201d Erikson might not be a superhuman, with his powerful eidetic memory and the ability to perfectly recall anything he has ever heard or seen in his life, he may as well be. This part is really cool: Mike visually pictures all his memories as bits and pieces in his head, carried by a swarm of ants all constantly seething with information and interpretation. The ants allow him to take in the sights and sounds, and organizes them with his thoughts. He can put together graphs and statistics, even overlay them in 3D representation if he wants, all in a blink of an eye. Captain America or any movie that\u2019s ever been made can be instantly replayed in his head whenever it pleases him, as long as he\u2019s seen it before. Man, what I wouldn\u2019t give to have a gift like his.But then, there are the downsides. Mike can never forget anything, which includes bad memories. Traumatic experiences stay with him forever and with awful clarity, like they only happened five second ago. Between that and the overwhelming, all-consuming way his ants seethe and swarm when he lets them out to do their thing, I can understand why the guy just wanted to fade into obscurity and teach high school English in the-middle-of-nowhere, Maine. It\u2019s a safe place without any great challenges to tempt the ants. It\u2019s a place where he can just be normal.All that changes one day, when his best friend Reggie drops in on him with a job offer, one that he knew Mike could never refuse. Out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists have figured out a way to transport matter in a mode that is effectively as good as teleportation. By \u201cfolding\u201d across dimensions, their invention called the Albuquerque Door makes the difference between point A and point B almost negligible, so that the subject can simply travel across that distance with a single step. The Door works. And it\u2019s safe. Those are facts no one can dispute. However, the scientists are refusing to go public with it for some inexplicable reason. On top of that, Reggie can\u2019t shake the hunch that something about the project just feels wrong, so he sends Mike out there to scout things out and report back to him before the government approves funding for another year.What follows is riveting and unique genre-mashing experience, taken to a whole new level. After all, that is what Peter Clines does best. The Fold starts off reading like a Michael Crichton novel, with 100% more pop culture and geek references. Despite its nature as a sci-fi thriller-suspense mystery, the book is surprisingly easy to enjoy without the reader feeling inundated with heavy science and tech terms \u2013 an impressive feat, considering how so much of the premise deals with topics like quantum physics or cosmological theory. Information was doled out in unobtrusive ways which often meshed neatly with the plot, like during the course of a funding review, or in casual conversations between characters over drinks at a bar.Though the writing style isn\u2019t anything special, the smooth flow of the prose almost makes reading this book like watching a movie. Mike is like a modern Sherlock Holmes, gathering clues with his photographic memory to build a framework of evidence to bring back to Reggie and DARPA. There\u2019s always an air of suspense just hanging over your head, especially in the beginning when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, and the scientists\u2019 strange attitude towards Mike can\u2019t be explained away by simple hostility. Even when nothing much is happening in a scene you can still feel the increasing tension and expectancy, which makes it really hard to stop (in case you\u2019re wondering, this is how yours truly got in trouble and ended up being awake even five hours past her bedtime).There\u2019s a marked difference in the second half of the book, when the story take a turn for the creepy before arguably veering into horror territory. If you\u2019ve read 14, you\u2019ll have some idea of what I\u2019m talking about. It actually surprised me how pleased I was to see the green cockroaches in The Fold, as that was the first hint that the two books were connected. In fact, The Fold reads a lot like 14; the two books share more than just the same world, as they are also similar in tone, style, as well as structure (though ultimately I think Clines handles the themes and pacing much better here). And just like my review of 14, I can\u2019t really go into the second half of The Fold without giving too much away, though I will say everything reaches critical mass in a significant, explosive way.The Fold is hands down my favorite Peter Clines book to date. It\u2019s got everything \u2013 mystery and suspense, humor and horror, science fiction and the paranormal \u2013 all perfectly blended together with a bizarre twisty ending that will keep you saying, \u201cJust one more page\u2026\u201d A fun and enjoyable read all around."}, {"userName": "Zoeytron", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron", "userReview": "The opening chapter is pure thriller and engaged me immediately. Then we are introduced to Mike, a likeable high school teacher who just happens to be a genius. Not only is he brilliant, but he has a photographic memory. A good friend of his from college has been trying to poach Mike to go to work for him in a hush-hush government experiment, and finally succeeds in piquing Mike's interest enough to woo him away from teaching, and sets him up in a secret testing compound. Mike is given little information other than something seems slightly \"off\" with the science guys and techies there in the compound. Mike is to check things out, get a feel for what is going on, and confirm that the secret project is moving forward and worth another year of funding. Love the premise of the story, although it ended up careening off into something that didn't work as well for me as I would have thought. It got exceedingly busy there at the end. With the exception of Mike, the characters were pretty thin. I liked Mike, despite his fixation on smiles. It's mentioned. Alot. Fake smiles, genuine smiles, practiced smiles, weak smiles, tight smiles, the ghost of a smile. Egad! Enough with the various and sundry nuances of the upturned mouth. There is work to be done here! And so, my feelings about this novel are mixed enough to go with only three stars, a little sad for the fourth star that might have been."}, {"userName": "Armina", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5600230-armina", "userReview": "Buddy read with some awesome people at Buddies Books and Baubles\n4 STARS\nThis was pretty entertaining and fast paced. It never lost its momentum. And yet something faltered in the story towards the end and I was left feeling a bit dissatisfied. Can't quite put my finger on what and why. May be it was the way too many cool/creepy ideas were thrown into the mix in the last third of the book and almost none of them reached their full potential or were developed even a bit. There are a lot of clues this may not be the last we see from this world and Mike. I really hope we'll get more answers in future books/stories. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars although they are not very strong.Still, this is a solid sci-fi thriller with bits of horror and even a dash of romance. Highly recommended to sci-fi geeks with love for cool modern culture references. Full review may come at some point.June 3, 2015, Pre-reading thoughts:This is my first Clines although I have 14 on my TBR list.

I would say if you like Stephen King or Peter Straub, this is right in your wheelhouse. First of all, though, this is one of the most interesting main characters I've ever seen. It's not a spoiler to say this guy has an eidetic memory. Now sure, dozens (if not hundreds) of authors have used characters with photographic memories, but I've never seen the mechanism for remembering spelled out in such clear and fascinating terms. The main character's instant recall becomes a storyteller's device for building drama and suspense.

It merged the genres of mystery, horror, sci-fi, and fantasy very well. The whole story had the feel of an episode of The Twilight Zone, which was pretty cool. Mike Erikson is living the quiet life as a high school English teacher in a small New England town when he gets a visit from an old college friend who wants him to stop squandering his genius IQ and eidetic memory and come help evaluate a team of secretive DARPA scientists who are working on a project they claim uses a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to \"fold\" dimensions and as a result make teleportation a reality. They have it working, but for some reason are reluctant to share its secrets or move it out of the testing phase. Mike is sent in to investigate what the delay is and why no one is willing to talk about the science behind the machine! The story proved to be very engaging and entertaining. It had plenty of mystery, humor, and a batch of cool twists. Mike proved to be a very likable guy who was uniquely skilled to lead the investigation. The rest of the characters were an interesting enough batch. I loved reading this one. I was not bored for a single moment with the story and I loved all the pop culture references Clines managed to squeeze into the tale. This only issue I had with this book was the ending. It was decent, but not as good as the rest of the book. This was set in the same world as Peter Clines 14, but could easily be read as a standalone. Since I loved both books I really hope we get a few more books in this world.

In The Fold I met and developed a huge crush on Leland \u201cMike\u201d Erikson. Now Mike is a genius who has an eidetic memory but he teaches high school English Literature. Mr. Clines had me at genius and English Literature. Everything seems great in Mike's life until an old friend comes knocking with a job he finally can\u2019t refuse. Scientists working on a DoD project in the desert have created something that will change the world as we know it, but something seems a little off, and Mike\u2019s just the man to get to the bottom of it.Before we get too far into the action we get more insight into what it's like to be Mike. I can't tell you how many times during the course of reading about Mike's cognitive abilities that I secretly wished my brain functioned in the same manner. But then we get to see the flip side to having a photographic memory, we get to see the bad side. See Mike can never forget ANYTHING. He relives moments in full Technicolor with every detail vivid and full of life. Stop to think for a moment just how awful that could be when the memories are the horrible ones. Just imagine how many life events and traumatic experiences we encounter in our lifetime. If you are like me you try your best to forget those things, put them behind you and try to move on without letting them scar you. Mike can't forget them. All the hurtful moments, all the loss, all the grief, it stays with him forever just like it happened yesterday. I loved how Mike was fleshed out for us, I admired him yet felt sorry for him. This book starts off as a current-day science thriller, where the pace pushes you toward the next page and chapter without mercy or a break, and runs you straight into a left turn revealing an Eldritch-style horror story that gets weirder as it does dangerous. There\u2019s a lot going once things really get moving, and you think that there can\u2019t possibly be any way to take even more air out of an already quick read, but Clines manages to do just that. The final fifty pages will hold you to the end. This is a great summer read, perfect for techno-junkies who love their sci-fi references authentic (Clines shows his massive love for Trek science and does each with deep cuts that will tickle any other hardcore fan.) and those who really dig mind-bending adventures that you just can\u2019t put down. Raising fun questions that will follow you after, this novel is definitely one to add to your summer reading list."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve", "userReview": "I received this from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This was an incredibly exciting book! The first half or so was the set-up, character development, and setting the scene. It started out like a \"typical\" mystery, with hidden agendas, secret agents, and the like. At about the 55% mark, things took a swing, and by that, I mean a WILD swing! The tension ratcheted up with each new discovery, and there were some truly surprising twists. By the 80% point, I couldn't put the book down!I'm also in the middle of Peter Clines' book, \"14\". There are some interesting ties between the two books, things that I probably wouldn't have caught if I read them months or years apart. In the Afterword of The Fold, he mentions some of them, and in an interesting comment, said that while The Fold isn't a direct sequel, it was set in the same world (or something like that, anyway). It will be interesting to see if he takes the characters developed here into true sequels (the set-up is definitely in place)."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comWow! That was one trip of a book! I liked it :) I always know I like a book when I can't wait to see what's going to happen yet and I start talking out loud to the book and the stupidity of what people are doing or not doing. I loved one of the main characters, Mike. I wish I could have his mind! I would love to have a smart, photographic memory. I would love to just have a smart brain, but I digress. I loved he was referred to as Sherlock, because who doesn't love Sherlock right? And he uses these references to ants in his head. Whatever works. As everyone knows already, Mike is called in by his friend Reggie to go check on what these peeps are doing over at DARPA. So.. off he goes to see what's going on. They are working on a project they call the Albuquerque Door, which is a teleportation device. I'm not going to give out any spoilers on this, but lets just say, things don't go as planned. I liked some of the characters in the book and not so much others. And of course one of the ones I like.. dies. Figures. In the beginning I didn't like Jamie too much but she grew on me as the book went on, probably because she changed so to speak. The story to me was out there, no pun intended this being a sci-fi book and all, and I thought it had a good storyline. I'm not sure if it matters that I didn't read the first book, but I thought this seemed to be fine was a stand alone. With the exception of a couple of things, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and loved all of the craziness this author brought to the table! I think I might have to go back and read the first one!

The MC, Mike, has a 180+ IQ and an eidetic memory, both of which make him the perfect candidate to observe the secretive scientists who created the Albuquerque Door, a machine which folds the fabric of space across dimensions.As in 14, Clines is able to give depth to his characters and make them seem like real people you may know.

I was really digging the book at the beginning, even up to the half way point. I was fully invested and would easily have rated this at 4 stars. An interesting lead character, Mike, who has an eidetic memory along with a genius level IQ which could have easily come across as a dick but he's actually alright. The interesting plot with a group of scientists finding a way to travel vast distances in space and time through the \u201cAlbuquerque Door\u201d but an underlying suspicions by the funders of the project as to the way it works which meant Mike was brought in to visit the site and be an independent auditor to see what\u2019s going on for himself and feed back to the funders. All good at this point. Even the sciency bits were accessible for me to get on board with, dumbing down enough for even my little brain to comprehend. Then from about the halfway point on, things just went shit. I don\u2019t know whether it was just that I wasn\u2019t able to come to terms with what was happening or if it was just rubbish (looking at some of my friends reviews I would say this isn\u2019t the case) but it seriously went from a 4 star read to a 2 star read from this point on. I found myself drifting with the narrative and wasn\u2019t all that bothered for listening to this but wanted to clear the decks before moving onto something else. I\u2019ve avoided saying anything further due to anything I say being quite spoilerific. The audio narration by Ray Porter was good but not great. There were a number of voices that were well done but I never felt he was a compelling storyteller.

I wouldn\u2019t avoid listening to him again by any means.Overall this was a disappointment. I\u2019d read some good reviews for this and I felt it was going to be a really good read the way the first half was going only for the rug to be pulled from under my feet and leave me disappointed.

The folks in Mike Erikson's small New England town would say he's just your average, everyday guy. And that's exactly how Mike likes it. Sure, the life he's chosen isn\u2019t much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he\u2019s content with his quiet and peaceful existence. \u00a0 That is, until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve: far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to \u201cfold\u201d dimensions, it shrinks distances so that a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. The invention promises to make mankind\u2019s dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the Door is completely safe.  Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn\u2019t quite what it seems\u2014and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret. \u00a0As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there\u2019s only one answer that makes sense.
