It does contain some grammatical errors but it is still one heck of a book.Samantha is a nurse and during her shift a violent and injured man is brought in to the hospital but what's really on her mind is the much needed vacation that she and her husband Matthew are taking to the Grand Canyon. They drop the kids off at her parents house and head off on their trip. Little do they know just how much the world is about to change.I don't do spoilers but I will say that the author's creativity at adding some new zombie abilities freaked me completely out so much that the hairs on my arms stood up. This is a fast paced story with wonderful characters and its chock full of blood and descriptive gore that made my stomach turn. Get ready for the ride of your life as you turn each and every single page. I cannot wait until the release of the second book. This author's debut book is off to an amazing start."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14153681-amy", "userReview": "OMG!!!!

It is a short read; however, I would have finished in one day, but I just recently got out of the hospital, hence it took me a few days to read. I WON THIS E-book in return for an honest review. Now, onto my review! I feel that if this novella was re-edited, thoroughly looked through, and more descriptive, and her characters had more life in them, then I would rate this book a 5 star. There were many grammar errors, for example: \"stifle gas\" when it should be \"siphon gas\". One phrase that stuck out like a sore thumb, that loved being said throughout the entire book was, \"on the floor\", used when someone had fallen. It should have not been used to speak of the outdoors grounds in this way, but instead, she should have wrote, \"I fell on the hot sandy dessert ground\" or \"I fell on the hot sand\", as well as \"on the hot pavement\", when speaking of the asphalt ( parking lot), etc. These would have been more descriptive, than \"on the floor,\" when you speak of outdoors. It would have helped the story flow better. Also, misused words, such as, \"A heard of them chasing us\", should have been, \"A herd of them chasing us.\" I could name more grammar errors; however, I don't like being nit-picky in my reviews, because the review is supposed to be about the actual story; if it was good or not. The plot, the guts of the story is a modern day twist of what a zombie apocalypse would be like in true reality. I actually like this, because it gets you thinking of \"what if?\" Sam, the nurse, who first sees a patient is said to have \"rabies\". Then the rabies spreads quickly from one person to another, and so forth. It quickly evolves into making the infected people more powerful, strong zombie-like person(s), and very intelligent beings. This is a brilliant idea on how zombies could come about in this modern real life time novella.Sam is married to Mathew; he surprises her with a vacation for the two of them to The Grand Canyon, without their two sons for some much special romance time for these two; however, their vacation they had longed for, turns into zombies chasing them! They meet up with Kat one of the employees at their hotel they were staying at during the attack on the train ride. Kat decides to go with them instead of staying and waiting for her sister to pick her up there at her place of work. This was a great add of this character in this novella. Kat helps to bring the main characters together in the story.I enjoyed seeing the zombies start to come to \"life\" in the novella, meaning one talks back to Sam and one of the zombies in the beginning, they begin to realize he is actually following/chasing them. This is definitely something new with zombies. I like this, because it's a different take on how zombies are. One of my favorite parts of the novella was the guy on the radio, Steve, who had just lost his wife, Gina to a zombie. I loved how he was being the \"lone survivor\" with information for any other survivors. By adding this character, it helps to see where the story is going. I hope she continues to keep him in the next book! I am looking forward to reading the second book, so we can find out where their boys and her parents are; if they are ok or not. I'm also hoping the grammar is much better in the second story. Either way, I do like this new modern twist if zombies, because it does add more descriptive ways of how zombies could be in real life. Who knows Kathy Dinisi might be on to something and we should prepare ourselves for intelligent zombies, instead of one track mind zombies! Happy reading!!"}, {"userName": "Sheena", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13359141-sheena", "userReview": "***This could contain things that some may consider spoilers. I typically do do write reviews that will spoil any part of a book, but I will probably mention a few things that some could possibly consider a spoiler.*** I am going to start with the bad, why exactly I didn't give this 5 stars. I think proofreading and editing are very important. There are a lot of mistakes in this book. From using the wrong words (for example: heard when it should have been herd, site/sight, and to/too..just a few) to apparently not even realizing that the wrong word is even being used. After two times of seeing that the characters had \"stifle gas\" out of cars I realized that the author must not realize that the word is actually SIPHON. Or that the sun was DECOMPOSING bodies, not DEPOSING. I will say that I did laugh when a character said, \"Geese, stop yelling at me\" (that is a shortened version but the point was that they meant \"Jeez\"). I know all of this may seem nitpicking to some, but when you read so many books that are carefully written and edited, mistakes likes this stick out like a sore thumb. To me they are a distraction. So that is why I could not give this five stars, which I would have if all the errors were not present. So now on to the actual story. I read all kinds of books and here lately I have read a lot of within this genre. I will say that this was one of the more interesting takes on the \"zombie\" genre that I have came across. I am really interested in seeing how this story ends. I like how this all started from apparently Rabies and that the characters aren't just dealing with mindless zombies that they can escape from and then not have to worry about them. I think it adds a lot of intrigue and potential to this story and it leaves you wondering what is going to happen next. I do think we need to see more character development. At the end of the book, you still don't really know very much about the characters other than little bits and pieces. You don't really feel a connection to the characters by the time you are finished. However, I do think it was a good story and I do want to know how it ends. I do think it is worth reading and giving book 2 another chance."}, {"userName": "Kristin Dutt", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30571943-kristin-dutt", "userReview": "1st let me say this book could be fantastic if polished up and a good formatter/editor was used. I really wanted to love this book. It had great promise but the characters were boring me quite literally and the story line was so simple you could easily see how it would end within the first few pages. The best character in the book was the radio guy I wish more of him was in it. This story really does have potential to be great but more time needed to be put in it. I've read so many zombie genre themed books nothing in this book made it special.Then let's talk about the formatting.....One problem is the chapter boxes were misplaced throughout the book and then at about 77% it went into block mode where what was written was in a square block and just plain horrible when I tint the pages to make reading easier on my eyes. These are simple formatting mistakes but quite frustrating to a reader.Maybe I would've loved this book more if the characters had more \"life\" to them and the story line was more involved. I truly hate giving any book a 3 star rating but feel this novella was just slapped together."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37892898-mary", "userReview": "All for family!!Matthew and Samantha finally get the mini vacation of their dreams. A three day trip to the Grand Canyon. Who wouldn't drop the kids off and run? But fate picks that exact time to drop a zombie apocalypse in their laps. Now instead of enjoying themselves they are in a race with zombie hordes to make it back to their kids safely. The storyline in this book is really good. There is just enough action and it kept me interested. There are several grammatical errors such as word tense or wrong wording (like using feels instead of fills) but it doesn't distract the reader from the overall story. Samantha is a nurse. Being a nurse myself I would have liked that to have a stronger presence in the book. It's like they mentioned she was a nurse and then the apocalypse happened and she forgot how to be a nurse. Hopefully it comes into play in the future installments of this series. All in all this is definitely a must have for anyone Lompoc lover. And I personally can't wait to continue the story to find out what happens."}, {"userName": "Joan Clark", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42507591-joan-clark", "userReview": "Hell Bound: A Vacation from Hell is a quick, action packed read.

The reaction of the \u201cpublic\u201d was realistic in my opinion and kept things fluidly moving along while keeping me interested. Once the action begins it does not end, even on the last page.

Over the last year I have become quite the connoisseur of the zombie genre, most are VERY predictable, ie: disaster to start outbreak, group of survivors, the villains, etc. Well let me just say without spoiling the story for others out there, you gave me a plot twist that I have YET to find in any other series I have read. Good job! Quite literally scared the pants of me. The story was steady paced, not lagging in any places and not overly filled with endless details.
