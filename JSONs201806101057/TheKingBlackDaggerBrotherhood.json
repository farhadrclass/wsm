My fascination with this series started in April 2013 and I can say without hesitation that it has been a consistently fabulous series. 'The King' was received with excitement from myself mainly because since book one I've had a soft spot for Wrath, the Alpha warrior King and as a result you can imagine that I've been impatiently waiting to get my hands all over this novel. There are no words that I can put together to describe how insanely good this series is but for now here are my 'All hail the king' thoughts ...What's it all about?The throne is at threat from enemies made in secret places and a vigilante group of rebelling vampires that desire to see a change in power. Desperate to keep honour to his families name, Wrath must fight for a throne that was never in his heart to keep. With years of having his beloved, Beth by his side Wrath believes they can overcome almost anything but with change comes unrest and this couple are not only fighting an external battle but they encounter battles from within. Follow the continuing storyline of JR Wards most beloved series where we are also discovering more about surrounding characters, impossible romance and an alpha vampire world that you'll never want to forget.What did I love?JR Ward has an imagination that is second to none, her writing style and well thought out story telling is other worldly - quite literally. The Black dagger brotherhood is a series that makes me cry, laugh and smile and there's certainly no escape from 'feeling the heat' Mrs Ward knows how to make her characters burst with lust and longing and she doesn't let her readers fell left out either, her ovary exploding sex scenes would turn a nun to sin. The pages are crammed full with clever twists and turns and ongoing character and story development and I am always kept right on my toes wondering what this author will deliver next. As for 'The King' well I can assuredly confirm that nothing could tear me away from the pages of this novel and as my most anticipated book of 2014 I savoured every single one of the 592 pages. In this particular book of the series you can expect more romance, more action, and more 'getting to know' some additional characters, here JR Ward focuses on the king and queen, Wrath and Beth, Assail the drug lord and his obsession with Sola the human con artist and finally iAm and Trez the mysterious Shadows. Each developing storyline really draws me in, so much so that I have blurred lines of reality when I'm spending time with a JR book. Without question there are not words I have adequate enough to sum up how I feel about this series, JR Ward has me wrapped around her little finger and now I have to wait patiently, or not so patiently in my case for book number thirteen to be revealed. Final thoughts ...If it's a gritty, paranormal romance series that you are waiting to sink your teeth into, then you don't want to miss out on the brotherhood. I can't explain how addictive or how obsessive I feel about this series, but I do know that I want everyone to pick up this series and love it as much as I do. I loved the idea that JR Ward has gone full circle with a story about The king and I can only say that this book made me feel a whole range of emotions from loved up to turned on, to heart break to smiling like a mad woman, so much so that I'm sure I'll not forget. If you already love this series then this book will be the icing on the cake and if you've yet to meet the brothers well all I can say is that you are in for a treat. Go grab it readers, release day was April 1st. Enjoy, kisses.\n**Thanks to my BDB girls for another fang-tastic buddy read.

Rev-visiting the very first and most beloved couple, fighting for the right to stay together and have a chance at happiness.As usual, she just can't stay there... At least 5 other characters and their stories complete this story that follows different directions and tries to make us like heroes and villains, virgins and sluts, commoners and glymera aristocrats. What I liked:\u2713 Wrath and Beth.The reigning couple simply RULES!!! It was a huge plus that we were already familiar with their story and we have got glimpses of their struggles throughout the series. Keeping the main focus on them again flowed effortlessly. They stayed true to themselves and they grew. It was also refreshing that the spotlight wasn't on their sexual encounters but their emotional turmoil and helping the whole vampire race for a change. The threat to the throne brought them more close than ever and the ending simply stunned me!\u2713 iAmIn a sea of POVs and various characters interrupting my love affair with Wrath, the Shadow was a refreshing new voice. Caustic, ironic, loyal and just unable to not care, the chef is a sight to behold and the only thread in this tangled web of stories that I am excited to read.\u2713 Doc Jane*shameful admition* I wasn't a fan... *ducks head*But book by book, her integrity, loyalty, fierceness and dry wit, won me over. Vishous couldn't have found a better mate, Ghost or not.\u2713 Wrath and AnyaGiving us a rare glimpse at the past, we got introduced to Wrath's parents! HOOOOORAY! It was a great emotional sidestory and one of the best parts of the book.\u2713 John MatthewsI LOVE HIM. End.What it bored me:\u2717 X'cor and his BastardsSeriously Layla????? Seriously???\u2717 TrezManslut. End.\u2717 AssailWaste of pages..... Sorry, I couldn't connect at any point. Almost forced to skip...\u2717 GlymeraOverall assessment: \u2713 \u2665Would it be greedy of me to ask for more Wrath? Well, maybe yeah.... But how about Zhadist? Sounds fair right? I need more Zhadist!!!LOL!Pre-release excitementThe next BDB book will take us back, to our first and favourite couple...

You don\u2019t worry about a goddamn thing. Understand me?\u201d Beth wanted to believe him. Needed to. But she feared it was a promise far harder to keep than speak. \u201cBeth?\u201d \u201cMake love to me.\u201d It was the only truth she could put out there that wouldn\u2019t burst the bubble. \u201cPlease.\u201d He kissed her once. Twice. And then started to move again. \u201cAlways, leelan. Always.\u201d-Wrath and BethI loved The King! It was so good. I love when long running series retouch past favorite couples. The King of course is about Wrath and Beth with little bits of the whole gang sprinkled in. And as with all Black Dagger Brotherhood books there are other story plots going on in this book as well. We have Assail and Sola, Xcor and Layla, Trez and Selena, and a surprising plot line of Wrath's father and mother Wrath(Sr) and Anha. Can I just say that Wrath's parents were so sweet and damn was Wrath Sr sexy. I totally see where the son gets it. I loved getting to see Wrath Sr fall so hard for Anha and make her his one and only. It was a little bitter sweet though since anyone following the series knows that Wrath Sr. and Anha are horrifically murdered in front of their pretran son. I still loved getting to know them and see the parallels between the father and son. I knew when I finished the last book that Wrath and Beth were going to be having some problems since Beth caught baby fever and Wrath didn't want a child. \u201cI need you to hear this,\u201d he said in a dead voice, \u201cand know that it\u2019s the God\u2019s honest. I will not service you in your needing. Ever.\u201d Now it was her turn to breathe out like she\u2019d been socked in the gut. \u201cI can\u2019t \u2026 I can\u2019t believe you just said that.\u201d \u201cIt is never, ever going to happen. I will never get you pregnant.\u201d-Wrath and Beth\n\u201cYou can call me Pastor\u2014and before Mr. Sox Fan gets his panties in a wad, I want everyone to know I\u2019m legit. I went online, took a minister\u2019s course in under an hour, and I\u2019m ordained, baby.\u201d Rhage raised his hand. \u201cPastor Ass-hat, I have a question.\u201d \u201cYes, my son, you are going to hell.\u201d-Lassiter and RhageEven though I hated seeing Beth and Wrath fight, I loved seeing them grow in their relationship. All couples have ups and downs and I felt J.R. Ward keeps that real in this series. I totally got were both Wrath and Beth were coming from. I loved that even though Wrath was scared to get Beth pregnant he decided to go for it anyways. Although she was already 4 months pregnant and they just didn't know it. And OMG the way Wrath acted when he found out they were having a son was so damn cute I was smiling like a crazy woman. Now having a child wasn't the only problem Wrath and Beth were having in this book. Xcor was at it again getting the glymera to declare that Wrath can't be King because he mated a half breed and their heir wouldn't be full blooded vampire. I hated Beth's guilt over something she couldn't help, and I hated the glymera more than ever for them using his love to try and strip Wrath of his throne. I loved that Beth was the one that came up with the solution. Vampire mate divorce and a human wedding. The human wedding which was done by Lassiter was hilarious but very sweet too. I also loved Wrath embraced his blindness in this book. He accepted himself and really grew as a mate, father, and King. \u201c\u2026a son?\u201d \u201cYes. A son.\u201d All of a sudden, he felt the biggest, widest, happiest grin hit his face, the goddamn thing stretching his cheeks until they hurt, making his eyes water from the strain, pulling at his temples until they burned. And the joy wasn\u2019t just on his puss. A flush so great it burned him alive flooded through his body, cleansing him in places he didn\u2019t know were dirty, washing out cobwebs that had crept into his corners, making him feel alive in a way he hadn\u2019t been in a very, very long time. Before he knew what he was doing, he burst to his feet with Beth in his arms, leaned back, and hollered at the top of his lungs, with more pride than his six-foot-nine frame could hold. \u201cA soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon! I\u2019m having a soooooooooooooooooooooooon!\u201d-Wrath and Beth\n\u201cMy brother.\u201d Z shoved out his palm, his scarred face in a half smile, his yellow eyes warm. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d Instead of shaking anything, Wrath shoved that ultrasound picture into his Brother\u2019s face. \u201cDo you see him? See my son? He\u2019s big, right, Beth?\u201d She kissed Nalla\u2019s super soft hair. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBig and healthy, right?\u201d Beth laughed some more. \u201cBig and healthy. Absolutely perfect.\u201d \u201cPerfect!\u201d Wrath bellowed. \u201cAnd this is a doctor saying it\u2014I mean, she went to medical school.\u201d Even Z started laughing at that point. Beth gave Nalla back to her parents. \u201cAnd Dr. Sam told me she\u2019s delivered over fifteen thousand babies over the course of her career\u2014\u201d \u201cSee!\u201d Wrath yelled. \u201cShe knows these things. My son is perfect! Where\u2019s the champagne? Fritz! Get the fucking champagne!\u201d-Z, Wrath, and BethNormally I am bored with the Assail and Sola plot but I really enjoyed it in this book. I loved seeing Assail save Sola. I melted a little when he bonded with her. Their relationship really started in this book for me. Their passion was strong in this book. I liked Assail a lot more in this book. At times though there are things about him I really dislike. Like his drug use. Their relationship was rocky and ended with a to be continued feel, but the connection was there and strong. I am looking forward to seeing where these two go. I really don't care about Trez and the forced mating plot. I am however a little intrigued by the Selena and Trez story line. I think they are cute together. What the hell is up with Selena's illness? I liked that iAm was more talkative in this book. He seemed very sweet and I think it was cute that he has never been with a woman before. I have always loved John Matthew and I was so glad he was in this book a lot. It was so sweet seeing him and Beth in a close relationship. I loved how supportive Xhex was of John's seizures. I really wish everyone including John knew John was Darius. Not that it really takes away anything that they don't but I just wish they knew. Abalone and his daughter were new characters in this book. It was fun to see Abalone's father and Wrath's father's relationship and comparing it to his and Wrath. Now for my favorite side plot Xcor and Layla. God I don't know what it is about that chosen and bastard but I just love them. I eat up ever single minute I can with them. I love how sweet Xcor gets around her. I love how vulnerable he is with her but still puts himself out there because he wants her that much. I love how drawn Layla is to him. How she doesn't see him as ugly but fierce, and worthy. That part with Xcor at the mall buying nice clothes for his kinda date with Layla was funny as fuck. I can't wait to get their story. The King was an amazing and fun read. \u201cI abolished the monarchy last night.\u201d Cue the crickets. \u201cWhat \u2026?\u201d she said. \"You told me you didn\u2019t want to be the cause of my giving up the throne. You weren\u2019t. In the end, it was my choice. Sooner or later, someone else is going to make a run at me\u2014and by extension you and him. And then if I die? My son\u2019s going to end up having to fight to keep something that shouldn\u2019t be decided by bloodline. It should be decided by merit.\u201d Beth put her hands up to her face. \u201cOh, my God\u2026\u201d \u201cSo we\u2019re a democracy now. Saxton helped make it legal. And elections are going to take place in a little while. I\u2019ve talked to Abalone\u2014he\u2019s going to coordinate it all. Hell, the guy already had a good slate of candidates. Oh, and the best thing? The glymera\u2019s out of a job. I did away with the Council. See ya, motherfuckers.\u201d-Wrath"}, {"userName": "Midgetbee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8783181-midgetbee", "userReview": "If this was fanfiction it'd be good. But as an entry in the series by the actual author, it's bad. Very bad.The series started off with the typical PNR conventions of insta-love, but ever since Lover Unbound was let down by a number of fans declaring an undying loathing for its heroine, Ward has branched out into a new form of story-telling. Whereas the first four concentrated solely on the main couple and their story, with a few fights in the war and a hint of subsequent couplings, the books after that began to assume a different shape. Subplot after subplot began to emerge, one of which gave us Qhuay, the others finally coalescing in the over-arcing plot in which the glymera (nobility) of the vampire race, dissatisfied with the virtual non-reign of King Wrath, seek his overthrow.\u00a0Add to this a seeming compulsion of Ward's to introduce at least two new characters and half a dozen subplots into every novel since Lover Unleashed and you discover a real problem; Ward barely has the literary stamina to continue the main plot to its conclusion, let alone six, and she is very easily distracted. Very easily.As a consequence The King suffers. What could easily have been a plot in which the Queen wants a child and tries to convince her hellren of the merits of such an idea during a time of political upheaval, because of Ward's need to throw herself into three different POVs and showcase a different subplot every chapter, instead we get a sequence of events in which both act--quite frankly--like assholes, storming in and out of rooms screaming at each other and throwing tantrums like children. That events such as these tie into the central premise of the book, the attempt to overthrow Wrath, is disconcerting at best. Both characters are now so unattractive personality wise that it is hard to root for the survival of the race, let alone whether or not they get the baby Beth so desperately thinks will solve all her problems.At this point in the series there is a definite feel that Ward is taking things somewhere that the characters themselves don't particularly want to go and the books are so formulaic at this stage it's easy to call events before you see them. As a result whereas once an idle daydream of spending an evening in the mansion may have been a pleasant way to pass the time, in order to make the revisits and subplots happen everyone has been made so damned stupid and unpleasant that making your way through a new Brotherhood novel is more of an achievement then entertainment and the pushing forward of her favourites, Assail and Doc Jane in particular, only compounds this.Assail is an obvious retelling of a still existent character with every single redeeming quality removed in an attempt to make him edgy and while Doc Jane is one of the Brotherhood's two doctors and as such should be featured, the prevalence of medical emergencies in every novel since her introduction in Lover Unbound and the attempt at reworking her relationship with Vishous in Lover Unleashed mean that things have gotten to the point where it's a wonder someone can open a door without shattering their arm, leading to a visit in the clinic with the Spectral Surgeon if only so the hurt character can go into raptures about how lovely and awesome she is. As a result no less then two characters completely unrelated to the Brothers have recently been allowed in the apparently super secret compound the Brothers live in, just so they can be treated by Ward's favourite female.While this may seem completely innocuous by itself (and reveal my detestation of that character), it highlights Ward's willingness to throw out the rules of her own world-building in order to push forward certain characters or resolve problems with an easy and completely nonsensical solution, which has been achieved so far by making her characters completely and unerringly stupid. Unfortunately such an approach demands that her readers dumb themselves down too, or at least develop the memory capabilities of a goldfish, as she often seeks to rationalise unpopular actions in subsequent novels. An example of this being the new rules about bonding. In the books prior to Lover Reborn we were told that bonding is a permanent attachment and that if a female died, her bonded mate would be so devastated that he he couldn't live without her, an action that rationalised the need to find a way for Mary and Doc Jane's continued presences in the novels and find a way for their HEA.Unfortunately the events of Lover Reborn and Ward's need to push these events as commonplace completely undermine the central drama of The King. If Tohr, a bonded male, can move on from his shellan's death and find love and happiness with another as a number of others are described as doing in this book, then why can't Wrath? Sure, Beth dying from pregnancy would be bad for him for a while, but with the idea of bonding shorn of all association with the concept of forever, it's hard to think that Wrath wouldn't find someone else he likes just as much a few books later. Coupled with the realisation that with the exception of Wellsie every female has found a way to come back even if the worst has happened, the tension disappears completely.This could've been countered with a compelling installment of the plot to overthrow Wrath, now including newish characters the Band of Bastards, and while the book does contain a degree of uncertainty on that issue for most of its span, the ending is so completely, utterly, and unfailingly stupid that I felt insulted as a reader. It couldn't be more obvious that Ward couldn't plot a political storyline if her life depended on it and as such we are expected to deal with a few scenes of utter bullshit at the end that if thought about for more then a moment, actually creates more problems for their society then it solves. But Ward wanted it wrapped up in order to concentrate on other things. With a seeming conclusion of the Wrath and Beth storyline on a personal front, the political had to be finished up too. It's just a shame there was less time dedicated to an apparent major societal shift then there was to Sola's time thinking how about kind Doc Jane was. Even if it did leave everything exactly the same.And therein lies the problem. Whereas the first four books concentrated in the personal, when something outside of the couple happened, you had the feeling it mattered and that things had changed. Now, no matter what happens everything always ends the same. There may be a new couple or a new baby, but the same people are in the same places--unless they've moved into the mansion-- and everyone's a little less appealing as a result."}, {"userName": "Taryn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2724584-taryn", "userReview": "SPOILERS!!

The 12th book in the Black Dagger Brotherhood. I am obsessed with this series, can\u2019t get enough of my boys. This author could write dozens more books and I would keep on reading. I loved the idea of going back to the beginning- to an original brother. I may have been a little concerned since we\u2019ve already had a Wrath book, but I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was fantastic! I find these books incredibly difficult to review. In each book, we have the main couple\u2019s story (Wrath and Beth in this particular book) but that\u2019s only the half of it. The other half follows several other characters. I will try to quickly review each smaller story along with the Blind King\u2019s and his half-breed Queens.\n\n\u201cYou know what? That shit\u2019s not worth it to me. You\u2019re what\u2019s important. You\u2019re what matters. Everything else- everyone else can fuck off.\u201d\nWrath and BethWrath and Beth have a lot going on. Wrath is getting threatened by many to take what is rightfully his. The throne. Although he never wanted it, it\u2019s his father\u2019s Legacy and he doesn\u2019t want it stolen from him. Wrath loves his Shellan more than anything, the throne included. Beth and Wrath don\u2019t have the easiest journey. I won\u2019t go into the big storyline, but there are issues between them. I\u2019ve always liked Beth and Wrath, but compared to some of the other brother\u2019s stories, their tale in Dark Lover didn\u2019t stack up. I am glad to say that I loved THIS chapter of their story more than the first. I fell more in love with the King!\n\u201cI want you to know something,\u201d he said into her hair. As she went still, he tried to pull something worth hearing out of his ass. Some string of words that were even in the same zip code as what was doing in his chest.\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.\u201cYou are everything to me.\u201dIt was so incredibly, totally not enough- and yet she sighed and melted into him like that was all she wanted to hear. And a bag of chips.\u2028Sometimes you got lucky.\nXcor and Layla\nSpeaking of the throne being threatened... Xcor is one of the ringleaders. He is the leader of the Band of Bastards. And in his quest to take down the King, he has fallen for the unattainable. The Chosen, Layla. The Chosen that is pregnant by Qhuinn. Layla has unexplainable feelings for Xcor. She knows he isn\u2019t \u2018good\u2019, but is he as bad as he seems? I feel Xcor is on the path of redemption.\nIn this moment of triumph, the only place he wanted to be was with the female he could not have.\n\u2028And one of the funnies scenes in the book was his shopping trip...\n\u201cKnock her dead, my man.\u201d\u2028\u201cOh, no.\u201d Xcor shook his head. \u201cThat shan\u2019t be necessary. This one I like.\u201d\n\u2028I am very much looking forward to more of these two in the future, hopefully they will get their own book soon! Trez and Selena\u2028\u2028\nWe\u2019ve gotten to know the Shadows pretty well since Rehv\u2019s book. I love them both equally in different ways. The King focus\u2019s a lot on Trez\u2019s story. Trez is trying to get away from his future. The future he was sold into, the one he doesn\u2019t want. iAm will do anything in his power to help, but things aren\u2019t looking good. The Chosen Selena has feelings for Trez. He feels them too, but he also feels unworthy of her. Their story was left wide open, I\u2019m anxious to see where it goes. Assail and Sola\n\u2028\u2028I\u2019m not gonna lie... Assail was a crazy motherfucker. And I adored him! He is also one of those characters that isn\u2019t a \u2018good\u2019 guy, but not a bad guy either. He\u2019s stuck in between. Sola, his little burglar has gotten herself into some trouble. Even though it\u2019s not in his nature, Assail feels compelled to help her. He wants her. Their story was also unresolved so we\u2019ll see where it takes us... As soon as I finished the book, I was instantly curious about who the next book would be about. There were several possibilities, obviously the three above were most likely. When I found out the 13th book in this series would be called The Shadows, I was stoked. Not only do I want more Trez and Selena, but after that little bomb iAm dropped on us, I can\u2019t wait for his story! \nThis series is spectacular. Full of romance, suspense, steam, action and twists and turns. I can\u2019t get enough of these books. When I start reading, the characters and stories captivate me. I feel sucked into this world. I have such a strong connection to the characters and their stories. I just can\u2019t get enough! Thankfully, Ms. Ward isn\u2019t planning on ending this series anytime soon- we have at least three more books to look forward to in the Brotherhood series! Bring it on!ALL HAIL THE KING!"}, {"userName": "Exina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5309539-exina", "userReview": "[Darius, but Beth named him Wrath, and started to refer to her husband as Big Wrath, and to her son as Little Wrath, later LW.

Oh, how the mighty have fallen.  Sigh.The King is upon us, and as a loyal, albeit disgruntled fan, I proceeded with caution. Despite the arduous and at times hysterical journey, I have triumphed. \nIt was exactly 3% that I realized the error of my ways. I like many of you awaited the publication of what I hoped to be Wards return to her former glory, reconnecting with the characters who started it all. With an omnipresent sense of dread I started The King, allowing my buoyant optimism to overshadow the fact that the last two books were a disastrous blunder. It was then, I read the following: He was the last purebred vampire left on the planet - and when it came to her and sex, he was fully capable of going wrecking-ball to get at her.  And not in the stupid-ass Miley Cyrus poser-sex way - and provided Beth was willing, of course.   \n  If this tickles your fancy, I encourage you to read through my status updates. Quotes of this caliber are in abundance. This book, and I'm being generous even calling it that, is a far cry from what we all know her to be capable of. The sad part is, as a long standing BDB fan it truly is sad for me, that under all the bullshit is an actual story, one I know, love and miss dearly. This shouldn't be called The King, it should be called The Death Rattle of a Dying Series.

You  definitely  need those, they are not jarring at all. \nSo there we have it. Yet another disappointing and bizarre installment of the BDB. I will never do this to myself again.\nBAHAHAHAHAHAHA. YEAH RIGHT.Like a true dementia patient, I will read the next one. I will wait for it's publication. I will speculate on who will appear and what will happen. Perhaps a bit on my favorite brothers? I will get excited at the prospect of more time with Rehv or V. I will read every book of this series until she puts it to rest.\nI know, I know, but it's because in those brief moments with some of my old favorites, I remembered so clearly how much I love these books, this world, and these characters. I've spent so much time in it that it all plays so clearly in my mind. The compound, their faces, their voices, the cheesy sex scenes, I love it all, and above all I am an optimist or some shit.

I kept reading on hoping to get back into the BDB mojo, but there was no mojo to be found.

That said, let's get to my review:**Disclaimer: This review is as spoiler-free as I could make it!Wrath, Son of Wrath and Beth Randall have come a long way since Dark Lover, and it's been my pleasure to accompany them on the ride!When I first read Dark Lover (about eight years ago), I will be honest in saying that my biggest draw was not Wrath or Beth, but the world and the storyline of the Black Dagger Brotherhood and the strange world within a world of Caldwell, New York. While I enjoyed their relationship, it didn\u2019t blow me away, and neither character is my favorite in this series. However, I knew I was going to keep reading the series, and boy am I glad.With The King, I feel that an immensely important chapter has been closed in the Black Dagger Brotherhood, and it makes me happy because I feel that all the Brothers and their Shellans have found peace and the close bond of family, drawing close friends into their net. I also feel a sense of excitement in knowing that the storyline can continue and branch off in different ways and directions, and the waters seem uncharted. While there are tendrils that Ms. Ward has planted in this novel, I honestly don't feel I can predict too much about what is coming next. It's going to be fun to see where the story leads, and I am in no way ready for this series to end.Character Thoughts:WrathI feel we got to see some added depth to Wrath that was very good for expanding my view and appreciation of the King. He came to terms with some major hurts and issues he was facing, and I felt the flashbacks were a crucial aspect of the storyline. Wrath always regretted that he could not save his parents and he divorced himself from the concept of family and his legacy so long out of a sense of fear and guilt. In this book, he came to terms with his past and how his future did not have to be governed or hemmed in by fear. I loved his evolution as a King and what that responsibility came to mean for him. It was joyous for him to get everything he needed, but didn't even realize he wanted. Even though I know things didn't end well for his parents, their powerful love for each other and their son was still inspiring to me.BethBeth's storyline was thought-provoking. She was all over the place emotionally, and I understand why. I feel that she was at some of her deepest lows and her highest highs both in this book. While the story is about her, as Wrath's shellen, I think that more of the story was about Wrath. Her role seems more peripheral, but in a pivotal way. I still enjoyed reading about her character journey in this book. Beth is the best Queen for the race, and I can think of no other shellan to stand at Wrath's side.Beth and John MatthewI think this book explored their relationship in a more satisfactory fashion than any of the proceeding books. They know they have each other's backs, and the readers as well. Also, it shows that although you may have your desired life partner, you also need the connection of family (blood and found). I almost thought the thing Ward said would never happen was going to happen, but it turns out that it wasn't necessary. I like the way the story unfolds instead. That John Matthew remains his own person, and his relationships with others aren\u2019t hinged on his secret heritage.XcorXcor remains a complicated male, not quite likable in many moments, and captivating and deeply sympathetic in others. Since I like my characters complex, he definitely has my interest, and he may turn out to be a new favorite of mine in this series. He remains a wild card in this new series arc, his behavior not the slightest bit predictable. To his great surprise, his feelings for a certain Chosen have opened closed off parts of his psyche, and this cannot be a bad thing at all. I think he will have a potential enemy in his own nest, but he\u2019s not unaware of that. LaylaLayla is on shaky ground, but she is making her own choices and defining herself as a female. In her own way, she may have helped to avert a war that wasn\u2019t going to end well, and that\u2019s a good thing. I\u2019m happy about that. I\u2019m very excited to see where the story leads her next.Assail and SolaAssail is probably the most amoral of the lead characters in this series to date. His behavior chilled me at times, but he was also very sweet in others to Sola and her grandmother. It\u2019s hard to know what to make of him. I hope we see more of his viewpoint. I can\u2019t believe their road ends here. Sola\u2019s in a place where she has to deny the desires of the heart. How long will she be able to tune out the siren call of her unwise feelings for Assail, who logically seems like a \u2018very bad man?'The Shadows: Trez and iAmI am jubilant at the expansion of their storyline. These two promise to be a gamechanger in the series. We will finally explore the world of the s\u2019Hisbe, and what a fascinating world it is. Trez has been running from his past for a long, long time, dragging his brother iAm along for the bumpy ride, as iAm has ever been his self-appointed guardian. iAm will soon step out of his brother\u2019s shadow and find his own destiny, since Trez must soon face the music. Trez\u2019s character is both repellant and alluring. He breaks my heart in many ways, but I feel hope for his future. I am drawn into this exploration of the dark path he has walked. The Shadows, once merely loyal allies of the Sympath King, have their own grand tale to be told.SelenaI didn\u2019t expect her secret struggle at all. Another case of \u2018keep reading\u2019 to see how she will get her happy ending. And she had better!The Usual SuspectsIt's always a pleasure to see the various characters who have had their books, and at the same time, I want more of them. I don't think the WARDen could ever sate my desire for enough of each character, honestly.Overall ThoughtsJR Ward, like every other author, has her own distinctive voice. There are aspects to her storytelling that turn off some readers. While I can see where she can overdo some of her affectations (like the brand name dropping and the copious use of slang), I love reading her writing. I feel that her depiction of the ancient culture of the vampires and their various subspecies is very poetic and dramatic, like an epic in its own way. Her romantic exposition lushly romantic and deeply sensual. It wraps around me like the dark spices her bonded males exude for their mates. Her tendency to adapt an urban vibe doesn\u2019t bother me, because I think it\u2019s an interesting juxtaposition to the very antiquated rituals of the vampires. While I can\u2019t deny that the Black Dagger Brotherhood is at its heart a soap opera (not a bad thing in itself), it\u2019s an enthralling one that draws me in and doesn\u2019t let go of me until I read the last page (although the stories and characters continue to linger deep in the recesses of my imagination long after I finish the books). I feel like the Brothers, their shellans, and their friends/associations are part of my family, and each book release is like a yearly family reunion that I don\u2019t dare miss. If only I was as excited to go to my real life family reunions!I\u2019m sure that I could nitpick about the things I felt could have been better written, but I don\u2019t want to. It won\u2019t make me feel I wrote a better review, and I\u2019m not sure it would change my rating at all. I just want to bask in the glow of a new release of one of my top three series. I don\u2019t drink JR Ward Kool-Aid, but I certainly enjoy her fine literary comestibles. **The countdown has begun until next year\u2019s release.**"}, {"userName": "Aestas Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5604583-aestas-book-blog", "userReview": "OMGOMGOMGOMGGGG IT'S WRATH'S BOOK!!!!!Ward said this will be about Wrath and Beth.

We also, learn of the incidents that turned the former docile King into a Warrior which we first learned about in Lover at Last (remember Wrath\u2019s \nEPIC\n speech to the Glymira, still gives me goose bumps!!) In The King, we get a clearer picture of Wrath, and the recent events that are responsible for him becoming a true King. In the last couple books Wrath has been growing more restless & resentful of his role as King of the Race. He struggles between giving Beth what she craves, needs, and really deserves from him specifically a baby, his duty as King, and his desire to still be a Warrior. \nAs usual, we have multiple side stories. I loved reading more about the intriguing shadows \nTrez & iAm\n, the continuing story of \nAssail & Marisol\n, and \nTrez & Solena\n.I am freaked out & antsy about \nXcor & Layla\n, seriously I have no clue how JR Ward will resolve their bond/relationship and the whole thing is making me nervous. I will say however, that I was a bit surprised that \nXcor & Layla\n had managed to sneak a few meetings, considering how protective \nQ\n was in Lover at Last...just how did she manage to slip away so often? I have many favorite scenes, Beth\u2019s needing being one of them\u2026.holy smokes I wanted to be Beth in that moment, Wrath can service me anytime, anywhere!\n\n\u201cI can smell you,\u201d he groaned against her ear as he ran his fangs up her throat. \u201cThe most beautiful thing in the world\u2026except for your taste.\u201d\n\nBut, I\u2019ve got to say I freaking loved the wedding scene, Rhage, V, and Lassiter were hilarious.\n\n\u201cRhage raised his hand. \u201cPastor Ass-hat, I have a question.\u201d Yes, my son, you ARE going the hell.\u201d Lassiter made a sign of the cross and then looked around.\n\n\n\n\u201cWait, wait, wait.\u201d V waved his hand rolled around. \u201cI\u2019m the son of a deity and she picked you?\u201d\n\nAll in all I\u2019m extremely satisfied with the direction the WARDen is taking with the series, and I\u2019m definitely looking forward to much, much more BDB!!"}, {"userName": "Sophia Triad", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44642860-sophia-triad", "userReview": "[Little Wrath!

Ah shit, no Tohr's book was bad....god, have they all recently gotten bad and we are just glutton's for this stuff? Verily JR Ward has gotten ridiculous with the slang, hip hop references, and the uneven old world language. With alacrity this may be the last book I read in the series. Mayhap...not sure.....Okay I lied - I would read Lassiter, Murhder, I'am, I may even be happy about Xcor's redemption...but we shall see. This was not the King's book - it is a running story of Trez, Xcor, Assail - all major asshats - a back story with The King's parents AND finally, a novella of the King thrown in. JR Ward has forgotten:1. The Brotherhood - where were they the majority of the story?2. Editing - for god's sake woman, GET A FUCKING EDITOR! And if you have one, get a new one. 3. Loose threads - Honestly? The holes in this world are worse than the earth had with the Ozone. The rules have been stomped on so bad, it is hardly recognizable. What worked - man oh man - Wrath and Beth. JR Ward did the King a disservice by including all that other bullshit in his story. It really took away from the real story. Wrath finding himself as King among the vampires, his brotherhood, and within his relationship with Beth. I will not spoil it, but lets just say, Wrath does not let us down not one second in this book. He will always be the one for me!!! The book was long, oh so long, yet the ending will feel like JR sucked on some Nitro and took off at 300 mph.

I actually loved this one. I felt such a connection to Beth and was able to understand her desires. I felt like this story was so much more than the usual lesser slaying and loved how the story really focused more on them as a couple. This is actually one of my favorites in the later books. I felt like JR Ward really hit it out of the park on delivering a story that was emotional and heart felt, but still remained true to her BDB style. If you have taken a break I definitely recommend jumping back in!

Emotional. Blissful.Francesca: Sad. Emotional. Heart-warming.Suzanne: I Love WrathAnnie: LONG LIVE THE KING (Yeah yeah, I cheated.)Did reality of The King live up to the hype?Angela: Yes! He certainly proved his worth and then some. It\u2019s not a surprise who the people will pick.Francesca: It certainly did, and in a way that I was not expecting. But Ward is so great at that. This book was magical.Suzanne: For me\u2026yes it did, in fact it exceeded my expectations! I wasn\u2019t sure what another look at Wrath and Beth was going to entail, would it just be a retelling of Dark Lover? Or them bickering over phantom problems? But it turned out to be much more intense than that and it made me fall in love again, not just with Wrath and Beth, but with the whole Brotherhood.Annie: To be honest, I went into this book trying not to expect anything. I just wanted to be there for the ride. But Ward did something that not a lot of authors can do. She was able to take a couple who already had their HEA and give them something more. Something that not only added to the series as a whole, but also created some development in the character\u2019s lives as well. Ward writes some of the most heartwrenching and touching moments you\u2019ll ever read in romantic fiction.How well does this fit in with the rest of the series?Angela: I think with the turn of events as far as the throne goes, there will be a big shift in how this world interacts with each other. But Ward will have to bring on a big conflict, perhaps in the form of the Virgin Scribe or the Omega or even Lash.Francesca: It\u2019s crazy that I\u2019m saying this, but this would\u2019ve been a great ending to the series if just some loose ends were tied. I would\u2019ve been satisfied with where this ended. Obviously the greedy reader in me wants more and I\u2019m so happy that we will get more. But this book touched on most of our favorite characters, gave glimpses of the lives of many. And it certainly took their world by the balls. THE KING is definitely one of Ward\u2019s best books as of late, I think, because she wasn\u2019t afraid to go in a different direction. To make some major changes in the world. I\u2019m so excited to see what\u2019s to come.Suzanne: I thought this fitted in really well, and not just fit in, but really stood out as one of the better books in the series. It ties up some story threads, whilst continuing others and open up whole new ones, keeping the series fresh, when I believe around Tohr\u2019s book, it was feeling a little stale.Annie: Well, the title doesn\u2019t fit in at all. But despite my initial freak out, I found that THE KING really showcased the \u201cbigger picture\u201d of the BDB world. We see the glymera and their actions towards Wrath, we see Assail and Trez and iAm getting larger roles in the book. Xcor is stepping aside onto another path that I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d see from him, but together, it creates for a story that has its twists and turns while still keeping the several threads of romances going strong with each of the pages in this book. How THE KING is written sticks to Ward\u2019s signature style so there\u2019s much to love there.There were different storylines and POVs in The King, which was your favourite, which was your least?Angela: Well, Xcor and Trez spiked my interest equally. Both men are not so innocent in every sense of the word and they will be paired up with women who are completely opposite of their very being. I can\u2019t wait to see them fall to their knees. But Assail is my fave. He is one hot, very hot hero.Francesca: Obviously my favorite was Wrath and Beth, but aside from the main couple there are many I enjoyed John Matthew because I\u2019m always a greedy whore for him, Saxton \u2013 because he\u2019s a male of worth and I just need a full book about him and his HEA, and surprisingly iAm! I cannot wait to see more of iAm! My least favorite was Trez. If his storyline would\u2019ve been wrapped up nicely in this book I would\u2019ve been satisfied. I really have no interest in reading more about him.Suzanne: I know there are some people who don\u2019t like the different story lines that weave through the books and instead wants it all concentrated on the main couple. But I am not one of those people. I thought the balance of the Wrath and Beth vs the other characters was perfect, there was plenty of the main couple, we didn\u2019t need to spend 90% of the book with them, especially when there were other interesting things happening. The characters story line I thought I would find tedious was Assail and Sola\u2019s, as I hadn\u2019t warmed up to Assail very much\u2026I should have known that Ward would make me do a 180 and I instead found myself looking forward to their POVs. But the POV I found myself loving the most (apart from Wrath and Beth) was Trez and iAm, especially iAm, I canont wait to see what happens with them!Annie: Obviously Wrath and Beth were my favorite to read about. Their scenes together are so emotional that it\u2019s hard to stay detached from their characters. You definitely feel every ounce of emotion Ward puts in her books. I enjoyed Trez and iAm a lot as well. So by process of elimination, I\u2019ll say that Sola and Assail were my least favorite. I do like Assail, but while I admire Sola\u2019s courage and actions, there\u2019s still a lot of questions surrounding her and her purpose in the series. Until I know more, I can take or leave Sola.Wrath and Beth\u2026what are you\u2019re thoughts on them after this book?Angela: I think we will continue to see their progress after this. There is life after happy-ever-after, after all. Just like Z with his girls, life is always a work in progress.Francesca: I have many thoughts. First Wrath was a major DICK! I was so pissed at him for a while because I think he could\u2019ve handled some things better. But ultimately, I fell in love with him in a way that I didn\u2019t think would happen. Then Beth. She started off annoying me a bit with her moods. But once she took control, she showed me a new side of herself. I can honestly say I ended this book LOVING Beth. She\u2019s strong, she took care of her man and what needed to be done. She fought for her man. And the two of them together? Well, just refer to the sentence a bit back where it says I\u2019m in love. Yeah, they were beautiful together. Beautiful!Suzanne: I have always had a crazy obsessive love for Wrath, which has now been tripled, but I now have a little girl crush on Beth. Simply put she was awesome, she had an inner strength and compassion that I couldn\u2019t help but admire. And together, they were fantastic.Annie: IN. LOVE. Really, could you ask for a more perfect ending than that? I cheered, I cried, I panicked and I laughed my freaking ass off too. Dark Lover is my most reread book of all time, but I\u2019m thinking with some time, THE KING will also have many rereads in the future.In general, love or hate this book?Angela: I loved this book. Wrath is and will always be my TOP FAVOURITE HERO. I don\u2019t think J. R. Ward could ever do wrong when it comes to THE KING.Francesca: LOVE! Love, love love. And the main reason why? This book breathes new life into the series. It brings a new love for all the characters. It\u2019ll be the book that will make you fall in love ALL OVER AGAIN with your favorites, and the ones you didn\u2019t think were that special. It showed me why I love Ward\u2019s writing, and how it\u2019s the simple scenes and interactions, a small dialogue maybe, that have such impact on your feelings.Suzanne: Love, love, love. I think this is one of the best books to come out the series, although it may not have the page devotion to the hot \u2018n steamy like the previous books, what it has is a an intense and emotional love story, as well as the beginnings of a few others. It also has some interesting plot development and I can\u2019t wait to see where the story will go from here. And all told in the unique and urban-poetic voice of J.R.Ward.Annie: I want to caress my book. Does that suffice as an answer?Who do you think will be next in the series?Angela: I\u2019m hoping it will be Assail but I have a feeling it will be Xcor. I think he has very strict ties to what happens next to the Brotherhood.Francesca: Xcor and Layla. For me, that\u2019s the only choice. The only one I want to accept.Suzanne: I think either, Trez and Selena or Assail and Sola. I would love it to be Layla and Xcor or iAm and whatever lucky female he shacks up with, but I don\u2019t think their stories are quite as well set up yet as Trez and Assail.Annie: I know Francesca and Angela said Xcor. Suz is going for Trez or Assail, but I\u2019m gonna go for a big, big stretch here and just say Lassiter. Because who honestly wouldn\u2019t more of that Elvis scene? It was definitely the best part of the book!Read my alternate review at Fresh Fiction"}, {"userName": "Sharon \u221e\u2765 is an emotional book junkie \u2765\u221e ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3275325-sharon-is-an-emotional-book-junkie", "userReview": "So we all know this is \"suppose to be\" Beth and Wrath's book and about them wanting/having a baby and while it's certainly that, it's just so much more!I have a love/hate relationship with JRW's writing and I think the deeper she gets in this series, the worse it is. In certain chapters, she was bouncing all over the place and it was a hot mess. \nBut...\nit also allows her to give us many more stories and I do love that. However, it did take till about 20-30% for me to really get into the book and at 592 pages, that took a bit. But that's finally when ALL the stories started to really get a grip on you and get good. This book is broken up into FOUR main couples:\n\u2665 Wrath & Beth:\n Naturally, I LOVED their story. To see Wrath come to terms with what happens was amazing but to see him come through for Beth...priceless. Even though I'm not very happy with how he treated her before, I loved seeing him come unglued in the billiards room! The one thing I didn't get was the whole conundrum with the needing...how could she even have one? And I just love how they are there for each other as a couple. They just get each other...it's a wonderful thing. The flashbacks to his Mom and Dad were interesting but I Loved, LOVED, loved the dream scenes.And I just have to mention how JM was with Beth...it was amazing. I just would've loved to have had more of JM's thoughts. \n\u2665 Assail & Sola:\nWow...I really like these two. The intensity of their feelings are so incredible. I even love how the twins and Assail like Sola's grandma. I don't know where this is going but I'm so on board!\n\u2665 Trez & Selena:\nDang, I had no clue what a manwhore Trez was and his sitch (LOL) is pretty FUBAR but...there is hope. And I love him and Selena together although it's crazy what's going on with her. I cannot wait to get more of Trez and iAm in the next book! I don't know which one I'm more excited about...Trez finding his mate or iAm getting some! And LOL about iAm and the \"goddamn cat\". And oh yea, the crazy sex god, s'Ex...can't wait to hear more of his story!\n\u2665 Xcor & Layla:\nUgh...Xcor - what can I say? I just don't like him and I don't care that he got all dressed up! Too little, too late! And the only thing that redeems Layla is what her reason is. But the worse thing? What in the heck is going on with Throe? That was pretty scary and just creepy and I'm so disappointed! I had such high hopes for him but I would carry Mace too!But never fear, almost everybody makes an appearance although some of them, they're only mentioned. Where in the heck is Mary though? She didn't get discussed AT ALL. I mean I was happy to get some funny moments with Rhage but nothing, nada, zilch about his mate. I'm just going to believe she's off looking for a baby to adopt. Insert *happy thoughts*I did love all the resolutions especially what happened with the throne and the Council (Rehv busts me up!). Lassiter and his outfit was hilarious! The ending was amazing...how could it not be? LW's guards are the best! Bonus points - hardly any talk of Lessers, thank goodness. Now just bring back Lash already!\nRecommendation:\nYou really can't miss this book if you want to continue on with series. There's just too many things going on that you would miss and of course, why would you want to miss the soft side of Wrath? \nFavorite quotes:\n\u2665 \u201cI am the King, you realize.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m the daughter of a deity, motherfucker.\u201d(Best comeback ever!)\u2665 \"Wrath - Beth \u00d7 Overnight = Psycho-hose Beast.\"\u2665 \"And hell, when she thought about it logically, getting True Love along with Happily Married and Hot Sex Life was already one hell of a trifecta.\"\u2665 \u201cHoly shit.\u201d Rehv shook his head and muttered, \u201cNow we know what the zombie apocalypse looks like.\u201d\u2665 \u201cI\u2019m not strong enough for this,\u201d he whispered in her ear\u2014like he didn\u2019t want anyone to hear that coming out of his mouth.

That's not to say that there weren't some pretty good books to follow--I remember loving Rehv's book (Lover Avenged and loving the one with Payne and Manny (Lover Unleashed), and Tohr's book (Lover Reborn, and okay I loved JM's book too (Lover Mine) but they're not books about the Brothers (except Tohr), so they're just a tiny step below. So even though this book was partly about Wrath, I didn't have unreasonable expectations going in. And, I was pleasantly surprised. Not knocked out, but very satisfied.Highlights: ( possible spoilers ahead)*Wrath and Beth are at odds. Beth wants a baby, Wrath does not. Wrath hates much of the details that go in to being a King, and has moments where he wouldn't care if he was toppled from the throne. Until he has his eyes opened (not literally, unfortunately) and sees a better way to rule...Loved everything about this storyline. I thought we knew all about Beth and Wrath, but Ward has way more to tell.:)Wrath...\nBeth...\n*Drug dealing, cocaine sniffing Assail saves Sola from kidnappers, and they hook up. It's hot, it's exciting, but Marisol sees no future in it if Assail can't give up his lifestyle...This storyline is far from over. Marisol may have moved far away, but Assail is constantly on her mind.I'm really starting to get into this sexy couple...Assail...\n*Trez is getting tired of nailing everything in a skirt and is doing everything he can think of to avoid his unwanted future. What he'd really like is a chance with the Chosen Selena (who really wants him until she finds out about his past). he makes a deal with the Queen's bodyguard that may buy him some time...I haven't been too interested in Trez until now. His storyline is starting to intrigue me and I like him with Selena. But I am also interested to see the person he's been promised to and has never met.Trez...\n*JM is having seizures and they're connected to his relationship with his \"sister\" Beth. Will they ever realize that he's Darius reincarnated?*Xcor gives up his quest for the throne in order to be with Layla. How is this going to play out? I'm dying to find out! What will Qhuinn think of Layla with Xcor? What will everyone think? Could this possibly be a love match? I can't deny that Xcor intrigues me too...Xcor...\n*iAm--I never gave you much thought but now I want to know more, more, more! I love your relationship with your brother, and I really liked how you were there for Beth. And your sexual history compared to your brother's? What?! I hope JR Ward rewards you with a nice juicy storyline!*Wrath's parents love story--loved it! Loved how it compared and contrasted with Wrath and Beth's love story. Many similarities, but a lot of differences too. Nice bit of storytelling and beautiful connection between the King and the BDB.With this book, I think Ward has wrapped up Beth and Wrath's story. A whole lot happens to them but they come out of it better than ever--and happy. And I didn't realize only 2 years have passed since they were married (2 years--really??)Anyway, Wrath really comes into his own as a ruler and a husband in this story, and Beth proves herself a strong woman and his perfect queen. Love this couple.The rest of the storylines are all left dangling, to be dealt with in the future. Some of these stories have been around for a couple of books, so I hope Ward completes at least one of them. Every time I start a new BDB book it takes me a little time to get reacquainted with the characters, so the first couple of chapters can get confusing. That's how it was with this book--a lot to remember at first, but then Ward's sure hand and storytelling skills kicked in and it was smooth sailing from then on. The book became unputdownable annnnnd had a really happy ending. Really happy.If I could have one wish for this book it would be to see more of the \"Brothers\". In this book we mostly see JM and V and Doc Jane, and that is in small roles. The rest of the brothers either had 'cameos' or just a mention. I realize Ward can't include scenes with every Brother but I wouldn't mind reading 100 or more pages if she could give us an update on the Brothers and their shellans, true?An entertaining read that should appeal to fans of the series and leaves you hungry for more? 4 stars, easy; maybe even 4 1/2"}, {"userName": "* Meli Mel *", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10905711-meli-mel", "userReview": "\u2665\u2665\u2665 4.25 \"All Hail The King\" STARS \u2665\u2665\u2665What a story. It was quite the long read with SO many things going on but I really enjoyed this one.I'm sensing a new pattern with this series since the previous book. The books from now on will seem to no longer just be about the main characters they are suppose to be about, now we will be getting the story lines of so many others as well. I will admit that this was the reason I didn't love Lover at Last as I might have liked to. But in this one, I guess I was expecting it. So, I ended up enjoying it a whole lot more.I'll start with the main story line, which of course belongs to Wrath and Beth. I. LOVED. IT. It was SO great to see these characters again after all these years that have gone by. It was great to see how much they have grown and evolved as a couple. They go through disagreements that make them question their compatibility. I absolutely LOVED Wrath in this one. Sure, I didn't always agree with the way he handled things but by the end, I had a HUGE grin. I was that overjoyed for them. I even really liked Beth despite her stubbornness. I really liked that she wasn't a push over and stood up for herself. I like that she keeps Wrath on his toes. The ending of this book was so freaking fantastic. I just can't wait to see how everything that happen will change the future of the brotherhood. It was quite the turn of events but I'm hoping it will be positive for them all.I was one of the few that actually was interested in Assail when I read, Lover At Last. Now, after reading more about Assail, who it a total anti-hero, I still want to know more about him. He is pretty smoking hot. He is looking for Sola, after she was kidnapped and does whatever he has to do until he finds her. I really enjoyed the chemistry between these two. I didn't really like how things left off between them, so, I'm hoping something awesome happens in the next book that will cause them to reunite.I'm not going to lie, when I read the last book, I wasn't that big of a fan of Trez or iAm. But that completely changed with this book. Again, I really enjoyed the chemistry between Trez and Selena. Trez feels completely worthless of someone like Selena because of his man whore ways and the business he is in. Trez was freaking sexy but the shadow freaking frustrated me with how many times he left me hanging. Still, I loved him and wanted more. I loved that even though Selena is a chosen, she was bold and assertive. She surprised Trez with her quiet confidence and that's what I really liked about her. This story line also doesn't end in happy terms, so I can't wait to see what is in store for these two characters. I also want to say that I think I may be falling for iAm, Trez's brother. I seriously want him to find a GREAT woman of worth. I loved how he opened up to Beth and really HOPE he finds the woman he deserves really soon.While I wasn't a complete fan of Xcor's story line in the last book, I was still left somewhat intrigued. I loved how Xcor falls and loves Layla. But I am left rather confused as to what exactly Layla's feelings and thoughts are about Xcor. I know she's attracted to him but kind like him because he's the \"enemy\". But she is also afraid of him so I'm not sure where their story is going to be heading. Especially how everything will work out with Layla being pregnant with Quinn's child and all. There wasn't too much of their story in this one, so I'm looking forward to reading how it all plays out.I enjoyed the book completely, but it wasn't perfect either. While I enjoyed everyone's POV's and story lines, I thought it was a bit overwhelming at times too. WAY too many things were going on for it all to be put in one book. I would have liked for this book to have had more of Wrath and Beth than sharing their book with the others. I think a great solution could have been a novella or short for the other pairs. That way we could actually focus on each couple separately rather than getting fragments. So, that was pretty much the only thing I didn't really like.What I did like, was that we got some info on Wrath's parents. I loved their pov's from the past and how it all came to a full circle. That was just awesome. I really loved it! And I was left super happy with Wrath and Beth's ending. I loved that there were a few moments of funny banter--which I wish there would had been more of--between the brothers. I really missed these guys so much. Overall, I thought it was a really great read. And I CAN NOT wait for Trez and iAm's book next!!! So excited!"}, {"userName": "Elise \u2718 a.k.a Ryder's Pet \u2718", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13567836-elise-a-k-a-ryder-s-pet", "userReview": "[Little Wrath (hide spoiler)]"}], "description": "Long live the King... \nAfter turning his back on the throne for centuries, Wrath, son of Wrath, finally assumed his father\u2019s mantle\u2014with the help of his beloved mate.
