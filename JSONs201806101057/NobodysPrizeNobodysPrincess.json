This sequel, however, was too crude. When Helen was dressed like a boy, there were pages of jokes and comments on homosexuality. When she was dressed like a girl there were jokes and comments on sexuality in general. Instead of writing a powerful novel, the author took the easy way out."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/706164-danielle", "userReview": "As far as sequels go Nobody's Prize was average. It didn't wow me or make me go, oh my gosh that was amazing! Actually, it made me mad! The author completely and one hundred percent sets up the ending for a third book; yet chances are very slim that there will be one!Nobody's Prize continued where Nobody's Princess left off. Helen and Milo travel from Delphi, following the trail of Helen's brothers and the other warriors set to join the quest for the golden fleece. On the way they run into a few obstacles but nothing major. Once on the quest there are of course many adventures. The problem I had with section of the book was the whole emphasis on Herkales and his issues. The book is supposed to be about Helen, not some overweight truth-twisting hero. The author portrays almost all of the heroes on the quest as being very arrogant and self centered. Even when we're supposed to be supporting certain characters, because of previous backgrounds on the characters you can't really love them as much as you fee like you ought too. Another issue I had was the authors overall perspective on Helen. She establishes her as character that can defend herself perfectly well, is smart if not brilliant, and becoming more and more attractive; but it constantly finding herself in dangerous situations! Is it because Helen is smart or stupid? That was a major question that plagued me as I read this sequel... With all the negative said, the book is very good. It's interesting to the point of where I was reading it in my Art History class under the tables (bad, I know). I didn't want to put it down, which is always a very enjoyable experience. I loved certain plot twists that allowed Helen to grow and expand as a character. Ultimately, i'm stuck again on the possibility of another sequel. In the first two books the author focuses on what Helen's life would have been life when she was growing up, as opposed to the famous story we all know. The problem is that Nobody's Prize is absolutely begging for a sequel. It wants it so bad it makes poor innocent readers such as me almost distraught wondering how the author would have portrayed a well know story of Helen, when she's a bit older, wiser, and has a face that launched a thousand ships. I can only hope that the author will decide to expand Helen's story and satisfy readers curiosity! Overall, 4 stars for being entertaining despite a few flaws! :)"}, {"userName": "Angee Wentz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1702195-angee-wentz", "userReview": "I didn't like the first book so I should've known better to waste my time on the second book, but I read the word \"love\" on the back of the second book and couldn't help but look at it.

However, it was okay, and it seemed to be one long introduction, so I had hopes that this book would be where the payoff occurred. No such luck. Honestly, I'll give the author credit - it takes a LOT of skill to be able to make the story of Jason and the Argonauts boring, but she succeeded. This book has all the problems of the first one - lots of potential that never goes anywhere. A lot of it comes down to the lack of any emotion coming across. Oh, we're told that emotions are occurring, but we don't feel anything. A character falls off a freaking cliff to his death and we're TOLD that our heroine is upset, while she manages to convey approximately the amount of distress that you would feel if you found a hair in your soup. And that avoiding-the-climaxes thing that we saw from the first book is putting in overtime work here! The author does actually try some foreshadowing this time around (though she seems to only remember this periodically - \"Ooops, better chuck in a quick foreshadow here\") and appears to have a full-fledged plot shaping up. We sail to a strange land where the royal ladies belong to a treacherous cult, accompanied by an estranged prince who is doomed to die if he comes home. Jason plots to steal the golden fleece - a crazed princess tries to kill our heroine with poison and kills the doomed prince instead - the tension is building... ...and our heroine GETS IN A SHIP AND SAILS AWAY.That entire plotline is dropped dead. What? Seriously? The remaining third of the book is spent on some completely unrelated abduction-and-forced-marriage plot surrounding our heroine when she arrives back home, but the author had totally lost me at that point anyway. The one good thing about the book at this point was that it was a really quick read, so at least I'd only wasted one day on it.I just feel so sad when I see potential like this fall on its face so badly. Such a pity."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin", "userReview": "I'd be queen of Sparta one day. I'd marry because it would be my duty to have children and provide the land with its next ruler. If I was lucky, I'd choose my husband wisely and we'd love one another. But between\" You must do this because you're a princess\" and \" You must never do that because you're a girl,\" there was no time left for \"Do what you like,because you're Helen.\" This quest,this adventure might be my only chance to see what it meant to be myself.In the sequel to \"Nobody's Princess\", Helen of Sparta masquerades as a male servant in order to join her brothers and others as they sail with Jason who's trying to obtain the Golden Fleece. Now, many readers felt let down by the sequel, but I would argue it is definitely the superior of the first book.In the beginning, Helen is still as equally stubborn and impulsive as she was in the last book,but as the above quote (which comes about 44% into the book ) implies Helen is beginning to really understand what her future holds. Helen is a female in a time where women remained inside the palace and the men went to war. Helen's brothers can do as they please and they do so by continuing on without a care in the world. Helen is like the college graduate the last weekend before the first \"real\" job, like the single girl the day before her wedding, or the first time mother in the months before the baby's arrival. Quests and adventures will not be of her future but a mere memory of her past.We see this again as Helen makes realizations about love between two people and begins to realize what she does and doesn't want in her future. When held unwillingly by Theseus and his mother, Helen meticulously plans her escape with the help of new alliances instead of blindly thinking only of herself.Friesner's Helen of Sparta leaves readers more confident about her role as ruler.

As in the previous book, Nobody's Princess, Friesner's writing is very smooth and reads very quickly. Unfortunately, I found that the plot in this book jumped around too much. The story of Jason and the Argonauts becomes a quick backdrop for Helen to yet again hope no one finds out she's a girl, including her two brothers who are on board the same ship. Most of the usual Golden Fleece-related events are left out, so the trip to Colchis just seems fast and easy. There are some obstacles thrown in now and again, but when the action seems to be coming to a climax, Helen gets in a different ship and sails toward home! We only get the barest of rundowns of what happened after that, third-hand and later in the book. Ugh.I also agree with another reviewer that the emotion in this book didn't come across very strongly. I am a VERY emotional and sympathetic person - I've cried at everything from Naruto (anime) to commercials - but this story didn't affect me in the slightest. People died and Helen mentioned how sad it made her, but I didn't really feel any of it.Ok, I lied. The most annoying part of the story for me contradicts what I said about not feeling any of it: Milo. Am I the only person who read this and thought that Milo was going to turn out to be long-lost Prince Menelaus, who we know from the original myth will marry Helen? I am? Oh well. I just thought it was excessively crappy to poor Milo to build up his obvious love for Helen for two books, only for her to go \"oh I don't like him that way\" and then he has to run off and find some very weakly-contrived relationship with a side character we happened to have run into before. Laaaaaaaaaame. And yes, I AM a giant sap, why do you ask?The whole ending of the book seemed very sudden and rather unfulfilling. It leaves things wide open for a book three, and I don't know if that will ever happen. Yes, Helen meets Menelaus and he's obviously smitten, but there's very little from Helen about her feelings on the matter. The Fleece quest has ended off-screen, Milo has buggered off and found his own life, and now we're left to assume Helen will continue the story set out for her: marriage to Menelaus and then kidnap by Paris. I for one would like to know more. Does she actually marry Menelaus for love? Does she fall in love with Paris? Because I can't imagine Friesner's sword-swinging Helen being easy to abduct if she's unwilling.Here's hoping that somewhere down the line, Friesner will write book three and answer these questions."}, {"userName": "Jessica Tucker", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6303440-jessica-tucker", "userReview": "Helen of Sparta is the main character in this story. As you can tell she is the princess of Sparta, a city-state in ancient Greece. Her favorite goddess is Aphrodite. Helen wants more out of life. She can't do all of the things that a girl is supposed to do. For example, she can't weave without tangling the wool. Helen wants more out of life. In this book, she's aboard the Argo with Milo, the slave she bought the freedom of, Prince Jason, her brothers, and many more 'heroes'. She wants to join the boys in the search for the golden fleece. She just hopes no one will figure out who she really is. The obstacles in her way are mostly her brothers and then all of the other men aboard the ship. It said in the book that girls could bring bad luck on a journey such as the one they were going on. Or something like that. None of the boys would want her on the journey, if they knew who she really was. So Helen had to devise a plan so that the boys would never realize who she truly was.To overcome the obstacle, Helen pretends to be a boy. That plan of hers fails however in about the middle of their voyage. She has to take care of her 'womanly' issues. So then she passes herself off as Atalanta. Everyone believes her. Prince Jason is so fooled that he starts bragging to her about all of the things he's done and accomplished. It was pretty funny. I loved this book! It was a great sequel to the previous one, Nobody's Princess. Helen is an amazing character! The book was filled with fun twists. One of them left me going ew and no way, another one left me going, \"This can't happen!\" One that wasn't such a big surprise still left me going, \"He can't leave!\" *sigh* It was so good. And at the end, if you know about the Iliad and all that good stuff, there is an awesome tie into it. This book was as good as the one before it."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2385689-erika", "userReview": "Well, this book..It's so long time since I read \"Nobody's Princess\" but I do remember the utterly most important happenings. But jeesh. I don't know what to say about \"Nobody's Prize\". The plot is easy to follow. A giant plus. But I have some annoying ability to be very critic to the books I've read. I think the end of this book is horrendous. But surely I doesn't like endings, so no big surprise. But this one, it's so open.Open like she's going to write a book more. I wish she would.Although I think the persons development was a bit.. weird. I certainly doesn't like the part where Helen is captured by the Athenian king and I doesn't like the fact that Herakles is pictured gay. Nor his weapons bearer, Hylas. I don't know what Ms. Friesner holds against Herakles herself, but I think the opportunity to tell the world about Herakles imaginated sexuality is bad. I know Prince Jason went on the quest for the Golden Fleece, but in the shadow of that I think it is bad way to tell that Herakles is gay. Already from the first time we meet Herakles it says between the lines that there's something wrong. He's affectionated by small boys. Pedofilic. Gross. Really, really gross, and it has nothing to do in a new version of Prince Jason's quest to Colchis for the Golden Fleece. Bad timing!I enjoyed reading the book. I think it's a good book, but there's just some things that totally ruin the book. I like Greek Myths. But I like them the way they used to be told. Of course the truth would be much more boring, and I'm sure the Hydra was no more than a lot of snakes. But I think the way Ms. Friesner choose to tell them is wrong.

While I didn\u2019t particularly love the first story, I found it an enjoyable read, so I picked this up. And in a word: disappointing. It just failed to attract me as much as the first one did.I found the whole of the book pretty dull. Helen just goes through her adventures one after another and I didn\u2019t feel any sort of suspense, rousing action, or connection for the most part with these characters. Despite what the premise said, even while Helen was disguised as a boy, I didn\u2019t believe that she was, at any point, going to be in danger if her true identity were to be found out. None of the male figures who were on the ship made impressions on me that they were going to cast her off, shame her, or do worse.Helen was a lot more aggravating than she was in the first book. She was a lot more selfish, whiny, and if she wanted something then there was no one else who could tell her differently. Milo, her comrade, was very loyal and devoted to her despite any ridiculous antics she threw herself in and I thought that because of that he was a wonderful character.I\u2019m annoyed that this book didn\u2019t get into the real meaty, juicy parts of the Helen of Troy myths and felt the ending was pretty empty because of this. The premise made the book sound out to be a lot better than it did. Also, I\u2019m pretty annoyed that they say Hercules in the premise when throughout the book he is referred to as Herakles. I know they\u2019re the same person but other people might not get the connection and would be pretty confused as to who he is. The best thing going for these books is that they have beautiful covers and draw from the more popular and recognized mythology."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4952748-kathleen", "userReview": "Whereas Nobody's Princess seemed to have fun with the idea of myth and with (re)creating Helen of Troy's backstory, Nobody's Prize struggles to find a coherent and gripping narrative. Friesner becomes too constrained by the events of Greek myth and her Helen falls flat in this sequel--her journey feels less like a development of an intriguing character and more like an episodic series of events loosely built around the people/places of other myths (those myths commonly don't feature Helen, and perhaps, I think, with good reason after having read this book). Friesner clearly has an \"agenda\" in this book and I had high hopes for her ability to offer a feminist retelling of Helen's life. Hence, then, what is perhaps most disappointing about Friesner's book is her failure to explain or tie in the more commonly known bits of myth about Helen's life with her feminist re-envisioning of the character. What happens to the warrior woman Helen only a few years later? Are readers to be left mourning the young, ambitious, spirited, tomboyish Helen? Or are we to believe the novel's somewhat empty platitude at it's conclusion-- that Helen's choices alone will dictate her future? Friesner is a gifted writer with a good knack for pacing events but the larger questions behind her narrative, the thorny stuff is, simply, and disappointingly, left unanswered."}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34030437-natalie", "userReview": "What a terrible ending.

Like, okay, so he just fell off a cliff and died and nobody cared? Oh well, he's dead, too bad, so sad. One minute him and Helen were talking, then Herakles comes, Hylas loses his footing-plop-over the cliff and gone. Never came back, never mentioned again.I was also disappointed that Helen and Milo didn't fall in love. This is Helen thinking: Did I love Milo dearly? Yes. I loved him, but not with the flare of love I felt for Hylas, or the steady-burning love my parents know, or Medea's devastating blaze. Oh Aphrodite, will I ever understand all the forms can take?...And more than once it was clear that Milo loved her back.So, at the end, he suddenly leaves without explanation.

Princess Helen dresses as a boy to be able to sail on an adventure with her brothers and Jason, looking for the golden fleece. Part of the story line involves attractions between the adult men and the boys on the ship. In a few places there are sexual references to \"using a sword and a rod properly\", among other things.

The Argonauts find themselves in several predicaments and it is Helen who keeps a cool head and shows the wisdom of the group. Ridiculous. Helen is also in danger several times and vaguely gets out of it or the way she gets out is completely left out of the story with the author using the phrase, \"Somehow, Helen made it through\" as if the author couldn't come up with a suitable scenario.

Where deception and trickery were present in the first book, and only as a vehicle to get Helen out riding horses and learning swordplay, the second book is layer after layer of lies without any higher purpose than wanting an adventure.

I guess I was disappointed about the love interest and some of the action. It is a neat idea that Esther Friesner has though...doing a fictional story on Helen of Troy. But I wish she had kept the mythology and not explained away the stories of many great myths. For example, she had Harpies...but they were just women warriors. She has the bard exagerate the stories, making the harpies have wings etc. I felt ripped off...she took away the fantasy and made it too real."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4745612-maggie", "userReview": "Easy, entertaining read, but the characters were rather...eh, flat. Kinda two-dimensional. AND WHAT'S WITH ALL THE RANDOM CHARACTERS POPPING IN AND OUT OF THE STORY? Furthermore, both the books I've read today (the other one being Pegasus by McKinley) have incredibly dissatisfying endings, leaving me to wonder: \"...is that IT? You built up to THAT? YOU CALL THAT A PLOT?\" Ugh. I seem to be in a foul mood today."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1346502-rachel", "userReview": "Helen of Troy's back story, (part 2). The Greek heroes aren't that heroic, which is likely the case, and the fantastic elements of the myths all have a more pratical/reality based explanation. Not bad. But since the story ends with the idea that Helen gets to decide her fate, make her choices, and master her destiny, I'd be curious to see what the author actually would do with the part of Helen's story we are familiar with. The set up doesn't much fit with the story of legend."}, {"userName": "Styler Ribarovic", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2437989-styler-ribarovic", "userReview": "I debated actually giving this one star, but some parts of it saved it for me to give it a two. I think this book is tragically written, and feels disjointed. Helen feels way too perfect of a character to get involved in, and it feels like we are just watching stories happen around Helen, instead of stories happening to Helen. The book fell flat in nearly all places, and isn't worth checking out."}], "description": "In this rousing sequel to Nobody\u2019s Princess, young Helen of Sparta is not about to be left behind when her older brothers head off to join the quest for the Golden Fleece. Accompanied by her friend Milo, and disguised as a boy herself, Helen sets out to join the crew of heroes aboard the massive ship known as The Argo. Helen quickly faces all sorts of danger. There are battles to be fought, as well as an encounter with a terrifying murderous princess. With her beauty blossoming, Helen\u2019s journey takes her beyond the mythology of the Golden Fleece to Athens, where her very future as Queen of Sparta is threatened.", "title": "Nobody's Prize\n      \n          (Nobody's Princess #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1925831.Nobody_s_Prize", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320513194l/1925831.jpg", "reviews": 345, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33502.Esther_M_Friesner", "name": "Esther M.
