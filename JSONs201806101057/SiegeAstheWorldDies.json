Just. Fucking. Wow!I read The First Days and thought it was an all around great zombie novel with strong characters. A few weeks later I read Fighting to Survive. Only a few pages in did I realize that by that point, I was completely invested in these characters. They got into my heart, they made me laugh and cry, they made me love them uncontrollably, and I always will! Not just Katie and Jenni, every single one. Even crazy Calhoun (he's freaking awesome!). By the time I read Siege, this had become of my favorite series, I didn't want it to end, and I envy those who get to experience it all for the first time. Siege, the final book in the As The World Dies trilogy, is undoubtedly the most emotional of the three, as well as the most life changing. Katie and Jenni are as bad-ass as ever, and as in Fighting to Survive, zombies are only the start of their problems. Even through all the death, through all the despair, it's surprising how much happiness you can feel in every little corner. It's wonderful to see how strong humans can be, how selfless, how much we are willing to do to assure we kick this zombocalypse's ass! Realism is one of the strongest trait of this series. Everything that happens, every single thing - including the undead, is incredibly realistic. So yes, I talk about it as if it was real, because if the dead started walking today, THIS is what we would be facing; this is how humans would react.The suspense, the anticipation, the terror - I can't get over how remarkably well written it all is. Action scenes so intense, flashing from one character to another, making us experience the terror through glimpses of every one's horrifying situation. I could see it so clearly in my head it might as well have been happening to me. Heck, it definitely felt like it was. The emotions are all so deeply vivid. This is it, this is the finale, people die - a LOT of people die, not only is it the first book to ever make me cry, she has me relive these deaths every time loved ones learn about them; every time a character reminisces, it's like a stick to the heart. Really, do yourself a favor, and read these! Don't shy away because it's a zombie book. Sure there are zombies, and I won't be the one to tell you it's not terrifying, but this story is not about the terror and gore, it's about survival, it's about humans joining together and starting over, it's about rebuilding a society that has been torn apart by infinite horror. You will be frightened, you will be touched, you will experience love and loss, and I can assure you- it WILL stick with you!--For more of my reviews, visit my blog at \nXpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Carol.

Most likely it was, but there was too much happening to notice, or I was distracted by the zombies. What I notice now is that someone got out her thesaurus and did her very, very best to replace every single \"said\" with another verb. They confided, decided, answered, suggested and scoffed. It sounds like that point when you know your writing is lacking in skill and sophistication, and you are trying to jazz it up, but can't think of what to do. Then there's the weak attempt to add descriptors. A bit in the pine trees had me annoyed with its 'fragrant' needles and 'crackling' needles (which were they? a little herb secret: usually fragrant and dried don't go together). Even a gun-toting super-Loca couldn't save me when I read about the zombies' \"delighted moans\" as they chomped on a human feast. Oh-oh. Is someone channeling a romance novelist?\"Siege\" begins with a variation on the last two books, the image of Jenni waiting for her baby to poke his fingers under her bedroom door. She's fallen asleep on a supply run, and is rudely awakened by a zombie slathering at her car door. They pick up a few more survivors on the way home, after another zombie altercation, and integrate them into fort life, with the exception of Rune, a Harley-loving medium (as in \"I see dead people,\" not the size. Actually, he's a rather large guy). Troubles at the fort peak again, leading to one of the few incongruities I've noticed in the series--an evil character shoots someone in the chest and they stay dead. The violence results in the survivors realizing they lack medical equipment (!), and the solution is to make a run on a hospital, which have been \"notorious death traps\" (we know this because every character says or thinks so) due to the outbreak first being treated as an illness. The hospital scene is done in best zombie movie style, but it surprised me that we are on book three and the survivors still seem to be failing the learning curve for fighting zombies. On the way out, two of the scavengers are hijacked by a military unit contemplating action against the fort.One thing you can say about Frater is, she knows her character tropes. There isn't much subtlety in the forces of human selfishness here, and that's a shame. Blanche, the fort \"Whore of Babylon\" (as labelled by Frater in the chapter heading), and her sister, the equally selfish and evil senator, are described without nuance, and run true to every rich-witch stereotype, even though they apparently grew up in the trailer park. They had multiple plastic surgeries, are racist, have affairs, are obsessed with material goods, manipulate men through sex, believe might makes right, and most importantly, they foolishly believe the normal world will return and their wealth will still have meaning. Zombies are such an obvious villain; the interesting part of apocalypse novels is what happens with the human element, and by depriving the antagonists of subtlety, Frater minimizes the drama and opportunities for deeper meaning in her book.Speaking of tropes, when the Vigilante was revealed, I was completely unsurprised, except by the apparent effort to turn him into a schitzophrenic. What a character cop-out--she should have left the character the courage of conviction without mental illness.Ah well, it is what it is, right? Filled with all the best zombie tropes(except for the ones where the heroes turn into zombies as well), it's about what one could expect. This book in the series was a little more self-consciously referential. A little more mystical. I believe there may have been talk of a savior that sounded suspiciously like Terminator. But it was a fast read, a pleasant break, and now the series is done. Hurray for book OCD."}, {"userName": "Peter Monn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26025759-peter-monn", "userReview": "Omg! Best Zombie series EVER!

The novel continues to follow the struggle of a group of civilians that have banded together in creating 'the fort', a new eden in a world that has become increasingly ravaged by the bane of the undead. Unfortunately for Frater, the world seems to die with a whimper, and not a bang. The novel suffers from some of the same issues that plagued earlier novels, namely villains that seem to have no redeeming qualities, and poor characterization. However, some new problems come to the forefront in Seige that overshadow the characterization. For instance, I felt that Seige suffered from too much trying to happen in too few pages. The Seige, with thousands of zombies attacking the fort, gets delegated to the final 15 pages. The rushed pacing leads to a lack of excitement and tension and makes you feel like she just had no idea how to truly write an effective seige (a good example of an effective, bone-tiring, absolutely wearying siege would be Steven Erikson's Memories of Ice). The introduction of the metaphysical of the novel I felt also brought down the action and cheapened the storyline somewhat. Everytime a ghost appeared it felt extremely deus-ex-machina and I would have preferred to see Frater attempt to solve the situations with living, breathing individuals instead of 'I'm a ghost and I came here for an important mission or to tell you something vital!'. I'm not saying that the novel didn't have its good points, it was an enjoyable read that held my attention and Frater is good at manipulating emotions and making you feel the sadness of the losses of some major characters, but overall I felt like this was a weak ending that with some good editing and better framework could have been a much stronger offering."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6703235-ian", "userReview": "There is something going on in Zombie books that I don't fully understand. The idea of a small group of people building a fort to stand against a feared hoard of some kind seems to be a recurring theme in fiction and film. Because I don't really understand the mindset, when I read these stories I find myself spending stupid amounts of time trying to figure out what the author is saying about political or social issues.Jenni and Katie survived the Zombie Apocalypse (The First Days), they found a home and people they love (Fighting to Survive), now in this the final book they must not only do battle with the undead but with a corrupt government which wants to enslave them. I'm sure there are zombie aficionados out there who can talk for hours about the rules of zombie books, the political subtext and maybe even how to survive the coming zombie apocalypse. Not me. I know very little about this genre, and to be honest I don't even know what genre it belongs to. What I can say is this series is thoroughly entertaining and completely addictive. Each book somehow manages to be better than what came before and this the climax is close to perfect.

I laughed, I cried. What. A. Freaking. Ride. I cannot, however, rate this book. I cannot even discuss this book without ruining it for anyone who is reading the series. I'm sad about that, as I would like to let EVERYONE know that this is definitely one for their collection. But to review it would definitely ruin it for other readers, so I won't. I will say that Rhiannon Frater took some serious risks in this book and every single one worked out seamlessly. Rhiannon told us that people died...people we liked. I cried over one death, actual real tears. Best of all, it's REAL. This story reads like it could actually happen, and it's very real. The story flows, the character development is outstanding, and (this is not a spoiler!) MY favorite characters made it. :-)Nice and thick, this book is 383 pages of rich zombie goodness.EDITED TO ADD: I wrote this in my review of the second book in this trilogy:  The second book in this trilogy was a good follow up. Was not as fabulous as the first one, but was still good. I think that was because the threats were more human than zombie. Important distinctions about how humans can be such monsters even when they are technically alive.Having now read the book following the above comment, I have to say that I think Rhiannon nailed it. I was a little leery of the whole \"ghost\" aspect, and wondering where she was going with the human rather than zombie threat at the end of Book 2. I wasn't sure I was loving where it looked like she was heading with the human threat, but gawdamn she nailed both the mystical aspect (ghosts) AND the human threat, while still keeping the rotting shamblers front and center.

I loved how everything was concluded because it was far from perfect and typical of what one might expect from a world with zombies: nothing ever goes right and NO ONE is safe!! In Siege, fighting the zombies has become the least of their worries. After a member of their community betrays them it causes everyone to realize that the zombies are not the only things that people need to fear.The thing I loved most about this small community of survivors was how strong, independent and extremely resilient they all were. (Almost) everyone was ready and willing to work hard and do their part in the community but of course there were the individuals that still thought themselves better in various ways and wouldn't be 'reduced' to menial labor. Those particular characters cracked me up because I know for a fact there will always be those people in the world; especially the women still wearing high heels and makeup while the world is going to shit. This one had me on the edge of my seat for almost the entire story. It was exciting, nerve-racking, emotional and incredibly realistic... a real nail biter. A well written story of survival and doing anything and everything to secure it. Siege didn't lose any of its original snarky humor but still managed to be one highly emotional thrill ride. If you're any kind of zombie fan, do not deny yourself this series!"}, {"userName": "S.K.

A lot of really, really shitty things happen too. I'm personally not impressed with one particular plot twist, but the author sort of found ways to make up for it (emphasise on 'sort of' not 'did') and still managed to tell a pretty awesome series.Somehow, I don't know how, this assemble;age of 3-4 star novels ended up equalling out as a five star (Five ZOMBIE stars that is:Twilight it ain't) series for me because it was perfect for what it was supposed to be and delivered everything you need in a zombie series.

The story mainly takes place in the fortress that was built by Texas survivors over the past two novels. Internal issues within the fort leads to one of the main characters being badly injured. A trek to find the appropriate medical supplies leads to an encounter with other survivors, who have their own designs for the fort and the people within it.During this time, issues are made worse by the fact that a huge horde of thousands of undead are staggering toward the fort.On a good note, I enjoyed some of the strategies put forth in this novel. Frater demonstrated some great creativity in this. She also built a few solid characters that we began to hope for during the course of this trilogy.Personally, I expected more. Ghosts begin to appear to people in this book, unlike the previous two. I might have accepted this initially with the introduction of one new character who had spiritual ties and was haunted by apparitions. Sure, I could go with that even with his silly name given to him by his mother \"because she knew there was something special about him.\" It just got a bit silly to me that everyone then became able to see ghosts, even the zombies.I also thought the antagonist was a little ridiculous. Perhaps as a long-time military veteran, I find it difficult to understand why so many film makers and authors feel that soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen would simply follow orders without question from any politician or officer regardless of the insanity in such orders. I don't know. In this story, soldiers were enforcing some ludicrous rules under the guidance of a politician.Another thing while I am on the subject of the military is titles. The grade of a lieutenant is seldom used when addressing said lieutenant. In nine years, I never heard a lieutenant addressed as First Lieutenant or Second Lieutenant when spoken to outside of a ceremony of some type. I know it might seem a small thing, but I firmly believe that more people need to pay attention to such details or even ask around a bit.Another thing that got to me was the biker with a bagful of hand grenades. Has anyone ever thrown a hand grenade here? I have thrown a few. I am not sure how comfortable I would be riding a motorcycle while retrieving a grenade from a bag, pulling the pin from the grenade, dropping the spoon, and accurately tossing the grenade so that it not only hits the intended target area but does not affect me. Five meters. That's what we were always told the blast radius was. Anyway, I thought this hero was a bit out there.I also felt that there were way too many characters who were difficult to follow. I had to skip back in the book a couple times to place some of the names with who they were. In other circumstances, I think we were simply expected to know who all of the characters from previous novels were. I get that this was written as one complete epic. However, when split into three novels it would have been appropriate to fill readers in on the previous parts mentioned in case they were reading this without reading one or both of the previous novels. People do that sometimes.My last area of complaint is that some incidents were just pounded into the reader. At one point, a character is killed. OK. That happens. Two pages later, the author gives us the exact details again but from the perspective of another character. Same details. Just a couple more emotions.As I said, I expected more after the first two novels."}, {"userName": "Zombiefan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4513508-zombiefan", "userReview": "A fun read but could've been better. If you want blood, gore, car chases and near-misses there's plenty. But character development was not good for me. A lot of potentially great characters were not fleshed out enough and some who did develop throughout the trilogy were kind of , well, meh. Like the battered-housewife-coming-into-her-own could have been a great character but to have Jenni almost instantly morph from helpless-shellshocked-needy to a horny, wisecracking GI Jane and eventually Savior Of The World lacked a lot of \"middle story\" for me. And Katie deteriorating from a nice strong multi-faceted character in the beginning to weepy, clingy arm decoration for her husband by the third book was equally meh. Even her verbal \"confrontation\" with the cartoonish villainess of this third installment had none of the promised fireworks and added nothing to the story. And although I certainly do not read zombie books for plausibility the introduction of the supernatural ghosty aspect in this third book was weird. I love ghosts and all ghosty possibilities but to have them become corporeal was a bit much and introduced a very deep supernatural aspect that the first two books did not have. The author never previously referred to anything supernatural regarding the way the the zombies came about --- there was constant mention of residual \"brain activity\" and \"reptilian instinct\" and hinting towards some pseudo-scientific explanation for the zombocalypse. So the lack of introduction and buildup of the ghost aspect made it confusing. In this sense the character of the medium (Rune) could have been used really well --- he was one potentially superinteresting character who never got going. In the end he was just a guy who saw ghosts ???!!?? and threw a couple of grenades --- again, a character who ended up meh where he could've been wow. Just like the final battle which ended with a fizzle instead of a bang. I sigh at the potential knockdown drag-out fight with the military that was hinted at but never happened.Still I was entertained although I felt this book (and the rest of the trilogy) had real potential to be much better. Best of luck to the author for her next books, I hope she continues to grow in her craft."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1460100-lori", "userReview": "OMG Rhiannon!!!!

Frater isn\u2019t afraid to shock her readers by killing off certain main characters. This book was littered with the bodies of characters I\u2019d come to know and love.The Fort and it\u2019s residents have to deal with so much, from the violence of the military and government, to thousands of zombies descending upon their beloved home.As usual there\u2019s plenty of action, which moves the story along at a high pace. I really enjoy Frater\u2019s writing style and she always manages to pull me into her zombie world from the outset.There isn\u2019t as much of Jenni and Katie in this instalment as in previous books as we get to see the world from the perspective of many of the secondary characters as well. Although I enjoyed reading about the other characters, I did miss Jenni and Katie and wish the book had more from their view point. However, each character is so interesting it didn\u2019t spoil my enjoyment of the book.There are, however, two aspects of \u201cSiege\u201d that didn\u2019t sit well with me. The first one was the introduction of ghosts. I realise this is a novel about zombies, but I need to believe what is happening to my character\u2019s and the world which surrounds them. Frater does this beautifully. However, the ghost aspect of the plot didn\u2019t really work for me. What was possibly just a sign of Jenni\u2019s madness in the previous novels became reality in this one and it gave the story a slightly unrealistic, and dare I say it, silliness, which made me uncomfortable, as I love this series SO much.The second aspect was a life-changing incident that although didn\u2019t shock me, as I had my suspicions it was coming, it did sadden me to the core. One of the main characters dies!! It wasn\u2019t that this particular character died that upset me, as I think it was a gutsy and brave decision by the author, but that the character made the choice to die even though they had loved ones back at the Fort who depended on them, and it just seemed so out of character. I really want to go into my reasons more but it would be a huge spoiler, so I\u2019ll refrain.The pace picks up speed as it reaches it\u2019s conclusion, lots of tension, action and suspense. And the death of certain characters linger.I can still visualise the Fort in detail, the surrounding countryside littered with hungry zombies, the residents of the Fort, and of course Katie and Jenni.Although there doesn\u2019t look as though there will be any future instalments featuring these two amazing, strong female heroines, they have made such an impression on me that I will remember them for a very long time indeed.I\u2019m very sad to say goodbye\u2026VERDICT:A bittersweet end to an amazing trilogy \u2013 I\u2019ve loved these books, the characters, the world, and Frater\u2019s exciting writing style. Definitely three of the best zombie novels in the genre today and a series I would recommend without hesitation."}, {"userName": "Michelle, the Bookshelf Stalker  Queen of the Undead", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3039709-michelle-the-bookshelf-stalker-queen-of-the-undead", "userReview": "You know you want a copy.... enter now....http://badassbookreviews.com/siege-gi...what are you waiting for?

Rhiannon addresses them all, but you won't like some of the results. That's because she is such a talented writer that her characters are ones you have come to love, care about, have empathy and sympathy for. Her characters are us. And even though we all want them to win, it just isn't always possible in Rhiannon's universe.\" And already, before even starting the book, I'm wondering ... who won't survive? what's going to happen? ... even more so than after reading Fighting to Survive. Rhiannon describes the trilogy as \"...the tale of two women who find a rare and powerful friendship at the end of the world and help rebuild a new one through love and sacrifice.\" I don't want to spoil the series for anyone who hasn't yet discovered it.

More new characters join the group. One of them, Rune, has the ability to see ghosts. But, in this new world, he's not the only one. \"...They haven't really moved on. They're all around us. All the time. Some are stronger in this world than in the other, but they are all caught between the world of the living and the dead. It got all messed up. All the dead rising like that. The natural order of things got screwed up.\" Other additions to the fort feel they are better than the rest of the group and don't need to contribute, but deserve to be waited on since that's the life they have become accustomed to.The group realizes that \"...every moment of happiness ... {is} sweeter because of every other horrible moment {they've} experienced...\". They are all trying to live their \"new life\" to the fullest, taking joy out of the little things while battling the threats they face each day.Very few books make me cry, but this one had me bawling!

As some have mentioned in their own reviews, the ghosts and the metaphysical aspect of book 3 versus books 1 and 2, really made it seem like the writer was using a crutch to answer certain things and to make this work out and it really took away from the story as a whole. I could understand it being used maybe once, twice would be a stretch, but just off of the top of my head there were at least 7 times that it was used and in some cases it made no sense.Not a spoiler, but do we really need to have a ghostly visit from someone to let someone else know they have cancer and are going to die?Calhoun was solid, I think the writer could have used him in a much more effective manner than she did, and could have used him in a lot of places that would have nullified the need of \"ghostly\" visitors. Was it a fun book? Yes. Was it the best of the trilogy? No. Will I ever reread this book again. No.Decent trilogy, but really took a turn downward. Reminds me of the original Star Wars, first two were really good, third one had too many damn Ewoks and took away from the main story."}, {"userName": "Sean C", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14089303-sean-c", "userReview": "OK, this story line really went downhill in this last novel. - The characters became bi-polar. No one rose up against the Senator/Dictator, but they suddenly did later with not one, but two groups choosing to leave the fort.- The introduction of ghosts. Really? Talk about a horribly cheap plot device that is never explained.- The main characters never foresaw the senator's treachery? Really? Did they all suddenly become stupid?- The operation to divert the massive horde. How is it that people in a helicopter can't see crowds of zombies on the ground? This cost them the lives of two of the characters??? - And generally, the author is really took liberties with plausibility to advance the story. The fight between Travis and Curtis.

My first thought was \"Yeah right - now we're getting into some pretty unbelievable stuff\" uhhh... okay, let's think this throuh. They are fighting ZOMBIES, the walking dead, and I had a hard time believing in ghosts! So apparently accepting zombies was realistic to me???

These characters y'all! These characters!Original ReviewNOTE: I feel the need to start my review with a note this time. I have read (and rated) 468 books and have only given 40--5 star ratings. Both The First Days and Siege got 5's from me. I can not stress how well written, brilliantly executed, and boldly told this series is. You must read it even if you don't like zombies. It is a story of humanity, heartbreak, and hope!Updated Note I have now read 903 and have only given 69 5 Star Ratings. This is one of only a few series that has more than one book with a 5 in it. Seriously folks, it is just that good!First Thought when Finished: That is a way to end a trilogy!What I Loved: When a series comes to an end, I look for 2 things: closure and hope. As a reader, I need to feel closure for both the characters and myself. I need to know that this particular phase (emotional, physical, challenge) has been met and that the characters are off to face a new phase in their lives. I also need hope. I need to feel like their world goes on and that they embrace the life that they have been given. That this life (yes I realize it is fictional) they have is worth fighting for and the future (no matter how bleak) holds hope for a better tomorrow with loved ones. These key elements allow me to feel that I was lucky to have shared this part of the characters journey and for now we part ways. Rhiannon Frater managed to break my heart, sew it back together, scare me to death, and finally leave me with hope that these characters that I have come to love would move on from now and into the future! I could not ask for more from a story than what I was given in Siege. It was a very fitting end to what will be one of my favorite trilogies EVER!What I Liked: My favorite thing about Rhiannon's writing (both series that I have read) is her ability to create complex characters in all shades of grey. However, with this series it was her ability to build a world that was compelling and believable. It is not often that you get both compelling characters and a world that almost counts as a character all its own!Updated ReviewAudio Thoughts:Narrated By Cassandra Campbell / Length: 12 hrs and 47 mins By the end of the series, Cassandra was dead on with the characters. I think more than that, she got the emotion and pacing right. I am really glad that I gave the series a chance on audio. It was a good choice!Final Thought: Both The First Days and Siege received 5's from me. I stand behind those ratings 110% and recommend these books to anyone who enjoys a really good story told with a ton of courage and alright just a bit of gore (really there is gore--I have to mention it LOL)! Get thee to the bookstore! You won't be sorry!PS: I am not leaving out Fighting to Survive--I gave it a 4.75! This is probably the highest rated series (outside Harry Potter) that I have given. Truly it was just brilliant!"}, {"userName": "Wendy F", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4019599-wendy-f", "userReview": "[I did struggle with the ghost aspect.

This story continued to go down the \"black guy,\" \"racist guy,\" \"homophobic guy,\" \"rich bitch\" path - the writer seemed obsessive about making everything about race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, sexual orientation. It was as if R. Frater was shoving down the reader's throat the whole way. The story was so cartoonish that it didn't even feel like what the world might really be like if we were forced to rebuild. Don't even get me started on the random ghost intervention at the end. What started out as promising in book 1 ended up a hot mess. I'm sure there could have been a great story with two ass-kicking protagonists - but the story went all kinds of random directions with all kinds of cartoonishly stereotypical characters, i just didn't care any more. I'd recommend the author work on subtlety in her next novel - most people are savvy enough to pick up racial, sexual and other societal undertones without being hit over the head with it."}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5524591-tracy", "userReview": "Whoa, what a ride.

Yes, I know this is just a book... but I became emotionally connected to these characters and unfortunately no one is left unscathed in the final book in the As the World Dies Trilogy... No one!\n\u201cYou are standing on the brink of a new world. Whether the dead or the living rule will be decided. I know you think of yourselves just as survivors, but you are more than that. You are the new Eden. You are the new beginning. There are other enclaves of survivors, but this is the place that was chosen to give birth to a new world. The choices you make tomorrow have ramifications far beyond what you can understand or see.\u201d \nAmazing Characters fill the pages of Siege some you love and some you love to hate but we get and deeper view into those characters that will always our personal favorites. Here are mine and why I just love them... Jenni, damaged, raw, young at heart and truly nieve at times. She doesn't quit. her life changed drastically the day the zombies took over the world and for her it was a turning point, no longer was she a victim of an abusive husband and from that moment forward Jenni grabbed life and lived it. Ms. Frater wrote her so amazingly well, deeply layered and flawed beyond belief. It really was the connection between Jenni and Katie that sealed the deal for me. They have a friendship forged out of survival, a need to live another day but also a deep and lasting love for each other. Katie is strong, confident, beautiful and a heartbroken survivor. In this story Katie has followed her heart and is married and pregnant with Travis's child. Taking on this new world with everything she has, her and Travis have a deep emotional relationship forged out of friendship and love. Bill, police officer and widower, he's still reeling from the loss of his wife to cancer. Bill is transformed by this new world, in a way it gave him his life back or something to live for. He's vital to the Fort, he keeps the people safe and law and order. There is a new character, Rune who comes into this story and shakes things up a bit, he's a medium, yeah like, \"I see dead people.\" In a world filled with zombies and a huge portion of the population is now dead, there are a lot of ghosts out there. Rune, is a bad ass 40 something biker with a heart of gold. He makes his way to the Fort with a bag of grenades and a goatee, finds his way into the hearts of this group.I cannot forget Calhoun, old crazy clone conspiracy theorist that in the end may have been right. He took us back to the laughing even when the Fort was faced with unimaginable odds. You can only really understand him from Ms. Frater words because mine cannot describe what a valuable character he is to this story.\n\u201cDear God, woman! Do you understand the gravity of what I am doing? No, you do not! I am trying to make this fort safe from the messed-up clones.\u201d Calhoun pointed down at the corpse in the road. \u201cThey don\u2019t even have the decency to cover their junk. Heathens!\u201d \n\n\u201cWe need milk and eggs anyway,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cKeeps our brains sharp against the aliens. \u2019Sides, army\u2019s been circling my farm. Don\u2019t need them taking my stuff,\u201d Calhoun said darkly. \u201cDon\u2019t take kindly to martial law. Didn\u2019t vote for that yokel in the White House.\u201d \nNerit, ohh man... I have never wanted to be a 60 something ex-Israeli sniper in my whole life. The women is my hero, she's strong, confident, loved by many, protective of those she cares about and never - I mean NEVER quits. She was like a mother to Jenni and Katie. Nerit took over protecting the Fort, she taught so many of it's citizens how to arm and protect themselves and she was the one that made a sniper out a Katerina. The women rocks!! Plus half the men in the fort, young and old are trying to get in her pants - Love her!! \n\u201cMy boys were hoping I\u2019d ask you out,\u201d Ed said casually. Nerit choked on her smoke. Ed continued, \u201cI told them that you\u2019re too much of a man for me. That you could probably kick my ass ten ways till Sunday.\u201d Half-coughing, half-laughing, Nerit grinned. \u201cProbably.\u201d \nFantastic group dynamics. Can we all say it together \"Sociology experiment.\" Very nice... The Psychologist part of my brain could not look past the interesting group dynamics that the Fort presented. For one, you have a group of people with different beliefs, values, morals and even sexual orientation all gathered together and forced to get alone and survive. I have to say that the Fort became the new Main street USA for many people and at the end of this book several characters really showed their true colors (don't want to spoil anything). Second, how do you feed, clothe, wash, and emotionally support 200 plus people is one small confined environment without fights, rioting or even violence? The leaders of the Fort did this by making the residences feel useful and needed, everyone had a job and everyone participated in the upkeep and safety of their new community. Now at times, this felt too good to be true and in a way it was. But it was still fun to read...Heart stopping action filled the pages of Siege. To the point that the end was a little anti climatic for me. You see there are so many amazing characters lost in the pages of this book that I was laughing one moment and then crying the next. These characters did not go down quietly, i'm proud to say. Each had one heroic death after the other and I was so worn out after reading this book, I almost needed a nap. Ms. Frater brings you to the edge of your seat time and time again, throwing your favorite character, who may have just found the women/man of her dreams, reunited with a loved one or has finally come to terms with living in this new world to ultimately die. Many made choices that shocked me and many sacrificed their lives to save the fort. In the end, my pulse raced and my tears flowed but I could not take my eyes away from the page.\n\u201cUp close and personal decapitations of the zombie kind. I went whacky-whacky with my trusty ax.\u201d \nIn clonclusion, I loved this series, may go down as one of my favorite Zombie series of all time. Mainly because it had everything: Non-stop action, kick ass female heroins, strong cast of characters, and very very funny.\nThey would continue to rebuild, to bring a new world out of the ashes of the old. It was a wonderful world to bring their daughter into. The new parents gazed down at their newborn in awe. Bryce yawned\u2014a tiny pink sigh\u2014as she dozed off. \u201cWelcome to the new world,\u201d Katie said to her sleeping infant."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Siege is the culmination of the As The World Dies trilogy and draws to conclusion the stories of Jenni and Katie along with the rest of the residents of the fort that has grown and evolved since we were first introduced to it as readers of the first book of the trilogy. And while the fort become more of a safe haven for those who live behind its walls, things are no more comfortable than in the past and in fact will become more intense for them all before the story comes to a conclusion. This is by far the biggest of the three books and deals with a great many different plot points, far too many to elaborate on here. Lets just say that Rhiannon Frater has created a very detailed and character rich tale that gives us some really interesting folks leading complex and challenging lives as they fight to survive during the zombie apocalypse. We do get to meet many new characters, based on the fact that another group of survivors, from a mall, are introduced and create some major challenges for Katie, Jenni, and the people they care about. We are given plenty of surprises as the story unfolds and the author is in no way bashful about picking off significant characters. The story is drenched with heartwrenching twists that will leave those who have grown attached to the cast of characters gasping in shock and surprise. Now I am not going to change my tune from my past two reviews-I often feel that this story is almost overloaded with emotions: we are reminded at every turn about the loses these characters have faced and the people they remember and miss that were killed in the apocalypse. Given that this story also has elevated the involvement of ghosts that were only vaguely a part of the last book to where they are key role players in this story, the emotional content gets even stronger here. Many of the characters are visited and spoken to by the ghosts of those they have lost and not only that, the ghosts shape the story tremendously. I felt that their role was perhaps a bit more than they needed to be but that is a minor quibble in the big scheme of things. I have no complaints with how the story itself unfolds. I am always a big fan of turning the readers expectations on their ear and Rhiannon Frater does just that here. She does not give you what you might expect but instead tosses some good curve balls to keep the plot shifting and surprising us. For those who like plenty of gore and action in their zombie tales, this book, like the previous two, delivers. The action can be intense and I particularly liked the sequence in the mall as everyone flees. It was well laid out and choregraphed by the author to give us the maximum amount of intensity. I do have to say I would have liked more of what provides the book its title: Seige. I felt that the final battle with the zombie horde was surprisingly short for the amount of build up that took place before hand leading up to it. That is another minor quibble though, because everything leading up to it is very intense and satisfying as far as action and violence goes. Rhiannon is definitely a girl who is not afraid to get as messy as the boys when it comes to the gore factor. You gotta love that. Ms. Frater is a terrific voice in the zombie genre and beyond that into the realm of horror in general. She creates extremely well developed characters that you can invest in and really grow attached to with great ease. She has a passion that shines through in the story that is second to none and I would recommend this book and this series to anyone who loves apocalyptic fiction. My reviews of the previous two installments in this trilogy were 4/5 stars and this one gets 4.5/5 because I felt this trilogy as a whole is outstanding and this installment gave us a very complex story on its own that comes to a very satisfying conclusion, but leaves you wanting more stories about those who remain to carry on the fight for the human race."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1951344-michelle", "userReview": "Siege is the third book in the As The World Dies trilogy by Rhiannon Frater and a Horror novel from TOR.Blurb:The old world is gone, shattered by the zombie plague.

They\u2019ve defended their home against ravenous zombies and cruel bandits, gathered supplies, established a civil government, and even found love among the ruins.A supply run gone terribly wrong leads to the discovery of another group of survivors, trapped in a failing shopping mall.

My thoughts:It has been almost a year since the world exploded into chaos and the dead began to walk - and feed. The survivors living inside a fort in a small town in Texas have learned a great deal in that time.Safety and security are at the top of the list. The fort has been secured to the best of their ability - with modifications and upgrades taking place as needed. The zombie presence has decreased somewhat, with a handful showing up every now and again and they are easily picked off by the snipers.But there is unrest inside the fort. Some are tired of the status quo. In the confines of the fort bickering can have a ripple effect - causing unneeded stress in an already stressful situation.When one of their own goes missing, the group find out that the military are involved - and they want something from the survivors at the fort.They want the fort.Siege blew me away While reading Siege I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster. I laughed. I cried. I got angry and had to put the book down - but then immediately picked it up again.I became invested in these people from the first chapter of The First Days and hate that it has come to an end. But what an ending. I was honestly surprised with several things that happened in this book - some were good surprises - some were not.
