Heck no! I wrote it. Who better than me to speak about it? What Blackbird is: a view into my own experience of childhood at a time when all I could do was be a first person, present tense witness. I wrote Blackbird from a place of longing to love and be loved as well as to speak to what I saw, lived, felt and questioned about that time. I was digging into the question of mother--as it was time in my life to become a mother. I wanted know my mother--not realizing that I was truly longing for the mother who gave me life. My only memory was of the mother who adopted me and then died after a long struggle with a complex form of tumor growth in her spine. So I began there--with Janet, Bud and then Bryan. I wrote our life and told the story of events that continued to unfold--going from bad to worse and yet--as all dissolved around me--how I continued to move forward and step into each day. Blackbird is a tiny testimony about survival and what we, as humans and as forms of greatness, can endure and transcend. It was not the end though, it was the beginning. The story that came next was Still Waters. But that is a different review. (FIve stars?? YES, I give myself five stars. I give every writer five stars. If you have the courage and tenacity and patience to write and then publish a book, you are a five star writer in my book.)"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/301492-amy", "userReview": "i'm not sure if anyone even reads my reviews so i'm not sure why i write them.i'm on page 222 of this book and it is breaking my heart so much that i'm torn between quitting reading the book or hurrying up to finish it in hopes that it gets better.

It was like a huge wallop of a punch to my stomach though. Jennifer Lauck\u2019s memoir really got to me emotionally; it was a book that I thought about for a long time after I read it. She shows a remarkable resilience for suffering what she did.

Well, in the book Blackbird, written by Jennifer Lauck, that's really all that does happen to young Jennifer. She is a great main character because she is very independent and optimistic. That's part of why I love this book. It's amazing to read how this little girl did everything on her own, even though she had been dealt a bad hand. That makes it very emotional. As soon as she overcame one obstacle, another one just as hard came along. This is why the all of the conflicts complete the book. Blackbird is a great book because it's very emotional. Throughout most of the book, the reader will want to cry. Reading how much this little girl had to go through has touch the reader's heart. You would think after everything that happened, such as when her mom died, she would shut out the world. That's not what she did at all. She tried to make the best of everything that came her way. The other thing that makes it emotional is that everything that happened to Jennifer actually happened in her lifetime. The characters are another reason why I love this book. The book is more interesting to read because it comes from the perspective of a little girl. Jennifer is so full of love and kindness. \"The best part of seeing Momma is how she always calls me Sunshine and how there's that look in her dark brown eyes. It's one of those special looks for special people.\" Jennifer observes and loves even the slightest gestures from her mom such as the way she looks at her.  All of the conflicts make the book complete. The book made me mad and upset when I read everything that happened to Jennifer. It was problem after problem after problem. Jennifer's mom died, her dad remarried to a mean woman with mean children, she got sent away to summer camp and got raped, her father died, her step mom kicked her out, etc. Over the course of seven years, from ages 5 to 12, Jennifer overcame all of those situations on her own. That just proves how independent she was. Blackbird is an amazing book because it's very emotional. I know when I read something, I like to either laugh or read about the characters' emotions. That's what this book will make the reader do if one reads it. The characters also help in doing that. Because the characters all existed and everything they did actually happened makes everything better. I like stories that are interesting, dramatic, and true. It wasn't like there were just one or two real conflicts, there were numerous. So, would you want to read this book?"}, {"userName": "Darby", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1138842-darby", "userReview": "I am a big fan of memoirs and have read dozens. I liked this memoir...it was interesting, sad, and moving. But I felt at times that the author was a bit dramatic in her description of her mistreatment by her \"wicked\" stepmother, Deb, and that she came off as a bit spoiled and bratty. I think that Deb probably really wanted to be a good stepmother to Jenny, initially, but it sounds like Jenny did nothing to cooperate and rebuffed any and all attempts to make that possible in any way. In the end, I think Deb threw up her hands and gave up on Jenny. There is no doubt that Deb was a Type A personality and was demanding of her children. But beyond a few things that she did towards the end of Jenny's life with her, she really didn't do anything evil or wicked.Some of the \"evils\" that Deb forced upon poor Jenny were: making her eat healthy food, participating in sports, exercising, taking vitamins, and doing daily chores such as cleaning the bathroom. The horror! That sounds like pretty normal (or at least in the normal-range) of parenting to me, although she did go overboard with the running. It wasn't until Jenny was forced to live in the church commune that Deb qualified for the evil stepmother moniker. And I couldn't figure out if Deb was really manipulated by the church to do this as a misguided attempt to get Jenny to \"tow the line\" or not, because Deb never made the brother Bryan do that and he tried to cooperate a lot more with Deb and her family. Jenny just came across as VERY spoiled...for instance refusing to take vitamins and flushing them down the toilet, deciding to watch tv instead of doing her chores, being difficult and disrespectful, and just being extremely defiant with everything Deb asked of her. I personally think her own father was more abusive to Jenny by leaving her daily to clean up the awful messes that her own mother left for her and by leaving the family alone for extended periods of time to earn money and have extra-marital affairs. I would much rather eat healthy and jog than clean up excrement, vomit, urine, etc. that she had to do for her mother at age 5. Her brother Bryan was also depicted as being very mean to her.I am always suspicious of someone that is treated cruelly by virtually everyone they come in contact with. I believe that most people in the world are good and kind, and I find it hard to believe that almost every person that touched Jenny's life was evil and cruel. She is one unlucky person!!I hear that in her second novel, that Jenny's Aunt and Uncle supposedly were unkind and treated her like a slave. However if it is like Deb treating her like a slave, that probably meant that they made her babysit and do a few chores around the house. Oh, and supposedly both Deb and the Aunt/Uncle were ONLY after the social security money/benefits that they got for watching Deb. If you have ever looked at your monthly SS benefit statement then you will know that it is not nearly enough to warrant the responsibility of raising a child unless you really want to do that out of the goodness of your heart. In today's money, you would probably receive about $1000 per month in benefits. Clothing, food, shoes, doctor appts., etc. would take about 60%-80% of that...so why would ANYONE do it for the money??? Anyone who has children knows how difficult it is to raise a child properly...would you take in another child for $200 per month \"for the money\"? That is crazy! You would only do that if you really cared about the child...not for $200 (after expenses). That works out to 28 cents per hour. For the money? I think not! Even if they had no expenses and got to keep the entire $1000 per month...that works out to $1.38 per hour. Again, who would do that \"for the money\" when anyone who has children knows that it is the hardest (and best) job in the world???I feel for Jennifer Lauck, because it sounds like her life has been one miserable event after another. I just think that when your life is repeatedly miserable and that person after person is evil and cruel to you...that perhaps you should look inward to what YOU are doing to provoke the misery in your own life. Of course this wasn't possible when she was 5 years old...but I would think that as an adult she could reflect back and see that the people in her past were NOT all evil and that she could see her own contributions to her miserable past.The writers of the memoirs \"Angela's Ashes\" and \"The Glass Castle\" have moved on and seem to be doing so well in their lives. It just seems as though Jennifer Lauck cannot move on and continues to live her life through her miserable past. She has written FOUR memoirs for goodness sake, and she is only in her 40's. Really, it is time to move on and create a new life that doesn't focus on and continually relive her miserable childhood."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/566241-sandy", "userReview": "Memoirs by women are my favorite type of book to read. This book is written from a child's perspective which takes some getting used to. That said, her writing is very good. It is a story of childhood innocence and survival. Her story reminds you of your childhood and how vulnerable a child is to the harsh realities of life. I found myself thinking about being a parent and how incredibly difficult it is to raise children right. To do your best. I believe all of the adults in Jennifer's life (the author's) did their best or the best they could do at the time, but their own circumstances influenced how they behaved as parents.It is a story of hardship and cruel treatment by some adults in the author's life but it does not get weighed down in it. It is not a tear-jerker. However, what the author misses in this story is the development of her adult caretakers' personalities. She gives us a fair understanding of her mother and father but the stepmother is seen as a manipulator and not much beyond. Of course during the entire book I wondered how Jennifer could remember as much as she did. A child cannot see or understand the depth of who their parents or stepparent are. So in most ways, the story is the way it is because she is writing in first person as a little girl who is only able to comprehend what a little girl can. She wants to be loved, she wants to be good. She takes care of her first mother in a way that goes far beyond what a child should be expected to do for her mother. That alone made me question how and why the father did not hire someone to take care of his wife. I kept thinking of their circumstances - how they moved away from their families to live in California - when in my mind, they should have remained where they were - in Carson - so they would have help.Sink or swim. Jennifer learns how to swim but not in the correct fashion - she just swims to stay alive. A wonderful book and one that is going to stay with me over time."}, {"userName": "Stitchintime Hay", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3502087-stitchintime-hay", "userReview": "As a member of the club of adoptees and persons who were in the \"system\", this is a deeply penetrating memoir.

I was completely sucked in and could not put it down. This book will make you never feel sorry for yourself again. It is hard to imagine a young child going through life where no one helped her, not even her own family - specifically - her brother. I suppose that he had his own battle to fight. It brings to light a great deficit in our society, the fact that people are often wrapped up in themselves and turn a blind eye to other's - specifically this suffering child. The book leaves you wanting more. It leaves you with countless questions.

I've got lots of questions, but I guess if she wanted to fill in the blanks she would have done so. I mean, just stuff that sticks in my mind like, were the teeth she got knocked out baby or permanent? Was she without front teeth until dental work was done? Someone tells me a true story and I want to know more where things don't link up or are unfinished. And that would just be the start of my questions.

The author recalls her painful childhood: mother dies when she's about six, father marries a woman who has three children of her own, and then he dies too. The stepmother is appalling: favors her own children, sends Jenny to a camp run by Scientologists (where she's molested), and eventually puts her by herself in a kind of Scientologist homeless shelter. The book is written like a novel (long conversations -- whose memory is that good?), and I suspect there's a lot of exaggeration. The style is simple and sort of childlike, as if she's trying to capture her own voice at that age, but it irritated me.

I'm in awe over how she could find the strength to tell the story from this perspective; it would open up such deep wounds.It reminded me of Wall's The Glass Castle: both authors survived unimagineably difficult childhoods that appeared somewhat normal to outsiders, preventing anyone from taking action to remove these girls from their situations."}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128914-courtney", "userReview": "This is another of the many books that makes me wish goodreads offered 1/2 stars -- I'd give it a 3.5.

It came off an overdramatized whine fest and pity party by a bitter middle aged woman unable to come to terms with her childhood seeking attention.1. While she claims her stepmother was evil I failed to see this noticing only that the stepmother belongs to some crazy cult, forces the Lauck children to join this cult, and believes New Age Whackos can cure her gravely ill husband better than doctors at the hospital. No mention of beatings or starvation. Where is all of this supposed abuse?2. The author spends the summer at some camp run by the stepmother's cult and after being unable to swim when ordered to do so is repeatedly thrown into the deep end by an aggressive counselor until she is nearly drowned and then sentenced to 20 twenty hours of hard labor according to the demerits she is given. Her father happens upon her pulling weeds by hand, is clearly confused about what his daughter is doing and suggests she stop, but ultimately does nothing about the humiliating and sadistic madness his children are being subjected to. Her father was supposedly her hero not to mention that anyone with half a brain would ascertain that this crazy cult needs to be investigated and run not walk to the nearest Exit. What a devoted and loving father Daddy Dearest was to let this blatant abuse of his children continue!3. The author is supposedly sent to live alone in a group home in Los Angeles belonging to the stepmother's cult, because she is obviously very unhappy at home. In this residence she is the only child and must work for her keep then walk 20 blocks one way to get to her elementary school....at 10 years old. The adults are indifferent to her and do not question this arrangement, which I find to be very strange because an unsupervised child is a huge liability and use of child labor is illegal. She essentially drops out of school to wander around the city like a homeless orphan and basically runs wild somehow managing to avoid falling prey to creeps, but no one ever notices or questions why she is out at all hours and the school does not investigate why she is not coming to school,which again is illegal in all 50 states. 4. Her stepmother eventually invites her back to live with the blended family, but says the family is too poor to afford professional movers and apparently no adults are available to help, so little Jenny must move her entire bedroom set by herself to the new residence.....by dragging the heavy furniture for over a dozen blocks one way across busy city streets for several hours in broad daylight. Again I ask, where on Earth do people just stand around and watch something so obviously jacked up like this without intervening and calling the police?! What sane person, child or adult, is going to agree to such a ridiculous not to mention dangerous task?! In the same way 'Deb' arranged for Jenny's furniture to be delivered to the cult's group home she could very well arrange for the furniture to be moved to the new residence and if that could not be arranged then little Jenny did not need that stuff so desperately as to go along with Deb's senseless suggestion! It makes no sense whatsoever. 5. The author is located at age 11 by her aunt and uncle who have supposedly been searching the entire city, the 2nd largest city in the entire country without any of the modern navigational tools mind you, for her and her older brother. They happen upon her completely by chance as she leaves her home and walks down a crowded street. Do I really need to explain why that is about as likely as a pig flying? They scoop up Jenny and her brother and take them to a hotel, but for some strange reason they tell 'Deb' where they are with the children and predictably 'Deb' shows up threatening to call the police if the Lauck children are not returned to her possession. Several weeks later however, 'Deb' abruptly sends first the author's brother away and then shortly after puts Jenny on a bus back to Nevada to her grandparents. How is it that this woman who threatened to report her in-laws for kidnapping just a short time ago, decides out of the blue that she no longer wants the orphaned stepchildren and their much needed source of monthly income? Bottom line is something is not right here and I do not believe we are being given the 100% Gospel Truth in this memoir. Long before the author's relatives 'rescued' her, the stepmother and her whackjob cult should have been reported to the authorities and the Lauck children removed from their toxic influence. In researching this book I found that there has been some questioning of the authenticity of this book and I am inclined to believe the opposer."}, {"userName": "Lori Watson koenig", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13437851-lori-watson-koenig", "userReview": "What a story!

It is intense and while you read you are wishing that it is fiction. It is hard to believe that someone could endure all that this little girl did. I actually found myself feeling very depressed as I read. I contemplated numerous times not finishing because it was so hard to get through. It is overwhelming to think that I can barely even make myself read about what a little child actually had to live. This book brought up a very important question in my life. Should we avoid those things that cause us emotional stress and turmoil because they are bad for our spirit? But in avoiding those realities do we allow ourselves to live in comfortable detached from reality world? There are times while reading this book I wanted to put it out of mind and convince myself that stories like this never happen, that there aren\u2019t children in our world suffering. I felt like it was too hard to handle the reality and it was easier to just ignore the truth. I believe that if we ignore these stories, stop watching the news, and distance ourselves from realities that may make us depressed we can live in a very comfortable world. But, I don\u2019t believe we should. I believe that feeling uncomfortable is necessary to elicit change. If we don\u2019t allow ourselves to feel the pain and sorrow that is around us, we won\u2019t be motivated to alleviate that pain and sorrow. This book has inspired me to do all that is in my ability to help orphaned children. To give a chance to those children that have everything stacked against them. While reading this book I kept thinking isn\u2019t there anyone out there that can reach out and help this little child.

The author---Jennifer Lauck---has a mother who is dying at the beginning of the book, a workaholic father who is often times absent, and a bit older brother who is portrayed throughout much of the book as being very obnoxious. Not just \"older brother annoying\", but downright obnoxious. He seems to have no redeeming qualities. This book is a memoir, so what we're getting is Jennifer Lauck's take on her childhood. And it is a very disturbing one. From the sick mother, to sexual molestation by a camp counselor, a wicked step-mother, and then losing her father to a heart attack when she was ten years old. Pretty rough going. I feel for her. But I found nothing in the book that was even the least bit uplifting. Again though, I must give the author credit for rising above those circumstances that life threw her and growing into a strong and successful woman. The book ends when she is 12 and is sent off to live with relatives. She has written two sequels to this book, that discuss the rest of her life after \"Blackbird\". I won't be reading those.

For me, however, it made this book much more depressing because she is so totally powerless. One thing which bothered me throughout was her misuse of me/I.

Perhaps I find myself once again in a book rut, as it has been a while since I've gotten really excited about what I'm reading.I am sure that Blackbird has its fans, and if you like childhood and adversity memoirs, you may be one of them. As for me, not so much...."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/955366-amanda", "userReview": "SO sad, I read her trio of biographical books in anticipation of meeting the author and hearing her speak on her life's awakening. This book {Blackbird} was my first by Jennifer Lauck and left me wanting more - which was immediately sated by her next book Still Waters, a less turbulent time in her life but still marred with her deep familial scars. Her last book , Show me the Way, was an ending of sorts, but I still have many questions. Jennifer's wilingness to open her soul to us amazes me; her courage is very touching."}, {"userName": "M\u00f3nica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16390342-m-nica", "userReview": "\u00c9ste es el libro de mi infancia.

The story was gripping, and I couldn't put it down.I did struggle with the author's voice, especially in the first part of the book where she is writing from the point of view of herself at age 5. The childish tone, which is presumably meant to be true to a 5-year-old's voice, made the book almost unreadable for me. Here is an example from page 54 the paperback edition:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dr. Smernoff comes over and puts his hand on Daddy's arm. Daddy stands up and the policemen and Daddy and Dr. Smernoff talk the way grown-ups talk, all at the same time.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Daddy puts his hands up and the police ask him a couple more questions and then they close their notepads. The policemen leave and the big one waves at me.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I don't know what to do, wave, not wave, and I just smile and put the sucker back in my mouth.I have read several novels and memoirs about childhoods, but this is the first one I have read that tried to capture the language of a child. I'm not sure if she's trying to evince further poignancy (not necessary, since the story was powerful enough to tell on its own) or to try to be true to the 5-year-old main character. I think it is an unfortunate choice. Happily, the language gets more readable as the author moves later into her childhood, and the last half of the book is much better."}], "description": "With the startling emotional immediacy of a fractured family photo album, Jennifer Lauck's incandescent memoir is the story of an ordinary girl growing up at the turn of the 1970s and the truly extraordinary circumstances of a childhood lost. Wrenching and unforgettable, Blackbird will carry your heart away.To young Jenny, the house on Mary Street was home -- the place where she was loved, a blue-sky world of Barbies, Bewitched,  and the Beatles.
