Both her and 'perfect' husband David, tag team a baton of contempt whenever their ships pass. Their sham of a marriage is founded on psychological co-dependency. David, for his part, is status-obsessed and forensically manipulative - the kind of guy you would happily smack around the chops.But then Rachel -stymied by her past- has become reckless, selfish, and doubly duplicitous. Strangely though, despite her not possessing one single redeeming feature, I found myself rooting for her. I imagine this to be the minority view, however. It's easy to forget, perhaps, that Rachel is herself a long-term victim.It is, at times, a very uncomfortable read, but I applaud the author's bravery in writing such an unsettling, unpredictable story. My second-guesses throughout were usually wrong (which I like), and I loved Whitney's smooth writing style.And, when compared with the other two (highly publicised) books thus far read on holiday, The Liar's Chair wins hands down."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "An extremely clever, addictive and fun psychological thriller, I absolutely hated every single character in this book. HATED them. Loved to hate them and could not stop reading about them no matter how I tried though. Now, almost impossibly, I\u2019m quite sad to leave them behind\u2026So we have Rachel then, telling the story. She\u2019s needy, blames all her issues on other people and is generally not particularly likeable. You may forgive her somewhat when you find out about the man she is married to but we\u2019ll see. After a drunken night with her lover, she runs down a man and kills him. Rather than calling the police she hides the body and returns home to David who is also determined to cover it up. Cue a lot of shenanigans, some twists and some turns, but mostly a terrifically intelligent insightful character piece about a lot of people you most definitely would want to avoid like the plague in real life. They are however extremely authentic and believable. Like calls to like I guess, they all seem cut from the same cloth but with different consequences.What I loved personally about this was that, a bit like \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d on television, it brought out my violent side. Metaphorically speaking of course, in reality I\u2019m fairly placid. But during the reading of this I ground my teeth, growled a lot and often paced around for a bit after putting it aside for a while. As Rachel got further and further into the mire, as she pulled other people into her vortex, despite the fact that she had been through a lot in her life, I found myself being mostly sympathetic towards the dogs and hoping someone would rescue them soon\u2026David is an extraordinarily well drawn character. Ambitious, ruthless, cold as a fish, he treats Rachel appallingly. Rebecca Whitney has explored the theme of mental as opposed to physical abuse here brilliantly \u2013 often its easier to make a character evil by getting them to hit out, but David is much more insidious than that. Still though, I found it difficult to feel sorry for Rachel at all, as I said, I hated the lot of them! Isnt it brilliant?Overall this was a wonderful debut, it will definitely get your blood up, and is written in a way that gets you deep into the mindset of the characters both main and peripheral and will really give you something to think about. It will stay with me a long time \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how I feel about the ending I shall have to ponder!Highly Recommended.Happy Reading Folks!"}, {"userName": "Yvonne (It's All About Books)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17970468-yvonne-it-s-all-about-books", "userReview": "[Finished reading: March 22nd 2016DNF at 42%\n\u201cIn every room the recollection of my childhood is slight, and fireflies of memory disappear as soon as I turn my mind to them.

It hasn't been easy to take the final decision to DNF The Liar's Chair, but I really couldn't bring myself to waste any more time trying to finish this read. Do I feel guilty? Yes. But that doesn't take away I feel releaved that I'm finally able to put a book down unfinished. I normally love a good mystery/thriller read, so I was actually looking forward to this novel by Rebecca Whitney despite the low Goodreads rating. Unfortunately, as soon as I began\u00a0reading the unnatural and forced prose started to irritate me. I don't mind an unreliable or unlikeable character if it's done well, but Rachel Teller crossed the border to I-simply-cannot-stand-you land. Both her voice and her actions really annoyed me and I truly\u00a0struggled to keep reading this story. The plot itself is unbelievable and both the characters and their development don't feel natural. I hate\u00a0being this negative in a review and I'm glad other people seem to have enjoyed The Liar's Chair better, but sadly I don't belong to that group.Rachel and her husband David seem to have the perfect life with a big house and a successful business, but not everything is as it may appear. David is desperate to control his wife, but Rachel is not exactly the woman that can be kept on a leash. She is quite skilled in hiding her secrets, but as she kills a man in a hit and run after she left her lover's house drunk, the image of their perfect life is starting to crack. David insists they pretend nothing happened and makes all evidence of the accident disappear, but Rachel has a hard time living with the guilt of having killed someone. Her behavior becomesincreasingly self-destructive... Can Rachel confront both her past and present and find peace with herself before it's too late?The general idea behind The Liar's Chair sounds really interesting and there have been a lot of\u00a0good\u00a0books published using the\u00a0unreliable narrator technique lately. Unfortunately I don't think this book belongs to that group. I didn't like the characters, Rachel's 'voice' and the prose in general were really annoying and the plot is not exactly credible. I really wanted to like The Liar's Chair, but I really couldn't bring myself to finish it; resulting in my very first DNF read.

Rachel Teller, our narrator, is a woman who was returning to her husband and their \u2018perfect\u2019 life straight from the bed of another man when she rounds a bend and hits a man. Fear of the consequences particularly as she had consumed a fair amount of alcohol she decides to continue on her journey home. As Rachel is to find, removing herself from the scene isn\u2019t going to erase her horror when she contemplates what she has done.Rachel\u2019s marriage to David is the type of strange marriage that could only exist between the pages of a psychological thriller and I failed to understand why she stayed despite being presented with various reasons, none of them felt authentic enough when combined with the protagonist\u2019s actions. David is presented as one of those particularly cruel men who act only out of their own need to be superior, even to his wife and busy partner. Be warned if you don\u2019t like books where the main character isn\u2019t likable, in this book you will struggle to find a single person you\u2019d want to spend more than five minutes with!Fortunately I don\u2019t mind disliking book characters and this book starts off strongly and I wanted to understand more about the Teller\u2019s marriage, their friends and the super successful business that they\u2019d built from scratch and the fact that there was a twin strand of the story back to Rachel\u2019s childhood in the 1970\u2019s only served to pique my interest. This breath-taking start was diluted as the book continued when the marriage unravelled and the story became less taut during the centre section with seemingly bizarre actions being taken purely to progress the narrative. Despite this wobble the author soon got the story back on track to a satisfactory d\u00e9nouement although my initial opinion was that both characters really needed to meet a grizzly and untimely death for being so foul.I have a feeling this one will be popular with those readers looking for a domestic psychological thriller with the emphasis on the thriller and is a perfect read for those times when you need to remind yourself that those people you know aren\u2019t so bad after all.The Liar's Chair is due to be published on 15 January 2015.

As the accident occurs on a lonely stretch of road she panics and drags the body into the trees and leaves the scene.Husband David offers to help her conceal the crime in order to continue to present to the world the pretence of civility and opulent success the couple enjoy, to all outward appearances. But she has just presented him with the perfect opportunity to be more sadistically controlling. Her already dissatisfying, sham of a marriage when coupled with her crippling guilt becomes a trap from which she can only escape inside her head by indulging in increasingly self destructive behaviour. This story illustrates the downward spiral of a woman tortured by guilt and haunted by her own past and present. Neither character is in any way likeable. David is a self centred shit, although I felt his behaviour might have actually been shown to be even worse and I was a little irked by Rachels self destruct mentality, constantly blaming childhood events and other people for her own foibles and rather large flaws.However I really admire authors who can create characters I believe enough to dislike and the rather impudent and shady storyline kept me turning the pages deep into the night, it's dark and disturbing and has just enough of the \"there, but for the grace of God\" about it to make you think, and then think again.A thoroughly enjoyable caliginous read with characters who will make you cringe and a tense, unconventional, truly chilling storyline. My huge thanks to Panmacmillan/ Mantle books for my advance copy.The book will be launched in January - keep your Christmas book tokens for this one and you won't be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Craig Allen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2731841-craig-allen", "userReview": "I went to great lengths to buy this book, well sorta, as it's not available in the US yet on Kindle, so I bought a physical copy from the UK as I really wanted to read it. A good thriller about Rachel, a very damaged woman runs down a homeless man in a drunk driving accident on the way home from a night with her lover. Rachel has been having an affair for years after her rocky marriage with her controlling husband eventually fizzled out. I thought the book would be about the cover-up of the accident, and it was, but there were a lot more twists and turns. There was also the running story of Rachel's childhood and damage inflicted back then.

Sadly, book one of 2015 was not similarly successful. The Liar's Chair was on a list of recommended crime debuts but honestly, I did not enjoy this one bit. The main character is a feckless alcoholic, drugged-up, cheating woman who happens to be married to a man of monumentally domestically absuvie proportions. The thing is, you just don't care. Rachel is not an appealing character - from the very first page when she cheerfully acknowledges that she's driving drunk away from her lover's house, back to her husband, this is not a character that you're interested in rooting for. Her marriage is also ... well, not particularly realistic I don't think. This is clearly supposed to be a portrait of why women stay in abusive relationships but it just doesn't work. You don't feel sorry for Rebecca - she annoyed the heck out of me because here is a woman with the wherewithal to get out of the marriage. I know, we never know what's going on inside an abusive relationship and there's no comprehending why some women stay but this is not a marriage that ever seemed to be based on love. It's a business relationship and the fact that she is incapable of leaving that just doesn't ring true or make sense. If you read the blurb and info for the book it makes it sound like you see this perfect marriage and then discover the cracks beneath but there's never anything perfect about this marriage from day one. They're supposed to be this perfect partnership but it's not until about a third of the way through that you even find out what their business is. The cracks aren't cracks; they're full-on gulfs.None of the characters are likeable. They're all pathetic examples of human beings - there's no glimmer of human decency really in the whole novel. The characterisation is over-done - it's not enough that she should be a cheater, we'll throw in alcholic and drugged up too. Oh, and him, yep, abusive, coke habit and a rather too close relationship with his dogs. They're self-interested, motivated purely by money and are just vile human beings.In terms of structure, we have flashbacks to Rachel's old life which I think is supposed to help us understand her current motivations but it just doesn't. It's cliched, daddy left me, mummy hooked up with unsuitable men, and it just doesn't explain anything about her, or make us like her any the more.There's no ramping up of tension here because you just don't care. I don't care what happens to any of them. As far as I can tell, they all deserve each other!"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/546484-anne", "userReview": "Rachel and David Teller; partners. Partners in a successful business and partners in marriage. How they appear to colleagues and associates is very important, it is important not to let anyone scratch beneath the surface, for if they do, the poison will seep out.It is the morning after the night before. Rachel is driving her shiny, fast sports car down the narrow twisting roads near to their perfect home. She's probably still drunk, she reeks of sex with another man, she's intent on getting her story straight, making sure that David is not suspicious. Her mind is on other things, she certainly didn't expect to see anyone in the middle of the road. God, she's sorry the tramp is dead, but she needs to hide the body, get home and clean herself up.The death of the homeless man with the briefcase is the event that finally fractures Rachel and David's marriage for good. David deals with things in his usual way, he controls it, he pays for it, he ensures that no traces are left .... just as he does with their marriage.Rachel and David are characters who are easy to hate. David is controlling, sadistic, ruthless and incredibly plausible. Rachel is teetering on the verge, she's flaky, she's haunted by events from her childhood and now has the death of a stranger on her conscience.As David uses this incident to his advantage by increasing his terrifying hold on Rachel, she self destructs. There are incidents of self-harming and of casual sex. David's cruelty appears to have no boundaries and Rachel's mind slowly unravels until she cannot function any longer.Rebecca Whitney is a new talent to watch out for. Her ability to create sinister, almost crazed characters is incredible. There is something about this story that makes the reader feel a little grubby whilst reading, there is a voyeuristic feel to it, as though you know that you really shouldn't, but you really can't help but keep watching, and reading.The Liar's Chair is an excellent debut. It is psychologically thrilling, it is challenging and it is often an uneasy read. The author's characterisation is wonderful, but don't expect to actually like any of them, they are a bunch of cold and calculating, yet absolutely realistic people but at the same time are fascinating in a very dark sort of way."}, {"userName": "Jacki (Julia Flyte)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095931-jacki-julia-flyte", "userReview": "Wow, this one is dark.

When the book opens, Rachel accidentally kills a man in a hit and run and this will set off a chain of events which will unravel her.This is a well written book and in the second half particularly the tension is very high. Reading it, I was desperate for Rachel to get back at David and willing her not to be a victim. Be aware that it covers a lot of unpleasant territory and almost every glimmer of hope gets ruthlessly stamped on. This is not a book about pleasant people or neat resolutions.

David and Rachel have all the trappings of a happy and wealthy lifestyle \u2013 only to those, however, on the outside looking in. The pivotal event happens right early on in the book, when Rachel, still under the influence of alcohol (and several hours after her last drink) runs over a vagrant in the road. And it is from this event that the story unfolds. She is on her way home from spending the first night ever with her lover, Will. She staggers around the road and drags the body to the side, and then drives away. She spots a watch belonging to the man, and takes it with her, and it becomes her talisman, her reminder of her terrible deed, her connection to the man. As she arrives home, she slips to the bathroom to gather her thoughts and to shed the evidence of what has happened.Pretty soon Rachel does tell David what has happened, and of course this information is an addition to his armoury, a gift to him in the power stakes. He takes the information on board, almost without batting an eyelid which feels surprising despite the context of what is going on between them. But the knowledge lurks and festers.As the noose of control tightens, Rachel ups her chemical addiction, whether it be alcohol or prescription meds. Little instances push her ever further to the edge \u2013 she puts petrol in her tank at the garage, only to discover that her credit cards are missing, a little control \u201cintervention\u201d from David, a nod to the power he can exert even when he is not around. He can humiliate and control her even in his absence.The vagrant has been living in a derelict caravan, situated on land that David, as it happens, is involved in developing. Rachel discovers the vagrant\u2019s abode and removes an age old picture of his daughter which she keeps with her. And it is almost as if the adult Rachel is driven to find a way to make something right for one young girl. Rachel herself experienced an abusive childhood and nobody made things ok for her, so this is one thing she perhaps can rectify \u2013 if not for herself, then for someone else.There are many strands to this story, and the driver for the reader is to see what outcome the author chooses for the ending. It is a very readable novel, yes, I think one can call it a thriller. Many readers will undoubtedly find annoyance with Rachel\u2019s acquiescent character, but that is the nature of an abusive relationship for the underdog: the sense of perspective becomes fogged, and the less powerful person stays\u2026 and stays\u2026 and stays, even though it is hugely detrimental to them as an individual (research shows that on average it takes at least 30 attempts for a \u2018victim\u2019 of an abusive relationship to leave). The complexities of power and abuse are well delineated. And yet\u2026. It sometimes felt like I was observing their relationship through the fish eye lens of a washing machine (and there is indeed a scene set in a laundry) where the clothes tumble back and forth prior to a spin. The characters acrobat their way through the book, they fade into focus, they fade out. As Rachel slides down the pole of diminishing self esteem, she randomly encounters a \u2018dogging\u2019 group (look it up if you are unfamiliar with what this involves). Indeed, things get pretty down and out for her \u2013 the author deftly describes her demise. However, lewd encounters add very little, they feel gratuitous and serve to underline how far Rachel has fallen \u2013 but that is clear anyway. The author needs to trust that she can convey the harrowing situation without resorting to these episodes that detract rather than add.The writing is pretty evocative, it is as satisfying as rolling a toffee round one\u2019s mouth. But creative writing courses can labour the point of floral writing \u2013 it encourages writers to be evocative in creative ways which easily flip over into a fug of overwhelming flavours. Sometimes the style is a little too florid \u2013 and this is something that author Charles Lambert picked up in his guest blog on Hannah Kent\u2019s novel Burial Rites (http://www.tripfiction.com/novel-set-...), where he talks about \u201dthe attention-seeking language of similitude\u201d\u2026Do go out and buy this book \u2013 you will witness at first hand a relationship where domestic abuse prevails, where strands do come together.

There are many twists and turns, which are hard to predict. I was hooked, even from the first five pages!This book mostly focuses on the characters and their darkness. They\u2019re all cold but absolutely realistic and fascinating people. We see Rachel do everything on her own, showing that she\u2019s strong, even though that she doesn\u2019t feel so. She does bad things, but in the end, we see her feeling guilty about them. The novel mostly focuses on her and her past, we see why she became so flawed and how her relationship with her husband is.The writing style is great and the plot is gripping, there\u2019s a rich use of language, vivid descriptions and many details. The pacing creates a tense narrative, making it hard to put down. It\u2019s extremely well written and easy to follow. A great psychological thriller that you need to know what happens next.Initial thoughts:1. Rachel and David are easy to dislike but for an inexplicable reason, I didn\u2019t hate them, when I was supposed to. I loved their dark side. For some reason, Rachel reminded me of Camille from Sharp Objects by Flynn, I think they have many things in common. Generally, I like flawed characters, because I think that they\u2019re very interesting people. I definitely fancied both of them, but mostly David. Ohh no, don\u2019t gasp, for a strange reason, I loved him, such a fascinating character.2. The end was satisfying but somehow that wasn\u2019t enough for me. I can see that the author intended to make it more realistic and I really appreciated it, some of you may love it but I found it flat. I expected something else, something more dark and that\u2019s why I found it a little disappointing. It\u2019s certainly not the author\u2019s fault, but I personally expected something to blow me away!3. The ending left me wanting to see more, leaving it open for a sequel. I\u2019d love to see Rachel getting revenge. I\u2019d definitely buy the second book, if the author decides to continue the story, but I have a feeling that she\u2019s quite finished with Rachel.It\u2019s easy, disturbing read but at the same time enjoyable and truly chilling. It\u2019s a story that you don\u2019t easily forget, highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13928382-lindsay", "userReview": "Having recently read Keep Quiet which is also about a hit and run it was inevitable that comparisons would be made with this book. However, the hit and run in this book isn't the over-riding plotline in this book - it's sort of a catalyst to the undoing of the protagonist - Rachel.In Keep Quiet, a relationship had been established with the reader so we knew whether we wanted to sympathise and understand their motives for leaving the scene but we didn't get this here, literally a couple of pages and it's happened, our feelings towards Rachel only coming after the accident.And that brings me on to the characters, I don't think I've ever read a book where all the characters are so flawed as this. Actually, not just flawed they're really not very nice people. David is one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever read, controlling and manipulative, just plain bloody nasty and if I'm honest I think this is why I didn't rate the book higher than 3/5. If you can't connect with the characters then how do you have any interest in what happens to them?Although I appreciate and empathise with Rachel and understand why she does the things she does: the car park activities, the pills, trying to find out the victim's identity and about his life all whilst coming to terms with her guilt but why she put up with David's behaviour is beyond me, I couldn't get my head round why she didn't just leave and take him for half of everything. This was frustrating!I'm not sure I entirely understand the relevance of the flashbacks to Rachel's childhood, I assume it's so we can understand the place she's at in her head but I felt her current situation gave her enough to deal with in the present.Overall, it's not a badly written novel, it's well constructed but just not what I was expecting which isn't the author's fault.I also noticed a couple of Americanisms; the use of faucet for instance. As I read the ARC this may well have been corrected.Thanks to the publishers Pan Macmillan for the ARC I received via a competition."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27246754-sarah", "userReview": "I won a copy of this book in a give away in The Book Club, so a big thank you to The Book Club and to the lady behind the give away. The Liar's Chair is a dark, chilling thriller. The story follows Rachel a seemingly happy woman who seems to have everything and appears to everyone else to be happy. Then one fateful night Rachel kills a man in a hit and run and the cracks in her life start to appear. Living a lie starts to take its toll on Rachel and she turns to her controlling husband David and her lover Will for help. Due to Rachel's lies and guilt she digs herself even more into trouble.To be honest I can't say I liked any of the characters in this book but then I don't know if the reader is supposed to. David is a controlling husband who uses everyone in his quest for power and money in the business world and even though I think Will does genuinely have deep feelings for Rachel I don't think he came across that well until towards the end of the book. As for Rachel, she is very much a troubled soul but then most of the time I don't think she helps herself. Towards the end though I did start to have more empathy for her.Even though in general I didn't like the characters I did enjoy The Liar's Chair. There are a couple of twists towards the end and the story line drew me in right from the very start.Anyone who likes dark, psychological thrillers will enjoy this book and I certainly look forward to reading more by this author."}, {"userName": "A.E.

Rachel, the main character, from the outset, is a rich, selfish alcoholic who kills someone by accident and then covers it up. Her husband David is more than a little controlling. His behaviour is so extreme that we begin to feel for Rachel, in spite of how unappealing she is. And we do gradually discover there are reasons in her background that explain why she turned out the way she did. Their business partners are similarly repellent. Her secret lover is a violent drug dealer. Even the dogs have little to recommend them. It's a bleak modern fairytale of a thriller though, and impossible to put down. The need to know what happens next is compelling, and the gradual revelations about Rachel's background and how she does try to put things right for the daughter of the man she killed goes some long way towards redeeming her - which initially seems unlikely. Her husband is the real villain and my only disappointment is that there isn't a grand revenge at the end, just the hope that it will catch up with him eventually. By that point I would have liked an over-the-top climax, but that was the subtle part of the story.... A very good debut."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2304102-stephanie", "userReview": "Oh boy. You know those books where you hate pretty much all of the characters? The Liar's Chair is one of those. I absolutely detested the two main characters, Rachel and David who have the most toxic marriage ever. They're both selfish, cruel (to each other and everyone else) and just generally people that I would never want to find myself around for even a moment. I even hated David's dogs who, though they're just background to the story, are just as bad as their master. Despite my hatred of everyone in the book, I actually enjoyed reading The Liar's Chair. Whitney's writing is crisp and easy to read while packing a punch. While I didn't care what happened to the characters, I did feel invested in the story and wanted to see how all of the different storylines, from Rachel's hit and run to David's horrific and abusive nature, were going to play out.After finishing this book, I wasn't 100% sure how I felt about the ending. The Liar's Chair is well written but the last few pages were a letdown for me. I don't want to go into detail (and ruin the book) so I'll just say it wasn't a very satisfying conclusion and I almost feel like it was wrapped up a bit too quickly.Thank you to the publishers for providing a copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Tracey Walsh", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16051498-tracey-walsh", "userReview": "It's rare to read a book where none of the characters is likeable but this is definitely one.\"Rachel Teller and her husband David appear happy, prosperous and fulfilled.

The main character Rachel is surviving in her dysfunctional world. Others have expressed that they do not like her character but I have to disagree. I love the way the story unfolds to reveal how Rachel became Rachel. Her parents were selfish and self involved to the extreme so that Rachel never knew how to receive love and affection or how to go about making a good decision in life. She was like a small dingy tossed by huge waves beyond her control. Through all of this chaos and mess she emerges strong, shows courage and is able to finally make sense of it all on her very lonely road to redemption.

From the first chapter where it was disjointed and assumed some sort of implicit knowledge from the reader, I felt that we were on the back foot straight away with what was going on. There was a few relationships that weren't adequately described in order to support the progression of the story, and there were plenty of strange uncomfortable story arcs that didn't really make a lot of sense to me.

The Liar's Chair was not what I thought it was going to be and so I felt a little bit let down by it, even though it wasn't necessarily bad. I think I had anticipated another fast-paced thriller full of twists and turns but that isn't what it is. What I can say about The Liar's Chair is that it is definitely a character-driven novel, with some of the most interesting and despicable characters I have come across in a long time. Actually the most difficult thing about this book is the fact that both the main characters are awful and you really can't side with one over the other a lot of the time. I suppose that it's quite similar to Gone Girl in that respect. Sometimes I could understand why David was being such a manipulative asshole and that makes me feel guilty. I do not condone his behaviour in any way and I certainly do not agree with any kind of domestic abuse, whether physical or emotional. It's just that when Rachel was off sleeping with whoever and being a complete skank I could appreciate why he might feel the need to question her repeatedly and get angry. It made me uncomfortable to be put in the position where I occasionally felt like I could relate to an abusive husband or a cheating wife. The ending was a bit strange and not quite what I was expecting. I think with this sort of book I am usually anticipating a big twist of some kind or at least a bit of action but I kind of felt like this one just fizzled out. It wasn't very satisfying and it was frustrating that I didn't feel like everything had been resolved. I feel like the synopsis of this book paints it as something that it isn't. I'd definitely say it was less thriller than I was expecting and more of a slow-paced look at the workings of an abusive relationship and a woman with many unresolved issues. Don't go into this expecting to be on the edge of your seat with excitement because it just isn't that kind of book.It wasn't all disappointing though. I thought the story was interesting and the character development was good overall, even if the ending fell a little flat. I can see what the author was intending and it makes sense and is perhaps quite realistic for the situation compared to a lot of similar books that romanticise things too much. I really hated pretty much every single character in it but they were all so well-written that they felt real and I would have happily punched them all in the face given half a chance. The whole book actually felt very real and Rebecca Whitney deserves credit for writing a story that felt like it could be happening to my next door neighbour. It will definitely make you think and consider what is normal and healthy in a relationship. I am so torn about how to rate this book because on one hand it was very clever and interesting but on the other hand it wasn't enough.Really, I shouldn't have read The Liar's Chair so soon after finishing The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. I really enjoyed that book and, whilst it wasn't perfect, it was quite a tough act to follow. It didn't help that both protagonists are called Rachel. I think The Liar's Chair is good but it didn't blow me away. It doesn't have the pace and the excitement of other psychological thrillers I have read and I think it needed something more to really stand out in the post-Gone Girl market. That said, it was still a very interesting read and, like I said, the characters in particular were very well developed. I would probably pick up another book by Rebecca Whitney in the future."}, {"userName": "Melissa Snow", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58586986-melissa-snow", "userReview": "I have very mixed feelings about this book. I absolutely loved the beginning and thought it started really strongly. I felt that it got pretty muddled in the middle and events moved away from the Tellers' marriage - which is what I was definitely most intrigued and interested in. None of the characters in this are likeable, and I didn't feel able to relate to the protagonist much at all. I liked the flashbacks to Rachel's past, but felt that these weren't as developed as they could have been.

It can spur exploration, invention, and new discoveries. But if \u201cwhat if\u201d is a stand-in for \u201cif only\" then it can become one of the most destructive questions a person can ask themselves, as it is often laced with guilt and regret. And in Rachel Teller\u2019s case it seems as if her \u201cif only\u201d causes her entire life to unravel, but Rebecca Whitney\u2019s debut The Liar's Chair shows that even if you live in a house made mostly from glass, what goes on inside can be largely hidden\u00a0and that Rachel\u2019s life hangs together from \u201cif only\u201dsWhile The Liar\u2019s Chair\u2019s plot was gripping, the book was very much a character study\u00a0of how a person could end up in Rachel\u2019s situation. Rachel is a sympathetic main character, but for me it was a sympathy laced with pity, but also outrage and exasperation, because she does some awful things. What fascinated me the most was how someone who is evidently talented and competent at her job, creating a very\u00a0successful\u00a0business, can be so totally dominated and broken down by her significant other. Why would she allow him to treat her this way? Is there an underlying pathology or traumatic event in her past? Whitney reveals this beautifully. It\u2019s at times painful to see what causes Rachel\u2019s belief that she merits no better treatment and it made me angry too.\u00a0There were so many points in Rachel\u2019s life that could have been a \u201cwhat if\u201d moment and there were so many people who failed her, including Rachel herself.Rachel is mostly surrounded by male characters; the women we encounter are mostly in the background or seemingly stuck in similarly unpleasant marriages. The only other significant female character is Rachel\u2019s mum, who we mostly encounter in Rachel\u2019s memories, and who doesn\u2019t come off to well in her role as a parent. The three most important men in Rachel\u2019s life are her husband David, her lover\u00a0Will, and David\u2019s business partner Alex. David pushed all of my buttons; he\u2019s an awful man, who unfortunately, as is so often the case with abusers, comes of as charming\u00a0to the outside world.Early on, Whitney includes some great clues to his true nature, specifically through his treatment of his two dogs, the way he alternately cherishes them and ignores them and plays favourites with them, which is a cruel thing to do. Will was a far more likeable character, though he\u2019s no snowflake; he\u2019s a dealer and small-time criminal.\u00a0Yet he has a kind heart as shown through his treatment of his little, old dog, who is cherished and pampered. Whitney utilises the treatment of animals, and dogs in particular, as a way to telegraph a person\u2019s true nature, because there are several other characters who\u2019s treatment of animals is commented upon.Whitney\u2019s writing is great. Her pacing creates a tense narrative, which consistently torques up the tension\u00a0and increasing the speed at which Rachel\u2019s life unravels. The ending was spectacular and I liked how Whitney slowed the story back down in the final pages, creating a satisfying ending. The Liar\u2019s Chair is a great debut and if you enjoy a psychological thrillers in the vein of Gone Girl or The Life I\u00a0Left Behind, then you should certainly give this one a try.This book was provided for review by the publisher."}], "description": "The truth could destroy her ...
