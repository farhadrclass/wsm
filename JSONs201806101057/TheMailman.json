The Mailman was something, I wish I could read this again fresh without any prior recollection but it\u2019s great to have this in my book memory library, put away to smile at when I remember reading it. In a place isolated and small enough a lunatic mailman can do actual damage, in this book the concept takes that plunge and manages to make the most ridiculous things realistic enough where I would take a pause thinking, well this COULD happen\u2026 and then ick.. how would I react in that case\u2026 For the residents of a small Arizona town the news of their mailman committing suicide was a shock, the only worst thing that happened was his replacement, materialized out of what seemed like plain air the new mailman barely resembles a living creature as his robotic and cold mannerism unnerves more than one resident, one family in particular feels that he\u2019s picking on them, when things are so bizarre that one tires to convince himself that what is happening could not possibly be real the price for lack of faith is high.. the mailman is an enigmatic character that the reader isn\u2019t sure about, is he real or is he part of something supernatural and sinister going on or is everyone\u2019s imagination simply acting up after the funeral? Deaths, warnings, violence, strange bizzaro behavior.. it\u2019s all here deliver right on time with the morning mail, or if you\u2019re unlucky enough at 3am\u2026I loved the creep factor climbing up my neck because the whole time I felt like something was wrong, that people weren\u2019t imagining their lives being disrupted by something as simple as a mailman, who has never seemed menacing until he appeared in this story. The ending was pretty good even though I would have loved more of a punch but the whole story was great, I had a blast reading it.

A quick, smart, and surprisingly bleak horror tale about a small town under siege, The Mailman is one of the finer horror stories I've read lately. The premise is a simple one: our main characters are Doug, a schoolteacher on summer vacation; his wife, Tritia; and their son, Billy. Peripheral characters are their friends and neighbors, but the focus is on this family \u2014 especially Doug . . . and, of course, the titular mailman, a newcomer to town. This one was published in 1991, and certainly shows its age: characters actually receive letters from relatives (*gasp*!) and totally rely on landlines. Yeah, this one is dated, but that adds to the charm. And despite feeling very early '90s, this story still has relevance today. Being a habitual online shopper, I check the mail religiously and have struck up a sort of friendship with my mail-woman. The mail is a big part of my life, so this novel's magic really worked on me. Little makes something so mundane as mail delivery terrifying! I enjoyed this one to pieces, and I cannot wait to read Little's other novels. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a fun and exceptionally scary summer read."}, {"userName": "Evans Light", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7008067-evans-light", "userReview": "A remarkably affable whack job of a horror novel.

Something we often take for granted in today's digitized, electronic society, in which the daily mail is merely one of many ways to communicate, pay bills, arrange clandestine trysts, express sadness or remorse or comfort to loved ones and friends. Today, a person could conceivably cut the daily mail out of their lives entirely, preferring to communicate largely by email, or pay their bills via phone or the Internet.But what about a mere twenty-years ago? A lifetime for those of the youngest generation, but for most of us, a time easily remembered when the mail was perhaps the biggest event of the day. Especially in small towns, when the mailman was a familiar, comforting cornerstone of small town life.So imagine a small town in Arizona. Where the mail has been co-opted by an outsider, a strange-looking man with pale skin, a sick smile, and an eerie knowledge of everyone's fears and secrets. Imagine how the mail changes, as townspeople receive strange letters from distant relatives and friends either long since passed from their lives...or long since dead, for that matter. Imagine the threads of paranoia weaving through an isolated town cut-off from the outside world, as the mail itself seems to become a living, breathing, sentient thing.Knowing everyone's secrets. Pushing their buttons, turning neighbors against each other. While the new mailman sits in a slowly deteriorating post office, like a spider in its web, playing everyone like personal chess pieces, moving them here and there, back and forth...with the daily mail.Bentley Little's The Mailman, reprinted in a deluxe, 20th Anniversary Edition by Cemetery Dance, is the best kind of horror: something comforting and familiar, twisted into a dark, shadowed version of itself. On the outset, the concept may seem a little ridiculous - that an evil mailman could slowly corrupt and take over a town - but it works splendidly, because it plucks an age-old chord: that evil is usually invited. Usually welcomed and allowed to grow strong. And in this novel, reading a letter is more than just enjoying correspondence: it's invitation. Acceptance. And once something dark and twisted is allowed entrance into our lives, it burrows and digs deep, refusing to let go without dreadful consequence."}, {"userName": "Angel Gelique", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13230091-angel-gelique", "userReview": "I love Bentley Little novels and this one is no exception. It was creepy and eerie and a bit suspenseful..everything a good horror novel should be. The plot was a stretch--but it's fiction after all, so a supernatural mailman is perfectly okay!

Little took an every day innocuous mindless really act of receiving mail to a very horrifying level. That's pretty awesome to me, turning mundane into frightening. Apparently Philly's post offices (with exception of the very excellent Q.V. one) are nothing comparing to the horrors of postal situation in a small town Arizona, where for one summer going to the mailbox has become a very dangerous proposition. Good writing and pacing, very quick and entertaining read.

Take a common place or occupation. 2. Make it evil. Places that have already been used: The Night School (\"University\"), The Town, The Store, The House, The Association, The Resort, The Academy, etc.Professions that have already been used: The Mailman, The Consultant, The Policy (insurance company), Dispatch (letter writer), etc.Here's my idea for my Bentley Little inspired novel: The Garbageman! It's about an evil garbageman who takes peoples garbage and then insidiously starts scattering it all over neighborhoods and streets. The Garbageman kills all the other fellow garbagemen, but there is no evidence to prove that he committed such homicidal or littering crimes. He basically just harasses people for over 300 pages until the book comes to an abrupt end. And of course, like any Bentley Little novel, it would be incomplete without the inclusion of an unnecessary passage deliberating on a character's penis (or as Little likes to call it, \"rod\"). So we include a Chapter in which The Garbageman picks up peoples garbage without pants and with an erection. The story is eventually solved by everyone no longer throwing out trash, they instead recycle! And with this, The Garbageman's garbage spirit withers and dies.

I really hated the main characters: Doug The Man of Impotent Rage and Trish the Shrew. 2. NOTHING happens in this book. It is empty. It is just a bunch of moving images. 3. This book requires a complete suspension of disbelief, wherein Disbelief is shot, stabbed, and placed into a trunk of a car which is then set on fire and sent over a cliff into a pit that is then filled with cement that is used as a foundation for a home for lepers. In return for abandoning all you know about how people act and communicate in the real world, you get NOTHING. A big heaping, fly-ridden NOTHINGBURGER. Enjoy your NOTHING.4. OK, SPOILERISH--the crazy baddie is basically just as impotent as Doug. The absolute worst thing the Mailman did in the entire book was get me to read it. And even then, I could have just closed the book. so I'm worse than the Mailman.5. Little writes like he is a slave to tedium. 6. I hate this book. 7. I will never read anything else by Little. So this was strike three for me with Little. I read THE CIRCLE and tried to read THE RETURN and I cannot understand how anyone can be a Bentley Little fan. Sorry if you are. This of course isn't a judgment on you. I'm sure you are a wonderful person in every way, and we can talk about our love of reading and ice cream, but we can never ever agree on anything worthwhile about Bentley Little's books.

When I stumbled upon Bentley Little's strange and twisted talent many years ago, I felt like jumping for joy - here was a fantastic writer with quite a talent for embracing the strange, creepy, and downright terrifying in a way that makes you wanting more.The first day of summer is always enjoyable for both children and adults alike...and in a small town in Arizona, this is no different. However, a horrible tragedy strikes, leaving the town without a mailman - until the new one shows up. A bit strange in appearance and personality, the residents of the town don't think much of it - until odd things begin happening. First, the people in the town begin getting letters from people they haven't heard from in years. Then mail begins getting mixed up - and letters with some not-so-nice contents end up causing arguments among the recipients. Bills stop being delivered - and this results in power, water, and phone lines being shut off. Finally, some of the residents of the town notice some very strange things being sent to them via the mail...and they have had some bizarre interactions with the mailman that will make you want to leave the lights on if you're reading this book before bedtime. The plot of The Mailman seems kind of simple, but there is so much going on in this book that there isn't a single moment of boredom. The pacing is pretty fast, and it's one of those books where you will keep saying \"Just one more chapter!\" and find yourself still awake at four in the morning reading. It's just so easy to become absorbed in this nail-biting, truly chillingI have read this book so many times...at least seven or eight now, and it never gets old. I'm pretty sure the first time I read this I was like ten or eleven (and had probably read a great deal of the books already on my mom's bookshelf), so of course, as I got older, I had to own a copy of it for myself (I have the paperback and Kindle versions of it). For a while, this book was kind of tough to track down. It was originally published in 1991 by Signet, but had been out of print for a while before Cemetery Dance Publications picked it up again. I have the original version, of course, but the newer version has a nice, spruced up cover that looks pretty nice. It's pretty cheap on Kindle, too...so if you're reluctant to try out his writing, that's a great way to give this fantastic author a chance!Bentley Little is truly a master of horror. He knows how to write deliciously terrifying stories that would make other writers cringe at the mere thought of. Out of all of the Bentley Little books I've read over the years (and there are a lot), The Mailman remains a personal favorite (as well as The Association and The Store - check those out, too). Just keep in mind that this isn't YA horror in the slightest...and it isn't for those with a weak stomach, either.Sure, it deals with some twisted content (actually, some downright messed up stuff), but if you aren't one for minding this type of writing, and you like horror, than this is one that you absolutely need on your shelf."}, {"userName": "Robb Bridson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10357507-robb-bridson", "userReview": "It contains all the elements of other Bentley Little books I've read: a mundane situation gone wrong and taken to absurd levels; a weird, supernatural being with no explanation; really sick, twisted, and disturbing results that keep it from just being silly satire...For some reason, I just didn't like this one as much as the others I've read.Maybe part of it is that it was written in the last days before the Internet took over everything, and so the underlying premise doesn't hold up as well as if it were a Littlesque take on social networking. Without the connection to the horror of the real-life institution, there's nothing to make the villain scary. Even when there's a gas shortage used as the way to keep people in the town, I find myself wondering why they couldn't leave with half a tank of gas. How far apart are towns in Arizona?For whatever reason-- maybe because it was an earlier work, maybe because the subject idn't connect with me-- the mailman is more like a gimmick villain from a B-movie than a living personification of institutional evil. The mystery seemed drawn out, like it should have been a short story.But it was still pretty fun to read, and another window into Little's bizarre mind."}, {"userName": "Phillip Smith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51996723-phillip-smith", "userReview": "A strong 4 stars.

This was the sixth book I read. The Association and The Colection are two of my favourite horror books.Well, if you read any of his books this one follows that thread. Bently Little uses a thing/person of everday and turns it into a evil thing. The association was one of those things. Who could thing a house association could be so evil.All his ideas, the ones I read, are far different from other horror writers. And that's what so interesting about him. I think in a way he is gem. An hidden gem for that matter.As you read this novel about this mailman you understand that this is fiction personage but it could happen. Well Maybe. It's realistic enough.The story begins with the arrival of a new mailman because the last one has commited suicide to the disbelief of everyone. The new mailman (until the very end) you can't understand what he is. I think that's the best part of the novel. From the beginning to the end is an enigmatic character that make you think if he is real or supernatural. From the first moment on he begins to torment all residents, first with only good things on the mail changing to only bad mails at odd hours and other things... As you turn the pages the creeping sensation on your neck begins to rise until the climax at the final confrontation.The main character and it's family are quite good characters each with it's problems with the mailman and themselves.
