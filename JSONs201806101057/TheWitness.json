I viewed myself as way hipper or cooler than Nora Roberts... but now that I've actually TRIED her stuff, I'll admit that I was dead wrong. Nora Roberts can write her ass off.This book is for fans of quirky, independent women. It is for us geeks and smarties, for fans of sex-positive female characters. It is for lovers of romantic suspense that isn't overly dramatic. Frankly, it was flat-out awesome. I'm going to touch on the narrator for a moment. Julia Whelan is a prolific and well known narrator for a reason; she is simply amazing at her craft. Her range of voices, her ability to do a realistic male voice, her performance skills- they were all perfection. It made the 16+ hours fly by, and I listened to the whole thing in just a couple of days. The narration made an already stellar story come to life.If you like Nora Roberts or you like romantic suspense, you must try this book. But if you are like me and are not well acquainted with either, you STILL MUST TRY THIS BOOK! This is a must read for romance-lovers, especially audiobook lovers."}, {"userName": "Sal", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14856434-sal", "userReview": "Don't get me wrong. This book is great. But it could have been so much more.Though I haven't read any other books by Nora Roberts, I know she's a romance writer, not crime, or thriller, but I couldn't help wishing this book was a crime/thriller. The set-up to the main plot was really really good, fascinating, but then the rest of the book never reaches that level again. To be honest, I'm a bit mean giving this two stars, but on a comparative level to the books I would give three stars, it falls a little bit flat.I was reading, reading, reading and when I finished, all I thought was, that's it? So many characters that weren't developed yet (the bad guys) and she didn't extend the plot any further, instead she just concentrated on the romance part. Which is understandable, because that's the genre she writes, but it left me feeling empty. This had the potential to be the new 'Girl With The Dragon Tattoo'! The main character has a photographic memory, she has a ridiculous IQ, she's socially inept, say hello to interesting character who is crying out for a more character development and a more intense plot! Now USE her! Actually to be honest, her character was a little unrealistic when she was young, and I found it a little hard to warm to her. When she grew up, her talents and a little of her personality struck a resemblance to Lisbeth Salander (not as hardcore, of course), but I'm not complaining, because that's one of my favourite heroines ever.I'm going on and on and making this book appear to be a bad book, but it isn't. Honestly, it's good. But I feel frustrated at the potential this book has, and this potential was never reached. Instead, it was like this: Terrific set up, intriguing characters, romance, romance, romance, everything solved within ten pages, the end, boom.Sigh."}, {"userName": "Shawna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802746-shawna", "userReview": "[The part where she methodically researched proper etiquette and social customs of a barbecue on the Internet just to prepare for a casual gathering with Brooks\u2019s family cracked me up.

I'm a big fan of Nora Roberts but I'm not sure why people gave this book such rave reviews. This book started out with a bang. Elizabeth is a 16 year old genius rebelling against her cold,controlling mother. She meets up with a Russian mafia don and witnesses the brutal murder of a mafia henchman and her teenaged female friend. She ends up on the run for her life. Twelve years later, she moves to a small town and meets and falls in love with the local sheriff, Brooks. Elizabeth's character comes across as the stereotypical genius who would never, in a million years, be able to blend in in any gathering that didn't involve Mensa members. Her speech is stilted and stiff. She is a recluse who somehow thought that her antisocial ways would not be noticed in a small, rural community. Her love interest, Brooks, comes across as a paragon of virtues. He's too good to be true and as boring as can be. There's no edge there, no feeling of passion or drive. After they meet, the majority of the book revolves around their relationship and Elizabeth's caution and security interests; the alarms that alert her when intruders(or visitors) come on her property, her possession of numerous handguns, the loyal and well trained guard dog. In addition, pages cover her hacking into FBI and mafia computers and using those tools to damage the mafia. To make it even duller, they deal with towns people and their issues. I kept expecting something to happen. I kept waiting for the mafia to discover where she was and come in with guns blazing. That never happened. Instead, the bad guys were taken down without any kind of fight and then the book was over. To me, this book just fizzled. It was boring and bland. There was no suspense, no drama, no passion. The characters were stereotypical and as flat as the storyline."}, {"userName": "Ingela", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15589375-ingela", "userReview": "Written July 17, 20154 1/2 Stars - Fantastic listening and a good well told thrilling plot. I'm to be honest surprised, but this NR romance impressed me...muchI bought this Nora Roberts as an 16:18 hrs audiobook (narrated by Julia Whelan) already back in March. I honestly thought I was finished and done with NB-books several years ago, but never say never. The Witness (from 2012) has got so many happy reviews, and was much appreciated by both Kathleen and Heather as an audiobook. Convinced by friends, I wanted to give The Wittness and a NB novel a \"second\" chance. It's was time. \nWow! Sixteen highly entertaining listening hoursThe Wittness was from the very first chapter nerve-tingling and breathlessly exciting. I was at once on my edge. This pretty clever storyplot \u2014mainly about fear, revenge, cruelty... but also about to fit in, be a \"normal\" girl, be loved and to sincerely trust someone once again\u2014 really got me. An EXTRA STAR for a fantastic audiobook narration. I'm not sure this should had been such a winner for me just reading by myself. **********************************************Chicago some years ago...Elizabeth Fitch is a sixteen years old super intelligent girl with a very controlling mother who let loose one (..ONE single) night. A night that change her life for ever. Two cruel murders, one of her new friend. Guilty men, Russian ancestors that all belongs to the mob in Chicago. From that night is Elizabeth a hunted victim.... she is the witness. \n\u201cLove doesn\u2019t turn on and off like a light switch.\u201d \nIn a small Arkansas town...Years later is there a police chief, Brooks Gleason who is intrigued by Abigail Lowery, the mysterious woman living outside town since a while. He just feel and strongly suspects that this \"armed\" woman, with a huge scary dog, needs protection from something. Our hero Brooks is a man who likes to protect. He takes good care of his citizens and he like to solve tricky puzzles. Especially when there is an beautiful woman to get to know. **********************************************Learning to live a \"real\" life...This poor teen girl. Yes, it was a traumatic start. I just wished her a better life. Elizabeth's mom was a egocentric bitch (in the right word and meaning) without any ability to feel feelings for, or want to take tender care of, of her own young daughter. The first part with teenage Elizabeth isn't that long and the main storyline starts the day Abigail meets Brooks. What a funny heroine we get here. This very intelligent and kind of geeky woman was just so adorable charming when she discovered feelings, the \"love-play\" and relationships stuff... ~ Chuckling fun. I allways enjoy to read about a bit cheesy (nerd) characters. A female character who almost talks like a living encyclopedia (must be some combination of \"letters\"..). Like this heroine. So likeable and charming. \n\u201cStudies show adolescent males often make decisions based on sex. Many fail to grow out of it.\u201d \u201cAfter weighing the pros and cons, I\u2019ve decided sex with you would be mutually satisfying. You\u2019re attractive and pleasant. And clean. You kiss very well, and while I\u2019ve found that\u2019s not always a reliable gauge for skill in bed, it often follows. If you\u2019re agreeable, we can finish dinner, I\u2019ll show you the greenhouse, then we can go in and have sex. I\u2019m on birth control, but I would require you wear a condom.\u201d \n...and this wonderful M.A.N. !!This gorgeous man. ~ A dream hero with an upbringing in a big warm caring hippie family. A friendly, but righteous policeman who moved back to his small hometown when his father was getting older and a bit sick, and when his mother \u2014and (married) sisters\u2014 needed him for nearer support. The kind of man most women wish for. You know the kind: big & strong, wise, tender, funny, charming, loyal and faithful, and cozy kissable sexy. Drool-worthy!I also mostly like novels or romances set in small nice places or towns. Stories including tales about local people, about sweet old ladies, nice old friends, a odd secretary, a lovely mom, some adorable cute dogs (like Big Bert and Sunny's new puppy - a gift from her thoughtful son), etc etc. I like suspense stories with a lot of romance feeling there...and some steamy hot moments. ~ I actually got it all here. (Some small dance moves..)\n\u2018She was happy, she realized, as she marked off her plot with string and stakes. Really happy. With spring, with work, with her home. With Brooks. Had she been really happy before? Surely there had been moments...\u2019\nDid our heroine get her revenge, was there a pretty clever solution? ~ Read or listen and discover. **********************************************Julia Whelan (narrator) does it so amazing well.She just swept me away with a nail biting thrilling suspense romance (..a genre perfect for me this summer vacation week). Quite long book but well worth the time.Recommended to you who also \"left\" Ms. Roberts to other readers (those with lesser \"good\" taste in their book choices, haha) years ago. ~ I crawl to the cross, it may be more NR soon.I LIKE - surprising good (audio) stories extremely well narrated****I gifted the translated (yes there really are some romances in Swedish sometimes) paperback to my older (71) mom last xmas.

The author that you know no matter what mood you were in, her books would be just right. But for some unexplainable reason, I have not read one of her books in such a long time. So when I received The Witness as a gift from my wonderful friend, I dove right in. And, as sure as the sun rises in the East, the book was perfect in every way. First, I want to introduce you to Elizabeth Fitch. She is the sixteen year old daughter of Dr. Susan L. Fitch. Elizabeth was conceived through IVF, the donor carefully chosen for the ultimate intellect, looks and health. This fact was clearly stated to Elizabeth, time and time again. Her mother is emotionless and controlling. She guides every aspect of Elizabeth\u2019s life, her education, clothes, nutrition, daily activities. Elizabeth is technically a genius with a photographic memory. At sixteen, she is in Harvard and her mother has her set to begin medical school. This is not what Elizabeth wants, though. But she has never disobeyed her mother, until THAT night.Elizabeth and her mother have argued for the first time. After Dr. Fitch leaves for a medical convention, Elizabeth goes to a mall for the first time, shops, and runs into a girl she once knew in school. They come up with a plan for a crazy night out, using false ID\u2019s, going to a club and hoping to meet cute guys. But, this night does not turn out the way it was supposed to. Elizabeth is a witness to a horrible crime. She is taken into protective custody but through another equally horrible set of circumstances, she is forced to run on her own.\nFast forward twelve years. Elizabeth has become Abigail Lowery. She is living in a small town in the Ozarks. She has found a place she loves. A place she would like to call home. But she knows she can\u2019t stay. Still, though, she has put down roots here. She has planted a butterfly garden and vegetable garden. She keeps to herself. She\u2019s known as a loner. But there is one person that would like to break through that protective shell and see who is underneath.\nBrooks Gleason is the town Chief of Police. And he is intrigued by Abigail. He keeps showing up at her house unannounced and breaking down her defenses. Eventually Abigail does give in, knowing that this is something that can\u2019t last. But she has never experienced romance, love. Never dated. She has so much trouble expressing herself but the things she says are just so completely endearing. Her awkwardness and naivety make her adorable. I loved Brooks and Abigail together. They were exactly what each other needed. But, Brooks knows Abigail is hiding something. He wants her to trust him enough to let him in. And can Abigail dare to dream of a future with Brooks, in this lovely town? Does she have the courage to finally face her past and put it to rest?\n\"I'm half in love with you and heading fast toward three-quarters.\"\nI loved this book so much. No one can write suspense and romance together like Nora Roberts. You will fall in love with Elizabeth/Abigail and Brooks. And also with Brook\u2019s family. This book will make you sigh, smile and also grip the arms of your chair a little tighter. It was simply a wonderful book. I hope you\u2019ll give it a try. \n\"To be held like this on a cool spring night by someone who cared. It was like a miracle, even for someone who didn't believe in them.\""}, {"userName": "Dorsey aka \u2764\ufe0f Wrath Lover Reviews  \u2764\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5205999-dorsey-aka-wrath-lover-reviews", "userReview": "I loved this book!

Being a huge fan of her In Death series, which she writes under the pseudonym of J D Robb, I wanted to give her other books a try. I found myself totally absorbed in this compelling and intriguing novel. From the exciting beginning, when Liz becomes a witness to a brutal crime, to her transformation into Abigail, loner and security expert, I was drawn to her character and circumstances. The town where she settles is full of interesting characters that added depth and emotion to the story. She is pursued by the easygoing, relentless police chief Brooks Gleason. He annoys her, but at the same time he unearths feelings in her that she never thought possible. Theirs is a relationship that forms slowly, as Brooks gains Abigail\u2019s trust, then worms and finagles his way into her life. These interactions made for some very humorous moments, as Abigail is almost robotic in personality and Brooks is smooth and charming. The dialogue between the two of them is fantastic and plentiful. The romance that develops is sweet, and at times heated. I found it to be the perfect balance. There is also a secondary storyline that briefly involves Abigail, but Brooks and some of the townspeople are the main focus. The two plots intertwined quite nicely. In my mind I had predicted how the story would end, but the author surprised me with an unexpected twist. It was fitting. There was one other character who played a major role in the book and I feel is worth a mention, Abigail\u2019s dog Bert. He was as much a part of the story as Brooks and Abigail, and I found myself looking forward to the parts of the book where he was present. My only issue came in the way of the epilogue. When I read an epilogue, I expect and look forward to an update of the characters and what has become of them and their lives. This epilogue served as just another chapter in the book, updated only hours from the exciting ending. With the turmoil that plagued Abigail\u2019s life, I had hoped to see what the future held for her and Brooks, and I was somewhat disappointed. However I highly recommend this book, not only for fans of Nora Roberts, but for lovers of romantic suspense. Narration-5 Stars!I\u2019ve just recently discovered the wonderful world of audio books, but from the few I\u2019ve listened too, I find that some are books are best to be read from the written word, while others can be just as enjoyable, or even more so, when someone reads them to you. The Witness is one of those books. Julia Whelan\u2019s smooth steady narration had me mesmerized, and fully captured my attention.

It was a nice change. I have no problem reading about a group of friends or relatives in a trilogy, but it was nice to know that everyone I met in the book existed solely to enrich this book.One thing I love about this author is the way she sets up the backstory. If you\u2019re familiar with her work then you probably already know that she likes to cut her books into sections (or Acts) to show the progression of the characters\u2019 journey, but if not\u2026well, now you know. :) The first section (the first 100 pages or so) of The Witness showed the heroine\u2019s past. I got so much more involved in the events than if I had just been told about what happened to her back then. I loved seeing all the details for myself and found that getting to know the heroine in the past made it easier for me to get over some of the issues I had with her character later. I know that sometimes too much focus on the past can detract from the present, but I have always loved this habit of NR\u2019s and have never found that to be the case.I found the whole storyline to be unique and different. The heroine witnessed a crime when she was a teenager and was forced to change her identity because of it. Can you imagine having to change everything about yourself? Her family (no big loss honestly), her future plans, they were all wiped out like they were nothing. I really liked getting to see how she coped with the past and lived her life as an adult. It also added an interesting layer to the romance. Your whole life is a lie. How close do you get to someone when you factor that in? Do you tell your love interest the truth and risk exposing yourself? I liked that what kept them apart felt real. It wasn\u2019t just some simple, manufactured reason, blown up to epic proportion to provide drama.I think that the heroine, Abigail (originally Elizabeth), was a great character, but she occasionally veered toward the cold end of things. I think she was supposed to be similar to Miranda from Homeport (Anyone read it? Great book!), given that they both processed things scientifically and logically and they were both rather socially awkward, but Miranda had a vulnerability to her that Abigail lacked. That lack of softness occasionally made it hard to connect with her. We knew she was scared due to the way she lived and her refusal to let people into her life, but I never really felt it from her. That\u2019s one of the reasons that having that section of backstory really helped for me. I did feel the emotion and fear in the beginning, so I had that to draw on. I just think that in addition to the emotionless way she was raised, being on the run for so long removed her from the world so effectively that it was hard for even the reader to get close to her. I\u2019m not sure if she was cast this way by design, but it kept me from fully sinking into her character and the relationship. That said, it didn\u2019t keep me from enjoying the rest of the book.Brooks, the hero, is not delved into as deeply as Abigail was, but he was much easier to love. He\u2019s amusing and charming and he does a wonderful job of loosening Abigail up. I thought it was cute that we first met him when he was sitting in the town\u2019s caf\u00e9, positioned specifically to be able to see Abigail on the off chance that she would come to town to shop that day. He was interested in her, both as a cop and as a man, and he finally decided to take a chance and go chat her up, despite her \u2018Leave me alone\u2019 vibe. He was shot down, and he was shot down hard, but I\u2019ve got to give him props for determination. He just kept bugging her, trying to charm her, until he eventually grew on her. Like mold. :P The small town was charming, but kept away from the hokey, cheesy characterization that always drives me nuts. Brooks had a lot more ties to the community than Abigail did, so we were given a better picture of the inhabitants when we were in his point of view. His family was fun to read about, especially his mom, and it was nice to see a lot of his job instead of just focusing on the suspense plot surrounding the heroine. One thing that I found odd about the story, but that I liked more and more upon further reflection, was the suspense plot. Truthfully, it wasn\u2019t very suspenseful. The heroine had her life turned upside down by a murder, yes, but there was no menacing presence breathing down her neck like you usually see in an RS. She changed her identity and was very prepared for possible discovery, but that was all a background feature. When the end resolution came, we were told about it more than it was shown. At first that bothered me because I wanted a seat at the front lines, you know? But the more I thought about it the more I realized that the book wasn\u2019t set up to play out like the usual Suspense story. She played her part and she moved on. She didn\u2019t need be a witness for it to be over for her. If you\u2019re looking for an RS that\u2019s heavy on the suspense, this isn\u2019t that book. Just an FYI for you.

Elizabeth rebels against her robot Mom (she's not really a robot, but the lady doesn't hug, wear color, or do anything without a schedule) when she's sixteen. That's what teenagers do, and even though Liz is a bit of a mini-robot, she's still a teenager girl who wants to live her own life, not the one her 'mother' picks for her. This one decision leads to the witnessing of a horrible crime committed by a crime family with far-reaching influence. So Liz has to rely on her brilliant mind to hide herself from not only the bad guys, but the good guys as well. Fast forward over a decade, and Abigail Lowry is a practical hermit, living in self imposed solitude in her cabin near a small town in the middle of nowhere. She just wants to be left alone with her genius self, hiding from the world behind her ridiculously modern security system and faithful guard dog, Bert. (It IS Nora Roberts, you know there has to be a dog) Not only is she still in hiding, but she's so socially inept that just her oddity gets tongues wagging whenever she goes to the supermarket. Small towns are not a good place to hide, Abigail!!She quickly catches the eye of the local police chief, Brooks Gleason. Their relationship builds slowly, and what a sweet couple they turn out to be! Brooks is so patient with Abigail. He thinks her oddities are cute; in fact, I do believe her rigidity and need for order was a turn on for the sexy, laid back chief! Bert the dog was an endearing character in his own right, and just reiterates how the loyalty and love shown by our canine family members is one fabulous gift from God. Want unconditional love? Screw a boyfriend/husband. Get a dog!The suspense is offset by the love story between Brooks and Abigail and I just loved it! The only thing that I didn't love is the abrupt ending frequently mentioned by other reviewers.

In all honesty, I am not a huge fan of Nora Roberts' romance novels, although I do like her JD Robb In Death series. While this book didn't change my opinion of her on convert her to a must-read author for me, I enjoyed this book, and I can see she is a very good writer. Having said that, I don't find her romance style very moving personally. As far as suspense, she definitely works better for me. This novel feels like an odyssey. It starts with a very young, innocent teenage girl whose rigidly structured, emotionally vacant life is completely destroyed by one bad decision she makes out of rebellion. Nora Roberts invests us in the emotional and intellectual journey of this young woman, and I completely felt for and loved young Elizabeth. This was highly crucial to go back to when things went pear-shaped so that we could relate to the older version of this character, who is now living as Abigail Lowery.What didn't work quite as well as the diversion that the storyline takes with the Blake family and their out-of-control son. While this was more germane to Brooks Gleason's (Abigail's love interest) narrative, I don't think it really tied very well into the main plot of Abigail, what and who she was running from, and I'm not sure it was that important to Brooks' characterization. Even at the end, I wasn't convinced that it was necessary to the story. More than anything, it was just added local color. The romance part mostly worked for me, but it didn't set the page on fire. Roberts idea of romance just isn't dramatic enough for me. Even the sensual scenes didn't have much spark for me. I could see the love between Abigail and Brooks, and I really liked how Brooks was willing to be there for her and to be whatever she needed him to be. Although at the same time, Brooks could be quite obstinate and set in his ways kind of guy and forceful (in an aww-shucks, disarming but I'm a brickwall manner) about getting his way in situations. He was like a immovable mountain about some things, and Abigail had to be the one who changed her viewpoint in those areas. It was funny and kind of cute how he pushed Abigail out of her unemotional/controlled, Fortress of Solitude mien and left her completely discombobulated. I can see their marriage being very interesting, considering the way their personalities are so different. Where Abigail is the analytical, rule-oriented person, Brooks is very instinctive, and emotional. At the same time, he's a very steady guy who you know you can trust. That's highly appealing. I do feel like they were able to meet each other halfway and didn't steamroll each other, which was good. So I could believe they were a perfect match.Ultimately, what I loved most of all is how Brooks was perfectly fine with earning his way in Abigail's insular life by letting his actions show he was trustworthy and that deserved her love. He also didn't try to take away Abigail's need to make decisions and autonomy in her life, because he knew how important that was. Sometimes, I imagine it was hard for him not to take it personally, but he looked past his own feelings to the whys and was willing to give her that and support her on things she really needed. As for Abigail, I think loving Brooks helped her to grow in crucial ways. For her to know it was okay not to understand the rules for everything, and to just go with the flow emotionally in relationships that were based on mutual trust. I think the O'Hara/Gleason clan will be good for Abigail, but I think I would find them overwhelming at times. They are quite pushy! I can't imagine Abigail not feeling that way based on her previous familial frame of reference.The Volkov storyline was very intriguing, but I was left feeling a little disappointed at the conclusion. The resolution made sense, but I was hoping for a more face to face confrontation. I guess that's the action/drama hound in me. I guess that was the best way to handle it, but man I would have loved some buttkicking and a show off. Abigail was kind of a bad@$$, but she never got to show it. Oh well.Overall, this was a good read.Things I loved:*Such a brilliant, analytical, heroine *Brooks' laid back, but Bulldoggedly stubborn personality and his southern charm.*The descriptions and imagery built by Roberts writing.*Russian mafia storyline and how Abigail continually gets one over on them*Crazy O'Hara/Gleason family dynamics--like watching reality tv*Abigail's dog Bert*Small town slice of lifeWorth a 4.25/5.0 star rating.

I loved the first 25% where the young Elizabeth breaks free from her controlling mother and witnesses a murder.The next section shows her 12 years later, living a life in hiding. This is where the story fell apart for me.1. After 2-3 brief conversations, Elizabeth, a recluse who avoids all human contact, and Brooks, a police chief on duty, engage in bold banter about whether to have sex or not. I felt this was totally out of character and unrealistic.2. In the next scene, we get the clich\u00e9d Other Woman. The other woman is usually a beautiful blonde, and she is either a bitchy ex-wife, or a clinging ex-girlfriend who won't let go. In this case it's the clinging ex-girlfriend. I hate the beautiful blonde clich\u00e9. Being blond and beautiful does not make a woman evil.3. In the next few scenes, we have the hero rejecting the advances of the clinging ex. Then he goes off to the heroine and gives her a detailed rundown of his sexual history with the ex, including a description of how he turned her down - because he'd rather sleep with the heroine. To me, this is blatant kiss-and-tell. An honourable man does not belittle and humiliate one woman in order to seduce another. The hero is behaving like a sleazebag.4. The hero and heroine go to bed and have athletic sex. Here I'm totally lost about the heroine's character. She avoids all social contact, except a trip to a grocery store when necessary. She never lets anyone into her house, and she never goes out unarmed. And yet we are expected to believe that she likes to have sex and has done it with some frequency with strangers. Whoa? Would a woman afraid of any situation that makes her physically vulnerable just go off and have sex, a situation which makes a person more defenceless, less able to respond to a sudden attack, than almost any other circumstance?Further, it just does not make sense how Elizabeth keeps saying she wants to be normal. Yes, she has genius IQ and was brought up by a controlling mother, and she experienced a trauma and perceives herself under threat, but since seventeen she has been in charge of her life and if she really wanted to, she could live much more normally. Since seventeen, she has watched popular TV and movies. She went to college, which means she's had plenty of exposure to young people. She surfs the web, can visit chat rooms, learn how people talk. She is highly intelligent. She has the skills to blend in, to appear ordinary - which she claims to be her main objective - and yet she talks like a science textbook and lives in a way which is guaranteed to draw attention to her. Moreover, the minute she starts talking to someone, she tells them how extraordinary she is. It just does not make sense.That's what killed the book for me. The character of heroine is not credible at all.

She does something stupid (makes fake IDs and goes to a club) and disaster ensues. She witnesses a double murder by the Russian mob. Even though she is drunk and sick, she has a photographic memory so she can tell the cops everything that happened. She is placed in Witness Protection but the house is breached by bad cops and her protectors die. Elizabeth/Liz goes on the run for the next 12 years. She becomes a gun-toting reclusive computer security specialist and finally settles down in a small town in Arkansas. Police Chief Brooks Gleason starts sniffing around. At first he is merely curious about Abagail (Liz's new identity) but that quickly changes to something more. Abagail is not sure she wants a relationship but Brooks wins her over, but will she ever tell him her secret?I really wish NR would stick to straight romance because I think she does those really well. It is these mystery/romance novels that I don't think are as good. The first problem with The Witness is the main character Elizabeth/Liz/Abagail. She just isn't realistic or likeable. I don't think anyone is that robotic or socially inept. Sure she came from a controlling parental environment but I can't believe anyone or any character could really exist like her. It made the first part of the book especially difficult to read. I also wish all her books didn't have this formula of reluctant woman who doesn't want a relationship/man who is won over by a strong charismatic alpha male. I find it a little offensive that the men in these books always push the women into something they don't want (but secretly do) until the women give in and love ensues. haven't they ever heard of No means No? Brooks isn't a bad character but is a typical NR male: bossy, pushy and always sure he is right. As for the mystery, it wasn't bad but the book seemed very segmented between the first section and the second. The first is all about the mob and the murders, the second all about Abagail and Brooks falling in love. It is not really until the end that these two stories come together. However, I thought the end was really rushed and there wasn't a whole lot of tying up of loose ends. I wish more time could have been spent on the outcome of Abagail's decision. It just seemed rushed and lacking information. Not that I really wanted a longer book because this is a thick one, but I am sure some of the previous info could have been dumped for a more satisfying ending. Not the best NR book but not the worst either. Stronger characters could have made it better."}, {"userName": "Annie (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489554-annie-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "Posted on Under the CoversShortly after beginning THE WITNESS, I wondered if this book was the right match for me.

Unfortunately, the dream she is pursuing as a doctor isn\u2019t really her dream. It\u2019s her controlling mother\u2019s plan for her. One day Elizabeth just snaps and finally takes a stand against her mother. After a huge fight, Elizabeth does everything she had always wished to do \u2013 cut off all her hair, get her ears pierced, shop for thongs and go clubbing. As she does all these things, she makes her first friend and with fake IDs created by Elizabeth herself, they hit the hottest club in the city.After some drinks and some dancing, the girls are picked up by the owners of the club. Rumor has it that they are associated with some dangerous people. As Elizabeth agrees to go to their home, she knows that something bad is about to happen...THE WITNESS is a great thriller. The events in this book will have you on the edge of your seats. The villains are badass and scary and the cops are heroic and you cannot help but root for them. What I liked most about this book was the different parts to it. The beginning of it is set slightly in the past to show how much Elizabeth has come from that one unforgettable night. The next part introduces Brooks Gleason whom I adored to bits! With this part, we see a different part of Elizabeth. She\u2019s living alone with her guns in hiding and with her solitude, she has lost some of her social skills. With Brooks persistence, he coaxes her out of her hiding spot, showing her that she doesn\u2019t have to hide anymore.The romance is slow-building, but satisfying, showing that Roberts will always be one of the best romance authors out there. With the pulse-pounding events of this novel, readers will devour this book in one night like I have because of the bond you forge with the characters. You just want to know what happens.I am so glad I found this book because now I can recommend it to others who adore Nora and her books.

As before stated, I am turning into a NR junkie, this being my third NR book in a row, and I think I'm just gonna keep on going since I got all the MacKade books on nook for a good deal. Anyway, if you've ever read any of NR suspense books, such as Angels Fall or Northern Lights or Blue Smoke and liked them, I think this one will be right up your alley. It's my new favorite NR suspense!Elizabeth has such a tragic childhood, and it's heartbreaking to see a mother treat their 'offspring' that way, but without this section of the book, I think we'd lose a lot of the quirks and ways Abigail views life. Elizabeth later becomes Abigail, just FYI. Her life is not difficult, in that she doesn't worry about where her next meal will come from and doesn't experience physical abuse, but how anyone can be such a decent person after an upbringing like that just goes to show how much resilience Elizabeth/Abigail has. What she goes through after the horrifying shooting of her friend, from her mother's lack of concern for her (I mean, seriously, new definition to the words cold shoulder) and seeing her new friends, the Marshals protecting her, die for her, it's a lot for someone to take in, especially at the age of 17. I think NR does a great job of showing us Elizabeth's core and determination to survive.When we next see Elizabeth, she's now Abigail, and it's 12 years later. If I had to survive on my wits alone, I couldn't do even half the job Abigail has done. Not only is she rich, successful, and keeping herself safe, she's done it with her sanity in tact. Living a mostly reclusive life, which was not a problem in the big cities, Abigail moves to a small town in the Arkansas Ozarks, wanting fresh air, lots of space to keep others away and garden. For the first six months she's pretty successful at keeping to herself, but Brooks Gleason, the new chief of police likes to solve puzzles, and she's a definite puzzle to him. Their interactions are so great, with Abigail trying hard to be polite but closed off, and even downright rude when he won't take no for an answer. It just intrigues him more, drawing him to her. I didn't feel he was too pushy, and being nice to look at and charming to boot don't hurt either! If anything, I was sorta surprised Abigail would be so willing to get into a relationship, something she's desperately avoided for 12 years, so easily. Just a few encounters and they have sex, Abigail figures this is what he wanted all along and would go away, but it just makes Brooks more and more curious!Seeing the heroine of a book be the slightly nerdy one for a change is fun too. Abigail talks circles around Brooks when it comes to computers, and it doesn't bother him one bit, just adds to her charm as far as he's concerned. And even though Abigail is a typical NR heroine who can physically take care of herself, it's nice to see Abigail want to depend on someone for a change, even if she has a difficult time of it. Brooks is so patient and easy-going, good at drawing her out of herself, without her realizing he's doing it at first. They make a great pair together, and I really enjoyed seeing their relationship grow through Abigail's panic and Brooks care/concern for her. The whole 'protect and serve' vibe from him doesn't hurt either, in fact, it goes a long ways towards making him even sexier because he does it in such a charming and non evasive way.The actual suspense part was a little fast ending for me, and we didn't get as full a description of what happens to the bad guys, but I think the focus remaining on Abigail taking them down, doing it her way, all while knowing Brooks is there for her is the main point we're suppose to get. This isn't about the Russians, it's about Abigail putting the past to rest finally and having a real life. I thought this book might end up more like The Search, with the bad guys coming after her, but I like that it was different, and she took them down, and got to go back to her 'normal' life untouched by the violence. It's good so that she can move on and not have to view that part of her life in her everyday rest of her life.I really look forward to NR suspense books (who am I kidding, I look forward to all her books) and wish she could publish more sooner, we all know she's probably 50 books ahead, but I also appreciate the variety. Some of the wording NR uses in dialog is a little repetitive, but I don't mind it. It's obvious NR loves gardening, and for someone who has a black thumb, she does a good job of describing it for me in a way I can appreciate it, not feeling like it's a gardening book, in fact making me wish I took more of an interest in gardening, seeing all the colors in nature. And so does all that without bogging the story down. Often in other authors' attempts at suspense, it feels like an info dump or your waiting for the other shoe to drop. With NR, I never feel that way, I'm just happily absorbing all the little details along the way until I stop and realize, 'hey, I've learned a lot!' It's always like putting on my favorite pair of PJ pants and relaxing when I read a NR book.*5/29/12 Update: Listened to the audiobook, excellent job done by narrator, reading or listening to this book would be great as both are well done and deliver the story beautifully.*"}, {"userName": "Lexy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57346995-lexy", "userReview": "This book was amazing"}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "4.5 starsThe Witness is perhaps Nora Roberts\u2019 best and most successful romantic suspense novel, which is saying something considering the dozens we have to choose from. It\u2019s a long novel, as her romances usually are, but every word is thought-through and every sentence exactly in its place. Nora has a steady, experienced hand fully capable of leading us through decades of backstories and keeping us fully engaged the whole time. This story starts with an overprotected teen during her first and only rebellion. Elizabeth has one of the highest IQs ever recorded and her neurosurgeon mother has been shaping her since she was born. She was never allowed to chose her own interests, clothes or even food. So when she rebels, she does so with teen hormones and unparalleled intelligence. Needless to say, the results are disastrous. Elizabeth takes us through her most traumatic experience, the witness protection that follows and the hard truths of life. We meet her again years later and see her transformed into a competent, paranoid and solitary woman. As Abigail Lowery, she trusts no one but her dog and her social skills are virtually non-existent. When police chief Brooks Gleason shows up, Abigail\u2019s response is to arm herself with guns and knowledge and turn him away as quickly as he can. But Brooks is easygoing and incredibly stubborn, determined to learn the paranoid lady\u2019s secrets.Abigail/Elizabeth is by far the most intriguing of Nora\u2019s characters (not counting Eve Dallas and Roarke, of course). Her intelligence is reflected both in the things she does and how she interacts with others. She says the strangest things, which is sometimes annoying and sometimes endearing, but the humor that can be found in her awkwardness and all the dialogues is undoubtedly this book\u2019s strongest point.This is a book I could reread once a month and never get tired of it. Nora Roberts\u2019 unparalleled storytelling and unforgettable characters would make an addict out of any reader, which is precisely what she\u2019s been doing for over 35 years. For those of you who are new to her writing, The Witness might just be the best place to start.

She \"got\" Elizabeth/Abigail! I bumped the rating to 5 stars for the audio version. Still 4 stars for print.The Witness is a very solid 4 star book. It starts with a bang. The first 100 pages are on-the-edge-of-your-seat riveting. I wasn't at all unhappy when the pace (and my heart rate) slowed to more normal levels for the central 1/2 of the book. While the first 100 pages sets up the suspense and action part of the book, the middle 200+ pages develops both the main characters and the romance. Even though the pace slows down, there is nothing boring about the story. I never felt an urge to skim, and I'm a diehard skimmer if things get boring. Roberts does an excellent job developing the character of Brooks through the day-to-day drama he encounters as chief of police in a small town in the Ozarks. There is very little \"telling\" in this book, and a good deal of \"showing\" as Roberts uses interaction and dialogues to reveal her characters' strength and weaknesses.I enjoyed getting to know the grown-up Elizabeth/Abigail, with her socially awkward ways and her paranoid lifestyle. Roberts didn't try to pull anything over on the readers. Abigail is a genius, we learn that very early on, and only a genius could have done all the things she had. This is the one fictional \"fact\" we have to swallow for the book to work. I didn't mind swallowing it--but then I enjoy the Bourne movies, so I may just enjoy people with almost super-human mental abilities. The relationship development isn't the best I've read, but still satisfying. Brooks has some things in common with other Robert's heroes, but I liked him and liked the way Abigail held her own with him. Roberts, thankfully, went easy on the quirky sentence fragments that have been the hallmark of her dialogues in recent works. They were still there (preposition, sentences that needed but had no direct object, using nouns for verbs, using only predicates, etc.) but much less so. This could be in part because Abigail talks like the girl genius she is, so not many sentence fragments for her! ;-) I found that in The Witness the spare use of the quirky fragments actually added a unique cadence and flow to the dialogue. Her dialogue isn't so much realistic as rhythmic, but I liked it.Recommended for romantic suspense readers in general and Nora Roberts fans in particular."}, {"userName": "Glamdring", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6599667-glamdring", "userReview": "*4,5 stars*\"You're the sexiest thing, in the strangest ways.\"With The Witness we have a great story with great characters development.
