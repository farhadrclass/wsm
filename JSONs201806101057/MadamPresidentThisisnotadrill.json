The only reason she agreed to take it was because the position hinged on her father winning a presidential election. She figured she could agree to take the job, he'd lose the election, and she'd be off the hook. James Cartwright won the election. He was a widower, and had no interest in living in the White House residence by himself. Not only did he lobby to have his daughter appointed as Vice President, on the grounds of bringing her in to help reform education, he also talked her into giving up the Vice Presidential home to live in the White House with him. Things were going along well. They're now six years into their jobs, making strides in their agendas, when life as they know it comes to a screeching halt. Molly is in the middle of making a speech when Secret Service agents surround her and carry her off the stage. Within the next few hours, she is given devastating news, sworn in as the next President, charged with trying to discover who the traitor or traitors are, figuring out which nation is responsible for this mess, and is put into the precarious position of fending off a war, all while trying to mourn a parent. Molly's challenges do not stop there. She's contending with two sets of senior staff, her own and her father's. Certain people doubt her ability to maintain focus when her personal life has just been through the spin cycle. A staff member disappears when the Secret Service is spread too thin. Everyone thinks there may be pertinent information on the President's phone, and Molly has a plan on trying to hack into it, if they could just get the thing to her. Her personal aide is afraid and refuses to even step foot into the residence for fear of Lincoln's ghost. The man who targeted her father reveals himself enough to torture Molly with images, threats, and a FedEx shipment. A little digging around reveals a surprising relationship, and a long-harbored dream, Daddy was keeping secret. And, in her bid to get to the truth of all that is afoot, the rookie President turns suspicion on herself, hoping to draw the enemy forward. Note: A new, alternate ending has been added.", "title": "Madam President: \"This is not a drill.\"", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23644780-madam-president", "average": 3.74, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1432379982l/23644780.jpg", "reviews": 13, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7755849.O_L_Gregory", "name": "O.L.
