From the opening pages of this book I knew I was going to be in for a really good read when I was already laughing before the story had really even begun.Poppy is single again after the death of her husband and just learning how to be on her own again while dealing with a meddlesome mother in law when she gets an invite to her class reunion. Now Poppy does not have the fondest memories of high school with her own version of the mean cheerleaders at the forefront of her mind she is determined not to go but breaks down when her best friend begs her to come along.As torturous as the reunion sounds Poppy knows she really should return to Cape May to see her aunt who she hasn\u2019t done the best of keeping in touch with over the years. After arriving Poppy finds Aunt Ginny has been having a bit of trouble with social services due to her eccentric ways and then to top it all off Poppy finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation after the dreaded reunion.I don\u2019t even know if I can truly express just how great this little cozy gem was, I just loved the entire book. All of those little elements that get me totally engaged in a cozy were in this one, a funny and engaging main character, a spunky elderly aunt, a crazy kitty for a companion and wrap all that up with a compelling mystery to solve between the laughs.Poppy did not take but a few page turns to completely gain my attention and interest as a lead character. Here we have an \u201colder\u201d main character telling this story who is also on the plus size with a junk food addiction to ease her troubles and one heck of a character for a pet cat, I could totally relate to her almost instantly. The only thing I think might be a turn off for some is Poppy fat-shaming herself but I hate to say it but I\u2019ve been there so her sarcastic nature hooked me right in.This was also a book that I felt I got to know a lot of the other characters in the story rather easily and give the author two thumbs up for her character development. Often only a main character and possibly one or two others become as distinct but she did a wonderful job pulling me into this world and getting to know everyone. When all was said and done I was a huge fan and really look forward to many more books in this series.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.wordpress...."}, {"userName": "abby", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44478099-abby", "userReview": "This book is just pure fun. Poppy McAllister is dreading the high school reunion her best friend talked her into attending. Since the death of her husband, Poppy's life has been unraveling one cookie at a time. Her clothes no longer fit, her mother in law is breathing down her neck, and her only companion is Figaro the cat. Her dreams of becoming a pastry chef and a mother seem long gone. She doesn't need to sit in a gymnasium full of old bullies to realize her life isn't going as planned.Poppy returns to her hometown of Cape May, New Jersey and the change in scenery isn't much of an improvement. Her Aunt Ginny is being harassed by an adult services worker who is determined to force her into a nursing home. Her ex-fiance and first love is catering the reunion. Oh, and her old arch nemesis turns up dead... right in front of Poppy's old locker. She becomes the main suspect in the murder as has to prove her innocence, all while embarking on a new gluten-free diet.What sold me on this book was author Libby Klein's bio, and I knew I had a winner based on the dedication page alone: \"And to all those who bullied me in high school, I win.\" This book brought me back to the good old days from the Stephanie Plum series. Smart, sarcastic heroine with a junk food addiction who lives with a crazy grandma figure, has two men inexplicably in love with her and gets life inspiration from street-wise prostitutes? Yep, all fits. But, Poppy McAllister is wiser, older, and more real. She's the character you'd want as a friend. This is still a cozy mystery, so there's the usual elements of ridiculousness, plot holes, and cartoonish police forces, but it's nice that the investigating officer is her adversary instead of her love interest (because, frankly, the two the author gave her is bad enough). It's not a perfect book, but it's close to perfect for its genre. I highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Elle \u2726 Pretty Little Books \u2726", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44344367-elle-pretty-little-books", "userReview": "Release Date:  January 30, 2018 Genre:  Cozy MysteryWohoo!!! I loved, loved, LOVED, this book! Class Reunions are Murder is the first book in the Poppy McAllister cozy mystery series and I know it is going to be a HUGE HIT among fans of this genre. It's got everything I wanted in a cozy mystery and more! Gosh, the only thing that disappoints me is that I have to wait until July 2018 for the next installment!! This is a must read if you're a fan of cozy mysteries. If you haven't read much in the genre and want to try, this is a great place to start!MORE ABOUT THE STORY  Poppy McAllister has hit an all time low in her life. Her beloved husband died six months ago and the only thing she can successfully go is eat a little debbie snack. Feeling like her life is in shambles she has no intention of going to her high school reunion. I mean, why would she suject herself to the torture of allowing all the bullies who once tormented her about her weight do it again 25 years later? But when her friend, Sawyer forces her to go, she has no choice because she has run out of excuses. So Poppy ventures off to Jersey with her cat, Figaro in tow to stay with her eccentric aunt in the home she grew up in. Fast forward a little later when Poppy and her group of friends attend the reunion. Thinking it's only going to bring back some fond memories of her and her friends, Poppy starts to enjoy being out of the house. But that soon goes down hill when a vicious and ugly old classmate bullies her and her friends AGAIN and then is found murdered right in front of Poppy's locker... Poppy being the prime suspect is thrust into the investigation in hopes of clearing her name and finding out who really killed Barbie before she spends the rest of her time in the slammer...  OVERALL THOUGHTS  I LOVED this cozy mystery and I have every intention of continuing the series as the books are released. The author realistically portrayed the hell a hefty person goes through in both her head in in real life. She also adds laugh out loud humor into the story making readers just like me laugh until they cry. Honestly, you just cannot go wrong with this book and I can't wait till the next one is released.  WHAT I SPECIFICALLY LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK  - The brutal honesty in the authors description about how it feels to be a heavier woman. OMG I loved the inner monologue when it came to Poppy and her weight. It's so realistic and really makes me think back to how I felt when I gained weight. - The humor: It's not too often where you can fund a cozy mystery that is more humorous than serious. I think authors TRY to be a little too serious with these books and it ultimately lets down a reader who is looking for some lighthearted fun. Thankfully, this had a more humorous edge to it. - Poppy and her Grandmother: What a dynamic duo these two are! It kind of reminds me of Stephanie Plum and Grandma Mazur (don't worry though, they are noting like those characters, I mean in a close and funny way). It's also been a while since I have connected with a set of characters like these ones and I'm so glad they changed this for me.  WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE STORY - Honestly, I loved everything about this book. The only downside is that I have to wait till July to get the next one! It's well worth the wait though as I feel the series if going to be that good,  PURCHASE A COPY  Amazon Kindle: http://amzn.to/2BUe0UNAmazon Print: http://amzn.to/2BTB0Di ACTUAL RATING  5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Linda Langford at Chatting About Cozies", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10837851-linda-langford-at-chatting-about-cozies", "userReview": "New cozy author Libby Klein blasts back to the past in her debut mystery \u201cClass Reunions Are Murder\u201d.

I truly believe this was the funniest cozy I have ever read. I was laughing throughout most of the book and Poppy won my heart from the very first chapter. Written by a fellow Jersey girl, I was instantly hooked from page one and could not put this wonderful story down. The twists and turns kept coming and I had to know who dun it! Every time I thought I knew who it was, a few pages later, Libby Klein threw me for a loop and I knew I was wrong!  Poppy has just lost her husband six months ago. She has turned into a virtual hermit but somehow her best friend, Sawyer has convinced Poppy to come home to go to their twenty five year high school reunion. If anyone hated high school, it was Poppy. She was bullied all the time and couldn't get out of Jersey fast enough once she graduated. She stays with her eccentric aunt, Ginny, who she learns, is being investigated by social services. Hang on tight readers, CLASS REUNIONS ARE MURDER is going to take you on a crazy and wild ride. During the reunion, Poppy stumbles upon Barbie, who is the most hated classmate of them all. Someone has killed her right there in the hallway, right next to Poppy's old locker. Well, it isn't long before everyone thinks Poppy did it!Now Poppy finds herself investigating Barbie's murder and at first, she has a long list of suspects. CLASS REUNIONS ARE MURDER soon has Poppy's list getting shorter and shorter and Poppy is afraid she is going to wind up in federal prison. Poppy is a horrible detective and at times, she really cracked me up with her way of thinking. All Poppy wants to do is leave Cape May with her cat, Figaro and her spanx! Haha it's just so funny! I read it in one long sitting and had to know what was going to happen to Poppy and her Aunt Ginny. There are also recipes at the end of the book which is an added bonus! I'm so excited to continue with this series and will read anything by Libby Klein!"}, {"userName": "LORI CASWELL", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4770012-lori-caswell", "userReview": "Dollycas\u2019s ThoughtsThis was a fresh, fun, and very entertaining read!Poppy McAllister has been dealing with the grief of her husband\u2019s death.

She can\u2019t leave town, plus she has to help her aunt out of a huge mess, so she might as well work to find the real killer.I loved this book! Poppy is a great protagonist. I identified with her on so many levels. Her Aunt Ginny is a spitfire too, so I know where Poppy gets it. Both women are dealing with personal crisis\u2019 in addition to trying to catch a killer. I have also fallen hard for Fig. They all cracked me up several times.The plot really has two mysteries, Barbie\u2019s murder and Aunt Ginny\u2019s fight to remain in her home. They flow nicely side by side and together. The murder has so many suspects, almost anyone at the reunion could have put the cheerleader out of their misery. \ud83d\ude42 Ginny\u2019s problem is puzzling because someone has decided she is unable to care for herself and Poppy, a murder suspect, is not viewed as a good guardian. Both mysteries are complex, I had a hint as to what was happening to Ginny because something similar happened to someone I know. Barbie\u2019s murder was a doozy to solve and I was completely surprised when the killer was revealed.I also enjoyed the fact that a high school boyfriend was still sweet on Poppy and a handsome barista was interested in her too. I am looking forward to seeing which of these romances Poppy pursues in the future.Everything about this book appealed to me.

When she receives an invitation to her twenty-five year class reunion, she has no intentions on attending, but her best friend convinces her that it would be fun. Although Poppy has her doubts, her friend wears her down and she agrees to return to her hometown of Cape May, New Jersey.Unfortunately, there are old enemies who haven\u2019t changed at all in 25 years. The nasiest of all is Barbie. Barbie used to be a popular cheerleader and really awful to Poppy and her circle of friends. It turns out that Barbie hasn\u2019t changed at all. The same could be said for Barbie\u2019s group of friends. The class reunion turns out to be more than unpleasant especially when Barbie is found dead in front of Poppy\u2019s old locker. Naturally all eyes turn towards Poppy as the prime suspect. It\u2019s up to her to prove her innocence since the cops are doing nothing except blaming Poppy as well.This book had the feel of chick lit meets cozy mystery. It\u2019s funny, heartwarming, romantic and mysterious. All blended together in one exciting story. A fast-paced book bringing the heroine to the past, which wasn\u2019t a happy time for her. Combine that with her not so happy present, is much more than any one person should have to handle, but Poppy is stronger than she thinks.A 25 year old class reunion?

I did not want to put this book down. Each time I picked it up and got interrupted, I found I kept wanting to run grab the book and hide, sometimes adulting is really hard...This is one of the longest cozy mystery books I have ever held in my hand, and one of the books I did not ever want to end.

From her outlook on life, her eccentric aunt, her mother in law, her tragic backstory, her friends, her battle with her spanx and herself, there is just so much to love about this book.

The author did a great job in introducing a lot of characters at once but keeping everyone and everything clear for her readers.

All the key traditional elements \u2013 humor, small-town setting, amateur protagonist, ensemble cast, murder investigation \u2013 are beautifully blended into something special with the creative genius hand of author Libby Klein.Best of all is the lead character, Poppy McAllister, who captured my heart immediately and lives on in my mind. Grieving over the death of her husband six months earlier and dealing with a controlling mother-in-law at the same time, Poppy\u2019s coping mechanism was unhealthy food and mindless TV, resulting in an obvious weigh gain \u2013 and then comes the unthinkable class reunion invitation, bring back a flood of unpleasant memories. Especially in the beginning pages, I loved how elements of women\u2019s fiction are used to cement the characters and backstory.Another strong suit of this story is the delightful humor throughout. I\u2019d love to meet the author, for she must be a hoot. I constantly had a smile on my face as I read, often laughing out loud. Poppy\u2019s Aunt Ginny is precious, an eccentric older lady trying to prevent social services from taking control of her life. And then there\u2019s Poppy\u2019s cat, Figaro, one of the funniest fictional kitties I\u2019ve ever seen. New Jersey\u2019s Cape May setting is vividly conveyed, a place I\u2019d love to visit. If I were writing this story, the murder victim is someone I\u2019d definitely want to kill off. Suspects are plenty and guilt was not obvious to me. Also impressive to me is the depth of character development throughout, more than is usually found in this type of novel.

I like the premise of the murder taking place at a class reunion. I had read a plot like this yet in a cozy mystery. Poppy McAllister, herself, is a relatable and sympathetic main character. I liked watching her grow and gain inner strength to turn around her situation and take her future into her own hands. She is reluctantly pulled into investigating a murder after she becomes the prime suspect of the \"mean girl\" who was murdered at the class reunion. I enjoyed Poppy's friends who round out the cast nicely. They are fun, supportive and have her back. I really enjoyed Aunt Ginny. She is unique and provided a nice dose of humor, as did Figaro, Poppy's cat.The dialogue was witty and had some self deprecating humor, especially from Poppy. The mystery was woven through the story nicely. Because the victim was the \"mean girl\" there were plenty of suspects to choose from as she had offended everyone over the year. There was a nice dose of clues, twists and attempts to misdirect the reader thrown in. I enjoyed that Poppy was not instantly good at being a sleuth and has some false starts and looked at the wrong suspects. I think the story wrapped up nicely and this is a series that I think I will continue to follow.I voluntarily read an advanced reader copy provided by the publisher, Kensington, through Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Dawn Frazier", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26682484-dawn-frazier", "userReview": "Fantastic book!

(Goodreads)Review:To me this was the perfect cozy mystery. I liked the characters, I liked the humor , I liked the setting and I liked the mystery. There was nothing about this book that I did not like and nothing I would change. The characters are well rounded and well developed. I really enjoyed the fact that Poppy is an middle-aged woman and not thirty-something like most of the cozies that I read. I also really enjoyed the fact that Poppy was not a physically fit thin woman. She is overweight and struggles with many of the same issues that a lot of us have. To me that made her seem much more real. I enjoyed getting to know Poppy\u2019s friends and I liked the fact that they stuck together and had each other backs. And who would not love Aunt Ginny, with her quirkiness and eccentricities. And Figaro, the cat, is one of my favorite felines ever.I thought this book was so funny and I enjoyed Poppy\u2019s sarcastic self monologues. One of these was when Poppy thought to herself, \u201cI would love to have two children. Instead I have two chins and a cat\u201d. There was so much of this type of humor throughout the book and I was laughing out loud through much of the book. The writing style flows smoothly and the book is an easy read. I think the author addressed some more serious issues in this book. High school and the need to fit in, the popular people being mean to the less popular and self image issues were some of the things that she write about. I thought that made this book even more special. The mystery was well plotted and there were enough suspects to consider and clues to sift through. I eventually figured out the killer before it was revealed but I did make some wrong guesses first.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written cozy that was a little different than the normal cozy. It was different in a very good way. I cannot wait to read the next book in this series. I think this author was a real winner on her hands.I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for a honest review. I would like to thank NetGalley and Kensington Books for the opportunity to read and review this fantastic book."}, {"userName": "K.A.

From the beginning, I was drawn into the story and the life of the protagonist, Poppy McAllister. Like a favorite dessert, I wanted to gobble the book up all at once in one sitting but real life sometimes doesn\u2019t allow that so I had to put it down frequently. However, those interludes allowed me to savor every delicious word and scene in the story, making my reading time all the more meaningful and enjoyable. Ms. Klein has created a compelling character in Poppy, who is struggling with grief caused by widowhood. Despite her loss, Poppy\u2019s dialog and introspection is humorous and at times laugh-out-loud funny. Poppy starts out being an insecure pushover, bullied by her former mother-in-law and walked over by everyone else. Her journey back to her hometown to visit her Aunt Ginny and attend (unwillingly) her class reunion is the catalyst for Poppy\u2019s transformation. Ms. Klein accurately captures the angst of the insecurities of high school, with the descriptions of interaction between students: the popular kids, the mean girls, the nerds, those trying to just get through without being noticed. Yet through it all, the author writes with a witty sense of humor that truly adds to the entertainment of this engaging read. Of course amazing characters need a terrific plot and Ms. Klein delivers. The pace is steady and the murder mystery well thought out. Almost the entire student body attending the class reunion are suspects, Poppy included, when one of the mean girls from their class is murdered during the party. The author also weaves in another layer of mystery surrounding Poppy\u2019s Aunt Ginny and why she\u2019s being harassed by social services. It brings to light the tragic situations surrounding senior citizens and how often they are targeted for defrauding. As I read, I had to cheer for Aunt Ginny and her spunky, free spirit. She is a delightful sidekick for Poppy. The various threads of plot, suspects, and subplots are all nicely wrapped up in an exciting, suspenseful conclusion. I am counting down the days until the next installment in this terrific new series!In the book Aunt Ginny sets Poppy up with a holistic doctor who convinces her to go gluten-free and try to give the Paleo diet a try. As difficult as it is for Poppy to adhere to the diet, she does find great relief from several physical discomforts when she eats within the guidelines. In researching the author for this post, I found that she suffers from an autoimmune disease and as such eats a gluten-free diet. I discovered several years ago that I must also follow a strict gluten-free diet so I was very happy to find that Ms. Klein provides several delicious gluten-free recipes at the back of the book.I was provided an advance copy with the hopes I would review. All thoughts and opinions are my own."}, {"userName": "Fred", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1884761-fred", "userReview": "Class Reunions Are Murder is the first book in the A Poppy McAllister Mystery series.When Poppy gets an invitation to her 25th class reunion she has no desire to attend and have to see Poppy and Amber, the high school bullies.

I was enthralled with Poppy's back story and how she arrived to that point in her life. There were happy and sad moments in that regard, but it made Poppy a stronger character. I especially liked when she decided to take charge of her life and not let everyone walk all over her good nature.The mystery was very well written and the killer popped into my head, not for any clues that were blatantly left behind in the story....maybe because this character was the only one left that fit? It was quite the surprise and as with all cozies, Poppy puts herself into danger many times but manages to come out unscathed.And what would this book be without a love triangle. There is Tim, Poppy's high school sweetheart, and Gia, the owner of a local coffee shop that encourages Poppy's love of baking and providing gluten free items for him to sell.

It shows how the past catches up with everyone, even the bullies we dealt with on the road to adulthood.Poppy is a wonderful, well-rounded character with flaws and insecurities on a grand scale. After the death of her husband, she sinks into a routine of watching television infomercials, eating anything sweet and brooding about life. She is older, with half her life gone and has no desire or ambition to change things. But when she returns home and renews her friendships and confronts the past, she realizes that she still has dreams and wants to start over. Her outlook on life is very relatable for any reader who has experienced the heartbreak and devastation of life\u2019s turmoil. Aunt Ginny is wonderfully eccentric with an attitude that people half her age envy. She has everything Poppy doesn\u2019t, spunk, motivation and a way of doing things her way regardless of what anyone thinks. She makes readers hope that they are like her when they grow older.The supporting cast of characters are interesting and entertaining, some of which such as Bebe and Tawnika should have their own series. They are funny and very likable, even under the circumstance of being behind bars.The setting of the story is described in enough detail that the reader wouldn\u2019t mind visiting and spending time discovering. It is the perfect location for this story, and hopes are that the author will flesh it out more in future installments.Overall Class Reunions Are Murder is an enjoyable book. However, it isn\u2019t as fast-paced as many would like and is a bit on the long side. There is a lack of real action until the end, and this makes it difficult to keep turning the page. The reader will dislike many of the characters and will have no empathy for those that the writer may have intended to come off as someone you would have compassion for. They might also have trouble figuring out the clues to the killer\u2019s identity. The romantic interests are a bit confusing as the reader is never sure who the main interest is though they will cheer for one over the other.This book is recommended to anyone who has the time to sit down and read the story uninterrupted, and with the knowledge that not everything will be easy to figure out. That said, the plot is interesting and the story although a bit complex is fun to read. The recipes in the back are great to try!"}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2765710-jenna", "userReview": "When I saw that\u00a0Class Reunions are Murder is set in Cape May, New Jersey, I jumped at the chance to read and review. I've visited Cape May a couple of times while spending time in the Garden State visiting friends (shout out to Craig and Charlene!) and it's a charming, delightful spot. I always have high hopes for books set in familiar and well-liked locales - I was not disappointed.\u00a0Class Reunions are Murder is a perfect mix of chick lit and cozy mystery. Lured back to Cape May for her class reunion, Poppy McAllister finds her childhood home in disrepair and her eccentric aunt in danger of being forced into a senior living community. Before she can fully figure out what's going on with her aunt, Poppy is at her class reunion, pulling her best friend out of a fight with the class mean girl, and wondering if she has time to drag the mean girl's body away from in front of her old locker before calling for help. Who would have thought that a jailhouse pep talk would be the catalyst for so much change in Poppy's life?I\u00a0so enjoyed this story. Libby Klein writes the character of Poppy with wonderfully warm, funny, and charming characteristics. I can't decide if I wish I were best friends with the author or the character! (Let's just be greedy and say both Libby and Poppy are my new BFFs.) The mystery is straightforward, yet complex; there are a plethora of suspicious characters who may have reached a breaking point with the meanest girl in school. And, even better, alongside the potential killers are Poppy's friends, a handsome barista, a still-enamored high school sweetheart, a kooky cat, and the best series debut I've read in quite some time."}, {"userName": "Kirsti", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5581493-kirsti", "userReview": "Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for the chance to read this book! Dammit, this book has so many things I hate, and yet I ended up loving it anyway! For starters, as a plus sized woman myself, it's really depressing when you read a character that not only hasn't accepted their weight, but envies thinner women around them...it wasn't shaming exactly, but Poppy is so lost in the mire of her own self that she fails to see anything else. The good news is that by the end of the book, she really IS trying, and has realized some parts of her life need to change for her own sanity and happiness. She also appears to making friends and not judging so much, so at least there is growth?The other thing that I normally hate but had to deal with here is; the death that is meant to be investigated in cozy mystery came waaaay too late in the narrative. 28% in on my Kindle, and for a cozy to spend over a quarter of the book without the mystery was a little disappointing. I get that we had to set Poppy and her friends up, give background etc, but it was a long tedious journey.So I had two massive problems and I STILL rated it five stars? Because I couldn't bloody help it. Despite everything, I related so well to Poppy, I loved reading about her gluten allergy and her two possible romances, I adored Aunt Ginny and Figaro, her friends are awesome, and when we finally did get the mystery it was a good one with multiple suspects. All of the things I hated to begin with ended up with resolution, which I guess proves you can never be sure if you DNF a book early on.
