It was a brilliant idea and with Julianne's forensic background she was able to bring to the plate not only a scientific take but her own passion for the genre. We as readers are immersed in a daily fight for survival. From the early days. Unlike with The Walking Dead where Rick wakes up much later, this is them riding the wave of infection out of Toronto. I cannot remember how many times I cringed and held my breath and a few times a tear rolling down my face. Just such a well wrought story. Flushed out from the original web series, it brings to light the power of individuals in the need and desire to survive.There are parts of these days that definitely make this a mature read. The video games have rated most zombie games as Mature (17 and above) I would have to label this read with the same. Not because there is tons gore and violence, there is but it is not in a gratuitous amount. Specifically there are scenes with particularly small individuals that I would not want my 16 year year old, let alone the younger ones, reading just yet.The subject of zombies and a zombie apocalypse is popular to the point of being a viral constant (heh viral) on the net and in other media formats, such as books and movies. So how does one make it original enough to go grab this one up? Why should you buy it? Well because of the unique approach the author has taken. The strength in her prose as well as the sociological and cultural questions asked and answered each night as her protagonist and others in the group wrap up the day up on a random hijacked and ever diminishing wireless signals. The laptop; her last precious attachment to her past. The questions and the struggles this group of survivors face is monumental and has just enough of an edge to make it a bit fantastic but also very believable. You feel the intensity of the day with them, as they try to bunk down for the night, you are on the edge of your seat with anticipation and train-wreck like obsession. Julianne does not disappoint!I am leery of I keep going on I will give to many spoilers. But can say honestly that this was an adventure I started taking on her blog and have been thrilled to have it flushed out and in a single novel. One note, this is worth reading for one specific reason... other than what I mention about.. the virus is not discriminatory. That is all I will share but I encourage you think about the statement and let your imagination wander enough to have you click and buy the book, you won't be disappointed.Recommended for zombie enthusiasts, survivalists and those needing to prepare for the ZA.triggers - Violence over all and in regards to children in one scene.What would you do? How would you survive? During the first 33 days after patient zero follow a group of survivors as they are faced with the challenges of staying alive and ahead of the horde. It is spring and the dead are defrosting their teeth and arising from the snow drifts.. Days with the Undead is finally here!"}, {"userName": "Kami", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/860720-kami", "userReview": "This book was gifted to me by the author for an honest review. Thank You.I feel like I know zombies pretty well. I own a copy of the Zombie Survival Guide. I have watched every episode of the Walking Dead. I've watched a Romero movie or four. I know that you aim for the head. And I know you need to get out of the cities but don't take the roads. So do I feel confident that I would survive a zombie apocalypse? Naw. I wouldn't last a week.Days with the Undead: Book One is a journal of survival. It begins on day 3 and ends on day 31. There is an ER doctor, a forensic pathologist, a sniper, an intelligence officer, and an environmental scientist. They are all zombie fans and zombie survivalists. Weapons experience, an expert in edible plants, a map collector and \u201ca mechanical and technological junkie\u201d. \u201c...just a group of people trying to stay alive.\u201dLike I said before, I like a good zombie story. I like the saga of the fight for survival. Days with the Undead had a really good description of the zombie outbreak as told by the ER doctor. I liked how each character had a story to tell about their life, their sacrifices, their mistakes and their pain. They were each sympathetic and I liked them all. Crazy stuff was happening with the outbreak and each day the narrator asks for her readers to pray and fight for the living. The group doesn't really have a plan. They just want to go somewhere safe. They move from Canada to the United States and back to Canada while the narrator searches the internet for a safe place and posts her journal entries. This is a well written zombie tale with unique elements."}, {"userName": "Nina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7343348-nina", "userReview": "Julianne Snow has written a terrific book chronicling the journey of a group of survivors that are struggling through the Zombie Apocalypse. One of the things I enjoyed most about reading this book is that it takes a look at things from a different perspective. We follow along day by day through the voice of the main character who has a background in forensics and was a survivalist herself before the apocalypse came. The book is based on Julianne's very popular web serial by the same title. It's a great read if you're a Zombie, Apocalypse, or just Horror fan."}, {"userName": "Matt Schiariti", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12981352-matt-schiariti", "userReview": "A handful of survivalists. They'd always joked about the idea of using their skills to flee hordes of the undead. When it actually happens, they find it's no longer a laughing matter. Welcome to the journal of Julie, pathologist and part-time survivalist, as she chronicles the events of nearly a month as she and her eclectic band of friends journey from Canada, through the United States, and back again, always trying to stay one step away from throngs of the Undead. If you're out there and you happen upon her blog, you may want to pay attention. It may just save your life.Zombie novels are the latest craze in genre fiction these days. There are literally hordes (pardon the pun) of them coming out nearly every day. I imagine it's easy for some of them to get swallowed (pardon the pun AGAIN!) by the sheer numbers being released. Days With The Undead should stand out as something a little bit different.It's told in the first person. That's nothing new, but what gives Days a different flavor (need I say it?) is that it's told entirely as a sequential series of blog entries. The book opens up on Day 3, after the Undead begin to take over the city of Toronto. Julie and her friends/fellow survivalists are already fleeing the city. They are, for the most part, on their own. The government isn't doing anything, the news isn't reporting anything about it. She takes it upon herself to start the blog as a means to educate the masses: Yes, this is happening. No, we're not crazy. Please, run. The journal takes the reader on a broad journey as the group travel across boarders and states, always staying one step ahead of the undead masses.One thing in particular that makes this a bit different is that there is no dialogue. Zero. The entries are all 'written' by Julie's hand, as she experiences them. It was a little strange at first; a book with no dialogue? But here, it works. It lends a serious and dire quality to the book. It's as if we're traveling with her, experiencing everything she does right along with her. Being a book centering around the animated dead, the experiences are dark and horrifying. Do they stop and help the hapless people they run into or do they opt for self preservation? What will they do when they encounter strangers? Fight or flight? What CAN they do to help people who won't even help themselves? Julie and her band have to make some important and heart breaking decisions. This isn't a book about fuzzy bunnies, that's for sure.I liked Snow's style. It flows well and there's just enough detail to describe the surroundings without being overly wordy. The more gory aspects of the novel are handled in a way that's just right; not too gratuitous, but just brutal enough. This isn't a book about vivid blood and guts. It's about the trials and tribulations of the main character and what she and her friends go through as they live through hell, day in, day out, for nearly a month.I did have a few issues though. In the early goings, I found the lack of any type of government or military response to be a little bit beyond belief. The limited perspective tones that down however, because Julie and her group just don't know what's going on and are too busy fleeing for their lives every hour of every day to stop and ask. Also, I found a little bit of repetition with certain phrases. Not a deal breaker, but I did notice it. Also, because there is no dialogue, it took a little while for me to get into it. In the interest of full disclosure, I was going to rate this a 3.5......and then I got to the ending. Something happens that made me see everything I'd read up to that point in a new light. I won't give spoilers, but it's definitely a twist that I didn't see coming, and that bumped it back up to a solid 4 stars. While I won't give it away, I will say the author doesn't 'pull a fast one' and it makes perfect sense, thus giving the ending a very satisfying quality.Kudos to Snow for doing things a bit different (a novella with no dialogue) and taking the path less traveled."}, {"userName": "David Watson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6600299-david-watson", "userReview": "I recently read Days With The Undead by Julianne Snow. This is a story of what happens when the dead rises and take over the planet, but its more then that. Days With The Undead is a survival manual that hopefully will save your life during the zombie apocalypse. The main character is a pathologist named Julie and her tale is told through a series of blog posts which started three days after Brooks VanReit rose from the dead.Julie and her four companions are trying to escape ground zero and find a place where the dead have not taken over. They have a lot of challanges ahead of them including dealing with zombie chipmunks.I really enjoyed how the story was told. The description of the dead coming to life in the hospital was great. I loved the way the people in the hospital reacted and the cover up that went on because the authorities didn\u2019t know what they were dealing with. Another good scene was when the main characters we\u2019re fighting the undead in a park and they have to decide if there survival is more important then rescuing two kids surrounded by the undead. At this point the survivalists had made it clear that surviving went above everything else. I didn\u2019t know how the situation was going to go and to me that made it the best part of the book.I also liked all of the different people that the five survivors meet on the journey. Not everyone reacts the same to the plague sweeping across the U.S. and Canada. Some people have lost all hope, Some people want to steal what ever they can get their hands on and some people just want to pretend its not happening. There is one funny scene in particular where a group of people are protesting the undead\u2019s march across America.What makes Days With The Undead different from other zombie novels that I\u2019ve read is that its all told in first person. You get to hear Julie and her companion\u2019s back stories as told by Julie. You also get Julie\u2019s perspective on how society is falling apart and their plan on how they are going to survive. As the story moves along, you get to see her attitude change from being positive to loosing hope, to regaining hope as it looks like they may find an answer to their problems. If you like a good bloody zombie tale then you will love this one."}, {"userName": "Laura Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7491783-laura-thomas", "userReview": "This was a bit different for me. The story is narrated by Julie as an ongoing journal on the internet. She is recording everything that has happened to her and her 4 friends starting three days after the outbreak, as they go on the run, seeking someplace safe from the zombies.Right away, I liked how the author addressed people\u2019s reactions to the news of the flesh-eating outbreak. Many just went about their daily lives. That is, until the zombies came calling.Some of the towns they passed through were untouched, while others were ravaged. They had to be careful not only of the zombies. There were pirates out there, goons who would as soon shoot you as help you. They want what you\u2019ve got, plain and simple.While telling her tale, Julie begins relating each of her friends stories. What happened to them when the outbreak occurred and how they came to be together.If you are going to survive, you have to get tough, keep your group small, and keep moving. No stopping to help anyone, and no letting someone join the group, no matter what.It\u2019s easy to think, but harder when they\u2019re faced with some choices.Zombie fans know that things happen. Not everyone can survive. You expect losses. But don\u2019t you wish it didn\u2019t have to be that way?By writing this as a journal, Julianne did an excellent job. I was actually picturing the scenes, nodding at some things, and hoping the zombie apocalypse stayed what it is. Fiction.You can learn a lot about surviving the apocalypse by reading Julie\u2019s journal.I was going to give this 4 stars but the ending bumped it right up to 5!

When I first started reading it, I was unsure how much I would like reading an entire book in journal form without any conversation between characters. The way Julianne Snow writes the characters and scenes in the journal form is splendedly fun and makes for a quick read. Her method of expressing each character's feelings without having them speak or moving into their heads was well done. Everything is told from one person's POV and it worked really well in this book. After the patient-zero shows up in Canada it doesn't take long for the infection to spread, turning people into an undead horde hungry for flesh. The point making this a very interesting read is as the group escapes Canada to the United States, they encounter people who have no idea what is going on up North. Once the infection spreads to the states, their trip to find safety is wrought with danger and strife.Overall it is a very enjoyable read and the ending left me speechless and wanting more."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/967904-christy", "userReview": "I liked this book because it raises some things that I think about while watching The Walking Dead.

I had picked it up from an author I had met at FanExpo in a town not far from where I live. We quickly become acquaintances, and I agreed to read the book to give her an honest review. Well, Julianne, this is my review!The book was a great new take on Zombies, which is hard to believe because I have read sooooo many zombie stories that I can't think of any new takes on it. But you managed to capture my attention, and I loved how the different stories of people were incorporated into the book without interrupting the way the story was told.The story is told in a blog style, where the narrator is posting online her story day by day from the beginning and telling people what she is experiencing. She is accompanied by her friends, Barbara, Max, Ben, and Bob, with whom she has met over the years and who have all been preparing for this day and who all had first hand experience with the zombies.The group is trying to outrun the centre of the outbreak which had started in their home city of Toronto, Canada. Along the way they will have to stick together and turn away other survivors if they hope to survive. And without a real plan, they begin heading away from the Undead that are following them in hopes that they will be able to find a safe place to wait for the military to deal with the situation.But as things begin to get worse and they realize that the military can't do much to help anyone, they have to come up with another plan to get to safety. With each of them being trained in a helpful task they are able to get further than most survivors.Barbara: An Environmental Scientist knows which herbs and berries can be eaten on the road, and which wood from tress can become the most effective hand-to-hand weapons when needed on the run.Ben: A trained Doctor and an expert in reading Maps, he was present at the Hospital when Patient Zero turned and began hunting down it's next victim. After escaping he took to the road with his friends.Max: A trained marksman in the Canadian Military, a sniper, who had to make some very hard decisions when he went with his friends to run from the vastly infected city behind him.Bob: Also from the Canadian Military, his is a veteran and has worked for the Canadian Intelligence for years before heading out of town with his old Military friend Max and the rest of his friends.Julie: Our narrator and a Forensic Pathologist, she had seen first hand what the dead could do when they were brought restrained to her office, and was well aware the dangers when she took off onto the road with her friends from the madness in the fleeting city.I loved the way the story was told, as I have seen Journal format, and I have seen News Report format, but I have never seen anyone do the blog route. I liked the story, I liked the narrator, and though at times I have trouble believing that she could still get internet access to post her entries, I loved the way it was done.Anyone who likes Zombie books would be good to get into something like this! It is realistic in every sense, and it was clear that proper research was done so that the story flowed better and there were no unanswered questions.I would give this one a 4 out of 5 stars, and would recommend any horror/Zombie story fans to check it out!See you all next Monday!- K"}, {"userName": "Linda Laforge", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26651504-linda-laforge", "userReview": "Even if you've never read a zombie book or watched a zombie movie, you've probably wondered how on earth you could survive the end of the world. I talked about that with the author of \"Days with the Undead\", who I met at Fanexpo. We were side by side for three days selling our books.I bought her book despite my lack of ability to be a total zombie fan. That's not to say I haven't seen both old and new zombie movies. I'm just not an aficionado and I would never have purposely sought out a zombie book to buy and read but I had to. Mz. Snow was full of exuberance and zombie knowledge and I felt compelled not only to support another indie author, but to jump into something new. That being said, \"Days with the Undead\" is a novella, making it a quick weekend read when life doesn't get in the way. The main character July, is a former pathologist and part-time survivalist who is joined by a group of survivalist friends who are ex-military, doctors, environmental scientists, and a few others. It's a first person narrative, originally written as part of a blog the character was using to communicate her struggles and survival adventures to the world.I liked that the epicentre of the apocalypse starts in Toronto, though I'd like to think we Canadians wouldn't be at fault in any way. We follow their escape into the U.S. as long distance witnesses to the atrocities caused by hungry dead people. There is a touch of humour, carnage and heart pumping drama. I enjoyed the read.I'm hoping to see Julianne Snows future books, hopefully in third person so we can get to know all of her characters in greater depth as they continue to struggle to survive the zombie apocalypse."}, {"userName": "Sharon Stevenson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14741296-sharon-stevenson", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book for honest review. 'Days with the Undead' is the journal account of a zombie apocalypse, filled with warnings of what to do and what not to do when zombies attack.The narrator Julie is a no-nonsense doctor who right from the first entry comes across as someone who has seen it all and doesn't want to see anyone else make the same mistakes she has already witnessed. She does come across a bit on the cold side but there is an explanation for this which appears much later in the book. The moments of horror glimpsed in the beginning are gory and well depicted but the true terror in this tale of survival is not unveiled until close to it's well plotted ending. I was uncertain where the story was going when I started reading it but I was satisfied by how it ended and it really stuck in my head - I actually kept thinking back to the story long after I put it down.So while in the beginning Julie's journey didn't seem so unusual for a zombie apocalypse survivor, the story does take a surprising twist and suddenly becomes more than meets the eye. I was very impressed by this unexpected development as it elevated the story from the typical to the brilliant in an instant. The ending for me is also where the weight of the apocalyptic events lies, in the horrors of what Julie has endured to survive. It goes a long way to explaining her stern attitude and at times cold retellings of events. Overall this is a well plotted zombie apocalypse story with a brilliant ending.

She tells of their life on the road, the difficulties they face, the undead, the police from other states who have not been properly informed of the outbreak, the bad humans killing and maiming other survivors just because they can or to steal their stuff.She also tells each of their back stories, and what they were doing on the day \u2018patient zero\u2019 was admitted into the hospital only to die and come back to life. This story is packed from start to finish with action, blood and gore and kept me glued to it. I couldn't get enough of each of their stories as well as their combined effort to survive and couldn't wait to see how it would end. As for the ending- wow.
