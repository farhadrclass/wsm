And of course, love is at the center of the plot. However, the plot doesn't seem to be as cohesive as it could be. And there was this one thing that the author did that drove me NUTS! She overused alliteration. At first I thought it was a one time thing, but she did it at least a dozen times. And it was so out of place. It usually was what the main character was thinking and who would think that way? Here's an example of the crazy alliteration: She's discreetly limping from the disappointing discomfort of the ankle disfigurement which occurred between the disgorging of ants from the floor and the disentanglement of the three of us atop the coffee table. But she'll heal; it's just slightly discolored. And here's another one: I'd hate to appear indecorous while inadequately intoning the insupportable invisibility of my best friends in my time of injustice just because I may have inadvertently been insensitive. At first I thought it was a fluke, but then they kept coming a lot more near the end of the book. Very annoying and not at all with the rest of the tone of the book."}, {"userName": "LAURIE FIELDMAN", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10672617-laurie-fieldman", "userReview": "Quirky, fun romp through the lens of Chicago interior designer Lily on her first TV DIY show- deadlines, producers, and coworker delights/challenges, while bringing to life her mad skills. Side shows of her personal life with: her parents, mostly Mom; her 2 best friends since elementary school, and their very colorful adult conversations; along with their hilarious sexy dating escapades which feature running internal commentary and the de rigueur girlfriend feedback sessions. My faves are while working out together with their male personal trainer. Observe Lily transitioning from the supposed emotional safety of one- nighters and other inappropriate scenarios to what a grownup relationship not only looks like but feels like.Yes, the alliteration was funny the first time, then distracting. Yet, finally I looked at as an amusing way to boost my vocabulary. Quick, enjoyable read. I'd read her other books first and am conditioned to jump to the last pages for culinary recipe deliciousness. Ha.

I didn't feel connected to any of the characters. They all seemed like tropes. I also didn't particularly like any of the relationships; didn't dislike them either though. I did think the friendships were lacking. The plot was fun. A few of Lily's rules were fun and gave good insight to her character. I enjoyed the \"trading spaces\" meets dating show aspect; thought it was original despite these things existing relevantly in pop culture. Despite the grounded ideas, and normal people characters; none felt real.

I realized as I got into it that she was treating the reader like a new friend.

Odd, that.This writer had me laughing out loud on the plane from DIA to ORD.

I pee for at least forty-six minutes, brush my teeth, pull off my sweater and bra, and get into my delicious bed.\"regarding the assembly of a small bookshelf unit from IKEA:\"... the electric combination of Birdie's slightly below-par intelligence, Ken's general ineptness [shouldn't that be \"ineptitude\"?], and the fact that he is staring so intently at Birdie's chest that Bob the Director has to stop filming twice to get him to look up, it's an unmitigated disaster.\"About the frequently-botoxed Ashleigh:\"... and much to the chagrin of Ashleigh, who was in the seat opposite glaring as best as she could without benefit of mobile eyebrows.\"on Hillary's lecture:\"Let's recap, shall we? So far this 'adventure' has included some bonding with Mom, a guest appearance on a prank show, a fling with a movie star, a one-night stand with your producer, and now you'll be doing work with a former drunken booty-call boy! I'd say that was the kind of adventure usually reserved for the anorexic party children of the ancestrally wealthy.\"(\"the anorexic party children of the ancestrally wealthy\"?! seriously, is that brilliant writing or what?!)Having lived in the Chicago area for 12 years, I loved all the familiar references, especially going to Schaumburg to the IKEA.

Not exactly sure why he was here except to be: The guy. There was a gay couple in the beginning that was highlighted. They started to see a couples therapist and we never heard from them again.

It was unique to pair television interior decorating with a storyline human enough to keep the reader interested \u2013 job well done! This is a fun tale of Lily Allen, thirty-something, single and size 14 with no shortage of love-interests \u2013 just as it should be! She has just gotten a great new job as a designer on a TV reality show called Swap/Meet, where two people get their rooms re-done and a personal makeover and then are paired up after the show to see if any romantic sparks develop. Unfortunately, Lily\u2019s love life is sketchy, at best. When the story begins, she\u2019s making a hasty exit after having a-sex-on-the-first-date night with a guy that she doesn\u2019t know very well \u2013 she\u2019s embarrassed and ashamed and leaves, determined to never see him again, besides she knows she\u2019s going to be very busy with the brand new show and her personal decorating business. Before you know it, she\u2019s discovering intimate details with her co-workers, but still not finding a relationship. Although casual sex is dangerous and not to be taken lightly, it was nice to see that this \u201cbigger\u201d girl was obviously very attractive and basically comfortable with her size. I also agree with another reviewer that the girl on the cover of the book could have matched Lily better, as the author mentions more than once that Lily has curly hair!As the story continues, not only is the TV show a success, but Lily begins to really know herself and figures out why she\u2019s been settling for those brief encounters. This was good chick lit and a fast read and definitely a unique look at \u201clove and the single girl\u201d."}, {"userName": "Janel", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6986051-janel", "userReview": "Where to start....The concept for this story was so great and fun, having the lead character Lily get a job as a designer on a Trading Spaces type show. The book sparkled when it described the behind the scenes of the shoots, and had me waxing nostalgic for the early days of that show....To this day I give that show credit for inspiring my frequent home decorating endeavors. The tone of the book is light and happy, and clearly the author seems to be cheerful spirit. My problems with the book were the crass and vulgar personality of the lead character Lily. I'm no prude, I promise you, but the use of the c-word(!!!) was just too much. And the f-bomb? Conservative estimate of usage? At least 70 times....in a 295 page book! I also had to hear about her, well, flatulence for a whole chapter, and I can see getting carried away and sleeping with a hottie you hardly know once, but this was a way of life for this chick. I also couldn't quite find it realistic that all these McDreamies were so interested in her. The friendship between the 3 girls (Lily and her 2 childhood best friends) was somehow grating as well. Also who she ended up with at the end? Really? A super cute concept in need of some trash word editing, and a real romantic male lead that actually , ya know makes you kind of sigh....just a little."}, {"userName": "Angela Holland", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2340220-angela-holland", "userReview": "What I thought of this book:I really liked this book. It has one of my favorite things a house/room remodel show and a fashion makeover. Let's talk about the characters: Lily - I really liked her and felt bad for her for not being able to find a \"boyfriend\", Naomi and Hillary - they were great friends to Lily and helped her to see what she was doing wrong. I liked that the three of these ladies had been friends since they were little. Curt - I thought he was a good work friend for Lily and I liked how they played off each other. Jake and Gary - I did not like as they were trying to much to be players. Ashleigh - I also did not like her as she just was not nice. The two fashion designers Bryan and Jou were good guys just going through a touch time in their relationship. Another thing I liked was how at the beginning of some of the chapters we got a synopsis of that week's episode of the tv show. This book really read quickly and smoothly for me. It was the first book I have read by this author and I am looking forward to reading more of her books. What did I think of the cover:I thought the cover was very fitting for this book.

Lily is thrilled with the opportunity but finds herself hit with a hard dose of reality--the home makeovers don't go as smoothly as intended, her lifelong best friends accuse of her letting work consume her life, and her life is sadly lacking in romance. Although she has a series of flings, she can't get herself to face the one guy who was interested in a relationship.This book had a fun premise; the makeover TV show is what made me decide to read it. This is good example of true chick-lit, with Lily living the single life, bouncing between relationships, and having some great friends to support her on her journey to self-realization and growth.

I enjoyed the dialogue between the main character, Lily Allen, and her best friends - Hillary and Naomi. All three women are having relationship problems.

She is mortified that she did such a thing. Ron tries several ways to get Lily to go on another date, but Lily finds excuse after excuse until Ron finally gives up.

I loved reading the chapters with the crazy tenants, the crazier rooms, and the craziest designs. This book would have easily received 4 stars from me if not for 2 things: (1) there were these sections in the book where the author tried a bit too hard to be funny by using alliteration. Enough with that already! Once was cute, but more than that? It is only in one section of the book, which makes me think the author thought it was funny for the 2 days she wrote it, then came to and it stopped. (2) I didn't really feel a connection between the friendship of the 3 girls.

The parts where the main character was constantly sleeping with men on the first date and then swearing up and down that she never does this bothered me. Clearly you do do this alot.
