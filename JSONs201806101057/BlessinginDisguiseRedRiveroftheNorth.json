I am still glad I read the Blessing series. My favorites will remain An Untamed Heart and An Untamed Land. Ingeborg was my upmost favorite to read about and Hjelmer my least. I was sad Ingeborg did not make it into this book much; but I really enjoy the flow and light romance that has accompanied this series. It's not cheesy or flowery or overly descriptive and I also appreciated the lack of detail that went into explaining the women's appearance. Sometimes beauty can be so overstated! If you enjoy homesteading books or the pioneer feel then escape to the town of Blessing!!"}, {"userName": "\u0391\u1f30\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b7", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2729145", "userReview": "Skipped everything besides the main story line because I found everything else boring."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32690472-kim", "userReview": "Even though I really have enjoyed this series, and liked the main story thread of this book with Augusta and Kane, I have to mark it down to three stars because of the abrupt ending and all the dangling storylines!

The scenes at the Ranch were infinitely MORE interesting than the scenes in Blessing - and that's saying a LOT! The premise started out well, with Agusta not knowing how to speak English, getting off at the wrong station, etc., but hearing, \"Oh, if she could only understand what he was saying!\" repeated for what seemed to be a million times - got OLD VERY QUICKLY. The Norwegian words for \"Thank you\" was also used what seemed to be a million times - ACK! I only finished the book because I felt like I had to - every time time it switched to Blessing, I GROANED. Can't do another one of these; sorry.Since I don't normally write reviews unless I have something specific to say, here's the breakdown of how I rate my books...1 star... This book was bad, so bad I may have given up and skipped to the end. I will avoid this author like the plague in the future.2 stars... This book was not very good, and I won't be reading any more from the author.3 stars... This book was ok, but I won't go out of my way to read more, But if I find another book by the author for under a dollar I'd pick it up.4 stars... I really enjoyed this book and will definitely be on the look out to pick up more from the series/author.5 stars... I loved this book! It had earned a permanent home in my collection and I'll be picking up the rest of the series and other books from the author ASAP."}, {"userName": "Georgianne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17531331-georgianne", "userReview": "Ahhhhh, well I certainly did love this series, and the many characters have come to feel like family to me. This last book ended rather abruptly and I was hoping for more of a wrap-up, as there were some loose ends with no resolution. I know that some of the characters carry over into several new series, so I am looking forward to some of my curiosities being satisfied there. Lauraine Snelling is such a wonderful author, and her stories are filled with so much historical detail and interesting facts. I certainly learned a few things along the way. It was amazing to see all of the changes that took place from book one all the way through book 6, starting with absolutely nothing but 6 people emigrating from Norway and arriving in America, traveling out west with a wagon and team, to bulding a complete town by the name of Blessing, ND. Such a tough hard working group of people, these Norwegians! They faced so many trials and heartbreaking losses along the way. I am not one for a lot of sadness in my reading and some of it was difficult for me, but it was also amazing to to see how they dealt with their losses, struggled with their faith, and how they celebrated the good times with such joy, and lots of coffee and cookies! Through all of their struggles, it was so satisfying to watch how God restored to them so much of what they had lost. I'm sad to come to the end of The Red River of the North series.

She loves to be read to, she always has. Reading is one of the few things that we can do together Diana liked this book and quickly gave it a five star rating. I thought it was quiet good as well, so I didn't argue with her. The story is something of a comedy of errors. If you read book five, you will know that Hjelmer's mother Bridget wanted to open a boarding house in Blessing. The menfolk built her a building and now she has her boarding house, but needs help to do the work to keep it operating. So she writes to her daughter Augusta in Norway and invites her to come help. On the way, Augusta gets on the wrong train and at the end of the line, she meets Kane Moyer, a rancher, who is awaiting the arrival of his Norwegian mail order bride who is detained in Norway. See where this is going? By the way, Augusta speaks no English and Kane speaks no Norwegian. On the way to the ranch, Kane and Augusta stop at the Justice of the Peace's place and are married. Augusta has no idea what is happening. Kane thinks his mail order bride has arrived and that things are wonderful. I'll let you read the last of the series for your self to answer the questions that you must have like: What are the Bjorklund's going to do when Augusta's trunk arrives in Blessing without Augusta? What will happen when the real mail order bride arrives?

She thanks him for the tickets to his ranch, & informs him that she will be changing her arrival time from September 1 to October 1, so he will not have to meet the train on September 1, 1889.The story starts in Blessing, North Dakota on July 3, 1889. Bridget Bjorklund was not looking forward to repeating the same things again tomorrow. When her son, Hjelmer, questioned her about sitting down, she changed the subject of the conversation to having coffee. The heat was another topic of conversation. When he asked how the new girl was working out, she offered him a cookie. Everyone thought she was too old to run a boardinghouse, but she only was doing the same things she did in any home she lived in! The coffee was almost ready, & she thought about the cookies she should be bagging. Hjelmer insisted that she write to Augusta, her oldest daughter, so she wrote the letter in Norwegian, since Augusta hadn't learned English yet. She offered to hire both Augusta & Elmer, her intended, if they were willing to move to Amerika. When Hjelmer asked what was wrong with her face, she admitted she had a toothache. After Hjelmer left she put a whole clove on the aching tooth."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11531941-sarah", "userReview": "Sixth book in the Red River Of The North series. I found this book to be rather good and it happens to be the last of this series. Augusta Bjorklund was called, by her mother, to come to America from Norway.
