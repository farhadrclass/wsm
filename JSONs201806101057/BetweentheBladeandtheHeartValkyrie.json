{"ratings": 750, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Katerina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5014021-katerina", "userReview": "That was not the best way to start 2018.I am familiar with Amanda Hocking's work, since her Trylle Trilogy and Kanin Chronicles hold a special place in my heart. That is why it saddens me to no end to admit that Between the Blade and the Heart was a big miss for me.Between the Blade and the Heart is the first book of a duology based on norse mythology. The world is divided between Mortals and Immortals; Mortals have a short lifespan, but they can determine their own fate, whereas \u0399mmortals live forever, but their path is set in stone, and fundamental choices about their nature do not belong to them. In order to maintain the balance, the gods created the Valkyries, mortals bestowed with supernatutal strength and abilities, assigned to murder immortals and return them to the Underworld. Malin is a Valkyrie in training, but when she discovers a horrible truth about her mother's past, she becomes a pawn to a conspiracy set into motion hundreds of years ago. In the end, it seems that her mother's choice will cause the end of free will, and humanity.Perhaps I shouldn't read this one so soon after Norse Mythology. I was mesmerized by Neil Gaiman's storytelling, and the way he preserved an authentic, nostalgic vibe to his narration of nordic myths, and as a result Amanda Hocking's approach did not sit well with me. I was introduced to a world which at first seemed like a cheap imitation of the Mortal Instruments, only to later realize that humans and supernatural beings coexist (for example your car mechanic has horns and it's totally cool, even sexy if you're into those things), and then hovercrafts and flying motorcycles were thrown into the mix and my expectations were scattered to the wind. Amanda Hocking's universe did not lack imagination, but I wanted something more traditional, I guess, and the futuristic element took me by surprise. To be fair, my not so enthusiastic reaction towards the world-building is something entirely subjective, and I would propably overlook it if that was my only issue. Sadly, the characters and the romance did not help either. The relationships were frustratingly superficial, they didn't evoke any emotions, and their backround was poorly established, they were friends or lovers because the author told you they were, not because she showed you the way their bonds ran deep and true. I didn't care about them at all, I was totally indifferent to their fates, they could live or die, hurt or smile and still I didn't give a damn. And it only gets worse.Most of you must know by now that there's nothing I hate more than love triangles. So yeah, Between the Blade and the Heart had one of those, too.There's your girl, Malin, who broke up with her girlfriend for reasons I can't quite comprehend but still pines over her and salivates at her glowing hair and her crooked smile, and then she meets this gorgeous guy who makes her feel safe and warm and gives her palpitations, and she has a thing for them both. And she acts on the thing she has for them both.The world is literary burning but Malin can't control her hormones. She is overcome with lust at the most inappropriate times, and the heat fogs her brain and she can't make rational decisions. I haven't encountered the need to play savior so far, but I'd rather think that my mind would be on the demons I'm facing next day instead of kissing the one love interest and ten minutes later cuddling with the second. Or maybe it's just me, I don't know.I skimmed the last chapters because after a while I gave up trying to feel something about these characters except from irritation and exasperation, but I still wanted to learn the conclusion of the story, and that's how I made it to the end. I may sound harsh and bitter, but believe me, my heart is full of sorrow because I know Amanda, I know she is capable of magic and great things, and it kills me to say that Between the Blade and the Heart was not one of her best works. It was still fast-paced and action-packed, and the ideas behind it full of potential, so if you're up for the task, please give it a try. But if you want to truly appreciate her storytelling abilities and swoonworthy romances, I'd say read the Kanin Chronicles instead.*ARC generously provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "DNF so I'll leave off a rating.

There is some good world-building here with some obscure supernatural, mythological creatures you don't see much in fiction. I just found it kind of flat and meh. So maybe I'm the wrong audience. It's probably just me.A Valkyrie in training finds out her Mom didn't kill her mark like she was supposed to and it has caused a chain reaction that basically culminates in an end of the world fiasco. Insert a romantic interest and a sort of love triangle (the main character is bisexual and her \"ex\" is the other side of the triangle). Insert the funny, loyal BFF and a cute pet. Insert a bit of Mean Girl vibe when main character is at magic school. I just don't think there is anything really new or spectacular going on with this one.

The series features a main character that is a Valkyrie in training who finds her whole world turned upside down from everything she has ever known.I will admit to picking this one up half based on the beautiful cover but also the fact that instead of the Vampires and Werewolves that seem to be everywhere in young adult fantasies it was about a Valkyrie and inspired by mythology. Not a subject you normally find to read about just dealing with that alone gave it a fresher feel than the next Vampire novel would have done.When starting off reading I found Malin to be somewhat unlikable with a rather brash personality but while getting to know her I thought she was perfectly done to fit a young Valkyrie and the background from which she came. She\u2019s one tough cookie and once getting into the story more I actually did end up liking her. I also quite liked a few of the other characters and all seemed to be well developed.I would warn with this comes a bit of a love triangle if those are something readers like to avoid. Malin meets a guy named Asher who starts her on her journey in the story but also involved is her ex-girlfriend. There are feelings for both involved but none of this bothered me at all and seemed to fit well in what we know about Malin herself and the journey she takes in self discovery and in her duties as a Valkyrie.Overall, I thought this was a great beginning to this new series and will definitely be interested in continuing on in the next book with an ending that definitely left room for more to come in the story. The series is fast paced and action packed which I always enjoy to keep the pages turning and hints at book two being even more so.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.wordpress...."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Marlin is a Valkyrie, born and raised to slay the immortals and return them to the underworld before they can wreck havoc in the world. But when Malin\u2019s mother fails to carry out a mission, and lets one of the immortal escape, she sets in motion a series of far reaching, life changing events that could change Malin\u2019s life forever. I was drawn to this initially because of the mythology and background. It\u2019s an interesting take on the Norse myths, told in a modern futuristic way, which I found unique. It\u2019s also a quick read, wih a consistent pacing filed with plenty of action and fighting that made it really easy to read. I do think it helped that I\u2019d read up on some Norse myths before I started this however, as I found a lot of the background information isn\u2019t really explained well and at times it could have got a little confusing. Sometimes the plot itself was also a little all over the place, bouncing from one area or character to the next, without any clear idea of where it was going to end up. It really could have done with some more coherency, and tightening up of the text. I also didn\u2019t really feel any connection with the characters. They were overly simplistic, with little depth to them. I think the characters really suffered because of the short length of the story, and they had little chance to develop beyond the one dimensional. I also didn\u2019t really see much of a relationship between Malin and her friends and lovers (although I loved the fact that she was bisexual), and I disliked the love triangle element. I found it slightly cliched, and harked back to more stereotypical and unoriginal YA fiction. The premise for this is wonderfully unique, but ultimately I felt that it failed to deliver on some key points, which was a shame."}, {"userName": "Joshua Gabriel (\uc870\uc218\uc544)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8832758-joshua-gabriel", "userReview": "I reviewed this book as a participant in a blog tour hosted by the publisher. Thank you, Wednesday Books, for sending me an e-galley and a finished copy.My written interview with Amanda Hocking can be found here.Did I choose to be a Valkyrie, or did it choose me?Being a fan of Valkyrie Profile, I was very excited to delve into Between the Blade and the Heart, Amanda Hocking's new novel about a teenage girl tasked by Odin to gather the souls (kill) of chosen individuals. After reading the first few chapters, I felt like I was devouring a revamped version of City of Bones. The setting was dark and urban, filled with creatures that were angelic, demonic, and something in between. Intrigued by the book's great premise and familiar world, I was able to fly through each short chapter.Essentially, this book had a strong beginning but lackluster ending. As a result, I had a hard time sorting through my conflicted feelings. Thankfully, this book had strengths that prevented me from giving it a lower rating. For example, most of the characters were diverse; there were many people of color, and the heroine's bisexuality wasn't such an issue in her society. Moreover, there was an emphasis on female empowerment; it was impossible for males to be Valkyries. Gender equality obviously wasn't shown, but it was nice that the female characters deviated from stereotypical weakness. Finally, the author's application of Norse mythology was concise and excellent. I particularly loved learning about the history of Valkyries and the gods that governed mortals and immortals.Romance was the thing that nearly ruined my overall enjoyment. The love triangle was refreshing since it involved a straight dude, a bisexual girl, and a lesbian. After all, queer love triangles are rarely seen in YA. However, I really disliked how Malin always compared Asher and Quinn. Her comparisons made Quinn (who was lesbian) seem inferior to Asher (who was straight). In spite of that, Malin couldn't make up her mind. She claimed that there were more important issues to deal with than her complicated love life. I understood the urgency of her world's destruction, but I couldn't help but wince at her insensitivity. Asher was my favorite character, and I was annoyed that Malin was inadvertently toying with his feelings.In the end, I decided to give Between the Blade and the Heart 3.5 stars because for the most part, it was fast-paced and entertaining. Its premise made it one of the most unique books in my library. Regardless of its flaws, I look forward to reading more books by Amanda Hocking. ^^"}, {"userName": "Jasmine from How Useful It Is", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4467515-jasmine-from-how-useful-it-is", "userReview": "BETWEEN THE BLADE AND THE HEART REVIEW \u2013 BLOG TOUR & GIVEAWAY (Giveaway rules: 1 usa winner only, finished paperback copy, ends 1/20/18 midnight \u2013 Rt&follow my twitter @howusefulitis to win).About: Between the Blade and the Heart is a young adult fantasy written by Amanda Hocking. It will be published on 1/2/18 by Wednesday Books, an imprint of St. Martin\u2019s Press, 336 pages. The genres are young adult, fantasy, mythology, and fiction. This book is intended for readers ages 12 to 18. This is book one to a duology.My Experience: I started reading Between the Blade and the Heart on 12/9/17 and finished it on 12/18/17. This book is a great read! It\u2019s my second Norse Mythology inspired read after Beyond a Darkened Shore. I\u2019m still not too thrilled with this Norse mythology because there are so many terms for names, places, and things I can\u2019t pronounce and so many demons/gods/in-between I\u2019m not so inclined to get to know. Other than that, I enjoy the story and I like following Malin\u2019s adventures. I like that Malin is independent and in control of herself. I like the way the story is moving, it is like a little puzzle that lead forward from one step to another.This book is told in the first person point of view, following Malin Krigare, 19, a Valkyrie with the responsibility to execute immortals and return them to the underworld. The reason to kill off the immortals is because there isn\u2019t enough space for everyone on earth. In this new world where immortals and mortals co-exists and if the immortals are left to live forever then the earth will be over capacity. Malin\u2019s mother, Marlow, also is an immortal executioner. As a Valkyrie, she has more strengths than others and the vengeance for her death is even riskier because she\u2019s slaying other\u2019s loved ones. One day, Asher Varja give a surprised visit to Malin and wanted vengeance against Malin\u2019s mom, Marlow. Marlow didn\u2019t kill an immortal, who in turn becomes dangerous and killed Asher\u2019s mom. Now Malin and her mom have to help Asher chase down that immortal to get rid of him so that Asher can find closure, but more happened than what they bargained for.This book is well written and developed. I enjoy the humor. I actually enjoy the love triangle in this book, especially the awkward moments when the three are together. I like Oona, Malin\u2019s best friend/roommate and her ability with crystals. The romance is a bit quick for my liking, but it\u2019s hot and most definitely with Asher. I like the mentions of how we are only pawns in the games of the gods. I can\u2019t imagine human living among demons and other less humanoids. My goose bumps set itself free just thinking about it. This book is an interesting read and there were hardly any dull moments. I highly recommend everyone to read it.Pro: humor, diversity, fast paced, love triangle, actions and adventures, a lot going onCon: probably just me but those places, names, and things are super difficult to pronounceI rate it 4.5 stars!***Disclaimer: Many thanks to the author Amanda Hocking, publisher St. Martin\u2019s Press, and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review.

To fail in their duties would cause catastrophic consequences. Welcome to Malin\u2019s world, a world of strict rules, duty and no time for emotional connections, at least Malin was always told by her cold mother that Valkyries couldn\u2019t love, but is Malin discovering that isn\u2019t quite true? Will Malin also discover that the one Valkyrie she thought would never fail at her duty had done just that and now it was up to her to right the wrong that had been done so long ago? Was that one indiscretion really a \u201cwrong\u201d to begin with? A Valkyrie\u2019s duty is to deliver those chosen for death, not to question if it is wrong or right, not to judge for themselves\u2026but one Valkyrie did just that, and the fallout has truly been horrendous.The balance of the world now lay at Malin\u2019s feet as she prepares to make things right with a ragtag group of friends, an old lover, a possible new lover and one powerful immortal who doesn\u2019t want to go to the underworld. BETWEEN THE BLADE AND THE HEART by Amanda Hocking is fast-paced tale of a young Valkyrie-in-training who discovers her mother and mentor may not be the person she thought she was and the fallout has become a web of tangled lies, lives and loves that could all be gone in an instant.

The story takes place in an alternate world where humans and immortals (demons, ogres, vampires etc.) co-exist. And there exists another group, the Valkyries, who were chosen by the gods to play grim reaper to the immortals. The book puts into question the idea of destiny or pre-determined fate versus our free will to choose. If one decision can change the course of history, is that because it was always meant to happen or because that very action went against the greater plan? Thus altering its course. A rather interesting question really. And one that we continue to question from beginning to end. Overall, the book was well-paced and overall decently written, though with this being an ARC there were some obvious errors here and there. But I am certain those will all be fixed in the final edition. I do wish there was a little more world-building, however, there was certainly enough for me to grasp the overall setting of the story.  The Cast  Malin is a smart, stubborn, kick-ass Valkyrie, with some rather serious emotional issues. Her childhood was not a normal one, growing up with her mother, a fellow Valkyrie, who taught her daughter survival, but rarely showed her love. Asher is the son of a fallen Valkyrie out to avenge his mother. He is strong, kind, patient and honestly just a precious cinnamon roll. Quinn is Malin's ex-girlfriend and a fellow Valkyrie. She is beautiful, relentless, caring and overall a sweetheart. And unlike what the synopsis might lead to believe she fighting for the same side as Malin and Asher, even if there may a conflict in terms of their relationships with Malin. Oona, Malin's best friend and a witch in training, is intelligent, hardworking, caring and loveable. She is honestly, the sort of ride-or-die best friend everyone needs.  The Relationships  So I guess I should warn those with an aversion to love triangles that there is somewhat of a love triangle in play here.  Quinn & Malin  These two dated a while back, and as we're told it is hot, intense and consuming until of course, Malin breaks it off. Malin admits that Quinn made her feel great, she also knowledges that Quinn, at many times, was too much. Demanded too much of her, wanted more than she was willing to give and that often times after being with Quinn she felt drained. While they do share a few intense moments and a few kisses throughout the book, it honestly felt that this relationship belonged in the past. And though Malin wasn't fully aware of her feelings, for the most part, I believe she felt the same way.  Asher & Malin  Their first meeting was, of course, a little rocky, given that Asher broke into Malin's apartment in search of her mother, who was indirectly responsible for the murder of his mother. But after coming to an understanding, these two become fast friends. And then, they develop into something more. Malin is someone who always seems ready to run, to hightail it out of a complicated situation and push people away. But with Asher, it is different, because, in addition to being kind, he is always very patient with Malin. He doesn't ask anything of her that she herself isn't willing to give. He is always there, to support and protect her if she needs it. Even though he knows Malin is fully capable of taking care of herself. With Asher, it seems Malin is willing to lay down her armor, if only a little, and at her most vulnerable, he makes her feel safe. *More detailed review to come*"}, {"userName": "Elise (On The Bookshelves)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51163760-elise-on-the-bookshelves", "userReview": "An easy and fast-paced read! Still maybe a 2 or 2.5 out of 5 though?This wasn't something I'd go out and buy, it just happened to be the cheapest book at the airport that I was most interested in. That being said, I was pretty excited by the idea of Norse mythology being present in this book, and it certainly was interesting throughout the novel.Nineteen-year-old Malin is a Valkyrie and she returns immortals to the afterlife when the higher ups decide it is time for them to move on. She's not fully qualified so her mentor/mother Marlow oversees her kills, while Malin also attends a school to learn more about immortals, beasts, hierarchy etc. She's bisexual\u2014there's her mostly ex girlfriend Quinn, her occasional bed buddy Jude, and then there's Asher, the son of a Valkyrie who winds up hunting her down as Malin's mother killed his mother.Essentially the premise of the story is that Malin's mother didn't kill an immortal and that immortal supposedly killed Asher's mother so it's her fault. He doesn't want revenge, but more so answers. However, everyone near Malin becomes involved in trying to right her mother's wrongs.The writing style felt quite simple and I know I am nit-picking but this book was also riddled with errors when it came to sentence structure, grammar and spelling. I'm not miss perfect when it comes to writing, but it's super distracting when there's something every few pages. The chapters are also incredibly short and in a way, it makes you feel like you're flying through the book because there's like 60 chapters in a book that's only 400 pages long.The characters were quite one-dimensional causing me to have difficulty to connect with them and it seemed we were given the minimum background for each character. It was also annoying that Malin carries this idea around that Valkyrie's can't love because that's what her mother told her, so she often jumps around between the three love interests. There were a lot of things that didn't get brought up again such as Marlow going on about how Malin should have been able to withstand some kind of poison because of Valkyrie heritage. I thought perhaps we might find out that there's something different about her towards the end of the book as a big reveal, but nada.The big battle was pretty sub-par as I love an epic showdown, but this one was like two pages. The ending was quite obvious as we had a crow flying around throughout the book and if you know Norse mythology, you know what that means. However, it may still interest me enough to see what happens in the next book. Perhaps if I don't have to pay for the book though.Lastly, I know YA is quite broad and this book isn't overly risque, but there's some steamy scenes so I'm not entirely sure if it'd be suitable for younger readers. But then again, I would have totally read it at the age of 12 because nobody screened my books.Anyway, if you're looking for something to quickly read, or something with loads of romance but still fantasy, this book is for you!P.S - Everyone has different views on books so just because I didn't enjoy it enough to give it five stars doesn't mean you won't!"}, {"userName": "Glen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20069595-glen", "userReview": "I won an ARC of this book in a goodreads drawing.Sort of Buffy the Vampire Slayer with a Norse Mythology angle.

All thoughts and opinions are entirely my own. I HAVE THOUGHTS. SO SO MANY THOUGHTS.I hadn\u2019t heard about Between the Blade and the Heart until a lovely publicist from St. Martin\u2019s Press pitched me the book as a part of a Blog Tour invite and the minute I read the word Valkyrie, I WAS SOLD.If you haven\u2019t seen me tweeting UNENDINGLY about just how brilliant Thor: Ragnarok was, YOU DON\u2019T KNOW ME. I have seen that movie THREE TIMES in theatres, and I would\u2019ve been there a fourth time if they hadn\u2019t taken it off screens. If you have seen the movie, you\u2019ll know that one of the main characters is a part of an ELITE FEMALE WARRIOR ARMY, the Valkyrie.And so, \nI went into Between the Blade and the Heart with HIGH expectations.\n As I actually read the book, I found that each thing I loved also had an aspect that I didn\u2019t like, which feels as confusing as it sounds, but let\u2019s break it down:1. THE MYTHOLOGY:  As soon as I heard that this book was about a Valkyrie, I assumed that it would be filled with Norse mythology. And yet, there were so many OTHER cultures coming into play, including Indian, Sumerian and Indonesian. While I LOVED the diversity, I feel like if the book acknowledged all the different cultures, I would\u2019ve enjoyed it more, instead of feeling like I was reading about X culture and an intruder Y showing up.2. THE CREATURES: This book was FILLED with paranormal/ supernatural and mythical creatures ranging from fallen angels to vampires. While these are some of the well-known creatures, there were SO MANY MINOR MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURES THAT I\u2019D NEVER HEARD OF, and it resulted in me DESPERATELY wishing for a glossary and reaching for the dictionary. I loved the fact that they were there, but it resulted in me being one CONFUSED reader.3. THE WORLD BUILDING: In relation to what I just wrote above, what I was expecting was Norse Mythology (most of my knowledge comes from the Thor movies) but I was drop-kicked into a world where paranormal and mythical creatures lived side by side, there was advanced technology, schools for children of mythical creatures and I just NEEDED a foreword or some kind of introduction before I was thrown into the deep end. Of course, it all made sense as I read on but STILL.4. THE LOVE INTERESTS: I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THAT MALIN, OUR VALKYRIE MC WAS BISEXUAL and I loved that there were male and female love interests. It made this book so much more interesting because YAY for diversity. HOWEVER, I am NOT A BIG FAN of love triangles (well, more of a love square/ flowchart) with one minor and two major love interests. It made me groan, because didn\u2019t we all get over love triangles/ squares/ flowcharts after Twilight?5. THE ENDING: I LOVED THE ENDING SCENE OF THIS BOOK. I made me flail in excitement and scream out loud and just that ONE scene has me so excited about what is to come next!Will I be picking up the next book? YES. That ending was fodder for my fangirl heart.Between the Blade and the Heart was a diverse book filled with mythology and I\u2019d definitely recommend digging in, even if it has its flaws! 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Crazy4Books", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16445884-crazy4books", "userReview": "In Between the Blade and the Heart\u00a0we follow Mal, a Valkyrie who returns immortals to the afterlife by slaying them to keep the balance of the world from being thrown into chaos. After Malin discovers that her mother spared the life of an immortal who was destined to die she struggles\u00a0with the knowledge that her mother might not be who she thought. Now she has to figure out how to fix her mothers mistake before the immortal sends the world crashing down around them.Mal is\u00a0a strong and determined character, but she definitely has some issues because of the way her mother raised her.\u00a0The family dynamics between the\u00a0two of them was heartbreaking.

I also liked Asher and Quinn. They both have distinct personalities and qualities that made them likeable, but Im not sure how I feel about the love triangle.\u00a0I loved all the diversity and reading about bi character, but we dont all have feelings for both guys and girls at the same time. Im not saying it doesnt happen, but spreading that stereotype does us a huge disservice. Enough people seem to think that as it is.\u00a0Also it was kind of weird how Mal completely ignored the creepy thing her mom said and all the other signs she was given.I thought this was going to be your traditional urban fantasy, but it didnt really feel like one because the world had some futuristic elements to it, which I loved. I also loved all\u00a0the different creatures and Norse mythology. I would have liked a bit more information about the world, but this is the first book in a series and I understand the author didnt want to slow down the pace by adding all the world building at the same time.\u00a0The story gripped me from the start, but then the pace slowed down and the story slowly started losing my interest.*received for review consideration*"}, {"userName": "JenacideByBibliophile", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42974042-jenacidebybibliophile", "userReview": "Disclaimer: This book was sent to me by the publisher, St. Martin\u2019s Press, via NetGalley for an honest review. Opinion: A slaying female heroine, naughty immortals hell-bent (haha, pun) on staying alive, and long walks into the underworld. Suh-Woon.Kind of.A Valkyrie has the sole duty of returning immortals to the afterlife once their lives are up. As one of the feared and sometimes hated Valkyrie, Malin dedicates her life to her job. When given a target, Malin knows not to ask questions and to complete her task as quick and efficiently as possible; when your time is up, your time is up. As Malin trains alongside her mother and learns her ways, she proves that she is almost ready to go out on her own. But when a boy named Asher attacks Malin in her apartment, she learns that her mother may have let one of her targets go in the past\u2026and the repercussions involve the death of an innocent and the fate of their existence. Sounds like a killer fantasy tale of badass female fighters and demons, right? Well, it is. It\u2019s packed with action, has an INCREDIBLY strong female lead, a little romance, a little betrayal, and the ever-loving descent into the underworld. Though the author, Amanda Hocking, has laced this book with everything I love in a story, I still wasn\u2019t completely blown away. I was intrigued with the direction that it took, and it successfully pulled me in. I just didn\u2019t feel like I HAD to keep reading it. It didn\u2019t seem to flow as easily and naturally as the other works from Amanda, and it left me a little disappointed. Do not let that discourage you, because I am still giving this book a semi-positive review. I can honestly report that I did find enjoyment out of Between the Blade and the Heart, and I am still impressed with the idea and plot. I think my main concern was that I felt a lack of connection to the story and the characters. Malin is a fierce and insanely awesome main character, but I don\u2019t feel like I know her as well as I would have liked. For me, the character and world development didn\u2019t translate properly into something relatable. Obviously, it\u2019s hard to do that in a Fantasy story about creatures that don\u2019t exist. But making the reader feel like they could fall into this world with just a touch to the page is what makes a Fantasy story relatable, and I just wasn\u2019t feeling it with this one.I think my final opinion on Between the Blade and the Heart is \u201cEh okay, good...but not my favorite\u201d. Since this is a series, I probably won\u2019t go on to read book 2. BUT, there have been many a series to turn my opinions around in the second installment, so I will have to wait and see. Honestly guys, Amanda Hocking is one of my favorite authors, so I am a bit bummed out to be writing a not so stellar review for one of her works.

This is the second Amanda Hocking book I've read, and it's also the second time that I'm disappointed with the romance aspect of the story in her books (in case you wonder why I'm mentioning it first it's because I really like romance). The main character was a bisexual girl, and I was all for it until she was involved in one of the weirdest love triangles I've ever read, and it made me dislike all characters involved.The book feels a little slow, but the story is still great, and the writing is decent.

Everything just flowed so well and I absolutely devoured this!The story is an urban fantasy that mixes together many different mythologies but the main one mostly being Norse since the story revolves around Valkyries who were created to kill immortals. However, there are so many different supernatural creatures portrayed including your basic vampires, demons, and angels but we also get to see some more unique ones such as gorgons, aswangs, and jorogumos! I thought the world building, in this case, was fantastic it was fun seeing such a blend of supernatural beings! I did want a little more information and details on the world but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get more in the sequel.Apart from the world building, another aspect I really enjoyed was the pacing. This was an incredibly fast paced book, I was hooked right off the bat and all the way up until the end. The writing and dialogue flowed well and kept my interest, I\u2019ll definitely be checking out more of Hocking\u2019s books!There also wasn\u2019t any lack of action and twists, and be forewarned the book ends off with a pretty brutal cliffhanger!I also really enjoyed all of the characters and while I think they could have used a bit more development and complexity I still thought they were all a lot of fun.Malin, our MC, is a badass Valkyrie who is also smart and stubborn at times. I liked how feisty she is, however, at times I felt she could be a little\u2026.fickle since she seems to not really know what it is that she wants.Then there\u2019s Quinn, the ex-lover, and Asher the new guy and both are love interests. I liked both characters and I could easily see how Malin fell for both of them. Basically Quinn and Asher are both badasses as well.Speaking of badass\u2026.Malin\u2019s mother, Marlow, was also really badass. She\u2019s a fellow Valkyrie and is incredibly focused on her job and doesn\u2019t really open up ever, even with her own daughter. I kind of had a love/hate relationship with Marlow.There was also a strew of many other side characters that I loved as well such as Malin\u2019s best friend who is also a witch and her pet Wolpertinger (which is the most adorable thing ever).I wouldn\u2019t say I loved the romance in this book but I also didn\u2019t hate it either but there is a bisexual love triangle so there is that. There is a bit of insta love and there definitely is a love triangle, but as I mentioned I didn\u2019t mind it too much. Malin\u2019s attraction to both Quinn and Asher was believable as both characters could offer her something different, however, I don\u2019t think Quinn treated Malin the best though. I\u2019m here for Malin x Asher!What I Loved: World buildingFast paced, action packed plotUnique supernatural/mythological creaturesWhat I Didn\u2019t Love: Characters could have used a bit more developmentRomance was \u201cmeh\u201dI highly recommend checking this book out!

I was so happy that this book DELIVERED on the mythology and the powerful women! The Norse mythology in the novel was so interesting! It was obvious the author did a lot of research into the mythology, especially in regards to the female warriors called the Valkyrie. I know of the Valkyrie from some characters in other books and movies, but I felt like I didn't really KNOW much about the Valkyrie. This story really delved into the world of the Valkyrie women, and I loved every moment of it. Some of the other plotlines in this book were a bit weaker and slower in comparison to the Norse mythology. I would have like to have a stronger focus on just the mythology and world building in this book. Malin was the main character, and I will admit that she was a bit hard to warm up to at first. She felt brash, unfiltered, and unapologetic. Those strong personality traits were a lot to handle all at once when first being introduced to the character. However, I learned to really enjoy and admire her strong personality. Malin was a girl who could not be pushed around or told what to do. I liked that she was a girl who wasn't afraid to speak up and be just as dominant as any male character. #FemalePower. Malin also did have some growth throughout the story, and I liked how she became more mature and understanding as the story progressed. Malin was a bi-sexual character, which I ADORED. I love seeing different sexualities represented in YA novels, so I was over the moon excited that the main character was bi-sexual. There was some romance in this novel and it involved a bit of a love triangle. I notoriously hate love triangles, so it was a bit disappointing to see it presented at first. However, it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would! Overall, Between the Blade and the Heart was a fascinating and high stakes novel!

They filled the earth with every creature imaginable, from the smallest fish in the sea to the largest dragon in the sky.\nA fast-paced adventure that pulls heavily from Norse Mythology, Between the Blade and the Heart centers mostly around a 19 year-old Valkyrie named Malin and her struggle with not only finding her place in the world of mortals and immortals, but also her realization that it\u2019s possible to both love and hate at the same time, specifically when it comes to an emotionally unavailable mother who happens to be the only family Malin has. Marlow, Malin\u2019s mother, is Malin\u2019s only parent and she\u2019s never given any clues as to who Malin\u2019s father may be. Add to that, Malin is slowly but surely realizing that everything Marlow taught her may not have been entirely true, or even based on facts for that matter. Malin learns a dire secret pertaining to her mother and after the shock and the sting of betrayal wears off, she understands that what Marlow did may result in something akin to an apocalypse, leaving Malin and her few friends and allies to sort through her mother\u2019s mess. But it also begs the question: who is ultimately pulling the strings, and is everything actually shaped by preordained fate and destiny?\nI had been born with an urge to kill, a calling inside me that intensified as I became a teenager. Getting rid of immortals brought me immense pleasure, and I couldn\u2019t imagine ever giving it up.  It was a strange, cold thing to realize I was born to be a murderer.\nHocking created such a unique and interesting world in this first installment of her new Valkyrie duology, blending fantasy and mythology and a little sci-fi into one super-interesting tale led by fierce and fabulous female warriors. Not only that, but she also managed to create a main character that\u2019s both incredibly strong and vulnerable all at once. And while I know the two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, adding in a hefty dose of vulnerability made Malin a much more relatable character and showed that without weakness, strength is entirely useless. The secondary characters were also dimensional and well-balanced, and I loved the variety of obscure mythological creatures involved and the gods and goddesses that make a brief appearance. Although judging by the cliffhanger of an ending, I have a feeling that the gods will definitely be far more involved in the sequel. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve said it before, but it\u2019s bears repeating \u2014 I\u2019ve grown to adore love triangles and yes, this book has one. Only instead of the typical \u2018two hot guys vying for one girl\u2019, Malin is torn between one hot guy and one hot girl, who happens to be her ex-girlfriend. There are also plenty of conflicted feelings involved concerning these potential relationships, but it certainly doesn\u2019t pertain to Malin\u2019s sexuality. Malin is self-assured and incredibly certain and with her bisexuality, which I loved, and the feelings of conflict are instead coming from her mother\u2019s repeated words that Valkyrie\u2019s don\u2019t need to love, they relish and thrive on being alone, and as Malin is slowly realizing, everything Marlow taught her may not necessarily be true or even right. Malin has plenty of internal conflict and the majority is a direct result of her often emotionally unavailable mother and upbringing.\n\u201dI don\u2019t think I know how to have feelings, real ones like passion and anger and sadness and all that. Marlow always taught me that real Valkyries don\u2019t feel like that. That those emotions are just for humans. But I do feel them, and I always have, even when I tried not to.\u201d\nReminiscent of some of my favorite urban fantasy series and books, Between the Blade and the Heart definitely has a more mature feel to it, which will certainly appeal to both readers of YA and adult and everything in between. Highly recommend and I can\u2019t wait to see what Hocking brings readers in the next installment of this fast-paced and fierce series. *eARC received via NetGalley in exchange for my honest opinion."}], "description": "Between the Blade and the Heart is the first book in a brilliant new young adult fantasy duology inspired by Norse mythology by New York Times bestselling author Amanda Hocking.As one of Odin's Valkyries, Malin's greatest responsibility is to slay immortals and return them to the underworld.
