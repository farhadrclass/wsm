One for myself and a second one for my sister-in-law with the Bachelor of Science in Anthropology. SisterA and my brother were married when I was about 14 years old and I always remember her excitement whenever she went \"on a dig\". Then eight years later, I heard about this Bible and I knew it was the perfect gift for her. Now four years later, this Bible is still selling strong and there are so many different editions and versions of it available. You can easily find it in a hardcover edition like I have as well as European Leather, Bonded Leather, Top Grain Leather, Renaissance Fine Leather, and Italian Duo-Tone, all of which are available in a variety of colors. It's also available in Large Print. Truly you can find the right edition for anyone. There is even a Bible Cover made for it \"The Archaeological Bible Cover\" (Designed in a safari style, this cover is constructed from sturdy khaki woven material and features two exterior flap pockets, leather-look\u2122 trim and a spine handle.). This Bible is just a wealth of information and filled with incredible imagery. They got it right to call it \"an illustrated walk through Biblical history and culture\". A really cool thing that came with my version is a bonus CD-ROM that contains searchable NIV text and most of the photographs, maps and charts including within the pages of the print Bible. With my background of Religious Studies, this Bible reads like a fascinating text book to me. The kind that you would definitely not sell back to the book store at the end of your term. It does not matter how many times you pick up this Bible, every time there is something fantastic and new. This would be an incredible addition to any homeschooler's library or just any Bible student in general. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is very thick, and the only thing that I would change if I were to buy it again, is that I would buy a leatherbound edition. But all and all, I love it."}, {"userName": "Chandra", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/956488-chandra", "userReview": "this is my first study bible ever and i am loving it. i looked at a bunch of different ones in the store and this seemed to be a style i really liked. lots of info, history, facts, maps. it is so chock full of information, you don't get very far very fast! but it pulls in all the most recent archaeological info related to whatever you're reading. it's extremely interesting and i think gives a much broader and deeper understanding of what you're reading. the one thing i don't like so far is the design of bible. there is so much packed in there that the type is rather small. they've made the background of all the pages look like an aged parchment or something, which reduces the contrast with the type and makes it harder to read. i get the concept, but it's a little overdone. highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Kaara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1906185-kaara", "userReview": "I've never read the Bible--none of the New Testament, and in Sunday school I only learned stories of the Torah without any real first-hand reading of it. So a year or so ago I decided once and for all to buy the thing and read it. Have you ever tried to buy a Bible? Which version to choose, which version to choose. I've always been fascinated by the archeological and historical basis of the Bible, and I was a lot more comfortable buying and reading the Bible with an intellectualizing rationale in my head, plus this version is supposed to have plain language for contemporary times, so I choose this version. Here's part of how the introduction explains it: The role of Biblical archaeology as a hermeneutical tool is invaluable in situations in which cultural allusions and settings have in the past plainly alluded us--simply because the context belonged to another, completely \"foreign,\" place and time. (quotes theirs, and, yes, I had to look up \"hermeneutical\" too.)So as for the version, it provides some helpful maps of the ancient world and some interesting theories as to where key events occurred and what certain items, customs, and other elements looked like based on archaeological evidence. But mostly, the explanations of pottery, ruins, and the like end with an assertion to the effect of \"This proves that God was truly present\" or \"This proves that these holy acts really happened.\" Those assertions aren't convincing to me and are just sort of distracting--I don't see the connection they're making from scientific surmising to breathless reverence--but what would one expect from the authors, who are seminarians, and I do appreciate their dedication. And as far as the content itself, the Bible...well, I'm still only at the end of Exodus (after a year...er, it's slow going OK? And it's not really a book the size or nature of which I'd like to take on the train for commuter reading), but, so far, it honestly reads as something that is from a profoundly alien place. The norms conveyed are ones of violence, senselessness, deviousness, and hostility toward women, and I feel no connection whatsoever with such an inconsistent, cruel, violent, unpredictable, arbitrary deity. I'm trying to read more deeply to glean other insights from it, and I really want to understand the power this collection of stories holds for so many people, but so far...no dice. I'm wondering if the New Testament is where a lot of people connect because of the message of love and peace and whatnot. The Old Testament was never really known for its warm fuzzies. For this, I can't understand why Jewish folks and my own Jewish upbringing was so nonjudgmental and generous. It's certainly nothing the rabbis get from Genesis or Exodus, yeesh."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70756-heather", "userReview": "Although from my limited research, I would lean toward the ESV Bible, this is an incredible work.

Since that time my views have changed and I dislike the commentary. For example in Genesis evolution is immediately discussed, the commentary tells us that the bible allows for variations in \"kinds\" of animals but the bible doesn't allow for a species to evolve into a different one. I'm not too sure why this is mentioned here, but it quickly shows the authors bias and sets the tone for the entire commentary. You'll sometimes get mentions of scholarly opinion (for example the fact that many scholars question the Pauline authorship of the Pastorals), but this is only so they can counter argue these viewpoints with why the traditional fundamentalist view is more likely correct. Anyways I originally rated this 5 stars but reading parts again I'll have to lower my score. Note: the rating isn't related to the bible itself or the translation.--Original Review--I decided this year to read the bible again and I choose this one because of my interest in the ancient culture and archeology related to it. I actually really ended up liking the NIV version of the bible as well. This is the first bible that I\u2019ve actually read the all of the articles and study notes and it was well worth while. Especially helpful were the notes putting the prophets into context. This is ultimately somewhat conservative in its approach. It still points out things such as other Near Eastern Religious similarities but then it provided a defense as to why and how the bible is different. This might be confusing for a new Christian, but I think it\u2019s important that these questions are presented so they don\u2019t come as a shock later on, especially when done in a less apologetic fashion. My main complaints with this are that I really think this bible could benefit with 15-20 pages of articles from the intertestamental period to give a better introduction to the New Testament. Also the notes can be a little brief and a lot is left out (although due to the size of this already I can understand why). Overall this is a pretty great study bible and I\u2019d highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7892094-kristina", "userReview": "Chock full of cultural and historical notes, gorgeous photography, maps and tables, this bible is an excellent way to gain understanding of scripture that may otherwise entirely escape one's notice. It also adds insight to common misperceptions about many scriptures. One way this is done is put put things in perspective and remind the reader not to measure actions against today's standards, but the standards of the time it was written. Weights, measurements, monetary values are all explained in a way that allows the reader to translate and compare it to todays standards.A woman gives up or donates a bolt of purple fabric. Big deal right? You can get anything from burlap to silk on clearance in any fabric store. In biblical times, spices, fabrics, dyes and many other materials were precious commodities. Aside from purple being associated with royalty (an indication of social standing to even possess it), to give up a large bolt of purple is akin to your average J.C. Penney shopper giving up the one and only piece of Versace or Prada they have.A camel going through a needle? NOT going to happen. Again, there is information on architecture and mountain passes that will offer a broader insight as to what was meant by that scripture. A cracked jar? So what, toss it in the recycle bin. This bible gives insights to different types of containers, their importance in everyday life and the value of the craftsmen that produced them. This bible also offers arguments against widely held beliefs and doesn't insist on being \"right\" about everything. The Levitical portion demonstrates that very well by offering a history of speculations and educated guesses and calling them just that. When they don't know for sure, the say so. It cites resources and invites the reader to want to know more. Some may argue that it's not a five star bible. This body of work does not claim to be a study of Hebrew and Greek language, and it's not. It's a complete biblical text supported by Arcaeological research. I buy a new version of the bible every other year or so unless I see a good deal in a used book store. The next one will be specific to original language and text."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1635782-mike", "userReview": "I have a fair amount of skepticism for the barrage of specialized bibles that have been coming out lately. The apologetics bible, the reformation bible, and on and on. I thought we had enough of this crap already, the couple's devotional bible, the teen study bible, the soldier's bible, the chicken soup for the bible's soul edition, or whatever. Then I saw this new addition to a long list specialized bibles in my church library and checked it out. I have got to say I am pretty impressed. I honestly didn't think that there was enough archeological evidence surviving to fill the pages of the entirety of the bible. Clearly I was wrong. The editors creatively fill the pages of this Bible with pictures, factoids, and some pretty decent analysis of topics relevant to the biblical text. For example, I was curious about what one would put as archeological evidence for the book of genesis. I turned to the appropriate pages and was pleased to find other ancient near eastern literature, like what was the role of the serpent in other contemporary cultures at the time. Good stuff and enlightening. The pictures are fun as well, what did a roman centurion's helmet look like? Well there's a picture for ya! Other fun facts were present that I was surprised to find, for example, a LXX use in the NT. These are well written and accessible for everyone. I thought that such a bible wouldn't have a broad enough audience to be published but I had a pastor not long ago ask me for a place that he could go to to find quick and dirty archeological blurbs on biblical times, places and artifacts that he could use to liven up sermons. I listed some book off that I had dipped into and he thought they were generally too academic or detailed or not his tastes to be worth his time. I recommended this and he was pretty interested and found it helpful. That pastor and laypeople that are into this kind of thing are the choice audience for this bible. I am glad that it has graced the shelves of all major books stores."}, {"userName": "John Stinebaugh", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21293027-john-stinebaugh", "userReview": "This is an excellent resource that I'm sure I will refer back to often and is now my main paper copy of the Bible that I will use."}, {"userName": "Ebookwormy1", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1005834-ebookwormy1", "userReview": "I just received this Bible for Mother's Day.

I am thoroughly enjoying the insights into ancient culture, geography and history. I'm disappointed in the maps in the back, I was expecting a lot more in that regard. They appear to be the standard maps given with the NIV translation. I was hoping for more detail and more geographic insight, such as maps of excavation sites in the Middle East, possibly geographic representations of the location of major archeological finds in the past 50 years, a detailed map of the Israelite conquest (as opposed to just the land division once settled), the travels and miracles of Jesus, etc.That being said this is an excellent work of scholarship and the presentation (full color) has a high aesthetic appeal.
