I picked it up and thought ha, clever. A bit. The reason you are still reading this review is because of the title, right? A groaner, but you know, Coppola!This I learn is a sequel to Apocalypse Bow Bow (what follows, Cow Cow? Sow Sow?), which I am not going to go out of my way to read. Since it is a story that takes place after the apocalypse, it is kind of poking fun at all the dystopian fiction out there, a thing I like. It'a all animal characters: Silly Dog, Angry Dog, The Cop, The Kitty Cat. It's pretty funny, actually. Clever, a bit. But the story is just okay. On the other hand you can read it in like 90 seconds, so there's that."}, {"userName": "Heena Rathore P.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19253213-heena-rathore-p", "userReview": "Note: I received a copy of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I had a good laugh reading this comic and would definitely read the other books in the same series.The book started brilliantly and I adored all the dogs and the cat (meow.) I really enjoyed the quirkiness and the cuteness of the plot and the characters. I absolutely loved the whole thing about the \"Twonkies\" (with a capital T) and the nude dude. It's a funny book and that's what I was expecting from it, so it delivered what it promised and considering that it's a children's book, I can't expect anything more from it. Having said that, i did feel that the end could have been a little different or a page sooner.Originally I wanted to give this one a 5-star rating, but before I did I found out that the other books in this comic-series are far funnier than this one, so I thought of giving it a 4-star for now. If later, after reading the other books, I'll feel that it deserves an added star or half, then I'll definitely update my review. But for now I think 4-star rating is perfect.Aww... isin't he adorable <3"}, {"userName": "Rebecca Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4811272-rebecca-ann", "userReview": "My what a bizarre book. To me it really just felt like a weird dream that someone wrote down and had illustrated. While it was cute in a quirky way, it just didn't feel unique or insightful, or even hilarious. Although there is a naked dude in it, he is pictured in such a way that everything is hidden and it is just used for incongruity. The storyline follows a bunch of pets who have been separated from their owners because of the naked man's 'time machine\" and sent to an alternate dimension. They are simply trying to survive and find food, and accidentally challenge a lion to a duel over 'townies' (Twinkies). You can sum it all up with \"random and pointless\".This would work for the same audience as captain underpants"}, {"userName": "Etienne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11486904-etienne", "userReview": "Strange, but funny.

All humans have disappeared from Earth and only the pets are left, which means they\u2019re just waiting to get into wild adventures. And although they do have apocalyptic problems\u2013such as missing their people and running out of food\u2013the authors make sure things stay silly. As the pets go on a quest to eat all the Twonkies they could possibly want from the abandoned Twonkie factory, it is easy to imagine the owners are just at work or about to come back. Not to mention there are a few hints that someone might be trying to undo the apocalypse.I have to admit that this book is not really my style. Though I did find it amusing at times, it does not really align with my sense of humor. I am also not a huge fan of the loose, cartoony art style. However, the story is entertaining and the characters are pretty endearing. I have not read the prequel to the book, but had no trouble following the plot, understanding the characters, or otherwise comprehending what was going on in this world. The authors make enough allusions to past actions that it is possible to fill in the gaps of why some characters are distrustful of each other or make certain alliances with one another.Overall, then, Apocalypse Meow Meow is pretty entertaining. I can easily imagine this appealing to middle schoolers, particularly boys. There are only a few words on each page (and oftentimes they\u2019re words like \u201cmeow\u201d or \u201cgrr\u201d), so it\u2019s a pretty quick read, which may also make it a good choice for reluctant readers.Source: ARC from ALAAC15"}, {"userName": "Trisha Perry", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18046858-trisha-perry", "userReview": "This was a very cute graphic novel and a the second of the series. Even though it is cute and just a story about some animals trying to survive after a apocalypse there is more to the story if you look for it. In this book the dogs need to beat the large kitty to win the twonkies all for themselves and their friends. Can the dogs do it by themselves or will they need some help from their friends? This really is a good book and all the animals have such great personalities, the way some of them have banded together to survive this dreaded circumstance, especially for house pets. But I suggest you first read book one Apocalypse Bow Wow as some of the things in this book where a little confusing since I had not read the first one, but you can get the main story ok without the first book, there are just a few things that pop up that are strange without the first book. Still loved the book and thing you all will too."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7607436-emily", "userReview": "Written in scenes rather than chapters, this graphic novel by a father and son duo continues the Apocalypse series involving Angry Dog, Silly Dog, Cop, Tough Dog, and Kitty Cat. Angry Dog sees that a guy has appeared, even though it isn\u2019t \u201cour guy\u201d as Silly dog calls him. On their search to find the guy, they find Rat who leads them to a Twonkies Factory with enough food to quench their hungry selves. But--something is in their way in the Factory. Will Angry Dog be successful? Will they come up with a valid Plan B that will thwart the Lion lurking there? This graphic novel is perfect for either primary readers, or a great high interest, low level title for older students. Great for classroom and school libraries that just need some updating."}, {"userName": "Kristina Aziz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3141653-kristina-aziz", "userReview": "I got this book as an e-arc through NetGalley, so any formatting opinions are self-redacted.First, the drawings: they were cute without being too childish, and fit the tone of the story well.The story: was really adorable and I can see grade school readers loving this series. The ending felt a little cut off though, like this originally was a longer piece that got chopped in half. Although, for the second in a series, you'd never know it. It reads like the first of a series and there's a thing that is introduced but never explored or resolved that felt off.Buyability: not for me. My daughter's too young yet for me to know if she would like it.Overall: This is a great book to have in a school library, but the cliffhanger at the end means you'll probably want to get the series."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1500112-jennifer", "userReview": "I am not a cat person and thought I would hate this sequel to Apocalypse Bow Wow.
