I do not know that this is actually an amazing book, but dammit, it was entertaining. Honestly, I pretty much hated Cinder when I finally forced myself through it last year. It was a 1-star, ranty hate at all the wasted potential and - worst of all - tediousness. But so many commenters told me to read Scarlet anyway. At first, I wasn't going to. Seems kind of stupid to read the sequel to a book you disliked so much, right? But, somehow, over time, my curiosity got the better of me. And hell, I just had so much fun reading this. I think Scarlet is a much more interesting and less bland character than Cinder, and her introduction to the story actually contributed to making Cinder and her story more exciting. The big twist in this book is easy to guess, but it is surrounded by little mysteries and surprises that I never expected, keeping the pace at breakneck speed.I love the girl power, the emphasis put on Scarlet's love for her grandmother, and even the romance. Unlike with Cinder and Kai (who I also had way more sympathy for in this book!), I enjoyed the arc of this relationship and found myself curious where it would lead. And there's something about a sexy wolf that just does it for me. Maybe I have problems.So strange how much more I liked this sequel. It still feels very much like a light, YA sci-fi and yet the fire in this book makes the pages fly by and the characters appeal to me. We are starting to get answers to bigger questions and I'm looking forward to seeing what else Meyer has up her sleeve.I also can't wait to get to Fairest because Levana is a raging bitch and I want to know why!Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Jesse (JesseTheReader)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8114361-jesse-jessethereader", "userReview": "(more of a 3.5)I really enjoyed this installment in the Lunar Chronicles, but I didn't think it was as good as Cinder. I was annoyed reading about Scarlet throughout this book. We really didn't get to know her, we only saw her concerned about her grandmother and wolf. I did love the sections that were focused on Cinder though! I also really liked how the two story lines came together.

Dur. I didn\u2019t take it well, let\u2019s say, because that meant the hundreds and hundreds hyped sci-fi books out there would most likely not appeal to me either. I know that not every genre can work for everyone, but it\u2019s always unfortunate to learn something like this. I just realized how dramatic my confession must have sounded, but I can\u2019t help it if that\u2019s how I felt at that time.But, the thing is, after reading Cinder, Scarlet and some of their short stories and LOVING all of them \u2013 Scarlet the most however \u2013 I realized that, in the book world too, it is not exclusively black or white. There are shades, exceptions. And thank god, because starting this series literally made me realize how there are certainly some other books of this genre out there that I might enjoy as well. Seeking them doesn\u2019t hurt. Now that this \u2018\u2018problem\u2019\u2019 has been resolved, I shall start working my way to \u2013 at least \u2013 tolerating horror reads, heh.Why I preferred this sequel to the first book is probably due to the fact that this continuation to the Lunar Chronicles series contained multiple POVs, unlike Cinder did, of what I remember. We had Cinder\u2019s \u2013 of course, Scarlet\u2019s, Kai\u2019s, Captain Thorne\u2019s and even one chapter from Queen Levana\u2019s point of view. With so many different events, plunging into a state of boredom was something impossible to achieve. But no one\u2019s complaining, *wink* *wink*. Something else that appealed to me was the (swoon-worthy, handsome, charming, unforgettable\u2026) male leads. I know Prince Kai was wonderful \u2013 even though a little too simple and banal, prince status aside \u2013 in book one, but I definitely saw a second side of him, more mature and serious and loyal in this read. If I wasn\u2019t convinced before, now I absolutely agree that he would make a great and honest leader that will only grow and rule with kindness and as much fairness as possible.The only thing that could have been different is Scarlet and Wolf\u2019s love for each other. It did take time before they warmed up to one another, but, when they did, their sentiments did not gradually evolve from that point. In the contrary, like a rocket, it is as if whatever sparkled could not be controlled and, well, it did not feel realistic. Although, I can understand, this being a fairytale retelling, that some elements were rather embellished to a magical and dreamy point. On purpose or not, that I do not know.Nonetheless, Scarlet deserves every single star I gave it!"}, {"userName": "Sarah Maas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2503402-sarah-maas", "userReview": "Even better than CINDER!

Her favorite was Red Riding Hood, and she knew this story by heart since she was 2-years-old (everyone thought that this was a sign of her intelligence but in my opinion it was a warning. A warning that she'd never shup up). The girl grew up and decided to become a lawyer (so that people would pay her to talk non-stop) and she came across a horrible, horrible dilemma: she had to choose between what she \nhad\n to do and what she \nwanted\n to do. She had to study, she had to finish her incredibly boring/difficult essay and being a perfectionist she barely had enough time to sleep, let alone read. But she wanted to read, to get lost inside her books, to travel in faraway lands and witness the upcoming war between Earth and Luna. In a desperate effort to balance her life goals, she stayed up all night to finish Scarlet so that there wouldn't be any distractions from her studies.Pathetic excuse, I know. She read it because Marissa Meyer had the wondeful ability to make her forget her fears, her insecurities and worries and instead she introduced her to a world where Cinderella was a cyborg and a fugitive who tried to come to terms with the revelations that changed her life, where the Big Bad Wolf was a boy that tried to control his bloodlust and questioned the way he was raised, where Little Red was a feisty girl who would do anything to save her grandmother and smugglers were extremely hot.\n\n\u201cShe did not know that the wolf was a wicked sort of animal, and she was not afraid of him.\u201d\n\nRina found Scarlet's story extremely addictive! She was not the heroine she expected her to be. She was brave, stubborn, hot-headed and always ready for a fight, she was the little sister Hulk never had! Rina followed her quest wide-eyed and eager for adventures, secrets and romance because stars above! Scarlet's dynamic with Wolf made her feel fuzzy and giddy and warm inside! It took her a while to trust Wolf, but she couldn't resist the urge to hug him and cuddle him and make him her personal teddy bear!\n\n\u201cI think I realized that I would rather die because I betrayed them, than live because I betrayed you.\u201d\n\nSee? Sweeter than milk chocolate! But his savage and wild side was also intriguing and kind of hot! Rina could not predict his secrets and the reasons he acted this way, he hurt her many times but she always forgave him! But Wolf wasn't the only adorable male character in Scarlet. There was also Kai and his difficult decisions that almost made her weep. And there was Thorne. Captain Thorne. A blend of Disney's Flynn Rider, Han Solo and Dean Winchester.Yummy! Such a hilarious character that could not stop talking (a sign from the Universe that he should marry Rina), self-centered and charming and loyal... just great! His interactions with Cinder? \nBrotp alert!\n Cinder was more likeable when she was next to him and wanted to smack his head!\n\n\u201cA captain always knows where his ship is. It's like a psychic bond.\u201d\u201cIf only we had a captain here.\u201d\n\nWhen a book features an \nawesome gang, chaos, war, prison breaks, evil monarchs, bloodthirsty beasts, fights and psychic powers, it's impossible not to love it\n! And bleary-eyed, disoriented and sleepy Rina was no exception!P.S.

This review probably won't make sense, and I'm probably leaving a shit ton out, but here goes. I was lucky to score an advanced copy of Scarlet from Marissa Meyer while at Comic Con.Totally me.I was in the middle of another book which I quickly finished in order to start this. So, Cinder left us with our heroine basically on the run after finding out that she was Princess Selene. Scarlet opens by introducing us to the new character in this universe, aptly named Scarlet who is looking for her missing Grandmother and along the way meets a mysterious guy who goes by Wolf. The book started off a little slow for me. I, like I'm sure most will be, was more concerned with what was happening with Cinder and Prince Kai than I was with Scarlet and her journey. But Meyer's storytelling would not let that be, and I found myself eagerly enjoying Scarlet's feisty personality while also searching for how Scarlet would come to meet Cinder. How could these two completely different characters come together? How are their pasts joined?Well, let me tell you, the answer is pure genius. Meyer has created such a deep, complex story that when you find out how Scarlet and Cinder are connected, you're just like, whoa. Along with the flawless backstory, Scarlet introduces us to two more characters besides Scarlet herself: Wolf and Thorne. I really hope we see more of them in the final 2 books. And just as in Cinder with the classic Cinderella losing the glass slipper, Meyer's use of the the famed Red Riding Hood scene is flawless. I love the way she just weaves in the fairy tales but makes it work for the plot.Another thing I love about about Meyer's writing, is there's a point in her books that you hit where you suddenly can't put it down. You have to finish it! My point was when Scarlet and Wolf arrive in Paris and I sat on my couch reading like a madwoman until I finished. Now...WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW MARISSA???? THAT WAS NOT AN ENDING??? WHAT WILL CINDER DO NOW? WHAT ABOUT KAI AND HIS ANNOUNCEMENT AT THE END?I wanted this book so bad...so bad!! But now that I have it, I have to wait that much longer for the third one. WHY???????Sigh...I will wait...rather impatiently for 2014 to get here.Just one final note: Prince Kai, no matter what happens:Truth"}, {"userName": "Steph Sinclair", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4642710-steph-sinclair", "userReview": "I have to give it to Ms. Meyer for one again combining your favorite fairy tales with sic-fi/fantasy. Seriously, well done! The Lunar Chronicles is quickly becoming one of my new favorite series and for good reason. It has kick-ass protagonists like Cinder and now Scarlet. When we first met Cinder in book one, she was shy and timid, eventually coming into her own strength. And when I heard that we would be introduced to a new main character, I was a little nervous. I was worried that I'd end up comparing the two and dislike Scarlet. But let me tell you! When Cinder was unsure of herself in the beginning, Scarlet is fierce. Who's afraid of the Big, Bad Wolf? Not Scarlet.I should warn you that this review *will* contain spoilers for Cinder. So, if you haven't read book one...\nScarlet picks up directly after Cinder left off. Cinder's busy breaking out of jail, Kai is trying to placate Levana (the wretch) and we get to meet Scarlet (yay!). And if you can't remember the finer details about what happened previously, there is a nice little recap.The biggest difference between this installment and Cinder is the point-of-view flipping. And with that, you have two different main characters with two separate goals. Scarlet's is to find her missing grandmother, who was abducted and Cinder's is to escape from the Eastern Commonwealth and... not get caught. Somewhere along the way their paths intertwine and revelations are had. Now, here's the thing: Though, overall, I did enjoy Scarlet, there are still a few things I really disliked about it too. Don't give me that look! There is method to my madness.Things I liked:1. The new characters\u00a0- Along with meeting Scarlet, we also are introduced to two other characters, the wolf, who travels to Paris with Scarlet in search of her grandmother and Carswell Thorne, a womanizer and fugitive that escaped prison with Cinder. I thought they were both great characters, especially Thorne, who I happen to love and hate at the same time. Wolf is a bit more complex because of his past (which I can't talk about due le spoilers), but I like the mystery surrounding his character.Scarlet is fantastic. I mean, the girl wears a red hoodie and carries a gun in her belt. Sweet and innocent? *pfft* How about sweet and deadly?\n\n\nShe's all about action and doesn't take \"no\" for an answer. She doesn't sit back and wait for someone else to save her grandmother. And I think the best way to describe her would be to quote Ms. Frizzle from The Magic School Bus: \"Take chances, make mistakes and get messy!\" So, while she isn't a perfect character, she certainly is determined to do whatever it takes to reach her goal. I loved that about her and I think other readers will too or at least respect her spirit.2. I also really enjoyed the plot and back story. We get to find out more about Cinder's past and how she ended up ended up on earth and who helped her. I really think Meyer did a good job at telling two different stories and later having them weave together. And I really like seeing Scarlet and Cinder together. I only wish that they had teamed up sooner than the ending.Things I didn't like:1. At times it felt like there was too much story to tell. (Maybe this was just me wanting more from Scarlet.)\u00a0Even though\u00a0Scarlet\u00a0is longer than\u00a0Cinder,\u00a0I'd even say that I think that there was too much happening in this installment and not enough time spent developing the new characters or the new relationships, which, incidentally, leads to my next con...2. I'm not sure I liked Scarlet and Wolf's relationship. Since the novel very frequently flips back and forth from Scarlet to Cinder and even Kai, there wasn't much page time the reader is left developing some kind of connection with their relationship. Actually, they themselves didn't even have much time developing anything and by the end, I found it all rather cheesy. And while they do both admit that they've developed feelings for one another (in a matter of days), it never felt real because I was too busy keeping up with all the story arcs.3. I missed Kai and Cinder being together. Kai is in the book, but I missed the chemistry they had in Cinder.\u00a0I think Wolf and Scarlet's romance was supposed to fill the void temporarily, but since I didn't really spend much time with them, the sparks never flew for me. Perhaps in book three, Cress, things will be different. But right now, I have my doubts considering it looks like we will be meeting even more characters. I'm starting to wonder if this world is just too big for this series. Ah, well. We'll see.The Ending:'Cause, yeah, it needs its own section.Kai. WHY?! WHY? WHY? WHY?\nOkay. I think I need a moment to process that ending.\u00a0*breathes in and out*Did that just make you want to read this book even more than you already did? Oops.So, in conclusion, even though I liked Cinder more, Scarlet was still a fun and exciting read. Meyer has built an interesting world, making \"old faces\" from fairy tales new again. And I know you're probably giving me dagger eyes for the little bit above, but just think how hard it will be for me to wait for Cress.\u00a0It's torture, I tell ya.ARC was provided by Macmillan.

However Scarlet the second book in The Lunar Chronicles has made me think again. I honestly really liked this book, I liked the new characters. I can't even decide between Scarlet, Wolf and Thorne because they al bring something different to the plot.The building of the story progressed really well, I was curious as to how these two stories would entwine, but it was apparent quite early(ish) on. I thought it was really clever how they described Scarlet, with the Red Hoody, her companion is wolf and when she went to watch a fight they were called Hunter. Little attention to detail like this made me really happy and just think of the story that this once was.I honestly think I preferred Scarlet and Wolfs story rather than Cinder and Thornes, although later on in the later chapters I did enjoy this. Thorne was an added bonus to the story, I always like some form of light heartedness and that comes perfectly with this cheeky character.I'm looking forward to continuing on with he series, the ending of this book has set up the next book perfectly.Wolf are you...going to ask me to be you alpha female?Swoooooooon, Swoon, Swoon.Wolf is my fave, there I said it.Reviews:Cinder- 4Scarlet- 4.5 Cress- 4.5 Winter - 5"}, {"userName": "Reynita Maharani \u2605 The Night Reader \u2605", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43850323-reynita-maharani-the-night-reader", "userReview": "[after i found out that Wolf, at first had the intention of betraying her,i cried so much on my pillow until my pillow was soaked with my tears, i actually already suspected his intention of betraying Scarlet but i never believed it.

I bought this book the week it came out but forced myself to wait because I didn't want to plow through and then face the agonizing one-year wait before the next one.Ye-ah, that self-imposed wait did not last very long.And now that I\u2019ve finished Scarlet, you have NO idea how hard it is to write a coherent review when all I want to do is flail my arms and fangirl about the book. Because it. Was. SO GOOD.In this retelling, Scarlet (our Little Red) has traded in her cape for a functional hoodie and her basket of goodies for a handgun. One that she is not afraid to use, I might add. This girl is a badass. Not to mention tough and stubbornly determined to find her grandmother, no matter who stood in her way. I found Scarlet to be a tougher and more fiery character than Cinder, and I ended up loving her just as much. And speaking of characters that I loved....Wolf. What can I say about Wolf exceptHe's definitely not what I expected of a Big Bad Wolf incarnation. He was... shy. And quiet. And very adorable. Well. When he's not being an deadly fighter, that is. I can't even find the words to describe him because all I want to do when I think about Wolf is(I'd highly recommend reading The Queen's Army before Scarlet because it's going to provide a lot more back story to Wolf's character.)Cinder's adventure is continued in this book and picks up soon after her arrest at the Ball. She manages to escape from prison with the unlikely help from a fellow prisoner, one Captain Carswell Thorne, flirtatious American pilot. Thorne provided some much appreciated comic relief throughout the story, and OH MY GOODNESS, you guys, I am 95% sure he's going to be the love interest featured in the next book! *Squeeeeeee* >___<As interested as I was by Scarlet's story, I was still riveted by Cinder's journey. Slowly, she is learning more about her newfound Lunar abilities as well as her past as Princess Selene. Watching Cinder explore her Lunar gift was awesome. I think it'll only be a matter of time before Queen Levana should head for the hills! (Fingers crossed).Kai's story is continued in Scarlet as well. There weren't enough scenes to fully satisfy my Kai cravings (and don't even get me started on how much it's killing me that he and Cinder are not together!!) but there were just enough moments to keep me appeased. In the glimpses throughout the book, you see him dealing with Levana in the aftermath of Cinder's escape and his own conflicting emotions towards New Beijing's best mechanic.... Basically the result is me in utter agony. Especially after the way this book ended! I swear, Marissa Meyer is trying to kill me with all this anxiety. Evil, evil author.....(just kidding).If I thought Cinder was amazing (and it totally was) then Scarlet basically took all the awesomesauce that went into writing Cinder and upped the ante, taking readers from the sweet innocence of the Cinderella retelling to a darker and grittier story. The alternating POVs in this story were handled incredibly well, and the way in which Cinder and Scarlet's arcs converged was flawless. Like a puzzle whose pieces are falling together, I'm starting to see how all these different fairytales are interconnected and it is kind of blowing my mind!All in all:For the love of all that is good and holy, I need that next book. I can't even bring myself to start another book because my head is still wrapped up in the world of the Lunar Chronicles, yearning to know what happens next.

(oh, the Wolf has something to do with my grandmother? Suspicious background? Unparalleled fighting skills? Great, I'll follow hin into the wilderness.)Or maybe it was the frustrating subplot. (CINDER - why won't you just send Kai an email or something? You're half robot, I'm sure you can figure out how to send a digital message.)Or it could have been the even more frustrating subplot. (KAI - You have LITERALLY trained for this your entire life. How are you so consistently bad at being Emperor?)Or maybe it was Wolf's - nah, he was just too great.Overall, this was an entertaining, light read. I like the subtle hints of the characters yet to come and I really look forward to the next one!Edit: As pointed out by Angela's Booked, I completely neglected to mention the absolute best part of the book: Thorne.I mean, how could you not love him?There's this: \nA relieved grin filled up Thorne\u2019s face. \u201cWe\u2019re having another moment, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cIf by a moment, you mean me not wanting to strangle you for the first time since we met, then I guess we are.\u201d \n And this: \n\"But I'm a wanted fugitive, like Cinder.\" Thorne continued. \"They do realise I'm missing, don't they?\"\"Maybe they're grateful,\" Cinder muttered.\n\n\nAND THIS:\n\n \n\"I don't like to think of it as 'stolen.' They have no proof that I didn't plan on giving it back\"\n I am eternally sorry for neglecting the banter in my original review."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "I re read this on audioI love Scarlet so much and of course, Wolf! This is my wolf, not just a wolf man that he really looks like =) I always wanted to be a werewolf when I grew up but it hasn't happened yet and I doubt it ever will! ***SOME SPOILERS***Scarlet has been looking for her grandma ma. Where is she? What is gong on? Well, I'm not going to tell you about that. Scarlet helps her grandma run their farm, Benoit farms. Scarlet cruises around in her hovercraft thing dropping off veggies to some places. On this one trip, Scarlet manages to meet Wolf and he ends up coming with her. Meanwhile, Cinder is in jail and she meets Thorne. Oh, Thorne is a character. Cinder and Thorne make their escape because Thorne has a spaceship. The joy! Cinder can get the hell out of dodge. Iko ends up becoming the ship, fun times. The ship is called Rampion in case you were wondering. Cinder and Thorne end up meeting up with Scarlet and Wolf down the line and they are all in it together now. I LOVE IT! In other places, Prince Kai is dealing with Queen \"jerk\" Levana. Fun times for Kai as well. NOT. Anyhoo, I loved the re=read on audio and off to the next. \u2665***Old stupid review from 2015***This book is so awesome!! I loved it more than Cinder and I loved that book a lot. Cinder was just the start of a whole new world. Scarlet continues on with Cinder and new people that you love and hate.

The books are worth reading just for this adorable, sarcastic, arrogant idiot. He is still one of my favorite characters of all time and he just gets better and better throughout the series. His friendship with Cinder is everything.This book was actually the weakest one in the series for me but I still loved it in the end! The characters and their stories haven't all come together or synced up yet, so the story is very split between Scarlet & Wolf on their mission and then Cinder & Thorne doing their own thing. But this book also feels like a necessary stepping stone in order to make the scope of the story so much broader in the sequels. The tone of Scarlet's story seems a bit darker than the first book because she has to go to Paris to rescue her grandmother who's been kidnapped by a gang. Wolf is a street fighter and Scarlet meets him at a French cafe she's delivering her farm's vegetables to, so everyone gets a solid backstory. I wasn't totally sure what to make of Wolf and his pack at first, but I liked him way more in the sequels.This whole story was super creative and I LOVED the way everyone's storylines came together at the end! It's clearly a fairy tale retelling (Scarlet even wears a red hoodie), but it builds such a creative world with complex characters and a strong story that it seems completely original... and it really is. I haven't found a group of characters this realistic, diverse, and lovable in many other books!"}, {"userName": "April (Aprilius Maximus)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20658145-april-aprilius-maximus", "userReview": "*4.5 STARS*First read - 15th February 2014Reread - 13th November 2015I don't know, for some reason this is my least favourite in the series?"}, {"userName": "Maria V.

In fact, I didn\u2019t really plan on continuing the series. Except bestie kept bugging me about it.So I started this, a little reluctantly. And then...THIS WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN CINDER. LIKE WHAT. Pros: By far my biggest problem with the first book was how predictable it was. Like we all could all pretty much guess what the deal with Princess Selene was, couldn\u2019t we? Most of that book was just establishing the dynamic of Cinderella and her step-sisters, and then she meets the prince... and oh wow they start to fall in love. Surprise. Surprise. We\u2019ve all seen it before and it was boring. NOT HEREThis perfectly blended the original fairytale with sci-fi elements in fun and creative ways. There were so many things I didn't see coming and I just honestly had no idea where the story was going. Scarlet\u2019s story blended very well with Cinder's to expand upon this really interesting world. I really enjoyed most of the characters here, including one\u2019s that seemed flat in the first book? Kai is still a little boring to me, but Cinder really started to come into her own. She was an all-around stronger character and her struggles were more interesting than the classic Cinderella struggles. But it was definitely the new characters that made this book for me. Mainly:Scarlet. My bae. -\tIs appropriately afraid of hot-guy when she needs to be. No Bella Swanning here-\tBut that fear doesn\u2019t mean she also won\u2019t fight like hell. Because she will.-\tHas a deep loyalty to family that didn\u2019t extend to justifying their mistakes.-\tPenchant for firearms.-\tThe whole world is going to hell and there\u2019s all this chaos and then: \u201cI can fly the ship.\u201d -\tA little ball of sunshine and rage-\tThat shotgun scene. Just yesThis is how you write \u201cstrong, sassy\u201d female protagonists, YA authors. She wasn\u2019t overpowered. She wasn\u2019t annoying. She wasn't absurdly special or good at things. She was just delightfully independent character with her own motivations and goals--and ability to move towards those goals. Thorne. How do I count the ways?-\tStarted a prison riot over soap-\tWinks during his mugshot -\tSeems to ship Cinder and Kai after watching one press conference-\tLeather jackets-\tBefriends a cyborg in a society prejudiced against them-\tTells Iko she\u2019s \u201cthe prettiest\u201d He gave me Han Solo and Jack Harkness vibes (two other cocky space-captains I love) and really invigorated a ton of desperately needed humor into this story. His friendship with Cinder was glorious and showed how funny she could be as well. The writing here was really sharp and fit the story very well. It did a great job establishing the characters and the setting without relying on purple prose. Especially since this changed from the Beijing setting to France and the differences were illustrated very well.I didn\u2019t quite love Wolf as much as everyone else seemed to, but I\u2019m very curious to see more about him. He has a ton of potential and a very interesting backstory. I just want to see how he proves himself further on. Cons I really enjoyed Scarlet and Wolf\u2026 but couldn\u2019t help but think they moved a little fast? I really enjoyed their whole dynamic, but they\u2019ve known each other like what, two-days?There were a handful of times I really wished Marissa Meyer would have shown rather than told. Particularly statements like \u2018It looked like the words pained him, but he had to continue on.\u2019 Or \u2018She seemed happy.\u2019 Or \u2018He looked at her with a protective stare.\u2019 (All of these are paraphrased, but you get the idea.) This matched the writing style, I just wish we\u2019d been shown what some of these expressions looked like so we could infer their meaning, rather than simply being told.Not a reflection of the book itself as much as me expressing displeasure. This is my physical copy of the book. I was pretty certain that wasn\u2019t the actual line, and Google was quick to affirm this. So\u2026 why is this what mine says? Is this something I can contact the site I purchased the book through? Or is it just an unfortunate misprint I have to deal with?  In Conclusion Can\u2019t talk right now, I\u2019m looking for my copy of Cress. I need to see where this story goes."}, {"userName": "prag \u2728", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29249069-prag", "userReview": "I'm!! A!! Mess!!

I'm not sure how else to put it- but it's come a long way and been a pleasant surprise. I love where it's going! In general- it's not a super emotional series so far, but I'm definitely invested in Cinder's journey throughout the books. Obviously this book brings in a new main character based off of Red Riding Hood. I liked Scarlet and her story- and Wolf was alright. I don't think I was as connected to her story as I was Cinder's - but it was still fun to try and figure out everything that was going to happen in comparison to the original fairy tale. Ok but obviously the thing I want to talk about the most is Thorne.  (Hence my endless status updates about him...)I'm pretty sure this is his face EVERY time he meets a female...All my friends LOVE him and I totally see why. Dude is freaking hilarious. He's the most shameless flirt I think I've ever read about, save Nikolai Lansov (Grisha Trilogy). Not to mention he's a complete diva. With dimples just FYI. So basically he's endless entertainment. I'm excited to see what happens when he inevitably meets Cress! Anyway this series has come a long way from what I expected. Some of the plot (the part that exists around the fairy tale retelling) can be a bit predictable, but it still has some pretty decent twists- and the characters are entertaining.

Seriously, I'm over here loving Scarlet and her \"alpha\" personality and everything that she stands for. How do people think she is annoying? This was me this whole book:Like literally constantly sucking in a breath and holding it, then after I have processed what happened, I do it again. So again, why you be mad about this installment? Was it because it wasn't only Cinder and Kai's point of views anymore? Scarlet wasn't just thrown in there for kicks and giggles, her story proved very important to the story as a whole. Was it because Scarlet was so dominate in her personality? Because, and I apologize in advanced for my feminism side popping out, but I loved that side of her. It wasn't the guy always making the move or constantly wanting more than just a snuggle. This girl took charge of her heart and went after what she wanted and didn't care if she was \"suppose\" to wait till he made the first move.Scarlet's grandm\u00e9re is missing. And I don't mean like she packed a bag and left town. She literally was in the middle of doing something and and left without a trace. Her chip was even left back at her house so no one could track her. It's been like three weeks, and everyone just assumes it's the town's crazy person doing something crazy.She wasn't doing something crazy. I'm not going to go into details, because spoilers; but seriously, her grandmother has a lot of explaining to do.Side note: she could have made this a beauty and the beast retelling too if she substituted grandm\u00e9re for dad. Cinder is on the run with no other than every girl's favorite smooth talker: Cadet Captain Carswell Thorne. He is hilarious. Cinder couldn't be annoyed more, but I couldn't be anymore entertained. Cinder is on the hunt for more information about herself, how she got to be the way she is and what she is going to do about it.This is Thorne and all his glory. She is finally realizing that maybe the choices she thought were for the best, actually made things a lot worse. Kai may need her more than she knows. Will she risk it, or continue running?Kai is so confused. Between his heart and his mind, he can't decided what to do exactly about Cinder. The Lunar Queen Levana is beyond steaming and is ready to declare war on Earth because she doesn't have Cinder in her clutches. What is he to do? How can he calm her?WOLF, my dear.He doesn't understand many things because he isn't from around there. But he has a kind side that he doesn't let a lot see, either because he doesn't want to or because he can't. You never know what side he is actually on though. I'm still kind of wondering just because he gave me a lot of whiplash. Basically, I loved this installment. There was war. There were animalistic people. There were secrets revealed. There were so many twist. There were so many surprises. And there was a horrible ending that makes me wish I could read the next book like right now. It wasn't really a cliff hanger, but it wasn't comforting.Now I'm ready for my third girl.
