This is a violent realm, stewed in the corruption of a decadent church.\u2019\u2018I know.\u2019\u2018The papists will use every means to present us from building the christian commonwealth, and so God\u2019s blood I will use every means to overcome them.\u2019\u2018I am sorry if my judgement erred.\u2019\u2018Some say you are soft, Matthew, \u2018 he said quietly. \u2018Lacking in fire and godly zeal, even perhaps in loyalty.\u2019Lord Cromwell had the trick of staring fixedly at you, unblinking, until you felt compelled to drop your gaze. You would look up again to find those hard brown eyes still boring into you. I felt my heart pound. I had tried to keep my doubts, my weariness, to myself; surely I had told nobody.\u201d\nA view eastwards along the chancel of the church at the Cistercian monastery of Rievaulx Abbey in the Yorkshire Wolds. The monastery was founded in the 12th century and abandoned during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.I had just been introduced to Matthew Shardlake when he is summoned to the office of Lord Thomas Cromwell. Shardlake has become disillusioned about working for Cromwell. It is arduous work, requiring travel hither and yon, and mentally draining to see the look of fear and barely suppressed loathing that people feel for a representative of Cromwell. To make matters worse the infirmity he was born with, a hunchback, continues to give him more and more trouble with each passing day. Already weary in soul and feeling the physical toil of the past few years the last thing Shardlake wants to do is to be dispatched to the St. Donatus monastery at Scarnsea. But there has been a murder and not just any murder, but the murder of a Cromwell representative while he was investigating the monastery for improprieties. The killer was sending a very clear message to Cromwell by beheading his agent. Cromwell\u2019s own head is lucky to still be setting squarely on his shoulders after he became such an ardent ally of the recently beheaded Anne Boleyn. To prove his loyalty to Henry the 8th Cromwell is fervently enforcing the recent First Act of Succession (1536) dissolving as many monasteries as possible, within the confines of the new law. He is confiscating their lands and gold baubles to help bolster the King\u2019s treasury. St. Donatus is one of the larger monasteries all of whom hope to survive the purge. Although anybody in the know realizes that Henry will not be happy with just a few when he can pass a law, Second Act of Succession (1539), that will bring them all down. Right now it is 1537 and Shardlake can offer some assurances to the abbot that the monastery can still be saved. \nHaughmond Abbey. The extensive remains of an Augustinian abbey, including its abbots' quarters, refectory and cloister.This was a time of uneasy alliances with Catholics swearing allegiance to the new church not because they necessary believed, but because they wished to keep their property and to keep their heads attached to the rest of their bodies. People used the new laws to settle old grievances, turning their enemies in for Catholic devotion that reminds me of neighbors turning on neighbors in Germany under the Third Reich. Protestants killing Catholics. Catholics killing Protestants. Good lord, all so a king can bed a particularly crafty young lady who would settle for nothing less than the crown on her head before she ministered to the Kingly \u201ccrown\u201d. Anne Boleyn was a true Eve, nearly bringing a kingdom down with her feminine wiles and her \u201cprogressive\u201d religious ideas. Think of the lives that would have been saved if Henry the 8th in one of his many mishaps had crushed his balls or better yet sliced his dinger off. Are we to believe that his main objective in having so many wives was to procreate an heir? Maybe so, but truly in the course of doing so it is hard not to see him as bordering on sexual conquesting lunacy. I know he was worried about starting a war with Spain and France, but wouldn\u2019t this all have been easier and saved a lot of hanging, beheading, burnings etc. if only Catherine of Aragon had say had an accident in the bath or had a bit of loose stone masonry fall on her head? Not that I wish ill on Catherine. She seems to be the one purity in this whole sordid mess, but would thousands of lives been spared? Shardlake with his rather comely (male) assistant in tow arrives at the monastery to discover that there are more problems than just one murdered man. Needless to say everyone is on edge knowing that the King\u2019s representative needs very little cause to close the monastery and confiscate their lands. Shardlake finds a nest of barely repentant monks still clinging to their idols and traditions. It is too much to expect that people can just flip a switch and do away with beliefs that have sustained them their whole lives. \nThe ruins of Glastonbury Abbey dissolved in 1539, following the execution of the Abbot on charges of treason.A monk is poisoned...what did he know or what did he see? An old murder comes to light of a young girl who once worked at the monastery. Before long Shardlake wonders if he is chasing one murderer or three? He soon discovers that the monastery keeps two sets of books and the missing blue book may be the very thing he needs to find to unmask at least one of the killers. To make things even more irritating for him he finds himself competing with his young assistant for the affections of a young lass who works in the infirmary of the monastery.Shardlake is very dismissive of Catholicism, a true believer in the Reformation, but at the same time he is sickened by the lives that are being ruined needlessly. He certainly feels the pressure to not only uncover the true murderers, but also to reach solutions that will put him back in the good graces of Cromwell. It is a time when people must deny their true nature whether they are homosexual, Anabaptist, or harboring affection for the Pope of Rome. It is always tragic when people who have much more in common than they have in disagreement are killing each other over the whims of Kings. I will definitely be reading more in this series.

The genre feels overdone and, well, a little bit boring. To me it all looks like the same regurgitated story. I blame the terrible police dramas on television; they make me yawn when I see how stupid they are. I did a two year course in forensic science, and it never ceases to amaze me how the writers of these television shows think that wearing gloves will therefore mean that the crime scene is not contaminated by the otherwise exposed investigators. Never mind the fact that they are trampling over evidence, leaving their own hairs and jumping to ridiculous conclusions based upon preliminary testing. These things are horribly inaccurate to the professional field; they are always forensically inaccurate. So, regardless of how this is handled in modern crime books, I always avoid them to avoid similar annoyance. This, however, isn\u2019t a modern crime book. This is a murder mystery set in the political upheaval of Tudor England. The churches are undergoing dissolution, hence the title of the book. This, to me, sounded utterly fantastic. I mean, at last, a crime book that I want to read. I have a real interest in the Tudor period of history. It was a reign that changed the face of England. I mean, imagine how different the country would be today if King Henry VIII never broke with Rome, and with the Pope. Arguments between branches of Christianity may never have become so heated. King Charles I may never have been executed for his Catholic sympathies, amongst other things. The Dissolution with the Catholic Church changed the face of England forever along with its sequential history.  Murder in the monastery  This book combines a classic whodunit scenario with the intrigue of the sixteenth century; it is brilliantly handled. At the heart of this book is a very human character: Matthew Shardlake. Shardlake is a commissioner sent, by Thomas Cromwell, to investigate his predecessor\u2019s murder at a monastery. Shardlake has a twisted back so is consequently spurned by the religious zealots of the time. This immediately drew upon my sympathy. He is obviously no different to his peers, but for all their supposed enlightenment, toward the religious reforms, they still shallowly judge someone for their appearance. It\u2019s a cruel world. This along with Shardlake\u2019s unsuccessfulness with the ladies, results in a very damaged yet resolute commissioner. \"This is not Thomas More\u2019s Utopia, a nation of innocent savages waiting only for God\u2019s word to complete their happiness. This is a violent realm, stewed in the corruption of a decadent church.\"Thus, his investigation is no easy affair. He is met with disgust, scorn and damn right revulsion at every turn. But, he overcomes it. He is used to it, and has risen far above it. He gets on with his job and sets out to find what caused the death of a supposedly innocent man. Shardlake is clever, compassionate and determined. He has the nose of a bloodhound. He analyses the facts in a pragmatic way; he doesn\u2019t jump to conclusion and only delivers a realistic approach to the crime. He questions everything, which left me in a continuous state of suspense until he found his answers. The historical setting of the churches, the towns and the people are brought to life. The turmoil the age is captured along with the skulduggery of its inhabitants. Thomas Cromwell is portrayed as a mean old brute which is quite interesting after reading Hilary Mantel\u2019s version of him in which he is sympathised with, greatly. The scenario in this book kept me questioning everything. At one point there were at least seven suspects. Each had a strong motive. As the focus of the suspicion changed, so did the plausibility of each motive. I am proud to say, that my initial guess was half right. I\u2019ll say no more on that regard, other than this had a really intense ending. It's a great read. Shardlake series1. Dissolution- A suspense filled four stars. 2.

The novel is the first installment in Matthew Shardlake series. The action is set in the time of (in)famous king Henry VIII and it has as main character a hunchback lawyer under the service of the equally famous and controversial figure, Thomas Cromwell. The titles hints on the subject of the novel, at least it does to readers familiar with British history. I knew vaguely of the Catholic Church Dissolution and reading this has been a perfect opportunity to improve my knowledge. Samson, with a PHD in history, presents the historical events without transforming the book in a history lesson, which I appreciated. About the mystery part\u2026 one of Cromwell\u2019s Commissioners, that is, the person sent to negotiate the surrender of Scarnsea monastery is found brutally murdered on its premises and Mr. Shardlake is sent to investigate together with his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The lawyer arrives in a hostile environment where each monk seems to hold a secret and could be the potential murderer. Under overwhelming time and secrecy pressure imposed by Cromwell, Shardlake begins a long set of interviews and immerses himself in the life of the monastery. I learned interesting details about the monastic life, most of them not showing the Catholic Church in the best of lights. I felt that the portrayal of the Catholic Church and of the reformist was balanced and that the conclusion rings true event Todays: Whenever people with power fight the only true losers are the common people. \u201cIt seems a universal rule in this world that people will always look for victims and scapegoats, does it not? Especially at times of difficulty and tension.\u201d I had 2 small problems with this novel. Firstly, some of the characters were not drawn enough, felt flat and one dimensional. Secondly, the way the killer was discovered felt a bit more like a stroke of luck more than the result of a careful investigation. All in all, a highly enjoyable read which will make me continue with the series, no doubt about it."}, {"userName": "PattyMacDotComma", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma", "userReview": "5\u2605\u201cHe [Thomas Cromwell] was holding up a casket [small box] and studying the contents with a contemptuous frown, his wide, narrow-lipped mouth down-turned above his lantern chin. His jaw held thus made me think of a great trap that at any moment might open and swallow one whole with a casual gulp.\u201dAnd with a brutal gulp, Cromwell dissolved and swallowed the monasteries across England, beginning with smaller ones in 1536 and completing the dissolution of even the largest old ones by 1540, pensioning off a few monks but turning everyone else loose into the poor neighbouring townships. The monasteries were infamous for hoarding wealth, and Cromwell was determined to collect it to augment the royal coffers via the Court of Augmentations. There, they assess and divvy up the proceeds to buy up more land for the Crown (and cronies, no pun intended, and no - it\u2019s from the Greek). So nobody is looking after the poor.Briefly, the Pope wasn\u2019t happy about Henry VIII\u2019s annul/remarry plans, so Henry started his own church, the Church of England with himself as the head. Today\u2019s C of E is also known as the Anglican Church, and Queen Elizabeth II is the Supreme Governor. (There is some historic religious connection to past centuries, and influence from the Protestant Reformation, but I\u2019d rather get back to the mystery!)Matthew Shardlake tells the story. He is a lawyer in his late 30s who is hampered by his deformed hunched back. But he\u2019s intelligent and quick-witted, and Cromwell has been happy with Shardlake\u2019s work. In the opening scene, quoted above, Cromwell commissions Shardlake to investigate the Monastery of Scarnsea after showing him a letter he has just received:\u201cMy master Singleton is foully murdered in the heart of the monastery, in a most terrible manner. He was found this morning in the kitchen, in a lake of blood, his head cut clean off. Some great enemy of Your Lordship must have done this, but all here deny it. The church has been desecrated and the Great Relic of the Penitent Thief with its bloody nails is vanished away.. . . Please send help my lord and tell me what I should do.\u201dSo Shardlake and his talented, loyal off-sider Mark, a handsome young ladies\u2019 man, set off in the wet, blustery cold of an English winter to replace the murdered commissioner. Cromwell was arguably the most feared man in England then, and his commissioners struck terror into the hearts of even the most powerful abbots. Hunchbacks were considered unlucky then, so people tend to give Shardlake a wide berth, which makes it easy to find privacy in the pubs and inns along their way.The wintry weather, the wind, the bitter cold sent me to the firesides with them. The monastery is just as miserable, but the situation is hot with plenty of suspects. In the winter, Scarnsea is a hard place to break into, but the monks and monastery staff would like to think the murderer came from outside. Needless to say, Shardlake does have to flash his credentials a few times when insisting he can demand access to everything. Every single thing. Every desk drawer, every cupboard, every cell. He\u2019s as nervous about failing Cromwell as he is about being murdered. (Oh, yes, there are a couple more deaths! Did I forget to mention that?)It\u2019s a wonderful who-dunnit with a colourful cast of very different characters, well identified in welcome, subtle ways by Sansom as they appear and reappear in the story. It\u2019s so easy to get lost, especially in historical fiction, that it\u2019s refreshing to find an author who\u2019s not afraid to admit a reader might not have committed every name and scene to memory. The list of Obedentiaries (Monastery officials) in the front is there if you need it, too.The cast includes civilians in the kitchen and on the grounds, and our intrepid fellows both fall for the same bright, pretty girl in the kitchen, which causes some anguish and awkwardness, but she is kind to our hunchbacked hero in spite of obviously favouring handsome, younger Mark. The townsfolk are desperately poor and starving (and cold!) while the brothers eat well. These are real people, not just theatre props, and I loved it all.There\u2019s a lot about religion, with monks and everyone trying hard to remember not to use Catholic phrases in this new world. One slip, and you could end up being stretched on the rack, tearing joints apart. One seemingly mad monk has survived this, only just. But they do bend the rules. When questioning the time of a murder, Shardlake asks:\u201c\u2018This was at five o\u2019clock?\u2019\u2018\u2018The clock had struck a little before.\u2019\u2018Had Matins begun?\u2019 \u2018No, Matins is sung late here. Usually towards six.\u2019 \u2018St Benedict\u2019s rule prescribes midnight.\u2019He smiled gently. \u2018St Benedict wrote his rule for Italians, sir, not people who have to live through English winters. The office is sung and God hears it.My kind of thinking!There are interesting sidelights, such as when they tour the premises.\u201c\u2018Beer,\u2019 I noted. \u2018Empty barrels?\u2019 Mark asked. \u2018No, full ones. The monastery brewhouse has a monopoly in supplying the town\u2019s beer. They can set the price. It\u2019s in the founding charter.\u2019\u201d Talk about a licence to print money! No wonder Cromwell wants a piece of the action!The language is appropriate to the era without being overly archaic or arcane. I did question the phrase \u201cruncible peas\u201d, (as in Edward Lear's The Owl and the Pussycat poem which mentioned a \u201cruncible spoon\u201d many years later. (I also discovered that a runcible spoon sounds similar to my favourite piece of multi-purpose cutlery, the splade or spork, depending on your preference. But I digress.)The story seems accurate and informative as well as entertaining, I enjoyed the investigative process, and I didn\u2019t guess the perpetrator. In those times and in those dreadful conditions, even I would have been tempted to murder. Now, though, I\u2019m really looking forward to the next in the series!"}, {"userName": "James Thane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483907-james-thane", "userReview": "Even though I read a lot of history, I've never been a fan of historical fiction and so when one of the book clubs to which I belong picked this novel as a monthly read, I approached it with some trepidation. For the most part, though, I was pleasantly surprised and I enjoyed the book more than I expected to.Dissolution is set in England and the action takes place over a couple of extremely cold and snowy weeks in 1537. This is shortly after King Henry VIII has broken with the Catholic church and created the Church of England, with himself as the head of the church. At this point, of course, religious freedom is only a dim, distant dream, and all English people are required by law to follow Henry into the new Anglican church, whether they like it or not.Many of them don't like it. They remain true to the Catholic church and continue to give their religious allegiance to the Pope. Many of these people will be persecuted for their beliefs and not a few will be executed. In many respects, these are not the sunniest of times.Once establishing himself as head of the English church, Henry conveniently grants himself a divorce from his wife, Catherine of Aragon, so that he can marry Ann Boleyn. The Pope had refused to grant Henry an annulment of his marriage to Catherine and this precipitated the break between Henry and the Pope.Henry also moves expeditiously to confiscate property in England that had belonged to the Catholic church. Most important, there were many Catholic monasteries in England that controlled vast amounts of valuable land. Henry began the process of dissolving the monasteries (the Dissolution) and appropriating their wealth. His principal ally in this effort was his vicar general, Thomas Cromwell, who was much feared by Henry's opponents.Cromwell sends a commissioner to begin the process of dissolving the monastery of Scarnsea on the southern coast of England, but shortly after arriving at Scarnsea the commissioner is murdered. Cromwell now sends one of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, a lawyer named Matthew Shardlake to investigate the murder and to conclude the dissolution of the monastery.Shardlake is a brilliant lawyer and is devoted to the reform of the church. He is also a hunchback who has always been self-conscious and socially ostracized to some extent because of his handicap. Shardlake is accompanied by a handsome young assistant named Mark Poer, and the two make their way through the snow to Scarnsea to find a tangled web of murder and intrigue along with financial and sexual irregularities. More murders will follow their arrival and it's clear that Shardlake and his young assistant are also in grave danger every moment that they remain in the monastery. The burning question is whether or not Matthew Shardlake can accomplish his mission before both he and Mark become victims themselves of the evil that seems to infuse Scarnsea.What I enjoyed most about this book was the atmosphere that Sansom creates. He vividly recreates the turmoil of the period along with the sights, sounds and smells of the era. The reader feels the chill in his or her own bones as the characters struggle to stay warm in the middle of the freezing cold weather. This historical detail is engrossing and the story is a compelling one.If I have a complaint about the book, it's that about halfway through the book, the story started to drag a bit. Shardlake spends an awful lot of time wandering through the snow from one part of the monastery to another in order to interview people and it starts to get a bit repetitious. I found myself encouraging Shadlake to pick up the pace a bit. This is a book that runs 385 pages which, in my estimation, would have been much better at about 325 pages. But that is a relatively small complaint, and this is a book that should appeal to anyone who enjoys historical mysteries. 3.5 stars for me, rounded up to four."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "5.0 stars. This story grabbed me from the very first page and kept me engaged throughout the entire book. I do not read as much historical/crime fiction as I do science fiction/fantasy but this book might cause that to change given how much I enjoyed this. I am a bit if a history buff and I was drawn to this story because it is set during the English Reformation, a period I was interested to learn more about. The main character, Matthew Shardlake, is a hunchback, English lawyer working for Thomas Cromwell (the architect of the English Reformation). Shardlake is sent to a Benedictine monastery to investigate the brutal murder of one of Cromwell's men. However, Shardlake's true mission is to arrange for the voluntary surrender of the monastery to the English crown.The book was very well written, with a complex, well structured plot and very memorable characters.

Matthew, who was working for Thomas Cromwell, wanted to impress his boss and was adamant to solve the case as soon as possible but alas mystery turned murkier and another murder was committed. Since it was 1500, so no modern sciences to help us in way of finger prints, autopsy, lie detector test etc. Matthew had to talk to monks and see all of them as suspects, and that\u2019s what I like about historical mysteries. I have not read many but the few I have read, I liked how the detectives has to depend on their instincts and hunches and someone was always on their heels to murder them.I loved the writing style of Samson and how he depicted the strife in the English population.

Really exciting, really atmospheric and the novel for which the phrase 'page turner' was created. Its the first in a series, in which i shall most definitely be heavily indulging, revolving around a well drawn character called Matthew Shardlake who, when the novel begins, is an ardent if gentle reformer working for Thomas Cromwell just as, with the death of Jane Seymour, Henry VIII is set free to vomit his horrible nastiness over a few more women.Shardlake, a lawyer who struggles with the disadvantage of suffering from a hunchback, is sent to a Monastery on the East Coast at Scarnsea to investigate the brutal murder of one of Cromwell's men who had been sent there so as to speed up the process of dissolution. In the latter part of the 1530's Cromwell had taken on the role of destroying the monastic tradition of England couching it in terms of cleansing the realm of the filth of papist domination. This Shardlake applauds and spends the first part of his stay at St Donatus monastery sneering and judging and belittling. The monastic community is painted as a community almost without saving grace. Overly worldy and lazy, riven by division and hate and all of the monks bar the black moorish convert Brother Guy are represented as gross hypocrites.Initially this ridiculous sweeping generalization, dismissing every monk as a fatuous idiot or hypocrite, annoyed and jarred as i read but of course the whole point is that the novel is in the first person. We walk in Matthew's world, caught up in his bigotry and judgements, we see the protestant reform and its leaders through his idealized and naive eyes and the catholicism is tarnished by his experiences, including his cruel rejection, because of his deformity, when he sought priesthood as a lad.Gradually, though he does not come to think particularly highly of catholicism, he does begin to realize that perhaps it is not the monstrous fetid swamp he believed and nor is the longed for Protestant Commonwealth just around the corner. He sees more clearly and thus more sadly.The story itself is wonderfully exciting with marvelous hiss/boo villains, a handsome manservant and long-suffering servant girl who provide the opening for ramblings on love and loss as the snobbery of social division in which even Shardlake partakes threatens there future, a mad tortured monk who might not be as mad as Shardlake first thinks and all sorts of links to the court of Henry and his shadowy henchmen as well as suspects galore for the brutal beheading.The story is cleverly written in that Sansom does not make Shardlake anything other than a man of his time. He is not made to think and speak in a way that no man of his time would( Please note writers of the british farcical courtroom drama 'Garrow's Law' which makes our hero some 21st Century reformer thinking and speaking and behaving in a way that is about 200 years ahead of his time.) This is not what Sansom has done in the character of Matthew. He is zealous for the reform, though not a vicious zealot, but his hatreds and prejudices are similar to those of his peers if not expressed with such brutal cruelty as was perhaps the norm. His disability perhaps makes him less likely to condemn the outsider but he is not made to look at the 1530's as an enlightened man of the 2000's. Homosexuality is seen as nothing but foul and perverse and beyond the pale, catholics and anabaptists are to be scorned and loathed and, at the beginning of the book at least, your betters, those above you in society, are to be trusted and believed. God has given you a position and you should not be anything but content with that.I found the world he painted pulsed with life, the brutality and degradation, the despair and fear, the struggles and unrest all whirled round in a great turmoil of a society being changed irrevocably. The reign of Henry resulted in far more changes than just a wife or two and this rumbling underground, gradually heading towards the surface is well captured by the prose and plot of 'Dissolution'.Clever"}, {"userName": "Maria Chnoic", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46346297-maria-chnoic", "userReview": "This is a good old-fashioned who-dun-it, with bodies dropping every few chapters.

The book is set in 1537 England. Henry VIII has left the Catholic church and the country is divided between those faithful to the new Church of England, with Henry VIII as its head, and the Catholic church. A royal commissioner is murdered in the monastery of Scarnsea on the southeast coast of England. Thomas Cromwell, Henry's vicar general, calls a lawyer, Matthew Shardlake, to his office and tells him to go to the monastery, find the murderer and persuade the monastery to surrender its property to the king. Shardlake and his assistant Mark Poer go the monastery and investigate. More murders happen and the ending was a surprise to me. I thought that the author wrote a very evocative novel, painting a vivid picture of Tudor England, with all its cruelties and maneuverings by various players jockeying for power and money.Two quotes-- Catholic Church holy relics: \"They say that there are two headed dragons in the Indies. Well here we have two headed saints\" {Cromwell showing Shardlake two different skulls of the same saint}Shardlake, dealing with an informer: \"I was shaking like an aspen leaf from head to foot.\" I give this library book a solid 4 out 5 stars.

Set in the 1500s of Henry VIII, it clearly bears parallels with Wolf Hall which is set two wives earlier. It has to be said that it lacks the beauty of the language of that novel or its subtle, multilayered realistic characterisation. Mantell's Cromwell is a far more engaging and convincing narrator than Sansom's Shardlake.Similarly, set in an isolated monastery, narrated by an articulate first person narrator who is investigating a murder, comparisons with Name of the Rose are easy to make. I may be mistaken, but I wonder whether the reference to the (fake) lost Comedy of Aristotle in Scarnsea's library was a deliberate echo (or Eco?) of Name of the Rose.Again, however, Dissolution comes off worse in the comparison: it lacks the intensely almost arcanely intellectualism of Eco, who I love hugely; the language comes across as being broadly modern with the occasional nod towards the period whereas Eco's writing has always struck me an amazingly authentic.This said, look at the writers with whom Sansom is being compared: I cannot think of any writer who would come off better in such a contest! It is the fact of the parallels that almost demand the comparisons to be made which is the problem, not the writing or the plotting itself. Sansom has so far succeeded in engaging and entertaining me, creating a universe which feels reasonably authentic. That seems to me to be worth a good 4 stars..."}, {"userName": "Marita", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17415449-marita", "userReview": "This is a good historical mystery, told by a master story teller.

He is developed throughout the story, creating a multi-faceted, compelling protagonist. Passers by only see Shardlake as a cripple, but the reader sees his pride, insecurities, longing for companionship, and devotion to a cause that he believes is sincere.Through the example of the Monastery of St. Donatus at Scarnsea, we are shown first hand what it was like for the monks at this time to be at the mercy of the king. First they were ordered to change centuries old rituals to fit the reformist trend, only to eventually lose their entire way of life. Putting it on this personal level and seeing what happens to each of the characters Sansom creates, the reader can vividly imagine this period of history.The author's depiction of Tudor times is second to none. Daily living and all its struggles are injected into this story without becoming info-dumps or narrations of boring detail. Cromwell makes a couple of brief appearances, and he is realistically written, if not as sympathetically as in Mantel's novels.I appreciated the author's ability to give each of his characters an active faith that did not truly fit into any category that the government of the time was attempting to create. Shardlake proclaims himself an ardent reformer, until he is struck with the realization that the reforms are more about redistribution of wealth than true worship. Though the setting was a religious house and each person revealed their thoughts on God, the book never overdoes the Christian theme or becomes preachy.And then there are the murders! I loved this book for the great character development and visualization of Tudor England, but it is also a great mystery. Shardlake is sent to Scarnsea to investigate the murder of his fellow commissioner and discovers a much more tangled web than he expected. A must read for anyone interested in this period of history."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma", "userReview": "'The Bible says God made man in his image but I think we make and remake him, in whatever image happens to suit our shifting needs.'This is a complex time in Tudor history, brilliantly brought to life by CJ Sansom.

He is a good man and well developed intelligent character. He knows he is not a 'catch' for any woman because of his disability and yet it is painful to read of his hopes of genuine feelings between himself and a serving girl, and also to see his disillusionment with Reformers' dishonesty and corruption.I loved this book more when I was more of a historical fictionista but since I have been seduced by historical fantasy, I am slightly less keen. Still a really enjoyable and quality book and I will probably over time reread the others in the series.

I was so much engrossed in the world of 16th century England. The thing was lively and really set the tone. But, the thing went downhill afterwards. When I picked up this book, I had hoped for a clever and a complex mystery. It did seem like one in the initial pages. The main character, Matthew Shardlake alongside with his assistant Mark Poer goes to a monastery at Scarnsea to investigate the murder of a commissioner. The monastery is a strange place and gives negative and evil vibes and it really makes me feel like that some complex character with complex ideologies might be the culprit behind this. As the days goes by, we see back to back murders and Shardlake discovers a mess which he really did not expect. His character impressed me somehow. I found him as a very capable lawyer and also a very capable sleuth. However, at some point he is just not shown well. At one point I felt like he would not solve this without luck. I expected much more from other characters. I expected very much from Mark but it felt like he was just so much naive about so many things. Associating him with a Alice, a servant at the monastery was not such a good idea and it was the reason why this book did not impress me. Both characters of Mark and Alice were turned out to be totally senseless. The other characters like Jerome, Abbot Fabian, Brother Guy, Brother Gabriel were average. The intent behind murders were nothing but pure revenge and greed and that disappointed me a bit since I was expecting a very complex motive. I also think that this book just dragged on more than necessary. At times, we see Shardlake wasting time behind running from one end of monastery to another and questioning everyone which became very repetitive and boring. Despite all this shortcomings, I really liked the setup and historical link to this novel were accurate. i would recommend this to anyone who is into reading historical fiction. A casual reader of historical fiction will feel bored by some of the details in this book."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "This is a great murder mystery set in the 16th century, during the religious reformation of Thomas Cromwell and Henry VIII. The setting is a monastery in Scarnsea, and Matthew Shardlake is a hunchbacked lawyer who serves as a commissioner of Cromwell to investigate the murder, and to hasten the dissolving of St. Donatus, as a precedent and warning to other religious orders as to what awaits them. One murder turns into 4, with twists and turns and red herrings all along the way. This book has it all: excellent writing, great plot, flawed, believable characters, and it even throws in discussion of organized religion and who it actually serves, as well. Add to that a well researched time period that I became interested in with Hilary Mantel's \"Wolf Hall\" and \"Bring up the Bodies\", and I'm hooked.

Shardlake is sent by Cromwell to the Monastery of St Donatus the Ascendant at Scarnsea, Sussex. It is 1537 and the dissolution of the monasteries is underway. Cromwell had sent Commissioner Robin Singleton there with lawyer, Lawrence Goodhaps. Now Singleton has been found murdered and Shardlake is sent to investigate. He is accompanied by Mark Poer, a young man he had taken into his household as a family obligation. Mark has been in disgrace for his dalliance with a knight\u2019s daughter and Shardlake hopes that success in their mission will plead Poer\u2019s case for rehabilitation, while putting him in Cromwell\u2019s favour. However, once they arrive they find Goodhaps terrified and the monks suspicious and concerned about their future. Snow begins to fall, making travel difficult, and the monastery is isolated, with dangerous marshland outside the gates and the possibility of smugglers. Before long, Shardlake is embroiled in an investigation of murder, which reaches back to the trial and beheading of Ann Boleyn \u2013 an event which Shardlake attended on Cromwell\u2019s orders. Although this is the first novel in the series, and there are bumps along the way, the character of Shardlake himself already seems like an old friend. The setting \u2013 the isolated monastery with a fixed group of suspects\u2013 works very well. Mark Poer is not the greatest foil to Shardlake, but the novel introduces other characters who appear in later books. Overall, even re-reading this, it is an assured and excellent debut to a series which has to be my favourite historical mystery series in print. The next books in the series are: Dark Fire, Sovereign, Revelation, Heartstone, with Lamentation due out in 2014.

We only see castles, monasteries and so on as museum pieces now, but he describes how some of the buildings were in good condition, but others were decaying, even if still lived in. The author also brings to life the uncertainty of that time. The monks weren't sure if their monastery would survive, and the king was hoping for voluntary surrender where possible. Their servants weren't sure what would happen to them if the monastery closed. They werent' popular with the local villagers, and could expect no charity from them, and the monks would not even be in a position to look after themselves, let alone their servants. Their daily life was richly described, including the excesses of food and (relative) luxury in which they lived, compared to the local villagers. They had deviated from the original Benedictine way of life, but they explained, to their own satisfaction at least, why that had happened. Shardlake starts out believing totally in Cromwell and his reformist plans, but some doubt creeps in as the story unfolds. His relationship with his assistant is realistically told, with the strain of their task taking it toll on their friendship.I worked out 'whodunnit' before it was revealed.
