I love that is was about a rock band, because I absolutely love those bad boys but this one had a little twist. The main character was a rocker but not your typical tattooed, lie record bad boy but a tattooed, pierced bad girl. Rain aka Maddie. I loved her character. She was feisty and outspoken two wonderful traits in my book. But she had some demons that haunted her and she was about to face many hardships just to discover herself.Rain was different than Maddie although the were one in the same, Maddie was the cheerleader who wanted to,please others but was hiding her true self and decided she wanted to be true to herself so after high school she became Rain, the hard core rocker.\nAnd\nHer band mates for 5 years were not only friends but her family. I loved them all but Colton....\nHe was oh so yummy!!!! But that wasn't the first impression that drew me to him. Nope it was his loyalty and tenderness to Rain. He definitely was her rock. Now don't get me wrong he was oh so delicious especially those eyes. The tattoos were a added bonus, rocker uh well more points. I just wanted to.....\nAnd .....\nYet another fictional character I am swooning over. I may need some sort of therapy with all of these book boyfriends.Oh and let's not forget the piercing....\n\nThat man is just mmmmmm!!!!!!There was enough angst to get your blood a pumping too.Tanya well, I just wanted to....\nOr maybe bust out her kneecaps, to ya Harding style.Lol\nIn the beginning I didn't care for her family, I thought they were pretty mean but as the story progressed I loved them.I had a roller coaster of emotions during the story. I laughed, cried, yelled, got angry and sighed.I think the author rocked it!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Debra Presley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12224389-debra-presley", "userReview": "rating 5-Colton you did WHAT?--starsFollow Me:www.thebookenthusiast.netwww.facebook.com/thebookenthusiast\nBlessed Tragedy is heart-warming, heart-wrenching, heart-breaking, emotional, sexy and addicting. I read a very early copy of this book and I just couldn't get enough! The relationship between Rain and Colton had me swooning all over the place.I was immediately pulled into the story of Rain and her relationships with Colton, her band and her family. Blessed Tragedy is a heartfelt and heart wrenching story that will have you crying, laughing, swooning and smiling. I fell head over heels for Colton and have officially added him to my favorite Book Boyfriends of 2013!Maggie transforms herself to a tough rocker chick named Rain. She ran from her life as Maggie and has no plans on going back to her former life until tragedy strikes and she has no choice. She returns home to find that things haven't changed all that much--or she thinks. With the support of her band--specifically Colton she is able to make it through. On this journey though she discovers some things she never realized or knew about her family. How will Rain react to these new discoveries? It can go several ways but the only way to find out is if you read it!I loved Colton--as I mentioned above. He is another rocker but he is not your typical rocker dude. He really cares for Rain and wants her to be happy. He is patient with her and abides by Rain's strict rules that she doesn't date band members but how long can he really wait around for her to realize how he feels? He will do anything for her and shows that with his actions in the book. However, their relationship cannot stay this way forever something has to happen. Does Colton ever get the nerve to tell her how he feels? If so, how does Rain react?Favorite quotes and excerpts from the book:\u201cFor you, I think they'd do just about anything. When are you going to realize how many people love you?\u201d\u201cWhat the fuck is that,\u201d I shouted, a bit louder than I'd intended. Colton bolted upright in the bed, his eyes darting around the room trying to figure out what was going on. \u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d He asked, unable to hide the panic in his voice. I threw back the sheets to show him what was wrong, as if he didn't know, the bedroom door flew open exposing Colton to Jon and Travis.\"(by HB Heinzer)With fame come the haters. There is someone out to get Rain. Will that person succeed in bringing her down? Will her band--specifically Colton--stand beside her? Or will he believe what he's told? Can Rain survive yet another tragic event?I grew very attached to these characters and shed a few tears in this read. I had a hard time putting this book down. I highly recommend reading it.. You will love Colton and want more of him. Lucky us we get the chance to experience more Colton in the prequel Blessed Fate coming in May!!"}, {"userName": "Nicole Tetrev", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14479741-nicole-tetrev", "userReview": "Yes Please Keep the Rockstar Romances Coming!!!I was pleased this one was a little different you know with a girl being in the band.\nI loved Rain/Maddie she was insecure and unsure in Maddie but when it came to being Rain she totaly ahd her $hit together.Oh Man and Colton, where I can I even begin with him...

Female Rockstar.Finally! Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my sexy male rockstars but it is so refreshing to have a female take center stage.2. ColtonHe is a friend, lover and so incredibly patient. Yes, he screws up sometimes but it\u2019s how he handles himself that makes him a man. I absolutely adored him and I think many ladies will be adding him to their book boyfriend collection.3. Rain/MaddieWhile Rain is confident, Maddie is not. I loved the duality of her character and how she struggled to figure out who she is and what her place in the world is. I think a lot of us can relate to those situations.4. AngstHave you ever white-knuckled your kindle? I was left in states of grief, anger, sadness and fear of certain outcomes\u2026and I loved every second of it!5. The WritingI love when I can pick up a book and get lost in it\u2019s pages. For me, I was invested in from the first sentence to the very last. The characters were well developed, the story flowed, and I am excited to read more by H.B Heinzer.If your looking for angst, love, passion, friendship, and forgiveness then Blessed Tragedy is the book for you.4 stars*"}, {"userName": "Candice", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5218068-candice", "userReview": "[the band not believing Rain about the coke.

She is the youngest of four children and the only girl, and has been forced to play all of the \"girlie\" roles for her Mother, like being a cheerleader, pretending to love the colour pink, etc. She leaves the town and does not look back for years to come.Her dream has been to be in a band, and through some experiences along the way, she joins the band Blessed Tragedy and has changed her name to Rain Maxwell. She is the lead singer, and all the other members are guys, however, the one that she is closest to and is her best friend is Colton, they are even close enough that they sleep in the same bed every night, but it has all been strictly as friends till this point. The band has been doing really well and are gaining in popularity and fame, but just as it starts to peak for them, Rain gets a phone call that shakes her to the core, her Mother is sick with cancer.She has avoided going home for the past 5 years, she wants to leave that life behind her. She has stayed in contact with her parents over the phone over the years, and they have always told her that her Mom was doing okay with her treatment, and it wasn't that bad, so she decides that before she goes home, she wants to finish the current tour that they are on, she thinks that her Mom has enough time, and she will go home the day after the tour is over. Things change when Rain gets the phone call after their second to last tour stop, her Mom has passed away. Rain starts to fall apart, she feels incredibly guilty for not being there to say goodbye, then that guilt turns in to anger towards her Dad and brothers for not calling her. When she gets home there are some arguments that she has with her brothers and she is called a \"selfish bitch\" and told that she only thinks about herself all the time.The story takes off from there, and I really don't want to give anymore away because I really believe that this is a story that you have to experience for yourself to get all of the feels. There are so many different relationships that at first glance seem broken, and it is questionable whether they can ever be repaired. I loved the growth that a lot of the characters had in this novel, and seeing the give and take that they have to learn to get comfortable with. Also the ups and downs in the relationships that you think would automatically work so well is awesome. H.B Heinzer has done an amazing job at creating fantastic characters that are relatable and real, and imperfect. The situations and dramas that she comes up with are also very realistic and just proves that 1) most relationships are not easy, whether it be child/parent, brother/sister, or boyfriend/girlfriend, and they all need work to keep them going. And 2) not everything is as it seems, and sometimes you have to dig deep in to yourself, and those around you to see things from other perspectives before you can fully understand the whole story.I absolutely loved this book, and I am so happy that I have the privilege to be part of this blog tour, and also part of Blessed Fate's blog tour to see where this story goes, 5/5!"}, {"userName": "Books,Babes and Cheap Cabernet", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16379029-books-babes-and-cheap-cabernet", "userReview": "The \nBlessed Tragedy\n grabs you from the very beginning and is hard to put down. You find yourself sympathizing with the characters through their struggles and successes. I love a good rock star romance and this book does not disappoint. I enjoyed the fact that Rain/Maddie was a female lead singer in waht had been an all-male band. RainRain had spent the last 5 years avoiding going home at all cost. She was tired of being called a \"selfish bitch\" for making decisions that her family did not agree with. When tragedy forces her to return home, her bandmates, especially Colton, offer their support to her. Even offering to go along with her so she did not have to face her family alone. ColtonColton Bradford is Rain's bandmate and bestfriend. He has been in love with her since the moment he saw her. He has tried to get Rain to give him a chance for as long as he can remember, but Rain vowed to never get involved with anyone from the band. She fears that once the relationship goes awry, which she thinks its inevitable,it will completely change and complicate the dynamic of the band.  \"You are my everything and I'm terrified I'll screw that up. If that happens, not only do I lose my bestfriend, I risk tearing apart the band and losing all of my best friends.\"With being a rock star comes people trying to help you acheive your goals and those who want nothing more thatn to see you fail. In Rain's case thre is someone out make her life hell. She is forced to make decisions that change her life because of this person. Rain was a very frustrating character at times. She has this double persona thing going on. Whe she is Rain, she tends to be more self-assured, confident, and outspoken. Where as, when she is Maddie she tends to lose those qualities and becomes this insecure, mousy character that drove me up the wall at times. Poor Colton bears the brunt of her schizophrenic personality. I have such a Crush on Colton!!! <3 He deserves a spot on my 10 ten book boyfriends list. He is so good to Rain, whether she needed a friend or a lover he was there for her. Yes, he has faults and makes mistakes, I am not saying he is perfect, one of his mistakes was a really big one, but he makes up for it.  \" There is no question of if we'll work out. I know damn well that we will if you'll just let us.\" Oh Colton!!!!Overall, I really liked this story. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoi it for you guys, but I recommend that you read it. I found myself having trouble putting it down. Every story has two sides and I can't wait for \nBlessed Fate\n to come out and we get Colton's side of the story.

At the time, I laughed at the cheesy script; I wasn't laughing as I lifted my foot off the ground. When any kiss is as good as the one Colton gave me, it's nearly impossible to retain control of your body.\"Blessed Tragedy was one of those book surprises where you buy it not knowing what to expect but after reading the first chapter you're beyond seriously attached. It stole my heart, gave me butterflies, made me beyond angry and had me crushing alittle too hard. \"Okay, so you're a violin playing cheerleader who somehow turned into this badass tattooed and pierced rock Godess? What the F else are you hiding from us?\"I loved Maggie aka Moo aka Rain LOL Yes, she is Maggie/Moo to her family and Rain to her band and public. She is Stubborn, sweet, outspoken and everything I love in a character. What I really loved was she was a she, I am so use to reading about the badass tattooed rock boys that it was refreshing to have a female in that place. Not that there wasn't a badass tattoo wearing, pierced boy that didn't steal my heart because there wasn't one there are a couple.\"One of these days, I'm gonna stop being nice to these little skanks pawing at my man. That's right, bitches, Colton Bradford is my man, Mine, not yours. Get your nasty little fingers off him.\"Did I mention Colton, because the boy did stuff to me I only wish I could bottle and sell. He is a tattoo, pierced rocker but he is so not the typical rocker we read about every other day. He is patient and tender with Rain to the point it almost hurts. He loves her so unconditionally, he is beautiful and what I really love is that HB writes him as a real person. He is not perfect and he doesn't have a body to kill for but what he is has that attraction you can visualize and makes your heart skip a couple beats. \"And while I'd heard about having sex with a man whose cock was pierced, I was definitely looking forward to knowing firsthand if it was everything it was made out to be.\"\"worth the wait?\"\"Oh, hell yes,\" I sighed still unable to think straight.Oh yeah, he has one of those and yeah it is totally worth the wait to read about.I grew very attached to these characters and I might have cried a couple times. I read this book straight thru mainly because I couldn't get it out of my head when I tried to put it down and I without question recommend it to anyone who loves a Rockstar romance. You will love Colton but remember I already claimed him as mine but your lucky because I will totally let you borrow him. I cannot wait for June when Blessed Fate will be coming!! I don't think I will ever get enough of Blessed Tragedy (Told ya its a addiction I have no need to cure). I LOVE THEM and I love HB Heinzer for bringing them into my life. \"So, uh, how much do you guys love me?\"Travis laughed,\"Well, Jon and I like you an awful lot, but I think Colton's the only one here that loves you.\"Why thank you boys I LOVE YOU TOO!!!"}, {"userName": "Sugar and Spice Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14390665-sugar-and-spice-book-reviews", "userReview": "All I can say is that I really, really enjoyed this book. This is told from Maddy\u2019s POV. Reading the title, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. And I wasn\u2019t expecting to get grabbed by the front of my shirt and pulled into this book like I was. I\u2019m being honest, when I say I didn\u2019t want to put it down at all yesterday. I finished this in less than one day. What does that tell you??? I have read a lot of books in my lifetime and I loved the way this story flowed from the beginning, the characters came to life for me & I, at times, found myself experiencing some of the emotions that Maddy Neumann aka Rain Maxwell was feeling. 4 starsI don\u2019t want to give away any spoilers on this book. So let me give this a try\u2026\u2026Maddy is the only girl in the band called Blessed Tragedy. The other members are Colton, Travis & Jon. They\u2019ve been together for five years now & are on tour, as an opening act, when Maddy receives a call from one of her brothers. There has been a death in the family & Maddy needs to return home. During the time she\u2019s been away from home (5 yrs), her family relationship has been strained. She took off after graduating high school and never looked back. She rarely returns for visits either. Her family didn\u2019t give her their \u201cstamp of approval\u201d to pursuing her dream. Obviously, they wanted her to go to college. While some would call this being immature or maybe selfish, I respected her determination and taking a chance to do what she wanted to do. She forms a strong bond with the guys in the band and they\u2019ve been her \u201cfamily\u201d & her rock when needed.She gets some unexpected surprises on this return home and I think this helped heal some of her wounds. She also swore she\u2019d never get involved with any members of the band because she felt it would be hard to continue to be in it if they split up. I have to put my two cents in here and ask \u201cWhat was she numb this entire time being around Colton and just being friends?\u201d Well, I really admired how Colton held off on pursuing this friendship any further. Even when he knew he wanted her as more than a friend and waited until the time was right. Or where they pushed into it??This book takes you on tour with the band and at the end of it, when they finally get home to Portland, the band\u2019s bonds are tested. Do they work through it?? You\u2019ll have to read this book and find out for yourself. I highly recommend reading Blessed Tragedy. I cannot wait to read Blessed Fate which I\u2019m hoping is still on to be released in June. This is the first book I\u2019ve read by this author and it will NOT be my last.*Review by Jessie part of S&S Reviewing Team, ARC received in exchange for my honest review.

From the very beginning I thought this girl, Rain (Maddie), is going to be bad ass. I knew that the story was going to be told from a rocker girls POV, so I started reading the book expecting exactly just that- A rocker story but in a girls POV. When we were around my family, I was Maddie but here in my room, when it was just us, I was Rain.The main character Rain (Maddie) ran away from home to follow her dreams in becoming a rock star. Ever since she has developed two different personalities. This is one of the things I had a problem with. Why hide what you truly are? Just be who you want to be, and who you truly are. From the very beginning we get to know Rain- the rocker girl that has a family in her band mates-but we also get to know Maddie-sensitive, vulnerable, and caring.It seemed that everyone was working to meld my two families into one.I'd be lying if I said it wasn't nice to see my worlds meshing this way.A tragic event brings Rain back home to her family. This is were we get to see Maddie, because she transforms herself to the girl her family grew up knowing. Right after her arrival, her band mates met up with her. This is where the story flow got really slow. I just felt that the story was not going anywhere, and it was just stuck in this tragic event. Although, I did enjoy the connection and renuion between Rain, her family, and her band mates. Right after this the story flow starts to pick up :).I'd spent many months defending the platonic state of our personal relationship. And now, I was the one having thoughts about Colton that didn't fall into the friends category.Rain and Colton have an intimate relationship to a certain level that still categorizes as being in the friend zone. Does that make any sense? I seriously thought they were together when I read the first few scenes with them being really close to each other. Then Rain states from the very beginning that they are just friends! Back at Rain's hometown, Colton and Rain start falling out of the friend zone. I believe it is more than obvious from the very begging that these two are going to end up being together.\"I'll take someday.\" He gently lifted me, shifting our heads to the pillows. \"I'll take whatever I can get with you.\"I liked Colton's character. He is your typical rocker boy, but he is also sensitive, sweet, and cares so much for Rain. I will admit that I totally hated him in one part in the story. If a guy truly loves you he will never have doubts of what you say, and believe what others say about you. That is basically what happens with Colton. But then he does the most amazing thing to apologize for his actions. You will just have to read Blessed Tragedy to find out what happens ;D!True love means working through the mistakes to see if your love is strong enough to survive.H.B. Heinzer delivered an emotional roller coaster ride with Blessed Tragedy. There is lose, grief, romance, betrayal, and forgiveness. I cried, laughed, and feel in love with some of the characters in the book. By the end of Blessed Tragedy I was an emotional mess.H.B. Heinzer makes you think about finding out who you truly are, and how you can have the best of both worlds.The reason I gave this book 4 stars was that the beginning was very slow for me. The pace did not pick up until half of the book, and then it got really good. Another reason was that I had a few problems with Rain's character. Other than that this was a really great read. I will be reading Blessed Fate, because I want to hear the story from Colton's POV.Favorite Quotes:As I started singing the chorus, Colton's rich voice joined me in perfect harmony. We sat together on the stage floor through the rest of the song.There were five years of lost hugs to catch up on and only a couple of days to do it inHe'd bared his soul to me and I took his words and pulverized them.The curse was it was getting harder and harder to be around Colton without feeling the awkward tension growing between us.They might call it guy liner, but seriously, there is no 'guy liner' display at the store. It's eyeliner.\"Rule number one: always leave her wanting more.\" He laughed as I glared at him."}, {"userName": "Kar Achondo", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5764241-kar-achondo", "userReview": "I received a free copy of this book as part of the blog tour in exchange for an honest reviewDue to explicit sexual content and language, I'd recommend this book for mature readers (+18).Blessed Tragedy is the captivating story of Maddie Neumman -a normal and good girl raised to go to collage and have a normal job- and Rain Maxwell -a hardcore chick who is the lead singer of a rock band. The thing is, they're the same person. After graduation, Maddie decided to leave everything behind to pursue her dreams of having a music career and with that she broke her family's hearts. When her mothers dies, she has to come home and leave the only family she's known for the past five years -her band mates of Blessed Tragedy- to reconnect with the family she left behind all those years ago. Expecting to find the resentful stares she grown used to, she goes to say her last goodbyes to a mother who never understood her, but what's waiting for her is acceptance. The problem is... now that her family has come to terms with who Maddie is, can she accept herself? Does she even know who she is? On top of that, she's getting really close to his band mate, Colton, and even when she had sworn to herself she would never be involved with a band member in that way, she can't fight her feelings anymore and Colton has made clear that he feels the same way. Can the band survive the turmoil of emotions that this new relationship will bring? Maddie is a complex character, she's going through so much that you feel inclined to forgive her outburst and childness but sometimes you just want to shake her -hard- and make her see that she's the one in the wrong. Colton is a little bit too unmanly and I'm not trying to say that man are not supposed to have feelings but he was a bit too emotional for my taste, so I couldn't fall for him as much as I would like. I really loved the rest of the band members and Maddie's brothers, the only thing that bother me a little was that their names were too similar (Matt, Mike, Mark) and I'm really REALLY bad with names, so that confused me to the point that I couldn't tell you who is who.The romance in the novel was intense. If you're looking for a happy and healthy relationship, this book is not for you. There are a lot of issues, misunderstandings, hit-first-and-ask-questions-later kind of situations with this couple and sometimes you want to pull all your hair out because they're not making any sense. But even then, I really liked it, because it was an emotional roller coaster and it felt authentic, like a real life couple with problems and low points.The writing wasn't flawless but it was good enough for me. I enjoyed Maddie's point of view and her voice was nice and fresh. However, I'm looking forward to the second book on this series to see thing from Colton's POV and get a little more insight on Blessed Tragedy as a band, because even when music seems to be a huge topic in the story, there wasn't enough of the band work (such as the writing process, lyrics and musical arrangements) as I would have liked.Overall, I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down once I started it. I thik Blessed Tragedy is a great story about love, about coming to terms with who you really are and about forgiveness and acceptance of yourself and of the people you love."}, {"userName": "Laurie Treacy", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2675588-laurie-treacy", "userReview": "(Rating: 3.5)When I need a break from paranormal and fantasy, I check out contemporary romances (YA, NA or adult). One of my absolute favorite type of romance features musicians so when I read the synopsis for Blessed Tragedy, I knew it would be my kind of story. It was.Rain aka Maddie has escaped her mundane life for something more fulfilling and exciting--to live her dream. She's the lead singer of a rock band and the only girl. Pretty sweet gig. Colton is a guitarist (along with his band mates Jon and Travis) and he's had a thing for Rain ever since she joined the band five years ago. When Rain learns her mother has passed away, she heads home with mixed feelings. Her family (now just her dad and three older brothers) hasn't supported her career decision since she took off. At home, she discovers no one called her as her mother lay dying. Can she forgive her family for that?Going home is a common theme in movies and books. In Blessed Tragedy, going home is the start of an avalanche for Rain, a twenty five year old successful rocker. Lack of communication, distrust, acceptance--they all play a role in her story. Dealing with leaks to the press, an old boyfriend, brothers she didn't really know, and her own lack of understanding she can't do it all on her own are just some of the revelations she endures. Besides her real family, Rain also has to contend with her band family and their rigorous traveling schedule. She's fighting feelings for Colton, jealousy of their manager Tanya's relationship with the dreamy guitarist, wanting to become more productive in the songwriting, while coping with the lose of her mother proves to be too much for her. Rain lashes out, over indulges, runs her mouth and makes for an intriguing if frustrating character. It took time for me to like her. At twenty five I expected her to be mature. I did understand where she was coming from and soon found myself in her corner. She has fought to keep the real her (Maddie) from the celebrity her (Rain) for so long that she lost who she is. This story is her journey.There's music, family drama, band drama, couple drama, and much more. There were times the pacing slowed down due to too much exposition over Rain's emotional outbursts or thoughts. There were aspects of the story I wanted to see and not be told about (like how she joined the group). Also, for a story about musicians, I would have loved to have seen some lyrics and more of the songwriting at Colton's house. The concerts seemed glossed over instead of really digging in to convey the excitement and adrenaline of a live performance. What did Rain and Colton sing about in their acoustic song? I thought some parts seemed repetitive (thoughts repeated) and a few sentences sounded awkward, taking me out of the moment so I could reread it. As for the character, Rain grew on me as did Colton and the rest of his band. Rain's hotheadedness landed her in many situations and I was glad to see her actually begin to learn from her mistakes. Her transformation from a splintered personality into acceptance that it's okay to keep some of her old self as her career takes off was insightful. There are plenty of others to blame for some of her problems and they do step up to the plate over time. Over all, I enjoyed Blessed Tragedy and look forward to reading Colton's story in Blessed Fate.

Heinzer excepting another rock n\u2019 roll love story. So I was surprised as I was hardly into the first few chapters when Maddie/Rain\u2019s family appeared. I think it\u2019s fitting the main character had two names, Madeline, or Maddie, as she was called by her family, and Rain who she became after she left home. The two names are fitting because Blessed Tragedy is almost two stories. It\u2019s a story about Maddie and her relationship with her family, but also Rain and her relationship with Colton. The story begins with Maddie having to go home for her estranged mother\u2019s funeral. Maddie had only been back a handful of times since she left home after she graduated high school. Maddie left home to pursue her music and \u201clive my life on my own terms\u201d. Maddie\u2019s transformation from the blond hair little girl her parents knew, to red haired, pierced, tattooed, combat boot wearing rockstar Rain, didn\u2019t go over very well. In fact the first time her mother saw \u201cRain\u201d she started crying, and not the, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you\u201d kind of crying either.The storyline with Maddie\u2019s family is very interesting and I think it spoke to how many teens may view their family. While Maddie\u2019s family may have had some reservations about her new look and choice of career, that didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t proud of her. It was hard to see Maddie realize that she had missed out on so much time with her family just because they weren\u2019t able to communicate.Now on to the romance! Colton and Rain have been \u201cclose\u201d friends since they met. They sleep in the same bed, hold each other\u2019s hand, and are each other\u2019s best friend. They\u2019re basically a couple without any of the, ehm, benefits. As Rain deals with the emotional fallout of her mother\u2019s death, she begins to finally realize that Colton is so much more to her than a friend. I loved seeing their relationship take the leap from friends to lovers. Colton was absolutely the sweetest thing! He truly did worship Rain. If only love really could conquer all things.While I enjoyed this story I did have a few problems. People and storylines seemed to come and go with no reason. I had to look back through the book a few times to make sure I hadn\u2019t missed anything. Characters (Mike) who didn\u2019t seem important were suddenly an important part of the plot. It got to be a bit confusing at times. Overall I enjoyed Blessed Tragedy. I\u2019m glad H.B. Heinzer mixed it up a bit and brought in Maddie/Rain\u2019s family. And I\u2019m definitely glad we got to meet Colton and the rest of the band. I\u2019m excited to read the rest of their stories, and continue rockin\u2019 with Blessed Tragedy!For more amazing reviews check out Love Between the Sheets at http://www.readlovelust.com/"}, {"userName": "Jessie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5929246-jessie", "userReview": "All I can say is that I really, really enjoyed this book. This is told from Maddy\u2019s POV. Reading the title, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. And I wasn\u2019t expecting to get grabbed by the front of my shirt and pulled into this book like I was. I\u2019m being honest, when I say I didn\u2019t want to put it down at all yesterday. I finished this in less than one day. What does that tell you??? I have read a lot of books in my lifetime and I loved the way this story flowed from the beginning, the characters came to life for me & I, at times, found myself experiencing some of the emotions that Maddy Neumann aka Rain Maxwell was feeling. 4 starsI don\u2019t want to give away any spoilers on this book. So let me give this a try\u2026\u2026Maddy is the only girl in the band called Blessed Tragedy. The other members are Colton, Travis & Jon. They\u2019ve been together for five years now & are on tour, as an opening act, when Maddy receives a call from one of her brothers. There has been a death in the family & Maddy needs to return home. During the time she\u2019s been away from home (5 yrs), her family relationship has been strained. She took off after graduating high school and never looked back. She rarely returns for visits either. Her family didn\u2019t give her their \u201cstamp of approval\u201d to pursuing her dream. Obviously, they wanted her to go to college. While some would call this being immature or maybe selfish, I respected her determination and taking a chance to do what she wanted to do. She forms a strong bond with the guys in the band and they\u2019ve been her \u201cfamily\u201d & her rock when needed.She gets some unexpected surprises on this return home and I think this helped heal some of her wounds. She also swore she\u2019d never get involved with any members of the band because she felt it would be hard to continue to be in it if they split up. I have to put my two cents in here and ask \u201cWhat was she numb this entire time being around Colton and just being friends?\u201d Well, I really admired how Colton held off on pursuing this friendship any further. Even when he knew he wanted her as more than a friend and waited until the time was right. Or where they pushed into it??This book takes you on tour with the band and at the end of it, when they finally get home to Portland, the band\u2019s bonds are tested. Do they work through it?? You\u2019ll have to read this book and find out for yourself. I highly recommend reading Blessed Tragedy. I cannot wait to read Blessed Fate which I\u2019m hoping is still on to be released in June. This is the first book I\u2019ve read by this author and it will NOT be my last.*Review by Jessie part of S&S Reviewing Team, ARC received in exchange for my honest review.

If you don't know me than you probably might not know is the more intense the better. Yes, this book did it for me and I loved the story. It had the perfect amount of love, angst, loss, and heartbreak all in one.Maddie is part of the band Blessed Tragedy. She doesn't go by the name Maddie anymore everyone knows her as Rain Maxwell tough rocker chick. The opposite of what she was before she left after her high school graduation. Ever since her change she has been estranged from her family. Then tragedy strikes and she has to go back home. She doesn't like having to be separated from her current family, her band mates are her rock. They know her, and they understand her. Especially Colton her very best friend and the one she cares for the most. Their relationship is based on friendship but Colton has always wanted more. Rain refuses to get involved with anyone in the band, for fear of ruining a good thing she has with all of them. But when she needs his love and comfort the most will lines finally be crossed? Will they give in to the feelings they have been hiding for years? So yeah, this is about rock stars, very dedicated and determined rock stars. I so love that Rain is part of the band. She is a force to be reckoned with. Unfortunately some people don't approve of her and try to get in the way of her happiness. We don't care for those people! In all seriousness Colton and Rain were so perfect. They are so close that even when they aren't together everyone thinks they are. They have a unique chemistry that some of us dream of. He is so sweet and loving towards her, you just can't help but fall in love with him. Rain gives him everything she is. She cares for him so much that she decides to follow her heart and take a chance on him. That chance changes the dynamics of things and we get a glimpse at how strained a relationship that is in the spotlight is. Colton and Rain are fighters and don't give up on each other. I believe there love is so strong it could withstand anything. Now they have some rough times to say the least, but they have some of the happiest moments that I have ever read. This book is definitely a keeper.If you love angsty rock stars, and a love that will make you weep. please consider giving this book a good sit down read. I fell in love with it! It had all the good qualities that I look for in a book. You may even become emotionally attatched to these characters and never want to let them go."}, {"userName": "Triin from T's Bookish Moments", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4483565-triin-from-t-s-bookish-moments", "userReview": "From my blog.\n**ARC provided by author for an honest review**\nWanna know the main reason I wanted to read this book? I've lately been fascinated, maybe even obsessed with rockers and rock bands. (It may or may not have little something to do with something I myself am writing right now...). This book, however, managed to blow up all of my expectations. Honestly? The first three paragraphs were the hardest for me to read... Then, suddenly, I could no longer put it down, not even for a moment. Calling Blessed Tragedy a romance novel would be kind of wrong... Now, don't get me wrong - we do have a love story. But the book itself was so, so much more. I'd call it a story of... Healing, perhaps? Healing of a family. Healing of Maddie. I loved seeing Maddie's life coming back together. Every single moment of it was touching and beautiful (in big, fat tears kind of way, of course...). Just like Rain, I started out by hating her family for everything they'd done, then... Fall in love doesn't seem like the best expression to use, but that's what I did... I fell in love with her brother and her father, even her mother. \"Fall\" because it was so sudden... I didn't even want to like any of them, but somehow I ended up wanting to adopt her family...Blessed Tragedy. Maddie's other family. Colton, Jon, and Travis. Her band. And I have to say I really want to adopt them too... Like, how can one person have TWO so amazing families... That's unfair, ya know... Now, when it comes to Colton, I'm definitely waiting for his book. First of all, because I'm still not sure if I love him. He pulled some serious shit and even though I did love him at the beginning, my feelings changed during the book. Second, because I just want to get inside his head. That's the moment I share my hope that he'll still look like a man after his own book (after all, too much sappiness kills a man ;) ). But after Blessed Tragedy, I think that I don't need to be too afraid of that...Should you read it? Definitely should. I loved every moment of this story and I loved the characters. It's a brilliant one I'm happy I didn't miss out on."}, {"userName": "Ali's Books", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18452733-ali-s-books", "userReview": "Blessed Tragedy is a great suspenseful romance about a girl struggling to discover who she is. It sucks you right in from the start and doesn\u2019t let go.Madeline \u201cMaddie\u201d Neumann graduated high school, left home without a word, and reinvented herself as Rain Maxwell, hardcore rocker chick. The story picks up just after Rain learns her mother has died. She\u2019s about to head home for the funeral, and you quickly learn the dynamics of Rain\u2019s realtionship with her other bandmates, which are all guys, as she\u2019s preparing to leave. The guys all treat Rain like she\u2019s family, but she has a special relationship with fellow bandmate Colton. He\u2019s been in love with her for a long time, but Rain is completely against mixing business with pleasure this way. The boys end up following Rain home where she begins to struggle with her identity. She also starts to find it impossible to continue to ignore what her relationship with Colton has become.Heinzer did an EXCELLENT job developing all the characters. I felt like I knew them well, and their actions and dialogue always reflected their personalities. Rain\u2019s character was explosive, and it was reflected in her very strong language, and the explicit scenes described.The plot was persistently intriguing and suspenseful. At times I wanted to reach in and smack Rain over her decisions, and I would be on the edge of my seat in fear of the consequences of those decisions. The build up got so intense that I felt sure there would be an explosion. The only thing I personally would have changed was the ending. I was pleased with it, but it didn\u2019t seem to have the bang the rest of the book built up to. I wouldn\u2019t have changed the end result of the plot, just maybe the way the end was presented. Like I said, though, that was the ONLY thing at all I\u2019d have changed. This book was a very strong 4 stars for me \u2013 bordering on 5.

You know what all rocker books lack??? Female characters in the band\u2026 Well, I was so pleasantly pleased when reading Blessed Tragedy because both the characters are in the band and they are both bad ass. Rain AKA Madeline ran away from home years ago to pursue a music career that no one in her family approved of. Years later, her and her band mates are famous rock stars living the life until Rain has to return home to attend her mother\u2019s funeral. Tensions run high because Rain no longer feels welcome and hasn\u2019t, thus her long sabbatical from home. Standing on the sidelines is Colton, Rain\u2019s band mate and number one fan. Though the two are the best of friends, Rain is beyond hesitant to start anything that will A.) ruin the band and B.) ruin their friendship. Needless to say Colton is and has been in love with Rain since the beginning, so watching her suffer and not being able to help is the hardest thing for him. Rain/Madeline gets a pleasant surprise whilst at home and being with her family turns out to be an OK thing. Sure the past still lies above their heads but the loss they all share works to bring them together. Of course Colton\u2019s rocker hotness cannot be denied forever and the two start dating. Old fears and past behaviors put bumps in the road for Rain and Colton, in ways that will alter everyone\u2019s lives and they have to find the will to work through or move on. I really felt for Rain, the entire story, and seeing things from her POV was great because not only is she a rock goddess but also a grieving daughter trying to find out if loving her best friend is worth the effort. I can easily say it is and the book was everything a rock star romance should be. I definitely recommend this book and cannot wait to read Blessed Fate which is in Colton\u2019s POV."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11518361-karen", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. It was interesting to have a book told from the female rocker perspective. Maddie (aka Rain) left home right out of high school to pursue her dream of becoming a rock star. This book interested me from the viewpoint in that I love a good rocker book. However, this wasn\u2019t really about that aspect of Maddie\u2019s life, and wasn\u2019t a typical rock star romance. Instead the author wrote a story about family, either the one you\u2019re born with or the one that comes into your life by choice, acceptance, forgiveness and love. There is romance. Colton is one of Maddie\u2019s closest friends and band-mate. He is there with her through everything. They are as much of a couple as they can be, but without the sex. Although, as Colton stands by Maddie while she reconnects and deals with her family and the life she thought she lost, they realize that their relationship is so much more.HB Heinzer did a good job with the storytelling and I liked her writing style. She offered an interesting and unique story. While I enjoyed this book there were parts of the story or characters that felt out of place in the book, which I didn\u2019t feel really added any significance. The pace felt a little slow, but the developing story held my interest. I also felt there were parts of the story told in detail that could have been shorter. The characters were likable, but not strongly defined. The story had some emotional parts but didn\u2019t result in a strong emotional connection. I\u2019m looking forward to reading more from this author and book 2 Blessed Fate, which is Colton\u2019s point of view.
