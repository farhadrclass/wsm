The cover reminded me so much of my childhood, visiting my grandmother on her farm; the old porch where we used to sit, she peeling and slicing fruit for bottling, telling me stories of the family and her childhood. I was too young to remember who finally took her rockin' chair when she passed away, but it never bothered me. I had so much rich and beautiful memories whenever I encountered a rockin' chair ever since.This family saga of the old gentleman, John McCarthy and his family pulled me into the American way of rural life which we often see in movies, but seldom read in books. The characters in the book were so familiar as though I knew them all my life, yet so very American in their values, talk and outlook on life. Decent, honest folks who were paternally lead and protected by a grandpa who also wrote a diary.The writing style, the story elements, the characters...everything, gripped me from the first sentence before I even knew what the story would be about. I only knew I wanted to learn the story behind that rockin' chair on that porch and I was determined to hear it! It was as though the author knew where to get to me. He went straight for the heart and left me sitting in total wonderment on how it was done.Who would not react emotionally when a simple, decent, proud man writes these words:\"I've had dreams of Alice calling me home and I reckon my time is close. But I'd leaved a pig-headed fool without makin' a few things clear. I reckon I've lived a life most men could only hope for. I had folks that taught me right. I found a woman that loved me right. I worked a farm that treated me right. But none of it ever added up to the love I had for my boy, Hank. Even if I owned words fancy enough, I couldn't start to say how much I love that stubborn boy.\" The symbolism in the Rockin' chair is strong enough to have everyone reading this book yearn for family we never knew, or who passed away, or for opportunities we wished we had treasured. We would all agree that those rockin' chairs was more than just a few pieces of wood that made up a useful piece of furniture! It really rocked for a special reason. They all have stories to tell. This Rockin' Chair had me in tears - of memory but also of joy. I felt so part of this family in which the challenges of a tough life, misunderstandings, and hardship did not leave much room for emotions such as love and appreciation. Yet it does not mean it did not exist. It is a brilliant book in so many ways. It is a book that men should read just as eagerly as women. There is a lot to contemplate and a lot of our own changed values to weigh against the message this book leaves behind. In the end I needed to ask myself: and how do you measure up, girl?Five stars for everything, grampa John!"}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2600090-kathryn", "userReview": "This was a calm laid back book with a deep under story.

She has the end stage of dementia and other health problems.Alice is dying and John wants to get the family together to say goodbye.

Over the course of seven months after all three kids decide to stay in Montana with grandpa John, things slowly start to change. Grandpa John helps the grandkids with the issues they each came with. offers advice.Slowly John and his son start to communicate about the problems and heal the rift between them. I like the story that Steven Manchester tells. it is one I can relate to. how many of us wish we could talk things out hear what we need to hear from relatives. the \"I love you's\" the characters need to hear. each of the character have their own issues that slowly each get help and advice. the Rocking chair in the story has it's part as well. since each relative has their named carved in the chair from Grandpa John.

In TWELVE MONTHS he brought to us the changes that occur in the man who has been given a certain time to live after a diagnosis of cancer is realized. In THE ROCKIN' CHAIR he again deals with en of life situations and how the coming together of a family at the time of death of a grandparent resurrects memories - and the value of dealing with memories that may have been both sad and happy.Manchester wisely opens his story with a confusing view of Alice, the grandparent of the story as in her senility she walks through the past addressing her fears and her dreams and her expectations, allowing us at first to believe we are meeting a young girl, a young woman as she begins her life, only to ultimately realize that this is the fragile dismembering mind of a elderly woman approaching death.But Alice is not the true main character of the book: that role is absorbed by old John McCarthy, her husband, living out his life on this Montana farm. It is when Alice, his beloved wife, succumbs that he calls his family home and the story is Grandpa John's orchestrating the resolution of memories that need to be both recalled and resolved. Each family member brings to the wise foot of Grandpa John's rocking chair those moments in their lives that have been struggles and it is in the loving wisdom of Grandpa john that the memories are tended and mended.Manchester is able to deliver difficult messages in a manner that signifies he is wise beyond his years. Each novel grows. He will be around for a long time if there are more stories like this one to share.

This book, 'The Rockin' Chair', has provoked in me such strong emotions that I have not felt from a book, in awhile. This was my very first reading of Steven Manchester--it will not be my last--and I will absolutely recommend for anyone to read his books. What an experience that I was carried on! I cried tears of joy and sadness...experienced every single hurt, every doubt, every misunderstanding and pleading, every self-degradation, joy and peace, all the pleasure and happiness. I experienced a family...a family that is full of regrets, time wasted, broken, but put back together again. There was not a facet in this family that I could not see myself in or a family member. For me, it was truly a God-send to read this book. You'll find \"old fashioned\" values here. Through all the pain and sorrow, came life, joy, peace, faith, and lessons learned. I enjoyed reviewing this story...thank you Steven for the honor in doing so. What a blessing it brought to me. Thank you. These characters in this story, were so well thought out and carried through to the end, that the avid reader will not be disappointed. The story flows very smoothly and to the Grammar sticklers out there (you know who you are LOL)-I'm very pleased to report-thumbs up!! I bet your curious about the story huh? How many of us have misjudge our parents-one wrong word and they 'don't love us', one wrong action or the lack of action and 'they don't care'? How many parents are to focussed on being right, instead of hearing what their child is trying to say? Have you loved someone, that didn't love you back...broken your heart and used you all up, though the signs were there all along, but ignored...made you question your self value-your worth? Do you know a Veteran who's 'broken'? Have you ever lost Faith in God? Questioned Him? This book is the one for you! Now those who know me, know that I'm not one for \"spoilers\" when giving my views and usually I tease and suggest that the book be read in order to experience it. Spoilers are like telling the ending to a movie, before it is even half way through. I love to share how a book-a story, has moved and touched me...how it has affected and provoked me. And I am telling y'all straight, here and now that, 'The Rockin' Chair', is worth every moment of your time. A wonderful-truly wonderful story!!"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3356446-carol", "userReview": "I have read both Twelve Months and GoodNight Brian by Steven Manchester and loved them so much. Mr. Manchester consistently writes books that are treasures that speak to the heart and teach us what is important in life. The Rocking Chair is third of his books that I find a deeply personal connection. A major theme that runs through Stephen Manchester\u2019s books is the importance of family. This book is no different. The Rocking Chair includes four generations of family. At the beginning of this story, Alice McCarthy has Alzheimer\u2019s. She has been loved so much by husband, John and her son and all the grandchildren. Now she can no longer recognize any of them, including her husband. That breaks John\u2019s heart so much. The more memory that she loses the more lost he feels. Most of John\u2019s thinking is done in the rocking chair. A lot of memories come back and we learn about his son, Hank and his three children, Tara, George and Evan. Each one of them has a crisis in their life even though John isn\u2019t aware of it. John decides that he needs all of the family to come back for his wife\u2019s funeral. As they arrive, he becomes aware that he and his son Hank are not the only ones in anguish. I love this book because the author is very careful to tell about the family with realism and with love. This book is so moving that I wanted to know more of what happened to this family when the book was over. Heartbreak, forgiveness and love run throughout this book.  There is one more reason that this book is special to me. There is a poem in the back of the book named The Rocking Chair that really touched me personally. Many years ago, I found some of my father\u2019s poetry and my favorite of his was The Rocking Chair. Both poems are of love, one of my father\u2019s love for my mother and the other in the book was of a father\u2019s love of his son.I highly recommend this book to all of my friends and to anyone who likes to read about families.I received this book from Providence Book Promotions in exchange for an honest review, but that in no way influenced my review.

Something was wrong with Alice. In the beginning, I couldn't decipher whether she was dreaming or crazy. The first chapter had me confused with the constant back-and-forth notion\u2015but that is usually the way it feels with Alzheimer's. The chair was a tombstone of cherished memories and forgotten lives. It was the thing that always provided John with comfort and pensive sorrow. Lately, he has been sitting for long hours, quietly rocking in a paralyzed state with his mind full of worry and fear over the disease that has been taking his beloved Alice away. It was stated simply that \"[Alice] had become an apparition in the flesh, a ghost locked within the familiar frame.\" (25) The story was nothing but memories that get dragged out by every member of the family and play on the minds like a broken record. Each section was recited in the POV of every main character, each one bringing one more demonic skeleton out of the closet that wrecked havoc on the emotions. The book was mainly a typhoon of emotions circling around the Alzheimer's, the war, and loss. To think that family was the magical cure for life's problems was kind of naive. However, I liked how each character's flaws were rendered with emphatic resonance and frail honesty. Big John's barnyard lessons were cleverly correlated with the kids' problems. Suddenly it was up to Big John to fix them all like if he was Jesus or something, which was probably why there was a lot of praying in the story. Ultimately, this story was all about getting over loss and heart ache\u2015in other words, \"to get back on the horse.\" Manchester's words painted a vibrant picture of the dirt-slappin', fly-swattin' country farm life of Montana. However, his descriptions of emotions might have been a tad too \"fruity\" for my taste. Now I get the Nicholas Sparks reference."}, {"userName": " Gigi Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2511429-gigi-ann", "userReview": "This is the second book I've read by Steven Manchester, the first book being \"Goodnight Brian.\" This book is a book about a family traveling down the highway of life, and all of a sudden they have arrived at a fork in the road. Which way to turn, to the one leading to healing and happiness, or the rocky road leading to misunderstandings and sadness? This was a very emotional book, the story begins with sadness, as we read about John's wife, and the struggles the family had dealing with his wife's Alzheimer's. Then, we begin to learn about each family member, and the problems they are each facing. How they each arrived on the winding road that lead to their present situation in life, and the twists and turns that helped them to continue down the highway to a happy life...all with the help of Grandpa John's guidance and wisdom.There are happy heartfelt moments as they reminisced about things that happened in their lives. But there were times when the tears appeared as I was reading the story. I like the way the story came together in the end. It was very endearing, but also bittersweet.

Grandpa John is the patriarch: he creates and sits in the eponymous rocking chair; he always has a pithy observation based on the natural world around him to solve any of life's problems.I did not come to care about these characters, although the range of different struggles were interesting if predictable and some of the specific (but rare) examples of family bonding were endearing. Ultimately, however, the sweetness too often spilled over into sappy and the sudden conversions/solutions were unrealistic. The novel opens with a comparatively long review of one character's suffering and demise due to the debilitation that is Alzheimer's, and seemed to be in part a teaching device to educate readers who might not be familiar with the disease. I briefly scanned the introductions of two other novels by the same author being promoted at the end of this e-text and noted they both began with a deep analysis of a terrible illness one character suffers as a way to educate readers.

The book is completely benign, bland, and harmless, but it's one not-that-long (200 pages) platitude and completely predictable, which is likely what its intended audience prefers.The book opens with the main character, all-knowing wise Grampa John, looking on as his beleaguered daughter-in-law cares for his wife, who suffers from dementia. For some reason, the dementia kills her suddenly (this is not medically true) and he also suddenly sees that his son, daughter-in-law, and three grandchildren are suffering from a damaged marriage, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, and a failed engagement. Grampa John dispenses folksy wisdom and his family comes back together with little difficulty.You'll find some jarring grammatical and spelling errors. One that particularly stood out for me was when a character grabbed a cow's utters, and then a page later uttered something. Oh dear. There is plenty of this in the book if you enjoy that sort of thing. Very little of what these characters do is true to life. If you're someone who likes short, happy endings, Hallmark Channel movies, or Nicholas Sparks, you might enjoy this, and I wouldn't disparage you for it.

His writing for this fictional story was wonderful!This story is very captivating! The novel was a easy read and it was very easy to stay interested from the first paragraph to the very last sentence.Mr. Manchester goes into great deal describing each of the McCarthy family members. I felt like I knew Grandpa John and I had a very clear picture of what he and the rest of the family looked like. His descriptions are very detailed. However, he doesn't focus on one point on an extended period of time. This family could easily be any family. All families have unsaid problems, hurts, memories, and things that should be aired before it's too late.This book is a great reminder of how short life is and if we keep things inside, before you know it, it will be too late.You will learn about Grandpa John, Alice and their son Hank and his family.This story also talks about Alzheimer's. I started crying more than once throughout the book.I highly recommend this book!

But, the forces of nature often change the position of this tree trunk and years of standing out in the cold, sun, rain, storms or snow and the heavy force of the wind might even shift this foundation and force it to tilt. Each branch on this precious tree is covered with leaves to protect it and keep it warm but when the harsh winter winds blow, the season\u2019s change the branches are once again left to deal with nature. Life can hand us many difficult situations. Each person handles strife, despair, unhappiness, loss of loved ones, jobs that are unfulfilling and even fear in their own way. With the help of families and friends most pull through but when stubbornness, anger, harsh realities and hard times settle in and people push themselves away from those that really care what you get is a disjointed tree that once held some strong branches each with its own special memories now shattered, torn from the very heart of the tree where it once stood tall. John and Alice McCarthy met at a special dance and have never stopped dancing since they set eyes on each other. Life was good at first and they were blessed with a son, Hank that they both adored. But, Hank\u2019s perception of his father was not what we see as we meet John at the start of this novel. Time has passed, words have been said and the harsh feelings seemed to be settled within Hank and cannot be released. John\u2019s life on his farm has always centered on Alice. Hank never felt that his father really needed him for anything and when he met Elle he did not realize that was the best day of his life. Foundations are the cement that keeps buildings in place, trees from falling, and families from crumbling. But, when the foundation begins to wear away and the limbs blow in different directions what you get is a tree with broken branches each trying to repair its damage, each trying to rebuild its original frame and hopefully restoring its glory. Memories are precious except when they begin to fade within the recess of your mind. The story opens in a heartfelt and heart wrenching way with one woman\u2019s disjointed thoughts, memories and life being replayed within what is left of her mind as she drifts slowly away. Alzheimer\u2019s is a death sentence for the poor victim whose mind it decides to invade and destroy. Slowly, methodically and carefully it wears away at the person\u2019s brain cells until what is left is nothing. Causing the loss of brain tissue and cell death in the person with this disease anyone looking within the brain of the person would see plagues, made up of fragments of beta-amyloid protein and tangles comprised of dead and dying neurons which become twisted and collage when tau. A normal brain protein becomes abnormal. How long before the end varies as I know because my mom lived with this illness for ten years. Some people live with it on the average for 8 years and some over 20. There is no cure for this illness and no real test to predict who will get it. Researchers have not found anything to prevent or permanently stop it as yet. Alice McCarthy was diagnosed with this dreaded illness and although John is doing his best along with his daughter-in-law to care for her his family is what he needs at this time and his hopes for reunite them would make whatever time Alice has left more meaningful for her, him and hopefully rebuild the foundation that is tilting on that very tall tree. Hearing the voices of each character we get to understand their feelings, grief, desires, successes and failures. John\u2019s life centered on Alice and his goal was to provide for her and his young son, Hank. But, things changed, feelings set aside and they drifted apart. Although Hank still lives on the farm he and his father are live many world\u2019s apart. Part hurts; feelings and stubbornness within Hank caused him to become cold, hard, unhappy and bitter. Without Elle, he would probably spend more of his days in a drunken stupor. As Hank contemplates his life and reflects on his three children little does he know that the foundations of their lives have crumbled and that they are finding their way home to hopefully repair more than just their broken hearts. Someone betrayed Evan, a writer he thought he could trust. Tara, his twin sister, decided to live in New York and soon became disillusioned, drug dependent and believed in one man that would turn against her when she revealed something that he did not want to hear. George, a decorated soldier, received the medal of valor and turned it down for reasons that most would disagree with yet, his conscience could not ignore what he felt was right. Three broken branches each needing repair and each about to find its way home to as they say to the homestead hopefully to find even more. The Rocking Chair is the story of one woman named Alice who gave her life for her family only to wind up living alone within the recesses of her mind surrounded by her past, not able to relate to the present and little time left in the future. Author Steven Manchester brings to light what happens when someone is struck with Alzheimer\u2019s, how it affects the family, how one man deals with helping his wife live out the rest of her time with dignity and how remembering the past will help him embrace the present. Some of us have a favorite place to sit, contemplate and unwind. As John places Alice on his lap one more time her final breath is taken and she leaves this world to join G-d in his. But, this is not just a story about Alice it is much more as we learn more about Tara, Evan, Elle, Hank, John and George each having to come face to face with their own demons, their own conflicts and hopefully resolving, forgiving those that have hurt them and moving ahead before it\u2019s too late. As John is determined to hear what Alice tried to convey to him at her funeral, he makes the first move to mend what he can and help his grandchildren find peace and a better place in this world. But, what about Hank, just why does he resent and hate his father as the author shares his story with readers you will find yourself with tears rolling down your eyes and understanding his pain but hoping he will let it go. Imagine a quilt each with its own special squares each square telling its own story. One that would take us back to when John and Alice met and their life together and that special rocking chair where his family would gather round to hear his stories. Another square for Hank, his early years, his memories of growing up, the fire that caused him to leave home and the one thing that might mend his heart. Evan and George share a square as Evan has to come to grips with losing the one person he thought was the love of his life only to find his way back home, hear his grandfather\u2019s words and learn to move on. George learns forgiveness in another way and the end result for him would hopefully grant him so peace and understanding of something that has haunted him for too long. Tara whose world is centers around drugs, alcohol and bad decisions has her own special square that is filled with her past, her mistakes and hopefully a renewed start if she decides to get some help. Elle deserves her own square as she is more like the glue that keeps it all together and the one person who sees every situation for what it really is. But, can she awaken Hank and bring him back to the present and out of the past in order to focus on a better future? One final square for precious Lila: the first of a new generation. When the story draws to a close make sure you have plenty of tissues. One man whose goal was to mend as many hearts, fix as many problems and prove that love, forgiveness, hope and faith can bring the branches of this tree back to their original form and hopefully rebuild that foundation so the trunk does not tip over anymore. Alzheimer\u2019s cannot be cured. \u201cFamily is the foundation for Everything.\u201d Never let time pass between visits, call those that matter and tell them, never let hate, anger and the past take away the time that you have in the future. Read the beautiful poem the last page: Evan McCarthy: the rocking chair as he hoped to fulfill his goal and write that book he promised his grandfather he would write to be the voice of so many whose lives and voices would otherwise be silenced. As Evan finds his way to becoming a writer what about Tara, George, Hank and Elle? Read the Rocking Chair, hear John\u2019s voice tell his stories, listen to Alice\u2019s laugh and create your own dreams. This is a heartfelt story that teaches everyone the importance of so many issues that the author has brought to light and I have spotlighted in this review. Author Steven Manchester\u2019s research into Alzheimer\u2019s, his understanding of what happens when someone needs help with addictions and family counseling brings all of these issues and much more to light in this outstanding book.

I had to stay up last night in order to finish it, and I cried for several minutes. But it was worth it! This is a must-read book for anyone who has ever been a grandparent or had one. I think that takes into account just about everyone, right?My words cannot do this book justice. Steven is a master in the art of writing narratives that truly affect his readers. He doesn't write historical fiction, romances, thrillers, or mysteries. His stories are poignant, stunning, engaging, and authentic. In short, his book are real. The reader will find some profanity in the book, but I honestly never felt offended. In fact, the author's dedication completely inspired me. The faith that is depicted in this book is raw and genuine and often a little rough around the edges. But it is enduring. Steven's characters are not just the typical, two-dimensional characters that I have found in so many supposed inspirational stories. If I can say this, his characters are four-dimensional. They are living. The reader does not feel like a spectator but a participant.I am so glad I was honored to read this book. The description of Alzheimer's were fascinating, but the issue of death really touched me. I recently lost my grandmother, and this book was a wonderful way for me to deal with that grief. At my grandmother's funeral, I also felt I was able to say goodbye to my grandfather since I never could attend his funeral sixteen years ago. I can't thank Steven for sharing his heart with his readers.I was sent a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

From beginning to end, the story captured my heart with the good old fashioned story telling that the author managed to wrap into one beautiful package. An amazing read!The character of John McCarthey, aka Grampa John, touched my heart. Sometimes referred to as a stubborn, old codger, Grampa John is facing loneliness. His wife of many years, Alice, is close to dying with the dreaded disease, Alzheimers. His world is about to collapse and all he can do is sit back and watch it happen. Alice has been cheated one of life's greatest gifts, her memories, and is fast becoming no more than a shadow of the past. As Alice's condition worsens, John decides it is time to call his family home - his three grand kids, Georgey, Evan, and Tara - to say their goodbyes. And the story unfolds ----Over the years, Grampa John has carved four names into the seat of \"the Rockin Chair,\" - Hank, Georgey, Evan and Tara. From early on they'd all spent their childhoods rocking, laughing and learning to love. Grampa John isn't ready for the promised land until he knows these four loved ones have found peace in their lives and family problems are resolved. There is mending to be done before he can join Alice in eternity. After reading this book, I was left with a warm feeling. An absolutely wonderful read you will not want to miss.

The Rockin\u2019 Chair by Steven Manchester is another must read. It is also a fast read as well. This is the second book I have read by Mr. Manchester. The theme I am finding with his books are the characters. He writes them with so much life as if they are real people and not just people in a book. John was the real superstar of this story. He is the foundation that the family was built around. There was not one person that I did not like. I could connect with each of them. I grew so close to the family that when the ending came to a near that I could not help but shred a tear or two. These people pulled at my heart strings.
