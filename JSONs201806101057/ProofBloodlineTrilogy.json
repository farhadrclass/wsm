Or Without A Trace, except chronologically from the missing person's point of view. But here's an original twist: we know who the villain is only a third of the way through the book. From there, the stakes just keep rising, and the crime investigation is enriched by some fascinating medical details.For me, the only things missing from this novel are deep point of view and deeper characterization. When the point of view stays on the surface, I can't engage on an emotional/character level, only an intellectual/plot level. That said, this is one of the most interesting, unexpected plots I've read from Christian fiction in ... practically ever. It never lets up, pretty much from page one. Kept me curious, and I will definitely read Ms. Redwood's next book. If she deepens point of view in subsequent books, I'll be even happier.Recommended if: You enjoy plot-driven fiction, un-sanitized Christian fiction, crime and/or medical suspense."}, {"userName": "Caitlyn Santi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6980753-caitlyn-santi", "userReview": "This book completely captivated me!Oh. My. Goodness, where do I start. The plot is unlike anything I've ever read before, I loved that it was a combination medical thriller and crime novel, and the medical and DNA facts absolutely fascinated me! The characters were all so like able, well except for the villain who was thoroughly hate able! I really liked Lilly, Kadin, Nathan, and Dana. Jason and Nathan were both really cool guys but Kadin, oh my gosh! Here is a fictional man that is absolutely worthy of my fangirling, he's an amazing doctor, a man of amazing faith, a natural protector and caretaker, and just generally a one in a million man of incredible amazing ness!!! :) And in case you were wondering, yes Dr. Kadin Daughtry is on my list of favorite heroes! I was surprised by so many things in this book! I really hated to put Proof down at all, there were so many times when I couldn't begin to imagine how the author would tie all the strings together, I even found myself thinking about this book in my dreams (After I had to put it down because I was so tired that I couldn't see straight! :-) But she brought it all together beautifully, and that ending was so awesome!I will also say that I was a bit nervous about how the issue of rape would be approached, I needn't have worried! I was amazed and very impressed at just how clean the author kept the story! Needless to say I absolutely loved everything about this book! I highly recommend it, and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next two books in the series! :-DJordyn Redwood, you have a new fan in me!"}, {"userName": "Susan Snodgrass", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7103516-susan-snodgrass", "userReview": "I just found this book at Sam's Club and it sounded good, so I bought it and I sure am glad I did. The first paragraph grabs the reader and demands that they continue. By the end of chapter 2 it was ER meets Criminal Minds. This book was one big huge roller coaster ride. You're scared and want to get off but you're enjoying the ride too much to stop. Wow is not good enough to describe this book.The author is a medical professional and knows what she's talking about. I loved the chimera angle and she has done her research quite well. There are twists and turns throughout and I enjoyed every moment. I called my local Lifeway store and had them order the second in the series for me. I will have the great pleasure of reading two of this author's books without having to wait a year for the next! Then...October will see the release of the third in the series. I am one blessed reader.I love the spiritual aspect of the story also. It was wonderful without being too preachy and I'm a devout believer, too. Kudos to Jordyn Redwood. I read TONS of books and rarely have I seen a first novel this good. Outstanding book!

This is the first of the Bloodlines trilogy by Jordyn Redwood, and I'm pretty sure if you read one you will grab the others, too. I give this one a solid five thumbs up.Lilly Reeves is an emergency room physician on duty when a pregnant young woman involved in a traffic \"accident\" is wheeled through the door. The cops follow, wanting to talk to the unconscious woman because it appears a truck deliberately rammed her. The baby the woman carries is the product of an encounter with a serial rapist, and she is a key witness if they ever arrest a suspect.It's difficult to find this suspect, despite the fact that he's left semen filled with DNA behind in all his victims. Apparently the perpetrator is in the medical profession or at least somehow has access to syringes filled with a substance, ketamine, that knocks out his prey. Other clues are the location of the attacks, apparently centering on the hospital where Lilly works; that all of the victims have their keys missing for a number of hours before the attacks; and that the victims describe a man with blue and brown eyes--one of each--and a horrific monster tattooed on his chest. He has one other quirk--when his victims become pregnant, he makes sure the child does not live.Then it's Lilly's turn. Her keys come up missing, and her black belt in karate and dead-eye shooting expertise do her no good once he injects her with ketamine.Lilly accuses another physician, but it backfires when the DNA appears to prove him innocent. Suddenly, it's Lilly who is on the run."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5692732-ashley", "userReview": "Wow! This book is so intense!! Don't expect to sleep much once you pick it up bc the plot is just nonstop, it doesn't let up for a minute. Twists and turns that I never saw coming. I had no idea how everything was going to come together until the last moment. And I learned a little bit of medical trivia in the process as well. Always fun. :) The author did a great job of making me really care about the characters very quickly, pretty much all of them, I couldn't pick a favorite. I was up too late reading this one and when I wasn't reading I was still thinking about it in the back of my mind trying to figure out all the intertwining pieces. I'd say there were a couple spots that maybe could have been ironed out, places where dialogue could seem too stilted and technical for casual conversation or thoughts, but then again we're dealing with medical and law enforcement personnel and it wasn't overwhelming so it still seemed believable to me. I'm very impressed that this is the author's first book. And I'm glad it's a trilogy bc I'm hoping to see more of these characters in the future. I'll definitely be reading the rest."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2790490-katie", "userReview": "Proof was a really good book.

I LOVED the whole medical side of things. I'll admit--the medieval mysteries I've read...I usually find kinda boring--at least the 'medical' side of it.

Police detectives think she\u2019s a danger to the case, and her colleges worry her obsession will be detrimental to her health. But Lilly can\u2019t stop, even if it means digging into a dark mystery that science cannot comprehend. Alone and on the run, Lilly wonders: is there any proof that will bring a monster to justice?Acclaimed as \u201ca rollercoaster of a story,\u201d Proof debuts the twists and turns that make the Bloodline Trilogy an undeniable adventure for all fiction fans.If you ever read anything from the late Michael Crichton then you know you was famous for starting with an area that was believed to be foolproof and then showing that something went horrible wrong. That premise is exactly what Jordyn Redwood brings out in \u201cProof\u201d. We see so many police shows where they rely so heavily on DNA evidence to bring the suspect to justice. And it always works. Not so in \u201cProof\u201d. Dr. Lilly Reeves has the DNA evidence and they bring the suspect to trial and the evidence gets him off because it doesn\u2019t match. Something has gone horribly wrong and Dr. Reeves must figure out what it is before this serial rapist tries again.I think Jordyn Redwood is an extremely talented writer who really knows how to tell a story that will grab you and keep you flipping pages until you find out who did it. Not only does Dr. Reeves go down blind alleys in her efforts to prove who the rapist is she also becomes a target putting her life in deadly danger. \u201cProof\u201d is a very exciting book that will keep you engrossed in the characters as Ms. Redwood puts them through their paces.

I love a fast-paced, edgy medical / police thriller and this one was like butter icing, it was so good. PROOF had twists and turns that had me turning the pages, dying to find out how it was possible. This medical specialist author stunned me with her ability to throw me curves I did not expect.Each aspect of the heroine\u2019s life as an ER physician is perfectly detailed. You feel you are right there in the emergency room seeing the patients through the eyes of Dr. Lilly Reeves. Same with the hero, Police Detective, Nathan Long, formerly of the FBI, the detail of what a cop honestly goes through drew me in. Dr. Lilly Reeves is definitely not your typical female heroine\u2014no shrinking violet here. Lilly is a complex character, who not only is a doctor, but is an expert on guns and marksmanship, and one who struggles with past issues that make her inclined to drinking in order to bury her own heartaches. This is a realistic and totally likeable hero that will appeal to men and women.PROOF is a book that I can wholeheartedly recommend to the Christian audience and those who do not normally read Christian fiction. In fact I\u2019m taking this book to my brother today, as he too loves a hard-hitting thriller the likes of John Grisham.Jordyn Redwood is an author that I believe will soon be in the Best-Seller lists along with Randy Alcorn and Ted Dekker to name a few."}, {"userName": "Kim Justice", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6457398-kim-justice", "userReview": "What a read! Chalked full of great clean suspense, anger, mystery, up and down thriller I have had the awesome pleasure to read. This was author Jordyn Redwoods first book and she has captured me from the first to the end and has me foaming at the mouth for more. Her next book, the next in the series, Poison: A Novel (Bloodline Trilogy, #2) comes out in February 2013. And I will be per-ordering it for sure. Dr. Lilly Reeves, an ER physician was changed by horrible actions of another. She is the fifth victim. She is a character that makes you want to root for her from the beginning to the end. But when things look like that are something else other than what she knows to be the truth, well how can you not want to scream and yell! And Dr. Lilly Reeves is not going to stop till she proves the truth! How can evidence change? How can you go from being guilty to being cleared by scientific evidence? PROOF takes you all over the place and back. From like I said yelling at the book, the author, the evidence, to cheering for Dr. Lilly and praying that she can get the PROOF!!!As a new author, Jordyn Redwood is amazing! I will continue to watch for her in the future and she will be on my TBR list for each new book.

From that first trauma ER scene in the opening chapter, I was hooked. Lilly Reeves is a competent doctor, able to tackle whatever barrels through her ER doors, but she never expected to lose the strength she placed in her job, in her security, when it\u2019s all stripped away from her.The crimes are grisly ones. The victims are suffering. The villain seemingly uncatchable, even when it would seem he\u2019s in the cop\u2019s grasp.I was in awe of the intricacies that went into plotting these crimes. The novel certainly isn\u2019t for the faint of heart, but while Lilly might come across as unlikeable to some readers, I found her a hurting soul in need of healing. I couldn\u2019t imagine being traumatized as Lilly was and then not having faith on top of that? I\u2019m not sure how she made it through, but she did and none of it on her own power. When I finally made it to the happily ever after, I was so pleased to see the changes made in her \u201clife\u201d on the pages of the novel.\u201cProof\u201d is definitely what I\u2019d consider an excellent debut novel.

Mostly, this is because I too often find the pacing uneven, the protagonists less than intelligent, and the mysteries themselves more histrionic than compelling. (Granted, this is due to personal taste as much as anything.) With that said, I found Redwood's debut mystery to have neatly sidestepped all my pet peeves. She presents an extremely strong mystery that both intrigued and educated me. Her characters, their conclusions, and their reactions maintain utter believability throughout.

I have been wanting to read it for months but due to work deadlines and just overall busyness of life, hadn\u2019t had a chance to start it until last week. Was it ever worth the wait! I read it cover to cover in one week exactly, and would have read it quicker had life not gotten in the way. This book has it all. Not only was I drawn to the characters, but I was drawn to the storyline. I was totally immersed in what was happening. Ms. Redwood writes with such accuracy that you forget you\u2019re reading a book and instead feel like you\u2019re part of the drama. There were so many surprises throughout the book, I couldn\u2019t wait to turn the next page. Ms. Redwood delivers not only a story with solid characters that are relatable, but a terrific suspense novel. I honestly couldn\u2019t figure out who committed the crime, and then once it was discovered, how they were going to convict. This book has it all - romance, medical drama, police drama, and courtroom suspense. Ms. Redwood is incredibly talented to interweave all these elements together so seamlessly, in such a way that I couldn\u2019t wait to turn the next page. I read her book much like I watch a great crime or courtroom drama on TV. My pulse rate was up and I wanted to fast forward the commercials (for a book that would equal the interruptions of real life) so I could find out how the good guys were going to win. If all of the above wasn\u2019t enough to keep me reading, Ms. Redwood delivered from a spiritual perspective as well. Despite being on different levels in their spiritual journey, the main characters and secondary characters interconnected so well. Isn\u2019t that the way it is in real life? We have some friends who are equal to us in our spiritual journey, and then others who are further ahead and others who choose not to even walk the same path as us. God calls us to get along with each other and to above all, let His light shine through our lives so that those who haven\u2019t made a decision can see Him brighter in our lives than they see us. She wrote believable characters, representing each area of their growth, without having to go to extremes for me to get the mental picture. Ms. Redwood\u2019s talent again was evident in how she was able to tie the spiritual theme of Christ\u2019s salvation for our sins so subtly into the story, yet so powerfully, that when I finished reading, all I could say was \u201cWow - how did she do that?\u201d This book is a must read for people who love a suspense-driven novel with a hint of romance, all while subtly being reminded of Christ\u2019s love for us. It was written in such a real-life way that I could imagine it happening to me (which is probably why I slept with one eye open last night after reading the final chapters). I can\u2019t wait to read the next book in the series, Poison, which is coming out in 2013, which equals to \u201cnot soon enough\u201d as I would like to read it tomorrow. I\u2019m excited to discover if we get to follow the journey of some of the characters from Proof, or if we\u2019re introduced to a whole new set of friends. Either way, I can hardly wait. I am definitely a fan of Jordyn Redwood and have already started telling my friends and family about this great book. I\u2019m pretty confident that you\u2019ll join me after you read Proof for yourself!"}, {"userName": "Vera Godley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6214962-vera-godley", "userReview": "Author, Jordyn Redwood writes from the standpoint and first-hand knowledge of a long-time experienced emergency room nurse. In her first novel, Proof, she opens with a fast paced scene in the ER with Dr. Lilly Reeves handling a recent rape case. She confronts the on hand detective in the ER about the \"serial\" rapist at large. Little did Dr. Reeves know that she would be the next victim.The character of Dr. Reeves is strong as is typical of a woman doctor. She is strong in the medical profession and in her ability to diagnose and investigate medically the cases brought to her. She is not so strong emotionally because she is has a complex history which creates in her a complex individual.Dr. Lilly realizes that she know facts that will help identify the assailant and an accusation is made. DNA Tests are run but the accused is freed because the results say he is not the one. However, she knows identifying characteristics that make her realize that something is askew about the test results. The medical twists and turns of this maze will confound even the experts.She has friends in the ER with whom she works that are supportive and caring. They are also the ones who believe her - up to a point - as she tries to find proof of her assailant before he finds and eliminates her. As the story unfolds and her life seems to completely unravel, we find a soft romance beginning to bloom and it is really a treat to see this need filled in her life.This is a fast paced story that is replete with medical terminology that will sit well with those \"in the know\" an will be a strong selling point for authenticity for this the first in Jordyn Redwood's Bloodline Triology.

Is DNA evidence the end-all it is often viewed as? That's the scientific topic tackled in this medical suspense debut release by real-life medical professional Jordyn Redwood. This isn't a genre I often read, but this author came highly recommended and so I took the chance to read it when it came my way.ER physician Lilly Reeves is sure of herself and her busy life, until the night she becomes the victim of a serial rapist. The author handles this subject in a tasteful manner, and presents the emotional fall-out realistically. Each of the women claim their attacker had the same startling physical characteristics and a unique tattoo. Lilly is hanging onto her sanity by a thin thread when she is able to visually identify the man, but his DNA is not a match for any of the crime scenes. Sure that there's a way to prove his guilt, Lilly takes the investigation into her own hands and begins following a trail that will bring her unlikely allies in her quest for justice.Increasingly frustrated by the dead ends of his investigation, detective Nathan Long is eaten up with worry over the serial rapist case. Things are not adding up. When DNA evidence frees the man to whom all other clues point, Nathan is certain he is still the one behind the attacks. Things get a little more complicated when the DNA does match a man with a prior rape conviction in another state. Could he be the perpetrator? The original suspect has disappeared, and so has Dr. Reeves. There are several lives at stake, and a ticking clock, as the story races to its finish.There were several compelling aspects to this novel. There was certainly lots of medical information, but I never felt like it was overwhelming. The police investigation had an interesting angle by making the partnering detectives differ so strongly on their belief of the identity of the attacker. I thought the faith side of the story was handled well. It was the romance that had me shaking my head. There were two men who were drawn to Lilly, but only one for whom she reached out when she had a need, even at very crucial times. For their part, one of the men seemed to actively avoid being around her, so his romantic interest didn't ring true. It seemed a rather lopsided love triangle, although reader intuition told you she'd end up picking the less likely guy anyway. But in the end there were no guarantees that any of them would survive, as the deadly intent of the criminal came more and more in focus.I would recommend this book to a specific set of people. Young or sensitive readers would be encouraged to read elsewhere. For myself, I was intrigued and will definitely be reading more from this author in the future.This review originated at http://reviewsbyerin.livejournal.com"}], "description": "Dr. Lilly Reeves is a young, accomplished ER physician with her whole life ahead of her.
