This is so NOT one like that. I couldnt get to the end fast enough because I had to know what happened. I was almost late for work when I didn't want to stop reading and I am never late for work! Sara and her mother live a nightmare life with an abusive father whose abuse escalates after sara's brother Matt kills himself, although her father pretends Matt isn't dead and they have to all play along and have all the right answers or risk his rage. After Sara's mom disappears, all of her fathers targets are no longer there and she becomes his next victim. Although I didn't really want her mom to be dead, I was really hoping that that would be the only reason Sara would be left with her father. They made a plan to escape, but on that day something went wrong and her mom seemed to disappear. Was she dead or alive somewhere? If she isn't dead, how could she leave Sara with her rather knowing how is?After a while she fills her friend Zach into what is going on and there's a little Romance with a rebellious Alex who has things of his own going. She tries to protect him by letting him go but needs him. Would have made this a 4 1/2.

The thought occurred everyday within that one month. I had been thinking, was it laziness? Was it lack of mood?No.I simply didn't want to go back there again, among those trees in the cover.This is why I rarely read realistic fictions or watching documentary about abuse, poverty and such. I hate thinking, 'This shit happens, alright? More than I know. Everyday'. Oh well, I need to stop being a coward, am I?This book is told from a sixteen years old girl POV. The voice sounded like how I would imagine a sixteen years old girl feels like. Very impressive writing.While the book dealt with a heavy subject which is abuse, the romance is still incorporated but I didn't like it that much because everything between Sara and the boy who has crush on her happened too fast (It's a short book anyway and well, the romance is not the subject matter of the book a-ny-way).I'm still not sure what to make of the idea that Sara has to write an assay for every English class based on different one word each time. I mean, for sixteen years old students, that method of teaching seems...fitting only for seven years old students?Everything else about this book was mesmerizing, so I hope more people will read this someday."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12037564-jane", "userReview": "I don't know what to feel about this book. Some parts completely befuddled me. Like, your dad has been abusing your mom and yourself for so long, and if you can take it into your own hands and plan one of those dramatic escapes which don't work half the time, I'm pretty sure you can call up a lawyer five states away using a less amount of time. Sure, the dad knows all the policemen in town, but that doesn't mean the rest of the world thinks your dad is the good guy. Taping down dinner conversations and also showing the bruises is pretty good evidence after all.Now, I want to get this clear, \nI DO NOT THINK THAT THOSE WOMEN WHO GET ABUSED ARE STUPID FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING. BOLD AND UNDERLINED.\n In fact, my heart goes out to those people who were abused. You must have suffered so much. What I'm saying is that if the Mom spent such a long time planning out exactly what to pack, where to meet, when to meet etc., the thought of calling up someone, like the ultimate authorities, to help them should have crossed her mind.And then there's Alex. He seemed like such a convenient love interest, it was almost unnecessary, until the last part, that is. It's like, oh look, everyone else is making out, since I'm a straight guy, and you're a straight girl, let's make out too. To be honest, it would have made more sense if a gutsy old granny next door came along to throttle the daylights out of the dad.I get that some parts of the book were intense, but I just could not wrap my head around this fact that they simply FORGOT that they could get help. If you can order three airplane tickets, you can call up a lawyer five states away. This book is just so illogical, I can't even-Whatever. Another one of those books which I regret reading."}, {"userName": "ILoveBooks", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4177633-ilovebooks", "userReview": "Despite flashbacks to better times in Sara\u2019s family, it is impossible to feel any sympathy toward her abusive father. Beatings inflicted on her mother have gone on for years. Sara\u2019s brother chooses suicide over the emotional and physical abuse he endures. Sara herself is not physically harmed, but the strain of living with her super-critical, controlling father anymore is impossible. Her mom makes plans for the two of them to disappear, but then disappears herself. Terrified that something has happened to her mom, Sara doesn\u2019t believe her father\u2019s story of a \u201cbusiness trip\u201d. Sara works on the mystery of finding out what has happened to her mom while balancing her dad\u2019s craziness, school, a new boyfriend, and an old friend who is a good and constant reminder of her brother. Sara\u2019s sleuthing brought me into the story. It\u2019s interesting to see the steps she takes to track her mother\u2019s plans. The author does a great job of creating a squeamish, dark sense of fear whenever Sara\u2019s father is in the scene\u2026or even if she just thinks about him. I felt like holding my breath. It was almost painful to read about his temper. The dialogue between Sara and Alex lightens up this dark story. Because Sara is so isolated, reading about the loyalty and help she gets from Alex and Zach lessens the horror of her situation. The final battle shows Sara\u2019s strengths, but also highlights how much she loves her dad.Three and a half Stars"}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4803743-hannah", "userReview": "While reading the book, I really liked What She Left Behind. The mystery aspect is really well done, and I enjoyed trying to figure out what happened alongside Sara. Especially the last 50 pages or so are gripping - the suspense is so high, I couldn't put the book down. If you look at What She Left Behind as a mystery, it's a very good book. It had me terrified, like a good mystery should.Sara's dad is a total psychopath. The physical abuse he puts his family through is so strong it's scary, but what really terrified me is the mental aspect - he is completely crazy. Sara's brother Matt died a few months ago, but the dad basically pretends (or really believes?) that Matt is still alive. He talks about him as if he were still there, he gets mad when Matt isn't home for dinner or when the chore he told Sara Matt should do doesn't get done. And he expects the rest of his family to pretend, too - it's gotten routine that the father asks why Matt isn't home for dinner, and Sara tells him he's at play practice, or whatever Matt would have been doing that day if he were still alive. When someone doesn't play along, he gets even more violent. And that's just one example - Sara's dad is a delusional psychopath, and he is terrifying.But even though I liked the mystery and thought that the dad's character was very well-written, something about this book didn't sit right with me. I think it's how much it focuses on the mystery, the violence and the thrill, instead of discussing the issue of domestic abuse. I'm not saying it should have been preachy or anything like that - of course not every book needs to have a strong message to be a good book. But I think because of the focus on the mystery, the emotional aspect falls short. Books dealing with abuse are really interesting to me - it's fascinating to get into the mind of someone who's being abused, to try to understand why they don't leave the abuser or go to the police. And that part isn't really addressed in What She Left Behind - it's set after Sara and her mom decide to leave, so it makes sense we don't get as much insight into why they wouldn't leave, but I still would have liked to know some more about what made them stay all those years. What She Left Behind is really just the story of Sara trying to save herself and her mother from her father - not the story of dealing with the emotional aspect of abuse.I also didn't like the romance. It's a classic case of insta-love. Even though Sara's mom is missing, she immediately falls for Alex, the bad boy/football player, when he starts persuing her, for whatever reason. This, along with the dreaded 'I think I'm in love with you' three days after their first conversation, had me rolling my eyes at any scene that included Alex. Not to forget that this romance is developing while Sara is under duress because her mother is missing and her father is growing even more violent.The thing we discover about Matt towards the end seemed kind of random to me. I don't want to spoil anything, but I just didn't see the point of that revelation, or how that made any difference in Sara's grieving process.If you're looking for a thrill and a good mystery, I do recommend What She Left Behind. But if you go into it expecting a story about domestic abuse and what it means for the victims, like I did, you will be disappointed - the complete lack of emotion or emotional development concerning both her abusive father and Sara grieving her brother ruined that aspect for me.Reviewed at http://www.paperbacktreasures.blogspo..."}, {"userName": "Kimberly Sabatini", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1218946-kimberly-sabatini", "userReview": "If you like Elizabeth Scott, I think you'll absolutely adore Tracy Bilen. WHAT SHE LEFT BEHIND is one of those stories that is morbidly beautiful. It is the harsh reality of a less than ideal life, threaded with moments of love and hope.

What She Left Behind takes place in a family with a very abusive father, which is an important subject matter that is not dealt with often in YA literature. I was physically cringing at some of the scenes and descriptions. This is one of those books like Thirteen Reasons Why or Want to Go Private? where one doesn't want to say \"I love this book\" but something more along the lines of \"it needs to be read\". Sara's family is still trying to recover from the tragedy of when her older brother committed suicide, but her father's reluctance to believe he is truly gone, coupled with his tendency to release his emotions on her mother makes it impossible to move on from sadness and fear they feel. The day that Sara and her mother are supposed to leave for good, her mother disappears. Finding out what actually happened to her puts Sara and her friends in extreme danger. Hopefully it is worth it.When I hear horror stories such as this one, I always think (as bad as this is) \"Why would she marry him in the first place?\" It was hard for me to see that people can change drastically for the worst in response to some event. The person Sara's mother married, the person who raised Sara, is not the same one she is seeing now. I appreciated how much the author emphasized this, that he wasn't always that way. It wasn't in a way to make the reader, or Sara, feel bad for him, but almost in a way to explain. Also, I liked how the novel went into detail with not just the physical abuse, but the mental and emotional abuse as well. Sara is frequently forced to pretend like her dead brother, the brother she loved deeply, is still alive. She can't move on. In addition, her and her mother live in constant fear. There are massive retaliations for the littlest things; starting chores too late, leaving water in the shower, not washing a cup and leaving it to dry in the dishwasher. Even when Sara is not getting physically abused, she is in a constant state of unease.I only have two real complaints. Firstly, the romance in the story seems out of place and odd overall. Not just because of the subject matter, but because how they are portrayed. The school \"hot guy/bad boy\" wouldn't chance so much for the \"good girl\" in like two seconds, no one really \"links pinkies\" and they confess love for each other after just a few days (and after she treats him like crap). My only other complaint is that the book ends rather abruptly. I wish I could see a little bit of the emotional effects of what came next.However, those are no reasons to skip over this one. It really did help me understand how someone could find themselves in such a relationship, and hopefully it will help you too."}, {"userName": "Soumi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6833452-soumi", "userReview": "What She Left Behind is one of the most terrific realistic fictions that blew me up. The book is a mirror to reality that reflects the daily drama of domestic violence. Sara and her mom, wants to escape from Sara\u2019s abusive father, so they made a plan of running away. When her mom didn\u2019t show up according to the plan as expected, Sara was terrified. Her father told her, her mom left town for some business purpose Sara knew her father has something to do with her mother\u2019s disappearance. Sara was scared with the growing madness and violence in her father but she must find out what happened to her mother before it\u2019s too late for both of them.The story has a dark sense and the author was successful in creating that fear in readers\u2019 mind. What She Left behind follows Sara\u2019s fear, and her battle against her own fear. I felt completely sympathized with Sara, and the situations she dealt with, mental illness of her father, death of her brother and disappearance of her mother. What She Left Behind is entirely focused on parental abuse but I like how the author brought out such sensitive topic without any violence and I appreciate that. Still recovering from the shock of her brother Matt\u2019s death, Sara The book caught Sara on edge of terror, as well as the readers. She and her mother was forced to pretend as if Matt is alive, they lived their live in fear. Sara\u2019s father was not always like this vile, but with growing mental illness, he became controlling and over possessive that turns him into someone one eighty degree opposite to the person he used to be. The book also feature the love interest Alex, who was like an air to breathe in, Sara got help from both Alex and Zach, her best friend, and also unexpectedly there is no love triangle or insta-love, thank god! Sara was a brave girl indeed, torn between love for her father and rest of the family, she ultimately chose the right, and the climax show\u2019s her strength of overcoming her fear and move on.When her plan of escaping fall apart, she initially freaked out inside but in the end she remained clam and intact. When I started the book, I couldn\u2019t put it down; I was completely engrossed by the story facing brutal side of reality.

The cover was so creepy and the summary made it sound so intense.

One day her mother tell Sara that they are leaving and that she will pick her up during her lunch break at school. But when her mother doesn't show up, Sara starts to wonder what actually happened to her mother. Her father then begins to become abusive towards Sara as she tries to figure out what happened to her mother and why she disappeared. This is a very quick read. I just couldn't put it down. It was so easy to get into the story and feel for Sara with all the things she had to deal with. There is one element to the story that really made it more sad and that was her brother. He committed suicide a couple months ago before the story starts and Sara often has these flashbacks with him and talks about him a lot.There is also some romance in this story which I wasn't expecting. However, I really liked it. Alex was sweet and charming. There were a lot of funny scenes that take place with him in it. The last sixty pages are so intense and so scary that I was freaking out and worried about what would happen to Sara and her mom. Overall, this is a great debut for 2012.

Die fl\u00fcssige und leichte Sprache macht \u201eWie der Vater, so der Tod\u201c zusammen mit der spannenden Handlung zu einem Pageturner, den man an einem Nachmittag durchschm\u00f6kern kann, wenn einen die Lust auf jugendlichen Nervenkitzel packt.Als Jugend-Thriller darf es sich \u201eWie der Vater, so der Tod\u201c nat\u00fcrlich nicht erlauben, auf eine Liebesgeschichte zu verzichten. Zwischen Protagonistin Sara und dem attraktiven Alex entwickeln sich rasch starke Gef\u00fchle, die sie immer unzertrennlicher werden lassen. Obwohl die Liebesgeschichte ein z\u00fcgiges Tempo an den Tag legt, h\u00e4tte sie mir eigentlich gut gefallen k\u00f6nnen. Sara und Alex, die durch ihr gemeinsames Interesse an Stephen Kings Romanen zueinander finden, erleben ihre Liebe so, wie Teenager es eben tun: intensiv, impulsiv und ein wenig \u00fcberzogen. Allerdings w\u00e4re ich dem P\u00e4rchen lieber in einem \u201eContemporary\u201c-Roman begegnet als in einem Thriller, wie Bilen ihn geschrieben hat. Hier wirkte die eigentlich so sch\u00f6ne Liebesgeschichte mitsamt ihren Auswirkungen auf die Verliebten seltsam, beinahe sogar fehl am Platz. Dass Sara oftmals in Gedanken an Alex' Lippen h\u00e4ngt statt sich um ihre Mutter zu sorgen, hat leider daf\u00fcr gesorgt, dass die gesamte Beziehung einen unrealistischen Beigeschmack erhielt.Die sechzehnj\u00e4hrige Sara ist sowohl die Protagonistin als auch die Erz\u00e4hlerin des Romans. Durch ihre Gef\u00fchlsduseleien habe ich sie manchmal j\u00fcnger und naiver eingesch\u00e4tzt, aber sonst hat mir das M\u00e4dchen mit dem schweren Schicksal sehr gut gefallen. Sara ist ein ruhig, zur\u00fcckhaltend und stets darum bem\u00fcht, nicht aufzufallen und nicht den Zorn ihres Vaters zu wecken. Die vergangenen Jahre, besonders der Verlust ihres Bruder, haben sie stark gepr\u00e4gt und zu einer labilen jungen Frau heranwachsen lassen. Das Verschwinden ihrer Mutter ist jedoch ein Knackpunkt, der Sara zum K\u00e4mpfen bewegt. Sie vollzieht innerhalb k\u00fcrzester Zeit eine beeindruckende Entwicklung, die sie mir mit jeder Seite noch sympathischer gemacht hat.Die Nebencharaktere wirkten bis auf eine Ausma\u00dfe blass und farblos, aber f\u00fcr einen Einzelband mit nicht einmal 300 Seiten haben sie mir doch recht gut gefallen. Jeder von ihnen hat eine Bedeutung innerhalb der Geschichte und spielt eine tragende Rolle, die das Geschehen im entscheidenen Moment vorantreiben kann. Besonders Tracy Bilens Darstellung des psychisch kranken Vaters \u2013 dem wohl facettenreichsten und komplexesten Charakter des Romans \u2013 hat mir gefallen und mich mit ihrer Art vollkommen \u00fcberzeugt. Wenn eine einzelne Figur mit ihrem Verhalten f\u00fcr eine schaurige G\u00e4nsehaut sorgen kann, spricht dies definitiv f\u00fcr sie!Zartbesaiteten Lesern und jenen, die mit einem \u201eseichten Jugend-Thriller\u201c in das Genre einsteigen wollen, kann ich von \u201eWie der Vater, so der Tod\u201c allerdings nur abraten. Tracy Bilen nimmt kein Blatt vor den Mund, wenn sie grausame Szenen beschreibt \u2013 und von denen gibt es in diesem Buch einige, die stark auf das Gem\u00fct schlagen! Normalerweise bin ich nicht sonderlich zimperlich, was brutale Schilderungen angeht. Tracy Bilen hat jedoch mit den physischen und psychischen Schl\u00e4gen, die Sara erleiden muss, eine sehr bedr\u00fcckende Atmosph\u00e4re hervorgerufen, die sich sogar auf meine Stimmung \u00fcbertragen hat. Dass Sara alles aus ihrer eigenen Perspektive und sehr realitsisch beschreibt, verst\u00e4rkt die Wirkung zus\u00e4tzlich. Einige Male habe ich mich sogar dabei ertappt, wie ich das Buch mit zusammengekniffenen Augen gelesen habe: Aus Angst, den schockierenden Tatsachen ins Auge zu sehen!*Fazit:*Mit \u201eWie der Vater, so der Tod\u201c ist Tracy Bilen ein grausamer und brutaler Jugend-Thriller gelungen, der unter die Haut geht. Die Autorin hat ihrer Protagonistin Sara mit den schockierenden und komplexen Themen viele schwere, schier un\u00fcberwindbare Steine in den Weg gelegt. Doch Sara l\u00e4sst sich davon nicht unterkriegen: Statt sich noch st\u00e4rker zur\u00fcckzuziehen, beginnt sie zu k\u00e4mpfen. Eine spannende und aufregende Suche nach Saras Mutter beginnt, die mich mit furchtbaren Szenen und ihrer bedr\u00fcckenden Atmosph\u00e4re an die Seiten gefesselt hat. Die Liebesgeschichte \u2013 so gut sie mir auch gefallen hat! - wirkte f\u00fcr mich jedoch oftmals fehl am Platz und unrealistisch und hat mich ab und zu an Sara zweifeln lassen.

Morgen ist es so weit: Ihre Mutter wird Sara abholen und gemeinsam fliehen sie vor Saras gewaltt\u00e4tigen Vater. Sara packt ihre Reisetasche und verstaut alles wie besprochen unter ihrem Bett.Am n\u00e4chsten Tag wartet sie in der Mittagspause am vereinbarten Treffpunkt. Doch ihre Mutter taucht nicht auf.Zuhause findet sie nur ihren Vater vor, der sich \u2013 abgesehen von der geistigen Verwirrung, dass Saras verstorbener Bruder Matt nach wie vor unter ihnen lebt \u2013 v\u00f6llig normal verh\u00e4lt.Der Inhalt von Saras Reisetasche ist fein s\u00e4uberlich wieder an Ort und Stelle aufger\u00e4umt.Laut ihrem Vater befindet sich Saras Mutter auf einer Gesch\u00e4ftsreise\u2026 Doch die Zweifel werden immer st\u00e4rker\u2026 Mit jedem Tag, an dem Sara nichts von ihrer Mutter h\u00f6rt.Meinung:\u201eWie der Vater so der Tod\u201c ist f\u00fcr mich wieder einmal einer der seltener gestreuten Ausfl\u00fcge in das Thriller-Genre. Das Buch hat mich definitiv beeindruckt und es war durchweg spannend.Vom ersten Moment an sp\u00fcrte ich die bedrohliche Atmosph\u00e4re, in der Sara gemeinsam mit ihrer Mutter lebt. Stets auf der Hut, stets in Sorge, etwas nicht zur Zufriedenheit des Vaters zu machen und daf\u00fcr die Strafe zu bekommen, bereitet sie sich auf die Flucht aus diesem Leben vor. Doch so weit sollte es nicht kommen. Ihre Mutter taucht nicht auf und f\u00fcr Sara bricht eine Welt zusammen\u2026 Ist ihrer Mutter etwas zugesto\u00dfen oder bereitet sie alles f\u00fcr ihrer beider zuk\u00fcnftiges Leben vor? Sara ist nun allein. Allein mit ihrem brutalen Vater, dem sie keine Gelegenheit bieten darf, vom Plan ihrer Mutter zu erfahren.Saras Vater, ein Ex-Polizist, ist nach dem Umzug in die Kleinstadt total ver\u00e4ndert. Er ist pingelig, abwesend, flippt wegen Kleinigkeiten aus. Sara hat gelernt, sich anzupassen, ruhig zu sein. Ihr Bruder Matt war das Gegenteil von ihr. Immer auf Konfrontation aus, eckte er bei seinem Vater st\u00e4ndig an. Dies alles erf\u00e4hrt man nur in kursiv gedruckten Erinnerungen, die Sara stets vor Augen hat. Gemeinsam mit dem Bild des toten Matt. Selbstmord.So will der Leser nicht nur erfahren, was mit der Mutter passiert ist: wurde sie vom Vater get\u00f6tet? Ist sie wirklich auf Gesch\u00e4ftsreise? Bereitet sie Weiteres f\u00fcr die gemeinsame Flucht vor? Sondern ich wollte wissen, was mit Matt passiert ist, welche Gr\u00fcnde ihn dazu brachten, nur noch diesen einen Ausweg zu sehen\u2026Dem f\u00fcgte die Autorin noch einen weiteren Handlungsstrang hinzu: Die Freundschaft und aufkeimende \u201eLiebe\u201c zwischen Alex und Sara. Diese hat Frau Bilen gekonnt eingebunden, sodass sie nicht st\u00f6rend wirkt. Ebenso wie die immer wiederkehrenden Daily-Soap-Zeiten.Insgesamt lebt dieses Buch von den Gedanken der Protagonistin, die in Ich-Perspektive im Pr\u00e4sens erz\u00e4hlt. Stets schleichen sich dieselben Gedanken ein: Wo ist Mum? Ist Mum tot? Warum hat sie mich nicht abgeholt? Diese wechseln sich ab mit Saras Gedanken, dass ihr aktuelles Leben enden wird, sie niemanden der anderen wieder sehen wird, dass ihre Gef\u00fchle f\u00fcr Alex keine Chance bekommen w\u00fcrden.Die teils sehr kurzen S\u00e4tze hetzten mich beinahe durch das Buch. Werden sie in anderen B\u00fcchern als spannungsaufbauendes Mittel benutzt, werden sie hier sehr oft eingesetzt und man hat ein sehr schwer zu beschreibendes Lesegef\u00fchl: gehetzt trifft es wohl wirklich am besten. Es blieb kaum Zeit zum Luft holen\u2026 Und trotzdem konnte die Autorin diese Grundspannung immer weiter steigern, mich zeitweise \u00fcberraschen und am Ende beeindruckt und zufrieden zur\u00fccklassen.Urteil:Mit \u201eWie der Vater so der Tod\u201c hat Frau Bilen eine Geschichte erschaffen, die beeindruckt und gleichzeitig schockiert. Der besondere Aufbau macht neugierig, der gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcftige \u201edr\u00e4ngende\u201c Erz\u00e4hlstil g\u00f6nnt dem Leser keine Erholung, steigert die Spannung aber stetig. F\u00fcr dieses besondere Leseerlebnis gibt es von mir 4 B\u00fccher.Es ist ein Muss f\u00fcr Neulinge des Jugendthriller-Bereiches, die sich auf diese nerv\u00f6se Atmosph\u00e4re einlassen k\u00f6nnen. Ihr werdet nicht genug davon bekommen k\u00f6nnen!F\u00fcr Fans \u201eerwachsener\u201c Thriller k\u00f6nnte die Geschichte etwas zu unblutig sein, aber wer hier einen Blick \u00fcber den Tellerrand wagt, kann vielleicht ebenso \u00fcberrascht werden.\u00a9his-and-her-books.blogspot.de"}], "description": "\u201cDon\u2019t even think of leaving\u2026 I will find you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGuaranteed.\u201dSara and her mom have a plan to finally escape Sara\u2019s abusive father.
