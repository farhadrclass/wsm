Things only get worse for them when Bo's car breaks down and they are forced to pull into an old home to use a phone for help. They soon find that they are alone in the house waiting for the auto club, but a storm outside may delay their rescue. Soon odd things start happening in the house, things that are making the four teens realize they need to help each other and stick together to make it to the rescue from the auto club. Lisa discovers things in the house that shouldn't be scary, but are just down right terrifying when the setting is so dark and dreary. All the teens want is to go home, preferably soon and even more preferably alive. Someone seems to be in this spooky house, but they never really show themselves. Who is in the house and do they mean the teens harm? What about the little old lady that owns this house? Is she really stuck in town because of the weather or did she come home and come to some harm by the mysterious someone in her home? Is the someone in the home a hitchhiker or are they someone more mysterious than that....more other worldly?This book had me from the first word on the first page all the way to the last word on the last page. I was absolutely sucked into this book and story. This author absolutely nailed the bullseye in the writing and flow of this book! I was so into this book by the wonderful descriptions given that I found myself jumpy as I read because of how focused I was on what was going on in the book. A noise would happen in my own home as I was reading and I jumped thinking I was in the story. The characters were so realistic and fun and so well developed that I felt they were real people that I knew of. They all were so different, yet all so much alike. I loved the bonds they started to form as the book progressed. This was a bit different than most mystery books I've read, but in a great way. It wasn't this .... so and so was murdered and now we must find who done it.... it was a what is happening here and what is really going on in this house and with these teens mystery. I loved every minute of it! Nice change of pace in my reading. The ending was a bit of a disappointment to me, as it left some things unanswered, but all in all my love of the rest of the book outweighed the way things ended.If you like mysteries with a twist, this is the book for you. This is a great book for young adults and adults and is a great easy breezy read. I highly recommend this book!!!5/5 Stars!!!!"}, {"userName": "Monty Nikki", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1244440-monty-nikki", "userReview": "I was actually surprised at how much I liked this book. When I picked it up, it looked like a book a kid in 5th grade would read, but I figured, the story line sounds interesting, so why not try it out, right? I got bored after the first 20 pages, but, as my OCD kicks in, I told myself I needed to finish the book because I had already started it. So i continued reading and the mystery started and the clues began to appear and I wanted to know what, or who, was in that house, tormenting Lisa, Bo, Julian, and Teena. It would've drove me crazy if I hadn't found out. I did find it annoying how slow the clues came along and how weird it was that the teenagers didn't want to stay outside. That would have been my first reaction \"I am NOT staying in some strangers house... and the people who invited me to stay inside, it wasn't even their house!\" Really? That's just weird and it's not right. But I did like the fact that Chamberlain used magic to give his clues. That was brilliant. I also liked the fact that the author brushed on the teenager's lives and how they are connected with how their parents want a certain career for them even though that's not what they want. I thought that was a little interesting. Over all, it was a great book, a quik read, which I always like, and I definitely recommend. Warning though, there are grammar/spelling issues that come along with it, so... BEWARE. (That was the one thing that bothered me about this book, and that says something)."}, {"userName": "Leanna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/335117-leanna", "userReview": "The only reason I read A Deadly Game of Magic by Joan Lowery Nixon is because it was free. Granted, most of the books I read are free\u2014from the library. But I was actually able to take this book on an overseas flight.I read other Joan Lowery Nixon books as a teenager\u2014and I enjoyed them. Either I had no taste in books at the time or Deadly Game is just a stinker. (Since Lowery Nixon is an Edgar Award winner, I hope it\u2019s the latter.)In the book, four high school students are trapped in a rainstorm. Although the plot\u2014about a demented magician\u2014is unbelievable, the real problem with the book is the dialogue.The teenagers simply do not sound like teenagers. Teena, in particular, spouts platitudes and clich\u00e9s like a middle-aged woman: \u201cYou got guilt all over your face like jam\u201d and \u201cLooking at you is like staring at a window with the shade pulled down\u201d are my favorites. I have never heard anyone talk this way\u2014especially not a teenager.The book\u2019s romantic\u201d scenes are equally as uncomfortable. Lisa, the narrator, describes her crush, saying, \u201cI watched him leave the room, his long, slender body moving easily, and I wanted to follow him, to touch him.\u201d Is this really how teenage girls think?Deadly Game is a fast and harmless read.

Personally, I just feel bad giving the author a low rating. In my eyes, books are a such a wonderful thing and my love for them truly does blind me from sometimes seeing how bad they can be. Now don't get me wrong, I liked this book. Or at least wanted too. The thing that stood out the most to me was the grammar. When I'm reading books and notice somethings wrong I will spend hours re-reading that line until I can figure out what the author meant. I convince myself that I'm usually just going crazy. My thought process is that these books were written, proof-read, then proof-read once again by an editor. So, there's no chance that the book has any mistakes, right? Well, I just sorta ignored them and continued reading on. Hey, there's a first for everything. I was reading through reviews after I finished and numerous people stated the same thing about spelling issues. Another thing that bothered me was the \"romance.\" I noticed that most people didn't agree with this either. Four kids trapped inside a house. The whole book revolves around magic and them getting out, yet from absolutely nowhere this girl mentions that she's in love with this boy and always has been. Do you think he instantly loves her back? Of course. She does, however, mention that it might just be based on fear, which would've made an interesting plot line if she led him on and the next morning realized she felt nothing. Well, of course, it was the complete opposite of that. Just the way they talked about each other was super cringy. It reminded me of one of those super boring adult poetry books that would honestly bore the pants off of any poetry lover. I picked this up at my library because it was small and looked like a quick read. It was but I didn't really read much into the book and just sorta grabbed it. In conclusion, I'm not disappointed nor happy with this choice."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2109361-dianne", "userReview": "Joan Lowery NixonBIOJoan Lowery Nixon is the only four-time winner of the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Allan Poe Award and a two-time winner of the California Young Reader Medal.Whether it's engrossing historical dramas, chilling mysteries, suspense-filled page-turners, or adventure stories, kids, teachers, and librarians love the books of Joan Lowery Nixon.Nixon is half Californian, half Texan. She has a degree in journalism and credentials in elementary education.

Many of Nixon's books have won state children's choice awards. She is the only four-time winner of the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Juvenile Mystery. Nixon has four children and several grandchildren.Nixon describes the pleasure she gets from writing mystery and suspense: \"When I was young I discovered an evening radio program called I LOVE A MYSTERY. It was intriguing, suspenseful, and at times absolutely terrifying, and the title was correct. I did love a mystery\u2014on radio, in films, and especially in books. Maybe I'm really a detective at heart because much later in my life, when I began to write books for young people, I discovered writing mysteries was even more fun than reading them.\"A mystery begins to develop in my mind when something sparks an idea and a question grows from it. What would it be like to move into a house in which a murder had taken place? How would I feel if my best friend were arrested for murder on circumstantial evidence? As a question develops into an answer, I give a great deal of thought to my main character. She is the most important part of the story, and I see it take shape through her eyes. Before I write a word of the story I know how I'll begin it and how I'll end it, making sure to put in honest clues and distracting red herrings\u2014just to make the mystery all the more fun to solve. I love mysteries, and I want my readers to love them, too.\"In creating the acclaimed Orphan Train Adventures, Nixon explored a time and place in America's recent past that is not widely covered in history lessons. She explains, \"It was a part of history I hadn't known: that beginning in 1854, over 100,000 homeless children were rescued from the streets of New York City and sent by train to new homes in the West. As I researched early journals, I found many letters\u2014some hopeful, some sad\u2014and reports which told of tears as brothers and sisters were separated or a child was not chosen. I wanted to bring history and fiction together in an exciting, adventurous time and place, to tell the stories of those who could have traveled west on the Orphan Train.\"Many of Nixon's readers have written to her asking how to get published.

It\u2019s well-plotted and pretty intricate for one of these old school YA horror novels and I could really appreciate that.The characters weren\u2019t anything to write home about. They weren\u2019t the greatest to each other but that\u2019s more to the fact that they weren\u2019t actually friends but thrown together for a group project. They didn\u2019t really know each other beyond going to school together. I felt the characters were the weakest part of the book since none of them were all that fleshed out to really invest in. Despite their differences they were all being molded by their parents to be something their parents wanted instead of doing what they wanted so they ended up uniting under that unifying front. But that\u2019s about as deep as the characters got. Considering I did like the story itself quite a bit the lack of character depth didn\u2019t really bother me. They got me through the story and while they were annoying at times they were still heads and tales better than the students at Shadyside High.The plot itself was pretty well-constructed and breadcrumbs were dropped from the very beginning, threading the plot along so that it left no stone unturned and resolved itself pretty nicely, if not a little creepily. Actually the ending was rather depressing if you think about it for a second. SPOILER ALERT: The husband and wife magician team that these students end up coming across is the culmination of an abusive relationship where the wife was trying to get away from the husband. She didn\u2019t and paid the ultimate price. So while the students\u2019 story resolved rather cleanly and they all got out okay the side story had an incredibly dark ending that really drags it all down the more you think about it. END SPOILER ALERT.But the way the mystery is woven into the more suspenseful plot is something I really liked. Who\u2019s after them and why? It all gets answered at the end. It\u2019s well-constructed and didn\u2019t have me rolling my eyes at all. Definitely a marked improvement over some of these old school YA horror books. Not the scariest of them but the underlying subplot is creepy in a real world sort of way that digs in a little deeper, I think. The impression it leaves lasts longer. Well worth the read.4"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18213571-jen", "userReview": "I read this book in 5 to 10 minute increments over many months, with some gaps of time between readings, so that could have had an impact on my feelings towards this book. In any case, I was just not a fan. It started off strong enough, but quickly lost steam and somewhere along the line turned into a silly and boring story that involved a group of high school kids stuck in a house with a crazy person, some old time magic, a dog, high school drama, and some clues to help the kids figure out the plot of the whole thing. I never once found it scary, and was more annoyed that it was taking so long for anything to happen. It seemed that the kids just went from one room to the other with very few bad things ever actually happening. None of the kids were all that likeable either. They were just kind of a bland mixture of kids who weren\u2019t really friends, but were just stuck together for a school project, so they didn\u2019t necessarily care for each other, but they also didn\u2019t want anyone to get killed. The closer to the end it got, the sillier it got. The whole plot of them trying to \u201cout magic\u201d the crazy magician played out more like a bad children\u2019s movie than a horror book for young adults. And, it didn\u2019t get any less silly or more satisfying when it closed with the kids sharing with each other what they all learned from their harrowing experience as they waited (with the crazy magician being held captive) to be rescued."}, {"userName": "Le Petit Chat", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6035181-le-petit-chat", "userReview": "Ehhhh, four teenagers find themselves in a large and eerie house after their car breaks down in the midst of a storm.

Stine. This book is a horror mystery and keeps you wondering till the end. What makes this story particularly unique is that it centers around a magician giving insider info on typical magic tricks and illusions. The characters are highschoolers all anxious to impress their parents and live out lives that have been pre-planned for them-this is a consistent struggle between the very different but stereotypical characters; football player, closet male dancer, black female, and youngest sibling. Both books that I have read by Nixon have dealt with characters coming of age (struggling to decide on their future after high school) and have had G rated romance; one that is just blossoming and in that awkward stage. Overall I think this is a good book for a junior high school reader who is just getting into reading horror. It's not too scary, is a rather quick read and is age appropriate."}, {"userName": "Emma Decker", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16194188-emma-decker", "userReview": "After their car breaks down in a violent storm, Lisa,Teena,Bo,and Julian spend the night at an old house that belonged to a retired magician full of old props.

It wasn't quite exciting enough but worth reading."}, {"userName": "Guo Hui", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4371181-guo-hui", "userReview": "This book is the book for people who want to have a good scare. When i was reading this book, the pages just made it more intense after every single page. I liked how the kids don't realize there's a magician until 3/4 into the book, this shows that the story develops slowly. I would really recommend people who like thrillers to read this, but the story gets boring half the time, so it's like a half good half bad book. Last of all though, i think that this book requires a patient person to read it, because the action comes every 20+ pages. When it comes to the action parts however, the book helps us visualize how the scene would have been like, or how the feelings would have been feeling."}, {"userName": "Austin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4602520-austin", "userReview": "I chose this book because of the title. The deadly game of magic sounded like it would be a good book, and it was. This book involved a teenage girl who knows about and now has to use it to save her friends from a murder. Even though the begging was slow this book was really good. There was exciting parts on every page which didn\u2019t want to make me stop reading. The only thing that I didn\u2019t like about this book was that the characters that were in danger didn\u2019t seem too scared. I would have liked to see more emotion from the characters. Over all this book was good and I would recommend it to people who are looking for something with danger and excitement."}, {"userName": "Carol Yu", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4419745-carol-yu", "userReview": "i hate this book! this book probably falls into the genre of horror which isnt my type of thing. All i can say is that there is a whole group of friends trap in a house from a texas strom because there spelling bee contest was cancled.It turns out that there was a magician guy that was really creey. Unsure if he was a muderer or not but he had some how took over the home and it was a realy night mare for Lisa and her friends.This book kind of reminds me of the movie the haunted house. How there freinds were also kind of haunted by this house but together they would be able to surrive the nights."}, {"userName": "Emkoshka", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5882742-emkoshka", "userReview": "I read a lot of Joan Lowery Nixon's books when I was a child and this was one of my favourites. I vaguely remembered the plot and tracked it down to reread as an adult, even going the extra step of ordering my own copy on Book Depository, but I was disappointed. It's lost some of its magic for me, and the teenage characters are just damn annoying. I have to admit though that the last sentence is a bit of a doozy, hinting at the macabre and malevolent. Would make a good quick read over two winter's nights; maybe the tension would've been sustained better if I'd read it quicker."}, {"userName": "Rebekah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1241606-rebekah", "userReview": "I'm not into books designed to scare the way I used to be. I picked it up as a possible book for my son--who loves magic and illusions. By page 100, I knew this was not a book I was going to recommend. I had to finish if so that I knew how it ended. I liked that the author did not need to use cursing to create tension and mood--the description and foreshadowing were executed well. This is definitely a YA novel. It's not one that would interest most adults who have better problem solving skills than a set of teens in a scary house."}, {"userName": "Paige", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22460402-paige", "userReview": "Although I don't remember too much of this story know, being as I read this maybe about 8 years ago or so, I do remember that this book got me hooked on mystery thrillers for a long while afterwards. Spooky but not scare-you-into-being-paranoid spooky. Not a sappy teenaged love story like a lot of books out there for coming of age girls which I loved at the time. You finish this book feeling powerful, as if even at a young age you could handle yourself in a scary situation like that of the characters and fight your way out on top."}], "description": "Seeking shelter from a fierce Texas storm, four teens are trapped inside a strange house as unwitting players in a magician's evil games.
