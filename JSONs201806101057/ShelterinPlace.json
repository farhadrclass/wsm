Even though I had an idea of what was coming, I was still anxious and on edge. Nora Roberts sure knows how to write a gripping plot along with fantastic characters including diabolical villains. I know I've said this before but with fiction (especially thrillers) there will be times where we may need to suspend disbelief. However, I was so intrigued by the story, it wasn't really an issue for me. With its great cast of characters and a gripping and dramatic plot. \"Shelter in Place\" kept me engaged from start to finish. I definitely won\u2019t be waiting long to read another book from Nora Roberts.I'd like to thank St. Martin\u2019s Press for giving me an advance copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "Well, I can't be a smartass for this review. It was just too close to home to joke about. This story is really timely because it is about a mass shooting. It really gets in-depth with what happens with those who survived and how their lives were changed.So, the book is divided into sections.The first part is the shooting itself. How it went down, how different people reacted, what the survivors experienced. It was sad and horrible.The second part of the book goes through a lot of years telling us about several different characters and their lives after the shootings. That part was my least favorite because it really jumped around for a long period of time. But, I know it was important to bring us to the third part of the story.The third section of the book is a romance that develops between two of the characters, along with a murder-mystery of sorts. We know who did it the whole time, and we see that person's viewpoint too, it was just a matter of them being caught. This final part read more like Nora's regular romance-mystery type of stories. The female is artsy and a commitment-phobic girl. The male is a great guy who is trying to win her over.Overall, it was a great book, but there were tough moments. I think Nora did a good job imagining how living through an experience like that would affect the rest of the person's life. I hate knowing that we have all of these teens and others who are growing up with this reality. But, honestly? I don't think we have seen the last of these events. Unfortunately, we are just getting used to it."}, {"userName": "Jonetta", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta", "userReview": "In the space of a few minutes, the lives of those visiting or working at the DownEast Mall and adjacent theater in Rockpoint, Maine were permanently altered. Three shooters decided that whatever was wrong in their lives warranted the selfish actions they took in those moments. Survivors Reed Quartermaine and Simone Knox followed paths that weren\u2019t part of their original destinies until that event in the mall. Reed went into law enforcement and Simone expressed her feelings through art. I first thought this was going to be a story about a mass shooting and the immediate aftermath, more about the pursuit of the attackers and those involved in the investigation. This couldn\u2019t be further from the reality as that event just serves as the context for those that survived the massacre. Reed and Simone may be the central characters to anchor the story but there\u2019s a richness to the breadth and angles of the lives of those that surround them and others. Their relationship develops slowly and fairly organically, a quick ignition but then a slow burn. I adored CiCi Lennon, Simone\u2019s grandmother and admired Essie McVee, the police detective who plays such a strong role in Reed\u2019s life and decisions. All of this is in the midst of a really diabolical character connected to the mall shooting. This person was chilling, a true psychopath hiding in plain sight. You\u2019re just not going to breathe easily until the creep is stopped. The tension is constant but it doesn\u2019t detract from some truly lovely moments throughout the book. I loved and inhaled this book, as I knew I would, especially when I learned January LaVoy was narrating the story. She delivered her typically outstanding performance, which made this one of my more favorite reading experiences.

I don't know of many authors who could get away with what Nora accomplished in Shelter In Place without losing some fans.In her newest book, set to come out in the summer of 2018, Nora tackles a topic that has become all too common in society today - a mass shooting. When I read the synopsis, I wasn't sure what my feelings were. I had just come off of reading the ARC for Year One - a masterful new direction for Nora due out December 5th - and I was apprehensive that Shelter in Place would fall flat in it's heels, or worse, having Nora losing some fans.By page 25, Shelter in Place already met one of my criteria for a \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0frating, but I was still concerned over the subject matter. What I read was a fast-flowing, grab your attention story that flowed so well you were quickly thirteen years removed from the tragedy and into a typical Nora Roberts romantic suspense novel that reminded you it is just a story. I was impressed most with the way she blended all the characters in their own way of dealing with the tragedy and their healing. While we all pray that we are protected from such a horrific event in real life, it may just help open eyes of those who have never been touched by such an event what those who have or will experience it in the future to be more sympathetic and understanding.I will say it again. Nora Roberts is BOLD. This is the second story in a row that she has taken a new approach. The story could have had fans alienating her because of the subject matter. But I sincerely believe anyone who reads it will have a fascinating summer read, with a little bit of human awareness thrown in. It just proves that Nora continues to be a master of her craft and isn't afraid take new directions or play it safe to keep her readers entertained.A solid \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f rating from me!

I must admit I don't read her blurbs anymore. She is a MUST READ author for me and her standalone signature novels are highly anticipated and always, always immediately devoured. Shelter in Place was a touching and emotionally raw story that was as timely as it was chilling. The author delivered a tale that kept me glued to the pages, as well as utterly captivated.Nora Roberts chose a topic that gives me goose bumps every single time I hear of it in the news. Mass shootings. She took this topic and spun a story that was utterly fascinating and captivating from beginning to end. Her impeccable storytelling and incredible skill to spin an enthralling tale produced again an UNPUTDOWNABLE novel for me.Although Shelter in Place is a slow burn, the journey that both main characters took was fascinating, and appropriate for each character. Both hero and heroine were genuine and likable charters. Reed Quartermaine and Simone Knox were mature and level-headed, something Nora Roberts excels at. Both were survivors of the DownEast Mall shooting and teenagers at the time of the event. Naturally they were molted by the horrific incident and coped with it in different ways. Years later their life intersected again.As life happens,\u00a0someone was trying to finish what was interrupted so many years ago. Both, Reed and Simone, were again trying to stay alive as well as putting an end to what once almost destroyed their lives.Reed and Simone were a couple that just clicked.They made it look easy. For them, meeting each other was like finding a piece that had been missing. They connected on a level that felt right and their relationship and interactions literally felt like the calm before the storm. Reed was a darling. His dry humor, and his never-ending appreciation for his colleagues and friends warmed my heart. His genuine and reciprocal connection with Simone's grandmother was a highlight of this book. Additionally, Simone's journey was as interesting as her personality - colorful, and deeply layered. There were so many parts in this book that made me smile and happy - and than there was the suspense.I honestly couldn't put the book down. This story gave me chills. I think the reason why I was so invested in this story was because of its topic. At the end Shelter in Place was a piece of fiction, but it was based on events that unfortunately happen all over America, in schools, malls, and outdoor functions. That most of all, the realism and horror that the author masterfully\u00a0build her story on, kept me from putting it down.So, if you love reading romantic suspense, an utterly suspenseful story that had such an authentic feel that will chill you to the bone, especially the opening scene, this is a MUST READ in my opinion. It's one of her best books so far.

I admit that the blurb left me a bit hesitant.Roberts expertly creates a realistic story where the lives of two teenagers are forever changed in just eight short minutes. Shelter in Place is agonizing and harrowing with an intense view into long repercussions of violent crime, filled with a cast of characters that readers won\u2019t soon forget. The psychological and intriguing plot immediately seizes your attention from the first page to the last.Simone Knox and Reed Quartermaine are survivors. Years later, they are now adults ensconced in careers \u2013 one an artist and the other a police detective. But fate \u2013 good or bad \u2013 has a way of rearing its ugly head. And survivors of the DownEast Mall shooting are once again being targeted and killed. Reed believes their deaths are related to the mall massacre, but others disagree. When he is wounded, people begin to pay attention to what he has been saying. With time off to heal, he returns to his childhood roots where he becomes involved with Simone. And a psychopathic killer is on the loose. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m sayin\u2019 folks because spoilers aren\u2019t my thing!The romantic connection between Reed and Simone doesn\u2019t come until late in the telling \u2013 thirteen years after the mall shooting. A little disappointing maybe for some readers \u2014 me included. That seems the way Nora Roberts has chosen to roll these days. Less romance and more focus on intensifying the suspense. But in her usual inimitable way, NR has once again delivered readers another unforgettable couple \u2014 a perfect match with a first-rate relationship. I can live with that so long as the rest is engaging and interesting. That would be the case with this storyline and Reed and Simone\u2019s relationship.A small nitpick regarding the hero\u2019s somewhat obsessive infatuation with his lady love\u2019s grandmother. Not only does CiCi play matchmaker, she helps Reed with his dream house and in obtaining a new position as police chief in his hometown, too. In my opinion the infatuation was overplayed \u2013 so much so that granny was included in personal moments where grannies aren\u2019t normally found. A little strange! But NR counteracts my distress over the granny lovefest by introducing an adorable puppy that turned my frown upside down and upped my appreciation for the tale. I\u2019ll fess up that Granny CiCi plays a key role throughout the book adding goodness and wisdom and without her this story would not have been the same.Another bugger I found within this story was the significant jumps in time that weren\u2019t always easy to follow. This reader appreciates clearly marked changes \u2013 both in backward and forward movement \u2014 in a timeline. And it shouldn\u2019t be too hard of a request to manage.With her decision to seemingly break new ground and head in new directions, NR appears unaffected by what her fans may find too much of a drastic change in topics. Her romances continue ever popular and her In Death Series written as J.D. Robb is a favorite among so many readers. I stand among those! Never miss a new release. Nora Roberts remains at the top of her game \u2014 a skilled master of her craft.If you\u2019re a fan Ms. Roberts and/or romantic suspense that will terrify, move, and at times, humor mixed with the sweetness of new passion \u2014 but with less emphasis on this aspect of the genre \u2014 this captivating saga is a must read.Note: An Advanced Reader Copy (ARC) was provided by the Author and Publisher."}, {"userName": "Anita", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10765339-anita", "userReview": "Advanced Reader Copy (ARC) provided by the Author and Publisher in exchange for an fair and honest review.Suspense - Thriller - Nasty Baddie all work great. This book has a Psychopath Baddie worthy of Karen Rose. The romance, well, let's just say it's a step above the cozy variety and leave it at that. The ratio I'd give it is: Romance - 1% Suspense - 99%. This book works great on the Suspense/Thriller level, on the Romance level - not at all. But, by the time the H/h meet we readers already know these people and care deeply what happens to them. Each is a fully formed character and that is so rare in most books. Even the secondary characters are fully formed individuals. The mass shooting is just the catalyst. The real book is how the survivors deal with the aftermath and the unknown conspirator who undertakes a methodical mission to murder the survivors. Sixteen year old Simone was out to the movies in the mall with her girlfriends. She takes a bathroom break during the movie and all hell breaks loose as a gunman opens fire in the movie theater. She is the first 911 caller. Nineteen year old Reed is on a break from his waiter job. He has just made a date with a girl running a kiosk in the mall, talked to a buddy at the GameStop shop and is on his way back to the restaurant when gunmen open fire in the mall killing and wounding anyone in their path. He ends up saving a four year old boy. The mass shooting changes their lives. Simone closes in and closes out her family, who didn't really understand her before. Her outlet is her art. Powerful and gripping sculptures crafted with emotion she has trouble expressing. Reed becomes a cop and is the first to sense a pattern in the random deaths of the mall survivors.

Roberts grabs you from the first page and doesn\u2019t let go! Found myself having to keep reading, mesmerised by the narrative, and finishing the book in just over a day!Let\u2019s start with the characters. Roberts is excellent at this, putting together some very compelling protagonists that you end up really understanding. And this includes the \u2018baddies\u2019. She writes truly heinous baddies with their own biased logic and feelings. Again, in this aspect, she reminds me of Stephen King and Dean Koontz.And we come to the event that starts the whole story - a mass shooting. I\u2019m always horrified at the news of another mass shooting, which seem to plague the US. To choose such a topic I would guess will not be to everyone\u2019s liking but I personally applaud Roberts for going there, for showing the true horror of it and how one person\u2019s actions has so many repercussions - from the victims, survivors, police-nurses-doctors to the perpetrators, and not forgetting ALL their families and friends. Since Roberts is known often for her romances, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this title if you\u2019re looking only for that.

Instead of Eve Dallas, though, we\u2019ve got Reed Quartermaine, small town cop who won\u2019t let go of the case even though the FBI tells him to get lost.The story starts with three teenage boys shooting up a shopping mall/theater, leaving dozens of people dead and many more injured. Then it explores the lasting impact the event had on the survivors. Then, because she is writing suspense, we need a villain. Out of nowhere, more than a decade after the shooting, we get the highly improbable story line of a disturbed person who is stalking and killing survivors of the original shooting. Finally we get a love story involving two of the survivors, who, of course, are targets of the killer.This is not one of Roberts\u2019 greatest hits. The love story is sweet though not as fully developed as you get in the usual Roberts novel. However, Shelter in a Place is definitely a page turner. If you like the JD Robb books, you\u2019d probably enjoy this.I did find it annoying that the hero is continually joking (we hope) about ditching the heroine for her grandmother. Flirting with grandma a couple of times would be OK, but this theme got to be tedious.One more thing--I loved the descriptions of the artist at work, particularly the making of the bronze sculpture. Roberts always does a great job digging into and describing the occupations of her protagonists.

This was a very bold move of the author to include something so visceral and topical as mass shootings for the main part of her book. It was very scary to read, but the rest of the book fell flat. The characters had dumb names (CiCi, Tish, and...Tulip), the dialogue was flat, and the author was clearly using placeholders to include pop culture from the early millennium she had to research. The main character Simone was very selfish and not relatable after she survived her horrific trauma. I understand the anxiety, but I don\u2019t support drowning yourself in meaningless trysts or abandoning your family to cope. Your parents want you to go to law school, which they will pay for, but you would rather go to art school? Boo hoo, Cher Horowitz.I stopped at the 150 mark because I couldn\u2019t handle the slow pace and inanity of the main character. I also could not keep up with the rapid time jumps and there should have been time stamps on the page for guidance. I didn\u2019t agree with the senseless violence especially when the killer was immediately revealed without any suspense to the reader except when they would be inevitably be caught by the hunky love interest, Reed Quartermaine. Alright, that\u2019s a great name but it did make me guffaw when I first read it. I have less patience for her new independent novels when I\u2019ve been so spoiled by her JD Robb books. I know she can write better murder mysteries than this and I haven\u2019t been impressed with these recent books. I\u2019m happy for this opportunity to read this new release but unfortunately I did not want to finish it.

Yes, she\u2019s incredibly popular, but her work is relegated in people\u2019s minds to chick-lit and breezy, mindless beach reads. There\u2019s so much more to her work than that, especially her more recent novels. There\u2019s a depth to her prose and characterizations and descriptions that is overlooked by those who belittle her work and believe that she just writes fluff. I\u2019ve never come across another author who can make me care as deeply about her characters or make me feel their joys and sorrows more profoundly.With this novel, Nora broaches a topic that is unfortunately all too common in our modern world: mass shootings. Shelter in Place begins with such a shooting, and follows the lives of survivors as they try to put their lives back together. You can never move on from such a travesty, but you can move forward, and that\u2019s what one of our main characters does. After the DownEast Mall shooting that rips his life apart, this character decides to become a cop in hopes of helping prevent other such happenings in the future. Another character dedicates her life to art as a way to block out the past, to try to forget. When someone starts picking off survivors of the shooting, these two come together. And in the midst of this reopened wound, there is healing. And love, because this is still a romance, after all!Within the first ten percent of the book, Nora had me in tears. Her descriptions of the shooting and the victims and survivors were so realistic that I could hear the pop of bullets and the terrified screams of mall shoppers and movie goers. I felt like I was there. While I\u2019ve been heartsick every time I\u2019ve heard about a shooting in the news, no news coverage has ever sucked me into the midst of death and pain and fear like Nora did through her writing. I was in awe of her skill even as I read on in horror. But what was hardest to read was the stories of survivors trying to figure to how to go on living their lives. Thankfully, our main characters had family and friends who pulled them up and helped them rebuild.My favorite character hands down was CiCi, a free-spirited artist who is a little bit psychic. She\u2019s also a loving grandmother, and is there for the granddaughter who needs her so much. She opens her heart and home and life to so many people, and I love her for it. There\u2019s no one else quite like her, and she felt incredibly real to me.I don\u2019t want to name any other characters or go into much more detail, because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything for those who decide to pick up this book. But I will say that I absolutely love when Nora adds art into her stories, because she does such an amazing job describing both the process and the final result. In no other books can I see art so clearly as I can through Nora\u2019s writing. Whether it\u2019s a painting or a sculpture, Nora has such an amazing way of describing art where I can almost look up at my wall and expect to see the piece.If you can\u2019t tell, I have this deep and abiding love for Nora Roberts. There is no other author who I\u2019ve read more, or reread more. And I have such deep respect for her choice in recent years to start incorporating hard topics that have touched her heart into her work. If I had to choose a favorite author, it would honestly be her.For more of my reviews, as well as my own fiction and thoughts on life, check out my blog, Celestial Musings."}, {"userName": "Deb", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16065827-deb", "userReview": "Omg! I\u2019d give it 10 stars if I could! If I hadn\u2019t won this book I may have missed one of the best books I\u2019ve read in a long time! Nora Roberts, as usual, does an outstanding job bonding the reader to the characters instantaneously from page one! I felt like I was there at every moment and with every turn of the page. Tragedy and fate intertwined to bring these people together in one way or another. When the book starts off with the main event, I wondered what the heck would the rest of the book be about. Well, the main event is just the beginning of this tale! This is a very real subject matter in today\u2019s world unfortunately and a difficult one as well. I loved how she did not politicize or polarize. As in real life, there are always multiple viewpoints, belief systems, moral codes of ethics. Ms Roberts does a great job bringing these different and unique viewpoints to us without alienating any part of her fan base. From ultra conservative to ultra liberal, from Christian to Pagan, anyone can relate to someone and not be offended by the others. Seriously, if you are offended, you are you\u2019re own problem. I give this book 2 thumbs up and really hope we get a sequel!"}, {"userName": "Kris Dickinson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4038133-kris-dickinson", "userReview": "Really liked this. Nora Roberts took a mass shooting story farther. The story after the shooting and immediate aftermath, focus on a few core characters a few years and then a decade later. Survivors, families of survivors and families of victims, including the shooter's. How they coped, moved on, lived life.How the shooting molded them and who they turned out to be. And in the case of 1, on the 13th anniversary, decided that what was done that day wasnt enough and in a sick, twisted tribute to her brother ( one of the shooters), decided to finish, or try to finish, what he didnt"}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21293910-mandy", "userReview": "Wow! This book was amazing! I honestly am struggling with what to say about this one - the story had me hooked from the first page and by 10% I was crying so hard my husband thought something was wrong with me. Incredibly emotional and so well written I was able to visualize everything so well as if I was experiencing it along with the characters. The romance is non-existent for the first part of this story - the couple doesn't even meet until about 50% but when they do the chemistry and attraction are instant. Very swoony hero who falls in love at first sight and is devoted from his first glance at the heroine coming down the stairs. I loved the way Reed felt about Simone and how much he loved her. Simone was a strong heroine and I absolutely adored her. Cici was amazing as well and I wish I would've had a grandma like her. The suspense had me on the edge of my seat and there was so much devastation, my heart hurt so many times. There's not really a mystery with this one as we know the killer and their motives but the suspense lies in who is going to survive and how it will be resolved. Overall, this was an amazing story, one of Nora Roberts best - with a well deserved ending. I listened to the audio of this one and it was really well done - narration was perfect for this story.

Three teenage friends waited for the movie to start. A boy flirted with the girl selling sunglasses. Mothers and children shopped together, and the manager at the video-game store tended to customers.

And as the survivors slowly heal, find shelter, and rebuild, they will discover that another conspirator is lying in wait--and this time, there might be nowhere safe to hide.\"MY BRIEF REMARKS:I have read, I believe, EVERY SINGLE publication written by Nora Roberts and JD Robb. At times, I read a collaboration or one of the earlier days stories and think, \"nope, she's lost it or something\".... I am always SO VERY GLAD when Mrs. Roberts proves me wrong yet again! \"Shelter in Place\" us a stunning, shining example of exactly this: She still has \"it\" and blew me away with her latest novel. Friends? I FREAKING CRIED. I do NOT cry often-over ANYTHING. Seriously. I cried. I sat staring at the last words on my eReader with absolute longing for MORRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEE. I still feel a vacancy in my heart; I want MORE of CiCi (jusy for the record, I am a 12.5 weeks rookie Grandmother - I am absolutely aiming to be just a fraction of cool as her); Reed, Simone, and Barney...my new book/story soul mates and heros/heroines. Sigh. Swoon. I am so moved. I was SO riveted by this story; just so present in the content and so REAL. I am a spoiler-avoider so really, anything I comment on is basically just my emotional reaction to the item...but this book is going to be one that stays with me for a very long time; I will likely talk about it a lot and recommend it to EVERYONE - it's almost not fiction as it is such a relevant topic. I will say, I enjoyed and appreciated that the author used a relevant topic (mass shootings), but managed to completely abstain and avoid political *stuff*. I guess that's why it is fiction, eh? in closing, I feel that Nora Roberts impeccably captured real emotions, reactions, scenarios, and so on surrounding a very real, relevant topic and succeeded in weaving a tale of honor, sadness, tragedy, triumph, hate, love, crazy, and hope. I am simply stunned by thus novel and am so very glad I read it....I think most will feel the same.Thank you for reading my thoughts!

The heroine\u2019s grandmother had more chemistry with the hero than she did. I greatly enjoyed the relationship between the grandmother and hero so much more than the boring one he had with the heroine.The romance, such as it was, comprised about 15% of the surprisingly long book. The rest of it was the shooting in the past, then many, many POVs, including the killer and his victims. There wasn\u2019t really any tension in the book. Hero and heroine got together without any hurdles. We don\u2019t really see that much face time between them, relatively speaking, as most of the book is devoted to the having so many other damn POVs. Killer is revealed and everyone knows what\u2019s going on. It felt a little like an Eve Dallas book except the main characters weren\u2019t as appealing.I think so much more could have been done with the shooting\u2014exploring its aftermath on other survivors and people dealing with it, rather than the more unlikely development she came up with.

The heroine is an artist with a bent toward the fantastical. She has a free spirited grandmother who dabbles in wicca and talks about the three-fold rule. The hero is low-key, charming and affable. There is a whole section where we get a detailed description of the hero's fantastic house.But the hero is also a cop who speaks an awful lot like Eve Dallas when he is in cop mode. And the main villain is a serial killer that would be right at home with the endless pantheon of serial killers in the In Death series.Overall, I liked this book. The beginning with the mass shooting and all the different people & personalities involved was well written. I wasn't sure how I would feel reading about a mass shooting in a mall given the current climate, but I think because so much of that part of it was spent in the headspace of three of the main characters and focused mainly on their actions, reactions, thoughts and feelings, rather than a wholesale description of the shooting, there was a little bit of a remove from the violence.The first half of the book followed the hero/heroine separately as they grow from the aftermath of the shooting. They were teenagers when it happened. Reed, the hero, becomes a cop and Simone, the heroine, acts out quite a bit in small self-destructive ways until finding her center as an artist.They don't actually meet until well into the second part of the book. Hence, the suspense part of 'romantic suspense' takes way more real estate than the romance part. In fact when they do meet and get together their romance is a basic no-conflict getting together. They meet, they re attracted they become a couple. So the thrust of the book is the shooting and the antagonist that comes to the fore after the shooting.And this is where the book loses me a bit. I admit it is a bit of a personal taste thing with me. But I hate being in the villain's headspace so much. Especially one that is just evil for evil's sake. It isn't enough to make them a mass murdering serial killer, but also racist and homophobic to boot. There is no 'why' to what they do except some vague talk about bullying as a kid and just being a sociopath I guess. Honestly, I found the villain to be just too, too much and rather tedious after awhile. I especially thought it was convenient plotting to make them have bottomless resources, seemingly have an endless supply of fake Ids and credit cards to go with those ids, lots of ready cash, is an expert at computer hacking, surveillance, changing their appearance, has an 'itch at the back of their neck' instinct for danger or survival, and have a 160 IQ so they are so smart about everything. Basically this is the quintessential plot armor villain where all obstacles are miraculously cleared from their killing path until the final showdown. There is a lot of charm in the story and some great characterizations, but the villain really knocks the book down for me.I listened to this on audio and the narrator was seriously excellent. She had a nice variety of voices for all the character. She did a nicely inflected Indian accent for a smallish scene with a doctor. She does a nice New England accent, not too broad or put on sounding. She can make the older characters sound aged and the young children characters sound childlike. I even think there was one Af-Am character who code switched a little. So yeah, she gets a half star all on her own."}, {"userName": "Brie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5161446-brie", "userReview": "[ it's revealed somewhat early on that the mastermind of the thing wasn't one of the (white, male) teenage shooters, but one of their sisters, who then happens to be a psychopath and a serial killer, and that really didn't sit well with me, even if I can't quite articulate why (one of the reasons is because so many of these shootings are motivated by the hatred of women)  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1418580-wendy", "userReview": "Currently Reading"}, {"userName": "Tonstant Weader", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050909-tonstant-weader", "userReview": "America is unlucky enough to have a literary subgenre all its own\u2022, the mass shooting survivor novel. Nora Roberts turns her talented hand to the subject in her upcoming novel Shelter in Place. In addition to exploring how people were affected by the shooting, she added the complication of an unknown conspirator who seeks revenge on those who survived.The story focuses on a few of the survivors, Simone whose call to 9-1-1 saved many lives, Reed who rescued a young boy, and Essie, the cop who shot one of the killers. They, their friends, and family are transformed by the tragedy. The story follows them into the future where Reed has become a police officer, now partnering with Essie, and Simone is finding her way as an artist. The sister of one of the shooters, Patricia, has stewed in resentment for years and is now resolved to punish the survivors, in particular, those most responsible for ending the attack before hundreds were murdered.Nora Roberts knows how to write a compulsive read that won\u2019t let you go. I planned to read this in April, closer to its release date, but I made the mistake of picking it up and reading the first chapter. I was hooked. I had to finish it. Really, her books should come with a warning label\u2013don\u2019t start until you are ready to read to the end.If you like Nora Roberts, as I do, there is a lot to like in Shelter in Place. It has many of the familiar elements, romance, suspense, light humor, and good people who you can\u2019t help liking. They are the kind of people you would like to know, people who would be fun to hang out with over beer and pizza. But then there is Patricia, who is an unmitigated evil force, who planned the mall shooting, who is now killing off the survivors one by one. As a character, she is not particularly interesting, too one-dimensional to spark any real interest, but her murders are creative\u2013she has no singular method and cleverly evades discovery for a long time by making deaths seem accidental until things go awry in a big way.Nora Roberts has written over two hundred books. Her readers find familiar themes and you could say her work is formulaic, but it\u2019s a winning formula for me. The characters are sensible people. The romance is light and casual. The men respect women and the women do the same. There\u2019s a deep and abiding optimism that infuses her stories, people believe in each other, support each other, and look for the best. When they are challenged by evil, they face it with energy and wit.Shelter in Place will be released on May 29th. I received an Advance Reader\u2019s Copy from the publisher through a Shelf Awareness drawing.Shelter in Place at St. Martin\u2019s PressNora Roberts author site\u2022 There are few non-American mass shooting novels.

It took years for Simone to settle and find herself after tragedy and now she's happy living on Tranquility Island with her beloved grandmother CiCi. But it's not until Simone meets Reed Quartermaine, another survivor of DownEast who has moved to the island as the new Chief of Police, that she truly finds peace.I was quickly sucked into Shelter in Place and it had everything I love from Nora Roberts. This one falls into her saga type books where the reader goes through years with the characters as they grow and change. In fact, Simone and Reed don't even meet each other until almost 50% of the way in but I never felt bothered by that. It was fascinating to see how both were affected by the shooting and how it shaped their lives along with others who were at the mall. I actually would have loved even more tidbits into their lives before we got to the present day. There were several characters that we follow in the book and each one really helped build the main story surrounding Simone and Knox. Easily one of the best characters was CiCi who would just light up the page every time.Reed was your typical Nora Roberts hero, he's charming, smart, dedicated, and completely in love with the heroine from the first time he sees her. As a long time fan of Roberts' heroes, I enjoyed every second and practically lost my heart with the addition of an adorable dog, Barney. Reed was the perfect match for Simone as he helped her come out of her shell, find relief from her guilt, and accept her for exactly who she was. Simone has always moved to the beat of her own drum and that's made things tough with her more traditional family but CiCi has always been her solace and encouraged her love of art. Of all the DownEast survivors, Simone has probably struggled the most with moving on so we see a lot of her grappling with the past.I can't lie, reading this one was a bit tough considering all the shootings featured in the news. But I felt like of any author, Roberts can and did pull off writing about this topic. Her more recent books have all been heavier and darker in content but her writing is as strong as ever. I was absolutely creeped out -- in the best way possible -- by the killer in this book. If there's one thing Nora Roberts has always done well it's writing a truly villainous character. I would highly recommend this book to any fan of Roberts' newer books or anyone who loves suspense romance. It's a long read at over 400 pages but well worth the time!4 out of 5 starsFind this and more on my blog:Happily Ever After Book Nerd"}], "description": "From #1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts comes Shelter in Place\u2014a powerful tale of heart, heroism . . . and propulsive suspense.It was a typical evening at a mall outside Portland, Maine.
