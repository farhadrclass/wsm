Meisenheimer's amazing knowledge and vast vocabulary astonish even the most sophisticated of zombie scholars. What is also truly extraordinary about this book are the dozens upon dozens of QR codes which are implemented on every single page of this innovative release. Upon scanning the QR codes with your smartphone, you are led to an astonishing webisode of The Zombie Cause which demonstrates the zombology term in dramatic and often graphic ways. Speaking of graphic...this book has astonishing photography of actual zombies and zombie hunters! For the literary astute, you will also discover a libertarian political undertone which will intrigue and delight the most intrepid of zombie hunters. 5 stars for this multimedia extravaganza by the world's authority of zombology."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18159856-david", "userReview": "Doc Lucky Meisenheimer gives Max Brooks a run for his money in The Zombie Cause Dictionary. I have never read anything more hysterical or fascinating in my entire life, and my zombie-obsessed sons would agree. I first learned about Doc Lucky Meisenheimer with his sci fi thriller, The Immune, which had reaped a ton of awards this past year. I was surprised when picking up The Zombie Cause Dictionary, as it is an entirely different genre, yet still politically thought provoking. If The Immune is Meisenheimer's 1984, then The Zombie Cause Dictionary would be his Animal Farm. Also, if anything, you have to check out this book not just for the zombology terminology but to scan the QR codes which lead to Zombie Cause videos staring Doc and his three zombie hunting sons.Buy this book. You won't regret it!"}, {"userName": "Anastasia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18160042-anastasia", "userReview": "Calling all zombie hunters and huntresses! This is a MUST READ! I am a zombie freak and have been preparing for the apocalypse for years. Yet never before have I come across anything like this. Doc Lucky Meisenheimer is a genius of zombology and a master of zombie hunting (just check out his saw blade yo-yo). 3 generations of zombie hunters are highlighted in this dictionary (which also serves as a fabulous introduction to The Zombie Cause webisode series) and their insight, advice, and humorous stories of living in the Zomberosa and hunting zombies with gusto. And get this...the book has a ton of QR codes which lead to Zombie Cause videos which demonstrate the zombology terms Doc Ruger describes. Also, the photos in the book are ASTOUNDING. Check this out...it totally tops The Zombie Survival Guide!"}, {"userName": "Bob", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18160321-bob", "userReview": "I first discovered Doc Lucky Meisenheimer in Reason Magazine, which compelled me to read his award-winning, science fiction debut, The Immune. The Immune is an allegorical tale of political intrigue. Thus, I was shocked when picking up The Zombie Dictionary, as it is an entirely different style. However, once again, Meisenheimer has revolutionized the genre. He has created a multimedia escapade with pictures and videos to convey zombology terminology. He explores this history, biology, and even the physiology of zombies...all with a libertarian undertone which I found to be both inspiring and amusing. Three cheers for Doc! I look forward to his future work. Who knows what his brilliant and endlessly fascinating mind will come up with next..."}, {"userName": "Tori Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18158947-tori-andrew", "userReview": "Without a doubt, Doc Lucky Meisenheimer (also known as Doc Ruger) as the authority of zombology! In The Zombie Cause Dictionary, he expounds upon the history, biology, and physiology of zombies. It is definitely the most entertaining yet informative read I have ever encountered. Furthermore, it's a multimedia extravaganza! The book has over 75 QR codes which (when scanned with a smart phone) all lead to entertaining Zombie Cause webisodes which demonstrate the zombology terminology described in the book as well as capture Doc Ruger and his three zombie hunting sons in action! I absolutely love this book and recommend it to anyone who is preparing for the zombie apocalypse."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18159752-melissa", "userReview": "I must admit that zombie books are not usually my cup of tea, but am AMAZED by the crazy, realistic photos of zombies in this book. The photography in this awesome -- totally enthralling. The definitions within the dictionary part of this book are hysterical...this is fun to read, and I feel like a kid again. :) Doc Lucky conveys zombology in a satirical light -- and with terrific originality. The QR codes on each page are pure genius & we'll see more of them in other books, I'm sure. I haven't scanned all of them, but I love every webisode I have watched so far of The Zombie Cause. Doc Lucky and his sons are one-of-a-kind. This is a fun book, with some seriously impressive zombie photos."}, {"userName": "Sigmarie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18159659-sigmarie", "userReview": "If you are fascinated by zombies, you'll enjoy Doc Lucky's Zombie Cause Dictionary--it's everything you ever wanted to know from the process of zombification to zombie hunting techniques. The basis of the dictionary is interesting with three generations of zombie hunters sharing advice and wisdom for surviving a zombie attack.
