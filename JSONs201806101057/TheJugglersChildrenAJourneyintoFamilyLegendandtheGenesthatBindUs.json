Many nights I'd be up until 2 am, despite having to get up for work in only 5 hours, because I'd be \"on a roll\". I'd be uncovering a stream of information about newly discovered ancestors, going farther and farther back. One line even got traced back to the tenth century. The key was hitting European nobility in your lines - once you found that, you were in through the door to a rich world of intricate genealogy that was often well documented.  \"Brick walls\", in which no further progress could be made on a particular line, became more and more common as I exhausted the on-line sources. It was the lure of the 'Eureka!' moment that propelled me. Carolyn Abraham in this book compares this to the addicting playing of slot machines. Every once in a while you are rewarded with celebratory bells and whistles and a few coins, and this encourages you to keep playing. Nothing beat the immense satisfaction of solving a mystery. In one instance, I was able to 'find' a long-lost relative who disappeared in the 1830s, never to be seen again by his family in England. The scoundrel had absconded to Canada and set up house with a new wife and family, but the link was never found until the 21st century. The descendants of his English family were gobsmacked when we made contact. They always wondered what happened to him. Sweet.So I really get this story. Tracing the genealogy of her own family with roots in China, Jamaica, India, England...it seems to be not possible. But Abraham is a journalist with a good science background and the requisite degree of obsessiveness. It takes many many hours of patient searching through online archives, databases, old newspapers, genealogy trees to find just snippets of relevant information. Then she started to also use the information gleaned from genetic analysis of buccal swabs of family members. Genetic genealogy has become big business in the last few years. DNA analysis sometimes helps to break down the brick walls. This was a fascinating description of how she was able to use this technology, and its pitfalls and limitations. But she keeps the emphasis on solving the mysteries of her family tree, and muses about the ethics of genetic digging (many people think some things are best left undisturbed; 'false paternity', is said to be about 10% -- your dad may not be your dad). A fascinating and unusual account of what it means to be a family."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "I felt a gust of breath and then a soft, firm tap on my crown and the damp spray of a snort. Anyone can receive the blessing of the temple pachyderm for a few rupees, which the elephants are trained to collect with their trunks. It's nearly as common as incense in south India. But at the end of that long day, near the end of a journey I once said I'd never make, in search of some connection to an ancestry I'd never known, it meant something to take part in that ancient Hindu ritual. It may have been a sacred rite to some long-forgotten ancestors, before we, like so much of the world, split from our tribes and our gods. The symbolism of the act was powerful to me all the same, maybe even spiritual on some undefinable level \u2013 to feel small and vulnerable beside this big, timeless rock, on my knees before a beast that could crush me with a sneeze \u2013 the six-tonne pet of the Kurumbas; the workhorse of the British; an icon of wisdom, memory, India, and, of course, the circus.\nHere's the thing about being Canadian: We so embrace the idea of being a multicultural country, celebrating the great mosaic of nationalities that have found their homes here, that in addition to the frequent public festivals that honour this or that heritage, school kids are routinely told to write a report on interesting cultural traditions they celebrate at home, or to bring an exotic dish to school to share with the class. Having lived in Canada for many generations, mine and my husband's backgrounds combined to make a couple of Heinz 57 kids, and with one grandfather who is half Italian, my two little redheads often clung to this as the most exotic fruit on their family tree, toddling off with a pot of inauthentic spaghetti or ersatz antipasto. Having come to Canada from England in the 70s, author Carolyn Abraham encountered the same atmosphere, and when she asked her mother, \u201cWhat are we anyway?\u201d, her mother would reply, \u201cJust say we're British. I'll make Yorkshire Pudding for your class.\u201d Somehow, little Carolyn knew that their history was more complex than that, and when she grew up to become an investigative science journalist, she eventually endeavored to learn the truth. The Juggler's Children is the extraordinary tale of Abraham's search for her family history \u2013 through written records, emerging DNA technology, and networking with other amateur genealogists \u2013 and with clearly explained science, several trips to exotic locales, and an engaging storytelling style, Abraham unravels an intriguing, personal family tale that becomes universal to all of us. Granted, most of us wouldn't have as provocative a jumping off point as Abraham: She was born in England, to Anglo-Indian parents who had emigrated from India not long before her birth. Neither of her parents had much information about their family trees \u2013 there might be some Portuguese in there somewhere \u2013 but each harboured a mystery. One of Abraham's great-grandfathers (on her mother's side) was a celebrated Jamaican Sea Captain who died young of beriberi, and another great-grandfather (on her father's side) was rumoured to have been a Chinese juggler (transplanted to India's hill country) who abandoned his young children when his wife died. As this was at the dawn of consumer genetic testing, Abraham started by taking cheek swabs of her relatives and uploading the results to internet databases. As matches with other users began to trickle in, what Abraham discovered would prompt correspondence with potentially new relatives and lead her and her family on trips around the world.I had heard before of Mitochondrial Eve (the one ancestral woman who passed her mitochondrial material down to all of us through the matrilineal line), but I had never before heard of \u201cGenetic Adam\u201d:\nThought to have lived about 59,000 years ago, this Adam (unlike the Biblical Adam) is not cast as the first man on Earth but rather as the one man whose male descendants survived to populate the rest of the planet.\nBecause of the nature of the Y chromosome, males can easily have their direct patrilineal line traced back to origin groups, with the interesting caveat that even thousands of years ago, groups were mixing and interbreeding and there's no such thing as a \u201cpure\u201d race anywhere on earth. Abraham was able to swab direct male descendants of each of her missing great-grandfathers (an uncle and a brother), but was frustrated when she didn't get many matches with other users (and especially in the Chinese line as the technology isn't popular among the Chinese today). She was also discouraged by the lack of official information to be found about her female ancestors:\nWomen are relatively absent in historical paper trails. Women too rarely wrote wills or paid taxes, joined the military or owned property. More often they themselves were property.\nOne thing Abraham learned from her research was that roughly ten percent of users will discover that their fathers aren't their biological parent. Oops. Another thing she had to get her mind around: If your research leads you to a Jamaican sugar cane plantation, are you prepared to learn that your ancestor was a slave? Or a slave owner? Slightly off-topic because it is, coincidentally, in the news today: Due to a regulatory loophole, American companies are able to market health-risk genetic tests here in Canada, and loads of people are sending off to find out if they are predisposed to certain cancers or whatever. Just today, Parliament is discussing a bill that will prevent Life Insurance companies from discriminating against a person's results from these tests (not health insurance; this is still Canada), but the idea that you might be denied life insurance because of a known pre-existing condition might give a person pause before sending off the cheek swab (besides the potentially devastating results that the layman might have trouble interpreting; there's a reason other countries don't allow these tests for the home consumer).Abraham has a knack for explaining the science without making this feel like a science book (and to anyone who might say that the science has evolved enough in the past few years to make this obsolete, it's still a valuable record of its own time), and also for making me care about her own personal history (until some things got a bit repetitive). Ultimately, anyone who shakes their family tree might find a few surprises tumbling out, but go back far enough, and we're all related anyway. I enjoyed this read very much."}, {"userName": "Candice Abraham", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5107130-candice-abraham", "userReview": "What can I say...this is one amazing read. Who knew you could get locked into the suspense of a story and actually learn some science along the way! Seriously though, I could not put this book down and devoured it over just a few days. The journey Carolyn Abraham takes us on is fascinating and coupled with Abraham's superb storytelling ability, I found myself just turning page after page until I was done.I didn't realize how much genetic knowledge we actually have now, especially as it relates to ethnicity. And I was surprised to learn exactly what kind of secrets genetic testing can actually dig up.What I also appreciated about this book is how, through Abraham's journey, the world seems a little smaller and we're able to see more clearly the different levels we're all connected on. I also truly appreciated the way this book taught me about the histories of certain countries and the people that make them up.But more than anything, it is Carolyn Abraham's story that drew me in, as well as her writing and her ability to drop information into the book and then come back around to refer to it again with humour and wit.If on any level, you've ever asked yourself, who am I? Where do I really come from?

This is such a terrific story, filled with mystery and secrets about ancestry, a search for identity and an era in India's history with Britain purposefully ignored and almost suppressed. It is also the story of DNA, the science of which tells about forbears almost as part of fairytales and the strands which can uncover answers to questions so many of us have in a world where our ancestors left little record for us to know ourselves. The science gets a bit complex, but just skim along if that isn't your brain's fort\u00e9 - and it is just a small part of the book. Carolyn Abraham is a journalist, and she has written a true story that reads like a fascinating novel. Canada, though now a multi-cultural nation, was settled by Colonial powers and the British biases left a strong imprint on the country until more modern times. Skin colour and eye shape differences from the ruling class were noticed, because immigration had been very limited to those of Asian background and native aboriginals were treated as a class unto themselves. Carolyn Abraham's journey of discovery was triggered because the kids at her school wanted to know why her skin was darker than theirs. That question led to this incredible research and resolution. Highly recommended for those who like Anglo/Indian history, family history stories, tracing ancestry, the miracle of the history in our DNA."}, {"userName": "Dar", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10640307-dar", "userReview": "A very detailed account of the author using DNA testing to uncover family tree mysteries.

It has certainly got the genealogist in me stirred up, wanting to get researching once again. The book gets its name from the author\u2019s pursuit of information on her paternal great-grandfather, apparently a Chinese juggler. Although this one man gets her started, she also ends up pursuing family ties in India, England and Jamaica as well. Once research gets rolling, it can literally lead you anywhere\u2014how much more exciting does research get?The author, Carolyn Abraham, is a science writer who details her experience into personal genetic research combined with old fashioned interviewing of family and potential family as well as searching the paper and ink records. One of my friends asked me years ago to participate in National Geographic\u2019s genetic project, but for some reason I was not at all interested at the time. I may have to re-visit that decision in light of this book. After all, we have some rumours of North American Indian blood in the family and there is one man in our Danish line of ancestry whose name whispers \u201cRussian\u201d to me. Perhaps we do have mysteries that we can tango with through DNA.I was particularly struck by one passage in the book:\u201cI asked Adrian why he thought so many people\u2014people who might never have spent a minute researching their ancestry\u2014felt suddenly compelled to find genetic relatives. \u2018We\u2019re lonely,\u2019 he said flatly. \u2018Families are so fractured, and we\u2019re all caught up in this rat race and in the process we kind of lost our identities. I\u2019d much rather talk to a cousin I never knew I had than to a complete stranger. We don\u2019t want to be so lonely anymore.\u2019\u201d Shades of Kurt Vonnegut and his book Slapstick, where everyone is to be assigned a middle name: a random natural object and a random number. Anyone who shares your object is a cousin and anyone who shares the object and number is a sibling. Thus community is created. Lonesome no more!I have spent time tracking down distant cousins. I have cold-called complete strangers with the \u201cright\u201d surname in ancestral areas. I remember having tea and muffins in Moncton with a very lonely elderly woman, who gratefully shared all the family information that she knew in exchange for an afternoon visit. I\u2019ve prowled cemeteries in New Brunswick with various shirt-tail relatives, looking for the gravestone of a missing great-grandfather (we found it because a distant cousin was dating the grounds keeper of the cemetery and he consulted the plot plan for us). En route to another cemetery, I was assured by a many-times-distant cousin that \u201cthe land owner knows my car and so he won\u2019t shoot.\u201d I\u2019ve been given privileged access in an archive on the say-so of a distant cousin. The bond forms quickly.Genealogy is addictive\u2014it is mysterious, as you use family legends as a starting point to discover the paper trail. You are always open to hearing another family story and following up any clues you may divine from it. You plan your vacations around visits to archives, libraries and burial grounds. Facts are assembled, compared, analyzed, all in an attempt to figure out where to look next. And the stories are fascinating. The people, by and large, are warm and welcoming. We really do like to talk to \u201ccousins we never knew we had.\u201d It\u2019s fun to share stories and figure where the intersections are and if we are very similar or quite different and yet still Family.The other things that strikes me about this genetic research is the extent to which we all share genetic material. No one is \u201cpure\u201d anything. It truly proves that racism is just chasing your own tail\u2014completely pointless. I read in one genealogy text that if you go back 30 generations, we should each have millions of ancestors. But there weren\u2019t that many people in all of Europe back then, so if you have European ancestors, you are not only related to royalty, but you are also connected to every swineherd.The genetic tests are not miracles\u2014they may just open certain research avenues and discourage us from others. But I think I may have to venture into this new game and see where my DNA takes me."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3669850-helen", "userReview": "The Juggler's Children is about the Canadian author's \"dance between DNA and documentary evidence, science and paper\" as she sets out to uncover the mysterious origins of two of her great-grandfathers, one of whom she inherited her surname from (\"the juggler\"). At the beginning of the book there are two family tree charts, one for the descendants of each of these great-grandfathers who married and fathered children in India but originally came from somewhere else (China and Jamaica, probably). In hindsight I should have drawn another family tree chart for the Crooks family in Jamaica as I read what her research uncovered there, as it was not so easy keeping up with the Crookses, but I was in too much of a hurry to find out what happened next. I guess it could not have been included in the book without giving too much of the story away.Even though my 100% European ancestry is not nearly as interesting as the author's, I can identify with so much of what she wrote having similar family mysteries of my own to solve. Regardless, I am a sucker for a good detective story. I also learnt some history, geography and science in the process.The book would also be a good primer for a \"genetic virgin\". It discusses genetic genealogy in layman's terms and illustrates the various pitfalls of genetic testing and analysis via the author's personal story. Her experiences demonstrate the limitations of both science and paper, and hence the value of using both to corroborate each other. Abraham is a science writer and weaved various milestones in genetics and genetic genealogy into her story. However, science has already progressed somewhat since the Abraham family undertook genetic testing. There is now greater emphasis on testing autosomal DNA inherited from both parents and the costs have dropped substantially. Pioneers of genetic genealogy are impatient, and this book gives us some perspective in that regard.The writing style is well balanced, not too dry given the scientific subject and not overly verbose. The book contains plenty of humour, puns, metaphors and phrases that made me smile such as \"typos\" regarding mutations, \"kiss and tell\" regarding the Y chromosome and \"old boys' club\" regarding Y haplogroups (not having my own Y, I can really identify with that one)."}, {"userName": "Kae Emm", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6782188-kae-emm", "userReview": "A really interesting read about one woman's pursuit to find out more about her family history, using genetics as the main investigative tool.

She tracks her mother, who has Indian, black and English blood, five generations back -- to a slave trader living in Jamaica. The author is a professional writer, and it shows. Her writing is crisp, focused, detailed and engaging. She tells her story, all she did to trace her roots, and her discoveries -- including blind alleys and wrong turns and false-positives, and successes and failures. You feel like you are going on the journey with her.Various technical DNA terms are explained in simple and clear language, and how paper trail connections are made (and not made) are quite fascinating.

There were some remarkable coincidences along the way too. I'm not sure this book would be of interest to people not interested in genealogy.

Several patrons in our library were checking it out enthusiastically and one of our volunteers spoke of how much she was enjoying it and encouraged me to read it - it was like a popsicle that you know WILL come but when will it actually be yours. That preamble meant that I was ready to really like the book but not necessarily love it. Well, it turns out that I did.Carolyn Abraham does what all great storytellers do by letting us fall in love with her characters (her parents, near relatives and not so near relatives) and then walking through the journey. Her research into maternal and paternal lines took her 7 years and in that time she was fortunate to have a young daughter and then a son. It was a great mix of what it was like to research and have successes and failures but still include tidbits about her children and pregnancy. I really like a book that is a blend of story and science but I like it even more when it is a busy woman who is struggling with the small things in life like missing a child when she is on a trip and balancing her reactions to family infidelities. The path she takes through churches and hill-top villages, many continents and so very many e-mail messages sent out with the hope that someone will bring an answer wasn't ever too confusing or depressing. She and her family met some wonderful people on their journey but she included descriptions of the risks they were taking and the hard truths they uncovered. Much of this book goes into detail about history you might have learned in high school but it brings it down to the human level so it seems so much more real and pushes you to wonder if you should have paid a little more attention to that teacher - because William Cromwell or Genghis Khan are very interesting in this book - perhaps your teacher was telling you great stuff and you missed it by doodling in your 3-ring binder.Since I began reading the book I have had great conversations with people about ancestors and family resemblances. I'm not sure I would have ever gone to the same lengths Carolyn Abraham did but her story makes it seem like it was all worth it. She ends her book with a little window into the world she has made for her young daughter and it ties it all together so nicely - she searched for information and truth to being a bit more clarity to the way she views her own family history - and she is able to pass that on to her own kids. I'm sure that the multiple great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents she tracked down would be thrilled that she did.

There were also stories of a great-grandfather known as \"The Captain\" who sailed to India from Jamaica, and it wasn't clear whether he was from a white plantation-owning family or a black slave background. Combining archival searches in India, Jamaica, and Canada with commercial DNA tests and old-fashioned family stories, Abraham tries to piece together her origins.The focus of the book is the ability of DNA tests to reveal ancestry. Abraham and her relatives were found to have traces of South Asian, East Asian, West African, and European genes. She explains how certain DNA is passed down only from mothers and how the Y chromosome in men must come directly from their fathers. By comparing samples to those from people around the world, scientists can estimate where your DNA originated and how long it's been since your forebears left their ancestral homeland.Told in a solid, journalistic style, The Juggler's Children recounts Abraham's years-long investigation, including some of the false leads. It did at times get confusing because of all the relatives and contacts referred to mostly by their first names. She may have had the growing family tree straight in her head and in her notes, but we readers can get a bit overwhelmed by the large cast of ancestors.Abraham discovers a range of potential distant cousins, including black men with European male ancestors and white relatives with African and Asian DNA. In the long run, DNA can only tell you so much and cannot replace the oral history that every family has. But it at least helps you determine what questions you should be asking."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5900460-jenny", "userReview": "Abandoned.

The premise looked promising, but I believe it failed to deliver.From the level of the science discussed, I assumed the author had a deep science background, but the accompanying notes indicated the author doesn't have a science background, that the information came from others providing their advise and expertise.It has been a long time since I heard buzz about genealogy and DNA. The book made it sound like a huge and growing business field. But I live in Canada, and it's been at least a decade since I last heard the buzz around this field.The author makes a comment in the accompanying notes that she was competing with the bible in terms of the length of the book, and that she tried to shorten it as much as possible. I felt it could have been shortened by at least a hundred pages. There was a lot of useless information presented and duplicate information. I read the same explanation a few times throughout the book. Some of the sections of the book felt like they had commercial breaks between them, where the author previously explains something, then a few pages later recaps the previous explanation incase the reader had just forgotten the previous explanation.Well before half way through the book, you start disliking the main character and her compulsion to impose on her family her desire to track their family history. At that point you have no attachment to any of the characters, and you begin to count down the pages until you can forget about the book.What I liked about the book is how the author identifies and tries to address Genealogical DNA testing, how it can not only bring families together, but can also divide them when results identify illegitimate children (or other general skeletons in the family trunk)."}, {"userName": "Gordon", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11095410-gordon", "userReview": "More like 4.5. This book is a fascinating look into the emerging science of DNA especially as it relates to genealogy. Abraham delves into her family's past as she searches for two legendary ancestors - a juggler from China and a Captain from Jamaica. She finds a past as diverse as sub Saharan Africa, Jamaica, China, south India and Scotland with several other steps between. This story makes a mockery of any notion of \"race\" and racism. We humans are an interconnected matrix of genetics, not a series of defined races.The book is an entertaining guide to haplogroups, haplotyes, genetic sequences and many more terms most of us are not familiar with. It uses the the story of the Abraham family that has some great characters to keep this from becoming a textbook. It also gives starting points if you are inclined to search for your family. A quick look on the internet shows a massive group of fans of this search activity.A couple of minor points. The Commodore 64 computer did not have a monochrome screen. We used our 64 monitor as a second TV, attached to a VCR for years after the computer died. Abraham states that all people groups left Africa as black people before color divergence occurred. This may be true, but we have no proof of this anymore than we can prove that dinosaurs had brown-green reptilian skin. It could be that people with lighter skin tones left because of climactic reasons, but then we don't know what the climate was like during the various time periods. Someday in the future DNA may well be able to provide a reasonable image of what a person looked like, until then we can't assume anything aside from regionalized basics.A significant book well worth reading if you are interested in genealogy or genetic science."}, {"userName": "Carolyn James", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5717311-carolyn-james", "userReview": "Growing up, Carolyn Abraham would feel dread every time she was asked \"where are you from?\" She was darker skinned then Caucasian, her last name was Jewish and she once met a grandfather with disticntly Chinese features. With all these ethnic possibilities swirling around, Abraham turned to DNA testing to find out where she is truly from. Though my upbringing is very different then Abraham's I can see where the desire to know your roots could gnaw at you. I come from a family where I see 3rd generation cousins on a fairly regular basis but I know nothing past our family living in Canada. I don't know exactly where our ancestors are from and it would definitely be cool to find out more. That being said, this book turned me off ever considering the DNA testing route. There seems like there is so many variables to finding actually perfect markers with distant relatives. What looked perfect at 12 markers in Abraham's testing diminished when expanded to 37. What can being part of a haplogroup with thousands of other people really tell you? It just seemed like she was working with a database that isn't at the level of accuracy it needs to be at to make solid conclusions and I started to get bored with all the big matches that turned out to be nothing. It's an interesting book for the biology and history perspectives, but it drags on too long and the appeal starts to fizzle. 3 stars."}, {"userName": "LibraryCin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12860715-librarycin", "userReview": "3.5 starsCarolyn Abraham was born in England, but grew up in Canada. She had brown skin and when she asked her parents where they were \u201cfrom\u201d, they had a hard time answering. As she traced back their lineage, she followed them to India, her father's roots to China, her mother's roots to Jamaica... She did this with a combination of \u201cpaper\u201d research and DNA testing of many family members. This was quite interesting. I will admit to falling in and out of focus at various points (and not consistent points), but overall I found it interesting. I was able to follow some of the science/DNA stuff, but lost interest at other parts. Likewise, my interest waxed and waned at various points while she was actually learning stories of her ancestors. I think I found the Jamaica section of her mother's family the most interesting. It almost makes me want to research my own family... but not quite!

Thanks Julia for the recommendation. What a journey Carolyn Abraham took to search for ancestors on both sides of her fascinating family. Her telling of the search was both deeply personal, as she discussed the probable lives of her recent ancestors and what it told her about her more distant relations, as well as being beautifully described from the scientific side with tales told of chromosomes, nucleotides and alleles. I learned much about the messages to be found (and sometimes unfound) in the Y chromosome & mitochondrial DNA. Yet her teachings were clear and often told with a lively sense of humour. My only regret is that I wish I had looked back more regularly on the 4 generation family trees of her mother and father depicted at the front of the book as she discussed various lives.

If you had told me yesterday that I would read a book about DNA testing and family roots practically in one sitting I would have told you no way. Fascinating, moving, incomprehensible... Yea, there were a few paragraphs I skimmed, mostly the ones that gave the scientific background and justification - I got the gist. This book reads like a mystery novel (which I happen to really like) and confirms the old adage that truth is stranger than fiction.I remember discussing with friends one of the articles she quotes regarding an unexpected issue with genetic testing being that 10% of the time the father is not the father (you read that right). How do you ethically deal with that? When you open family closets, here be dragons, never mind the skeletons we expected.

The author's family comes from an intense mix of cultural backgrounds, and it was interesting to see how history can sometimes be rewritten in order to protect a family's reputation, or simply to hide an unwanted chapter.
