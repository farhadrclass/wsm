People who know me know that I\u2019m a sucker for novels with animal characters. So, I must admit that after catching a glimpse of the cover, I just couldn\u2019t resist picking it up. And \u2018Anyone but You\u2019 didn\u2019t disappoint! It was such a pleasant read, full of fun, love, joy, and laughter. Jennifer Crusie created a nice blend of humor, drama, romance, and emotion. I enjoyed both main characters and supporting ones, especially Fred, a super cute dog who stole the show several times throughout the book. If romantic comedy stories are your thing, then look no further. This book will brighten up your day for certain!"}, {"userName": "Buggy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099666-buggy", "userReview": "Opening Line: \u201cThe last thing Nina Askew needed was Fred.\u201dNewly divorced Nina Askew has just turned forty and found her freedom. Of course freedom from her stuffy husband and suburban home comes at a cost and Nina now finds herself a tad on the lonely side. Rambling around her apartment, watching old movies and drinking Amaretto milkshakes with her BFF just aren\u2019t cutting it anymore. She needs something else. What she needs is a puppy; a perky, rambunctious, adorable puppy. What Nina gets is Fred. (Personally I\u2019ve always believed that your dog finds you) And in return Fred finds Alex for her, the decade younger, hunky E.R doctor from downstairs.Fred. This really is his book, he absolutely steals the show here and I found that instead of falling for the hero (which is usually the case) I fell for Fred. Those opening chapters where Nina adopts his depressed, smelly, vertically challenged, morose self from the pound while trying to get herself a cheerful puppy are just brilliant. \u201cNina turned to the attendant, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d The attendant raised an eyebrow, \u201cThat\u2019s your idea of perky?\u201d Nina gestured to the puppies, \u201cThey\u2019ll all be adopted right?\u201d\u201cProbably\u201dNina took one last glance at the tumbling, chubby puppies. Prozac with four legs and a tail. Then she looked at the other dog, depressed alone. Too old to be cute anymore if he ever had been. \u201cI have a lot in common with this dog\u201d she told the attendant. Yup, dejected, moaning, bra stealing, Oreo eating, smelly, overweight, great lump of a dog. What\u2019s not to love? Anyone But You was my first Jennifer Crusie read and it was a pleasure. With a sweet, uncomplicated (older woman/younger man) romance and relaxed writing style; I can see why Crusie is so popular. This just put a smile on my face which honestly I needed because it\u2019s been a rough month.My only issues would be that their friendship seemed to develop really fast. They met and bam, they were instantly familiar, spending all their time together, watching movies, jogging and hanging out, there was no getting to know period. I also felt that the ending was a bit rushed (word count?) but these are just minor gripes The secondary characters are engaging and addictive and I can\u2019t help but hope they got their own stories (have to check into that -written in 96.)I was also pleasantly surprised by the steaminess of the love scenes. Yeah, nice! And how great is it to read about a 40 year old woman grabbing the younger hot guy. Sure she had some body issues (saggy, things not where they used to be) but this just made it all the more realistic.

I have a new favorite author. :-) This is the first book I've read by Jennifer Crusie and it will not be my last. I read most of this book with a smile on my face. What a terrific sense of humor! The print is very easy to read--double space--and the style has it flowing beautifully. This was a book I didn't tire of reading and remained engrossed in both the story and the characters. There were actually three main characters: Nina, Alex and Fred (the dog). What a character the latter was! There wasn't any arguing, but a nice well developed cast and a romance that grew with the story. I was sighing. Nina was 10 years older than Alex and for her it was a big deal. Alex was a good looking ER doctor that came from a family of doctors. His family was very messed up. Nina was recently divorced from a long-time, unhappy marriage where she was the eye-candy for her husband's career (lawyer). She loved living by (with) herself--and her dog. There were secondary characters: Charity and Max (Alex's brother) that I hope have a story out there...somewhere.

She had just turned forty-years-old and had a new apartment and a job that suited her but she was lonely. She decided it was time to adopt a cute little puppy; something her ex-husband would never consider.Instead, Fred became a part of her life; as in, a much-older half-basset, half-beagle Fred. With his droopy eyes, a yawn-like moan and a large back end. He was patient, loving and listened when Nina needed a pair of ears.This contemporary romance was originally released in 1996 and, with the exception of videos and the mention of older actors, it never felt dated. Told from two POVs, it was about a thirty-year old doctor and serial bachelor, Alex, and Nina. Unaware of each other, they rented separate levels in an old Victorian home until Fred 'introduced' them.ANYONE BUT YOU is a Harlequin and all of the the characters could have used more development. But it was goofy and lighthearted with Fred stealing the moment at various times. Up until now, Alex had taken women for granted. He was happy with short-term relationships. And Nina had some self-esteem issues that surfaced when this younger man pursued her. There was also the expected lack of communication for awhile that hindered their friendship from developing into a romance. But with Nina's BFF and Alex's brother openly giving them advice, the couple find that unconditional love really does exist."}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "This was one of my favorite romance novels back in the 90's and, being all burned out and jaded, I decided to pick it up again to see if I'd enjoy it as much as I did back before I became so grouchy.Much to my surprise, I enjoyed it from beginning to end. Though a few of the pop references are dated, the humor and the romance were both a delight to read and it brought me back to those days when I looked forward to spending an afternoon reading to my hearts content.This book is about Nina, a newly divorced 40 year old woman, who is finally living her life on her terms but she's a little lonely and decides to adopt a friend. Planning on adopting a spunky new puppy she instead falls for the soulful old eyes of a beagle mix named Fred. He smells, he's long past his youth and just looking at him makes her even more depressed but once she sets her eyes on him she can't leave him sitting in the pound and takes him home to her new apartment.Because of Fred, who mistakes neighbor Alex's window for Nina's, she gets a surprise visit from the sexy younger ER doctor. The two become immediate friends and although he'd like to become a whole lot more, Nina is reluctant because she fears she's too old for him.What follows is a book full of charm and wit and is a definite must read if you need some cheering up."}, {"userName": "Ruthie Knox", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6290063-ruthie-knox", "userReview": "Okay, I get the Crusie thing now. The first book I read by her was Welcome to Temptation, which was so-so. Then Bet Me, which kept me up late into the night, compulsively reading, and inspired a blog post in which I navel-gazed in my customary fashion. I liked Bet Me a lot, though I never could put my finger on why, exactly. But oh, oh, oh, I loved this third one.Note to anyone who ever wishes to write an older-woman, younger-man romance novel: This is how you do it. Just exactly like this. Anyone But You is the love story of forty-year-old, just-divorced editor Nina and her foot-dragging romance with the downstairs neighbor, Alex, a thirty-year-old ER doctor. They go together like Oreos and milk, only it takes Nina a while to get over the age difference and her fear of letting him see her naked and get on with her life.There was a dog in there, too, and some humor, and a plot about a novel and Nina's job and Alex's family, most of it very well done, all light-hearted and funny in that Crusie way, but honestly, I cared very little. I just wanted them to kiss already, and then when they did, I wanted them to do it again. I was a slavering fool for these two, totally rooting for the romance, absurdly pleased when everything came together at the end. I finished reading this three days ago, and I'm still kind of living in the book in one corner of my brain. *happy sigh*I want to be Jennifer Crusie when I grow up."}, {"userName": "Jane Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart", "userReview": "I love the story, but I couldn\u2019t wait for it to be over because the audiobook narrator was awful.I read the paperback several years ago and laughed a lot. I recently listened to the audiobook. I didn\u2019t laugh because I knew what to expect, but I still really enjoyed the story.I was so drawn to the characters. I loved the slow building relationship between Nina and Alex. I enjoyed other characters as well, especially the 75 year old physically fit neighbor Norma.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR - Susan Ericksen:I don\u2019t like this narrator. It feels like a bossy person is yelling at me, lecturing me, nagging me. It\u2019s jaring, irritating and stressful to listen to. There is no sweetness, softness or vulnerability in her voice. It\u2019s loud. I don\u2019t like monotone readers, but Susan Ericksen is too far the other way. I feel like she is overacting with artificial cheeriness, overly energetic. Her emotional interpretation of men is off. Alex sounds like a bossy female instead of a guy desiring her and wanting sex.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Story length: 275 pages.

It was a light, fun read with the charm and wit I expect from Crusie.The rating is a bit on the generous side as the story was pretty predictable and there were few surprises along the way. The characters were fun, though, and Crusie made a ten-year older woman feel like the perfect fit in a wonderful romantic couple. Props for that being rare and well done and an integral part of the story. I particularly liked the growth of both protagonists as they overcame their hang-ups to become more complete as people.A note about Steamy: Two and a half pretty steamy explicit sex scenes put this in the middle of my steam tolerance.

Do NOT give your dog chocolate! This bugged me to no end. Chocolate is like poison to dogs, and these characters fed their dog Oreos, which sent me into screaming fits!Now, on to the rest of the story - I stand by my rating: It was OK. The characters were likable and funny. The parallel action was also engaging. The reason for my stilted rating is that the romance felt a bit rushed and obvious to me. Romances tend to be a bit predictable, but this one was especially so. But, hey, it was a lighthearted, happy romp with an older woman falling in love with a younger man - well, and with her dog too (read the book)!"}, {"userName": "Amanda Westmont", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2359677-amanda-westmont", "userReview": "I'm a huge fan of pretty much anything Jennifer Crusie writes and this book was no exception.But...I'm not apparently a huge fan of the miscommunication plot device. (Potential non-fatal spoilers follow). I had a really hard time believing that the hero/heroine could spend hours and hours watching movies and hanging out and talking together A) without jumping each others bones and B) not ever talking about the fact that she didn't ever want the big house/ambitious man thing ever again. I mean, EVERY DAY they hang out together and she's recently divorced and it just NEVER comes up that she LOVES her new life and wouldn't want to go back to her old one under any circumstances? Believing this required an unusually painful suspension of disbelief for me and it wasn't Jennifer Crusie's fault - it's a fairly common plot device.Also, as much as I love Crusie (and I DO), I'm a little bit over the low-self-esteem protagonist. I've been nursing and/or pregnant for the past five years and even *I* am not that self-conscious about my boobs.Overall, this book was well-written, well-executed and impossible to put down, just like everything else Jennifer Crusie's ever written. I LOVE her style, too. The words disappear magically into the story and I never roll my eyes at obnoxious romantic descriptions of burning hot manhoods, which is exactly how I like my romance novels.

I've heard of Jennifer Crusie but have never read any of her books, so this will be first.From the first disc, I though the reader's voice sounded familiar. When I recognized it as Erickssen's of the In Death books, the story rose in my estimation. (Okay, I'm shallow. There are certain readers that can read me a shopping list, and I will enjoy it...LOL)It turned out to be a light-hearted story of a 40-year old woman (darn, I had to pick this just when I'm about to turn the same big 4-0) and a young (in her opinion) ER doctor. As usual, it is a comedy of misunderstoods and personal insecurities played out with a sad-eyed, Oreo-eating, dog playing as canine matchmaker, until our romantic pair would admit that they are right for each other.This is like eating Oreos, sweet and delightful in small doses, but if I eat a whole box, I'll probably be sick.

I like how it was a quick read, although it took me a few days to finish it. I would only read it on my break at work. I'm debating or rather or not I should give it 2 1/2 stars or 3 stars. I know that I have highlighted three stars.As I have said before the book is a quick read. I like reading chick lit books. Good, catcher books. I wish the book was different. There's so much that I didn't like about this book. 1. Alex was a 30 year old kid. I know that he was young, but it doesn't mean that he had to be a kid. Don't get me wrong, I know that age doesn't have anything to do with maturity. A 50 year old man can still be immature. But, Alex was a doctor. I think that he should have been a mature 30 year old doctor. Not someone that Nina seen as a kid. I don't care if he wore Daffy Duck shorts, like to watch classic movies and eating oreo cookies. I love oreos cookies by the way! I don't care if he had a baby face. I'm in my thirties. I'm very much passed 30 years old. I have a baby face. I like to watch cartoons, kid shows and even read Young Adults books. Yet, I am still a mature woman. My kid side will never die. The only time it will die is when I die. I believe every adult has a kid side. Some may not acknowledges it, but all adults have a kid side. If you have children, especially little ones, you better have a kid side. The first kid a child will play with, will be his or her parent(s). Alex has seen how his father went through wives. He was an only child his mother had, but not the only child his father had. His father was married to three women and each woman, had a child for him. So, Alex had an older brother and sister. He should have known that money can't buy love. Yet, in his immaturity, he thought that he needed more money to make Nina happy, because she was married to a rich man before.I just didn't like how Alex's character was made up. 2. Nina. I truly hate when women is caught up with looks and age. I hate when they think something is wrong with getting old. Our bodies weren't designed to stay young forever. No matter how much plastic surgery a woman gets to look young, she will never be able to change back her age. No, Nina didn't get any plastic surgery, but she didn't like how body looked, because she was 40 years old and everything wasn't perky anymore. Just because a woman is 40 years old, it doesn't mean that her body can't be perky. If a woman exercises and does strenght exercise to tone up her body, she can have a tone body too. There's an older woman in the story named Norma. She's seventy-five years old and she exercises. That's why she doesn't look her age and is in good condition. She's dating a younger man too. Rich is sixty-two years old.Alex always thought that nothing was wrong with Nina's body, even before they hooked up. I have other books by Jennifer. I don't know if they are about older women and younger men, but I hope it doesn't follow this storyline.I hope not all older women and younger men books are like this. Where the woman is worried about getting old. There are a lot of older men and younger women book and unless I have missed something, the men don't worry about getting old.Okay, I have said enough and people probably wouldn't find this as a review. But, it what I feel about the book. I'm going to go ahead and give the book three stars.I like how a friendship was started and that's important to me. I don't care if the hero and heroine are heading down a HEA, I think they should become friends first in the relationship, during the relationship and continue to be best friends until death do them part.I'm glad that both party matured and seen that looks and money isn't the answer to happiness."}, {"userName": "Duchess Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2204947-duchess-nicole", "userReview": "A sweet, funny, lighthearted romance...Jennifer Crusie's standard fare.Nina is newly divorced after fifteen years of marriage. So she's still finding out who she is by herself. But she's lonely, and decided that she needs companionship NOT of the human kind and goes to adopt a dog from the local shelter. While she wants a young, perky puppy, its the old smelly basset hound mix that steals her heart. Enter Fred, the comic relief and matchmaker of the story. Fred inadvertently sets up a meeting between Nina and her downstairs neighbor Alex when he crawls down the fire escape and in to Alex's open window. I loved Alex! There's never a point in the story that Alex turns in to a jerk. He's just a nice, easy going guy...who also happens to be a sexy ER doctor.To Nina, Alex is just the young, hot neighbor that is fun to hang out with and secretly lust after. The thought that they might have a relationship never enters her mind, because Nina is forty and Alex is thirty. Cougartown is not where Nina lives. But Alex is fascinated with her. She's beautiful and comfortable, has no expectations of him like the other women he's dated, and Nina is just so easy to be with. So Alex pines. And Nina lusts and doubts herself. Alex is charming, and both he and Nina are such happy people, living their quiet lives while the sexual tension builds. I was surprised that there is an actual sex scene involved, though you have to wait for it. Usually, Crusie's older books are pretty fade to black but Nina and Alex have enough sparks to warrant some sexy times, I guess! I really like this author.

The plot was really thin, however, and what little there was totally goes off the rails at the end\u2014I\u2019m not sure I get the logic of writing a romance novel where guy and gal get together, then immediately have a big histrionic fight.

And Alex's ignorance of the realness of her insecurities was also very true-to-life. Nina is somewhat recently out of a very one-sided marriage, and all she wants is her independence and a dog. And of course, everyone knows that a good pet can be a good connection for friendship - which is all Nina wants, since she's through with marriage. Alex, however, takes one look at Nina and definitely wants more, and the fact that he's ten years younger doesn't bother him a bit. Being a smart guy, he eventually discovers how to build that friendship into more - once he gets past his own insecurities about not being rich.So I guess I'm a convert to Jennifer Crusie, and will definitely try another of her books."}, {"userName": "Alaine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1051989-alaine", "userReview": "This was my first Jennifer Crusie novel and it was a fun easy read.

He's still the same Fred, causing trouble when he feels up to it.Another added bonus that for once it's not an older man chasing a younger woman's skirt. It's a decade older woman chasing a man's scrubs. For once, the characters have issues, and act their age. Not like a prodigies at 27. Overall, I have to give it 5 stars. It's one of the few I love rereading."}, {"userName": "Ridley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2543252-ridley", "userReview": "This one had tons of telling, over-obvious symbolism and a plot that led me around by the nose, but the characters and dialog were so damn cute that I just couldn't hold it against the book. Just charmed the pants off me, it did."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/217354-laura", "userReview": "This is one of my favorite Crusie books. The characters are well-rounded and likable, the dialog is snappy, and Fred the dog deserves his own sequel.

Alex was adorable. Nina had some oh-no-I'm-40 angst, but it only came out sometimes--she didn't obsess over it obnoxiously. Their friends were also quite likable, and I wish Max and Charity would get a book written just for them."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1710785-katie", "userReview": "This was fun! I really sped through the audiobook. They needed to TALK more at the end, but at least it wasn't your typical big misunderstanding . . . and it helped that the surrounding characters were also like, \"Um, you should talk to each other.\""}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2545195-kay", "userReview": "So after a couple of years of having an on-and-off love affair with the Bitches over at Smart Bitches, Trashy Books - I finally decided to commit. So I went with one of their must-read Romance Authors - Jennifer CrusieI chose to start my Harlequin education with Anyone But You because I figured worst comes to worst, I would love the dog. Needless to say, Fred (the canine protagonist), made the book come to life from page 1. I absolutely loved the hero, Alex, despite the fact that he was self-confident and perfectly content in himself. Huh? Well, I considering my preference in the tortured!hero in every genre, it is somewhat surprising that he resonated with me. And as for the heroine, Nina, I loved her almost as much as Alex - despite her hang up over his age.Halfway through the book, I was high as a kite. I couldn't imagine a book getting any better than the gold I had in my hands. At that moment, the book was warm, comfy, toasty, melted-butter popcorn comfort. I honestly felt wholly content while reading the frigging thing. It was almost disturbing how much I enjoyed it.But I do have one fairly major complaint that ended up knocking the book down to three and a half stars - the last forty pages. The forty pages where Jennifer Crusie decided that the characters getting together meant it was time for them to go bonkers and completely change personality. There was epic confusion, family drama, job crises, and, well, it went on. But for only forty pages. It was just plain odd. I mean, obviously, Crusie sorted it out by the end - but why it was there in the first place still confused me. I wish I could back and unread the last forty pages - because before them I had been ready to write a gushing, fangirling, five star review. Those pages ripped me out of the wonderfully comfortable world I had just gotten used to - and it was pretty shocking to the system.The book is also a little dated. Written in the mid-nineties, the cultural references aren't so out of date - but the thinking kinda is. It was a contemporary romance, without a doubt, but still the assumptions that the characters had to get over just seemed rather redundant. Maybe it's because my generation has a lot fewer barriers to leap over when it comes to love, but I really did have to push myself into believing that the relationship obstacles, were, you know, obstacles.Over all, I consider my first foray into contemporary romance section pretty darn positive. I look forward to reading other Cruise books, and of course continuing my work through the Smart Bitches Rec Pile!"}], "description": "For Nina Askew, turning forty means freedom--from the ex-husband, freedom from their stuffy suburban home, freedom to focus on what she wants for a change. And what she wants is something her ex always vetoed--a puppy. A bouncy, adorable puppy. Instead she gets...Fred.Overweight, middle-aged, a bit smelly and obviously depressed, Fred is light-years from perky. But he does manage to put Nina in the path of Alex Moore, her gorgeous, younger-by-a-decade neighbor.Alex seems perfect--he's a sexy, seemingly sane, surprisingly single E.R. doctor--but the age gap convinces Nina that anyone but Alex would be better relationship material. But with every silver-haired stiff she dates, the more she suspects it's the young, dog-loving doc she wants to sit and stay!", "title": "Anyone But You", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33732.Anyone_But_You", "average": 3.8, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1263487145l/33732.jpg", "reviews": 996, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19005.Jennifer_Crusie", "name": "Jennifer Crusie"}], "type": ["Romance", "Womens Fiction", "Romance", "Contemporary", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33732.Anyone_But_You", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6625764-anyone-but-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13547334-anyone-but-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/854757.Bet_Me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33727.Welcome_to_Temptation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/384457.Agnes_and_the_Hitman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33729.Faking_It", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33726.Crazy_For_You"]}
