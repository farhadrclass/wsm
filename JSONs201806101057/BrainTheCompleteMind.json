It is a very in-depth book so I felt like I was reading a text book. The other reason it took so long for me to read it was because of it being so big and heavy. I do most of my reading on the bus and on breaks at work, but with this book, I just read it in short spurts at a time at home. The photographs and art work is interesting! It has high quality glossy paper and a super layout with several features I especially enjoyed: the glossaries at the end of every chapter, the side notes on how to keep your mind sharp, and \"Fast Facts.\" The only thing I didn't like was often there are sentences that are incomplete. They just break off mid-sentence! Other than that, it is a very interesting science book. I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in the brain. This is a beautiful book!
