Living in New York where the news of the Chernobyl disaster dominated the news, a library fire in Los Angeles didn't get much coverage. As with other library arsons, it was not an act against a person or people, but for reasons unknown, since libraries are burned because of problems with the ideas that might be contained therein. Library visits were an important part of her life growing up, but she was now a purchaser rather than a borrower, but once started, she knew she'd found her subject for her new book, one that would provide many avenues to explore. On a personal note, those of us who love to read probably first discovered that love in a library. As Orlean describes it, \"... I wanted to write this book, to tell about a place I love that doesn't belong to me but feels like it is mine.\" I remember the light coming through the windows that Rhode Island summer of 1949, when my mother first took me to a library, and the books she chose for me. We had 2 weeks to read and return the books, but I wanted to rush back after two days and get more. The love of books was already in my DNA as part of my heritage, but it was fostered and nurtured in the various libraries I haunted growing up. As with her other books, Orlean leaves no avenue unexplored in covering her subject, whether it be the fire itself and its possible origins and the methods employed by arson inspectors, the person charged with the arson, but also the characters who played a large part in the development of libraries and of this one in particular, the architecture, the art, the efforts at reconstructing the collection lost in that fire. But most importantly, the role of libraries in communities worldwide and their changing roles in this age of instant information via a handheld device. New library buildings are replacing outdated ones, serving their communities in updated ways, and attracting a new generation of librarians who can envision the future (\"A number of them had tattoos. Many said they were drawn to the profession because it combined information management with public good.\") In the final analysis, this is Susan Orlean's love letter to libraries and what they represent beyond their role as depositories of paper and ink. The importance of the nonjudgmental openness of their nature, their availability to all and the help they can provide for those who have no other recourse, the shelter some seek within their walls, the peace one feels on walking in the door."}, {"userName": "Wendi Lee", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30649545-wendi-lee", "userReview": "I love libraries. I remember story times from my childhood library fondly, took my own daughter to our library for the first time when she was a few months old, and am often that patron with an armful of checked out books. Many of my friends from my MFA program went on to library school, and honestly, I should have done the same, because libraries are my happy place. The Library Book is Susan Orlean\u2019s nonfiction book about: the fire that nearly destroyed the Los Angeles Central Library in 1986, the history of the Los Angeles\u2019 libraries, and the vitality of libraries in general. If you\u2019ve read any of her other work, you know that her writing is engaging in a flitting way. One chapter about finding the arsonist responsible can lead to another about other infamous library fires. There is nothing dry about this book; I especially loved the sections about spirited head librarians throughout the history of Los Angeles Central Library, and would have happily read whole biographies about many of them. My stepson recently asked why we went to the library when we could just buy the books we want online (and do, indeed, buy a lot of books). \u201cBecause the library is the best thing ever!\u201d I replied. I\u2019m not sure it was a convincing argument, but maybe when he\u2019s older, I can recommend this book, which illustrates the beauty and charm of local libraries everywhere.

The book is a history of the L.A. Public Library, particularly the 1986 fire that devastated it\u2014and it makes you wish that every library system was fortunate enough to have a biographer, because Orlean pulls out the most marvelous, evocative details about it from its founding to the present day\u2014but it's also a love letter to libraries in general, which is just a wonderful thing.

If I had learned ahead of time that it is about the history of a library, I'm not sure I would have been very enthusiastic. I love to visit libraries, but reading about them strikes me as...boring. Well, have no fear -- The Library Book is just what you'd expect from Orlean, a writer of magazine journalism as well as books. It's lively and surprising and packed with information that you'll be sharing with everyone else. She starts with the story of how the Los Angeles Central Library suffered a massive fire in 1986. It destroyed hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts and damaged hundreds of thousands more. No one died in the fire, but authorities determined that it was a suspicious fire that was most likely started deliberately. She follows this story throughout the book, but the really meaty parts of the story are the fascinating history of the library and the people who were involved, and the continuing story of the life of the library, and the many people who make it run. Many parts of the book could stand alone as magazine profiles. It's an unexpectedly energetic and revealing look at a library that's full of character and characters.(Thanks to Simon & Schuster and NetGalley for a digital review copy.)"}, {"userName": "Corinna Fabre", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17106729-corinna-fabre", "userReview": "This book is a COMPLETE joy. If you love books, if you love libraries, if you love intricately woven journalism, you will devour The Library Book. The Library Book's foundation is around the story of the 1986 Los Angeles Library fire, how it happened, how the case was investigated (and who was or wasn't charged) and how the library recovered. The really beautiful thing about this book is how deftly Susan Orlean weaves together everything beyond the details of the case. She dives into the history of the library, the modern use of the library, interviews with librarians, firefighters, judges - anyone who had anything to do with this, generally speaking. She creates a story of community, redemption and passion against the back drop of books upon books upon books; a bibliophiles dream."}, {"userName": "Geoffrey", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13325518-geoffrey", "userReview": "(Note: I received an advanced electronic copy of this book courtesy of NetGalley) There is just so much that is packed into this wonderful read. Using the fire of 1986 at the Central Library as the foundation, Orlean covers among many other things: - The curious arson case that followed the ravaging fire- The history of the LA Public Library and the large cast of fascinating characters that were instrumental in its founding and development - The myriad of services currently provided at the Central Library and many of the women and men who work hard day in and day out to provide them- Book burnings throughout history- Different ways that public libraries are actively working to understand and meet patron needs of today and the futureTo understate things a bit, as a librarian I enjoyed this all immensely. However, thankfully you do not need to be actively employed as such in order to adore \"The Library Book.\" Any frequent or infrequent library user will both delight in this work and gain newfound appreciation for these public hubs of information, learning, and community."}, {"userName": "Neanderthal", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20167255-neanderthal", "userReview": "Susan Orlean, staff writer for THE NEW YORKER and author of seven books, centers THE LIBRARY BOOK on the catastrophic fire at the Los Angeles Central Library on April 29, 1986 that destroyed 400,000 books and damaged 700,000, burned for seven hours and reached a temperature of 2000 degrees. More than one-quarter of the way through the book, she notes that, before learning about the fire, she had decided that she was done with writing books because of the commitment involved, but was hooked by the sense of familiarity she felt when visiting a branch library with her first-grade son in 2011. Orlean unsentimentally describes her love of books and libraries bequeathed to her by her mother and goes on to examine the cause of the fire (arson?), the inner workings of the Los Angeles Public Library, and the role of libraries yesterday, today and tomorrow.(I received pre-publication access thanks to NetGalley.)"}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1629175-candace", "userReview": "I worked at the Los Angeles Public Library's Gardner Branch as a page in the late 1970s and it remains one of the trippiest jobs I've ever had. The library system seemed to take pleasure in staffing each branch with the least likely people for the location's demographic, which was pretty funny. The patrons--mostly Holocaust survivors, gays, seniors, and struggling middle classers, adored the African American clerk with the towering platforms, huge Afro and a gift for recommending the right book, (I even remember her name, she was so awesome.) In a neighborhood where you'd have to drive miles at the time to meet a Latino, Asian Pacific Islander or Mormon, they were all at that branch, a UN of readers and oddballs.. There was a patron with an artificial leg who loved to station himself right around a corner of the reading room and take his leg off so that patrons heading for the new fiction would be surprised by a pink leg with a shoe, sock, and garter standing alone. The shrieks! You couldn't make this stuff up.So when I heard that Susan Orlean, whom I adore, was writing a book about the fire at the Central Library, I could not wait to get my mitts on it. If anyone could write about the colorful development of the Los Angeles Public Library with verve, it's Orlean. The 1986 fire itself and the search for the perp is an intriguing story, but most moving is the response from the community in the form of individuals, corporations and businesses that stepped up in surprising ways. A local meat packing plant opened its freezers to freeze sodden books so that they might be saved--who had any idea about that? ARCO cleared offices so that the library staff would have a place to work. Hundreds of citizens helped prepare and pack books for storage. So Susan has a number of threads going in \"The Library Book\"--the fire, city and library history, and lots of statistics. Toward the end, I felt they were becoming so tangled that it was hard to stay with it. Orlean's strengths as a writer are on display in the first sections of the book; the emotional wallop of the fire to workers, patrons and citizens; tracking the characters who created and grew the library; digging into the one suspect in the terrible fire, all this is great. But toward the end the book reels out of control, badly needing an editor's steadying hand.Orlean's \"Rin Tin Tin\" is one of the most moving pieces of non-fiction I have ever read, and I just enjoyed it again. I wish \"The Library Book\" could be pulled back and the last section reconsidered. That would shoot this book to the top along with her other books.Al these years later, I'm still friends with several people I met at the Gardner Branch. Such is the power of the library.Thanks to Netgalley and Simon and Schuster for allowing me to enjoy this book."}, {"userName": "AD", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80222373-ad", "userReview": "I was delighted to read this book, which is essentially a well-researched, fascinating love story dedicated to books and libraries. In large part it explores the devastating fire in the Los Angeles Public Library in 1986 \u2013 the question of how the blaze may have started and the ambiguity over whether or not the prime suspect was guilty of arson or not, a heart-pounding description of the blaze, and a powerful testament to the idea of community in descriptions of the recovery efforts. It also covers the history of the Library and the quirky Librarians who have managed and directed the library over the years, bringing it into the future as relevant as ever. As a librarian and a book lover, I enjoyed Orlean\u2019s varied references pointing to the value and power of books, but I also learned lots of fascinating new facts (such as the process of freezing and then drying out water-damaged books from the fire, with the involvement of organisations such as McDonnell Douglas and NASA).The various chapters jumped forward and backwards across the years, which I found a little disjointed, but it did serve to keep introducing interesting aspects of the greater library story. This book will appeal to booklovers, especially those who share Orlean\u2019s appreciation of the role of librarians and the libraries they work in. It also documents an important piece of the history of Los Angeles, so will appeal to lovers of that city."}, {"userName": "Lorrie McCullers", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2953849-lorrie-mccullers", "userReview": "I can't say enough good things about this book! In \"The Library Book\", Orleans tells the story of the 1986 fire that devastated the Los Angeles Public Library, destroying 400,000 books and damaging 700,000 more. That sounds like a straightforward enough story, but Orleans is able to turn it into something so much more; she weaves in history, mystery, humor, and her own love of books and libraries to make it something extraordinary. Too often, nonfiction books are dry and don't engage the average reader. This book, however, draws you in and makes you care. You care about how the fire started, you care about the fate of all of those books, and you care about the people involved.

The book is fascinating because it covers so many years, so many people, not only staff, but others who use the library.

Interestingly, the LA fire parts are what I found least interesting, as well as the author's attempt to paint a tenderhearted portrait of the accused arsonist, a wannabe actor who couldn't tell the truth if his life depended on it. Much more thought-provoking are the descriptions of how Los Angeles libraries have become shelters and social service places for the homeless.

As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual false alarm. As one fireman recounted later, \u201cOnce that first stack got going, it was Goodbye, Charlie.\u201d The fire was disastrous: It reached 2,000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed 400,000 books and damaged 700,000 more. Investigators descended on the scene, but over thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library\u2014and if so, who? Weaving her life-long love of books and reading with the fascinating history of libraries and the sometimes-eccentric characters who run them, award-winning journalist and New York Times bestselling author Susan Orlean presents a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling story as only she can. With her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, she investigates the legendary Los Angeles Public Library fire to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives. To truly understand what happens behind the stacks, Orlean visits the different departments of the LAPL, encountering an engaging cast of employees and patrons and experiencing alongside them the victories and struggles they face in today\u2019s climate. She also delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from a metropolitan charitable initiative to a cornerstone of national identity. She reflects on her childhood experiences in libraries; studies arson and the long history of library fires; attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; and she re-examines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the library over thirty years ago. Along the way, she reveals how these buildings provide much more than just books\u2014and that they are needed now more than ever.
