I am not a skeptic--I am a Christian, and unlike Miller who was enamored of the books as a child, I really didn't come to them completely until I was a senior in college, after lots of spiritual twists and turns, and finally fully accepting that, well, the Church was where I found and celebrated the magic and the mystery of the world. So--with that in mind, I appreciated Miller's assertion that some people are predisposed to have faith and others are not. I believe it, but it is a little sad. Keeping that in mind, I think she did a pretty great job trying to understand and get meaning from the Chronicles. I was especially intrigued by the work she did with her childhood experience of it, putting it in the context of other children's books and explaining how it captured the experiences of childhood without dumbing them down or making them particularly didactic and how well Lucy worked as a main character. I did not appreciate so much her argument on Lewis's xenophobia in the second section about her own doubts. Or her idea that the nature of the God and man relationship is inherently sort of sadomasochistic (I mean really? You got some issues, babe.).  As an English-y type, some of what she wrote got to my own issues with the experience of reading and how wonderful it is and how literary criticism gets way too mean about it, and some of it was really simplistic literary criticism, which made me sad. It called to the better part of my English major nature and also reminded me why I am so turned off to that stuff. All that said, it was well written and very very readable. Her final argument is something along the lines of--isn't myth great, doesn't the way Lewis throws it all together kind of rule? Isn't it sort of transcendent? \"For, as much as our minds like to analyze, to break things down into their constituent parts in order to examine and manipulate them, we also long for synthesis, the sensation that our words and our world are connected and infused with intrinsic life.\" Um. Yeah, honey, that's what faith ideally does, infuses things with intrinsic life, yo. Otherwise it would be boring and didactic and dry and I would not be such a huge fan! It's not such a big jump. And I can't quite understand how she gets so close to that transcendent stuff and just doesn't see it. The Last Battle is probably my favorite Narnia book because it takes all of the other stories, the whole universe, in its big, loving arms, and Miller's least fave because it acknowledges that as great as they are they are somehow imperfect. We can't be BFF, but it is ok--best of luck to you, lady. I think you might get it yet."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27572-miriam", "userReview": "I don't usually read literary criticism but this is totally fascinating. It stems from Miller's personal love of the Chronicles of Narnia and goes on to analyze them, and their place in the cannon, talk about C.S. Lewis' life, his faith, the role of Christianity in the books and in his life, as well as his relationship with Tolkien. She talks about the nature of reading, the difference between reading as a child and as an adult and in my favorite parts, the dichotomy between the little girls who loved LITTLE WOMEN (me) and those who loved The Narnia books (her, and Neil Gaiman and Jonathan Franzen and Susannah Clarke which reminded me how much I loved JONATHAN STRANGE AND MR NORELL)."}, {"userName": "Shilough", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/644282-shilough", "userReview": "Many books written about C S Lewis are essentially gushing paeans, written by sycophantic acolytes. Written by a non-believer, The Magician's Book: A Skeptic's Adventures in Narnia might be described as a secular appreciation, not only of Narnia, but of Lewis' imagination as a whole, as well as its wellsprings and tributaries. As young reader, Miller fell in love with Narnia, only to become disgusted and appalled when she grew up to learn that her beloved stories had been carefully imbued by their author with Christian meaning and symbolism. Revisiting the books, she replaces her original wide eyed wonder and lost innocence with understanding and insight into Lewis' own troubled childhood, his profound faith, deep imagination, and rediscovers Narnia's \"shining wonders\". I have read most of the even marginally decent books written about C S Lewis, and was surprised by how much Miller's unique insights moved me."}, {"userName": "Monica Edinger", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221952-monica-edinger", "userReview": "I enjoyed reading this tremendously. I'm no longer a \"friend of Narnia\" as such, but like Miller, sure was as a child. Perhaps not quite as fanatic (my imaginary land of choice being Wonderland), but I did reread them too and loved the Chronicles very much (and, yes, have my Puffin box set among my favorite childhood books). Then I remember well teaching The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for the first time as a young teacher and being shocked, shocked! at the heavy-handed Christian themes. But the ten year-olds I was teaching didn't notice anymore than I did when their age. Back then I thought they should, it floored me that anyone could miss it, but I've mellowed since then and now Miller helps to explain just why children pay no attention. Makes total sense to me now because I better understand that children read with a completely different body of experience to work off us from us grown-ups. The imagination is a wonderful thing and works differently at different points in our lives. Miller writes beautifully and slips in all sorts of fascinating tidbits into this book. It is a blend of memoir, biography, criticism, journalism, and scholarship. I loved the way she wove in and out her own musings, quotes from interviews (especially those from Philip Pullman, Neil Gaiman and Susanna Clarke), clear descriptions of Lewis's more academic writing (especially on writing and reading), the relationship with Tolkien, interesting reports on more obscure books read and loved by Lewis, and just a lot on the act of reading. The one frustration for me is that there are no end notes, bibliography, or references of any sort. I'm assuming that was intentional as it is very journalistic and meant to appeal, no doubt, to a general audience, but I would have liked to have seen some of the citations."}, {"userName": "Joel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4588946-joel", "userReview": "Narnia is shrouded in darkness. The harsh King Miraz, uncle to the throne\u2019s heir, Prince Caspian, rules the land, and has made certain any memory of \u201cthe old days\u201d (as Caspian calls them) is stamped out. But Caspian\u2014having heard tales of Satyrs and Fauns, Nymphs and Dwarfs, Talking Beasts and all manner of magical creatures\u2014longs for more than the drab castle in which he lives. Risking torture and death, Caspian\u2019s new tutor, Doctor Cornelius, sneaks the young prince to the top of the highest tower overlooking the land, and revels to him two secrets. First, the stories of old Narnia are true. Second, Cornelius himself is the proof, a living relic: He is a half-Dwarf! As a being naturally uncomfortable in a land of Men, not to mention bigoted and cruel men, Cornelius has long searched for his kin: \u201cSometimes I have thought I heard a Dwarf-drum in the mountains. Sometimes at night, in the woods, I thought I had caught a glimpse of Fauns and Satyrs dancing a long way off; but when I came to the place, there was never anything there. I have often despaired; but something always happens to start me hoping again. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Caspian is shaken, simultaneously thrilled and terrified by his tutor\u2019s nature; the boy\u2019s fantasy has been revealed as true. He has discovered the Numinous. In another of Lewis\u2019 work, The Problem of Pain, the author explains the concept:Those who have not met this term may be introduced to it by the following device. Suppose you were told there was a tiger in the next room: you would probably know that you were in danger and would probably feel fear. But if you were told \u2018There is a ghost in the next room\u2019, and believed it, you would feel, indeed, what is often called fear, but of a different kind. It would not be based on the knowledge of danger, for no one is primarily afraid of what a ghost may do to him, but of the mere fact that it is a ghost. It is \u2018uncanny\u2019 rather than dangerous, and the special kind of fear it excites may be called Dread. With the Uncanny one has reached the fringes of the Numinous. Now suppose that you were told simply \u2018There is a mighty spirit in the room\u2019, and believed it. Your feelings would then be even less like the mere fear of danger: but the disturbance would be profound. You would feel wonder and a certain shrinking\u2014a sense of inadequacy to cope with such a visitant and of prostration before it\u2014an emotion which might be expressed in Shakespeare\u2019s words \u2018Under it my genius is rebuked\u2019. This feeling may be described as awe, and the object which excites it as the Numinous. Laura Miller\u2019s fine book is in large part an exploration of wonder. At nine she was lent a copy of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and was transported to a new land; the strength of her desire for this land would never be eclipsed, even into adulthood. I was a little apprehensive picking The Magician\u2019s Book up for the reason I avoid books about Narnia by Christians. I rather imagine the latter as dull catalogs of the parallel images in the Gospels and the Chronicles. I thought this book would be some experiment to try to strip Christianity from the Chronicles, or perhaps an argument against them predicated on the faith\u2019s nasty influence on children. I was happily proven wrong. Miller is a religious skeptic, true, and has hard things to say about the faith. But she does not set out to attack Lewis\u2019 work as some pernicious attempt to brainwash the young and credulous. She loved the books as a girl, and while her heart was broken at thirteen years of age when she discovered the books\u2019 Christian understanding, she remembers her experience fondly, even with yearning. Because she may not be able to look at the Chronicles now without coming face to face with Lewis\u2019 faith, but she retains that first, unsullied experience. I sympathize with Miller. The way some people talk you\u2019d think the Chronicles were a sort of Sunday School textbook. (A worksheet idea: Two columns, the first containing scenes and characters from Narnia, the second containing scenes and characters from the Bible. Match them up! Example: The ropes that bind Aslan are analogous to the tefillin of the Pharisees.) Narnia seemingly meant less to the young me than it did to other children, a fact I attribute to that world being explained to me much too soon. When it is established that a world like Narnia must be explained and understood by our own world, then Narnia ceases to be a world of its own. When the Chronicles became a sort of Children\u2019s Edition of the New Testament, I lost interest. Not because I found the New Testament uninteresting, but because I had already got the New Testament and I preferred it not to be watered down by stories for children. A man once complained of a tendency of his aunt\u2019s. It seems she was a terrific painter, and enjoyed nothing more than landscapes. But she felt guilty in painting for the sake of painting, so at the bottom of each finished painting she would write a verse from the Bible. Her paintings, the man observed, became mere illustrations of Bible verses. Now there is no problem with Biblical illustrations, but nor is there a problem with painting for its own good. Lewis didn\u2019t write The Chronicles of Narnia to be pedagogical. He did not set out to write an extended allegory (a point which Miller thoroughly puts to rest, explaining at length the nature and purpose of an allegory, in Lewis\u2019 own words), nor did he write an Everyman morality story. He wrote, rather, a series of fantastical novels for children. Miller grasps all this thoroughly. To understand the Chronicles, she argues, you must read them as a child. Children thrill at talking animals, at characters their own age doing heroic things (without anyone condescending to marvel at their feats despite their youth), at magic and adventure and all the rest. They do not thrill at parsing parallel meanings in texts, and allegory cheapens the adventure. Besides, children are under a restriction of language. To them, as Miller explains at length, Jesus was a bearded man in robes and sandals who lived in a desert country here on Earth. Aslan was a lion who lived in the woods in a different world altogether. Children\u2019s understanding of language prevents them from a phenomenological understanding of Jesus Christ, and they cannot properly see the Jesusness in Aslan. This is why we teach children bible stories and graduate to Paul\u2019s Epistle to the Romans later on when abstractions are a bit easier to get hold of. I\u2019m less convinced Miller understands why the Chronicles are, then, so very Christian. Lewis was one (a Christian), but that only goes so far. He may have known few children as an adult but having been one once himself, he\u2019d seemed to held on to the important bits of childhood. He remembered the wonder he felt at, for example, Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle and George MacDonald\u2019s Phantastes; he didn\u2019t remember the life lessons, the morals, the instruction he got from them. He was not being sneaky, trying to trick children into learning the gospel truths. Nor was he, of course, writing for adults, who would \u201cget it\u201d. To a certain extent Lewis was exhibiting the natural and acceptable desire for his readers to return to his books. He was thoroughly bookish by nature; he did not simply read, he dwelt on books, and they stayed with him. In that sense the Christianity of the Chronicles is an Easter egg, or series of eggs, to be found later. The eight-year-old may \u201conly\u201d enjoy an excellent fairy story. That same child may come back four or five years later and enjoy the story on a new, yet unseen level. Naturally some children will react as Laura Miller did; she was scandalized, betrayed, appalled upon her eventual discovery of the bald faith of the stories (she first read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe at nine, first discovered its Christianity at thirteen). The egg she found, in other words, seemed to smell funny. But on a deeper level Lewis wanted children to experience the Numinous at a young age. Miller revisits Narnia because she remembers her profound love for that imaginary place, and growing out of it. She cannot reclaim or rediscover the wonder, the joy of that place, and the series, while it has had a lasting effect on her life, is essentially relegated to childish nostalgia. She experiences wonder vicariously through her three-year-old friends, but does not feel it herself. Lewis\u2019 tales acknowledge the adult\u2019s difficulty finding joy again. He does not treat children\u2019s imagination as gullibility or a lack of sophistication to be humored for a time; he treats imagination as spiritual vulnerability and openness. Incidentally this is another reason the Chronicles cannot be passed off as allegory or mere allusion. They are as profoundly theologically speculative as his space trilogy; he was clearly fascinated with the soteriological implications of other life. Narnia is not a mere fairy story; the land existed parallel to our own, and beings from each world travelled to and from the other. In the space trilogy, at least five different sentient species interact with the Creator in different ways. Close-mindedness to the possibility of other life may be seen as a form of covetousness. Lewis used the different worlds with their different beings as a way to explore the untold depths of the mystery of life with God (see also his speculations on gender at the end of Perelandra). Thus the joy found in fairy tales is a foretaste of the joy found in the spiritual life. Children do not recognize this, nor ought they have to. To explain it away is to sap the experience of the thrill of it, the healthful fear of the unknown, of things larger than oneself, but also the love of beauty. So when Miller says something like \u201cNarnia and Aslan wanted me to be happy. Jesus wanted me to be miserable,\u201d you know something is amiss. That sort of sentiment is heartbreaking. Miller explains a child\u2019s inability to quite understand the Jesusness of Aslan, bound by childish understanding, but she, looking back as an adult, still does not see past her childish understanding of Aslan and Jesus. Some of Miller\u2019s religious confusion, however, seems willful. A few examples: She recalls a crisis of faith she had as a child. She heard in catechism that unbaptized babies who died would be condemned to eternity in limbo. She was upset that there weren\u2019t hard and fast answers as to why such and such was the case, or presumed to be the case\u2014it was too hazy; but one gets the impression she would have found a point-by-point justification of the theory to be a little too neat. Elsewhere, she muses for some pages on Freudian interpretations of Lewis and his work, because he may or may not have been influenced by Freud, whose sway was great at that time. But because Freud was popular in Lewis\u2019 time does not justify her Freudian evaluation of Lewis. Nor does her implication that all Christian believers may just be closet sadomasochists hold water just because Lewis struggled with that attraction. She objects to the fact no piece of Christian art has touched her as much as the sensuousness of Lucy and Susan touching Aslan in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, accusing the centuries of Christian iconography to be filled with little more than \u201cmangled eroticism.\u201d She says of pity, \u201cwe pity those we regard as less than ourselves: animals or simpletons.\u201d This only intensifies the insult when only a few pages later she says of Graham Greene, \u201c[he] was a Catholic who was unfortunate enough not to lapse and this made him morose.\u201d Finally she cites Puddleglum\u2019s (the Marsh-wiggle in The Silver Chair) defiance of the Green Lady as Lewis\u2019 defense of theism. In that story the witch has almost convinced the four heroes their memory of life outside of bondage to her is a dream. Puddleglum breaks the spell, saying, \u201cFour babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow.\u201d Miller construes this as Lewis saying, \u201cWell, maybe there isn\u2019t much good reason to defend Christianity, but it\u2019s a nice, warming idea\u201d (my words). I don\u2019t feel compelled to answer these or other claims because, as I said, I suspect they aren\u2019t sincere. Miller makes it clear she rejects the faith because she finds it uninteresting. And besides, Narnia is the wrong context to argue doctrine. If Miller had taken issue with Lewis\u2019 faith in Mere Christianity or Screwtape, that would have been one thing. But the Chronicles are rather more about the mysterious depths of spiritual sensation. The same thrill children feel at a wonderful story, whether The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe or Squirrel Nutkin can be felt through communion with God. Indeed, a child\u2019s reaction to a good fairy story is a foretaste of that deeper, more satisfying spiritual realization. * * * Miller\u2019s book is much about the spirituality of Narnia and her difficulty with it. But I can only underemphasize the loveliness of the other bits. I had an epiphany while reading The Magician\u2019s Book. I began this post in the scene from Prince Caspian wherein Caspian and Cornelius stand looking over the ramparts of the high tower, star-gazing, pursuing the thrill of a deeper reality. I was not as much affected as a child by Narnia as I was by, say, Brian Jacques\u2019 Redwall books. But I realized, thinking of Caspian\u2019s epiphany, that it is those same ramparts my mind\u2019s eye sees when it watches the advance of Birnam Forest (Macbeth, Act V, Scene 5) (And for the record, I read Macbeth many years after the Chronicles). Such is the impact Lewis\u2019 stories have had on my imagination. Miller\u2019s search for the British inspirations for Narnia\u2019s landscape is endearing, however elusive she realizes her goal to be. When not dabbling in Freudianism, Miller\u2019s treatment of the psychology of Lewis in writing the Chronicles is rewarding. He was a man trapped in a society of a sort of gentlemanly machismo. We can guess how encouraged he\u2019d feel sharing his children\u2019s fairy stories to his friends the Inklings when, upon J. R. R. Tolkien sharing an installment of the Lord of the Rings, Hugo Dyson exclaimed, \u201cNot another fucking elf!\u201d Miller finds in the character of Lucy Pevensie a rough analog of Lewis, or perhaps a projection. The little girl heroine, under no obligation to perform feats of might in battle, signifies the soft, tender side of Lewis\u2019 spirituality. She, more than any other human character in the Chronicles, makes herself spiritually vulnerable, open to the Numinous. \u201cPeople,\u201d Miller writes, \u201cread criticism of works they already know well because they hope to expand their understanding, perhaps even to relive the experience through someone else. Great critics show us new dimensions of a book or a film, but they also articulate what it feels like to encounter the work, a sensation many of us can\u2019t adequately capture on our own.\u201d I enjoyed The Magician\u2019s Book because it was nice to walk back through Narnia with someone else who knew the land. I suspect Miller may disagree with me on this point; she feels the books are much more personal to readers, and tells of how regardless of how enamored she was with the stories as a child, she never shared them with anyone. But this book never would have been written if she had not wanted to share her love with Narnia, no matter how conflicted that love has become. Nor would the Chronicles have ever been written. In the end, it is by Lewis speaking through Doctor Cornelius we can understand why he wrote his fair stories: \u201cYou [, Caspian] may well ask why I say [these things] at all. But I have two reasons. Firstly, because my old heart has carried these secret memories so long that it aches with them and would burst if I did not whisper them to you. But secondly, for this: that when you become King you may help us, for I know that you also, Telmarine though you are, love the Old Things.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/736266-nikki", "userReview": "Book reviewer and Salon.com co-founder Laura Miller fell in love with Narnia in the second grade when her teacher handed her a copy of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Several years later, Laura, by then a lapsing Catholic and a junior-high student, read that C.S. Lewis's intent in writing the Chronicles of Narnia had been a recasting of Christian doctrine for children. She felt snookered and angry and did not revisit Narnia for many years. During those years, the Christian aspect of the Narnia books has come still more to the forefront, to the point that most discussion of the books seems to focus on that aspect alone; not to mention the Christian-evangelical-produced films released recently. From numerous tomes by evangelicals to the hatred professed by fantasy writer/atheist Philip Pullman, it seems that no one can any longer view the Narnia books other than through the lens of one's own belief or unbelief. Laura Miller, still a skeptic, manages to take a much more balanced look at the series in this excellent book.A few years ago, Miller decided to revisit Narnia, wrote a column on Salon.com about it, and thereby started a fascinating conversation with other Narnia-lovers which led to the book. She combines memoir, biography, and literary criticism in the wide-ranging work. She explains that the Chronicles are not, in fact, allegory, as sloppy thinkers are fond of calling them; compares and contrasts Lewis and his friend Tolkien (who didn't think much of the Chronicles for his own reasons); references Northrop Frye and Ingmar Bergman as well as George MacDonald and Charles Williams. If you don't care for fantasy and never wished to visit Narnia, this book will not change your mind and you might as well skip it. But for anyone who has ever enjoyed the books -- whether you reread them regularly or not, whether you are a believer or a skeptic -- The Magician's Book will enrich your thinking about reading in general and The Chronicles of Narnia in particular. Highly receommended."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3212534-laura", "userReview": "(Apologies in advance: this is less of a review than it is a reader's response -- more about me than it is about the book. Please feel free to move on down the road.) :-)I may be remembering incorrectly, but I think the Narnia books were the first books I ever loved best. I didn't get the whole paperback box set at once -- it was years before I read The Horse and his Boy, for one, and I think The Magician's Nephew was on a bit of a time delay for me too -- but those & then the Anne of Green Gables series*, I still have them from when I was a kid, and I'll still reread them as a grownup. (See also: every Madeleine L'Engle kids'/YA book.)Anyway. I grew up Methodist; as a little kid, I never noticed the religious symbolism in the Chronicles, and then as a big kid I felt like a bit of a dummy for not having noticed. ('Cause seriously, *duh*.) Some of it didn't sit quite right with me. For example, in The Last Battle, the Calormenes were OBVIOUSLY supposed to be Muslims, but their god Tash was more like the Devil than like Allah, who (I thought) was just \"our\" God with a different name.Later still, I became the kind of person who thinks Kevin Smith's Dogma gets it just about exactly right. I read The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster and wished that, if there is a supreme deity out there, that the FSM is it. And I felt... not exactly *angry* about the Narnia books, but vaguely bummed out. You know in \"A Christmas Story\", when Ralphie finishes decoding the Little Orphan Annie secret message, and it's \"a crummy commercial. Son of a bitch\"? Yeah, kind of like that.This feeling was exacerbated a few months ago, when I read a lovely essay on Susan Pevensie. Before then, I'm ashamed to say, I had never really thought about what has been called \"the Susan problem\" -- namely, that she got kicked out of Narnia for growing up & becoming a woman. I was troubled about these books that I loved, but was no longer sure how I could share them with my nieces and nephews. (I figured that for sure I'd be putting a copy of that essay into the back of the book, into The Last Battle most likely. Figured I'd put one in the back of my copy as well.) I was looking for more material about the Susan problem -- and yes, I found the Neil Gaiman story, The Problem of Susan) -- when I came across Ms. Miller's book. One Abebooks order later, this former resident of the Columbus Metropolitan Library was mine.WOW. This book addressed all my concerns about Narnia, plus some that I didn't know I had. Sexism? Yup. Racism (in the portrayal of the Calormenes, for one)? Yup. Sales pitch for Christianity? Yup. Still freaking awesome stories that I loved, love, and will share with the children I love? YUUUUUUUP.Because there *is* more to the books than just thinly-veiled religious tracts. Narnia is a beautiful world, created from a patchwork of myths, legends, stories, and traditions that C.S. Lewis enjoyed; he gathered them up and synthesized them all into this place that kids (of all ages) have wanted to escape into; some have believed it was real. Many more, even if we didn't quite believe, have wished it were.This is going to sound corny as hell, but I'm not going to say Miller \"redeemed\" Narnia for me -- she showed me that Narnia's redemption, however much or little it needed one, was already within me. The books, like their author, have some flaws; but who and what does not? The flaws cannot, do not, outweigh the beauty and the truth of these stories. C.S. Lewis argued that sometimes, fairy tales are the best way of saying what needs to be said. Actually, I first encountered this idea in Madeleine L'Engle Suncatcher (a book I still need to finish); L'Engle is quoted as saying that myths can be \"truer\" than facts, because myths transcend situations and contexts. For me, Narnia still has its truth and its beauty. Laura Miller helped bring it back.I can't sum up all of Miller's arguments. She is a literary critic; I am not. I'll just say that this book was a lovely, enjoyable feat of analysis. (I read books all the time about people doing things I can't do -- ballet dancers, hockey players, witches & wizards, you name it. Here, the book *was* the thing I can't do. That was weird but kind of cool.) But here's one passage that really struck a chord with me.Fairies, neither angels nor men, neither good nor evil, have no place in God's plan. That is the real source of their appeal and their threat, and the reason why fundamentalists object to witches, wizards, and other occult elements in children's books. It's not that these figures lure readers to Satanism, but that they introduce the possibility that God and Satan are not your only options. Whether or not you believe in fairies, they stand for that choice, for the third road. (276)I guess, personally, I've edged towards that third road as I've gotten older. Especially lately, the growing bubbles of religious fundamentalism in our society have driven me there. But the third road, it's a nice place. I seem to be in good company here. And I can still love Narnia too.* Ms. Miller argues that there are \"two kinds of readers: those who liked Little Women and those who liked The Phantom Tollbooth\" (234-235), because there are essentially two kinds of books -- \"novels\" (literal tales of everyday life) and \"romances\" (transformational adventure stories, sometimes with magic). It's interesting to me that Narnia and Anne Shirley's PEI were the two worlds I love(d) best as a kid, since apparently I'm both kinds of reader! And hey, why not double down: Madeleine L'Engle is both kinds of *author*."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura", "userReview": "I\u2019m a sucker for literary criticism. I mostly enjoyed the first two thirds of this book, though there were times that it seemed more like Eat, Pray, Love, (a book I utterly despised) than anything the Last Action Hero of Literary Criticism, Harold Bloom would have written. For those who do not know me, I found that . . . off putting. As a founding member of Salon.com, Miller has had a rare opportunity to talk to authors who have wrestled hard with C. S. Lewis over the years. Neil Gaiman, Philip Pullman, Jonathan Franzen, and Susanna Clarke all get fawning shout outs through the book. Gaiman\u2019s story The Problem of Susan helped me put my thumb on why, the more I thought about Narnia over the years, the less I liked it. There are lots of little gems in this text. I have heard rumors of Lewis\u2019s sado-masochism over the years, but this is the first that puts it squarely into his story. I never realized Lewis was Irish, which makes Tolkien\u2019s frustration with him converting from Atheism to High Church make more sense. I was amused to learn that he \u201crepudiated [T.S. Eliot] as \u2018a very great evil.\u2019\u201d (224). While I don\u2019t share her sense of betrayal when she realized that Narnia was a Christian allegory, I had a similar moment of anger when I realized just how racist and sexist the text was. This book was at least as much about Tolkien as it was about Lewis, which made me feel like the book needed a different title (I know authors rarely title their own books, so I try not to hold it against them). Lewis and Tolkien had an intertwined literary life, at least for a while, after all, and I had not realized until I read this book just how frustrated Tolkien was at Lewis for being so darn syncretic. Then I hit this passage: \u201cI finally tackled The Lord of the Rings, burning through it over the course of a summer . . . By that point, I recognized that, as much as I liked it, Tolkien\u2019s freakishly prodigious powers of invention could not supply the book with what four years of studying English literature had led me to expect from a great novel. I relished The Lord of the Rings, and have reread it several times since then. I awaited each installment of Peter Jackson\u2019s three-part film version with excitement and even delved into the \u2018mythological\u2019 texts collected in The Silmarillion \u2013 the province, really, of the hardcore fan, the geek. But by the time I left college I had read Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles, and Absalom, Absolom! And Crime and Punishment \u2013 to name just three books with related themes \u2013 and knew they sounded depths that Tolkien never touched.\u201d (214)And I\u2019m left open mouthed and grumpy. Miller presents this unprovoked slam on Tolkien as self-evident and worthy of saying. She might even be right, though it is not at all evident to me that that is so. I too had four years of studying English Literature, for what it\u2019s worth. I too have read Hardy, Faulkner, and Dostoyevsky. I mark a book\u2019s depths by how deep it goes when I think hard about it. I have not reached the depths of any of these. Miller does not make similar slams on the living authors whose work she evokes (who she might run into at dinner parties and perhaps professionally as a book critic). It\u2019s like she needs to show us that she is A Serious Literary Critic by dissing a seminal text of genre fiction, but she doesn\u2019t have the cojones to do it to someone she might need to interview some day. That passage and similar ones (she takes the time to compare Tolkien\u2019s characters unfavorably to Jane Eyre and his style unfavorably to Lolita, for example) really soured me on this book. It\u2019s like she really needs to make sure I know she\u2019s not a fellow geek and has contempt for my tribe.

No, I'm not telling you the title today. Mebbe tomorrow.)

I mean c'mon, sure I'm an acamodemic and spend a whole lot of time looking at citations, advising people on how to cite sources, helping people find sources, so I think that if you are going to reference C.S.

I would have been just fine with simply that, but the title here is misleading, which, frankly, I should have expected coming from Miller. Instead of marking territory for a battle, she embarks on a pleasantly meandering, extremely graceful journey where she reflects on the books children fall in love with (particularly bookish children, as Miller and I'd expect most of us in these parts were), and the pain experienced when those stories are necessarily outgrown, before finally asking if it is at all possible to rediscover that magic as an adult. But Miller's focus is also multifaceted, and in chapters that essentially function as stand-alone chapters, she delves into a very pragmatic examination of something I think has been greatly obscured in current Lewis studies: what part C.S. Lewis the serious and dazzlingly well-read literary critic, rather than C.S. Lewis, everyone's favorite theologian, played in the creation of Narnia. Miller doesn't sidestep the daunting task of teasing apart the strands of Lewis's varied influences, both secular and sacred, often with intriguing results. Also, from her investigation of the storied Lewis/Tolkien friendship and professional relationship emerges a much more complex portrait than usually portrayed. A very enlightening read and to also, to its great credit, a very easy read (Miller has a knack for relating more intricate literary terms and concepts in a way that the casual reader can easily grasp).

In particular, how is one to face the fact that one's beloved fantasy world is in fact an elaborate hodgepodge of myth fronting a Christian allegory? For the author, The Chronicles of Narnia were a gateway into a lifelong love of literature, not merely escapism. Miller's style can be irritatingly conversational and the book is repetitive--at times it reads like one of Lewis's ambling walks in the Irish countryside. And as it has been nearly twenty years since I last journeyed in Narnia, I was probably not the target audience for this book, there were times when I nearly put it aside. That would have been a mistake. Rather than simply dissecting the allegory and writing an apologia for Lewis's admittedly mediocre fantasy world, Miller bites off far more than I expected, examining the craft of storytelling itself. Miller most certainly did her research on Lewis's life, academic contributions, and friendships (the exchanges between Tolkien and Lewis concerning Anglo-Saxon were incredibly illuminating--Tolkien was still smarting over the \"disaster\" of the 1066 Norman conquest), but I would have enjoyed a deeper consideration of Lewis's Christianity and its bearing on Narnia.

And such beautiful illustrations on the cover! No disappointment here. Miller takes the reader step-by-step through the initial miracle of her discovery of Narnia through a well-loved-teacher; through her feelings of betrayal at realizing the Chronicles' widely aknowledged \"true intent\" (telling the story of Christ), causing her to reject the story's magic; to a burning desire to analyze both emotions and return once again to Narnia with comprehensive knowledge of both the stories and the man who wrote them.

Since I was not familiar with the author (as least I don\u2019t recall reading anything by her previously) I did not have any preconceptions about her style, likes, or dislikes. Nor, did I anticipate what \u201cA Skeptic\u2019s Adventures in Narnia\u201d would be about, except for the obvious. Ultimately, I have decided it is very worthy of reading.It has been a long time since I read \u201cThe Chronicles\u201d and I have not seen any of the movies (the movies LM really does not like, BTW), but I do have positive memories of the books. I was never head-over-heels gaga about them, but they are worth a re-read and thanks to a friend I have a copy to do so with. The same friend (whose opinion I value and trust) read this book right before me and like me eventually gave it a favorable rating.So, back to \u201cThe Magician\u2019s Book\u201d: Ms. Miller has a pretty straightforward writing style which, if she writes this way in her articles and reviews, makes her material accessible to the vast majority of readers. Except for a few patches, I flowed along with her narrative quite easily. Since I was unsure/unfamiliar with her brand of \u201cliterary criticism\u201d, I kept wondering where the dense, \u201cerudite\u201d sections were. I guess that is the difference between academic and non-academic \u2018lit. critc.\u2019I have also known of C.S. Lewis\u2019s other writings and activities, but with the exception of reading his SF trilogy, knowing of his membership in The Inklings and friendship with J.R.R. Tolkien at Oxford University, and his reputation as a Christian Apologist, I knew few specifics. While it may be one woman\u2019s opinion, this book does a pretty decent job of filling in many of those blanks about Mr. Lewis.At the top of this review I wrote \u201cuneven\u201d. I guess that is a good description of my impression of this book. I read the introduction and the first chapter thinking that this was all very nice and good \u201cbackground\u201d (they were mostly about the author and her feelings about these books and Children\u2019s Books in general) and wondering when the \u201canalysis\u201d was going to begin in earnest. And chapter after chapter it just kept going along in the same style.That was good, as noted above, because the style is readable and the nuggets of \u201cscholarship\u201d that are put in the text have both context and human interest. Not just of the author, but of a small selection of others that she interviewed and cites throughout the book.But I stayed puzzled about why this book would be considered \u201cliterary criticism\u201d. (Ok, just shoot me if you think I\u2019m extra dense or na\u00efve, but hear me out first!) To me this book was more an autobiography of Laura Miller and a biography of Clive Staples Lewis, than any kind of critique of \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d. Why, because the preponderance of material in the book is about those two people, not the actual books. It wasn\u2019t until I read the back outside cover blurb that I realized that the goal of the book wasn\u2019t really about the actual tales, but how they affected their readers. Then, the style of the book made a bit more sense. I think that the author could have made this clearer in her introduction.But, having accepted the goal of the book, I\u2019m not quite ready to stop whining about the content. There are passages where Ms. Miller is just overly, and there really isn\u2019t a better word for it, \u201cself-indulgent\u201d. Yes, given the autobiographical nature of the book she can\u2019t help but write about herself, but what I refer to are pieces that I think are just embody \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d material. In general they are not more than a paragraph and often only a sentence or a phrase, but they jarred my reading and made me think less of her and her editor. I suspect that I am not the only person to feel this way.Her approach to how other people liked and understood the books had merit, but it was a pretty small, never varying group for the entire book. I think a bit more diversity in her contributors would have been better. There were a lot of people of \u201ca certain age\u201d but almost no really \u201cfresh\u201d comments (i.e., no young or adolescent readers giving their initial impressions.) Perhaps she only wanted the older, more considered opinions of those she included.I actually think that this is a really good book even if you have never heard of or read any of Lewis\u2019s books. There is enough good biography of three people here (Miller, Lewis, and Tolkien) and references to books (Lewis and other authors against whom he is popularly compared) to keep the average, omnivore reader interested. That\u2019s how I would describe myself, since I regularly read both fiction and non-fiction of a wide variety.If someone has incredibly strong and narrow religious convictions (of any persuasion) that might detract from one\u2019s pleasure and interest. But for those who are curious or open-minded, his Christian \u201cfacets\u201d are very interesting. Likewise his \u201cprofessional\u201d work as a English professor and writer held my attention. Ms. Miller explains with great detail and insight how and why Lewis loved literature. If nothing else, this book has made me consider getting copies of some of his literary books, if not the Christian ones.While not as prolific like many light fiction authors, Lewis was and should be considered an influential writer. He had specific ideas about what made a tale good and able to hold one\u2019s attention, just like his friend and contemporary, Tolkien. They each approached the task from different motivations and in different ways, but produced works that are still read and talked about (and now seen) today. Initially I was surprised by the length and depth of the Tolkien-related material in \u201cThe Magician\u2019s Book\u201d, but after finishing the book, it felt perfectly natural. And in writing about it, I find that while personally pleased by its inclusion, it is in balance to the other themes and details of Lewis\u2019s life.If you want a line-by-line analysis of \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d, then this book will not suffice. However, if you want a book that gives you a personal glimpse into how one person feels and felt about these books, their author, and how those feelings changed and evolved, then I think you will like this book. Just think of it as a book readers\u2019 auto-biography about an influential author.One last thing (added to my original version from last evening): Ms. Miller does an excellent job of writing about what influenced C. S. Lewis and allowed him to create such an enduring series. Her description of his upbringing, youth, and environment was strongly supportive of the idea that Lewis maintained his \"inner child\" throughout his life. In defense of this, she skillfully draws on his books, letters, and musings (as recorded by his brother). To that end she also visited Ireland and England in pursuit of further understanding. This respect for the author (versus veneration of the Christian) is at the core of the book and makes it feel very even-handed. It's just another reason to go out and get this book for yourself."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929592-jon", "userReview": "I don't think I've ever read a book of lit crit so quickly or with so much enjoyment. A blurb on the back describes it as \"conversational, embracing, and casually erudite\" which is exactly right. Laura Miller talks about everything from Beowulf to Led Zeppelin, from Little House on the Prairie to Lolita, all with equally fresh insight. She makes her own prejudice perfectly clear: she is a lapsed Catholic and has no patience whatever with Christianity in any form, and she even describes Graham Greene as \"a Catholic who was unfortunate enough not to lapse and this made him morose.\" When she discovered at the age of 13 that the Narnia books, which she loved far above all others, were \"really\" just thinly disguised Christian apologetics, she felt so betrayed that she didn't pick them up again for years. Nevertheless, she DID eventually go back to Narnia, and she is wonderfully even-handed in her description of the joy the Chronicles still give her. A terrific book on the unique pleasures of reading, where those pleasures come from, and how important they are. She summarizes clearly and at length the fair criticisms of Lewis that he was sexist, elitist, and prejudiced, and she does not try to explain them away. She even describes in detail I have never seen before his struggle with sado-masochism. But the vast majority of the book is spent describing the history of fairy stories and romance, and in analyzing what makes good writing, with Lewis as the prime example but with reference to many other writers.

As a Christian myself, I was preparing for something that was perhaps bitter or deconstructionist, but it is neither. Like Lewis himself, Miller has a talent for presenting a complex subject in a concise and direct manner, well organized and reasoned without being dry.Miller reveals the influences that led to Narnia, from country Irish landscapes to the British Empire's encounter with the Middle and Far East, from boarding schools to medieval cosmology, from Norse gods to Greek heroes. One of the most fascinating chapters deals with the contrast between Tolkien's purist approach to language and culture, and Lewis' more inclusive patchwork: Anglo vs. Irish, Catholic vs. Protestant, one vs. many.She preserves the sense of wonder and mystery of her subject even while she examines its structure and origins, something which is difficult to do at all, let alone do well.

Miller can't possibly personally ruin Narnia because she loves the books so much; this is not her goal here. Like so many readers and writers out there, Narnia was Milller's- and my - first literary adventure, that book or books that all other books and stories are judged against, that place you so desperately wanted to be real, the literary touchstone. This book details her love for Narnia, how she fell out of love, and back into appreciation and respect for the books and the author. Along the way, she writes about Lewis's own literary influences, his friendship and falling out with Tolkien, his education and background, career and Christianity (and her own lack of faith), his ideas about myth making and storytelling.

Its vaue as literature takes it way beyond its foundation in faith. Miller's crisis about how you could like this book and hate Christianity is not called for. It is beside the point.So there was a basic stupidity at the heart of this argument which led Miller into trying to appreciate Narnia through the \"back door\". This leads her into a lot of irrelevent English major nonsense about Freud, Tolkien and Northrop Frye (no disrespect)which is quite unecessary to appreciate the Chronicles.On the other hand, when she wasn't overwrought and going on about sado-masochism and Lewis' powerful witches, Miller did give some sensitive and insightful readings of the books.

What The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe did for her when she first opened its pages, it did for me too. This book actually made me tear up in places, because I finally feel like I've met someone who understands my love for Narnia, and my ability to believe in it still, even as an adult.

I opened the hinged cover of a book and did the same.\u201dNarnia is the most beautiful landscape I've ever travelled to. Whenever I am asked what fantasy-realm I would prefer to live in, Narnia has always been and will always be the answer. It's a world so rich, so detailed, so magnificent and so real, that I still find myself eyeing large wardrobes suspiciously to this very day. I cannot drink a cup of tea without thinking of the dear Mr. Tumnus, and I will never be able to look at the light from a lamp-post in the snow, without hazy memories of childhood fantasies flooding back to me. Lucy walked through a wardrobe and I followed her every step on the way, wishing it was me all along.No matter how many Christian motifs and obscure analysis Narnia holds, it will always be my dreamland. That is why I have always treated any literary criticism on the subject very carefully. In fact, I have avoided them entirely. They might be true, but they're not real to me.However, I found myself longing to read Miller's criticism ever since I heard about it the first time. Mainly because she is exactly like me and any other admirer of Lewis' chronicles. She too has loved (and still loves) the stories of Narnia, and she too has felt betrayed by any hidden symbolism the books may hold. What I particularly love about \"The Magician's Book\" is that it almost entirely ignores the theme of religion that hides within the Narnia-universe. Miller argues that the theme of religion in Narnia is a topic that has been written about so many times before, that it is almost exhausted. And I agree with her, and thank her for this refreshingly new angle at the Chronicles.Each chapter of this book is entitled with a lovely and symbolic headline, and each chapter begins with a small anecdote that evolves into analytical and insightful explanations of C. S. Lewis; his past, his surroundings and his life, the ideology/history behind Narnia, the actual events and quotations within the chronicles - along with Miller's own personal reaction towards them and the reactions of contemporary writers and Lewis' inner circle. Comparisons between the chronicles, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and even the poetry of Wordsworth and Coleridge are made, and Tolkien plays a heavy role throughout the pages.The book is very easy to read, but it also lacks academical structure. Parts of it almost resembles a biography of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, while other parts seem to be depending entirely on subjective emotions. Some of Miller's thoughts ends up being oversimplified generalizations, such as: \u201cThere were really two kinds of readers: those who liked Little Women and those who preferred The Phantom Tollbooth.\u201d. (I mean, I did love 'Little Women', but I adored books such as 'The Phantom Tollbooth' as well. Where does that leave me in this so-called distinction?). I also found myself longing for more quotations, and perhaps the essay that Miller's constantly referring to should be put in as a part of an appendix as well.But the very loose writing style really is a strength as well. Miller writes beautifully, and her passion and adoration for the chronicles and the rich world of Narnia shines through every page. Her way of connecting and interviewing fellow Narnians such as Neil Gaiman, Philip Pullman and Susanna Clarke creates a literary rabbit hole of important influences and common interests.While Miller most certainly raises relevant and critical questions, she also reminds me of why I love the world of Narnia so much, and why I'll never forget it. With this book, Miller reminded me of the importance of stories and the way they influence us. She accuses Narnia and its creator of many things - but she also redeems him a bit, and proves why the chronicles will enchant children for many generations to come.\u201cThe world I found was inside a book, and then that world turned out to be made of even more books, each of which led to yet another world.

I thought the journey Edmund, Lucy, and Eustace had aboard the Dawn Treader was just about the coolest thing that could ever happen, and I was devastated when I finished The Last Battle and realized there wouldn't be anymore stories. I still enjoyed The Last Battle, but I wanted nothing more than for the story to continue, and I even remember asking my 5th grade teacher if it would be legal for me to continue the story!Later on, I discovered that C.S. Lewis was a Christian apologist, and that the Chronicles of Narnia contained many Christian religious symbols. I was raised Catholic, so I was dumbfounded that I had missed what now seemed so obvious. The death and resurrection of Aslan represented the death and resurrection and Jesus. How could I have missed that? I also felt a bit cheated. One of my most treasured and loved childhood memories had been turned out to be religious propaganda. I still loved the Chronicles, but they now seemed somewhat tarnished.Thankfully, the New Yorker reviewed a book by Laura Miller, entitled The Magician's Book: A Skeptic's Adventures in Narnia. The review mentioned that Miller had also loved the Chronicles growing up, had also been disappointed when she learned of the religious symbolism, but then she returned to her love of the books as an adult. I was excited and immediately headed down to the bookstore. As soon as I opened the book and saw one of my favorite passages of my favorite book (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader) quoted I knew I was in for a treat.I loved hearing Miller's story, and how closely it echoed my own. I also enjoyed her perspective on the Chronicles of Narnia. Most literary critics focus on the Christian symbolism, but Miller focuses on her own experiences and the non-Christian inspirations which are much more fascinating than another long winded explanation about men with beards in sandals. Reading Miller's book made me realize the Chronicles of Narnia are so much more than religious propaganda, and just re-reading some of my favorite passages gave me goosebumps. I was returned, for a few moments, to my childhood, when it seemed that Narnia could be waiting for me behind any door. If you are a fan of Narnia, you will not be disappointed in this well written and thought provoking book."}, {"userName": "Philip", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71601-philip", "userReview": "I went into The Magician's Book: A Skeptic's Adventures in Narnia a skeptic myself. The cover inset reads, \"... another book's casual reference to the Chronicles' Christian themes left her (Miller) feeling betrayed and alienated from the stories she had come to know and trust...finally reclaiming Narnia for the rest of us, Miller casts the Chronicles as a profoundly literary creation...\" The implication of course being that as a Christian, (a fundamentalist, evangelical Christian at that - I know,  GASP! GASP!  )I was part of \"them\" - the evil faction that commandeered Lewis's land (and even Lewis himself) for some propagandic, ulterior motive. Furthermore, Miller is cofounder of Salon.com. Every time I've visited the site it's come across as quite anti-Christian. At any rate, I went into this book wary.I was surprised. Pleased and surprised. My margins are full. This book was not marketed to the Christian demographic, but it could have been. While there are many Christian themes, symbols and metaphors in the Chronicles, there is much, MUCH more that readers miss because of their focus on their... well... Christian-ness. Of course, if the inset was changed to, \"... finally pointing out to Christians that there are many facets of Narnia that they always seem to miss, Miller has...\" I would probably still be wary of reading it.I kept a list of pages I liked versus disliked. The liked list outshot disliked 3:1. And the disliked side had some stuff that I enjoyed reading, but simply disagreed with.The book was a good look at Narnia itself, the life of Lewis, as well as some of the literary forms and devices used and borrowed in the books. Most of all though, it was a decent critique of stories in general.My only real problems were (problem 1) her characterizations of Lewis as a racist and misogynist. Although, it was fun to read, even if her arguments were weak and tired. Claiming that because he drew the Calamorenes from the Arabian Nights (the dark-skinned foreigners) he's a racist makes no more sense than saying that because the Narnian heroes are animals he's a card-carrying PETA member. Miller mentions other counter-arguments (like the White Witch being...um... white) and proceeds to ignore them.(problem 2) Book Three was really dry, and dragged. Not that there weren't good nuggets in there... there were, but when you say \"... I'm not sure how closely I would have read the first three paragraphs of this chapter, for example...\" pg. 182 you may just want to cut two of those three out.Either way, it was a worthwhile read.

I learned a lot and I think my original critique was too harsh for a promotional galley. I mean, one can only hope that the grammatical and editorial errors were corrected in future copies and the Index has more than the word \"Index\" repeated over and over again. That being said, please take my critique with a grain of salt because I don't know what was actually improved from the galley to the real deal. My main beef was that the author vacillated between making this a journey of her experience from reading the Narnia chronicles to a literary critique of Lewis' work. This work should have been, in MIller's words a journey \"through the life and thoughts of Lewis and his friends...,[author's] life and thoughts, the memories and feelings of other readers, the history and literature of Britain and of Ireland and the mythical taproots of humanity...\" What a tall order! It just never jelled well, especially when including the thoughts of random readers of the original salon.com article that spawned this work. I found the ancidotes from salon.com subscribers to be jarring. Even Miller's own past with Narnia seemed like a stretch. There was also a lot of reminiscing of lost childhood, but very few children of the age that would have appreciated the Narnia Chronicles were actually interviewed for this book. What I wanted to know, and which was never addressed, was why the Narnia Chronicles hold up so well in the modern age against competing series such as Harry Potter, Twilight, Hunger Games, etc. Is it because that we, as the older generation, venerate these books or is it because they do actually create a magical \"mythos\" that the youth of today can appreciate? These critiques aside, I thought that Miller came into fine writing form midway through the novel. I loved the comparisons and history between Tolkien and Lewis, the inspiration that Lewis drew from his motherland and countryside, and the tender love for myth-making that was imbued within the seven Narnia books. These last half of the book really made me aware of how the Narnia series laid the foundation for Miller's love of literature and fiction, but the history of these novels is what has made Miller appreciate the effort and making of the novels. Perhaps the real story is in the creation, not necessarily the fiction itself.P.s. There was also a mention of Clover's Men, Women, and Chainsaws which I took to be odd. It is as out of place as having random salon.com subscribers mentioned in your novel. I mean, if we are going this route, why not mention Susan Santog or Harold Bloom while we're at it? Then again, it is also a bonus! Woohoo for empowered \"Final Girl\" and gratuitous blood gore!"}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/803323-nancy", "userReview": "I bought a Kindle. This is the first book I've attempted to read on it. I can see that a Kindle has advantages over physical books in a couple ways: while traveling as you can compress LOTS of books into a space smaller than one paperback and if you wish a book had slightly larger print you can push a couple buttons and make it so. However, for general reading, when space or font size are not a consideration, a \"real\" book is still preferable. I checked this book out of a library. It really was a lot of fun to sit at my computer on a Friday night at my home 62 miles from the library and take out a book. However, you will notice this book is on my did-not-finish shelf.  The Magician's Book was snatched back when my time was up. As far as I can tell no e-books can be renewed. On the plus side a person avoids library fines BUT you don't have the option of paying a quarter to keep the book another day to finish it. The feature that allows you to highlight parts and to see if others have highlighted the same parts may be useful. This book had no highlights by others so I could not fully assess the feature. I did like being able to \"mark\" a passage that spoke to me in a way that would not irritate others who read the book later. I can't imagine leaving the feature on while you are reading as other people's underlines are distracting, but turning it on to mark a passage that is important to you and seeing if others felt the same could enhance the reading experience.Another drawback that may just be a matter of learning to use Kindle is that it seems totally linear. Once I knew it was going to be snatched back, I tried skimming through, thinking I might find sections to read, but that just didn't work for me. Also, this book had no index. As a sort of biography I expected one. Do any Kindle books have an index? How would it work? There are no pages, just percentages. This also means you cannot use your memory to go back to re-read a passage your remember that was on the bottom of the left hand side about a quarter of the way through the book. I missed having a physical sense of where I was in the book. Perhaps that will change if I use it more. On the book itself-- I got about 60% through it. My religious point of view is close to that of the author so I enjoyed her take as a non-religious person on Lewis's children's fiction. One point she made is that children rarely see the Christian allegory and that the books stand on their own as good stories without it. I assume she makes many more points about Lewis and Narnia in the remaining 40% of the book but I can't comment on that. I don't think I care enough to get in line to check this ebook out again."}, {"userName": "Corinne Edwards", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/875001-corinne-edwards", "userReview": "As a child in early elementary school, the author, Laura, devoured the series of children\u2019s books by C.S. Lewis called The Chronicles of Narnia. For her, they were the conduit into an entirely new realm of books and reading and, as such, hold a place not only in her literary life but also in her childhood itself. As Laura grew and discovered the barely concealed Christian messages within the books, a sense of betrayal tainted her view of the texts that had so brightly colored her childhood.In this memoir, Laura tries to make peace with Lewis and his Chronicles. It\u2019s a broad work \u2013 taking us through Lewis\u2019s childhood into his adult career. She interviewed modern authors and readers to explore their feelings on the books as well as researched the views of Lewis\u2019s contemporaries. She delves deep into the relationship between J.R.R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis and uses it as a catalyst to discuss their sometimes similar, sometimes opposing views on language, literature, myth and authorship of ideas, trying to gain a sense of the ground from which her beloved Chronicles sprang.For me, the book was both fascinating and occasionally wordy. I have read the Chronicles of Narnia, as well as other books by Lewis, and while this book did much to expand my understanding and appreciation of the books, it also painted their shortcomings with a somewhat harsh brush. Certain sections, usually the very academic and \u201cdeep\u201d ones, dragged a bit although I was interested in what I was reading. The Magician\u2019s Book reads like it was very well researched. You can tell that Miller cares deeply for her subject and does truly want to understand what makes the books so magical and life-changing for generations of readers."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8958833-molly", "userReview": "As a rule I tend to avoid most literary criticism, due mostly to the fact that it very often resides in the realm of the theoretical and academic and very far from the personal. This book is very much not that. I'm actually largely ambivalent about the Chronicles of Narnia; I read and loved The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe as a kid but just didn't feel the same affection for any of the others at the time. I only read them as an adult, understanding the (now very obvious) subtext, and their myriad flaws (elitism, casual xenophobia, SO many issues with women, all discussed at some length by Miller here) stood out like a sore thumb. I was long past the window for these books to really speak to me. But I only mention this as a testament to the fact that in order to enjoy or get something out of The Magician's Book, you don't have to have loved Narnia per se; although the book is very much about the Chronicles and Lewis in particular (and Miller clearly doesn't hold much affection for Tolkien), it reaches beyond the small lens of that subject and tries to get at the heart why we choose the books and stories we consume as children, and why those stories become so important to us in later life. For her it was Narnia; for others, Middle Earth; for me, it was Lloyd Alexander's Prydain, the alternate worlds of the His Dark Materials trilogy, and so, so many others. This is worthwhile reading for anyone who had that kind of relationship with the books they read as a kid, because Miller understands this state of mind intimately. She writes about it with a voice that appeals to both the heart of the innocent, and the mind of the experienced."}, {"userName": "karenbee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1349363-karenbee", "userReview": "When you pick up a book titled The Magician's Book: A Skeptic's Adventures in Narnia, you probably assume it will be about one person's experience with The Chronicles of Narnia. Laura Miller fulfills that expectation to some degree, but this book is balanced between being an exploration of personal responses to Narnia and a biography of C. S. Lewis.Miller talks to a good handful of people about Narnia and relates their responses; these bits are sprinkled throughout The Magician's Book. That's readable enough. It's not really what I was looking for in the book, but I still enjoyed it. In the first section of the book, Miller explains how The Chronicles shaped her view of literature, and later, how her recognition of the Christian symbolism involved reshaped her view of The Chronicles, and that's sort of what I expected. I'm glad the book was not entirely about that, though, because it wasn't as fascinating as the title made me think it would be.Where The Magician's Book makes itself worthwhile, for me, is in the half (roughly) of the book that's devoted to C. S. Lewis's life, his motives for writing The Chronicles, and his friendship with J. R. R. Tolkien. It's somewhat dry at times -- not horribly so, just enough to be noticed -- but interesting most of the time, so I sort of half-glazed over the dry parts and still ended up learning a lot. Despite my laziest intentions!Note: I had to return this to the library last month, so my recollection of where things are located in the book's layout may be a little fuzzy.(three-and-a-half stars)"}, {"userName": "Manzoid", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1372235-manzoid", "userReview": "I like reading books about reading.The author of \"The Magician's Book\" was swept away as a child, like many of us were, by the enchantment of that world beyond the wardrobe, and in fact that was her real introduction to the world of books. As a teen, however, (again like many of us) she felt betrayed and repulsed by what she then saw as ham-fisted attempts to proselytize Christianity. \"The Magician's Book\" is the story of her long journey back to appreciating The Chronicles again, on her own terms. Along the way she shares a nuanced and well-researched understanding of what made \"Jack\" Lewis tick (and he's probably not as dry as you imagine -- he regularly held big boisterous pub parties that he called \"bawdies\", for example), and of the wide-ranging intellectual and historical backdrop to his writings.There's a fair amount of interesting material in here specifically about Tolkien and his motives too. I don't know just how many geek cred points I lose here, but I actually had no idea that Lewis and Tolkien were big buds, and in fact that LOTR would never have been finished without Lewis's constant cajoling and support. They were an odd couple! And Tolkien loathed The Chronicles, by the way.The tone and presentation of \"The Magician's Book\" are a bit of a mishmash, meandering from dry lit-crit to sympathetic biographical sketch to the author's own idle musings about the nature of reading to folksy anecdotes from famous authors she'd interviewed.
