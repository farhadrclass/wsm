Better yet: The Truth About Kettle: An Autobiography by Pot. Look, I'm not going to pretend that I had any good reason to read this book. Underneath the surface, this is a scathing indictment of unfair beauty standards, the fear of female sexuality, and the entire goddamn patriarchy (and Madison, delightfully, seems blissfully unaware of the deeper implications of some of her observations about the unfairness of life at the Playboy Mansion - she's just mad that all these girls were so mean to her). But that's not why I read it. I read it because \"behind-the-scenes look at trashy reality show\" is one of my favorite memoir styles, and I've always been weirdly fascinated by mistresses, harems, harem culture, and the whole \"what men think women do when they're not around vs. what women actually do\" issue. But mostly I just wanted dirt on Hugh Hefner, the weird atmosphere of the Playboy Mansion, and the women who were paid to have sex with Hefner under the guise of \"girlfriends.\" I wanted dirt, and hoooooly shit, readers, does Holly Madison deliver the dirt. It's hilarious that the cover photo shows Madison holding a finger to her lips, because she is holding nothing back here. A more honest picture would be Madison shouting at the reader. Reading this book is sort of like sitting down for coffee with a casual acquaintance right after she's broken up with her boyfriend, and you have to sit there and listen politely while she unloads every complaint and annoyance she ever had while they were dating. In short, Holly Madison has some things to get off her chest, and god damn was I here for that. I read this book in two and a half days. So, some background: Holly Madison spent seven years living in the Playboy Mansion as one of Hugh Hefner's \"girlfriends.\" In the early years, she was one of a larger group of girls (who are always referred to by Holly's hilariously oblivious narration as \"the mean girls\"), but later the girlfriends shrank to three members: Madison, Bridgette Marquette, and Kendra Wilkinson. The women gained fame when they starred in a reality show based around the Playboy Mansion, and then eventually moved on to get their own shows once they left the mansion. Sidebar: there are a ton of The Girls Next Door episodes on YouTube right now, and there are worse ways to waste an afternoon. Madison's memoir is an incredible portrait of a total lack of self-awareness. She spends most of this book desperately trying to convince the reader that she is somehow different than all the other women who \"dated\" Hugh Hefner and posed in his magazine. See, those other girls were dumb bimbos, but not Holly! She only pretended to be dumb! The other girls were cookie-cutter blondes who all looked like clones of each other, but not Holly! Sure, she bleached her hair and got plastic surgery, but only because she wanted to fit in! It's totally different! And the other girls were opportunistic sluts who only used Hef to gain fame! Not Holly! Sure, she left the mansion and got her own reality show, and went on Dancing With the Stars, and starred in a Vegas show, but she accomplished all of that on her own! The fact that each of these projects made direct references to her history with Playboy is just a coincidence!It is stunningly absurd that, for all the time Madison spends insisting that she's built a career on her own and has completely escaped the shadow of Playboy, she can never convince the reader that she's become famous in her own right. I mean, for God's sake, the subtitle of this book makes sure to mention that Madison is \"a former Playboy bunny\" because like it or not, that is Madison's sole claim to fame. Of course, to hear Madison tell it, she was just playing the game, and was trying to get out all along. She never loved Hef, and had to pretend otherwise because it suited his cultivated image. She merely played along, Madison insists, until she was able to escape. The idea that other women may have had the exact same strategy has not occurred to Madsion, and she remains blissfully unaware of her own hypocrisy. One of the many, many bits of vengeful gossip Madison gives us is that Kendra's signature loud laugh is completely faked, and that Kendra only started doing it to distinguish herself from the other women. This, readers, is the dictionary definition of \"pretty fucking rich\" because have you ever heard Holly Madison's laugh? She just bleats \"ha ha ha ha\" in a monotone, like someone who mispronounces a word because they've only ever seen it written down.And for all her railing against \"the mean girls\" of the mansion, Holly Madison is like the most petty and passive-agressive person I've ever read about. After detailing her breakup with Vegas magician Criss Angel (Vegas. Magician. Criss. Angel.) Madison gleefully quotes, at length, all of the negative reviews his show received. I'm pretty sure that Peep Show, Madison's own Vegas show, wasn't exactly showered in positive reviews, but as far as she's concerned, it was a massive hit and everyone loved her and her lifelike, nuanced acting. And Madison makes sure we know that after she left The Girls Next Door, the show was a failure without her and was quickly canceled. When Madison's own reality show is canceled after two seasons, she explains that this was right after a new president came on at E!, who wanted to move away from Playboy-related content. The implication is that, if it wasn't for this change in management, Holly's show would still be running today. When she is accused of starting a twitter fight with Hefner's new girlfriend by claiming she stole her look (a look which, remember, Madison adopted in order to fit in with all the other bleached, surgically enhanced blondes at the Mansion), Madison is adamant that she did no such thing, and only posted a generic tweet about hating copycats. I see you, Madison. You ain't slick. And of course Holly Madison feels a personal affinity with Marilyn Monroe, unwilling patron saint of vapid starlets who want to appear complex. Here's one of the book's more rage-inducing paragraphs:\"Like me, Marilyn had suffered at the hands of some not very nice men. She was used, underappreciated, and struggled to find herself. She worked her way up in Hollywood with stars in her eyes and a kind heart, but found that Hollywood wasn't always as kind in return. She may have been publicly adored, idolized, and lusted after, but she often felt alone and trapped. Those dark demons eventually got the best of Marilyn. Part of me knows that could have easily been my fate had I not chosen to take care of myself. I only wish poor Marilyn could have done the same.\"Wow. Wooooooow. I love this paragraph, because it reveals so much more about Madison's character than she realizes. She puts herself in the same category as Marilyn Monroe, one of the most famous and most talented women of her generation, and did everyone catch the way she subtlely blames Monroe for her own suicide? Gee, if only Monroe had \"chosen\" to take care of herself, she might still be alive! If only Holly Madison had been around to show her the way!Underneath the drama and the fluff and the gossip, Madison is (perhaps unintentionally) exposing something much darker and far-reaching than a bunch of backstabbing mean girls. The real fascination of this memoir is watching Madison explore how she was brainwashed and virtually imprisoned, and how she went about the process of slowly undoing the damage she incurred at the Playboy mansion - a process that is still ongoing. Simply put, Holly Madison is a survivor of domestic abuse, although she doesn't yet have the emotional vocabulary to articulate this. You only have to read a few paragraphs about Hugh Hefner's intense control issues (he apparently hates red lipstick on women, and once screamed at Madison when she dared to wear it) and the way he pits the women against each other to realize that you're reading a description of a textbook abuser. When Madison is describing the steps she took to leave the mansion (saving money, making an escape plan), she sounds exactly like everyone who ever had to go through the process of escaping an abusive partner. It's going to be easy for reviewers to demonize Holly Madison for her choices (and as you can see from the many, many paragraphs above, it's hard not to) because, as I said in my review of Pamela Des Barres's memoir of her time as a groupie, Madison is merely a symptom of a bigger disease. The real villain of this story is not backstabbing opportunistic women, but the man who orchestrated their struggles, and encouraged fighting among them so they would forget who the real enemy was. But Madison didn't forget, and she's at her best when her writing is full of righteous fury and frustration at Hugh Hefner, the man who kept her a virtual prisoner and destroyed her self-esteem so thoroughly that she contemplated suicide. Sure, Holly Madison is awful human being, but Hefner is the Dr. Frankenstein, while Madison is merely the monster that all the villagers go after with pitchforks.In conclusion: fuck you, Hugh Hefner. You're a bad person, I'm glad your entire empire is crumbling, and I hope whatever barely-legal girl you marry next smothers you in your sleep."}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "[May 19th, 2016 (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Christie\u00abSHBBblogger\u00bb", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6650940-christie-shbbblogger", "userReview": "What can I say?

This book did that to me!So, I don't normally read biographies or nonfiction. I have, in the past, just not often. However, as soon as I heard about this book I had to read it. I won't lie, I was a viewer of the tv show, The Girls Next Door. I loved watching their bubbly personalities. I can't count how many times I giggled as something played out onscreen. Again I will be honest when I say that I thought Holly was the girlfriend that truly cared even a smidgen about Hef. So reading this was extremely eye-opening. I couldn't put it down once I started and as soon as I finished I logged online to see what other readers were feeling after reading and I was shocked!Readers (or probably just commenters) on stories across the internet are shaming Holly for the decisions she made in the past. They are shaming her for feeling the way she felt in the past and the way she feels now. And it's not right. We don't know what truly happened in that mansion. Everyone will have their own perspective on events and that's okay. Everyone will feel in their own way and again that's okay. Something my husband always tells me is, \"Don't be sorry for how you feel. It's how YOU FEEL, it can't be wrong and you can't change your reaction, your feelings, to a situation.\" And he is absolutely right, everyone reacts in their own way to words, events, and certain situations. We can't change our feelings, we can only close them off and PRETEND to feel differently. Feelings bubble up subconsciously, we don't force them unless we are acting.This book was mostly about how Holly FELT during her time in the mansion and how she FEELS now while looking back at the past. She isn't wrong for how she feels. I'm not defending her or Hef or any of the other girlfriends mentioned in the book, but I will say this: If Holly truly felt what she wrote in the book... Holly, I am happy for you now. I wish you the best.I don't wish any form of abuse on anyone, whether sexual, verbal, emotional or physical. Yes, Holly went into the relationship knowing that she was going to be \"taken care of\", but that still gives NO MAN or WOMAN the right to degrade or control you. A relationship is a mutual dance. It's give and take. It's being there for someone when they need help and having someone be there for you when you need help. It's knowing that you are loved and safe to be yourself and vice versa. What was written in this novel was not a relationship. As for those that are criticizing her because she pursued him and she knew what she was in for... Does anyone ever really see abuse coming? NO, because abusers are smart. They are charming, they hide it and they reel you in. For those criticizing her for \"biting the hand that feeds her after she made the decision to date a man old enough to be her grandfather in exchange for money\".... Have you even read the book? And have you ever made a decision that you regretted later on? Or are you a saint? As I stated above, we can't be sure what happened because we weren't there. But what we can take from this book is we shouldn't ever allow anyone to strip us of our self-worth no matter who that person is or how much we feel we owe someone. We should never settle for less than we deserve. We should always strive to reach our goals no matter who stands in our way and we should never give up.If you read this novel and didn't get that from it, you went in biased and I hope you take a second look at it with an open mind and an open heart."}, {"userName": "Ashley Brooks", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3764614-ashley-brooks", "userReview": "Here's the tl;dr version:-Feel bad for me, but don't because I'm better than everyone else.-I'm using Hef because I'm about to be homeless and god forbid I move back home like a normal person.

I was counting down the days until this audibook would be mine.It did not disappoint (more on my rating in a little bit). At the end, she acknowledges there was a a collaborator and this is the best example I can think of a collaborator's contribution for a celebrity memoir. The contribution is seamless; it sounds like Madison's voice and experiences and not a heavy-handed addition. It is polished and not painfully bad writing common with celebrity memoirs.Madison does not hold back. There are a lot of jabs thrown in this book and there are a few people who will be PISSED (or are already pissed) about the shit-talking in this book. I LOVED IT. I would've wished for more sordid bedroom details but I'm obviously a pervert.However, Madison plays the victim the entire book. Everything is everyone else's fault (Hef, the mean girls in the mansion, producers, Criss Angel etc.) and there is rarely self-reflection on how she ended up in that mess and her participation in her mistakes. I look for that self-reflection as a sign of a good memoir and I found it lacking here. That's why I knocked it down a half-star since this is a solid 4 star read.Madison does a decent job narrating. She never sounds like she's reading and she does voices. Her impersonation of Hef, though not spot on, was perfection. She tries for an English accent for the quotes from Alice in Wonderland and bless her heart for trying.If you're a fan of her or the show, I definitely recommend it."}, {"userName": "Neja", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15139865-neja", "userReview": "Well, well, well, who knew?! I know you might see this book as a silly book, but I liked it, because I felt that Holly was really honest when she wrote it.

It was light, funny, and unusual. I, like I assume most readers of this book, was curious.First of all, this book is poorly written. The amount of parentheses and exclamation marks is excessive. Sometimes thoughts are in italics, other times in quotations. The phrases \"to be honest,\" or \"honestly\" are overused. The entire book is supposed to be an honest opinion or story, so I don't understand why these phrases require such frequent use. I could go on and on about this aspect.Also, Ms Madison doesn't take much of the blame for the dissolution of any of the friendships or relationships she discusses. She often \"feels sorry\" for the people around her, then delves into a description of her low self-esteem. She has somehow combined superiority with a victim mentality. Nothing is ever her fault, she tries her hardest, and that makes her better than you.I have nothing to say about the revelations she made about the mansion, Playboy, or Mr Hefner, besides the fact that if she said it once in this book, she said it a hundred times. Everyone makes mistakes in their youth. At first, we may not seem them as big mistakes. Then they're the worst thing that's ever happened to us. Finally we figure out that the truth is somewhere in between. It seems like Ms Madison is still in that second phase. I hope that writing this book was cathartic.

Nor did I care for how she reitterated on several occasions how she wouldn't \"stoop to so & so's level,\" but had no issue airing out that person's dirty laundry as if that were \"taking the high road.\" The first 3 quarters of the book were narrated by a mean girl complaining about other mean girls and it read as trashy as if you were watching a reality tv show.The last quarter picked up when she finally moved out, escaped her abusive relationships, and really started to discover herself. Her fairy tale ending was heart warming and there were a couple important messages to young women that were unfortunately obscured by tacky drama.

I have all of the box sets accept for the last one with the new girls. Bridget and Holly my favorites but it took me awhile to get to like Kendra, she was young and annoying at the time, most of us are when we are that young :-)I loved Bridget the most because she was sweet and loved Halloween, my favorite time of the year! I loved Holly and I bought her socks she sold at the time, the freaking tube socks I kept trying to find forever. Damn, I should have took a pic of them on since I still have them :-DI always thought Hef was just a dirty old man and a lech I'm sure when he was younger, but he has what all men.. well most men.. want, all the girls money can buy. Every time I watched the show it was so much fun when the girls got to do things on their own, or have fun around the house without Hef involved. It seemed to me that a lot of times in the shots with Hef, everyone had smiles that weren't always genuine and I'm guessing if he was this strict man, I wouldn't have a smile either. I'm guessing you would have to get the multitudes of women drunk or on some kind of drugs to get them to have sex with you. Uggg, moving on, just the thought makes me sick. I thought the book was great, it took me back to the days of watching the show and I think I will have to sit down and have a marathon now. There are a lot of people that love and hate the book. I don't see anything wrong with it, I felt the same way about a lot of things that were said, but that's my opinion and I don't care what anyone else thinks ;-) I have read other books where people are in some nasty situations and everyone asked them, \"Why didn't you just leave?\" Sometimes things are not that simple. Shit just happens. I was married to a drunk/part psycho for 5 years so I really don't judge how long it takes someone to get out unless you have kids and those kids are being hurt or your animals. Just no!!! And whether I like a person or not, I'm not going to judge them when they have issues or mental problems etc. You do what you feel like you can do when you can. I loved that Mary stayed friends with Holly, well all of the girls I'm sure and I was so sad to hear of her passing from cancer. :-( She was such a nice lady. But, I'm glad that Holly found her dream, not many of us can do that. She seems to have a great husband and a daughter and a son on the way :-) Congrats.

In honesty I wasn\u2019t expecting much from this book but it was unexpectedly interesting and by the end of the book I was encouraged by her outlook on life and how she managed to weather the almost daily negativity of living in the playboy house and then turning it into a positive outcome and actually making a success for herself outside of the playboy house walls.

Yes, it has an interesting pick up in that Holly Madison is a former girlfriend of Hugh Hefner, star of the show Girls Next Door, and Playboy Playmate.However, this book isn't about the glories of bunny life. It's a book about the actuality of bunny life.You think everyone's so perfect and loves how they look? Holly points out the creepiness behind the cookie cutter image (and very low ages) that all of Hefner's girlfriends were pushed towards, and talks about the body dysmorphic issues that arise when you are living in a world where the idealization of a very particular body type and look are pushed so hard.You think life in the mansion is carefree and like a wonderful sorority? Holly talks about the strict rules (like a 9pm curfew for full fledged adults), infighting (largely incited by drama queen Hefner himself) and consistent emotional abuse from Hefner. It may seem trivial, but it truly destroys your feeling of self worth when someone does customary things like they love you and says they love, but then intimidates, bullies and controls you. Or even worse, ignores you.So why didn't Holly just leave? She's an adult, right? Holly also talks about the shitty situations some people can be in that make them think they cannot get out of their personal hell.This is an important book, and one I would readily give to anyone who is living a life they want to get out of, but doesn't think they can.

I loved The Girls Next Door. Their lives seemed so fun, so carefree. I loved all three girls, and especially Holly, who seemed genuine, classy, and had a good head on her shoulders. I felt when she left the show it was, again, a classy move on her part. She realized she was never getting children or a marriage out of the relationship and moved on. I respected that. So, it was rather surprising to see her write a tell-all book with the intention of 'telling her own story' and then spending a huge amount of time defaming her own character. Let me save you the pain and loss of brain cells and give you the rundown of what Holly Madison wants you to know. Honestly, honestly (did she mention, HONESTLY) the only reason she ever even moved in to the Playboy Mansion was that she had nowhere else to live. She treats this as if it was the ONLY solution to her problem and that she would have been homeless otherwise. Holly, you see, is never responsible for anything that happens. She is the victim of circumstance. HONESTLY. I had to stop listening to the book about halfway through, in the 5th hour of her claiming that she was in denial about her relationship with Hugh Hefner and that it was all an act. Well, I suggest someone get her Academy Award ready, because bravo to her for almost a decade of excellent 'acting'. This is a sad, sorry attempt at redemption that wasn't necessary.

What transpired was more a sad tale about domestic abuse and one woman who is clearly still struggling to mature and come to terms with what happened in her youth. I'm rather conflicted, because Holly was very clearly used and abused by Hef during her time at the mansion, and I felt deeply sorry about what happened to her. Her comments about hoarding money to help plan her escape, and the constant put downs leading to crippling self doubt mirror so many survivors tales of domestic abuse. However, at times I also feel she comes across as very abrasive and hard to like. She makes some quite catty comments about other women's intellectual abilities, and doesn't shy away from commenting on how badly her ex Criss Angel's Las Vegas show does compared to her own. I felt as someone who's been told she's worthless so many times already she might have shown more compassion for other people instead of blowing her own trumpet to the detriment of others. I can't deny I enjoyed this, although it is obviously biased to reflect Holly's take on her experiences behind the mansion gates.

But I never followed through until the end, and it looks like I wasn't missing much. By now, most of us know that even reality shows are scripted. Show creators are well aware that every audience has a preference of what they want to see, and the shows try to deliver this. What I didn't realize was how much Hugh Hefner (Hef) tried to squelch any showing of the behind-the-scenes drama which was unfolding in the lives of the three stars of the show. He wanted to create drama to feed his own fantasies, but couldn't have the world seeing anything other than his life as absolute perfection.\n\nBeing able to hold her stories over my head was just another tool Hef used to manipulate me. Watching me get upset and squirm was just another way he satisfied his perversions.\n\nI can't say that I was surprised to find out just how sleazy Hef was. I can't even say that I'm surprised by how much people idolize a man who is little more than his own creation and ego. The guy is icky - truly. Since Cosby got nailed to the wall for the pill thing, people should really take a second look at Hef. However, Down the Rabbit Hole left a sour taste in its portrayal of Holly being nothing more than the victim in all of this. Yes, it's probably true that desperate times did call for desperate measures, but since she was only willing to spill the tea on everyone else and not herself, I found that her attempt at looking humble came across as nothing but fake and self-serving to the extreme.

Don't try to sell me an entire book that tells me you were nothing but a victim. \n\nBridget and I were so square we wouldn't even have known how to get drugs.\n\nInteresting, considering how drug use was mentioned repeatedly in the book. There were (former) girlfriends and playmates who were using, and Hef was supposedly drugging his dates to get them to open their thighs. I felt like there were plenty of contradictions in this story. The biggest contradiction came from Holly's portrayal of herself being nothing but nice and a perpetual doormat.\n\nI was beyond mortified and prayed that the floor would just swallow me up. I was certain everyone on set was assuming that all three of us were equally ditsy.\n\nWas Hef a sleazebucket? I'm pretty sure he was. Were your roommates b*tches? Also, I'm pretty sure that there were no lies told here. Did you tell the whole story? I'm thinking no."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7477266-sarah", "userReview": "3.5ish stars. When I found out that Holly Madison wrote a tell-all book about her life, I knew I had to read it. I watched The Girls Next Door when I was younger and I was curious as to why these beautiful young girls would go out with a rich old dude. Of course, now I know that I underestimated just how \"desirable\" a rich person was. I was completely fascinated with the playboy bunnies and Hugh Hefners girlfriends. This book was juicy. Like really juicy! It has so many details about Hugh Hefner and life in the playboy mansion with the other girls, as well as other things like reality shows and Criss Angel. I did not know that Hugh was such an asshole and that the girls had so many strict rules that they had to adhere to, such as curfew at 9pm and no red lipstick. It really gave away a vast amount of information and it answered all my questions about life as a bunny and girlfriend. To be honest, I didn't read this for insightful knowledge about feminism from Holly and so I wasn't dissatisfied with this book. Reading other reviews on here, it's clear that some people were expecting just that and they were disappointed in this book because it didn't really give any wise lessons about feminism. I thought it was entertaining and I liked Holly. It's clear she wrote herself in a good light but I didn't mind because regardless, I like her. She got a happy ending that she wanted and so it was a good ending too. (Plus she named her child Rainbow Aurora and I love that name! I have always considered both of those names for my future babies!). I would recommend this to people who are interested in Playboy, Holly or memoirs. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u201cIt\u2019s amazing the dark places your mind can wander when you\u2019re depressed. The depths of my own depression had led me down this very dark path, and there was no gleaming light, however distant, at the end of this tunnel.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4518432-amanda", "userReview": "I religiously watched season after season of Girls Next Door, DVRing every episode as it aired. I fell in love with the charmed life presented on the reality series. Holly was always my favorite of the three stars. I followed her story onto Holly's World and desperately wished I could make it to a Peepshow performance.When I saw that she was releasing a memoir of her days at the mansion, in a way I felt like I owed it to her to read the story from her perspective. As an adult, I had come to the realization that things weren't always what the seemed behind the scenes, something I was only peripherally aware of while the show was on air.A lot of what I read here shocked me, even more resonated with me. The quest for self-discovery, self-worth, and self-esteem are issues I constantly battle. I understand all too well looking back on a situation and seeing how wrong it was, how damaging it was. Her message at the end is inspirational, but beyond that, her entire story is an inspiration of what can be overcome when you finally believe in yourself."}, {"userName": "Kristy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1150021-kristy", "userReview": "I really enjoyed listening to this. I may have seen 1 or 2 episodes of Girls Next Door ever, I have never seen an issue of Playboy, and I was always creeped out by Hugh Hefner. I heard last week that Holly Madison did not sign a non disclosure agreement and used an audible credit to preorder this. The author reads it herself and does a good job, though for some reason she takes on a slight British accent (or what is probably not even a British accent) for the Lewis Carroll quotes at the beginning of each chapter. Still, the quotes are completely appropriate for the chapter they precede. Some parts come across as defensive and I can't imagine Criss Angel is thrilled with his portrayal, but it's the author's story as she experienced it. It was an entertaining listen. Oh, and yes - based on this, Hef is as creepy and manipulative as I imagined. Gross, man. Holly - I'm glad you got out. Keep on doing you."}, {"userName": "Marla", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4021000-marla", "userReview": "Wasn't sure if I was going to like this book but I actually did. I opted for the audio version and Holly reads it herself. I always thought Hef was a disgusting man with all his girlfriends and now I he is even more disgusting to me. The man wanted to be known as a man who could concur any woman and could have any woman. He never wanted to look weak. Even though he gave his girlfriends lots of money, there were restrictions about what they could spend it on and there were tons of rules on the girlfriends that he really caused a lot of them to lose their self worth and self confidence. It was so bad that Holly started to stutter. Of course why she stayed with him for 7 years I don't know. Any man who thinks he needs to be surrounded by 3-6 girlfriends many decades younger than him is just plain creepy. I did find this a fascinating look behind-the-scenes of what really happens inside the mansion. Who knew Hef doesn't own the mansion but rents the bedrooms."}, {"userName": "Francesca", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31502192-francesca", "userReview": "I have so much respect for Holly for being brave enough to write this book. I'm aware that a few other former playmates have written about similar things and have also tried to share the truth about Hefner and I also appreciate that but Holly had the most fame and therefore her stories will reach further out and hopefully reach more girls that may need this knowledge if they find themselves in similar situations. Her memoir was incredibly honest, she owned up to her own na\u00efvet\u00e9 and mistakes and acknowledges them. I've seen some people bashing her for writing this book and saying things like 'if she didn't like it she should've left', well a) those people clearly haven't actually read this book to understand why she stuck it out and b) those people clearly have no understanding of how people get stuck in abusive relationships and, yes, verbal abuse can be just as painful and crippling as physical abuse. This book is one of those examples of people never truly knowing what goes on behind closed doors, while many of us may have had judgements or theories or thoughts about the playboy mansion, none of us actually knew what it's like there or what Hefner is like or what the girls are like. I won't lie and say that I've never had pre-judgements of people but Holly is a prime example of why I do my best not to judge people before I know them or their side of the story. This memoir is incredibly shocking (while maybe not surprising depending on what view you already have of Hefner), moving, and in the end inspirational! The last chapter is genuinely heart-warming and actually made me tear up a bit. So well done Holly, I wish her every bit of luck and happiness in her future."}, {"userName": "Ari", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1267947-ari", "userReview": "Wow, I wonder if Holly Madison has any friends left, after trashing 99% of them and anyone she has ever crossed paths with.

I fell in love with the TV show \"Girls Next Door\"- I absolutely loved all three girlfriends (Holly, Kendra, & Bridget) and I think I loved the voyeur aspect of getting a peek into a lifestyle I would never live. Life at the Playboy mansion seemed elaborate, crazy and cool. Holly narrates her audiobook (which I especially enjoyed) and while the writing came across a little self serving, she doesn't shy away from spilling the tea. She tries desperately to set herself apart from the flagship that made her relevant, and while I appreciate the desire to stand up for herself, I also recognize that you have to be grateful for the opportunities given to you. She highlighted the relationship with Hef was controlling and possessive. She also aimed fire at Kendra and some of the other Playmates involved in her time there. Special attention at the end is given to her brief relationship to Criss Angel (interesting!) and I appreciated the candidness in which she shared her stories. I enjoyed getting to know Holly's story even more and looking forward to see what else she has ahead of her."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13314714-ashley", "userReview": "I don't condone manipulative/abusive relationships. But are you kidding me?My opinion - I don't sympathize with what Holly went through when she didn't object to any of it until many years later. I really like her- she comes off as sweet and intelligent. But her actions were so frustrating.Pretty much she moved into the mansion because she needed a place to live. Um..?Her dream was to be famous and her goal living at the mansion/being with Hef was to get in the magazine. She had an agenda so I don't understand why she was surprised when she wasn't treated like a princess. I wasn't surprised to learn that life at the mansion wasn't 24/7 parties and luxury and that, gasp, the women were treated like replaceable objects. Why was Holly??Living with the most famous womanizer on the planet, are you seriously shocked he wanted to have sex with you/treated you like a dime a dozen/wasn't sincere when he said you were his one true love? She put up with that plus mean girl roommates for 7 years (while using the publicity/perks as a stepping stone to further her career) then whines that it was so bad. She often describes life at the mansion as oppressive. She was 20-27 years old with a 9pm curfew, had to ask permission for everything she wanted, and constantly had to try to get along with the other live in girlfriends. This book made me feel so suffocated.Before she moved in, she was working as a waitress and scraping by, going to college and auditions.

I liked it so much and I was curious about what a former Playboy girl would have to say. Since then, I took on watching The Girls Next Door as it is constantly mentioned in the book. The show is very amusing and quite different from what Holly Madison felt it to be.\n\"Would you like a Quaalude?\" Hef asked, leaning towards me with a bunch of large horse pills in his hands, held together by a crumpled tissue.\"No thanks,\" I answered cheerfully, as if I were interviewing for a job. \"I don't do drugs.\"\"Okay, that's good,\" he said nonchalantly. \"Usually I don't approve of drugs, but you know, in the '70s they used to call these pills 'thigh openers'.\"\nAnd that's how you know you're not in Kansas anymore. According to her bio, Holly was lured into Hef's harem by one of his girlfriends under the false pretense that they never had to sleep with the Playboy mogul. Once inside his bedroom, she went through the routine and became a girlfriend herself shortly afterwards. I need to take a moment here and thank her for not going into details because I felt filthy only reading about it.\nThat's one of the things about Hef: when it came to humiliating his girlfriends, the larger the audience, the better.\nThat, and setting the girls up one against the other seemed to be his hobbies. He enjoyed seeing the girls fight as if they were fighting over him. Because he's such a handsome and desirable man!In spite of poor writing style, I enjoyed the book.P.S. The three original girls next door were constantly reminded that they are replaceable. But after leaving the show, and being replaced, ratings dropped. I'm glad because watching the series, it is all about the girls!
