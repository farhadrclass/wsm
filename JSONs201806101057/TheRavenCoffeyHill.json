Mike Nappa is the real deal when it comes to Christian-penned suspense thrillers that pack a punch without vomiting expletives and/or getting overly gruesome. His novels can certainly hold their own against secular titles of equivalent force and dynamics. This second installment in the Coffey & Hill Series is every bit as good as the first: Annabel Lee - and then some! Nappa is truly hitting his stride and honing his craft. The few niggles I had with Annabel are no longer an issue in the Raven. All the way around, I loved LOVED loved everything about The Raven. Mafia Dons - Arms Dealers - Vendettas - Kidnapping - ATL - Eccentric Southern Nuances - Old Scars and Bitter Regrets - all laced with Coffey and Hills vetting wit and humor, with hints of underscoring faith. It's an A+++++ excellent read! Keep them coming, Mike Nappa. The reading world needs more quality, clean written, thrilling suspense fiction. I can't wait for Book Three!!!

At first I thought I was going to be disappointed, and then I reached chapter seven, and I was hooked. I love the way Nappa takes seemingly disconnected details and pulls them all together into a satisfying ending. I also appreciate the way he is unafraid to tackle events and themes often avoided in Christian literature, but handles them in a way that does not sensationalize them.  When Trudi Coffey first sees, deception specialist, The Raven, he\u2019s in a tight spot. The Raven becomes enamored with this beautiful lady who saves his life, but little did either of them know the trajectory their relationship would take from there. They also had no idea how the men who had placed him in that tight spot would figure so prominently in their future. These men certainly weren\u2019t done with the Raven, and weren\u2019t to be frightened away by Trudi.  Samuel Hill, Trudi\u2019s ex, has made mistakes, big ones, but he still loves Trudi, and will go to any extent to protect her, whether she feels like she needs to be protected or not. Is his trust placed in the right people to assist him in this endeavor? Only time will tell. Has bringing Trudi in on his Nevermore investigation placed her in greater danger? Well, neither one of them is backing down now. While they may not be able to resume their relationship, Trudi and Samuel\u2019s love will be Forevermore. Then there is Mama Bliss, matriarch of Little Five Points in Atlanta, Georgia. There is much more to that sweet, elderly lady sitting in her wheelchair painting outside the store, Sister Bliss\u2019s Secret Stash, that she opened with her late husband, William, than meets the eye. Much more. Mama Bliss is the character in this story that will grab the reader\u2019s attention and hold it firmly until the end, driving the reader to put off other things that need to be accomplished in order to uncover the truth behind Mama Bliss. I highly recommend Mike Nappa\u2019s Coffey and Hill series. While The Raven would work fine as a stand-alone read, the reader who has first read Annabel Lee will have greater insights into the characters\u2019 motivations and relationships, and will understand the occasional reference to their previous case.

I was blown away by his first book in the series, Annabel Lee, and so I was curious to see if this relatively new-to-me author would again be able to capture my attention with his follow-up book. And boy, did he ever! The Raven was simply riveting, from beginning to end. I was held captive by the entertaining plot equally as much as by the fascinating characters. The Raven is unlike any character I've encountered before, and I couldn't help but like the guy for all of his thieving ways. And just wait until you meet Mama Bliss! I wasn't sure whether I liked her or not, and in the end I think it was a little of both. Nappa has succeeded at raising reader's sympathies for the \"good\" and the \"bad\" until you realize that perhaps we are all a bit of each, saved but for the grace of God. Those readers who encountered Trudy and Samuel (the Coffee & Hill investigators) in Annabel Lee will greatly enjoy reconnecting with these characters again in this novel, and while it is not strictly necessary to have read Annabel Lee, I would recommend doing so just for the joy of journeying with them from start to finish. Their relationship is a complex one, with a difficult past and deep hurts all mixed up with a love that won't seem to let either of them go. As such, their story is one that you want to see more of, and of course things aren't perfectly resolved in this second novel regarding what their future holds. As I came to the close of \"The Raven\" and got a glimpse of the adventure that is to come, I can only imagine what lies in store for these two!Mike Nappa has once again crafted a clever story that I am certain to return to in the future. His books are the kind that you simply must devour in one sitting, and I am looking forward to the third book in the series. If it's anything like these first two installments, we are in for a treat indeed.

Sadly, I never got the chance to read it, but I quickly jumped at the opportunity to read The Raven. Though I knew both of these titles were taken from Poe's works, I sadly didn't realize that they were part of the same series about the same people--a thoughtless oversight on my part! Luckily, this did not hinder my understanding of The Raven's plot, although I do wish I had read the previous book, as there was a lot of underlying tension between characters that made me wish for the background knowledge Annabel Lee would have given me.I have mixed feelings on this book. It took me a few chapters to get into- it has a \"southern-fiction-ish\" feel that I wasn't really expecting, and as that style of writing is not my favorite, I felt disappointed. Also, though this book would still probably be considered clean, it was a little rough around the edges, so to speak. That being said, it definitely grew on me the more I read. I love husband-and-wife detective teams, but I'd never read about an ex-husband-and-wife detective team. Coffey and Hill's relationship is an interesting one, although I felt like I didn't get to know either of their characters as well as I would have wished. Honestly, I really can't decided whether or not I liked this book. It had a lot of characters (though they certainly weren't hard to keep track of) which were all layered with murky and tangled motivations. The geeky pop-culture references were appreciated, and of course anyone with an affinity for Edgar Allan Poe's works will find the premise intriguing. Perhaps I will try Annabel Lee and see what I think of that one before I fully commit to an \"aye\" or \"nay\" on this series.I received this book for free from the publisher in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Yo Leo Ficci\u00f3n Cristiana", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37540605-yo-leo-ficci-n-cristiana", "userReview": "RESE\u00d1A COMPLETA EN ESPA\u00d1OL\nThis series gets better every time.This book is a new case of private detectives Trudi Coffey and Samuel Hill.

I enjoyed reading this novel even more than I did its predecessor, Annabel Lee. Either book could be read as a standalone, but I recommend starting Mike Nappa\u2019s Coffey and Hill series at the beginning if you haven\u2019t already, as the characters grow and develop from one book to the next.Recurring characters Trudi and Samuel continue to work through their personal issues, while they team up to solve another case. I felt these characters were more sympathetic than in the last book, maybe because they weren\u2019t as hard on each other? Anyway, I do like the direction they seem to be headed, and hope to meet them again in a future installment of this series.The lead character for this book, besides Trudi and Samuel, is The Raven, a street magician calling himself a deception specialist, whose attempt to blackmail someone lands him in a heap of trouble and smack dab in the thick of something bigger than he would\u2019ve imagined. He\u2019s not your typical lead for a Christian fiction novel, but his cool-headed and somewhat sarcastic analysis of even the most traumatic situations can be quite entertaining. And despite his many flaws, he also manages to be quite sympathetic, and I won\u2019t give details away, but I like where the storyline takes his character arc by the end of the book.Highly recommended if you enjoy a good mystery, and don\u2019t mind witnessing some violence along the way.Specific to the Audio Edition:Romy Nordlinger\u2019s excellent narration does justice to the story, with character voices and storytelling that immerse the reader into the thick of what\u2019s happening. Whether she\u2019s portraying a thug with an accent, or the sarcastically laid back analysis of The Raven, her narration fits just right, and is fun to listen to.I borrowed this audiobook from my local library via Hoopla.

While I haven't read book #1, Annabel Lee, this book was a great read as a stand alone, but I'm betting had I read book #1, I would have had a little more of the back story on the characters in this book.This one was an interesting read..... let me share just a bit about the key players. Private investigators Trudi Coffey and Samuel Hill must scramble to sort out the clues - and their complicated feelings for each other - to rescue The Raven and save hundreds of lives. It is clear that these two investigators were included it the first novel - they are divorced from each other, but running a detective agency together. The chemistry between the two of them make a great addition to the story.Mama Bliss is a 70+ year old woman who is the matriarch of Little Five Points in Atlanta, Georgia. She appears as though she is a sweet, elderly lady sitting in her wheelchair painting outside the store, Sister Bliss\u2019s Secret Stash, that she opened with her late husband, William. She is grieving the loss of her grandson and she wants revenge. Enter \"The Raven\" - a twenty-something guy who is a street magician - a deception specialist - earning a living by entertaining people using \"slight of hand\" tricks. The Raven sometimes picks pockets sometimes to pay his rent and ends up stealing the wallet of a powerful city councilman. Due to the politician's extra curricular activities and ties with the Ukrainian Mafia, the Raven learns what it means to feel real pain and he ends up with life changing consequences. When he tries to blackmail a councilman, he finds himself in the middle of a wild and very dangerous plot called \u2018Nevermore\u2019.The Raven has elements of suspense, drama, mafia, dirty political dealings, revenge, and more. There is nothing predictable about this story, and it unfolds in a way that causes you to piece together the big picture as you are going along. I definitely recommend this book - it's a little rougher than my normal read - but overall, a great story that keeps you turning pages until the end. I will be heading out to find book #1 in this series to catch all the back story for myself in the event there's a book #3!I was provided with a complimentary copy of this book from Revell a division of Baker Publishing Group for my honest review and was not required to give a positive review."}, {"userName": "Brandi (Rambles of a SAHM)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10154315-brandi-rambles-of-a-sahm", "userReview": "As soon as I finished Annabel Lee I began to eagerly anticipate the next book in the Coffey & Hill series. Mike Nappa's writing style is very compelling. I found myself caught up in all the action and unable to put the book down.The follow-up novel, The Raven, is even better than the first. Once again Mr. Nappa uses a clever rendering of one of Edgar Allen Poe's famous works. This time the main character is a street performer that goes by the name of The Raven. This character is one that you will grow to like and find yourself cheering for even as he makes bad choice after bad choice. There's just something about him that makes you want better for him.Another interesting character is Mama Bliss. She's a very beloved fixture in her Atlanta neighborhood. Everyone knows Mama and Mama knows everyone and everything going on in the neighborhood. I really liked her, even when the story started opening up and we find out some questionable things about her, I still liked her. Then there's Trudy and Samuel, aka Coffey & Hill Investigations. I know there is so much in their past that it seems they will never be a couple again . . . but oh I want them to be! The sparks that fly when they are anywhere near each other make for a fast-paced story. Trudy is spunky and Samuel is suave, which should mix like oil and water but there's an emulsifier from their past relationship that just keeps blending them together.If you enjoy a suspenseful read that has clever overtones and sizzling undercurrents of romance then this is your book.

The Raven, mama Bliss, Trudi, Samuel, all of them aren\u2019t stereotypes. They are so described that I saw them literally before my eyes while reading, I sympathized and felt compassionated with them all. Also the whole surroundings experience of walking around in the American Atlanta state, with the different neighborhoods and within the different cultures, by reading is amazing. If you ask me a very marvelous piece of writing style. I have to admit though that I personally think that \u2018Annabel Lee\u2019 had a more powerful start, with more speed in it through the whole story. \u2018The Raven\u2019 took a bit longer to get hold on me.

Hierdoor bood hij mij zijn nieuwe thriller \u2018The Raven\u2019 (tevens het tweede deel in de Coffey & Hill series) aan om te lezen en te recenseren. Waarop ik uiteraard ja zei en gelijk begon met lezen.In dit tweede deel krijgt het detective duo Trudi Coffey en Samuel Hill te maken met een nogal aparte straatartiest genaamd The Raven. Deze jongen is nogal goed in zakkenrollen tijdens zijn optredens en brengt zich dusdanig in de problemen door precies van de verkeerde te jatten. Hoe komt hij terecht via het chanteren van, wie hij denkt, een simpele maar rijke zakenman tot diep aan zijn nek in de Oekra\u00efense maffia? En hoe komt hij hier in hemelsnaam uit? Kunnen Coffey & Hill hem helpen en wat betekend \u2018Nevermore\u2019? De karakters in dit verhaal zijn net als in het eerste deel uitgesproken types. The Raven, mama Bliss, Trudi, Samuel, allemaal niet stereotypes. Zij worden zo beschreven dat ik ze letterlijk voor mij zag tijdens het lezen, met hen mee leefde en mee kon voelen. Ook het hele omgevingsgevoel van rondlopen in het Amerikaanse Atlanta, in de verschillende buurten met daarin hun verschillende culturen, spat van het papier. Zonder dat het in langdradige gedetailleerde bewoording beschreven is. Oftewel een knap staaltje schrijfwerk als je het mij vraagt. Wel moet ik toegeven dat ik \u2018Annabel Lee\u2019 iets vlotter op gang vond komen en het bij \u2018The Raven\u2019 wat langer duurder voordat het boek mij volledig in zijn greep had.

An old woman knowing more that she shows. Pain and (maybe) forgiveness. The perfect ingredients for thrilling and smart ride. This is a second book in the Coffey & Hill Series, but can be read as a standalone novel (but you dont wan't to miss the goodness the first novel Annabel Lee is!).I love this series. It is smart and sleek and I would even call it \"sexy\" - but not in any lascivious/carnal way or anything physical even, it is just very attractive in its capabilities and wit! Take Trudi Coffey and Sam Hill. They have all the charm of any TV golden couple, can fight and kick as if they are paid for that (and they are :)) and their sparks would heat Antarctica. But there is more about any of them - and this is what is important. Under all the swift hits and witty remarks is a lot of pain - they once were a marital couple, until the betrayal. And they still love each other, but Trudi can not trust Sam anymore. And this personal pain and (I so much hope so) slow way to healing is what brings some nourishing food for thought on the table. Or take The Raven. A smart, playful boy with painful past, changing his ways because of a good woman (clich\u00e9, I know - but also well-hidden dream if the hearts of most women). I have such a soft spot in my heart for him. He deserves all that and more. And Mama Bliss, living with pain because of the death of her grandson? He story is probably the most painful of all of them, because of the lack of hope. And forgiveness. I love how Mr Nappa gets women - which is not common trait among the male writers. But I felt recognized as a woman during my reading these novels. And I need me some Vince Camuto boots!My only complaint is that i would love to hear Sam Hill's voice. He needs to do that or he will stay just a nice sidekick to Trudi, whose voice is known, which would be a pity.

This author writes some great characters that are fully capable of making the reader want to see them get what they deserve, for the good or the bad. If you like the kind of novel that never takes a rest, this will be a perfect read for you. Even during the portions of this book where the characters are being thoughtful and trying to figure out their next move, there is always something happening. This novel is complex enough to keep even the busiest and most demanding reader satisfied. This is a series that can make you forget your worries and focus on something else for a while, and isn't that a main reason why we read anyway? recommended.

I highly recommend picking up the first book and continuing with the second. The characters are well fleshed out and developed through the two books. The plot threads are still present and active. The writing is clean and well edited making the read enjoyable. As with the first, there is no preaching or heavy Christian theology, just a really good clean read.

Mike Nappa definitely knows how to spin a good yarn, not to mention create unique and complex characters. This book is full of them, but only three provide their point-of-view: The Raven, Bliss Monroe (Mama Bliss), and Trudi Coffey.The Raven is such complex character! He\u2019s very entertaining \u2013 quite droll, even in some of his most dire moments \u2013 but also a bit of a lost boy, with a story that provided some surprisingly deep and poignant moments in the novel. In fact, there were a few times I got a little watery-eyed on his behalf, one of which was an incredibly powerful and well-written scene. It was impossible not to like him, as most of the characters in this novel discovered at some point (even his \u2018enemies\u2019), but neither is he without his faults. I mean, for starters, he\u2019s a \u2018deception specialist\u2019...Then there\u2019s Mama Bliss \u2013 or Mama, as she is often known: a seventy-one year old diabetic who mostly gets around in a wheelchair. She owns Sister Bliss\u2019s Secret Stash, a ten-thousand-square-foot superstore of unique and unusual items imported from all over the world: Movie memorabilia, stage costumes, antiques, first editions, one-of-a-kinds, and anything out of the ordinary. But there\u2019s more going on behind those doors than most people realise, and like The Raven, she also has a tragic story to tell. Trudi Coffey is the PI who works at Coffey & Hill, the firm she and her now-ex-husband, Samuel Hill, began. Now there\u2019s a complicated relationship! They were, of course, introduced in Annabel Lee, but even if you haven\u2019t read that novel, you\u2019ll pick up enough of their story in this one that you won\u2019t be lost. I have to say, I didn\u2019t find Trudi\u2019s attitude as grating as I did in the previous one; although I\u2019m still not fond of her constantly referring to Samuel as \u2018my ex-husband\u2019 (which seems to have taken the place of his name even in her thoughts). Maybe I\u2019m just getting more of a handle on her personality, but I think she\u2019s also softening a little.Now, as for the plot. Phwooaaaarrrrrrr! Like I said, Mike Nappa knows how to tell a ripping yarn. He hooked me from the beginning with an opening scene that ends up being a glimpse at the novel\u2019s climax \u2013 the type of glimpse that has you on the edge of your seat, but manages to avoid giving any spoilers. We learn that \u201cNevermore\u201d is imminent and it\u2019s about to get really messy\u2013And then we jump back in time four weeks and the story begins. There is nothing predictable about this story, but it unfolds in a way that has you piecing the big picture together as you go along. Once you do have the big picture, though, the tension continues to mount as you brace for the impact without having a clue how it\u2019s all going to pan out.It\u2019s definitely a thriller, but I did think some of the narrative could have been more concise at times. That was the one thing that occasionally slowed things down for me, but I still have no hesitation in giving this one five stars.Oh, and while this is not a cliff-hanger (everything from this story is resolved) be prepared for an ending that will leave you itching for the next in the series...I received a complimentary copy of this novel from the publisher in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8276796-becky", "userReview": "Quoth the Raven....PLEASE READ THIS ON MY BLOG: http://bookreadingtic.com/2016/09/23/... THANK YOU! The Raven makes a deadly decision the day he decides to blackmail a local politician with information he has learned from picking pockets. His actions set into motion his involvement with some of the most dangerous people in Atlanta. The Raven is a hustler, a young man in his early twenties, who supports himself by picking the pockets of his audience while he performs street magic. The target of his blackmail has many ties to gangs, the underworld and the Ukrainian Mafia. Instead of getting money, Raven gets three men determined to do him lots of harm. Trudi Coffey breaks up his first meeting with the thugs, and it is love at first sight for Raven when she rescues him.Private investigator Trudi is more interested in her case than Raven. She and her former husband, Samuel Hill, now a policeman, are trying to solve a complicated investigation. They have uncovered a secret plot called Nevermore. Their work is really cut out for them with the many references to Edgar Allen Poe that keep popping up. An arrested gang member offered a small amount of information when trying to make a deal. But he didn't offer anything concrete.Things are fast spinning out of control for The Raven when he comes under the protection of an elderly woman, known as Mama Bliss, who has lots of secrets of her own. Despite her advanced age, she has lots of power with people who count. Just when life looks like it has calmed down for Raven, things really start to explode, possibly literally.Because of his name, is The Raven part of the Nevermore plot? Will The Raven do the right thing, or get away when he has the chance? Can Trudi and Sam ever put the past behind them, or will Trudi give the smitten Raven a chance?This fast moving thriller has lots of memorable characters, that are believable. Mama Bliss and The Raven have complicated stories, and the author gives great insight into what makes them tick. This is the second installment in the Coffey & Hill Series, and the story stands on it's own. The author does a good job catching the reader up on former story lines. Once this volume is picked up, it is hard to put down. The story draws you in, and you are off on a wild ride to find out the secret of Nevermore. The punishment the thugs dish out to The Raven, is harsh, however, it is not an unexpected result from involvement with such dangerous people. The surprise character that attempts to help Trudi in the hotel is both fun, and faith supporting! This highly talented author will leave you saying, \"Wow!\" I recommend this five plus star book to anyone who likes exciting, well-written thrillers.Revell Publishing has provided bookreadingtic with a complimentary copy of The Raven, for the purpose of review.

He is now a detective with the Atlanta PD and has arrested a gang member who mentions a nebulous nefarious event known as Nevermore. The gangbanger knows nothing more, but Samuel feels compelled to investigate what could be a potential terrorist threat to Atlanta. He makes contact with an old acquaintance, Mama Bliss, who knows everything about a portion of the city as well as keeps many secrets. He asks her to put out feelers about this Nevermore plot. After a few days, she tells him it must be a hoax as everyone she has asked has never heard of it. Samuel and Trudi both feel in their guts that there is something more going on, but are stymied on how to proceed.Meanwhile, Trudi has a new admirer, The Raven. He is a street magician; make that deception specialist, who picks pockets sometimes to pay his rent. He steals the wallet of a powerful politician and learns what it means to feel real pain. He thinks Trudi is gorgeous, but she thinks he is too young for her. She tries to advise him to get help from Samuel, but that doesn\u2019t happen. The Raven stumbles across Nevermore, discovers what it is and how it is to be carried out.After reading the first novel in this series, Annabel Lee, and absolutely loving it, I was eager to read book two. However, this second book didn\u2019t live up to my expectations. There wasn\u2019t near the action in book two that there was in book one. Trudi and Samuel are almost afterthoughts; their mystery solving skills aren\u2019t really shown. There is some slight mention of faith in regards to Trudi, but Samuel claims to be an agnostic. I hope in future books in this series the faith avenue is explored more. I did like the development in the relationship between Trudi and Samuel. Overall, I just didn\u2019t get connected to this story. I do plan to continue reading the series as sometimes a particular book just doesn\u2019t fit a particular reader at certain time in his/her life. I\u2019m eager to read book three in the series as this author does write well.
