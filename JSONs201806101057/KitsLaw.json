The writing is so good, the storyline is mesmerizing and the action rarely lets go. Morrissey has a talent for developing fully rounded characters and her descriptions bring the small Newfoundland coastal town to life. I was a bit nervous about reading this one as the blurbs on the cover made it sound so grim and disturbing, but I found that although Kit lives a tough life, and things rarely work out for her, she does have allies and people who love her and are there for her. This is a novel that will stick with me. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Mary Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7349067-mary-anne", "userReview": "A wonderful first novel that gives us the savour of small town life with the generosity, hypocrisy, callous gossip, and cohesion that such a small town provides.

Isolated from the rest of the village due to her mother and under constant fear that she will be taken away from her family and placed in an orphanage, Kit maintains a quiet mouse-like persona. Taking whatever people throw at her in silence. She goes through life essentially as a ghost.Lizzy: An old lady with much fortitude. This lady has guts, gun, and a voice to match them all. Never to be brushed aside or told what to do, Lizzy is the bad ass grandma that values family no matter how estranged it is. Taking the responsibility to raising Kit while keeping an eye on Josie, she instills lessons onto Kit and tells her that this place will always be her home.Josie A fiery red headed women with a mind of a child. We don't know exactly what the problem with Josie is other then the fact that she is literally a child stuck in the body of a grownup. Hence, her actions, words, and behaviour is all like the way a child acts. This is a fact that Kit is neither able to understand nor work with.The SettingTaking place in a small fishing village in Newfoundland, this is the story of the fight 3 women (soon to become 2) have to make in order to assert their right to live life as they see fit. To take control of their fate and not rest it upon \"God's Law\". This was a book filled with drama (ironic for such a small village) and has multiple plot lines going at once. It's fun and entertaining for sure but it has some issues. There are so many subplots going on and some start to overtake the main story line. By the end of the book, you couldn't even tell that we were going to end up here. That's not to say that the book was unpredictable. On the contrary, I found it to be very predictable. But rather, what was delivered was not what was expected. The tale of a teen girl forming a bond with her mother was there but became heavily overshadowed by the amount of drama going on. Drama caused by wait for it........LOVE.Oh but this is not your typical love story. No sir indeed. This is one that takes a (predictable) twist and really questions how far a person can take their life into their hands until it becomes morally questionable. Honestly, there were 2 issues I had with this book.The first was that it was too fast paced. The writing while hooking was very rushed and time went by incredibly quickly. For example, we are mourning the death of Lizzy for a couple of pages only to be told on the next page right after that an entire year passed. AN ENTIRE YEAR. Character relationships while nice, progressed at too quick of a rate. What you could take for a couple of days were actually months in their world.The second issue was that this book tried to be one of those books that presents some deep fodder to chew on. But it tried so hard it was obvious and in combination with the fast pace, it ended up falling flat on it's face. It didn't hinder the reading experience but there were eye rolls and exasperated sighs when those moments came.In the end, if you liked Little House on the Prairie but want a version with some darker themes, then read this book. Don't expect a masterpiece but something fun to take you mind out of the world for a bit."}, {"userName": "Mj", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5706631-mj", "userReview": "Kit\u2019s Law by Donna Morrissey is a very moving novel. It is both heart wrenching and gut wrenching. And be forewarned that while there are light moments and joy throughout, the plot includes a lot of sadness and describes a great deal of pain and suffering caused by the selfish and uncaring acts of a few.Morrissey shows us the good and bad in small seaport communities - the shunning and ostracizing, the bullying and making fun of - actions seen by children in all communities, big or small. In this town, there are also adults being mean to an innocent child, to a woman with challenges, and to an old woman who loves and cares for the innocent child and the woman with challenges. Judgmental standards and intolerance for differences from the perceived norm motivate their meanness. There are also secrets behind these persecutions and ongoing attempts to use the church and God\u2019s supposed wishes to break up the trio. There are also many generous people in the community. There\u2019s local Doctor Hodgins who cares for patients at all hours of the day or evening and who is particularly close and helpful to this all-female household of Lizzie (aka Nan,) Josie and Kit. A local fisherman named Old Joe is Lizzie\u2019s card playing partner and often helps out with a fresh catch and a smile. After Nan dies, and Josie and Kit are on their own, more people step up to help. Auntie Drucie is a sweetie who checks in regularly and helps with household chores. Others drop off food, mend or make new clothes and send other necessities. Sid, a schoolmate of Kit\u2019s takes care of chopping wood and keeping the woodpile full after Josie, traumatized by Lizzie\u2019s death, is no longer able can to continue with this chore. It\u2019s a small community with a myriad of interesting citizens that Morrissey has created. She well describes the traits and idiosyncrasies of each and keeps us interested by detailing all their various connections and interactions.There were lots of tears and crying in this novel. Kit is the innocent child, who is stoic and has been tear-free most of her life, despite her experiences of isolation and harassment from others her age. For the first time, when she is just about to turn thirteen, she starts shedding a few tears and letting things out that she has held inside previously. The reason - her grandmother or loving Nan dies. Lizzie is the old woman many in the community dislike and who has effectively raised Kit as her own daughter on behalf of her challenged daughter who is incapable of living on her own, never mind bringing up a youngster. Kit\u2019s thoughts on Page 54 \u2018Tears swelled in my eyes and I felt Doctor Hodgins sit down besides me as great wrenching sobs heaved out of my chest. And if it weren\u2019t for his hands holding onto my shoulders, I believe I would\u2019ve sobbed my soul into heaven that day, leaving behind a sack of skin and bones as dry as the skin coating Nan\u2019s feet.\u2019At the age of sixteen, just over three years later, with a lot of heartache in between, Kit is pretty well cried out. On Page 382 there\u2019s another sharing with Doctor Hodgins. \u2018My voice caught and I laid my cheek on Doctor Hodgin\u2019s shoulder, breathing deeply of his warm, familiar smell, allowing the few tears I had left to seep down my face. \u201cI don\u2019t know where all the water comes from,\u201d I sobbed, \u201cI\u2019ve cried so much.\u201dMorrissey\u2019s character development is excellent. I really liked Lizzie (Kit\u2019s grandmother who Kit calls Nan). She was a strong and fierce woman, outspoken and a straight shooter and at times a bit of a curmudgeon who defends her daughter and granddaughter to others no matter what, while also loving each unconditionally and raising them with rules, chores and love for others in their hearts. I wish she had not passed away so soon. By Page 54 her physical body was no longer in the story - only her spirit and the results of her parenting and other good works. I hope Morrissey reads reviews and Nan might be featured in her own book one day.I am not a Newfoundlander, so read with my praises with some reservation, especially those of who are from Newfoundland and are more knowledgeable about these things. My viewpoint is from an outsider looking in. I thought Morrissey\u2019s use of dialogue was terrific and she seemed to accurately capture the phrasing and local idiosyncrasies of Newfoundlanders. I thought she reflected well the lyricism and lilting found in the Big Island people\u2019s speech and that Morrissey\u2019s imitation of the accents and local slang was spot on.It is hard to describe the emotional trip that Morrissey took me on. From the first page, it was an emotional roller coaster and page-turner. I was so immersed in the characters, the meanness and story line; I was exhausted whenever I stopped reading. And yet\u2026.I didn\u2019t want to put the book down. I was fully invested in wanting to see good win over evil and seeing mean people get their come-uppance, that I could not stop reading. There was a short time at about page 250 when I started finding things a bit sluggish and was feeling a bit of \u201cbeen there, read that.\u201d However, it did not last too long. I thought the last 75 pages and the book\u2019s wrap up was one of the more satisfactory conclusions to a book I have recently read. Predictable? Both yes and no but the key was it felt very authentic. It totally got me into Kit\u2019s head, soul, emotions and character. I felt as if I was there in person with Kit to the point that I had to put the book down before continuing with the last chapter. The tension and seriousness of what was ahead felt overwhelming and foreboding. Reading the book was an emotionally draining experience for me. Morrissey had me that invested and engaged in the outcome.4 1/2 stars due to the slight slowdown. So\u2026so\u2026close to a perfect 5 stars read. With Goodreads marking scheme rather than being able to give a score of 9 out of 10, or 6 out of 7, I will be rounding down to 4 stars. It\u2019s a tough, emotional but rewarding read. The read was both gut and heart wrenching as mentioned earlier but well worth it - a wonderful book captures the spirit of Newfoundland\u2019s geography. The oftentimes-harsh ocean dominates and shapes all who live there. This same toughness is in the spirit of the key characters in Kit\u2019s Law - strong to the core, fierce in love and loyal to the end. Kit turns out to be very much like her Nan, who would have been so proud to see her all grown up.The writing was exceptional. Here\u2019s one more example. On Page 311 there\u2019s a thought by Kit after observing her good friend and terrific wife and mother Loret, in the midst of the chaos and activity of many of her children running around amongst adults who are swearing and fighting. \u2018All this flowed past Loret like an irksome summer\u2019s rain that drenched you to the skin, while bathing you its softness.\u2019The balance between character development (people and locale) and plot or story line was exceptional. It is not often that one has a chance to read such a moving novel and at the same time read a well-written literary page-turner. Well worth reading. 4 1/2 stars rounded down to 4 stars\u2026.but only because it was so, so slightly shy of perfection."}, {"userName": "Emmkay", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7135572-emmkay", "userReview": "A real page-turner, this is a coming-of-age story about a teenage girl living in a small Newfoundland outport community in the 1950s with her indomitable grandmother and her developmentally delayed mother.

It was a breeze to get through, though I felt like 1950's Newfoundland sounded a little bit like Little House on the Prairie, so maybe the newfies are a bit behind on the times. I would like to have heard more about Josie's story, as it was her struggle that interested me more than Kit's did. The characters are simple and a little bit cliche, but it felt like a getaway story depsite the bleak outcomes of mcuh of it. This was the first two thirds of the book. Then came the twist. It all fel apart after that. I burned through the rest as quickly as I could as it left a bad taste in my mouth. I wanted to move on to a new book and forget about this one. Kit felt like a wholly different character in this section, and Josie was more or less forgotten.

I found Morrissey's writing to be very engaging and lyrical as she vividly describes Newfoundland and its culture, unique dialect and small coastal town feel.But it was an interesting premise regarding Kit's living situation and that kept me reading. Kit, Josie and Grandma Lizzie's characters were well thought out and felt very believable. So believable that there were a few times when I got frustrated with what Kit had to deal with on a daily basis with her mom, Josie. It was a lot to bear for a teen and I could feel her frustration as well as her strong devotion to her family.There are a fair number of secondary characters as we see what life is like in the small coastal village of Haire's Hollow. I only wish the reader got to learn more about these unique characters - some of which, if I'm being honest, were just a tad too clich\u00e9d for my tastes. It would have been great if the 'bad guy' had some redeeming quality or have a look into why the resident 'mean girl' is so mean (she reminded me a lot of the spoiled Nelly Oleson from Little House on the Prairie fame, an image I couldn't shake throughout the book).There was one scene that had me nail biting/on the edge of my seat but unfortunately I saw the major plot twist from a mile away. Even after I figured it out I was hoping for a red herring but that unfortunately never happened. It was still a solid read but I would have loved to have had just one more twist. After the plot twist was revealed the book felt a little jumbled and out of sorts with the ending being the weakest part of the book.Overall, this was an enjoyable read with a wonderfully eastern Canadian feel to it. The characters and location added a truly unique spin to the book. I look forward to reading more from this author.My Rating: 3.5/5 stars*** This book review, as well as many more, can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca)."}, {"userName": "\u2740 Susan G", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7820199-susan-g", "userReview": "https://ayearofbooksblog.com/2017/09/...Desolate, devastating and resilient are words that describe both the struggling characters and the rough terrain of Newfoundland of Kit\u2019s Law. This strong writing remains with the reader long after the book is closed with a reader puzzling how other members of the small town could treat a family so poorly. I have to admit that the first couple of chapters were a bit slow but once I got into the story, it was hard to put the book down!The novel is the story of Kit, a young girl living with her feisty grandmother and her \u201cwild\u201d yet intellectually challenged mother. They live in a remote outport and fight for their independence from the nasty local pastor who preaches against them and has led the fight to have Kit placed in an orphanage. This book is has strong characters that are described so that the reader has strong emotional reactions to them. The reader admires the feisty independence of Kit yet cringes at the descriptions of some of the men.I had been lucky to meet Donna Morrissey who was born in Newfoundland. She was engaging and enthusiastic while keeping the audience laughing! This was her first novel which began as a short story and lengthened into a book as she wrote at her mother\u2019s bedside. Her mother argued against happy endings and sadly, her mother died before the evening before it was accepted by the publisher.This is a great novel and I am looking forward to reading more books by Donna Morrissey including Sylvanus Now which is the first in a series leading to The Fortunate Brother which is the book that I have signed."}, {"userName": "Janet Berkman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4057836-janet-berkman", "userReview": "What a lovely piece of writing.

Yes, I liked Kit, a lot, and there were parts that interested me, that confounded me, that surprised me. But mostly, I was disappointed, cautious, confused, confounded, and at times, surprised at the narrative, the relationships that sprung out of nowhere and were cardboard (the Godfather's Cove family, for instance). And I expected someone else to arrive, and I don't know how long it's been or what has really changed. I'm nervous, unsure, confused. But it ENDS as it begins, with a view from outside into the cabin. Nice framing. \"IF YOU WERE TO PERCH ATOP A TREE on Fox Point and look down, you would see a thin layer of ice glazing the gully's brook as it suckles its way down to the seashore. Flanking the gully's sides are withered mats of timothy grass, struck down by a sudden frost and scented with a brew of wet ground, burning birch and fresh-cut sawdust. To the side of the weather-beaten shack squat on the hillside besides the gully is a towering woodpile of fresh-sawed logs. And standing next to the woodpile is Josie, grunting loudly, her long red hair streaming across her face as she swings an axe into a birch junk resting sideways on the chopping block.And if you were to hop onto a windowsill and look inside the house, you would see me, Kit, my fine yellow hair tucked back into a hairnet, humming softly as I check the lids on a row of preserving jars, still wet with steam and a pink froth bubbling a quarter of an inch above the red berries inside. A sharp whistle cuts through the air and I run to the window, shielding my eyes from the sun as I look up over the bank to the road. A man with a thick, woolly beard gracing his chin treads slowly down over the bank. Josie drops the axe and stares. The man watches her, then lifts a piece of birch rind, taut between his forefingers and thumbs, to his lips and pierces the air with another ear-splitting whistle. Josie barks out a crazy laugh and charges towards him. Lifting back her fist, she reams it into his belly, and bounds down over the gully laughing wildly. He staggers after her, half-bent over, clutching his stomach, a grimace distorting his face.He straightens up as I step off the stoop and start walking towards him, my arms held out before me.

This is only my second book by this author, having read Downhill Chance a couple of weeks ago. This was the author's first novel. It rang with authenticity and her use of words to paint beautiful pictures of Newfoundland's wilderness was simply amazing. I loved the characters in this book, and my heart broke for Kit so many times, I just wanted to hug her. It was an easier read than Downhill Chance; I'm thinking the author's voice has become more sophisticated with time and I had to read more carefully and slowly at times to catch the nuances of the wording in DC. I preferred Kits Law for its simplicity, perhaps a testament to my lack of sophistication in translating Newfoundlandish.

Most I have read..and am on a roll to read them all in order of 'year written'.Thankx Donna Morrissey.One of the many great quotes from Kit's Law...\"You'll be next, young martle, if you goes puttin' on airs around here......She might be a tramp, but she's better than them that made her so, for it's a damn sight easier to clean the rot off a crotch than the shame off a dirtied soul. Think about that before you starts hangin' your head.......\""}, {"userName": "Brianna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45174078-brianna", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book, but it wasn't anything extraordinary. The language in this novel was a little bit difficult to follow at times because it used some Newfoundland slang, but once I got used to it, it was pretty easy to follow. The storyline was a nice coming-of-age story that I enjoyed. One major downfall, however, was the gaps in the storyline. The timeline jumped all over the place, even within paragraphs, which made for confusion at times. Overall, I did enjoy it, and I would recommend it for anyone who likes a little bit of romance, and little bit of adventure and a whole lot of drama."}, {"userName": "Colleen Hymers", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18866301-colleen-hymers", "userReview": "I love me some Newfoundland writers - they can tell a story like no other. And Morrissey is no exception. Hard to believe that this is a first novel, it is so well written. Morrissey's words lift off the page in a lyrical fashion, and her characters and the coast they inhabit, are vibrant and rich. And there's some grit to it too (Morrissey doesn't shy away from violence) which is always welcome because it keeps the story from becoming drippy with sentiment (which sometimes happens with stories set in rural Canada), and lends it authenticity. A couple of plot developments kept this one from being a full five star read (for me), but I've become a fan of Morrissey, and I'm looking forward to reading more of her work!"}], "description": "Kit's Law is the passionate, well-told story of three feisty female characters struggling against imposed order and male tradition in a harsh Newfoundland outport. Lizzy is the steadfast grandmother; crazy, red-haired Josie, the mother; and Kit, the 14-year-old daughter who tells their story. Like a maritime cutter, the narrative sails along smoothly, and much of the dialogue is in the distinctive argot of that windy Atlantic island: \"When it's clear like ice and ribbed on the bottom--that's the killin' frost. Your berries are dead. Good for moose and caribou pickin's. Now, there's them that picks 'em anyway, and that's why their jam is as tart as a whore's arse.\"  With its partridgeberry patches, moose stew, and endless cups of tea, this is quintessential Newfoundland. After Lizzy dies, the nasty local pastor wants to put Kit in an orphanage and Josie in an appropriate institution. The compassionate Doctor Hodgins becomes their staunch defender against both do-gooders and those plotting Kit's downfall. This first novel is a female coming-of-age story of the rural variety, replete with endemic poverty, good-hearted and downright evil village people, and the constant irritant of Newfoundland's raw, nasty weather. It is also the touching story of Kit's first love, and it reads like a breeze. --Mark Frutkin", "title": "Kit's Law", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/511342.Kit_s_Law", "average": 3.98, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1423845559l/511342.jpg", "reviews": 150, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/284466.Donna_Morrissey", "name": "Donna Morrissey"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/511342.Kit_s_Law", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/907368.Kit_s_Law", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8511495-kit-s-law", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/907366.Kit_s_Law", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/821280.Sylvanus_Now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/821284.Downhill_Chance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14743204-the-deception-of-livvy-higgs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6744441-the-fortunate-brother", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2820138-what-they-wanted"]}
