The short stories all have something to do with baseball because Ray Kinsella(the Author)is famous for writing books about baseball. In one of the short stories, Reports Concerning the Death of the Seattle Albatross, has a character named Mike Street who is a mascott for the Seattle Mariners. At the beginning of the story, he all of a sudden retires after being the mascott for five years. Then it goes back to show how his retirement happpens. When he got the job for the mascot, he found out that if people found out who he was he would be fired because he had to stay in character. During the season, Mike dances around and entertains the crowd which makes him really popular. At the end of one of the games, a girl named Virginia meets him and she wants to go out with him. He takes her to to the top of the stadium where he lives. While this is happening, he still has his costume on. When she finds out that he lives up there, she becomes fightened and she backs up slowly. She then falls off the the railing to her death. When the Police find out, they question Mike to get the story. When they ask him to take off his costume, he refuses and the FBI have to restle him to the ground. He yells and screams because he doesn't want to be seen. At the end of the story he ends up going to a isolation cell on a military base.I thought the book was pretty good and that it had some decent stories. There were a few that were quite boring but there were some that were good, like the one I wrote about. I think I liked this book more than the last Kinsella book just because the stories were broken up and I could follow them better. In the Last book, the story went all over the place and I couldn't really follow it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes short stories or who likes baseball. I gave this book a three out of five because it wasn't the greatest but some stories were interesting and funny.In this quote, Mike flys Virginia toward the roof of the Kingdome. \"How did you do that?\" Virginia squealed. \"It's all done with mirrors,\" I said.In this quote, some of the FBI agents are making fun of Mike, \"I've been keeping somethinf from you all these years. I'm really the Seattle Albatross.\" The three of them smile their charming smiles. \"Thats quite a confession, Tony,\" says Jean. \"I suppose it's rather like getting an albatross off your neck.\"In this quote, People are starting to find out that Mike has retired. \"Albatross fies the coop\" was how the headline of the PostIntelligencer sports section read.\""}, {"userName": "Brody", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1534680-brody", "userReview": "This book was really fun to read I thought at first each of the stories would interconnect, however as i quickly discovered they didnt. This was a really fun book to read each story ended really openly so it left a lot of room for your imagination to run free and make up your own continuation of the story. Things that may concern some is the language it was a bit \"racey\" however making the characters talk any other way would take away from the context and make it less enjoyable to read. Another thing that I enjoyed about the book was the mention of vancouver, one of the stories takes place there, it made the book a little more personal which was great. Overall a good book for those who like baseball and even for those who just love a good story i would recommend it"}, {"userName": "Pablo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/196704-pablo", "userReview": "Kinsella is, for obvious reasons, thought of as a \"baseball writer.\" But as I'm sure has been said before, he's a talented writer regardless of genre. In many of his stories a sort-of magical realism is prevalent, along with other aspects of \"literary fiction.\" With regard to his presentation of characters and story development he reminds, in a lot of ways, of the early Stephen King novels that first got me into reading, up to about Misery. (Everything after that pretty much sucked IMO.)"}, {"userName": "Derek", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8557464-derek", "userReview": "\"Distances\": Not magical realism, just realistic but told from the perspective of a child, so with an air of wonder.
