It was THAT good. My insides felt like they would rip apart and I wanted to scream and cry. And THAT is what makes a GREAT book. This book had me emotionally charged, to say the least.It is the 1930's. We meet Lilly. She is a young girl kept locked in the attic by her parents - for her own good, they believe. The reason? \"God forgot to give me color,\" says the little girl. My heart broke at this remark. Nowadays being an albino is not a big deal, but back in the 1930's.. you were considered a freak..a monster..or as Lilly's mother told her..an abomination. In the middle of the night, her mother told her that she had a surprise for her. That she was going to let her out of the attic AND take her to a private viewing of the circus that came to town. She took her by the hand and led her out into the night into the middle of the forest. A man met them. This man worked for a freak show and the girl's mother sold her to him..And this was the life she was given..This story impacted me in a profound way. And I do feel it necessary to warn that there are upsetting themes in this novel. As a huge advocate for the humane treatment of animals I was deeply saddened by the gross maltreatment of animals in this book. This book centered around a circus and a freak show. The treatment of the animals in the circus was very cruel and inhumane and upsetting. With that being said, it was also an accurate portrayal of the time period. I think the author did some amazing research and I felt almost like I was there..transported into that era. I think that is a truly remarkable gift for an author to have the ability to transport their reader anywhere in the world. That is the gift of reading, after all. And this book, reminded me over and over again..why it is I am so passionate about reading.I received this book from the publishers in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Ellen Wiseman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5683897-ellen-wiseman", "userReview": "I hope everyone will add this book to their TBR pile! :)"}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "I've said before that I'm fascinated by what it is that prompts an author to write a story and I appreciate that Wiseman in an interview at the end of the novel tells us how idea for the story came about. \" ...the idea started with the image of an old camera hidden inside a mansion. Then I imagined a little girl locked in the attic, which probably stemmed from my love of Flowers in the Attic and my fascination with stories about people hiding their \"less than perfect\" children in a back bedroom.\" This is hard to read from the beginning seeing ten year old Lilly's treatment by her horrible mother as her father stood by and let it happen. It isn't until Lilly is sold to the circus and pent up in cage that we learn why her mother thinks she is a monster. From a side show attraction in a circus in the 1930's, Lilly becomes a fake medium and ultimately an elephant rider, finds love and tragedy. In an alternating narrative, twenty years later, we're introduced to Julia who also suffered at the hands of her horrible mother, a religious zealot and weak father who may love his daughters but does nothing to help them as he hides behind his liquor bottle. She runs away, but returns to her childhood home and horse farm after her parents are dead. The question becomes how will Julia and Lilly's stories cross? At some point the reader knows what Julia doesn't and her search to understand the things she finds in the attic became a little tedious. Some tough issues are covered - child abuse, animal abuse and this makes for a tough read, but if you've read any of Wiseman's books, you know she never shies away from some awful things that happened in history. The fact that an incident involving an elephant is based on a true story illustrates Wiseman's look to historical fact. There are side shows, freak shows depicting the awful treatment of deformed or disabled, either fake or real. The story moves from sad to sadder to omg - how much more? I don't know a lot about the circus life and what it may have been like, but I just felt that especially towards the end when we learn about Lilly's fate that it was just a little too melodramatic so it's 3.5 stars but not quite 4 for me . I have read all of Wiseman's novels so it is hard for me not to compare them. My favorite is What She Left Behind and I will continue to read what Wiseman writes hoping that I will be as captivated as I was with that one . While I gave this 3 stars (3.5 if I could) I did like it , just not as much as a couple of her other books. If you are considering this, you should definitely read all of the 4 and 5 star reviews as it appears I'm an outlier here.

Please be advised that the few items quoted below may change in the final published copy, but needed to be included in order for me to leave a meaningful review. Since I only read the first half of the book, I'm not really sure if anything below can be considered a spoiler, but there are some references below to people and events that occur throughout the first half. Read on at the risk of learning that all your assumptions about how the plot develops are actually correct.)I have not read anything so awful in years. I forced myself through the first half, intending to finish regardless, but I just couldn't. The scene with the zebras, followed by the completely predictable and trite love scene in the water, was the last straw. Having satisfactorily finished reading \"What She Left Behind\", I can only guess that the author turned over writing duties on this one to her 12-year-old nephew. First off, why use a passive voice in the title? Very odd. Secondly, a very heavy reliance on \"the questioning mind\" construct really turned me off. (\"What was it? And why had her father hidden it in his dresser? \" Or, \"What was she supposed to do now? And what about the horses? Were they okay? Would Claude show up to take care of them? Most of the horses would be fine..., but what about Blue and her baby? Could they take this cold?\") I actually have enough intellect to figure out where an author is leading me without needing it to be spelled out for me as part of the narrative. This happened at least every few pages, and was just draining. And the characters - so Glory keeps telling Lilly how \"everything will be ok\", and she'll protect her from Merrick. Well, as of the halfway point, Glory has done absolutely nothing to protect Lilly. Nothing. Merrick (and the townies) have completely abused Lilly, and Glory has never stopped it. Oh! And Lilly takes a whipping from Merrick with a riding crop where each blow was harder than the last, but IT NEVER BREAKS THE SKIN?!!! Give me a friggin' break! Also, again as of the halfway point, we have yet to be told why Lilly frequently has this inability to breathe (does she have asthma? Does she suffer from panic attacks?), that she can get through just be telling herself to. The same with her counting - is she OCD? ADD? Autistic? Why is she counting things all the time? With no other symptoms of any mental disorder. And Julia - what a complete overnight turnaround for a runaway to just slide into the role of Mistress of the Manor! How fortuitous that she's so comfortable with the horses.Oh! And let's not forget to refer to EVERY SINGLE CIRCUS CHARACTER by his or her first name and description every time they're referenced. (eg: Hester the Monkey Girl and Magnus the World's Ugliest Man). At some point (certainly after the first several months with the circus), it seems that Lilly and others would no longer need the longer appellation in order to know who they're referring to; Hester and Magnus would probably do the trick. I could go on about the many ways in which this book fails, from outsized and over-the-top characters (momma, Merrick) to trite and predictable plot lines (the elephant boy), to 5th-grade sentence structure and development, to overused constructs, and beyond. This was just awful AW. FUL. I will actively steer folks away from this title, if possible. I'm embarrassed for everyone who contributed to the production of this novel."}, {"userName": "Susan Peterson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10178397-susan-peterson", "userReview": "The Life She Was Given is a riveting, heart-wrenching story, a book unlike anything I've ever read!!

She was hidden away in an attic for ten years and then sold to a circus by a cruel and heartless mother. Lilly is an albino and in the circus she becomes part of the freak show which is run by another heartless soul, Merrick. Making friends among the \"freaks\", Lily grows into womanhood seemingly escaping one form of captivity for another. She meets and falls in love with the young elephant trainer Cole, and they marry and have a child. Sadly tragedy strikes again and Lily's life is thrown into turmoil and grief.Years later we meet Julia another Blackworth woman who struggles with not knowing who she is. Through bits and fragments she learns of Lily, the cruelties of the Blackworth family, and secrets that will affect her in many ways. I have never been a fan of circus stories. However this book created an atmosphere of sadness and mystery surrounding these two woman and the lack of love in their lives.

It had received some great reviews from my Goodreads friends and so I thought I\u2019d give it a go.The novel is told from two points of view. We first meet Lilly, in the early 1930\u2019s. who is a little girl living locked in an attic for 10 years with nothing known of the outside world except what she reads in books and the little that she can see out of her window. She was told over and over throughout her life that she was an abomination, that if anyone saw her they would be frightened of her and maybe do her harm. \u201cLilly didn\u2019t know what an abomination was, but is sounded bad. Her shoulders dropped and she sighed in the stillness of her room\u201d. She never had a mirror in her room but only saw a vague image of herself when it was dark outside and she saw her reflection in the window of her small room. Her mother is a religious fanatic who thinks that Lilly\u2019s \u201ccondition\u201d is her punishment for wishing so desperately for a child that she would sell her soul to the devil. Her father is a spineless man who does nothing to help Lilly, he instead escapes into alcohol.When Lilly is age 10 the circus comes to town and her mother does what is almost incredible to believe, she sells her daughter to the circus. It is finally here that Lilly understands about her \u201ccondition\u201d and makes friends and enemies among the circus people. Her story is a wonder to read and I kept wanting to get back to her story when I was reading Julia\u2019s chapters.We then meet Julia who is an 18 year old living in the early 1950\u2019s. She ran away from a suffocating home environment when she was very young and is now struggling to make a life, working in a diner and living with an abusive boyfriend. She is astonished when a knock at the door brings her the news that her estranged parents have left their entire estate, Blackwood Manor, that home that she fled, to her, along with all of their assets, it is quite a fortune. She isn\u2019t sure if she wants to return but feels that it has to be better than her current situation.She finds that she has not only inherited Blackwood Manor but a family mystery which she is determined to solve. Through a lot of sleuthing and discovery Julia finds out the truth about the sister whom she was told had died and all of the astonishing things that had transpired while she was growing up and living in the same house. \u201cShe went into the dormer and tried to look out. She imagined a little girl, her sister, standing where she stood, looking out and wondering what else lay beyond this grimy window. Goose bumps rose on her arms. The longer she was in the room, the more nauseous she felt. Maybe there weren\u2019t rats in the attic after all. Maybe it was her sister all along, making the noises in the ceilings and walls. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up.\u201dI found the writing to be very good, descriptive and rich in verse describing some incredible people. Some so self involved and evil they are hard to comprehend and others so kind, forgiving and loving that they make the world shine. The history of Blackwood Manor makes for a very interesting read and I don\u2019t think that you will be disappointed. The fact that some of the book is based on actual fact makes the story so much more incredible.

I felt my heartstrings pulled as I read about the harrowing tale of Lilly being locked in a room and her mother selling her to the circus. And then in alternating chapters we\u2019re introduced to Julia set a least 20 years apart from Lilly. We know that Julia was anxious to escape the strict and cold environment she grew up in and distances herself from her family. Then one day at work in a diner she receives unexpected news that turns her life inside out. A very descriptive portrayal of the cruel yet pseudo family life of the circus. I was emotionally drawn to Lilly when her childhood was taken away from her by first being locked in the attic and then sold to the circus as a young girl. The circus is a hard life yet it offered her friendships and we saw her grow and stand up for herself when she refused to lie to benefit the circus. The owners didn\u2019t offer her one ounce of respect and treated her as their property. She then catches the attention of an elephant trainer with the gentle way she had with animals. Her life in the circus turns from being a side show to the main attraction.Julia\u2019s story is one shrouded in mystery. Slowly the layers start peeling away as I turned the pages faster. Usually when there are two narratives I favor one more than the other, but here I was equally invested in knowing the outcome.

The paragraph says, in more or less layman\u2019s terms: \u201cAlbinism in humans is a congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes. Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as photophobia, nystagmus, and amblyopia. Lack of skin pigmentation makes for more susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancers.\u201dI know this because I went and googled the word albinism, and saw what came out. I don\u2019t know when the author began research on her book The Life She Was Given, but, if it had been any time in the last fifteen years, this information would have been more or less equally readily available to her as well.If she\u2019d actually bothered to open and read the very first link in her search (hint: it\u2019s Wikipedia) she, like the readers of this review, would have discovered a few no-doubt surprising facts about albinism. For instance, she would have been astonished to find out that there are several kinds of albinism, of which the most recognizable emblematic form \u2013 it\u2019s called Type I, just so you know \u2013 is the most famous, although not the most common. The most common type of albinism, type II \u2013 I know, scientists are so original \u2013 numerically outweighs the first type around the world, and, while still having many of the albino features, is basically unknown, because type II albinos\u2026 well, they don\u2019t really look albinos. Yours truly, for instance, a type II albino with credentials, has dark blonde hair. My eyebrows could stand some pencil, and my skin looks like Ye Olde Albinoe, but go prove it to the disbelieving public.All types of albinism, however, have one thing in common, and that thing can be gleaned even from the paragraph that Google Search displays, without opening and bothering to actually, you know, read about it: severe vision defects. So if you make your character a perfect albino doll (of course she\u2019s a perfect albino doll), maybe, just maybe, you should give her the visual acuity of 20/200 she\u2019s supposed to have, just for the sake of being original. The information is, after all, right there. This is spoilers, by the way. We spend the first three chapters or so in a state of uncertainty and tension the author builds up for us. We\u2019re supposed to wonder, you see, how horrible and abominable this child is that her parents imprisoned her in the attic, only to discover later that \u2013 poof! \u2013 there\u2019s nothing wrong with her! It doesn\u2019t work, because from about page 2 we very quickly garner the impression of the parents being such utter, insane bastards that we as readers fully expect the \u2018horrible birth defect of doom\u2019 to be a mole on the shoulder or a couple of crooked teeth.I grant, of course, that I may gripe about this too much because, as a type II albino with actual visual acuity problems, I find my utter lack of representation in fiction in any kind of realistic way to be, well, annoying. It might be better if albinos were not represented at all, but as they serve as the convenient go-to monster with whom nothing discernable is actually wrong, I would be ever so grateful if the authors had bothered, at least for the sake of courtesy, to explore the condition they want to portray. And there\u2019s literally nothing wrong with this girl aside from the colouring. I mean, she\u2019s actually perfect. Porcelain doll perfect. The amount of times her flawless skin is mentioned would make any normal woman erupt in pimples. I\u2019d go back and literally count it, but I don\u2019t think I can stand the pain. Her beauty is elaborated on, expanded on, noted by the basically-omniscient narrator. It\u2019s very important for us the readers to understand how astonishingly beautiful this albino woman is. I suppose it\u2019s important to stress since it is one of only virtues; her job in this story is to be tormented, abused, protected, shuffled, cheated, saved, stared at, taken care of, stood up for\u2026Basically, she gets all the personality and treatment of the porcelain doll she\u2019s described as being. She started and ended her life in the same attic, a prisoner, she got pushed and prodded from plot element to plot element, and her moment of happiness came as a result of being saved by, and married to, her sole Knight in Shining Armour Protector, who presumably loved her because of her personality, but we can\u2019t tell.No, I\u2019m serious. Our heroine has not done a single active thing for herself until the last three chapters of the book. Everything she got and whatever happiness she managed to eke out was a direct result of her boyfriend standing up for her.In the last chapters she threw herself head over heels into a stupid cause trying to rescue an elephant that killed a human because it had to (sounds familiar?) and gets herself wounded, her husband killed, and her young daughter orphaned. Smart. Compassionate. Good job.Also, she has superpowers. No, seriously, she has Wild Empathy. After having interacted for her entire life with one cat she can make animals do everything for her without a word and without any training. All animals, from the moment she sees them. I suppose there is a reason for her to be able to do something like that with elephants whom she petted and made friendly with for years and years \u2013 although how she would achieve new commands without a single bit of training I\u2019m hard pressed to figure out \u2013 but she can do it with animals she\u2019s never encountered before, too. It\u2019s because of the purity of her heart, which is obviously embodied in the purity of her whiteness, or something.At least our second heroine, Julia, is a little more active. In fact, too active for a woman on her own in the 1950s. Julia acts, speaks and is reacted to like a woman in the 2000s. she swears (actually says \u2018Shit\u2019, if you please, which I\u2019m sure makes total sense for a woman in the \u201850s), becomes the owner of a business and horse ranch, runs around in men\u2019s sweaters and pants, and nobody so much as blinks. The only way we get to know this is, in fact, the 1950s is via a thousand tiny descriptive details the author bothers to provide in the form of brand names and the mention of poodle skirts.Julia is less of a Purity Sue than Lilly who is literally an angel walking the earth, but even she has some of the same trends. Her own empathy with animals is less supernatural, of course, and she occasionally stoops to actual shoplifting in order to eat. She also ran away from home. Presumably these more normal attributes are because she\u2019s not an albino. You have to be a real albino to get animals to obey you instinctively. I wish my cats knew that.Julia\u2019s plot involves a lot less straight-up endless suffering, a lot more horses, but no less boredom. Who would have thought that constant unending abuse, and descriptions of nothing but abuse, could actually be boring? But with the heroine of one timeline doing nothing but be beaten up and the heroine of another timeline doing not much the pacing of the plot, which requires time skips of six years, stands still and refuses to move.In the end, this is a story of passivity. Maybe on purpose \u2013 I almost hope so. Passivity of the two female protagonists, passivity of the men (the few, approximately three in the entire story) who are not abusive, passivity of society, and who all knows what else. Certainly the main protagonist, Lilly, is embodied by being more or less a lifeless thing. It is extremely telling, to me, that even the title of this book is in the passive voice; The Life She Was Given and not, say, The Life She Had. Maybe one day we will finally step out of the realm of passive disabled beautiful flawless pure people to whom things happen, maybe one day\u2026 but it is not this day."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2059440-maureen", "userReview": "I've read every novel Ellen Marie Wiseman has written, and although they were all wonderful, none touched me quite like The Life She Was Given.

All the time Lilly was locked up in the attic, hidden away from the outside world, her mother told her she was a monster and an abomination. Her mother was a religious fanatic and kept Bibles in Lilly\u2019s tiny attic room and made her pray and read scripture devoutly. It\u2019s hard to say if her mother was always this way with religion, or if she became that way after Lily was born, it doesn\u2019t really say in the book, i\u2019m guessing maybe after the birth of Lily, because, after having eight miscarriages, her mother vowed to sell her soul to the devil for a baby, and after Lilly was born with her condition, her mother believed it was because of the deal she made with the devil.

A private investigator shows up to the diner one night with a letter, informing Julia that she has inherited her childhood home, the home that she ran away from two years prior, is now hers. Her mother has passed and left the Blackwood Manor to her. Arriving at the creepy and possibly haunted manor, she discovers a disturbing secret that she is determined to get to the bottom of. From here bombshell after bombshell is dropped, right to the very last page. A few times I actually gasped and whispered \u201coh my gosh.\u201dI enjoyed this book immensely, this story has stuck in my mind, it really had an impact on me. The author really did a wonderful job with her research of that time period, and took some actual true events from history and weaved them into this unique skin crawling story. Knowing that a lot of the story was inspired by actual events makes this story that much more gripping. I saved this book to read at the end of my day, which for me is when I save the best books to read, it is the quietest and the time when everyone is unwinding themselves or already in bed. This is my me time. Unfortunately, this is when i\u2019m in my bed, before going to sleep. Unfortunate because this book was too good to put down and two nights in a row I stayed up all night reading.

She is articulate and carries a story very well. She takes the time to lay her characters out and explain their importance. Her books are diversified and well researched. She is easily becoming one of my favorite authors.This particular book deals with loss, loneliness and acceptance. It starts out with a forlorn child being sold into the world of a traveling circus in the early 1930's. Then, by alternate chapters, it moves to the 1950's and a young girl inheriting a horse farm. I thought that the first few chapters were a bit slow, as it laid the story out, but once past that, the novel bloomed into a book that I did not want to put down. There was only one part of the book that I had a problem with and it pertains to an instance of animal cruelty. That was extremely hard to read and was heart wrenching.

I've been on a circus kick. So due to a specific challenge, I picked this book to read. I was a little hesitant to dive into it but still went into it at the same time?? If that makes sense??The Life She Was Given was pretty good for a circus themed kind of book. This book was filled with interesting characters who had pretty unique stories. Lilly, who is about 10 years old, lives in the attic. She doesn't know much about the outside world, other than what she sees outside of her window. She was also told over and over again how little her worth was and that she was an abomination. Of course, Lilly doesn't truly understand the meaning of these words spat at her but she knows that they aren't good. Lilly was so lovable and it hurt me to see how she was treated. She had no idea what she looked like and basically lived with horrible people her whole life. I hated both of her parents because they were terrible people. Her father was a drunk and her mother basically called her the spawn of Satan and treated her worse. I hope hell has a special place for those two. One day the circus comes and Lilly can finally see the light! Or her mother?? Since she's the one who sold her daughter to the circus. SOLD HER PEOPLE. Again, I hated this woman with a god damn passion.Then there's Julia, who is about 18 years old, and ran away from home. Of course from this life-changing decision, she is now living a struggling life and working at a diner. However, that's not all. She also has an abusive boyfriend. Again, I'm feeling so bad for both of these girls and how their lives are. One day Julia finds out that she was left a mystery manor, called Blackwood Manor, from a mysterious family member. Along with the house and land, well.. it's filled with a ton my mysteries. This house was filled with stories and ghosts - but mostly ghosts. While digging around the house, she found out information about her sister. A sister that she was told died. The two storylines, and timelines, intertwined in such a creepy - yet really good way. I loved all the goosebumps and chills I got while reading. The history of the house, Julie, and Lilly was amazing to read and I fell in love with everything. Both girls were in rough situations and their stories definitely made me go through an emotional roller coaster. Overall, I loved this book. I will definitely going to look into another book by this author."}, {"userName": "Cindy Burnett", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2445617-cindy-burnett", "userReview": "3.5-4 starsThe Life She Was Given is one of the saddest books that I have read in a long while. The book is beautifully written, but I had a hard time reading portions of it because the story line is so depressing. The Life She Was Given is written in a dual timeline format. Lilly\u2019s story takes place mainly in the 1930\u2019s, and Julia lives in the 1950\u2019s. Having children of my own, I found it so disheartening to read about the parents that raised Lilly and Julia. With respect to Lilly, I do not want to spoil the story so I will simply say that I had hoped for a different ending for her. She encountered way more than her fair share of cruel people in her lifetime. I liked the story involving Julia a lot better and was pleased with the resolution of her story. I was very glad to read this book because I had heard so many good things about it, but it very much weighed heavy on my heart.

At ten years old, she is told by her mother that her appearance scares others and thus, its safer for her to stay hidden. All that changes one fateful night when Lilly is told to don her best dress and then taken to the circus. There her mother meets with a strange man, money is exchanged and Lilly is left behind in the custody of said man. Fastforward a few years, Julia Blackwood is moving back to her childhood home. Unknown to her, its a home that harbors many unsettling secrets.Wiseman does not dissapoint. Having read all of her previous work, I gotta say, this is the best so far. This work reminded me a lot of Sara Gruen's 'Water for Elephants'. There is a circus background (and all the hardships that entails), a female elephant protagonist and even the covers of the books are similar. But the course the narrative takes is quite different. Lilly is told that she is different, an abomination. She does not discover what exactly is \"wrong\" with her until she is sold to the circus by her mother. As Lilly attempts to settle into her new life, she experiences both elation and hardship. Julia was a teen runaway, but because of dire circumstances agrees to go back to the house where she was not very happy. This is a narrative about dark family secrets. The dual storyline (Lilly and Julia) worked very well. The prose is beautifully written, heartwrenching and sad. While the novel deals with difficult subject matters, Wiseman handles those with finesse. While this is not a feel good book, its one with heart. Looking forward to Wiseman's next book."}, {"userName": "Rhonda Ruff", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40134064-rhonda-ruff", "userReview": "Such a heartbreaking story!

We have two settings and POVs here. One from a girl in the 1930's and another from a girl in the 1950's. Both are connected to the same house; but the mystery of how, why, etc. is of course a good chunk of the plot of the book. SettingYou can't go wrong with a creepy old house that has areas boarded up and secret rooms. And alternatively the circus is a great place to tell the story of a 'freak' or 'unnatural' (as she is called in the books) girl. Between these two settings I was hooked from the first chapter. The rich circus setting is not over done or exaggerated at all. As for the house; I can't say much or I'll give too much away. Just now that it's a bit creepy and hides secrets well. The 30's  As always, the primary story I loved was the older one set (largely) at the circus with our 10-year-old girl. The start of our story is a 10-year-old girl who is trapped in an attic and never let out by her parents because she is a 'freak'. I won't give away what makes her a 'freak' because I think it's an interesting reveal.Relevant to the start of this story is actually a tidbit from the acknowledgements where author Ellen Marie Wiseman indicates that Flowers in the Attic by V.C. Andrews was a part of the inspiration for the past story. Certainly she nailed it on that aspect. I read Flowers in the Attic when I was a teen (and like Wiseman) I was very struck by it and immediately upon reading the first chapter of The Life She Was Given it was my first thought. Kudos to Wiseman for taking the trapped in the attic element and making it her own story from there. The 50'sOur lead gal in the 50's timeline is a down on her luck gal who definitely could use some direction and purpose in life. This portion of the story is maybe 25% of the whole story; but is (of course) relevant to the reveal at the end of the book. I think there was just enough of this time period without it becoming monotonous or overdone. The reality is that we all want to read about the circus more than we want to read about breeding race horses. That's just basic human curiosity for most. Writing ToneOf all the things that were lovely about The Life She Was Given, certainly the tone, flow and voice of the stories was most striking. Wiseman has a writing style I love. One that compels you to turn the page, but also captures that 'old' feel. Almost like you are watching an old movie of someone's life that has the stains on the edges, and is maybe a bit worn. I'm not sure how else to explain it but this is the kind of historical fiction writing I love. Where we feel immersed in the past and the small details (like the value of leather or silk) is emphasized in order to remind us that they didn't use go to a mall to buy things. I am definitely interesting in reading all of Wiseman's books now just to read more of her writing style. OverallIf you like historical fiction I think you are destined to like this. Interestingly it sets just before WWII and just after. I found this choice to be quite clever by Wiseman and at no time did I feel like she forgot the war because during the narrative it's clear lots of things are happening in the world. However it's not necessarily relevant to our the very focused story here. Overall I adored this book. Characters were all very enjoyable, romance was lovely (not over done) and the settings were the icing on the cake. Definitely one I will be purchasing for my personal print library!!For this and more of my reviews please visit my blog at: Epic ReadingPlease note: I received an eARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley.

It is the story of two girls: Lily, aged 9 who has been kept locked in her parents' attic since she was born around 1922 with a deformity that her mother determined was an \"abomination\", (it wasn't) and about 20 years later, Julia, aged 19, a runaway, who has just inherited her parents' estate and horse farm, so she returns to the home she hated. The story starts with Lily's mother finally leading her out of her attic prison one night and selling her to a circus sideshow without her father's knowledge. Each chapter alternates between the two girls POVs, so you get a real sense of who they are, what their lives are like and what the times were like: Depression era America 30s vs post-war America 50s. All the characters are powerfully portrayed, but none more so than Lily and Julia. Both had miserable childhoods, Lily more so than Julia, but Julia's was bad enough that she felt she had to runaway at 16. Both are caring, optimistic, spunky, adventurous and kindhearted. Both attract good people to them. There are also very evil people in this book. One, Merrick, is almost a caricature of an evil man. He really has no redeeming qualities. Momma runs a close second. There are some interesting twists in this book. Just when you think you have everything figured out, you realize you don't. Well played. If the book has any flaws, it's the level of violence in it. There is physical violence, sexual abuse, and severe animal cruelty. At times it can be hard to take. Part of the book's inspiration came from a true incident of extreme animal abuse in 1916. That being said, animal abuse was and appears to sadly remain part of the circus culture. This is the first book that I have read by this author. It won't be the last.A definite recommend!"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16338394-karen", "userReview": "The story has a dual timeline - Lilly Blackwood in the 1930\u2019s and Julia Blackwood over 2 decades later.

I never got a sense of the 50\u2019s in Julia\u2019s story. There was too much inner dialogue throughout, especially from Julia. (\"What was she supposed to do now? And what about the horses? Were they okay? Would Claude show up to take care of them? Most of the horses would be fine..., but what about Blue and her baby?

Perhaps it was the fact that I've always had a fascination for the circus. As a young girl I can remember paying a whole 25 cents to enter the Side Show only to realize that they were \"fakes\" and feeling very upset with myself that I had wasted my hard earned quarter. Or maybe it was the animals...Oh my...being a true animal lover, my heart was captivated by Lilly's ability to \"connect\" with the animals, especially the elephants. The author characterizes the animals and their feelings perfectly. The novel is about two young women, with two different stories, during two different time periods. Their stories are expertly woven together by terrible grief and heartache, yet both have a beautiful love for life and animals. The novel begins in the 1930's where we meet a girl named Lilly who has been locked in the attic for her first 10 years of life and is soon sold to the circus by her mother because she was \"different\" or a monster, an abomination as her mother referred to her. The second story within is about Julia, in the 1950's, who left her cruel parents at 19, being blamed by her mother for her father's death. After inheriting the family home, Julia is desperately seeking to solve the mystery of the connection of a strange circus performer to her father. Slowly the reader, along with Julia, peels away the layers of secrets. During the latter part of the book I couldn't read fast enough to solve the mystery.I must warn the reader, though, that this story not only involves cruelty and mistreatment of children and people who are different, but also delves into cruelty towards animals. At several points I needed to stop reading and give myself some time before resuming.I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "JudiAnne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1266107-judianne", "userReview": "Even though I love Ellen Marie Wiseman\u2019s books I was hesitant to read her latest novel. I don\u2019t like circuses or zoos for that matter because I think it is cruel to keep animals out of their natural habitat. I decided to read the book because I loved Water for Elephants. I also have a love for of the altruistic behavior of elephants who are so much like humans. I\u2019ve found if the characters and the stories are well written, then reading something out of my comfort zone can be pleasant and quite entertaining and this book was all of that! That being said, let me tell you a little about this tragic but touching story.During the depression of 1930 Lilly\u2019s mother locked her in the attic of their Blackwood Manor Home and horse farm. Although 10 year old Lilly was a stunning albino her mother told her that she was an abomination and a monster. (I have to add, at this point I immediately thought of the book series, Flowers in the Attic.) When the circus came to town Lilly stayed by her dingy window, amazed at the bright lights and dreamed of visiting the circus. Under the guise of a visit to the circus, Lilly\u2019s mother dressed her in a pretty dress, took her by the hand and sold her to the circus Freak Show. Lilly was so terrified she started yearning for home and her tiny room in the attic. As Lilly settles in with the traveling circus she makes friends and discovers she has an immense connection with the elephants.Fast forward to the 1950s and we meet 18 year old Julia. She fled from Blackwood Manor when her father died. At first she lived on the streets grabbing food wherever she could. She finally found work in a diner but she was barely keeping her head above water. After being away from home for three years she is notified that both her parents died and that she has inherited Blackwood Manor. She is overwhelmed by the responsibility and decides to sell the house immediately. She falls in love with the horses and become friends with the caretaker and Veterinarian. She decides not to sell but update the house. When she starts cleaning out papers and files she finds circus advertisements hidden in her father\u2019s office and it piques her interest. She realizes there are some very dark secrets in the house and she starts searching, finding hidden meanings and connections to the past. Blackwood Manor is the focal point of this novel bringing together two girls, twenty years apart. I love reading about large old houses with deep dark secrets. I was surprised when I read in Ellen Marie Wiseman\u2019s ending notes that she loved \"Flowers in the Attic\" as much as I did. I recommend this book and Ms.Wiseman\u2019s other three books.

This book was no exception- the latest from Ellen Marie Wiseman did not disappoint!I have been in love with Ellen's work since her first novel, 'The Plum Tree,' and every time I read her latest book I think (and announce) that it's my favorite. Well, in keeping with that tradition, this is my favorite of Ellen's books! But really, it is. And here's a few reasons why: Story line  This is a sweeping tale across several decades, beginning in the early 1930s. Half of the book has a 'Flowers in the Attic' vibe; the other half is reminiscent of 'Water for Elephants.' Since both of those books are among my favorites, it's no surprise that I loved the story here. From the beginning, I was hooked and wanted to figure out where the story was going. This, much like 'Water for Elephants,' was hard for me to read because of my love for animals and my extreme hatred for circuses. That said, one can't argue that circuses provide beautiful imagery and set a lovely scene for a quirky story. This one set the backdrop of a mystery, a love story (or two!), and family drama.  Great Writing! Ellen's writing here is at its best. One of my favorite passages from the book reads, \"Then again, she didn't like small talk either, so she was glad he wasn't commenting on the weather or the landscape. Life was too big and too short and too important to talk about the lack of rain or the latest gossip. She wanted to know how people felt about themselves and one another, whether they were happy or sad. She wanted to know what made them feel loved and what hurt them to the core. She wanted to know about their past, how they got where they were, and their relationships with their mothers and fathers and siblings. She wanted to know if she was the only mixed-up person in the world who felt completely and utterly alone.\"  Characters  I loved Julia and Lilly - they were both very relatable. They both struck me as empaths as well, based on the way they reacted to the people and animals in their lives, and as a fellow empath I identified strongly with them. I also loved many of the secondary characters (Glory, Cole, Fletcher...) and hated the characters I was supposed to hate. The character development was on point. Two Worlds Collide The story was a wonderful mystery from beginning to end. The weaving of Lilly's tale and Julia's tale was beautiful. And I often wondered where it was all going. And when we arrived at the end, I was at peace. I never really figured it out- I thought I had, and I had pieces right- but it all clicked together in the end.

On a summer evening in 1931, Lilly Blackwood glimpses circus lights from the grimy window of her attic bedroom. Lilly isn't allowed to explore the meadows around Blackwood Manor. She's never even ventured beyond her narrow room. Momma insists it's for Lilly's own protection, that people would be afraid if they saw her. But on this unforgettable night, Lilly is taken outside for the first time--and sold to the circus sideshow. More than two decades later, nineteen-year-old Julia Blackwood has inherited her parents' estate and horse farm. For Julia, home was an unhappy place full of strict rules and forbidden rooms, and she hopes that returning might erase those painful memories. Instead, she becomes immersed in a mystery involving a hidden attic room and photos of circus scenes featuring a striking young girl. At first, The Barlow Brothers' Circus is just another prison for Lilly. But in this rag-tag, sometimes brutal world, Lilly discovers strength, friendship, and a rare affinity for animals. Soon, thanks to elephants Pepper and JoJo and their handler, Cole, Lilly is no longer a sideshow spectacle but the circus's biggest attraction. . .until tragedy and cruelty collide. It will fall to Julia to learn the truth about Lilly's fate and her family's shocking betrayal, and find a way to make Blackwood Manor into a place of healing at last. Moving between Julia and Lilly's stories, Ellen Marie Wiseman portrays two extraordinary, very different women in a novel that, while tender and heartbreaking, offers moments of joy and indomitable hope.", "title": "The Life She Was Given", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32980740-the-life-she-was-given", "average": 3.95, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1479186570l/32980740.jpg", "reviews": 1425, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5416814.Ellen_Marie_Wiseman", "name": "Ellen Marie Wiseman"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "Mystery", "Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32980740-the-life-she-was-given", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32926258-the-life-she-was-given", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17802747-what-she-left-behind", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13333093-the-plum-tree", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25406912-coal-river"]}
