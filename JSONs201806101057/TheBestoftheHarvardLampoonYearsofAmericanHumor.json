I was primarily drawn to it because of the lengthy list of contributors.We start off in the late 1800s/early 1900s, which is significantly earlier than I would have expected this journey to start. I personally really enjoyed \u201cWorst Aid to the Injured\u201d and \u201cHow I Was Taken at the Cleaners\u201d. I very much appreciated seeing humor that I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise associated with this time period.Now, because this is a collection of tales written by a number of various people, it\u2019s hit or miss. There are stories that are great and made me laugh out loud and then there were others that I skimmed through because they simply didn\u2019t interest me. In addition to this, a number of these stories were very much written in different times and because of that, they aren\u2019t all as inclusive as I hope for in my current stories.I mentioned at the beginning of this review that I mainly read this because I recognized a number of the names of the contributors. That doesn\u2019t start to kick in until about two-thirds of the way through the book, which would be about the mid-1980s. However, those names don\u2019t seem to stick around very long.Honestly, for me, this book was more miss than hit. I think if you\u2019re more familiar with the Harvard Lampoon and their work, you\u2019ll probably enjoy this a lot more. I was kindly provided a copy of this book by Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.Originally posted on The Reading Raindoe"}, {"userName": "NancyL Luckey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2029454-nancyl-luckey", "userReview": "Love all the Harvard Lampoon books!
