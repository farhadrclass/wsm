Right away, I was transported back in time to a very primitive world, a world without any kind of modern day conveniences, a world where religion and superstitions played a central role in the lives of the people. The world is brought to life by the voice of the narrator. When we first meet Adela, she is a bright, young, precocious little girl, the youngest child in a very large family. Adela is part of a huge extended family clan \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of aunts, uncles, cousins all around her. We learn a lot about her world through the eyes of a five year old. One of Adela\u2019s biggest fears is being taken away by the Confiscator, a government official who collects Jewish orphans, converts them to Islam, and gives them to a Muslim family to raise. In order to circumvent the Confiscator, most Jewish children were betrothed at a very young age \u2013 Adela, at five years old was almost considered a spinster.It is interesting to see the world through the innocent eyes of a child. While Adela is treated poorly by her mother, her father dotes on her and teaches her how to work with leather. As the story progresses, Adela\u2019s relatives move to her small village. Her Aunt Rahel is a henna artist, known all over for her talent. Her cousin Hani takes an immediate like to Adela and the two of them become close like sisters. Adela becomes fascinated with the art of henna.In Henna House, henna is not simply a temporary tattoo. It is a way of life where milestones in life are lovingly detailed on a woman\u2019s skin. The art of Henna has meaning \u2013 each swirl and curl and design determined by the woman\u2019s experience. The application of henna is a beautiful process, a party with many women sharing their stories and dreams. Adela longs to learn the art of henna, but her mother does not approve.Circumstances cause Adela and her extended family to leave their small village and they head for the port city of Aden. Life in Aden is very different. The British army is present and there are modern conveniences. Adela makes it a point to go to the port every day to look for her betrothed Asaf. In the meantime, another young boy from her past is interested in her.Adela\u2019s life is not easy. She takes pleasure in teaching young women how to read and she works at the refugee area. She suffers through a horrible betrayal and conditions in Yemen deteriorate. In between June 1949 and September 1950, Yemenite Jews were flown to Israel in Operation Magic Carpet. Adela\u2019s family was one of these families.Henna House was a fantastic glimpse into the past and a wonderful reading experience. I highly recommend it.Thank you to NetGalley and Scribner for a review copy of this book.Review posted on Badass Book Reviews.

Henna House is not a tale delivered by the author with a light hand to her readers. In another sense, this decidedly isn't literary play; I would not describe the form as experimental, exploratory, or organically tailored to the content in a responsive or flexible way. Instead, the narrative here is as purposeful in tone and effect as any I can presently recall. Eve's narrator's voice has been well-honed, and more strikingly, the discourse in this text is never less than unabashedly powerful. Throughout the detailed work, the reader senses the heart of the matter being directly set forth; nothing is roundabout or oblique -- let alone trivial. In sum, this novel delivers exceptional drama without ever struggling with the bounds of good taste or the threat of melodrama.The novel is as rich as it is heavy. The plot blends tragedy with the warmth of carefully drawn family relationships and other deep human bonds. There is joy and sorrow. There is history and culture (of Yemeni Jews in the 1920's, 30's and 40's) to fill a nonfictional account of the same, included seamlessly in the story and naturally presented fully to a mostly ignorant reader.This narrator, the heroine, and her familiar coming of age story (in content yet strange in particular detail) will stick with this reader for a long time. If your reading of this book is anything like mine, you will be substantially enriched and deeply satisfied by this book. It's something really special, in my estimation.This review is long overdue given the tremendous gift of this novel in and of itself, let alone in light of Nomi Eve's generous supply of my very own copy of the work (which implicitly raises a duty to review honestly when the book is months away from release). I am grateful to the author for this opportunity and the experience her art provided me. I encourage readers with any interest to read this book ASAP.

This was a group of people I really knew nothing about and I've always been interested in henna. This is about Adela Damari starting in the 1920s in Yemen. It follows her life as she tries to avoid the Confiscator who takes Jewish children as part of the Orphan's Decree and they are instantly adopted by the local Muslim community. I enjoyed the relationship between Adela and her cousin Hani who introduces her to henna application and meanings. I enjoyed the harsh relationship she had with her mother. This is so worth the time.

Went in expecting a dramatic story of a Yemenite Jewish girl learning Henna in order to set her free. What I got was a story with characters doing things that made me feel.... nothing.Adela Damari has all the makings to be a powerful antagonist. She made a valiant effort, but ultimately didn't come off the page for me. This book starts out with her fearful of the Confiscator- a man who threatened to take Adela if her father died before she was married to another. This caused her to become promised to her cousin, Asaf at the tender age of 9. The story picked up from there, but the threads never fully connected. Too many story lines, going in different directions, with a final powerful surprise event towards the end-- which still didn't come across emotionally to me."}, {"userName": "Ruthie", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/991634-ruthie", "userReview": "This is a beautifully written, meticulously researched book. At first I thought I was reading about a young girl in Biblical times Yemen. The Jews and the Muslims are living side by side with the Muslims ruling and controlling every minute detail of the lives of the Jews. The homes, clothing, living conditions, and cultural mores are biblical. It was quite shocking to realize that the story starts around the 1920's! Then I thought about how many people, especially girls and women are still living in similar conditions in much of the world, and it was not hard to believe that such an almost pre-historic existence could exist concurrently with the first trans-Atlantic flight of Charles Lindburgh, the Baseball career of Babe Ruth etc.All that aside, this is a beautiful, rich story of a young girl growing up in a small primative village where girls are betrothed as toddlers, married as soon as they bleed, and live rather bleak lives. Jewish children who are orphaned can legally be \"snatched\" by \"The Confiscator\", a Muslim, and then converted to Islam and adopted by Muslim families. Adela is the youngest child, the only girl, with a loving but ailing father, a cold, harsh mother, and older, brutish brothers. At the age of 5 things are looking dismal as parents cannot find her a husband -to -be. An exotic cousin comes into her life and things change dramatically. (No more plot details.....)The story flows Adela as she grows up, learns about being a woman, finds love, friendship, sisterhood, heartbreak and discovers the world beyond her tiny village. The art of Henna plays a huge role and it is a fascinating one. As someone who has had minor hennas applied I found the descriptions of the role henna played in the Yemenite culture so interesting. Once again there is this commonality between the Jewish and Muslim faiths....(The author has created a website that offers more information about Henna etc). Nomi Eve has created memorable characters, and shone light into a culture and people who were almost destroyed because of Hitler, WW2 and the creation of the State of Israel. As the Yemini Jews fled to Israel many chose to adopt modern lifestyles and their dress, foods and even hennas were pushed aside. Happily there is now a resurgence of appreciation for these cultural touchstones and Nomi Eve's novel will help to further encourage and celebrate them."}, {"userName": "Mmars", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2243098-mmars", "userReview": "Before talking about what I didn\u2019t like about the book I\u2019d like to talk about its importance and encourage people to read it. With Yemen currently in extreme crisis (2015) I encourage readers to pick up this book. There is a lot of information, clearly told, about Yemen from 1930s to post-WWII. All political and cultural upheaval is confusing to outsiders and without some background knowledge, it is even more difficult. In the 1930s Yemen was divided between a Britain protectorate containing Aden and a Yemeni Muslim kingdom containing Sana\u2019a. Aden was a busy port city and crucial to British forces during WWII. Sana\u2019a was a rural community enmeshed in tradition. This is the story of Adela, a young Jewish girl growing up in Sana\u2019a. Like many of the Jews there, her father is a craftsman, a shoemaker whose livelihood depends on the more wealthy Muslim ruling class. She is seven and the \u201cConfiscator\u201d is waiting for her ailing father to die so he can claim Adela as his child and raise her as a Muslim. To prevent this she needs to be betrothed, but all of the boys her mother finds suffer tragedies and die, therefore giving Adela a reputation as being a curse. Her mother arranges a betrothal to her cousin Asaf who arrives with his father from trade journeys and who is unaware Adela\u2019s curse. Against common practice, they become friends. Adela becomes enmeshed in the custom of henna when her cousin Hani and her parents move from Aden to Sana\u2019a to escape the dangers they suffered there. The rest of the story lays itself out as history unveils itself and the remaining families must leave Sana\u2019a for Aden and finally smuggled to Israel by plane shortly in the aftermath of WWII. The history the Yemeni Jews in the 20th century is largely unknown. I first learned of it in a Yemeni jeweler\u2019s shop in Israel. So despite what follows, I still recommend the book. It reads well and has a compelling storyline. The characters are well delineated and the descriptions of the Yemeni culture and customs are marvelously described. It is a very readable book. Unfortunately at times the important factual information impeded upon the flow of the book. And too often I questioned the authenticity of Adela\u2019s actions. I found the whole cave story largely implausible. Some characters seemed too good to be true and her mother unbelievably cold and unloving. Adela\u2019s encounters with Binyamin (a neighbor boy) felt contrived. So there are reasons this book was largely overlooked by reviewers and not purchased by libraries. But Nomi Eve is a talented writer. It read quickly and I often found myself lost in Adela\u2019s world.

Desert villages, a little girl who wants to read and not be married off to an old man, the microcosm of families, and Adela's knowledge of her expanding world were all a rich story unto themselves, but the final third of the book is an even larger story. Readers will follow Adela from a young girl hopeful to not be rounded up as an orphan to a woman far from her birthplace and loved ones.

In hopes of preventing forced adoption, she is engaged to her cousin Asaf when she is just a child.

Every mother, aunt, sister and cousin is a vibrant character. The story doesn't shy away from the injustices that face women around the world, but it gives them strength and beauty.\u00a0I also liked Adela's honest narration of her childhood. From time to time she recounts what she remembers, and then balances it with what an older female relative remembers. And isn't that an honest take on memory?!Henna House\u00a0is about the lives of women, their loves and their relationships.

Adela Damari, a young Jewish girl, is getting close to womanhood, (determined by her getting her period), but has no prospects of a husband. At this early age if she has no prospects and her father, who is not healthy, dies she can be adopted by the Muslim community. This is done by the Confiscator.She does become betrothed to her cousin Asaf, but Asaf leaves the community to travel with his father who is a merchant, although promising he will return for her.In the meantime hennaing becomes a part of her life as she finds companionship in her relatives. This becomes very important in her life as her parents die and the Jewish community is forced to leave their home and move to the city of Aden.While making a new life for herself Adela finds a young man from her prior life as a suitor but still feels strongly about Asaf.

Narrated by Adela Damari, a Yemeni Jew, it's a sweeping family saga that captivates and beguiles, beckons and betrays. It is laden with culture and dreams of a people and the interpretation of traditional superstition of signs and omens. Even as a young girl, Adela dreams, defies, and loves; she's stubborn and she's loyal. And she's promised in marriage to her first cousin Asaf at the young age of eight. Integral to the story are Adela's Uncle Barhun, Aunt Rahel and Cousin Hani. Aunt Rahel is an oft-maligned, gifted henna stylist and mysterious healer with her herbs and potions. Hani, who becomes Adela's intimate friend and confidante, teaches Adela the intricate art of henna design replete with hidden messages, which will come back to haunt her as her pupil \"bests\" her in years to come. It's a book of culture and tradition, of religion and relationships, of many interesting and relatable characters, some flawed, but well drawn and with surprising depth.

It was summer. The air was heavy. The moon was full. It all made sense at the time. I had no idea how very close we came to correctly approximating the ritual of henna, which I did not understand to be such a robust and ritualized art form until I read Nomi Eve\u2019s Henna House. Historical fiction thrills me in concept and reality; the idea that while being entertained I might also learn something vital; the possibility of acquiring \u2013 by osmosis! by accident! \u2013 facts and words and wisdom missing from my vocabulary and worldview. In Henna House we get not just the epic saga of a young Yemenite Jew\u2019s coming of age but also a geography lesson and an environmental education as Adela Damari and her family trek mid-20th century through Arabia to the newly-formed Israel. Thanks to this book, I learned as much about this foreign land as I learned about her complex people as I followed them through the course of a life- and land-altering generation.And in the sort of sensual language too often forsaken in this age of sound bites and 140-character Tweets, I learned about henna, \u201cthe red geometric flurry \u2026 that seemed to tell stories at once simple and incomprehensible\u201d and the rituals that make the hennaing process, exclusive to the domain of women, as intimate and dreamy and communal as it was when I naively limned it in my young adulthood.Henna House abounds with stories of hennaed women: aunts and sisters and neighbors and cousins like Adela and \u201cHani [who] thrust her hand into mine, asking me one hundred questions all at once about the fairy tales I knew, the secrets I didn\u2019t, the stories I would maybe be so kind as to finish for her, for she had come to a point in the plot that needed a fresh perspective.\u201dIf it is stories about women and their mysterious ways that you crave \u2026 if you believe that shared stories can bind and color us \u2026 Henna House is not to be missed.Update: Henna House is one of twenty-one books recently called out as Great Group Reads for 2015 by the Women\u2019s National Book Association."}, {"userName": "Sandie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1331967-sandie", "userReview": "Nomi Eve\u2019s HENNA HOUSE an expansive historical novel that vividly depicts the exotic world of Yemeni Jews in the first decades of the 20th century. It is a riveting portrait rooted in real life. It tells not only of a lost culture but deals with the domestic lives of Jewish families (particularly the women) in that particular time and place as it addressed the Jewish tradition of tattooing with henna, family relationships, marriage, betrayal, karma, love, forgiveness as well as an arbitrary statute known as the Orphans Decree which authorized the state to confiscate orphaned Jewish children and raise them as Muslims.The central character in the story is Adela Damari, the daughter of a sickly Jewish cobbler and his petulant wife. Due to her fathers illness the family is terrified at the thought that Adela could adopted by a Muslim family and forced to convert. With the arrival in their small village of her father\u2019s brother and his son it appears that an engagement to her cousin, Asaf, may offer the solution to five year old Adela\u2019s problem. The book goes on to detail the various events of Adela\u2019s life over subsequent years and those family members, like Aunt Rahel and cousin Hani, who introduce her to the art and meaning of the henna drawings. While the history of the Jews of the Saudi peninsula is informative and instructional, it is the interaction between the various characters that truly drives this story while utilizing henna as the conduit for the unifying themes of family, art and storytelling.Nomi Eve\u2019s exhaustive research and her love of her subject matter is evident in this fascinating book and the plethora of material for discussion should make it a must read for every book club.

I didn't find it necessary to the story and honestly it was disturbing.

Or gets too involved in telling tales accented with magical realism instead of showing the main story.

For an example of a book that has not earned my patience, I give you Henna House. The book starts when the main character is five years old and takes two hundred of its three hundred pages to get her to sixteen years old (and married). There will be plenty of readers who are enthralled enough by the rich description of Yemenite Jewish culture in the early twentieth century that they won't mind the slow going. I couldn't get into it, though.Part of this is because the author was writing a child's point of view for most of the book, and I just didn't find the character that child-like or that interesting. A huge part of the plot was all about Adela needing a husband just in case her parents died before she reached puberty, so that she would not be adopted into a Muslim family while still a child. Really, a lot of the book is about Adela's love life before she's even reached puberty. And the problem is that the Chekhov's gun is never fired. So Adela is the first person narrator of the book, discussing her childhood, and I just never felt her actions as a child all that authentic, even with the differences in culture. Same with her fiance, whom she meets when he is about five years old. The prologue of the book says that the narrator thought long and hard about where to start her story, and that she decided that it all began when she was five years old and met the Confiscator (person in charge of gathering up orphaned Jewish children and placing them into Muslim families) when she was five. Well, I'm here to tell you that I think the story could have and should have begun two hundred pages into this three hundred page book. We could still get the backstory without the agonizingly long lead up, and then find out a lot more about what actually happens to Adela and her family and friends as an adult. Because once Adela does get married, a lot happens, and it ends up getting glossed over hurriedly instead of getting the attention that all the changes in the relationships so painstakingly set up deserved. I was far more interested in what happened to Adela as an adult than as a child. This is a foible of authors, especially first-time authors, that I wish would go away. I can understand that they have invested a lot of time and thought into their characters' history, motivations, and backstory. However, you don't need to give the reader all of that word by word. You can jump into the part of the story that moves and changes and show, not tell, your characters' background. There are some exceptions to this- Hild by Nicola Griffith comes to mind. Maybe that genre and period of history is just so much more interesting to me that I am willing to be more patient with it, but the author is also more experienced and knows the sort of story she wants to tell.Again, there will be plenty of readers so happy to fall into the world of this book that this will not be a problem for them. Spices, sounds, the feel of the Middle Eastern Jewish community is lovingly done. Just not for me."}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5754006-melinda", "userReview": "I'm really torn about this one. On the one hand, I loved reading about a culture--the Yemeni Jews--about which I knew precisely nothing. I think it is too easy for non-Jewish readers to think that there is only one or two types of Judaism, so I really enjoyed learning about this particular culture. And I think this is the first book I'd ever read that was set in Yemen, so there is that.I also really loved Eve's writing voice. She's lyrical without getting too wrapped up in her own language. She also strikes a nice balance between explaining culture-specific terms and leaving some for the reader to define for themselves through context. I find that many authors writing about another culture either go one way or the other, so I appreciated that Eve was very moderate in this.But, there were some technical things about this book that really bothered me. For one thing, I felt like 80% of this book was just backstory for the last 20%. Then, once I hit the point where the story really began, the pace of the book picked up so much it felt like a race to the finish. I do wish that Eve had evened out the tempo of this book so that the reader doesn't feel like the story starts to fly by them right as it starts getting good.Eve also seemed to have trouble with foreshadowing and extraneous details. There were a number of details that felt like they should be developed into the plot but just never went anywhere. Conversely, the bonafide foreshadowing was very obvious and almost felt like there should be a \"dut dut DUN\" every time it occured.There was one other thing that made me very, very uncomfortable about this book. I actually tried to ignore it when evaluating my thoughts of this book, but it ended up coloring how I saw much of the book. At one point in the book, rather early on (which was especially unfortunate as it did color most of the book afterwards for me), there is a rather graphic sexual incident between two prepubescent (ages 10 and 11) children. I have a reasonable tolerance for sexual content in books, but not when it concerns children. To me, it was incredibly inappropriate and, frankly, not even necessary to the story.So, there are my jumbled thoughts. I honestly don't know if I would recommend this to another reader--there is, after all, much to commend it. However, there are also enough drawbacks to make me question it as a recommendation."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10534951-kim", "userReview": "Wow. Reading this book reminded me again of why I like to read historical fiction. I knew that there were Jewish people who lived side by side in the Middle East right after WWI and that many of the Jewish people came to live in Israel when the country was established. However, I never really thought about how different and almost primitive the lives of these people seem today. The main character, a young girl, has never seen a car and her people travel by donkey.She is constantly threatened by the fear of being snatched away and given to a Muslim family if her sickly father dies. (This was known as the Orphans Law.)As a girl, she has little value. But she learns the art of henna from a relative and discovers that there is much more to the world than her limited sphere. The author has done her homework and has woven a love story into the historical context. Two very different cultures living side by side, yet worlds apart. Although the time period starts in the 1920s, the characters seem to exist in a long ago past. How interesting to bind the story through an explanation of that ancient decorative art form - henna."}, {"userName": "Lauren Stoolfire", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6857324-lauren-stoolfire", "userReview": "I read an ARC of Henna House that I picked up at my local thrift store.Henna House by Nomi Eve tells the story of Adela Damari, her family and community, as well as the rituals that bind them together. It all begins in Yemen in 1920 when she's a small girl and her parents want to find her a future husband, but with her parents in poor health she becomes adopted by her uncle from a far off city. Alongside her cousin, she learns about the rituals of henna tattooing which open Adela's eyes to a wider world as she learns to love her heritage. The story covers a several decades and cover a lot of what happens in Adela's life, but this is the first moment her eyes are truly opened. This novel is an intimate look at Adela's family life and it paints a well researched look at the history of the setting. It is truly a beautifully written and rich story with fantastically developed characters that I highly recommend to fans of sweeping historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Elisa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15868385-elisa", "userReview": "This is a gorgeous novel - I will skip the plot synopsis since others have done that - but I want to say that each chapter in this book is like a multi-faceted jewel and could be read as a beautiful story on its own; at the same time the chapters build and grow an engrossing novel that follows a girl as she grows from a child to a woman in a Yemenite Jewish community in the mid 20th century. Meticulously researched, this book expertly weaves intimate and personal details with sweeping historical events. There are so many levels on which to enjoy this book - the pleasure of reading its exquisite metaphors and lyrical writing, experiencing the rich historical detail, learning about henna, following a young woman\u2019s growth and development during turbulent political times, and marveling about Eve\u2019s artistry.

A story full of love, loss, tragedy and the enduring and relentless human spirit that never gives up.\"Toward the end of the night, I looked up at my aunt and was startled. She looked different. She was radiant. She was a queen riding on an elephant in a distant jungle. Hani was her princess. I looked around. The tapestries on the walls began to shift forms, and the animals peeked out from behind trees whose names I didn't know.

In my research, I discovered this book. In it, I certainly learned a good deal about the tradition of Henna amongst Yemenite Jews.But this book goes way beyond a story of Henna or even of Yemenite Jews to become a family saga with love and deceit as key elements. The writing is wonderfully descriptive and the story is many-faceted with much depth. In the end, I would have to describe it as \"dark\" but I am glad that I read it and hope some of my friends will do the same so we can discuss it."}, {"userName": "Janice", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35562349-janice", "userReview": "This book was captivating-- gorgeously written, with evocative, rich language and interesting characters. It was also great to learn about a slice of history and a part of the world that I did not know about- Jewish community in Yemen right before World War 2.
