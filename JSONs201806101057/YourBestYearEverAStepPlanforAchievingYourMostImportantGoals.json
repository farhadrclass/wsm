But I was very disappointed. Michael use to teach solid, step by step approaches to creating a platform, writing, and setting goals. But like his podcast that I seldom listen to anymore, this book was more fluff and stories than anything else. For anyone who has ever read anything on setting goals, you can probably skip this book. I kept waiting to get to the meat - but sadly never did! Maybe I missed the point of this book, but I didn\u2019t have any practical take aways. I\u2019m confused at the hype of the book honestly \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "Anna LeBaron", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1004111-anna-lebaron", "userReview": "I am delighted that Michael Hyatt's \"Best Year Ever\" program is now in book form! I have used his program for five years in a row to set goals for each year and then accomplish so many of them, year after year! This has been a game-changer for me. Actually, a LIFE-CHANGER! Since I began using these proven methods I have become a published author and started a new career! Imagine setting goals and then actually following through and doing the work required to reach them! How would that change your life? Michael Hyatt will lead you though his \"5-step plan for achieving your most important goals\". In doing so you will discover:* What's holding you back right now* How to overcome your past setbacks* The seven attributes of effective goals* How to quit-proof your goals* The role of habits in personal achievement* What to do when you feel stuckI recommend that you not rush through the reading of the book. Instead, read it thoughtfully, and invest the time to complete each Action Plan as you go through the book. I also highly recommend doing this with a friend. Having someone to celebrate your achievements with makes the rewards of accomplishing your goals that much richer!"}, {"userName": "Trisha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17409865-trisha", "userReview": "I think a healthy suspicion of any guarantees of making a certain life for ourselves is good, unless what's being offered are promises from God's Word. We are not the captain of our souls, even though many live as though we are. This type of book is somewhat of an unusual read for me, but after seeing it recommended a couple of times by a teacher I greatly admire, I decided to give it a read. We make our plans, and God directs our steps; that reminder was never given in this book, at least not in those terms. Still, we should make our plans, and I think Hyatt does a clear job of laying out a very doable plan for making goals and pursuing them. If you've struggled with this in the past, I think Hyatt's plan would be helpful.I especially appreciated his scarcity vs. abundance thinking, and his recommendation to consider how our past failures keep us from future goals. His advice to not \"eat that frog\" and instead do smaller actions to fuel the harder ones is helpful, too. He's quotable and engaging. He outlines all of the steps thoroughly and provides planning templates as well. There's much practical advice here, but don't look for something deep spiritually. For example, the exhortation to practice gratitude comes across as the popular, generic trend that it is instead of a purposeful giving of thanks to the Lord that flows from a love for Him, and God's promises are not the focus at any point. Those endorsing Hyatt's book include the range of Tony Robbins to Andy Stanley to Donald Miller, and Hyatt references Brene Brown multiple times. Such a wide range of company is quite telling in itself."}, {"userName": "Misty Beller", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27682752-misty-beller", "userReview": "An exceptional book for anyone. Whether you're a go-getter and want to move to the next level personally and professionally, or whether you're just tired of slogging through the same ol' rut, this book is a must-read. I've set goals for years, some I've accomplished and some I haven't. I love the way the author gives tools to examine all aspects of our lives and find the areas where we want to take action. The book then takes us step-by-step through creating goals that stretch us, then developing a game plan to make them happen. I'm already starting my new goals and thrilled to see the progress I'll make!"}, {"userName": "Ricky", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68995003-ricky", "userReview": "I am thrilled for Michael\u2019s new book. I have read both Platform and Living Forward and was thrilled when he announced he would be sharing his Best Year Ever content in book format. I am about 2/3 of the way though his book and it is proving to be just as beneficial as the other two. What I love about this book is the simple actionable step by step process Michael walks you though to accomplish what he promises. I recommend this book because I believe it will help you identify, define and achieve the goals you have set for the next year (which doesn\u2019t have to start in January although that might help). If that isn\u2019t enough of a recommendation for you to go and buy this book now here are a few of the benefits I have gotten from this book already.1. Michael is clear with his approach. I have read many leadership books and business books on all kinds of ways to achieve goals and lead people. The problem is too many times it is not clearly communicated what the action really is that I need to take it is simply just a written record of the journey the author has been on and leaves me wondering how to apply that to my own situation. Michael does a great job of making it clear what and how I can take action on the process he lays out.2. He uses practical and current examples. I love that this book comes after tens of thousands of people have gone through his online course and he uses examples from those alumni that apply pracically to real world situations. They may not be the same as my situation but the principles can still apply, again because Michael clearly communicaties how this works.3. Nothing is oversimplified or sugar-coated. I hate listening to people who have succeeded at life or business and they have no idea how they have done it. They simply say keep going and you\u2019ll get there but that isn\u2019t helpful because it doesn\u2019t address some of the most important aspects of achieving goals. For me those aspects are knowing what struggles I will face and connecting to the fact that failure doens\u2019t mean failing it is simply an opportunity to learn that I need to make a change to succeed. Michael does a great job of highlighting these things and helping the reader understand how to translate it to your own life.4. Digging in to find your motivation. I believe that understanding what lies under the step by step process is what truly leads to success. Michael helps define how to find your motivation and how to tap into applying it to your situation to maximize your success. This is vital in moving from simply writing down goals to taking action on the goals you hold most valuable for the upcoming year!If you have been looking for a book to help you move the mark and succeed at what is most important to you in work, family and life this is it. Applying the process and using the templates in this book will help you move from thinking about what you want to do to getting it done. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I am."}, {"userName": "Karin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32325191-karin", "userReview": "So, I feel like you can't really review a lifehack/ self help book immediately upon completion, but I really like how action oriented this book was.

Last year I read his co-authored Living Forward book. That one left a lot to be desired. This book is different. Hyatt is my go-to guru for goal setting. I use a modified version of his Evernote system for my own personal goal setting. Though I haven't taken his 5 Days to Your Best Year Ever, I'm pretty sure this book captures everything he teaches in that course. A few things that caught my attention.\"If you already have everything you need to achieve your goal, then your goal\u2019s probably too small.\"\"An apparent lack of resources might be the most important resource we have.\"\"As you\u2019re thinking about assigning deadlines, don\u2019t make them all December 31. Distant deadlines discourage action.\"The last one was important for me. Many of the goals I had set as distant deadlines last year were much more difficult for me to accomplish than the ones I had set shorter deadlines for. This year, I tried to add a few more helpful steps to ensure that my December 31 goals don't fall by the wayside.Hyatt's SMARTER acronym expands on the well-known SMART goals formula (with a twist) and helps anyone interested in shaping better goals in getting those crafted well. His LEAP acronym at the end of the book is also unique and helpful if you're looking to make big changes over the course of a year.Great templates in the back of the book that I plan on using in the future. Looking to set and finish goals? This is definitely a good book to read t0 start the year."}, {"userName": "Joli Hamilton", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20662564-joli-hamilton", "userReview": "Excellent strategy guide for developing new habits and achieving goals. I only wish Hyatt didn\u2019t fall into the trap of using almost all male examples in his anecdotal case studies. It sticks out like a sore thumb and becomes grating quickly.

He has a comforting voice with a bit of contagious call to action that he adds to what he publishes. Given his earlier book called \u201cPlatform\u201d described how he had combined all kinds of media to get his message across and build his business, it\u2019s no wonder that this platform master needs to create content for his own platform \u2013 his mix of social media, podcasts, books, training, email lists, etc. This book came about as his daughter suggested he create a class on personal planning. After running the class and based on feedback, Hyatt cleaned up his advice and packaged it in this book. Like all Hyatt books, he includes many personal anecdotes to illustrate his topics, in addition to using business examples and in this case, examples from former students of his class. I found these examples to be the best part of the book. Most of the advice is similar to that of other goal planning books I\u2019ve read. He includes the concepts of having set goals, like saving $20,000 by December 31, and having process goals, like reading a business book a month. He pulls in other common topics from planning self-help books, like habits, SMART objectives, etc. Again, if you are well read in personal goal setting, this is of a kind. If not, this isn\u2019t bad, and has a friendly voice. Interesting: Hyatt ran Thomas Nelson Publishing for many years. He mentions in this book that he had a dog named Nelson. Strange that he had a dog with the same name as his employer. I\u2019m now thinking of naming my next dog System."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13873214-dan", "userReview": "I have read many, many books on setting and achieving goals. What sets Your Best Year Ever spare from all the others? Honestly, not much. The material covered is pretty well known: SMART goals (Hyatt adds ER to make them SMARTER), understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d behind a goal, making a plan, getting help, employing an accountability buddy, etc. Goal setting has been covered so well over the decades, we should all be experts at accomplishing our dreams by now. So why did Michael Hyatt feel the importance of writing another book on goals? Because, frankly, we DON\u2019T accomplish our goals. We set them with great anticipation and then get discouraged when we don\u2019t achieve our wildest dreams. Yes, some do, but many of us don\u2019t. And that is what Hyatt digs into. Michael Hyatt has, for several years now, run a special class each your to help participants set and achieve goals to their Best Year Ever. He has some experience in pulling off the feat of helping people do the difficult (I won\u2019t say impossible - that would be too pessimistic, even for me). Yes, paying several hundred dollars to get some help in achieving one\u2019s goals is certainly a way of getting motivated. And it is possible to achieve wild success without paying the money. So what makes Your Best Year Ever different? Stories (there are a lot of them) definitely help explain his points and help build the \u201cI can do it too\u201d feeling. Process and forms keep things lined up and in proper order to maximize potential. I believe the difference is Resonance. Let\u2019s face it. Michael Hyatt has a very large audience who follow him via his blog, podcast, books, videos and speaking. He has done an excellent job of being everywhere and helping people get excited about improving themselves. So it follows that when the student is ready, the teacher will appear. Michael has spent the last ten+ years getting people ready. And when the time is right for that person, the book is just one more way to help people execute. I almost signed up for Hyatt\u2019s very first Best Year Ever online course several years ago, but for various reasons, I wasn\u2019t ready to commit to it. Several years have gone by and every year I have wondered about it. Last year, I bought his book Living Forward and read it. This year I am implementing it. So it follows that I want to make some movement toward achieving my Life Plan and achieve the goals that inherently go along with it. This year, Best Year Ever is resonating with me. The student is finally ready.

The timing of this release is perfect as it will allow me to finish out 2017 on a high and jump into 2018 with clear direction and purpose.The best part of this book is Hyatt's assertion that goals often bleed into one another and setting a single goal isn't particularly realistic.

Hyatt\u2019s writing and products often presume you are your own boss, and so in control of your own feedback loop and what a typical workday looks like. I don\u2019t believe this is the common example and so he loses me as an audience at times when he seems to be writing more for CEOs and higher-end business leaders than for the \u2018average\u2019 professional looking for more from life and to live it more fully."}, {"userName": "Karen Roth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39799158-karen-roth", "userReview": "I really like Michael\u2019s approach to goal setting and execution.

The program that is detailed in the book is designed to help you find clarity, develop courage, and leverage the commitment you need to accomplish your most important personal and professional goals. The book includes a link to the author\u2019s LifeScore Assessment to help you quickly spot areas of improvement and measure your personal growth over time.The book takes you through three 5 Steps:1. Overcome any doubts you might have about experiencing your best year ever.2. Get closure on the past.3. A 7-part framework for setting goals.4. Find Your \u201cWhy\u201d.5. Take action with three tactics.The author states that our beliefs play a significant part in how we approach life. The greater the number of setbacks we\u2019ve experienced in life, the less likely we are to believe we can prevail. Both positively and negatively, your beliefs have tremendous impact on your experience of life. Recognizing that fact is the first stage in experiencing your best year ever.A limiting belief is a misunderstanding of the present that shortchanges the future. However, you don\u2019t have to be confined by limited beliefs. Instead, you can exchange them for liberating truths, and he provides a six-step process to help you do that. The author tells us that whatever our circumstances, we have the power to pursue a better future.After limiting beliefs, the next most common barrier we encounter is the past. If we are going to experience our best year ever, we need to harness the power of what he refers to as backward thinking. Unless we learn from our experiences, we can\u2019t grow.The author addresses the important subject of our regrets. He states that when it comes to experiencing your best year ever, we can leverage our regrets to reveal opportunities we would otherwise miss. Regret is a powerful indicator of future opportunity.He addresses resiliency, gratitude and writing down our goals. He states that he\u2019s never met anyone who wins at very much for very long without resiliency. Gratitude is fundamental for achieving our goals. He writes that you will never have more of what you want until you become thankful for what you have. He states that committing your goals to writing is foundational.The author shares some very helpful information about goals. Many are familiar with SMART goals. The author introduces us to the SMARTER model:S \u2013 SpecificM \u2013 MeasurableA \u2013 ActionableR \u2013 RiskyT \u2013 Time-KeyedE \u2013 ExcitingR \u2013 RelevantGoals are fundamentally about what you\u2019re going to do. They are not just about what you accomplish. It\u2019s about what you become.The author suggests that you should limit yourself to seven to ten goals that align with your life, values and ambitions. You should use a mixture of what he refers to as achievement (focused on one-time accomplishments) and habit (regular, ongoing activity) goals. You should set a few per quarter so that you can space your effort out evenly throughout the year. Your LifeScore will help you in crafting a set of goals that are aligned with your personal growth path. You should include goals from several different LifeScore domains.The author introduces us to three zones for goals \u2013 Comfort, Discomfort and Delusional. For a goal to stretch us it has to stand outside your Comfort Zone. Your best year ever lives somewhere beyond your Comfort Zone. You should set goals in the Discomfort Zone. Goals in this zone will challenge, and result in your best performance, while goals in the Delusional Zone will leave you frustrated and discouraged. While we should set goals in the Discomfort Zone, the way to tackle a goal is to start with a task in the Comfort Zone. You should tackle your easiest task first.In introducing the concept of our \u201cwhy\u201d, he writes that people lose their way when they lose their why. Next to finding your why, mastering your motivation is key for developing the necessary persistence to make it through what he refers to as the messy middle.If you expect to experience your best year ever, you must take action. Activation Triggers are simple statements or actions that streamline the process of reaching our goals.You should regularly review your goals and motivations. He suggests daily, weekly and quarterly reviews.He discusses the importance of intentional relationships in achieving our goals, using an illustration on how J.R.R. Tolkien was encouraged by C.S. Lewis to write his book The Lord of the Rings.He writes about the importance of celebrating your wins. Celebrating validates your work and is a key component of living a full, meaningful life.He tells us that the future is in our hands, but only if we act today.The book began as an online course. It includes many interesting stories, such as the author\u2019s goal of running a marathon. As I read the book, I thought of goals I wanted to achieve in 2018, such as finishing a book I\u2019ve started on integrating faith and work. The book also includes a lot of good information from research studies.The practical book is best to read with a pen and notebook handy. A detailed \u201cAction Plan\u201d is included for each step.

I also received a series of videos to support the FFP and the audio version and hardcover of this book, as well as entrance into a Facebook Group support community. With all of these pieces working together, the book receives 5 stars. Michael has put forth a simple easy-to-follow process to set SMARTER goals and put mechanisms in place to achieve them. To start, I liked the additional E for exciting and R for risky as a goal must feed us with a passion to strive in the messy middle (he borrows more than once and sites Brene Brown's \"Daring Greatly\"/\"Rising Strong\"). The goal is also worth striving toward if it is a bit outside of our comfort zone.I enjoyed the focus on rooting deeply in the \"Why?\" of a goal and creating a process of daily, weekly, and quarterly review. I also liked the instructions on creating activation triggers, something I do often but didn't realize was a part of why I succeed with those goals over others. There is even an on-line LifeScore Inventory to determine which sectors of your life are most in need of improvement for those who have no clue where to begin or to serve as validation. Most of the information was not new to me having done my fair share of self-improvement, productivity, time management, goal setting reading, but I enjoyed the simple structure and appreciated all of the support material which wraps around. Keeping my goals in front of me daily is an important piece of the puzzle and for that reason, I highly recommend using the Full Focus Planner alongside this book even if just for the first quarter. The Facebook community provides some support from great people and additional resources for goal setting. The #1 takeaway for me, and one I hope I don't forget, is to LEAP on a goal: Lean in Engage -to get clarityActivate -starting with action step &Pounce - don't wait. Contrary to the anacronym, the LEAP doesn't have to start out HUGE just with a small action step taken immediately to gain traction and momentum. I often try to swallow the frog on BIG goals first and choke. Taking small, incremental steps each day will get the 'tortoise' win more often than the hare sprint. Again, you can sense this isn't revolutionary, but Michael's presentation will help you refocus at any point in the year. He also shares a lot of his personal process. I love that Bible study and prayer with his wife before bed are both a part of his daily habit goals. I especially appreciated the insight into his struggles to balance relationships and work as a highly accomplished author, speaker, and entrepreneur. It was insightful and motivating to get a peek behind the curtain. In short, I am glad I went for the whole enchilada."}, {"userName": "Janette Fuller", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4919001-janette-fuller", "userReview": "This book was released on January 2nd, but it is not just another book about New Year's resolutions.

Overall, I found the book to be well-researched and relatable, with plenty of practical insights to implement right away (I now have Plant Nanny on my phone...) as well as long-term strategy planning. I also liked the Action Steps at the end of each section. Unlike some other goal-setting plans I have tried, these action steps were concise enough to be undertaken in a reasonable time frame while still offering enough information to be helpful. Here are some of the specific things I appreciated in the book: 1) Excellent research--I loved reading about current research on each topic. This gave plenty of support to Michael's recommendations, moving them beyond the realm of simple suggestion and into best practice. 2) Lots of examples--Examples help bring abstract concepts down into the tangible realm of daily practice. Michael not only tells you what he recommends, but provides examples of how to do it. 3) Planning templates--The planning templates in the back of the book, while not intended as a full planner, still provide a good jumping off point for launching goal setting strategy. The book includes lots of references to Michael's other work, including books and seminars you can participate in. Take this with a grain of salt. It's good to know these other resources are out there if you want them, but they may not be for everyone. Overall, a good strategy resource. If you've never done strategy planning before, this book will give you a solid framework. If you already have a system you like, you'll still come away with some insights to help you tweak what you're doing and make it more effective. I plan to review this annually."}], "description": "We all want to live a life that matters. We all want to reach our full potential. But too often we find ourselves overwhelmed by the day-to-day.
