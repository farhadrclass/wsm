I was listening to this one in the car and honestly only finished it to continue screaming obscenities every few minutes because of the absurdity of some of the dialogue and the idiocy of the characters. I mean..the characters were super dumb. Dense. IQ impaired. Which made me not like them.And the narrator had the creepiest fake Southern accented falsetto when he did Lexie's voice that he made her sound even less intelligent than some of her dialogue. Truly this was a groundbreakingly terrible novel! I think it deserves some kind of award...Sparks might be running out of steam, because this novel was pure drivel. And if I had more free time on my hands I'd write him a letter to tell him how much I didn't appreciate the ridiculous number of \"way down south\" stereotypes that he put into Boone Creek - I've lived in NC for a long time, and I've never met anyone named Jed, I don't know any taxidermists who only grunt instead of speaking (and are ordained ministers as a side job?? - ok, I don't know any taxidermists PERIOD), NONE of the men I know dress in flannel shirts, and I've NEVER heard of a mayor who is so very involved in the personal lives of the (not wealthy) people in his town!

The three main events in the book are:1. Jeremy and Lexie are getting married, but someone is trying to break them up. 2. Their baby could die or be born with a deformity. 3. Ta-da! Neither of those happen! Lexie just dies in childbirth instead. But her death had nothing to do with the the threats to their relationship or the disease the baby didn't get, it was just a freak accident. So by the end, the story seemed totally disjointed, like he's just throwing in anything tragic to keep the women of America in tears.

In At First Sight, Jeremy and Lexie are preparing for their upcoming wedding shortly after Jeremy's move down to Boone Creek, N.C. to be with her. On top of the wedding stress, the couple is also trying to keep it under wraps that Lexie is pregnant.The book follows Jeremy and Lexie through the pregnancy, the subsequent purchase of a house, and Jeremy's writer's block that doesn't seem to be going away. When Jeremy begins to receive suspicious emails from an anonymous sender, the relationship goes through more twists and turns.Sparks rounds the book out with former characters: Lexie's psychic grandmother, the mayor of Boone Creek who always seems to know everyone's business, and the taxidermist/hotel employee whose wedding gift is a stuffed wild boar. The quirks and predicaments will keep readers laughing, but the subsequent happenings in the story make this book as much of a tearjerker as The Notebook.

I didn't know Sparks had it in him. I usually love his novels...they're easy, feel-good reads. But this one, ulgh, where do I start?The characters (especially Lexie) were SO annoying through the whole thing. Lexie wasn't willing to sacrifice anything to be with Jeremy...he had to move to Boone Creek, in the middle of nowhere, and do everything else on her terms. Bought the house she wanted, the renovations she wanted, in the city she wanted etc...and meanwhile, she didn't even seem grateful that he gave up everything to be with her (even his best friend who thought he was making a mistake in marrying her so fast). And then to top it off, she kept LYING to him!! She kept sneaking off to see...what's his face (I can't even remember his name...Rodney was it?) and then when Jeremy confronted her about it, not only did she try lying, but she tried manipulating him by turning it around saying it was his fault she had to sneak around! For pete's sake, she was HOLDING HANDS with an ex-boyfriend and then lying about it, I think anyone would be ticked off and suspicious! Not to mention, Rodney and Lexie's best friend, Rachel, were having relationship problems because Rachel thinks Rodney's still in love with Lexie, so what does Lexie do? She tries to \"help\" by consoling Rodney (ie: holding his hand, going over alone to his place to comfort him and listen) and then lies about it to Jeremy. Cow, cow, cow. Maybe try staying away from Rodney so that him and Rachel could work things out? How Rachel could stand being her friend was beyond me. Nor do I recall Lexie helping Rachel when she fought with Rodney, but she was more than willing to offer a shoulder for Rodney to cry on. Anyways, despite all that, Jeremy still stood by Lexie's side AND gave her the wedding SHE always wanted (of which he wasn't even allowed to invite his entire family in order to keep it small). This story did not make me feel like I was reading about true love, rather I felt like I was reading about blind desperation. Needless to say I will not be reading this book again.

First of all, Jeremy and Lexie meet, have sex, become pregnant, and get engaged...all within six weeks. He doesn't know her middle name, who her friends are, or about a dozen other things you should know about someone when claiming they are the love of your life. He drops his entire life and moves from NYC to Boone Creek to live with Lexie because she refuses to live in NYC. Which isn't a shock considering the rest of the book depicts Lexie as a self-centered brat. She sneaks around behind his back then gets pissed when he calls her on it. She forces him into buying some rundown house that nearly bleeds him dry during renovations. She takes him on an extravagant shopping spree for baby stuff. Oh, and let's not forget the sportscar he'd saved for and lusted after his entire life. I could've handle some of this if Lexie had actually put a dime toward any of this herself. Nope, Jeremy footed the bill for the entire thing.Then this mysterious email pops up and (kind of) threatens to derail everything. But when you find out who's behind the email, you're left with a \"are you kidding me?\" and not in a good way. Later on Jeremy gets into a fight with his best friend Alvin and ends the friendship--over one fight. While I can't say I condone what Alvin did, his heart was in the right place and he didn't deserve to lose his best friend (although, there was a part of me that thought Alvin was better off with Jeremy). Yet, Lexie has a fight with her bff Rachel and they stay friends. (Lexie gets her way yet again...*insert eye roll*)The ending of At First Sight was typical for a Nicholas Sparks novel in that he simply cannot allow his characters to ride off into the sunset. The ending was not unexpected and didn't leave me with any real emotion for the characters.

I hated the constant fighting...how old are these 2? It's called communication.2. Alvin...you pig. and lame.3. The ABS...needless stress and making it seem just too dramatic.4. Killing Lexie? REALLY!?! After she grew up not having a mother, you do the same thing to her daughter? Really, in my opinion this was a cop-out. I really despeised this ending and it actually made me angry.

En lo positivo... me quedo con que Sparks mantiene su voz propia, esa que hace que una novela suya sea reconocible entre mil. Y poco m\u00e1s.En lo negativo, empecemos: la traducci\u00f3n y la edici\u00f3n del libro deja mucho que desear. Adem\u00e1s de algunas faltas de ortograf\u00eda, hay una repetici\u00f3n de expresiones que se hace insufrible (\"ni tan solo\", por ejemplo, aparece constantemente, y ni siquiera es una expresi\u00f3n natural en espa\u00f1ol). Y hay errores de continuidad que son demasiado fuertes para que no me sienta un poco estafada por haber invertido dinero en este libro. Un ejemplo: \"el 28 de abril firmar\u00e9 el contrato de la nueva casa; despu\u00e9s llegar\u00e1 mi despedida de soltero y, unas cuentas semanas despu\u00e9s, la gran boda, el 6 de mayo\". Caramba, s\u00ed que cunden 8 d\u00edas en el universo Sparks; dan incluso para que pasen varias semanas. En fin...Pero nada de esto me parece esto lo m\u00e1s grave. El problema es que el se\u00f1or Sparks necesita urgentemente un viaje al 2017. A lo mejor as\u00ed no construir\u00eda una novela basada constantemente en t\u00f3picos sobre hombres y mujeres. Cosas como que las mujeres siempre buscamos un hombre con buena posici\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica porque va en nuestro ADN o una constante ridiculizaci\u00f3n de las molestias y \"antojos\" de una mujer durante el embarazo. Son solo dos ejemplos, pero es constante en la novela. Las mujeres somos pobrecillas que necesitamos el apoyo de un hombre; ellos son machotes que se mueren del agobio ante la idea del amor. Sumemos a esto escenas de celos sin sentido, personajes femeninos que rompen con sus amistades porque, claro, l\u00f3gicamente, c\u00f3mo va su prometido a aceptar que tenga amigos chicos... y mierdas varias m\u00e1s.Nunca hago cr\u00edticas tan duras como esta, pero lo acab\u00e9 hace cinco d\u00edas y todav\u00eda me hierve la sangre."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742297-sara", "userReview": "I was kind of disappointed with this book.

The anxiety and fear relating with starting a new life, marriage, kids and parenting. Though things and events sometimes seems to get slower and tedious, but I like his way of describing feelings and emotions simply. Despite these I had issues with this novel...

It puts you through a relationship from hell with no rewards in sight even if you manage to reach the back cover. This couple\u2019s courtship and marriage is a dispiriting affair peppered with doubts, lies and Lexie-laid emotional minefields that no intelligent man (as Jeremy was portrayed to be) would have tolerated for 10 minutes, never mind 277 pages. Even the poor old baby that the two managed to conceive during one of their few better moments didn\u2019t escape the misery that casts its shadow over all of this book. Threatened when in the supposed safety and comfort of Lexie\u2019s womb, doomed to be labeled a killer when it pops out, then inhabited by the restless spirit of its dead mother, this baby has been dealt one tough hand.

This book was atrocious. I felt no connection to the characters at all. I am usually a huge fan of Sparks and his stories - Safe Haven and A Walk To Remember are two of my favorites and they will always be up there when it comes to great love stories. This..? What a load of tripe. First of all, all of the characters are densely stupid. So much so that at times you will feel like you are a Harvard graduate when you're reading it. The mayor is REALLY, REALLY, REALLY involved in everyone's personal lives. It feels so fake and forced- what mayor knows everything about EVERYONE in his town? That was a little weird. Then there's the fact that Lexie acts like a girl who doesn't know what relationships are. Jeremy voices his concerns with her 'sneaking' around and seeing another guy (even if it's not a romantic type of see- it still isn't right for her to do) and she gets mad at him and makes HIM feel bad. Even though he wasn't the one sneaking around. Go figure. And then when it comes to Jeremy, he's a sex obsessed grown man stuck in a college mind. All he talks about is Lexie and how pretty she is, etc. Though they are having a baby neither one seems really sure that they are invested in the whole process - it's like they don't know what having a baby entails. The relationship felt wrong from the get-go and the whole time I was reading this I was silently rooting for them to separate and find people they are more compatible with. Of course that didn't happen. Then the ending happens and you're just kind of like..\"...really?\" Basically, this is NOT in Sparks' top five. Or even ten. I used to wonder why all of his books hadn't been made into movies and well, this book gave me the reason. If you're like me and wanted to go back and read all of his earlier novels since you've read his more recent ones, save yourself the trouble and don't even bother. There are just too many other great books that deserve your attention instead."}, {"userName": "jack", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39426341-jack", "userReview": "I really want to hurt Nicholas Sparks bc I'm crying on Valentine's Day but i wouldn't stoop to that level.

So just disregard any complaints or comments I've made below, concerning lack of details. Originally, my rating for this book was 2.5 stars but I couldn't do that here so I rounded it off. Nicholas Sparks is a great author, no doubt about that. But here's the thing. His books have exactly the same plot but only with different characters; and twists that would seem to make each of his books distinguishable. The first few minutes I read this book, I already knew what would happen. See, that's the problem with Nick's books; this one, at least. It can get too cliche. But meanwhile after reading another few chapters, it was giving me a slight change of what I thought about the forthcoming. It just kept going like that until I was done reading the book. Thus, this read was unput-downable; neither in a bad nor a good way. I was rather desperate to just finish the whole thing. And when I'd arrived to that, I wasn't completely awestruck. But somehow felt a little satisfied.Damn. A nice scene just showed up from Glee.The next section could contain some spoilers? xD All my life, this is what I fear the most. To be in Jeremy Marsh's shoes. I would really have loved to read more details about how he met Lexie 'cause this book had failed in that prospect. This was more of retelling what both the characters had felt and how they were handling these trust issues and a couple of \"love problems\" if you wanna call it, which didn't seem to have a relevance at all to the outcome! Jeremy got divorced from his first marriage because he wasn't capable of bearing a child. With that idea, he can go hit as many girls as he wants. But then after discovering that Lexie (who was probably the last girl he had hooked up with) was pregnant, a miracle, I know, he then made these decisions which includes marrying her and moving in to her town. For the sake of the baby, I supposed. But as the book made it seem so, he was really in love with her and the other way around; which didn't convince me at all. Until their marriage. That was the time when I was finally invested in their characters; but not completely. On the minus side, I thought this book was a little bit all over the place. It felt like some parts shouldn't be there and I completely had no idea what they're supposed to mean and if they even have to do with anything. Those kind of stuffs. For instance, before even arriving to their marriage, Jeremy was receiving these e-mails which ought to break him and his fiancee apart. After dealing with that, the dilemma then felt kinda pointless after reading the resolution part of the plot. Some dialogues too, I thought, were less realistic for my taste. I thought they were cartoon-ish while I was playing the scenes in my mind. I have to say though that the depth of the conflict of the plot wasn't heavy and thick enough. Perhaps not until the labor. There's just something about death that makes you teary-eyed. (No book has ever beaten my sobs in TFiOS yet. Just sayin' ha-ha) Also, along the storyline, some scenarios were getting very stupid and dull. I don't even know if I should give a crap about them or what 'cause the characters were somewhat giving these idiotic lines.But yeah, as I said somewhere above, I was a bit satisfied by the ending. I was surprised (didn't force it, trust me) and I liked the feeling after reading the epilogue. And I loved how the title fitted in the story. Not exactly what I had in mind so overall, good."}, {"userName": "Brianne Durrant", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12735265-brianne-durrant", "userReview": "I enjoyed \u201cAt First Sight\u201d. This book is a great example of how two couples who hardly know each other, manage to make their relationship work. Jeremy, who is a journalist, travels to Boones Creek, South Carolina to write his column on \"the Mysterious Lights.\" As he was doing his column, he met Lexie, who talked about her dead parents and visiting \"the Mysterious Lights.\" In the two weeks he was there, he fell in love with her and decided to propose to her. Instead of coming back to New York with just a column, he came back with a fianc\u00e9 as well. This causes a huge conflict between Alvin, Jeremy\u2019s best friend, and him. When Jeremy tells him that he plans to move in with Lexie, he thinks they are moving excessively fast. Then he goes to Boones Creek, where their friendship becomes strained and Alvin does something that risks Jeremy\u2019s friendship and his relationship with Lexie.Before he moved to Boones Creek, Jeremy was more into fashionable attire and loved to do something different each day. When he moved there however, he becomes more relaxed, has less of a humor and wears plaid shirts, which is something he would have never done before.This setting first takes place in New York in the first chapter, and then the rest is Boones Creek, South Carolina, five years in the past. The theme is trust. Throughout this book, Jeremy lacks trust in Lexie and often times, their arguments are centered on lack of trust.
