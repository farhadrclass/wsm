It must be understood that this is purely a political history. There is no effort to touch social, economic or demographic, literary or architectural history. The other GoodsRead reviewers who complained of the lack of maps, pictures and other illustrations are highly justified. With very little trouble, this excellent political history could have been transformed into a more informative book for the amateur reader."}, {"userName": "Bryn Hammond", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7224461-bryn-hammond", "userReview": "I doubt I can be objective on this book. It was my first full-scale history of the steppe; my first real acquaintance with the life of Jenghiz Khan, too (as spelt in Grousset). First published 1939; in print for its 'majestic sweep and grandeur... the intellectual grasp of Grousset's original masterwork'... 'uniquely great'. That's from the forward to the 1970 edition in English, and I might just end my comments there.It is a sweep of steppe history, and captured my imagination: his descriptions of steppe art; his portrait of Jenghiz Khan, and the latter's similarity to Attila. I met Jenghiz Khan here, and perhaps that's why I can't stand most biographies of him - because he's as Grousset paints him, at bottom, to me. It's a striking portrait and one not easily overwritten, if Grousset's came first.Since he wrote in 1939 he has outdated knowledge and of course you have to read further. But for that 'majestic sweep' and steppe history seen as a follow-on whole, for his brave attempts to characterize such as Attila and Jenghiz, and not least for his open mind and sympathy with nomad peoples - I'm so glad that by mere accident, I started here."}, {"userName": "Jeremy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5417002-jeremy", "userReview": "A big ambitious book that seeks to describe two thousand years of history of a vast area in only 542 pages! It was dense writing, but surprisingly readable. Not that I absorbed everything. But I found if I kept reading the story would wash over me. I can't tell you much about most of the historical characters whose lives are recounted in the book, but the book taught me a lot about the overall history of Central Asia.There were some problems and/or oddities with the book. It was written in the 1930s and at places it would show its age. The book used the word \"orientalist\" without any negative connotation. Grousset seemed to assume that ethnic groups and races had certain inherent characteristics that he talks about much more openly than a modern author would. He used a few turns of phrases that would not be used today because they have a sexual connotation (e.g. numerous times he writes that some military leader \"took [his opponent] from the rear\" meaning his military outflanked him and won the battle).There's also a question about how much of the book holds up. For example, early in the book Grousset talks about the Hsiung-Nu, a Central Asian nomadic people who attacked the Chinese empire in the first century A.D. According to Chinese sources, the Chinese fought the Hsiung-Nu off, and they exited Chinese history after being driven into Central Asia to the West of China. Three hundred years later, the Huns invade Europe from Western Asia. Grousset claimed they are the same people, having traveled across Asia during those three hundred years, passing through an area where no one was recording history. It's an interesting idea, so I googled around and found out that the theory has not held up very well since this book was written. Grousset makes a whole lot of claims throughout the book. Obviously, I did not check into most of them. But the questionable Hsiung-Nu-Huns claim made me wonder what else in the book might not have held up.Grousset is also very conscious of which groups are Persian, Mongol, Turkic or Chinese. But he refers to both the Kipchaks and the Uzbeks as Mongols, when in fact they are both Turkic. Again, what else did he get wrong?But these are mostly quibbles when you consider the book as a whole. The above questions don't cut into his overall thesis, that the history of Asia was governed by a cycle up until the modern era. Settled cultures would be periodically invaded by nomadic people. Sometimes the settled people would fight them off, but the nomads had certain advantages (nomads tended to be tougher because they came from a harsher environment, and settled people had more stuff to defend) and a lot of times they would win and conquer the settled civilization. Once they were in charge, however, the nomads would be seduced by the comforts of civilized life and adopt the culture of the conquered people. Then they would becomes the settled culture, ready for the next nomadic invasion who sometimes turned out to be their distant cousins. Grousset fills the book with examples, of Mongols and Turks going from the barbarian hordes threatening Persia and China, to establishing dynasties that became Chinese or Persian."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10107964-christy", "userReview": "His biases are showing, and I would really love to see someone re-translate with a knowledge of all the material released form Mongolia since the fall of the USSR, however I still give it four stars for its thoroughness on covering the topic.Note: I skimmed this for a research paper, focusing on the late 13th century and early 14th century."}, {"userName": "K\u00fcbra Ya\u011fmur", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36997724-k-bra-ya-mur", "userReview": "Osmanl\u0131 \u0130mparatorlu\u011fu Tarihi Ek Okumas\u0131 #2\u00d6SYM ile ringe \u00e7\u0131kacakm\u0131\u015f gibi hissediyorum kendimi.\u0130stekleri kadar tarih sorabilirler."}, {"userName": "Mehmet Akif  Koc", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21811361-mehmet-akif-koc", "userReview": "B\u00fcy\u00fck Frans\u0131z \u015earkiyat\u00e7\u0131 Ren\u00e9 Grousset'nin 1930'lar\u0131n sonunda kaleme ald\u0131\u011f\u0131 ve uzun y\u0131llar \u00f6nce Prof. Halil \u0130nalc\u0131k'\u0131n terc\u00fcme edip T\u00fcrk Tarih Kurumu'nun \"Stepler \u0130mparatorlu\u011fu: Attila, Cengiz Han, Timur\" ad\u0131yla yay\u0131nlad\u0131\u011f\u0131 kitap, Asya steplerinin g\u00f6\u00e7ebe halklar\u0131n\u0131n tarihi a\u00e7\u0131s\u0131ndan bir ba\u015fyap\u0131t niteli\u011finde.

For a translation and for an older volume written by a well-known scholar of his time as an academic history of this under-researched portion of the world, this book is fairly readable and interesting. In places, to be sure, it will come across to the modern reader as dry or overly academic, however, it remains perhaps the very best one-volume work on its topic and despite more recent research in Central Asian studies, no one can match the overall depth and scope of Grousset's efforts. In places, as was common to writers of the 19th and early 20th century in academic works, Grousset fails to make all his details clear, as when he desribes the artwork of wall-hangings that depict animals engaged in wars and other anthropomorphic tasks, he doesn't quite make clear whether these are in fact animals depicted as warriors or men and only if you know the art history of these objects already, does the whole narrative quite make sense. I am sure in other places in the book where I lacked previous expertise on the topic, I was confused by instances where the author simply did not flesh out his topic as well as he could have, but you've got to also consider the sweeping geographic area, social groups, and time periods covered in this book. Again, whatever it lacks though, it makes up for via its comprehensive and deep insight into a vast region that is unfairly little-known to most Westerners and also lacking from serious English-language historiography . . . even the Russian scholarship of the region in fact is lacking. That said, this book helps the reader formulate a strong basis for further study of Central Asian history."}, {"userName": "Keeko", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2459021-keeko", "userReview": "I like the review of the person who wrote it's like trying to get a drink from a fire hose.
