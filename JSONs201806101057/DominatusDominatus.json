I had trouble putting it down. The timeline of the story includes the events of this country and what the current administration (Obama) is doing to us then goes on to illustrate the possible events to come. Although it is a piece of fiction, the story line is very good and the picture is clear on where these happenings and changes to our country will eventually lead us to. I'm recommending this book to all my friends. \"The United States is no more\u2026and hidden away within the isolated wilderness of Alaska\u2019s interior resides the tiny community of Dominatus. There lives a small but diverse group of people seeking out simple lives of personal liberty and freedom, but who now face termination under the oppressive and deadly regime of the New United Nations. They will fight and if need be, die for an America that once was. An America before being swallowed up by the monster of tyrannical global governance. An America before the mandates. An America before the government drone killings. An America before Obama....\""}, {"userName": "Robert Tompsett", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19296833-robert-tompsett", "userReview": "If you read Orwell's 1984, then you need to read this! The year is 2037, The United States is gone, The American flag has been modified to display the United Nations symbol where the stars once appeared. The US is now call the NUN - New United Nations. Obama is now the \"world leader\". Drones monitor our everyday movement. Jails and Prisons are now call \"Re-Education facilities. Churches are boarded up, Firearms non existent. History books erased any knowledge of the pre existent United States. You are forced to the NUN ways, or you die by controlled poisons from the food you eat or the medicines prescribed. An outpost (Dominatus) in Alaska is the only hope for a few hundred holdouts determined to get the United States back.This is all fiction in the mind of D.W. Ulsterman, but the potential reality is a real mine boggling wakeup.Bunch of Hog Wash!!!!"}, {"userName": "Jack", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22540604-jack", "userReview": "A fun read full of Americana. It takes the time to remind us what we lose everyday by sacrificing our constitutional rights to a lying self serving Government. The simple act of smoking a cigarette has become filthy, shameful and evil, Why is that? School kid expelled for making a play gun out of a pop tart, Really? The slow peeling away of American culture under the guise of Fairness, safety and ecology. When the truth is, the evil in the book, like the Obama administration seeks enslavement through faux protection. Its premise is plausible, it's characters likable and believable. It's not Clancy or Flynn, it's more like Glenn Beck meets Mark Twain. I liked it, thank you Mr. Ulsterman"}, {"userName": "Trudy Matus", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18566337-trudy-matus", "userReview": "This is fiction that hits very close to home and, unlike 1984 when I read it all those years ago, seems eerily plausible and disturbingly likely to occur soon.

Believe it or not, the ideas written here are not original. In 2007, a right-wing university student told me a similar prediction, only it was Hilary Clinton was going to become president, she was going to appoint Bill Clinton to the UN, Bill would become Secretary General of the UN, and the Clinton dynasty would destroy all freedom in the US. So, the author merely changed the names.I found it most amusing when the author put the blame and evilness of the patriot act on Obama in 2009. In actual fact, the patriot act was rammed through congress by the Bush whiteHouse in 2002, shortly after 09/11/2001.Oh, and lets not forget, there are two interesting things about the Alaskan community. First, they have a wonderful barter system with quite strong socialist leanings. Second, they are living on the largess of a wealthy man. It seems as though they cannot survive on their own; contrary to what they wish to delude themselves into believing. Don't waste your time with this one unless you are one of the nutty fringe right."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3467154-kim", "userReview": "I finished this book a few days ago and find myself thinking about it still. It's a bit disturbing, particularly if you're not an Obama fan. The idea of Obama ruling the world is - something I cannot quite put into words. Quite definitely - SCARY. So many questionable experiences have followed him and he continues to get away with it without question and that makes something like this much more realistic. People are entirely too trusting - and too lazy - to ask questions and demand answers for some of these things. Crazy. And the republicans are the enemy??? They are only trying to protect us."}, {"userName": "Val Wilkerson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157228-val-wilkerson", "userReview": "The editing was very bad, hence 4 stars instead of 5.

The unfiltered poppycock is hell bent for the conspiracy theorists in waiting. More than that, it disgraces the many veterans who lined up to protect the USA without question, some killed, some wounded, and nearly all with huge personal sacrifice. No doubt about the overt slam at the only black president who faced his \u201cCommander in Chief\u201d duties on scale equal any other, including those named by this dimwitted hack of a writer. He even plays the race card openly; the only blacks acceptable had to meet the sieve of Dominatus trash logic, weather a black doctor or a childhood playmate. I was sure this was a \u201cspoof\u201d when I first started reading; it was written in the style of Faulkner\u2019s retarded character who could communicate only on the guttural level.

I found it quite an enjoyable read. It is fast paced action thriller set in the future with a loss of freedoms in the USA as a result of alliances with the United Nations.

If it was any better, I probably would have just stopped reading, but I pushed through to the bitter end so I wouldn't feel bad about writing a poor review.I was interested in reading this after hearing it was a modern distopian novel in the vein of 1984 or Fahrenheit 451. It wasn't thought as provoking as either of them, nor as believable. They spent time crafting stories that showed the dangers of totalitarian governments and total media control by the state. They don't try to say that they have the answer to the government, but address the dangers of where things can go when the government gets too strong.Ulsterman, by contrast, spends his time arguing for a Libertarian ideal against a strawman version of the Obama administration. It was heavy handed and poorly written. Obama and the New United Nations have take everything away from the people (health care choices, entertainment, food, drink, etc.) and seemingly replaced it with nothing but more restrictions and media cover-ups. How did the citizenry get to the point of putting up with this? We don't really find out, just told that people went along with it. Bradbury had the sense to show how the government controlled the people by feeding them vapid entertainment while censoring anything counter to the party line. The first two thirds of the book is exposition via a series of interviews with various characters: \"America was all great until XXX. You know about XXX? Let me tell you about it and how it all comes back to Obama and his cabal trying to ruin America by crushing the populace. Aren't we great because we don't do that.\"Just telling me that the other guy is wrong doesn't make you right, and the book reads more like a hit piece on Obama rather than a thorough treatise on Libertarianism. It just got tiresome reading about how awesome the 100-person society of Dominatus is and reminiscing about a highly idealized American history, and then in the next breath, a vilification of Obama for adding more and more restrictions on liberty (and once berating him for removing government required recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, because freedom is great, unless is the freedom to not say the Pledge). By the time there's actual action in the story, it's so formulaic, there wasn't any surprise. Want to guess who wins the inevitable battle between good and evil, against all odds (and bad military tactics)?Likewise, the characters lacked any depth. The residents of Dominatus are all good old freedom loving Americans who want to live without any government involvement; the New United Nations folks are sadistic, murder hungry maniacs who want power for power's sake and enjoy crushing people under their heel.Brutally heavy-handed, lacking depth, and read like he was angry at Obama.

The writing was good, I expect nothing less from this author, but it got a tad long-winded through the first 90% of the story. After the ice pick scene, though, I wasn't sure what to expect next and that made it interesting. Good reading for the YA audience-it might prepare them for where this world is headed if they allow it. I'm hoping the next in the series (Tumultuous) kicks it up a notch.
