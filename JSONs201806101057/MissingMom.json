This book follows Nikki Eaton as a self-absorbed, single-but-dating-a-married-man wild child through the discovery of her mother's murder and the year of grieving and discovery afterwards. Sure, she's a flawed character, but I still found her sympathetic and compelling - I also appreciate authors that paint realistic portraits of people and can still manage poignancy. People are complicated. I liked Nikki's voice, and identified somehow with her, and a tragedy which I hope desperately never to identify with. I also believe Nikki had to be the selfish, lonely, flawed character she was in order to show the growth she makes over one year, and the maturity which comes along with learning about our mothers' pasts, and missing them, and choosing to respect their life by emulating the good qualities you might not have appreciated while they were alive."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32553942-thomas", "userReview": "\u0392\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u0388\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b4\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2. \u039c\u03b5 \u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03b2\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \u03b7 Nikki \u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b5\u03af \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c7\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2. \u03a3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 150 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03b9. \u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03b7 Joyce Carol Oates \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03b4\u03c9\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0' \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9."}, {"userName": "Anne  (Booklady) Molinarolo", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3615945-anne-booklady-molinarolo", "userReview": "I picked up MISSING MOM a few months after my own mother passed away, and put it down. Her death was too fresh for me to read Joyce Carol Oates tribute to her own mother. Looking at the different reviews of the novel, many readers say that this is a departure for Oates. I have no clue, since I\u2019ve never read her before; but I was still intrigued by MISSING MOM and finally read it.Nikki Eaton is a reporter for the Beacon. She is hip. She wears her multi- colored hair short as her skirts are. She is the black sheep of the family. She isn\u2019t married and is having a lurid affair with a married man. She is 31 years old; young enough to find her mother, Gwen, old fashioned and tends to ignore her. \u201d\"I didn't visit home often. I tried not to feel guilty: Mom tried not to make me feel guilty. But a kind of constriction came over me when I returned, an invisible clamp across my chest...When will you get married, Nikki? When will you have children...Without family, what is there?\"Nikki soon learns. Her mother is murdered. Nikki is determined to find out who killed her mother and brought so much hurt upon her and her sister, Clare. She grows both in character and in her love for Gwen. \u201dMom had been strong; Mom had not been weak and self pitying. But I was made to realize now that grief would come in waves and there would be wave after wave, there was not one big wave to be overcome and endured.\" Gwen \u201cFeather\u201d Easton is rediscovered by this black sheep through these waves of grief and police investigation. She is much more than Nikki ever thought, and is amazed as she learns about her grandmother and father\u2019s death. She finally understands Gwen\u2019s need for perfection, albeit an outside appearance one. Oates is brilliant. Who could write such a poignant coming of age story through a literary mystery? I hazard to guess, not too many authors. Though we readers grieve with the two Eaton sisters, we celebrate the life of their sweet mother as we follow the police investigation and eventual trial. Her descriptions of grief and its processes are on the money and would be very difficult for anyone who just lost her/his own mom. But when you can, I highly recommend this wonderful literary novel."}, {"userName": "Kristy Buzbee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/961188-kristy-buzbee", "userReview": "Missing Mom was a very emotional book - in a good way. The main character Nikki is a thirty-something, independent woman who thinks she really has no need for her mom, and her mom's attempts to stay in touch and stay connected are just a hassle. But when she loses her mother in an unexpected and horrible way, she realizes just how important her mother really was. This book chronicles the first year after her mother's death, and how she (and her other family members) cope with tragedy. It takes on some really emotional and difficult topics, without portraying them in a way that makes it too hard to read."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/609046-emily", "userReview": "Gosh i just could NOT get into this one!

What nobody\u2019s else would know or care about. That, when they are gone, goes with them.\u2019 (p. 397)If you follow me, you\u2019ve probably heard me mention Joyce Carol Oates a couple of times or more. She is one of my favorite authors. I\u2019m not only impressed with her abilities as a writer, her way of using language, punctuation, italics as emphasis and much more but also her productivity and her constant high writing standard. I\u2019ve never read a bad book by her. She writes books that are not quite as good as her best ones (We were the Mulvaneys, Blonde) but they are still in a completely different league than a lot og book by other authors.That said, this is not one of her best. Mother, Missing is the story of Nikki Eaton and her sister who tragically loose their mother and how they deal with this loss in very different ways.Nikki and her sister Claire are both in their 30s, living their own lives. Claire lives with her husband and children in the same city as the sisters grew up in while Nikki has moved away and is living the independent (and selfish) life as a reporter. She is the \u2018black sheep\u2019, dating an older man, coloring her hair purple, wearing tight skimpy clothes.After a Mother\u2019s Day dinner at their mother\u2019s home, a couple of days go by without the sisters being able to get in touch with their mother. Finally, Nikki drives back home to check on her and finds her killed in the garage.What happens then is a mix between the sisters dealing with the aftermath of their mother\u2019s sudden and unexpected death as well as flashbacks to times before.The few pages of Nikki walking through the house looking for her mother, are masterfully written. The suspense builds and builds and builds. Even though you know Nikki will find her mother dead, you are just sitting on the edge of your seat, reading as fast as you can to find out what has happened. I find it so impressive when an author can grasp you like this even though you know what\u2019s in store.Unfortunately, the rest of the book is not quite as good. It is still a great book and I like the flawed character Nikki as the main narrator. She makes bad choices \u2013 and sometimes she even knows it herself. She\u2019s struggling and she\u2019s hurting \u2013 and she\u2019s trying. I like how the novel shows how the death of a parent makes you question your life, your priorities, your values, just about everything. And also how parents often don\u2019t seem like real people, real human beings, to their children. And sometimes, it\u2019s only after they are dead and gone, you realize that they were so much more than just your parent and how they led a whole life before you yourself became a part of their life and history and created a new, shared, history.It\u2019s also very much a book about sibling relations. How one moment you wonder whether you have anything in common with your sibling(s) and if you will ever speak again when your parents have died \u2013 and the next moment you nudge each other and share a private joke and remember all the history you and your sibling(s) have together. And how when your parents die, your sibling(s) are the only ones who share your history. Both the sisters in this book make changes after their mother\u2019s sudden death, some just for a while, some to stay.Joyce Carol Oates nails these family relations so perfectly. If you have parents and/or siblings, you will have experienced some of these situations and emotions, the characters show in this novel.But still, despite Oates\u2019 wonderful eye for these important relationships and her great writing, this is not one of her best novels. It\u2019s still a good book and I think it\u2019s worth reading. However, if you are only going to read a few of Oates novels, this doesn\u2019t have to be one of them.I don\u2019t want to end this review on a negative note because I really liked reading it but I hold it up against Oates\u2019 own standard which is so very high and that\u2019s the reason why it only receives three stars. I\u2019ll let Oates\u2019 end this review with her own words, a quote from the book. Maybe this will do the book more justice.Last time you see someone and you don\u2019t know it will be the last time. And all that you know now, if only you\u2019d known then. But you didn\u2019t know, and now it\u2019s too late. And you tell yourself How could I have known, I could not have known. You tell yourself.\u2019 (p. 3)"}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "I lost my mom in 2009. She and I were mostly at odds for many years. Somewhere in my 40s we began to reconcile. She stopped being so critical of me and I began to see her good points. Near the end of her life she needed 24 hour care and wished to remain at home. I honored that wish, left my job, husband, and home, and so spent the last three months of her life by her side. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. ( My wonderful husband was supportive of my choice.)So I related to Missing Mom in a big way. Two sisters must deal with their widowed mother's gruesome death. They have never gotten along but it is the rebellious, free-spirited daughter who comes to stay at the family home, sort through the relics of the past, and deal with her loss.In the process, she learns that her apparently sainted mother had a secret and tragic past. The woman who she knew as mom was practically a created personality who bore little resemblance to the child and teenager she had been before marriage. Learning the truth about both their parents' lives, the sisters change and find their own true selves.I found this book somehow lighter than most of the novels I have read by JCO. Of course, lighter for her is still dark compared to many other authors, but there is a tenderness she does not usually show. I wondered about her relationship with her own parents.It was easy to read, it made me laugh and cry, and I recommend it for female readers who have lost their mom, especially moms with whom they have had their troubles."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2881069-maureen", "userReview": "The only other book I've read by Joyce Carol Oates was the depressing tome We Were the Mulvaneys. I thought this was going to follow in the same genre but it did improve on reading.The story deals with the unexpected violent death (two days after Mother's Day) of middle aged mom, Gwen Eaton, as seen through the eyes of her immature, selfish 31 year old youngest daughter Nikki, an independent journalist who freelances with a local paper. I found Nikki's ruminations to be grating and boring at times but then realized with the passage of time, Nikki's character was growing and maturing. The saddest lines in the book are Last time you see someone and you don't know it will be the last time. And all thatyou know now, if only you'd known then.But you didn't know, and now it's too late. And you tell yourself How could I have known, I could not have known.Nikki and her older sister, Claire, struggle with the loss of their mom in their lives, each dealing with the grief in their own way. Each seems to go off the deep end at some point. It seems that losing your mom this way would send anyone off the deep end. Nikki is involved is a relationship with an older married man, Wally Szallas, which her mother vehemently disapproved. She moves into her mom's deserted house with her mom's cat and carefully goes through every item and relives memories of her mom. She begins walking in her mom's shoes. She begins to see her mom as a person.Nikki also discovers that the loss of her mother affects all the people her mom interacted with weekly. Nikki resents sharing her grief with them. She spurns all solicitations for help or advice, from her sister to her mom's best friend to relatives to the case detective and other minor acquaintances. But she seems to learn a little from each person gradually. Her blunt embarrassing cousin Lucille seems to set her on the correct path in her own straightforward way.

This book was recommended to me, and I read through it quickly. I felt it really pulled you in and made you kind of feel as though you were living the experience through the characters. As a young person who has lost a parent, I could identify with what the author was trying to put forth, but also embraced that the grieving process is very different for each person. This was apparently in the book by the various people in the book who recounted their own personal experience with the departed one. It was my first Joyce Carol Oates book, and it was a little too warm fuzzy for me, but it did make me think. I suppose the most lasting impression it left on me was that I want to appreciate those I love and take care of them while I have the chance, and to try to remember not to lose yourself in your own head and life. As the main character shows, I think if you do this, you rob the people who love you the chance to take care of you, be a part of your life, and ultimately, for you to take care of them."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "This book describes the life of a typical American family and how they learn to mourn their loving parents.

Un giorno, in un modo tutto tuo, sar\u00e0 anche la tua storia) mi ha messo cos\u00ec tanta ansia e magone che non sono riuscita ad affrontare serenamente il libro; s\u00ec lo so, infantile da morire, ma \u00e8 una cosa pi\u00f9 forte di me ;_;Ho deciso di riprovarci con la consapevolezza che avrei comunque avuto una facile via di fuga se fosse diventato troppo opprimente.. La realt\u00e0 si \u00e8 dimostrata tutto il contrario: non c'\u00e8 niente in questo libro e non \u00e8 riuscito - nel bene e nel male - a trasmettermi nulla.Mi aspettavo che tra Nikki, narratrice e figli ribelle, e Gwen ci fossero molti conflitti irrisolti, tanto dolore e tanta incomprensione, il tutto reso ancora pi\u00f9 drammatico dall'improvvisa e soprattutto inaspettata morte(la donna \u00e8 stata infatti brutalmente assassinata da un tossicodipendente): ebbene, niente di tutto ci\u00f2, perch\u00e9 Gwen era una specie di Buddha vivente, sempre buona, sempre col sorriso, sempre pronta a perdonare e lanciare cuori random all'umanit\u00e0. Il \"dopo\" che Nikki ci racconta \u00e8 un insieme di elementi a casaccio che non hanno sinceramente senso, come il fatto che amici, familiari, conoscenti e anche spasimanti tendano ad evitare Nikki e la sorella dopo il fatto, nemmeno l'avessero ammazzata loro o fosse una cosa di cui vergognarsi; addirittura la nipote di Nikki non vuole ritrovarsi in compagnia della zia perch\u00e9 ha deciso di tornare alla casa dei genitori anche dopo \"il fatto\". Ma qual \u00e8 il problema? Boh, chi l'ha capito..La morte di Gwen \u00e8 un flebile espediente della Oates di parlare di tutt'altro e costruire una storia mediocre e francamente evitabile: non c'\u00e8 pathos, non c'\u00e8.. Non c'\u00e8 proprio nulla :(L'idea che proprio la Oates avesse scelto un tema delicato e doloroso come la morte della madre mi faceva tremare al solo pensiero di quanto tagliente sarebbe stata la storia, di quelle che ti lasciano l'ansia esistenziale a vita (io dopo \"Sorella mio unico amore\" sono stata malissimo per giorni, giuro!).. Insomma, - pensavo - un conto \u00e8 che una storia simile la narri lo scrittore Tal De' Tali e un conto la Oates.. E invece no, perch\u00e9 secondo me la Oates in quel periodo era al mare e ha lasciato che fosse qualcun altro a scrivere la storia, altrimenti non me lo spiego proprio!Un altro fatto che certo non ha allietato la lettura - ma qui mi rendo conto essere un mio unico problema - \u00e8 che il libro ha un odore strano/osceno/asfissiante.

I really liked this book. I loved the character Nikki. Despite some of the reviews which suggest she lacked depth, or was too flawed, I found a unique relation to her. I think she represents a certain selfishness inside of us all. We tend to forget our parents had lives before we existed. They had hopes and dreams and secrets that we were not a part of. Our parents were individuals. I think there is a selfish tendency in us all to take for granted simple things such as conversations with loved ones, and time spent with relatives until they are gone and so many opportunities are missed. I think the reason I was able to connect with Nikki is that to me she represented that selfishness. I think Gwen Eaton, Nikki's recently deceased mother, is one of Joyce Carol Oates' most memorable characters. But I think that for me Nikki will be equally memorable.What I truly appreciate about Joyce Carol Oates is that she doesn't seem to have a target audience or a niche. I think one of the reasons she's one of my favorite authors is that there is something so relatable in all of her novels and stories.

The story begins with Nikki, a tough, modern, independent woman, going to her mother's house for Mothers Day. Gwen, her mum, is derided by Nikki's sister, Clare, a self-important know it all who is, frankly, a horrible person, as being too nice, too trusting. As proof, Gwen has invited lots of other misfits to 'their' lunch. At the end of the day, Nikki is glad to return to her own life a few towns over, and her married boyfriend whom she's waiting to marry. Everything changes when, within the week, Gwen is murdered in the garage and Nikki's and Clare's lives implode in the aftermath. This is no murder mystery- this is the story of Nikki's year of missing her mother, a year in which everything changes. It is beautifully written and is deeply insightful about how humans react to intense fear and grief, and how that differs greatly from how we like to think we could handle a crisis. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1439856-david", "userReview": "This ended up being one of my more favored Oates novels, certainly the one I liked best in any recent time. Some of the ones I've picked up more recently seemed like exercises, masterfully done as they were, but this one had all of the urgency and humanity and reason for being that is in the writing of Oates I like best. I did feel on the going in side of the murder that it was just a bit too contrived, that another death would have seemed less designed, but it certainly fit what came after. I couldn't argue with that, and I was less likely to want to as I kept reading. It just got me stuck a little as I was going into that side of the timeline."}, {"userName": "Olethros", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18503124-olethros", "userReview": "-Muchos creen que son de mejor familia que su familia o que nunca cometer\u00e1n los errores de sus padres.-G\u00e9nero.

In it, Nikki Eaton, a sexually promiscuous \u201cfree spirit\u201d in her early 30s deals with the unexpected death of her mother, who was a pillar in her upstate New York town.In Nikki and in Chataqua Falls, Oates returns to the types of characters and places that have defined so much of her writing. A somewhat directionless woman, who is often the object of others actions and priorities: her mother\u2019s ministrations, her controlling sister\u2019s judgments, her married lover\u2019s availability.Her mother\u2019s death puts all of Nikki\u2019s personal relationships into a crucible as she deals with her paralyzing shock and grief. And as Nikki evaluates those around her and herself, perhaps most importantly, she begins to consider how well she did (and did not) know her own mother.It\u2019s this aspect of the story \u2013 wondering how well can we know anyone: a parent, a sibling, a lover \u2013 that I found the most compelling. I found myself thinking of my own parents\u2019 deaths. I think I knew my parents pretty well, but I certainly didn\u2019t know them when they were in their 20s and 30s \u2013 what were their dreams and desires. In their retirement, I thought they were happy (mostly), but a book like this makes you wonder what unvoiced thoughts were there. A missed dream or a surprise joy.Nikki Eaton was clearly a reflection of Oates\u2019 own grief following her mother\u2019s death, but the strength of the novel comes from her ability to become a lens through which we scrutinize our own ideas, feelings and assumptions.Four stars out of five."}, {"userName": "Jessica Stephenson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28162680-jessica-stephenson", "userReview": "Love love love this book! I must admit, I picked this up for pure catharsis, having lost my mother recently, unexpectedly, tragically as well. I saw so much of myself, my experience, my affliction in Nikki Eaton, and so much of my own mother in Gwen. I've been absolutely stifled and unable to accept my mother's untimely death, but reading this novel has helped me begin to *think* about coping. Oates' alliteration to phantom limbs, ghosts, nervous expectations-- all of these are things that she made fresh for me, though they are so easily redundant and washed-up in their overuse by others. I was deeply moved by this book, and though, like I said, it was a purely cathartic read, there is no doubt that the literary voice employed here is what sets authors like her above the rest. Oates has taken the somewhat ordinary and made it extraordinary. My only complaint, though small, was her overuse of the term \"vehement\" and its subsequent forms. No further comment, other than it got to be an annoyance, although she backed away from it long enough that I got over it eventually and it failed to dull the importance of this most enlightening read."}, {"userName": "Jim Leckband", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4180616-jim-leckband", "userReview": "I'm not sure Oates has a target audience, unlike some authors. Her work is so divergent that pinning a label or genre is useless as her next book may be entirely different. But with this one I feel a little bit out of the target audience: as of this writing I am neither a mom nor a daughter. There is the trademark Oates violence, it is rare that a book of hers doesn't have a violent event. But what this book mostly is about is the intriguing story of how a daughter finally comes to know who her mother was, and a little better of who she wants to be. Chick-lit territory, but not embarrassingly so.At some points the writing did feel like an exercise in getting words out, a little fill-in-the-blanks feel of words for words sake or descriptions that go on to long to let you know Oates has done the research. And then there are inspired bits of writing that take your breath away. My one quibble is that she already used the trope of the single girl falling for the older cop in a previous book (and done a little bit better)."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16318868-ashley", "userReview": "This started off with much more promise than Oates' \"Black Girl/White Girl\" but quickly faded into a pointless, wordy waste of time.Had all uses of the words\"Swarthy\" \"43 Deer Creek Drive\" & \"Redwood amd stucco\" been reduced to just one use... the book most likely would have been 50 pages shorter.Oates' writing is void of meaning and lacks creativity with uses of words like \"fattish\" and the cardboard cut-out details that \"Nikki\" uses to describe people.\"Fattish-female perspiration\" UMMM.. REALLY? I understand that perhaps Oates needed to write this to deal with her own personal struggle but must it have been so boringly pointless? Nikki flipped characters quicker than most bi-polars I know and it made my head spin attempting to understand that there was only one Nikki and not multiple girls.I am pretty sure this is the last JCO book that I ever read; completely bypassing any display that concerns her writing in anyway."}, {"userName": "Irene", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1521651-irene", "userReview": "I listened to the audio version of this book which I'm sure influenced how I reacted to it. The reader was good but the book never grabbed me. I find Joyce Carol Oates work uneven. I absolutely love some of it but a lot of it leaves me cold. This story, about a single, adult woman who visits her widowed mother and finds her body, murdered in the family home, isn't a mystery. It's about her reactions to the death, and her interactions with her sister -- her only sibling -- in the aftermath. I didn't identify with the main character, which is why I didn't connect emotionally with the story. I have a paper copy of the book and in looking at it, I think I may have enjoyed it more on the printed page. On the other hand it's fairly long and I may have found it slow. How's that for an ambivalent review?
