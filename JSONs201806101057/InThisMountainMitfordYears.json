I questioned what makes a book a \"woman's book\"? Then I found A Common Life: The Wedding Story, the wedding book and I couldn't take it. So I guess I may have gotten my answer though some may not agree. To me that book was so totally an emotional story it seemed estrogen soaked. I put it aside and didn't try to rate or review it. I figured, \"hey I get it, some people just want a book about the love story\". But this one went down the same road. There is just so much and so many examples of Timothy, \"saying the wrong thing\" and then \"tearing up\" and Cynthia being \"quietly hurt\" or both of them being \"self-sacrificing\" it just got too much for me. I mean my doctor did tell me to cut back on sugar and this thing drips syrup.So I had to put it down. I've liked the stories of the cleric and his wife functioning with their parishioners dealing with problems meeting challenges and so on.The big scene here so far has been Timothy telling off the local newspaper editor because he dared to use a headline \"Local Pastor's Wife Gets Award\" rather than \"Cynthia Gets Award\". And then he got a little jealous of Cynthia's literary agent and had to get all teary and beg her forgiveness....and on and on we go.If you enjoy this type story, please enjoy. I may try another \"later volume later\" but for now the Mitford books have finally managed to make me feel that these last two at least are most definitely aimed at a female audience and males are somewhat superfluous.Oh well, maybe there needed to be a turn to the overtly female for these, I don't know. As I said if it's what you're looking for enjoy."}, {"userName": "Gretchen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1857744-gretchen", "userReview": "Whenever my life gets too busy, I'm drawn to simple books. Not simple in terms of writing - bodice rippers are for cold winter nights - but simple in terms of plot. This summer, Mitford has been a great source of comfort. In this installment, Father Tim is dealing with life after retirment, and finding it not exactly to his liking. While some of the conflict in this novel is a little too black-and-white to my liking, I really appreciated seeing how several characters were approaching faith. and wrestling with their views. This novel has several different points of view, which helps shed light on the story.I've seen someone compare the Mitford stories to The Waltons television series. I agree that they are similar in tone and approach. But again, when life gets out of control, it's nice to retreat to a small town with beloved characters, and see how they deal with the ongoing complexities and challenges of living a life of faith."}, {"userName": "Ellen Trautner", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29888746-ellen-trautner", "userReview": "This is the kind of Mitford book I love! The last few I read apparently happened after this one, so I'm reading the series out of order. It doesn't really matter. I remember not liking the ones that take place outside of Mitford as much. This one takes place completely in Mitford, woohoo! I've already read the one where Dooley and Lace get married and I remember being confused, mostly because all the skipping around to different characters and only using pronouns so I never knew who she was talking about. This one, Karon uses proper names to introduce characters, stays with each scene long enough so I know what's going on, and builds up several plot lines smoothly. It's cozy and homey and has a happy ending. Father Tim deals with a bout of depression but gets through it and encourages others.

Often because I know the Scripture the author is quoting, I sort of rush through it. This time I took the time to read it fully, more slowly, and grab the context of how it fits within the situation in the story.Maybe because I read this one a little more slowly, I found that I enjoyed this book more than some of the others. I like how things are going for Father Tim, for Dooley, for Cynthia, for Hope, for George. I'm not sure how many books are in this series, but as I read I keep hoping this is not the last one. (This is not the last one, by the way.)I'm growing very comfortable with this author's particular style of writing. Toward the beginning of the series I was a little bothered by what I considered the over-use of some phrases. Now I'm getting to where I am a bit upset if I don't see one of those phrases (such as, \"and he meant it.\")How this series didn't get more attention than it did is beyond me.

Still he does not do anything to preserve his life. He is packing his things to go to the mountains in Tennessee with his wife Cynthia where they will live in a hut with cement floor and try to be an inspiration to children and youth in that area. But they never get there. He doesn't exercise, he doesn't eat well, he decides to cut back on his insulin even though the doctor want to up the dose instead, he breaks his glucometer and doesn't buy a new one and when out driving in the woods, he stops to buy water at a petrol station and when told water is in the back, he settles on a coca cola instead. Result? He crashes in to a stop sign in Mitford, seriously injures a Baptist pastor and kills the pastors dog while he himself goes in to a coma that almost kills him. When he wakes up to life again, he can't shake depression. And reading about a depressed episcopalian priest in his late 60s was not really my thing. Usually these books are cozy and uplifting but this was not so in this book. Two ex-convicts that have made changes in their lives, are no longer that welcome in Mitford. Two old maids are depressed and go through religious doubts. Bill, the joke teller gets a heart attack. The list of misery is endless.This book is too much about depression, too much about disease, too much about people wondering what God wants them to do. I am a deeply religious person but this was way too much Hallelujah for me! Yes, we are supposed to always have God in our thoughts but we don't have to stop at every shop, every corner to say a prayer with people!

Everyone in Mitford has problems & baggage. Cynthia\u2019s first love betrayed her with other women. Miss Pringle also suffered from rejection & betrayal. Joke-teller Uncle Billy suffered under abandonment & cruel poverty. Teenage Lace was viciously abused before Harley, Father Tim, Hoppy & Olivia gave her a new life. As a teen, George Gainor lost his family in a tragic accident. Fearful Hope can\u2019t understand the meaning of her name or the meaning of life. Of course, there\u2019s Dooley, Father Tim\u2019s beloved adopted son, who is just beginning to trust his heart to others. And Father Tim, who as a boy suffered indifference, rejection & abandonment from his own father, has a heart big enough to take in all of them. The author does not dwell on the grisly details but so vividly captures her characters\u2019 heart wounds, fears, dreams, fledgling hopes, loves, and courageous first steps that often even the humorous scenes spark tears for me. At this point in the series, Father Tim is in the midst of helping Dooley find the other Barlowe siblings and help them make new lives.

I loved the entire series and began reading the others in order. Problem was, I had several unanswered questions from the two books I listed. This was the last one in the series that I had not read and it tied all of the unanswered questions together. I believe Jan Karon is a brilliant writer with a true understanding of people's personalities. She is able to transfer these thoughts on paper like no other author I've read. Her take on the thoughts and issues that Father Tim had / has were wonderful. There are so many times that we set clergy up on a pedestal and believe they can do no wrong and that we can't converse with them. Granted, Father Tim did \"no wrong\" - but it was great to see him as a human - and one you would feel very comfortable relating to.If you read her series, begin with her first (At Home In Mitford)."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5394427-joyce", "userReview": "Library copy. Mitford series #7. Love this series. And I probably say this every time, this title is better than the last, deeper, more moving, more engaging, inspiring. My favorite characters in this title (beside Father Tim and Barnabas) are Uncle Billy, Buck Leeper and Dooley Barlow. I was not so keen on Hope and Helene, and there seem to be more protagonists in this one. The crux of the story, which I won't spoil but it involves a Stop sign, is so well done and realistic and makes the reader think in real life terms. I was deeply moved by Father Tim's sermon, the one he struggled so over, based on the verse in 1 Thessalonians. Rare and precious is the work of fiction that creates change in the reader. I've been to Mitford once again -- what an adventure! Can't wait to read #8.

Tim hits a particular dark time in relation to his diabetes regimen. We all do it in our own way - I feel fine and don't want to be tied down to things I \"Have To Do\" in order to live. Freedom from specific diets, freedom from specific exercise regimens or a day without meds that in themselves may cause problems. Then we go on that eating binge, stop exercising for a while or make up our own meds schedule without the Dr's official okey dokey and the darkness lurking in the periphery creeps in slowly ready to consume our joy.I was going through one of these verge of darkness due to my own choices when I picked up this book that had been on my shelf for quite a while.

I'm still stubborn but I now have a little more balance to offset the obstinacy.This is only one of the story lines in the 7th book in the Mitford series.

The truth be told, I thought I had completed the series with A New Song, Father Tim's retirement and interm on the isle of Whitecap. It was a pleasant surprise to discover I had missed more adventures with my old friends. Well, seven years is a long time to be apart. People change. Was it me? Had my tastes changed? Or was it Ms. Karon's writing? I found I had to push myself to get through the first third of the book. Then, for whatever reason, perhaps reacquainting myself with the Mitford folk, or possibly the pace of the story line picking up, I found the last half of In This Mountain much more enjoyable.

This is book 7, which I read after reading book 9. I knew I'd skipped book 8. I'm saving that one for closer to Christmas because of its Christmas theme. It seems, though, that the various book listings that I've seen differ in their orders.Be that as it may, this was another appreciated stroll through Mitford, with its many kindnesses and troubles. This particular book was more difficult than the rest in that Father Tim experienced depression after accidentally causing injury to both himself and a friend, and he faced further troubles with his diabetes.The book was well done, and I liked that, after much struggling, part of Father Tim's emotional recovery had to do with thanksgiving: \"In everything, give thanks,\" from the apostle Paul's second letter to the Thessalonians. That made this Mitford book a good Thanksgiving read, despite some of the darker themes earlier in it, and even those can be dear. I have personally found that whenever I have trouble thanking or praising God, I have discovered myself to be broken in some way, for we are meant to praise Him. Being unable to do so is a sign that something in my life needs to be changed.Also, whenever I am consistently thanking God in the evenings, with my drifting-off-to-sleep thoughts, I find myself more satisfied with life, more aware of His presence and blessings, happier in general, and a better person to be around.I had been asked to pray for a friend and her family, without knowing why. That's okay; God knows. But it does leave me wondering what to pray. Among praying other things, I borrowed a prayer from this book: \"Lord, we ask You for [them] ... strength, strength of spirit, strength of mind, strength of purpose, strength of body. May You shower [them] with Your might, yet tender grace, and give [them] hope and health all the days of [their] long and obedient life.I loved the joke about the preacher and the taxi driver, and told that one to my younger kids, to their laughter.Favorite quotes:\"My grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness.\" - God to the Apostle Paul\"Great tranquility of heart is his for he who cares for neither praise nor blame.\" - Thomas a KempisI try to wait for Him to make the darkness light, then grow afraid and try to create the light on my own.\"\"Lord, speak to me, please. I can't go on like this. Speak to me in a way I can understand clearly. I've read Your word, I've sought Your counsel, I've whined, I've groveled, I've despaired, I've pled - and I've waited. And through it all, Lord, You've been so strangely silent.\"\"Almighty and eternal God, so draw our hearts to Thee, so guide our minds, so fill our imaginations, so control our wills, that we may be wholly Thine, utterly dedicated unto Thee and then use us, we pray, as Thou wilt, and always to Thy glory and the welfare of Thy people, through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\"\"Fill her heart with certainty - with the confidence and certainty that You made [her] for Yourself, that You might take delight in her life ... and in her service.\""}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10983379-chris", "userReview": "This took longer that the rest for me to listen to.

In this Mountain, the seventh in the series, is a little heavier in overall tone than its predecessors as Father Tim himself struggles with some very dark internal demons rather than helping others through their trials. But his reaction is real and familiar, I'm certain, to many readers, making this book an inspiring addition to the series. My only real complaint about In this Mountain is that a few of the plot lines seemed to be left unfinished.
