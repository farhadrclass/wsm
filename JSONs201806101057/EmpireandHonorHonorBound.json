I\u2019d say 175 pages max for the amount of new material provided in the latest offering of the Argentina series. The author and co-author, I.e. the co-author succeeded in converting once interesting characters into parodies of themselves, while slogging them through a totally uninteresting, often confusing tale. You'd think the father would instruct the son to just stick to the time tested formula (stick to the script, stupid). He didn't listen, or more likely, thought he was Hemingway. It appears the WEB empire intends to expand into volumes #8, #9 and probably #10 \u2013 count me out. Evita made an appearance in this book so Butterworth Hemingway must be chomping at the bit to bring in Andrew Lloyd Webber as a guest B.I.S. agent or S.A.A. passenger."}, {"userName": "Christopher Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31381002-christopher-taylor", "userReview": "This book is set at the end of WW2, when the allies were trying to clean up and capture all the Nazis and their equipment. Submarines containing riches, equipment, and art were sent out to help powerful Nazi leaders escape and set up for a \"phoenix\" rebirth of the reich, primarily to Argentina.This is a book in a long series of stories involving established fictional characters interweaving with real ones, and as such drops the reader in the middle of a saga, but not uncomfortably. There is, perhaps, too much recapping and explanation, including several sections that seemed to have been cut and pasted into the book several times.Some of the story I liked; parts about the young officer in Germany. Others I didn't care for and especially found the Peron/Evita story dull and dragging. Overall it took entirely too long to get to the main point, and other than repeated meetings by the bad guys making the same plots over and over again, the bulk of the story is the heroes planning and talking about things, and historical events.I don't really recommend the book for reading, but it does cover an interesting part of history."}, {"userName": "Joseph", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9479701-joseph", "userReview": "Pure entertainment, fiction loosely based on history. Good research, but dialogue doesn't ring true and is sometimes anachronistic. Still good fun, light read and entertaining. And, the bad guys are really bad, the good guys are funny and heroic to the point that they stretch your imagination. All the good guys are incredible marksmen, pilots and speak three to four languages. Did I mention they are also appreciative of things liquid, especially scotch and wine.

The characters are compelling, the story is well-paced and developed. All in all, THIS was the series that turned me on initially to Mr. Griffin's books. Had the series ended at a trilogy, it would rank alongside Deighton's Bernard Samson trilogies and le Carre's Smiley trilogy amongst the best I've read.Unfortunately, following a nine-year break, the decision was made to resurrect Cletus Frade and Co. Whether this was due to publisher pressure, fan demand, or the author simply wanting to extend the storyline after so long away, I don't know, but the results are mixed at best.Books IV-VII follow Frade and his merry band of O.S.S. warriors through the dying stages of World War Two, through the immediate post-war period. Frade now comes across as more of a caricature of himself, cracking out wise comments as if there was no tomorrow, and generally proving that he's a \"loose cannon.\" All four of these books are bogged down by the frequent recitations of past events, or recaps. In all frankness, this would be fine if you just picked up the series post-Book III. The reality though, is that most who are reading IV-VII have already read the previous novels, so we're left with page after page of rehashes. Probably 50-100 pages could be cut from each book if these were eliminated.Other areas where these falls short are the \"coincidental\" appearances of nearly everyone Frade has liaised with, AND their best buddies, all of whom are happy to join in the bonhomie of Team Cletus. By Book VII, when two more Germans show up and join the O.S.S. party, the reader is left with a \"come on already\" mentality. I don't think even M.C. Hammer had the entourage that Frade has by Book VII.Finally, the constant mantra of \"we'll get down to business...after we've had a drink or three,\" gets really old, really fast. Jack Higgins and Alistair MacLean novels sometimes suffer from the same thing. It's chaff. By eliminating the drinking scenes from each book, you'd chop another 25-50 pages.Ultimately, I hope this is the end for Frade and Co. It is a worthwhile series, but I'd really suggest you stop after Book III."}, {"userName": "Matt aka", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19543467-matt-aka", "userReview": "Empire and Honor is a new genre of Action & Adventure for my book reviews but not an unfamiliar plot. This is the seventh book in the Honor Bound series but I didn't have any problem understanding the story. The book is about a few men trying to stop the Nazis, who are trying to flee to Argentina, from selling nuclear materials to the Russians.I enjoyed this book but did not find it extremely memorable. The beginning of the book is interesting with a young American soldier being put in charge of a German woman who had walked a long distance trying to find safety. He ends up having a romantic encounter with her that leaves a large impression on him than her. He ends up joining the OSS which is a group that works under the radar under the direction of President Roosevelt himself.Germans have been flooding into Argentina to escape from Europe at the end of World War 2 and Lieutenant Colonel Cletus Howell Frade, an OSS member, is responsible for helping many of them get started with new lives in Argentina. However, not all Germans are welcome in Argentina as several Nazis and the SS arrive with the plan to sell enriched uranium smuggled by submarine to the Germans.One issue I had with this story was trying to keep track of all the Argentine and German names. Check out the wiki link here if you need help keeping all the names straight. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_Bo...I would rate this book 4 out of 5 stars. I enjoyed the story as their was plenty of action and the characters all had distinct personalities. However, like other reviewers have stated the plot was sometimes a little confusing and I would wonder if I missed something or it just wasn't written clearly. A reviewer mentioned it was a good airplane book and it kept me interested during my long daily commute.If you are interested in more of my book reviews that cover fantasy, SciFi, superheroes and more then check out my site www.fantasyworldwriter.com and signup for my newsletter.

I hear it said often that his books \u201caren\u2019t as good as they used to be\u201d (and that since they are now co-authored by his son, William E. Butterworth IV, that the books are not even by Griffin anymore), but that\u2019s simply not the case.

For Cletus Frade and his colleagues in the OSS, it should be time to pack up, but they have far more important things to do.Chief among them is the protection of their assets, especially the human ones. In the closing months of the war, the United States made a secret deal with the head of German intelligence\u2019s Soviet section. In exchange for a treasure trove of intelligence - in particular the identity of the Soviet spies in the American atomic bomb program - his people would be spirited to safety in Argentina. Only a handful of people know about it. If word got out, all hell would break loose, and the United States would lose some of its most valuable sources and secrets.Meanwhile, in Argentina, a U-boat captain pops up out of the blue and surrenders his submarine and crew. And in the American Zone of Occupation in Germany, a young counter-intelligence agent pursues an unusual assignment perhaps a little bit too viorously. The consequences of both actions will affect not only Frade and company, but everthing they're working on.Now things are really going to get complicated.", "title": "Empire and Honor\n      \n          (Honor Bound #7)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13593569-empire-and-honor", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1335611180l/13593569.jpg", "reviews": 86, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1415338.W_E_B_Griffin", "name": "W.E.B.
