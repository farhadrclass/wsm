I had never even heard of this poem until tonight. It wasn't in any of the works of Shakespeare that I own. To be honest, I thought The Bard only wrote sonnets and plays, so when I discovered that there were some other works of poetry I was intrigued. Unfortunately, The Phoenix and the Turtle is like the \"American Pie\" of Elizabethan England--so coded it's difficult to tell what in the heck is being said. I read it twice, but twice is not enough. I need to study this further in hopes of getting more out of it. I would love to rate it higher, but as of yet I have no idea what it means other than a Phoenix and a turtle(dove) fall in love and die. Feel free to clue me in, people."}, {"userName": "Lillian Bittle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47347491-lillian-bittle", "userReview": "\"Beauty, truth, and rarity,Grace in all simplicity,Here enclos'd in cinders lie.\""}, {"userName": "Gabriela Paige", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40447521-gabriela-paige", "userReview": "Well, that was pretty, but hard to understand."}, {"userName": "Angel Parrish", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17825414-angel-parrish", "userReview": "Amazon freebieOne of Shakespeare's first works.

It might also be the most confusing thing I have ever read. With the help of transliteration, everything in this beautiful poem becomes clearer. (It also helped when I realized the turtle was a dove and not a reptile.) Shakespeare uses multiple historical innuendos in this poem along with abstract personification. There are a lot of repetitive explanations about the phoenix and turtle being \"one in two beings.\" Everything Shakespeare writes returns to this theme. Although this seems to be annoying, he wanted us to realize why the phoenix and turtle should be remembered and that there will never be another union like them."}, {"userName": "Joaomaia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58469397-joaomaia", "userReview": "William Shakespeare's \"The Phoenix and the Turtle\" is a poem that may be characterized as both an allegory and an elegy. An allegory is a literary work with a hidden meaning (and sometimes several hidden meanings). An elegy is a somber poem lamenting a person's death or memorializing a dead person."}, {"userName": "Steve Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30274397-steve-campbell", "userReview": "Short, sweet, and rather obscure.
