The author has now started a new series, featuring Charlotte & Thomas' son, Daniel Pitt. Daniel has just finished his education to be an attorney and he's glad his father is proud of him. One of his first cases involves assisting a senior attorney with a murder case. Russell Graves is accused of murdering his wife. Graves is to be executed in 21 days for the killing. Daniel has to pull out all the stops and use the investigation techniques he picked up from his father to try and find the real killer before time is up. Can he discover the truth before Graves is executed? I enjoyed this book. At times things moved a little too slowly, but once action kicked in again it saved the plot from becoming boring. Daniel is a bit naive, but I imagine his character will develop nicely as the series moves along. I like the fact that she is aging her characters and starting Daniel out in a series of his own. Gives the books a dose of realism. The ending had some sweet surprises that I did not expect. I like Daniel as a main character. He's just coming into his own and using the skills his parents taught him as well as his education. He is a bit too naive at times though. I'm sure he will mature as more books are written in this new series. I did find some places where the plot got a bit confusing because it referred back to events in Charlotte & Thomas Pitt novels that I haven't read. But it wasn't important enough facts to lessen my enjoyment of the story. Can't wait for the next book in this series! I loved the first few Charlotte & Thomas books when I was a teenager. Reading this book makes me want to go back and re-read them and enjoy the books that I missed in the series over the years. **I voluntarily read an advance readers copy of this book from Random House/Ballentine via NetGalley.

Here we have switched centuries to 1910 only four years from WWI & this the next generation of Pitts Daniel who has not followed in his father's footsteps but gone to the dark side of law a barrister often hated by the police. Thomas is now Sir Thomas Pitt Head of Special Branch which for Daniel a conflict of interest. Perry is one of few authors of Crime that has moved her stories forward & aged the Dective too unlike Poirot who never change or Miss Marpel.. ITV in the 1990s tried to make TV series of these books but only did one & it was washout I don't remember it much but do know it stunk & the actor was ghastly as Pitt. Shame as if done well they have huge amount of books This first in series of books about Daniel .Russell Graves is on trial for bashing his wife's head in & burning her face he is horrible cold unlike man even by Kitteridge his defence & Daniel is his junior in the case .A case that goes to a guilty plea thus the title. But for Daniel it unlucky it is not end but the beginning of his troubles , because Graves is not guilty he's been framed so Daniel trays found out who & Victor Narraway Thomas Pitt's former friend is in the frame & worse still so may be his Dad.!.I don't care what Anne Perry says that this new series it's not because if don't know who Narraway is or secret societies from earlier Pitt books you be completely lost& Perry will keep you in the dark till last few pages.I remember one where the murder did not appear title three pages of end of the book & had not been in it title then .So expect the unexpected"}, {"userName": "Marialyce", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce", "userReview": "4 here is a new series starsUp until this book, I had not read an Anne Perry book. I am happy to say that I will be changing that in the near future. I found the book set in 1910 Victorian England to be a wonderfully paced novel that had just the amount of intrigue that held one's interest.Daniel Pitt is a new untried lawyer. He is thrown, because of circumstances, into a murder trial of a man who is accused of murdering his wife and then horribly disfiguring her by burning her face. Russell Graves, the accused, is an arrogant belligerent man but Daniel feels, even though Graves is pretty awful that he is not a murderer. So Daniel, with the help of others tracks down the story and the man who is Graves is exposed as a biographer who intends to harm others through his scurrilous writing and unfortunately, one of his targets is Daniel's beloved father. Aided in his investigation is a wonderful group of people that I am sure we will see in the future novels in this series.Daniel puts the pieces together and finds that in possibly clearing Graves, he will indite others who have been ever so harmed by Graves. Twenty-one days all the time he has to find Graves innocent but twenty-one days is also the time it will take to turn Daniel's world upside down. Thank you to Anne Perry, Random House Publishing and NetGalley for an arc of this new series novel."}, {"userName": "OLT", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72135750-olt", "userReview": "When an author writes a multiple-book series featuring a character, or in the case of Perry's original Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series, a couple, the decision must be made whether to keep the protagonist(s) in a time bubble or to allow them to age. Perry began her Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Victorian mystery series years ago with THE CATER STREET HANGMAN, first published in 1979, and in that one upper-class Charlotte meets Thomas Pitt, a lowly policeman. While they solve this first mystery, they fall in love and will later marry.Over the years the Pitts have partnered in solving many crimes--at least 32 of them because that's the number of books in the series--and in raising their children. This all started in Victorian times and now Perry begins a new series set in the Edwardian era, 1910 for this first book, featuring their son Daniel, all grown up and a junior barrister at the law firm of Fford Croft and Gibson. As the book begins, Daniel is on his own for the first time as defense in the trial of Roman Blackwell, former policeman who had worked with Daniel's father before Thomas became head of Special Branch. Blackwell, now a private detective with his own moral code, is still a friend, so Daniel feels a special pressure to save Blackwell.Well, this particular trial is not the real plot of the book, although it is quite interesting and takes up the first two chapters. However, it's just setting us up to see where Daniel is at this point in his career and to give him a personal relationship with Blackwell and Blackwell's mother, who are somewhat important to the rest of the story and probably will feature in the books to follow.The main plot revolves around Daniel's next case. He is assigned to assist senior barrister Kitteridge in the defense of famous author/biographer Russell Graves, who is accused of the brutal murder of his wife. The trial does not go well for them and Graves is convicted and sentenced to be hanged in 21 days, hence the title of this book. Now Daniel has only that amount of time to find the real killer and save Graves from his fate. To do this he will be enlisting the help of investigator Blackwell and Blackwell's mother, who knows the in's and out's of London society, and also the assistance of a very interesting character, Miriam Fford Croft, daughter of Daniel's employer, the owner of the law firm where Daniel is a junior barrister.Miriam is perhaps the most intriguing person in this book, as a 40+-year-old single woman who is educated and knowledgeable about both medicine and chemistry. Limited by the times she is living in, Miriam had passed all her examinations but was not awarded her degrees and is not recognized by her male peers. But she makes a perfect sidekick for Daniel in helping him solve this crime. Her observations lead to some crucial insights into what's going on.This book has the best of two worlds for me in mysteries: (1) There are compelling courtroom scenes, which I have always enjoyed, and (2) there is the usual methodical investigative procedure, with the search for physical clues and the interviewing of key suspects and witnesses. Lots of twists and turns here and a few red herrings. A very attentive reader can probably figure out the murderer before the Big Reveal, but this is still a compelling read and a good beginning to the Daniel Pitt series.I'll be looking forward to watching Daniel mature and even grow older, as his parent did before him. BTW, not to worry, fans of Charlotte and Thomas. They have cameos in this book. They aren't totally out of the picture but they have passed the crime-solving torch over to their son."}, {"userName": "Bam", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam", "userReview": "The first Daniel Pitt novel is a spin-off of Anne Perry's long-running mystery series set in Victorian England, featuring Thomas and Charlotte Pitt. Their son Daniel is now a lawyer working for the small law firm of fford Croft and Gibson and he is fresh off a big win when he is unexpectedly called in to assist the esteemed lawyer Kitteridge in a murder trial after unforeseen circumstances have created a vacancy. When this trial is lost and their client sentenced to be hanged, they have twenty-one days in which to find some new piece of evidence or legal grounds for appeal to stay the execution. Daniel takes over the investigative role while the more experienced Kitteridge looks into the legal aspects. In the early 1900s, forensics is very much a fledgling science and it's interesting to see how this plays a role in trying to solve the case. There are plenty of satisfying twists and turns to this mystery and some remarkable characters, but one of the biggest draws is the historical setting which gives the reader a glimpse into English society in the early 1900s. A good start to what will most likely be a popular new series for Ms Perry to pursue.Thank you to NetGalley, the publisher and author for providing me with an arc of this new Victorian mystery."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7395171-dianne", "userReview": "They say, if we listen close enough, the dead will talk to us, they will tell the story of their death and it will be the truth and nothing but the truth.

It takes place in a later time period than I normally read, so I almost passed it by. However, it is by an author whose writing I enjoy and it featured the son, Daniel, of the lead characters, Charlotte and Thomas Pitt, in another series that I really enjoy \u2013 so I decided to give it a try. The writing is great, the plot is excellent and I came to really like and appreciate the characters. I couldn\u2019t tell for sure which characters would be recurring in the series, nor could I decide if I thought there would be a romance between Daniel and Miriam \u2013 since she is almost his mother\u2019s age. It will be a delight to find out what is going to happen next!Daniel Pitt, twenty-five years of age, is a newly minted lawyer with a degree from Cambridge. 1910 is an exciting time in which to live. Women are beginning to be more and more insistent about their rights and the field of forensic science is in its infancy. They are able to identify an individual by their fingerprints, bullets can be matched, they can tell human blood from animal and x-rays have been invented. Daniel grew up learning about honesty, honor, and integrity from both his father and his mother. His father, Thomas Pitt started out as a Bow Street Runner and moved on to the newly formed police force and he is now knighted and is the head of the Special Branch. I have read and loved the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series and can highly recommend it as a series. Daniel has just wrapped up a really tricky murder case when he\u2019s ordered to another courtroom to assist another lawyer, Kitteridge, in yet another murder trial. This one isn\u2019t going well and neither lawyer really believes that the defendant is innocent. They think that, in a stretch, he could be, but they aren\u2019t convinced of it. Besides, the defendant is a total jerk and nobody, including the lawyers, likes him. When he is convicted and sentenced to hang, they aren\u2019t surprised. They have twenty-one days to find a reason to appeal the verdict and keep him from being hanged.As Daniel investigates and makes more and more discoveries, he becomes convinced that Graves is really innocent. However, he has no idea how to prove it. He believes that his only option is to find out who the real murderer is and his investigation leads to some real soul searching on Daniel\u2019s part. The client is a writer and he is writing an expose that could ruin his father. It isn\u2019t true, but can Daniel prove that?It was a really great read and there wasn\u2019t a dull moment in it.

I particularly like the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt one and this new one is about their son, Daniel, now a lawyer. I remember Daniel growing up so there is something particularly satisfying about that. You don't need to have read the other series to enjoy this quite likable new series. Daniel successfully gets his first client acquitted from murder and then is thrown into a case that can seemingly not be won. The despicable client is accused of murdering and then disfiguring her beyond recognition. The evidence points that way but Daniel has an uneasy feeling. Yet he dislikes his client so much that he's not sure he wants to get him off. He turns to a young woman for help. She has trained to be a doctor and forensic expert but can't get the titles because she's a female. There is the introduction of fingerprinting and x-rays, both new sciences. It's just wonderful to see how things we take for granted were first introduced and explained.  I really am looking forward to the next one. I think it's a good expansion and way for her to grow all the beloved characters. I think it was a job well done.

I adored the long running series set in the late Victorian era about Daniel's parents. This one is during the Edwardian Era and begins perhaps a decade after the last released Thomas and Charlotte Pitt book. Daniel is fresh out of university with a law degree and his father helps get him in with a prestigious London law firm. Now he must prove himself to his new employer and to his father with his first courtroom case- a big one, since his client is in the dock for murder. No sooner than he finishes this trial than he is put on an even bigger one.I loved getting to know this adult Daniel who has the best of both his parents in him and lots of promise. He's vulnerable and also confident, but he has definitely been tossed into the deep end with these cases. I enjoyed getting to know the situation and the surrounding cast of characters.The author uses her gift for historical setting, social issues of the day and a profound gift for writing complex characters to tell a steadily paced, twisting mystery. Daniel uncovers the clues that will either hang his detestable client or free him, but things get complicated fast leading close to home. The case brings out domestic abuse, the plight of people with disabilities, the issues of responsible writing when it comes to tell-alls, illegitimacy, women's equality, and so much more. The author teases out these social issues as part of the plot without getting pedantic.As usual, the mystery is not as easy as it looks from the beginning and the moral dilemma that comes with it is just as challenging for Daniel. I started to get an inkling when the clues popped up, but that just made things more knotty instead of easier. I enjoyed how the mystery tied this first of Daniel's cases back to the earlier series so his parents make an appearance, but also established itself in its own right. I hope the new cast of characters will end up being regulars because I loved the Blackwoods with their shades of gray quirkiness, Daniel's kind landlady, Miriam the female forensics scientist who is the daughter of Daniel's boss. So yes, this first in the new spin-off series was great. Love this peek at the Edwardian Era, a new main character, and a great twisting mystery plot. While I think a reader could get by starting with this book, it does have strong ties to the earlier Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series- and they are fabulous so why miss them. Definitely a recommend for historical mystery lovers.I rec'd this book from Net Galley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Alisha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1790086-alisha", "userReview": "This mystery novel begins a new spin-off from a series Anne Perry has been writing for decades.

First, Perry draws Edwardian-era London with the same finesse she loans to her Victorian mysteries. The research (Especially in budding forensics ) is exceptional. I also really loved Daniel. I have to tell you that a much as I love Charlotte and Thomas Pitt, it is about time for someone else to take the stage and Daniel is the perfect hero. A junior barrister assigned to his first case, he has the same curious nature as his father (late of the Police and now a knighted member of the Special Branch in more foreign investigations) and the refined energy of his mother and yet is someone completely his own. He\u2019s idealistic and passionate and I really fell hard for him. He is a very worthy successor. Having just dazzled in the courtcase of (the very likeable to the point that he sticks around) Roman Blackwell, Daniel is sent to the Old Bailey to assist Toby Kitteridge, a lawyer a decade senior in a hanging case. Russell Graves is sentenced to death for the murder and subsequent disfigurement of his wife and Marcus fford Croft (of Daniel\u2019s firm) beseeches Daniel and Kitteridge to win an appeal. They have the traditional three Sundays--- 21 days\u2014to prove a man confoundedly unlikeable (seriously, this guy is the worst) innocent. Just because a man is a brute, doesn\u2019t make him guilty. Things get a little more dastardly when Daniel discovers that Graves is a notorious biography writer, renowned for taking heroic stories down a notch. The fiend seems to have some rather incriminating evidence that could destroy Daniel\u2019s father\u2019s reputation. I just absolutely fell into this story and gobbled it up. I LOVED that it balanced a clever and airtight mystery ( I had NO idea of the twist at the end) with a very (smart) 21 chapters of intense quicksand and, of course, a rousing Old Bailey courtcase. Daniel seems more to want to be a detective like his father than a lawyer and this book proves that he is well equipped in both and I am SO stoked for this new series. Also, there is a perfectly AWESOME and intellectual woman named Miraim who, though unmarried and well in her 30s, is just a cracker jack scientist and helps Daniel break open the truly pivotal moment in the case.

For those well acquainted with the Pitt series, this book is a very good segue between the series of Thomas and Charlotte to Daniel. There is, however, one large detail which is unexplained and would have been helpful to the series readers. Still, it is interesting how the recounting of Daniel\u2019s family leads to his awareness of the importance of connections\u2014\u201cMy dear, a secret exposed is a secret you can no longer use. It is an opportunity wasted, is it not?\u201dThe analysis of the crime scene is well done and prompts Daniel to ask the questions some readers may have had. The scene of Daniel having dinner in the servants\u2019 quarters is particularly wonderful as it shows the dynamics of the staff and their relationship. It also provides an opportunity to describe a meal which is relatively simple but enviable. Mr. Falthorne, butler to the Graveses, is delightful and provides an interesting revelation. There is nothing like hitting that \u201cAha!\u201d moment when a significant link is made. However, it is also an opportunity for Perry to present Daniel with a serious moral dilemma. Perry doesn\u2019t take the easy way out. She challenges both her readers and her characters. This is, in part, what makes her such an effective author. Although set in the early 1900\u2019s her observations are timely--\u201cMost people, women included, judge according to their own experience. We think what we need to think in order to hold on to our own worldview and validate what we must believe. It is a matter of survival, although it may seem merely to be prejudice to someone else. It takes a lot of courage to turn your world upside down and start again.\u201d She states truths; those things we intrinsically know but seldom say.\u201cTwenty-One Days\u201d is a very good start to this new series. The plot has twists, turns, and surprising revelations. The element of time running out is well used, and the final courtroom scene very effective.

We jump forward 10 years from the action in Murder on the Serpentine to about 1910 or so; Daniel is now 25, a junior barrister conducting his first serious case and feeling woefully inadequate.The trial that opens the book serves to introduce us to Daniel and several other characters who will probably be featured players in the series. The action then shifts to the main drama. Russell Graves, noted biographer and thoroughly unpleasant person, is on trial for murdering his wife. The defense case, argued by Daniel and his senior colleague Kitteridge, fails; Graves is convicted and sentenced to death. They now have 21 days to find enough evidence to get the verdict overturned.Marcus fford Croft (head of the law firm) assigns Kitteridge to find any possible legal loophole and sets Daniel off to investigate the Graves family, including the late Ebony Graves and Russell Graves himself.Now the pace really picks up--lots of twists and turns to keep the reader turning the pages to find out what happens next. Perry has fun working new technology (X-rays! Fingerprints!) into the cases. She also touches on 'playing to the jury', a valuable skill for any barrister. The book that Graves is currently writing becomes a key plot point, providing people who might have a motive to kill Mrs. Graves. All a bit far-fetched, but it must be checked out. This leads Daniel to several rather tense conversations with his father, Sir Thomas, head of Special Branch.Experienced mystery readers will, no doubt, leap to the correct conclusion when they read the description of Mrs. Graves' body. That doesn't diminish the enjoyment of watching Daniel and friends work their way towards the mystery's solution. Perry plays fair; all the clues are there.The action concludes with two tense courtroom scenes which tie up all the plot threads in a very satisfactory way. The final scene gives the reader a chance to catch their breath, relax and smile over a job well done.I am definitely looking forward to renewing my acquaintance with young Daniel Pitt."}, {"userName": "Rebekah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16607379-rebekah", "userReview": "****a few general spoilers ahead****The last of the Charlotte/Thomas Pitt novels ended on a triumphant note as Thomas was knighted by the Queen for his services. After all of his difficult challenges and tribulations it was a fitting and perfect end. Much to my joy, the baton has been taken up in this new novel by his son, Daniel Pitt, a newly minted young lawyer. This effectively gets Anne Perry back to murder mysteries as opposed to foiling anarchists and other threats to the state and will be welcomed by most of her loyal readers. We have seen Daniel, and his sister Jemima, grow up through the 32 books of her first series. Twenty-one Days begins approximately 10 years later, and has Daniel assigned to help defend and save from execution a biographer, Russell Graves, whose latest work purports to expose Vincent Narraway, Thomas\u2019s mentor, and his wife, the beloved Vespacia Cumming-Gould, as manipulators and blackmailers whose actions fueled their ambition rather than in service to their country. As the closest of associates to Narraway, Daniels father, Thomas, comes in for his fair share this imminent threat to reputations and legacies. Like his father and Charlotte before him, Daniel has to wrestle with ethics, duty, truth and love for and loyalty to his family and the values they hold dear.I won\u2019t go into more regarding the plot, but this first in the series has a lighter tone than many of Anne Perry\u2019s previous books, and I welcome it. It is full of twists, questions, red-herrings, and shocks (to those who didn\u2019t see them coming). It introduces a bevy of new characters that are set up to be staples of this new series. This particularly includes Daniels probable future love interest Miriam fford Croft, a remarkable and brilliant woman, ahead of her time, and also not quite 15 years older than Daniel. Thomas and Charlotte make more than brief cameo appearances in this new beginning. Sadly, Narraway and Vespacia have both passed away, but Jemima is, I think, waiting in the wings. Although she now lives in New York and is a married mother of two, I suspect that she will figure in this continuation of the Pitt dynasty in future books. Heck, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she gets her own series! After all, she is married to a policeman, like her mother. And heaven knows, domestic happiness and motherhood never stopped Charlotte from providing invaluable assistance to her husband\u2019s career in crime and intrigue."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802440-cynthia", "userReview": "Anne Perry is one of my go to authors and I\u2019ve followed most of her books from when they were first published. I\u2019ve enjoyed the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt series and, in turn, the Monk books though I\u2019ve enjoyed her other books less. I was so afraid of losing Thomas and Charlotte but this beginning saga with their son Daniel at the beginning of his London law career is wonderful. He\u2019s his own man even at only aged twent-five but he still is clearly their off spring with similar values and integrity. And Thomas isn\u2019t abandoned though he\u2019s on the sidelines in \u201cTwenty-one Days\u201d. Charlotte figures less in this episode however I have hopes she\u2019ll be more represented as the series goes on.Perry\u2019s five World War I books were ok but they didn\u2019t sing for me the same way that her Piit and Monk series did so I\u2019m hopeful that Daniel\u2019s story, which begins in 1910, will provide another go at that fascinating period. Also, a Cambridge educated chemist and physician, Miriam, will provide a way to explore women\u2019s issues of this time. Though Miriam has the education she was refused her titles because she\u2019s a woman. Last I\u2019m also hoping Daniel\u2019s sister Jemima will be included in the series though that may not happen since she\u2019s now married with two kids and living in New York...or maybe is Perry at her best.Thank you to the publisher for providing an advance reader\u2019s copy."}, {"userName": "Suzanne (The Bookish Libra)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/991422-suzanne-the-bookish-libra", "userReview": "Anne Perry\u2019s Twenty-One Days is the first book in a new series that follows Daniel Pitt, junior barrister and son of Detective Thomas Pitt (from Perry\u2019s popular Thomas Pitt series). When the novel opens, Daniel has minimal experience in the courtroom and yet somehow finds himself assigned to defend a famous client, biographer Russell Graves, who is charged with having murdered his wife. When the trial doesn\u2019t go well and Graves ends up sentenced to death even though he insists that he is innocent, Daniel is given twenty-one days to find out what really happened and file an appeal. If he can\u2019t find something in those twenty-one days, Graves will be executed.It\u2019s a race against the clock that takes Daniel in a direction he never expected to go in, one that could ruin the reputation of London\u2019s Special Police Branch, where Daniel\u2019s beloved father works as a detective.Will Daniel find the truth? Will the truth free or condemn his client? How does the Special Police Branch fit into the picture? First, let me start by saying that even though the Daniel Pitt series is a spin-off series from Anne Perry\u2019s popular Thomas Pitt series (Daniel is Thomas\u2019 son and is still a child in the earlier series), it can still easily be enjoyed as a standalone. I didn\u2019t feel like I was missing anything relevant by not having read the earlier series. That said, however, I enjoyed this book so much and was intrigued enough by every mention of Thomas Pitt that, at some point, I may go back and read the Thomas Pitt series.Daniel Pitt was absolutely my favorite part of Twenty-One Days. I found him to be witty and charming, which made him a fun character to follow, but at the same time, I also loved how na\u00efve and unsure of himself he could be at times because he\u2019s brand new to his chosen profession and has been thrown into this huge case by chance. I\u2019m always a sucker for a likeable underdog and that description fits Daniel to a T. Daniel had many qualities that I found endearing, such as his fierce loyalty to his father. But even as devoted as he is to his father, Daniel is still determined to find out the truth to see if it could help his client, even if the truth could possibly turn out to be something Daniel ultimately doesn\u2019t want to hear because it could negative impact the Special Police Branch and by extension, his father. I really admired that he was willing to make such tough choices.In addition to Daniel, I also really liked the secondary characters, so much so that I hope they will all continue to play active roles in future books. There\u2019s Kitteridge, the senior barrister that Daniel gets partnered with on his big case. At first these two are like oil and water because Kitteridge feels put out that he has to work alongside this newbie on such a major case, but they eventually come together as a pretty dynamic duo when it comes to working all aspects of the case in and out of the courtroom.Then there\u2019s Miriam, who adds a touch of Feminism to the story. She has gone to medical school and studied to become what we would probably now consider to be a Medical Examiner, but because she\u2019s a woman, she was never awarded an actual degree. She\u2019s clearly a little bitter about this but is excited when she is called upon to help Daniel with his case. Miriam is smart, tough, funny, and I think she and Daniel may have a bit of a mutual attraction going on. It\u2019s subtle but adorable, and I would totally ship it if they do in fact become a couple.In addition to this fun cast of characters, the setting of Twenty-One Days also very much appealed to me. It\u2019s set in London in the 1910\u2019s, and the author does a wonderful job of capturing the time period and the location. Although this book is set a bit later than Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s books, I still got a bit of Sherlock Holmes vibe as I was reading it. I love the Sherlock Holmes series, so this was definitely a plus for me.I\u2019m kind of a CSI junkie so one of my favorite elements of this book was the forensic science that comes into play. With the story being set in the 1910\u2019s, we\u2019re still in the very early days of fingerprints, etc. so sometimes it could be risky to try to introduce a science that was still so little understood. I loved the tension that the use of forensics actually added to the story because Daniel and his scientist friend Miriam have to find just the right balance \u2013 they need to explain how fingerprints work in such a way that there is no misunderstanding how the science works but without coming across as condescending to the jury. The last thing Daniel needs to do is alienate the group of people who hold his client\u2019s fate in their hands.And speaking of Daniel\u2019s client and his case, the mystery in this first book was really solid too. It had lots of twists and turns that I didn\u2019t see coming and kept me on the edge of my seat for much of the book.The only real issue I had was that occasionally, especially in the early pages, the pacing was a little slow. I\u2019m chalking it up to all of the setting the stage that is in involved in starting a new series and introducing all of the major characters, etc. Once I settled into the story though, it moved along at a nice, steady pace.Twenty-One Days is a solid first book in Perry\u2019s new series. I think fans of the earlier Thomas Pitt series will enjoy seeing young Daniel all grown up, but I also think that those who have never read about the Pitt family before will enjoy this new series just as well. The characters are well drawn and it\u2019s a lot of fun watching them come together as a team. I look forward to continuing the series and watching them work their way through more twists and turns to uncover the truth on future cases.Thanks so much to the author, the publisher, and Netgalley for providing me with a review copy of this book.

It is a new series for this writer, and I quite approve. The book jumps ten years in the lives of Charlotte, and Commander Pitt. Their son Daniel is through law school and a junior lawyer in a very fine firm. I enjoyed this because he does a lot of investigating with some new characters. He manages to do pretty well, but gets bumped to a very important case, due to an accident. This case is a lot more detailed, and the man wanted for murder ,is a man who you'd want to probably let hang. He ruins people's lives, and is wanted for killing his wife . She is found in her room disfigured around the hair, face, and neck. He swears he did not do it, but the salacious books he writes about others may have cost him an enemy ,or a hundred. I figured pretty fast what was happening , but it did not stop me from enjoying how they were going to solve it all. The latest book involves Lady Vespa, and Narraway, and Daniel's Father. Three people he has loved and admired. Finding the truth, and stopping the book before the special branch at the government is at risk, is just as important. The author weaves this all together so smoothly that your not confused. The book also brings up new inventions such as x-Ray machines, and a female that passes all her exams, but can still not be a doctor, and finger printing. The brutal treatment husbands could pass on to children, and their wives, was also looked at. They were considered property by evil men, who enjoyed being brutal bullies. They could not let him hang, but neither was he innocent. I loved the way they all worked it out ,because it was a punishment he certainly deserved. The author tied it up, and gave us a great ending. It was nice to hear about his sister, and to be in the Pitt home, though lots had changed in ten years. His father was still a,man to be admired, and his mom a knowing, loving lady, who had been involved in her husband's cases, before he became Special Branch, and worked to stop traitors, and bombers, or crimes against the Country of England. I like when books spread out to include family when they become grown. I was sad to learn about Lady Vespa, she was all Grace, and spirited, and I liked her husband Victor Narraway, who had trained Pitt, and recommended him. to take over special branch. Jumping ahead left lots of years that we missed in their lives.

Perry, from what I understand, is a prolific mystery writer. Lots of her mysteries feature the same main characters. In particular, she had a long running series featuring Charlotte and Thomas Pitt. Twenty-One Days is the first Daniel Pitt mystery. Daniel is Charlotte and Thomas' son. He is a young lawyer who is just starting out his practice at a prestigious London law firm. Perry does a great job with the historical setting of the novel. It is a 1910 Britain, and definitely has that feel. Crime solving is not what it is now. Forensic science is nascent. Women are still unable to vote. Domestic violence is not illegal. The novel starts out with Daniel winning a criminal case in which we was defending a man accused of murder. He successfully proves that the man was innocent by using the innovative for the day analysis of fingerprints. He then gets assigned to assist in another case. Here, a man is on trial for allegedly murdering his wife. The jury finds him guilty and he is due to be hanged in 21 days. So Daniel has that much time to prove the man is not guilty.I must say, the setup in this novel was brilliant. It really got me interested and engaged. I am usually not one for a cozy mystery. There is too much tea drinking and some portions of the story are too slow moving. However, this novel did have an interesting twist. Sections of it also gave me Downton Abbey vibes. Daniel goes to the accused man's house and spends some time with the servants there. The butler in particular seemed written from Carson in Downton Abbey. Another nice parallel with Downton Abbey is that the women in the novel are very Sybil-like, i.e. fiercely intelligent and not afraid to go against established conventions and fight for women's rights.Overall, I rated this novel 4 out of 5 stars.

Really wish if she had decided to start a new series she had come up with a new character completely unrelated to the Pitts. Kitteridge would have made a great main character and then the other \"new\" characters would make more sense.The book begins with Daniel defending Roman Blackwell for murder. Blackwell is obviously going to play a large role in the Daniel Pitt series along with his Mother Mercy, but they really don't make any sense. Blackwell is supposed to have been at Bow Street at the same time Thomas Pitt was, which would make him around the same age. His \"irregular\" conduct had Pitt suggesting he leave the police and start his own PI business. Supposedly they were friends (sounds a bit out of character for straight arrow Thomas Pitt) and when he is arrested for murder Thomas ask his son (fresh out of law school) to defend him. Against all odds Daniel wins the case. Roman's Mom, Mercy is grateful Daniel saved her son and in return offers to help him in any way she can. And her assistance will soon prove invaluable, but WHY DID DANIEL NEED IT??? Why wouldn't he have asked his Mother (Charlotte Pitt) or his Aunt Emily. And how is Mercy connected to society enough to be able to help?Daniel is sent by his boss Marcus fford Croft (I find the ff annoying) to assist Toby Kitteridge who is defending the famous biographer Graves against the charge he murdered his wife Ebony and disfigured her face so badly she is unrecognizable. Unfortunately Graves is found guilty and they have 21 days to find a reason to appeal the verdict before Graves is hanged. Graves hints to Daniel that Special Branch if framing him as he is in the process of writing a book about Victor Narraway and Vespasia that is less than flattering and could harm Thomas Pitt. We learn at this point that Narraway and Vespasia have been dead for some years. I have to admit I was crushed to learn they were dead and ANNOYED that we weren't given any details. We also learn that Jemma is married with children living in New York. No Explanation given for how she meet and married an American. Again ANNOYED. Daniel tells his Father about the biography, but Thomas really doesn't do anything. Daniel goes to Graves' home and talks with his staff and children, daughter Sarah (who Kitteridge has a thing for) and crippled son Arthur. He finds the manuscript (which he gets Roman and Mercy to help him go through to find names of people who will not want to see it published and have the power to stop it). Miriam fford Croft (Marcus' daughter) just happens to be a scientist (no degree because she is a woman) they get permission to exhume Ebony's body and Miriam soon concludes that it isn't Ebony in the grave. Miriam and Daniel confront Sarah and she admits her Mother is still alive and takes them to her. (Several references are made by various people that Miriam is almost old enough to be Daniel's Mother, but it does look like Perry is setting them up for a romance).After that the case is quickly solved. Perry seems to be on a streak of having bigamy play a role in the last Monk book and then in this one. Turns out Graves was married to Winifred and never divorced her, she found out he just inherited a title and land and she came to claim her place. she confronted Ebony and was accidentally killed. Seeing a way to escape from an abusive husband she disfigured Winifred's face and pretended to be dead."}], "description": "In this first book in a new series, Thomas Pitt's son Daniel races to save his client from execution, setting him against London's Special Police Branch.It's 1910, and Daniel Pitt is a reluctant lawyer who would prefer to follow in the footsteps of his detective father. When the biographer Russell Graves, who Daniel is helping defend, is sentenced to execution for the murder of his wife, Daniel's Pitt-family investigative instincts kick in, and he sets out to find the real killer. With only twenty-one days before Graves is to be executed, Daniel learns that Graves is writing a biography of Victor Narraway, the former head of Special Branch and a close friend of the Pitts. And the stories don't shed a positive light. Is it possible someone is framing Graves to keep him from writing the biography--maybe even someone Daniel knows in Special Branch? The only answer, it seems, lies in the dead woman's corpse. And so, with the help of some eccentric new acquaintances who don't mind bending the rules, Daniel delves into an underground world of dead bodies and double lives, unearthing scores of lies and conspiracies. As he struggles to balance his duty to the law with his duty to his family, the equal forces of justice and loyalty pull this lawyer-turned-detective in more directions than he imagined possible.
