It honors the men and women from the Ukraine who fought to keep living amid the ravages of a war they didn\u2019t ask for. It honors the memory of those whose lives were brutally snuffed out long before they\u2019d dreamed all their dreams. It honors those Germans and those Red Army soldiers who didn\u2019t let evil do their thinking for them but instead offered kindness and compassion and respect. And it reminds us living in our world today, where evil seems to dominate every news report, that \u201cfor all the evil, there is an awful lot of good.\u201dTold in three parts (The Beginning, The Darkness, Home) from the perspectives of several different characters, Like a River From Its Course immediately captivates and invests the reader in the lives of its main players. Ivan Kyrilovich and his family \u2013 Tanya, Sergei, Anna, and Maria. We meet them first, experiencing with them the terror that descended on Kiev, Ukraine on June 22, 1941 when Hitler violated the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and invaded the Soviet Union. As Maria states at the end of her first vignette, \u201cWe\u2019re at war. Nothing will be the same again.\u201d Frederick Herrmann \u2013 the Nazi soldier who lives to make his father \u2013 a friend of Hitler\u2019s \u2013 proud. He wants to be a part of history, though by the time it\u2019s over he might advise comrades with similar goals to be careful what they wish for. Ludmilla Michaelevna \u2013 her story may be the most tragic of all the characters we meet on these pages and at the same time perhaps the one filled with the most hope.These are the main narrators in this novel that is rich with history and imagery. Ivan. Maria (\u201cMasha\u201d). Frederick. Ludmilla (\u201cLuda\u201d). But no man is an island and no character here is either. Embroidered into the fabric of each of these beautifully haunting lives is a network of family and friends and associates who leap just as vividly off the page and into your heart. Some will warm your heart. Others will break it. But they will all etch themselves there to stay.Like a River From Its Course shows us the very worst of humanity as well as the very best. And for a large chunk of the novel, hope seems a very distant thing. But in the middle of the darkness, light breaks through. Quietly. Gently. Persistently. In the resiliency of a people. In the power of love. In the words of a babushka. In the faith of a priest. To be honest, at first I wasn\u2019t sure faith would factor much into this book at all. But oh my heart. When it arrived, it did so with triumph and in such a way that I may never be the same.I know that several quotes from the book will be rolling around in my heart for a long time, my spirit pondering them and reflecting on their truth and wisdom. They are just as timely for today as they are for the dark days of WW2. It is the kind of book that continues to breathe deep inside you long after you\u2019ve closed the last page. In Like A River From Its Course, Kelli Stuart gives us a glimpse into a part of WW2 we don\u2019t often see \u2013 the beautiful people of the Ukraine, their courage, their hope, and their faith.

Their stories show us the worst of humanity as well as the very best but most of all their life highlights the resiliency of a people, their courage, their hope, their faith and the power of love for family, friends and strangers.Although this is fiction, the circumstances and horrors the people faced were very real. The population was scared, starving and dying. A well- known horror happened in September 1941, when 34,000 Jews were massacred at Babi Yar by the German forces and local collaborators.

Kelli Stuart draws you in from the first moment. There is a lot of World War 2 fiction out there, so it's impressive and refreshing to find in this novel a lesser-known slice of that history. The Ukrainian experience is compelling and heart-rending, and explored with such rich detail. The characters are deftly drawn and shaded, and achingly believable.

These moments are moving and are amazing to read, because these people never gave up.The author made their stories come alive.

But if I had to express my thoughts in only one sentence, it would be this: If ever a book cried out to be read, it\u2019s this one. What\u2019s most amazing is that through extensive research, debut author Kelli Stuart has drawn from personal stories of survival to write this moving work of fiction, based on historical events that weren\u2019t that familiar to me \u2013 the Nazi occupation of the Ukraine. The story is told from the first-person perspective of four main characters \u2013 and rather than me trying to describe them, I encourage you to read about them in the book\u2019s overview above if you haven\u2019t already. Here are some expressions of their thoughts . . .Frederick: \u201cEnding one life to preserve another is not killing. It is saving.\u201dIvan: \u201cSometimes horrors are too great to be put into words.\u201dLuda: \u201cWhen you grow up without love, accepting it becomes almost burdensome.\u201dMasha: \u201cI\u2019m scarred and emotionally beaten. The girl who left was swept away in the flood of war, but I think that girl is still somewhere inside. If only I could get back to find her.\u201dLike a River from Its Course is riveting, dark, raw, yet hopeful and redeeming. It reflects the essence of humanity, from total depravity to selfless, tender kindness. It\u2019s not a light read, nor is it an easy one \u2013 but it is compelling, relevant for today, and hard to put down. Truly unforgettable.I\u2019m amazed at the literary quality of Kelli\u2019s writing, for it sparkles in its beauty. She has a gift for pulling you right into the story, compelling you to experience the people, setting, and all the horrors of war in a way that is palpable. I marked several quotes that really spoke to me; here are just a few . . .\u201cIf love gives flight to the soul, hate kills it completely.\u201d (Ivan)\u201cYou would be surprised, my friend, at the power in believing in something outside of yourself.

This is one of- if not the most-heartbreaking books I've ever read. Compiled from true stories, Like A River From Its Course tells the story of a part of WWII and the German invasion of the Ukraine through four different characters, each effected by the war in their own personal way. The chapters are short and tell the story from the alternating viewpoints of a Ukrainian father, his fourteen-year-old daughter, a young German officer, and a sixteen-year-old orphaned Ukrainian girl. Most books with alternating viewpoints and chapters like these are hard to keep up with, but I barely noticed with this book! I also read this relatively thick book in only two days- it was that captivating. Like any book about war, it is grim, sad and at times, hard to read. However, anyone who has an interest in WWII would enjoy this sad and heartbreaking- yet beautiful- account of war, love, heartache, redemption, forgiveness, and faith. A brief note: the book does contain some war violence, as well as a few other slightly disturbing scenes.

In this sweeping historical saga, Kelli Stuart takes the reader on a captivating journey into the little\u2013known history of Ukraine\u2019s tragedies through the eyes of four compelling characters who experience the same story from different perspectives.Maria Ivanovna is only fourteen when the bombing begins and not much older when she is forced into work at a German labor camp. She must fight to survive and to make her way back to her beloved Ukraine.Ivan Kyrilovich is falsely mistaken for a Jew and lined up with 34,000 other men, women, and children who are to be shot at the edge of Babi Yar, the \u201ckilling ditch.\u201d He survives, but not without devastating consequences.Luda is sixteen when German soldiers rape her. Now pregnant with the child of the enemy, she is abandoned by her father, alone, and in pain. She must learn to trust family and friends again and find her own strength in order to discover the redemption that awaits.Frederick Hermann is sure in his knowledge that the F\u00fchrer\u2019s plans for domination are right and just. He is driven to succeed by a desire to please a demanding father and by his own blind faith in the ideals of Nazism. Based on true stories gathered from fifteen years of research and interviews with Ukrainian World War II survivors, Like a River from Its Course is a story of love, war, heartache, forgiveness, and redemption.In reality Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939 signed the German-Soviet Aggression Pact in which the two countries agreed to take no military action against each other for ten years. In 1941 Hitler violated that pact launching Operation Barbarossa, an invasion of the Soviet Union. In September 1941 the decision to kill all the Jews in Kiev was made and almost 34,000 were killed at the Babi Yar. Let me start out by stating that this is a terrific story. It is everything that it could be all rolled up into one terrific package. It is a World War II thriller. It is a story that shows us the depths that a human soul can sink to but it also shows us the heights that the human soul can rise to. Ms. Stuart has given us a historical fiction which means that the events actually happened it is just that she has fictionalized them. Ms. Stuart has given us marvelous, well-written characters that you will get involved with Maria, Ivan, Luda and Frederick. This story will have you flipping pages as fast as you can read them. I believe you are going to enjoy this book and our heroine and that you are not going to want to put it down until you have finished it! It is just that good.

Gripping. Evocative. Raw. This isn't a novel for the faint of heart, but it is one that deserves to be read and celebrated in memory of the many victims and survivors of the atrocities inflicted on the Ukrainian people by a brutal Nazi regime.  Heartbreaking tales told from the perspective of four main characters. The first person, present tense narrative isn't my favourite point of view to read, but it worked really well in this instance. Rushed me right into scenes that felt so urgent I was left holding my breath and gritting my teeth for most of the read.  The author has done extensive research and these four lives are inspired by true stories of real survivors. That's what makes this book so startling, I think -- the fact that events like these actually happened. That real people survived and lived to bear witness to what happened to them and those they loved. Yes, Like a River from its Course is a sombre read. My heart was heavy when I finally closed the book. I couldn't help but make parallels to the modern world we live in and am still wondering if we have actually learned anything from that horrid war and the actions of the maniac who started it all. That's why books like this one -- the kind that reach into a reader's heart to testify of both pain and hope -- are so important. At the time of the German occupation, Ukraine had already born the ravages of a revolution that destroyed their churches. Priests were killed or sent to work camps in Siberia, churches turned into public buildings so the spiritual landscape is bleak at the start of this novel. But the author still manages to incorporate a soul-stirring faith thread in the midst of turbulence and heartache.\"We are openly discussing God in a place that not so long ago killed many of my friends for similar conversations. God cannot be suppressed under the evil of man. The world is harsh and cruel and full of pain. But God is real. The Holy Spirit and Mary and the saints -- they're real. To believe is to trust, and when you trust, your life has meaning and purpose outside of the mere endurance of hardship.\" (p. 263) And perhaps my most favourite quote from a longsuffering, all-believing priest: \"You would be surprised, my friend, at the power in believing in something outside of yourself. When you acknowledge that the pain of this world is unbearable, you're able to finally surrender to the One who alone is worthy of carrying the weight.\" (p. 263) Startling truths and riveting fiction.

The tragedies and horrors that unfold as the Germans invade the Ukraine are reflected through four characters experiencing a myriad of emotions and reactions. Three of the narrators are Russian citizens and one is a young German Nazi. The author personalizes the stories in such a way as to cause the reader to experience events as the characters do. I felt the horror. I felt the fear. And later, I also felt the hope. The book is well-written and obviously well-researched. Though the characters were fictional, their experiences were compiled from those of real people. The reader feels this in the way the stories are told. My only complaint is that I was left hungry for more information. Stuart obviously knew the history of the Babi Yar event quite well, but it was also clear that she knew other historical truths about the war in the Ukraine that she only shared a bit of in the book. The Ukrainian nationalists or rebels were mentioned only once when a character expresses the opinion that they were worse than the Nazis. The author also mentions, almost as an aside, that some in the Red Army could be trusted and others could not. No other details were given about this, and I was disappointed that the author didn\u2019t share more. While each character is fully fleshed out and their experiences detailed and well-told, the overall war raging around them was not always as clear. Nevertheless, it was a fascinating, emotional read that kept me turning the pages well into the night. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in WWII historical fiction.

Deep. Gripping. Raw. Powerful. It's all of those things. This is the type of story that brings history to life in a way we comprehend it at its most basic level. We live it. We see it, feel it, taste it, hear it, and touch it. It's not pretty. It's not romantic - although there is a thread of romance weaving its way between the tragedies - and it's not sugar-coated. This is \nreal.\n And maybe that's the best single word to describe it.The story is told from four different points of view. One is Ukrainian father who is trying to keep his family together and help his neighbors. One is his daughter, the youngest and most head-strong of his brood. One is a Ukrainian teenage girl whose alcoholic father abandons her to the Nazis. And the last is the son of a high-ranking German Nazi officer who only wants to earn his father's approval. I'm not going to leave any typical summary of this book. It's too complicated, too rich, to condense into a 15-second commercial review. This book should be a must-read for every high school World History course. Instead of teaching the atrocities of WWII as geography, dates, and the names of the generals, we should be teaching what the war did at the level of basic human existence. Maybe if we did. Maybe if more people understood what the Greatest Generation fought - and why - they wouldn't be so quick to condemn those who would step in quickly to prevent another such atrocity.

The stories that unravel are enticing. Before I knew it, I had a significant portion of the book finished and it seemed like time had stood still for me while I visited Kiev. Of course, it hadn't, but it felt like it. World War II novels are very dear to my heart, as you may have seen, and that's why I simply couldn't pass this gem up. Like a River From its Course is challenging to read at times, due to the realistic horrors Ms. Stuart writes about. She does however keep everything to kind of a PG-13 level and doesn't go further. I appreciated the new perspective on the war from the Ukrainians, it was a different look. They faced horrible things like many other countries. Ms. Stuart's characters are resilient, but beautifully human too. Each character has their own problem or heartache to overcome. Sadly, some make it and some do not. But the ones that do make it, find themselves happier and more at peace. The story as a whole was very inspirational and I would recommend it to any one who enjoys WWII stories like myself. Through the gloom and despair of the times, there was hope. There was light. I think Ms. Stuart did a fantastic job.

So as I started the novel from Kelli Stuart I simply was pulled into the lives of the characters based on her visit to the Ukraine in 2003. There Kelli met a real people who lived through times of trial and heartache, learning to live again when the insanity of Hitler\u2019s regime was finally over.I love the way the author moved the story along by introducing four main characters each with their own chapter and dates. As I read, I couldn\u2019t put the book down because as a reader the author tells a compelling story that looks at the life of individuals in the scenes with the war as the backdrop. There were many brave, courageous and daring people who faced life with raw honesty and in many ways counted the cost of their choices, doing whatever was required to stay alive.Readers will read about a father and his daughter, a Nazi soldier who is but a boy, and a girl whose abusive father throws her out of his house to live amongst the wolves. It touched my heart and wasn\u2019t hard to mentally envision real people suffering for lack of the basic needs or from the abuse of either the German Army or the Red Army.My heart and mind will long remember this novel because it is written about the humans we are, both the good and the evil. I will remember the old woman character who teaches a young woman with a son how to be ready to face the world not by looking inward, but at what others are living with or through during the war. I will remember the love of parent s that lost their sons during the fighting and the depth of their grief described. I will remember how at one point the parents who never had any training in or were taught about God are now seeking to see if He is indeed real. Or the Jewish girl who knew she had to help another girl reach a new life before her captors might snuff out her life.I hope you read this novel and share it with family and friends as well as visit the author\u2019s website. There you will read what she did while in the Ukraine and who she talked to. I think how wonderful God gave her that moment to get their stories before they passed away as they left words of wisdom and a life with a testimony. I pray we will all be as faithful to God even in our times of not understanding, grief or some other experience. I pray too that we leave behind a legacy that will spur others to be courageous in the face of evil, be there for those who are downtrodden and teach others about the God we love and serve!Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

In this sweeping historical saga, Kelli Stuart takes the reader on a captivating journey into the little--known history of Ukraine's tragedies through the eyes of four compelling characters who experience the same story from different perspectives.Maria Ivanovna is only fourteen when the bombing begins and not much older when she is forced into work at a German labor camp. She must fight to survive and to make her way back to her beloved Ukraine.Ivan Kyrilovich is falsely mistaken for a Jew and lined up with 34,000 other men, women, and children who are to be shot at the edge of Babi Yar, the \"killing ditch.\" He survives, but not without devastating consequences.Luda is sixteen when German soldiers rape her. Now pregnant with the child of the enemy, she is abandoned by her father, alone, and in pain. She must learn to trust family and friends again and find her own strength in order to discover the redemption that awaits.Frederick Hermann is sure in his knowledge that the Fuhrer's plans for domination are right and just. He is driven to succeed by a desire to please a demanding father and by his own blind faith in the ideals of Nazism. Based on true stories gathered from fifteen years of research and interviews with Ukrainian World War II survivors, Like a River from Its Course is a story of love, war, heartache, forgiveness, and redemption.My Review:Maria \"Masha\" Ivanovna find's herself in a work camp with little food and people around her dying left and right. But with the help of a nice German solider maybe she will see her family again one day.Ivan Kyrilovich will never forget the girl he couldn't protect. He vows not to let the same happen to his daughters, but to soon the German's take his daughters from him and take them to God knows where.Fredrick Herrmann, a German solider, wants to think he makes his father proud. Truth be told his father wishes Fredrick would have died instead of his brother.Ludmilla \"Luda\" Michaelevna's father has always been a drunk. She believed he never has really cared for her, but is shocked when he leaves her in the hands of three German soldiers.Like A River From It's Course is an amazing book. This book will have you so entranced by the stories. I really enjoyed reading this book and found it to be a wonderful read. This is definitely now a favorite of mine. These stories correspond with the history of World War II.

This is one of those books. It is powerful, emotional and full of passion. I cried, smiled and my heart broke at various times throughout the book. I was so attached when I first opened this book, it came with me to soccer practice and I read it the whole time we were there. It was definitely a book I read in one sitting and then re-read over again to further appreciate it.It tells the story of four individuals all of whom are living during World War II in Ukraine, this gives us such a unique and different perspective of the same events. There was so much to learn from this book, the \"killing ditch\" was nothing I had ever heard of before but it broke my heart and made me physically sick to think of something so awful that these individuals went through. Reading through the chapters in Frederick's perspective was so difficult at times. The acts were horrible and you can see the toll they take on him. I thought this was a very interesting perspective to look at, the effects of these acts on the person committing the crime and how long-term they changes their view, faith and beliefs.In all of the ugliness and dark parts in this book, there are moments of human kindness, compassion and understanding that make you see the good in the world. Ivan is one of those men that make you see the good in people, even though it cost him greatly. He also loses his children to the labor camps but still he finds a way to fight to see the light in it.Maria is an amazingly strong young woman, her character and compassion made me believe in people again. She was the glue that kept many going. She gave so many hope that needed it. Luda is another amazing character in our story. While being victim to an awful crime, she accepts the pregnancy and loves her child. And while she was abandoned by her own Father, she found family in another family whose connections to her own she never knew. Watching her grow through pregnancy and eventually into motherhood and struggle with not only this but the war around her, brings hope and forgiveness.The story is an amazing blend of hope, pain and forgiveness. With moments of horrendous pain and suffering, we are also balanced with moments of kindness and compassion that will make you belief again in humanity. This novel is powerful, touching, moving and very special. You will not regret one moment spent with it and share with your friends."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7411206-suzanne", "userReview": "The historical fiction lover in me is always excited to read that an author spent years gathering material and talking to people who lived through these horrific events of WWII in before crafting a novel from those stories. The time and effort spent in writing this story is immeasurable and my hat is off to Kelli Stuart for her dedication to \"getting the story right\" as I've heard it put. There's a quote in the acknowledgements that spoke to me before I'd even read the first word of the book itself. \"The characters in this book are composites of the hundreds of men and women I met while touring Ukraine. They don't tell one single person's story, but rather hundreds of stories combined.\" -Kelli StuartThat quote stayed with me while I read the stories of Masha, Ivan, Frederick, and Luda. Another quote during one of Frederick's sections of the book resonated with me as well. Frederick said, \"We're not just a part of history. We are history.\" How true that was then and how true it is today.There is so much that goes on with each person that's so raw and heartbreaking that I honestly don't want to spoil a bit of it by giving you any more than what's included in the book summary. I'd be lying if I didn't admit that this was hard to read at times and I had to put it down and come back to it after taking some time to process the horrific events that happened to so many during that time in history. If you like historically accurate fiction with nothing sugarcoated you'll probably love this. If you prefer your historical fiction with a little more sunshine and rainbows then this will push your boundaries but sometimes we all need to step outside our reading comfort zone.NOTE: Like A River From Its Course by Kelli Stuart is a book that you have to be ready for when you begin reading it. If you aren't prepared to read about the \"killing ditch\", murder, and rape then I'd suggest putting this one down and coming back to it when you can stomach that. She doesn't gloss over the raw horror that these four characters lived through.I received this book free of charge from Litfuse Publicity Group in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8435102-joan", "userReview": "Stuart has written a good novel covering many of the aspects of the Germans invading Russia, specifically Ukraine. The novel presents well the inhumane nature of the war. Women and girls were raped. People were shot indiscriminately. For the Nazis, life had little value.But there were some Germans, and soldiers, who did not get taken in by the Nazi philosophy. Some understood that there were different ways to think and the value of mankind was more than just the Nazi ideal. (317) Stuart also takes us into the mind of a soldier who obeys his orders to kill but has nightmares that haunt him. While there is much cruelty portrayed in the novel, there are also tender relationships presented.There were a couple aspects of the novel that I found difficult. One was writing in the present tense. I found that reading the present tense was not as comfortable for me and detracted from the pace of the novel. Also, the novel is written from the first person viewpoints of the four characters. I found that a bit confusing. I would have liked to have had a list of characters at the beginning of the book. I had to try to remember the character again, after reading the first person accounts of the other three characters in between. There were times when I felt like I was reading four individual novels.I would have also liked to have had an afterward in the book that explained which parts of the novel were based on historical fact. The author did inform reviewers by email that many of the experiences in the novel were based on stories from people she met while visiting Kiev as a teen. Much of the novel, therefore, is based on actual experience.This is a good novel of WW II. It portrays the horror of the time as well as some of the heroes. Even though I found some aspects of the novel lacking I do recommend it as a moving account of a terrible time in our past.I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of an independent and honest review."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10151762-leah", "userReview": "Like a Rive From Its Course is a Holocaust novel. Unlike many that I've read, the book begins in the Ukraine and opens with the horrific event of Babi Yar- the \"killing ditch.\" All of the Jews in the city were rounded up and shot over a ditch dug in the cemetery- 34,000 men, women, and children.The author of Like a River From Its Course found her inspiration on a mission trip to the Ukraine when she was in high school. There she fell in love with the Russian culture and language. And when she returned a second time she met Maria Ivanovna. Maria told Kelli her story of living in the Ukraine during the war and of Babi Yar and her father's survival of the infamous slaughter.Maria's story led to Kelli's further research. Like a River From Its Course is a culmination of Maria's story along with stories from other survivors Kelli met along the way.The story is told from the perspective of four characters. I wasn't sure how this was going to work at first, as with each character change, the characters speak in first person. I quickly realized, however, that not only could I follow just fine, but that the style allowed me to be swept up in the life of each of these four characters.From Babi Yar to other horrific acts during German occupation to a concentration camp in Germany itself, the story sweeps readers along in the emotions and experiences of each of the characters.There were definitely times the stories were difficult to read. And there were times I could cheer for the courage of those who tried to stand up and do what was right during this awful time.Like a Rive From Its Course is beautiful. It's a beautiful story told in the words of those who lived it. You cannot read it and walk away unchanged.Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book for review purposes.

This novel is based on years of research and interviews with many survivors of World War II in the Ukraine. We always hear of Poland, France, and other countries which endured many deaths and hardships during the Nazi occupation, but not much about the Ukranian people. Perhaps it is because there were also deaths and hardships wrought by the Bolsheviks in that region and the take-over by the Red Army was part of it.Even though reading some of the stories was hard to take, knowing that these stories were true was horrifying. I am always shocked when hearing or reading about man\u2019s inhumanity to man and sickened when reading about these atrocities. The portrayal of Babi Yar, the \u201ckilling ditch\u201d where thousands of lives were lost was truly disturbing. I cannot fathom how young men could be as callous and faithless as to systematically murder innocent men, women and children. There was no compassion at all\u2026and this because a madman declared himself the Fuhrer.I wonder what we would do under such circumstances today. Of course, we Americans have not seen such on our soil, but it does continue to happen in other countries, Syria, African countries, Iraq, Iran and others. We have yet to openly confront this repeat of history. What can we do? This novel has caused me to think more in depth about what is going on in the world today and what we can do to stop the atrocities from continuing. The innocents should not have to endure this.
