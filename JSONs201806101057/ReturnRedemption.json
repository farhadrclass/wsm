I don't really expect much of this series other than to entertain, give me some sighable romantic moments and perhaps teach a few thought-worthy christian principles. The first two delivered as promised. However, the resolution in Return was just a little too quick and pat for me. Towards the end of the book every conversation was one that the characters had already had at least two or three times before. And I really couldn't get past a particularly annoying product placement reference. Were Kingsbury and Smalley getting some travel perks from priceline.com? If not, they should have to make up for the lameness of the reference."}, {"userName": "Oni P\u00eenzariu", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51725241-oni-p-nzariu", "userReview": "Genial\u0103 \u0219i asta.

Luke's character is the baby of the family, and she chiseled him so well in these stories. I was so excited years ago when I learned he had a book where his story was center. I loved revisiting him! What would you feel like if everything you ever believed in was ripped away in one tragic instant? That's what Luke battles and I was so angry with him for so long in this book! I found myself on more than one occasion wanting to throw the book across the room. But, in trademark Kingsbury fashion, she weaved messages of hope, forgiveness, understanding and acceptance into her pages, and it wrapped me up instantly. Luke's story is a powerful one and I will forever love it. This book should be able to get more than a simple 5 star rating. This book is emotional, utterly raw and absolutely breathtaking. The characters are now your family, the lessons are yours. All of it wrap up to make one unforgettable novel in a sweep-you-off-your-feet series. Ms. Kingsbury's shelf is graced with Luke's story and when someone asks me my favorites, his will always be one of the first to slip off the shelf. Well done, once again, on another amazing addition to this incredible family story. *I purchased this book for my personal collection.

So I'm not going to read the other two books in this series because the events and circumstances that take place in this family are looking less like every-day life. Where the first book began with one uncomplicated yet heartbreaking plot twist, this book leaves off with a number of inexplicable open ends. And despite their flaws, the characters are still too perfect--especially the men (Ryan Taylor, Landon Blake). They are like fairy-tale princes. They are always there to say the right thing, never use irony or sarcasm, and even remember to put coasters down under their water glasses. Kingsbury's prose becomes a little lazy by this book, too. She relies too heavily upon cliches and dead phrases such as \"a piece of her heart was missing,\" \"his thoughts swirled around him like a whirlwind,\" etc. I feel a bit like that kid in the Princess Bride (\"Woah, woah, woah--is this a kissing book?\") because of all the descriptions of Landon's kisses and how filled they are with passion, longing, tenderness, love, trust. Blegh. Stop now, please. So why give it four stars? Because it is a page-turner, and I appreciate what Kingsbury is trying to do. She wants to show God's faithfulness in peoples' lives. I would have preferred a single novel, however, a smaller story that revolved around a few people and showed them with greater depth instead of a large web of characters whose lives intersect in increasingly ridiculous ways."}, {"userName": "Bekah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25766853-bekah", "userReview": "Return is the story of Luke Baxter, the youngest of the family and also the only son of John and Elizabeth Baxter. 9/11 truly changed Luke's life forever. Now he's certain that God doesn't even exist, and if He does, He doesn't care. After attending several \"free-thinking\" meetings based on humanism, Luke decides that there's nothing more to this life than random coincidences. I really enjoyed this story. Luke Baxter's faith had never been tried by fire before and he firmly believed that if a person was obeying the Lord and doing everything God asks of him, then God will give him everything he wants. What he doesn't understand is that sometimes God says no.Reagan lost her father in 9/11 and she lives with regret and guilt that she didn't answer her father's phone call the night before. After hearing of Luke's bad decisions, she decides not to tell him that she's pregnant with their son. After nearly losing her life and her baby's, she struggles with deciding whether or not to tell Luke about the baby. I really liked Reagan. Even though she and Luke had made a bad decision and through the pain of losing her father, her faith held strong.I was really content with the end of this story when Luke realizes that there is a God in heaven and even if he might not completely understand why God allowed 9/11, he realizes that He does care and that there is a last day on earth for everybody."}, {"userName": "Cydnie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742779-cydnie", "userReview": "The baby of the Baxter family, Luke, has left his family and all he has ever believed. Can and will the 'prodigal son' return?  One thing that I found to be 'painted' so clearly in this book was the fact that Luke has become a \"free thinker\"- think outside the box, do whatever feels right at the moment, if you want to be involved with more than one person at a time that's okay, let go of those 'archaic-religious-strangling' morals that you've been raised with. etc... Luke is adamant that his family should accept the new him and his lifestyle; but, he is totally unaccepting of them. He wants to say whatever he wants, but they are to keep their opinions to themselves. I have seen this in so many situations in life and society. Those who break away from the norm so that they can be 'free and accepting of new ideas', but are in fact very closed-minded toward anyone who doesn't agree with them. I am very curious now to finish the series. Many changes have come over the various members of the family. The underlying question stays the same, \"How strong is our faith when tested?\" Is our faith like a deep lake that can withstand rain and drought alike? or is it more like the temporary lake that shows up after a hard rain has overloaded the drain system- and just as quickly disappears after the storm?"}, {"userName": "Ashley Montgomery", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17990164-ashley-montgomery", "userReview": "This book focuses on Luke, the only boy in the Baxter family. In book #2, Luke was very quick to judge and say when someone was \"right\" or \"wrong.\" In this novel, 9/11 has happened and has had an affect on everyone. Throughout the book, there is a big \"secret\" no one is aware of that has caused Luke to question and challenge everything he has ever believed in, including his religion. -After thinking he has lost Reagan forever, he quickly moves on to another girl and ends up living with her to try to fill the \"void\" in his life. This is another child that has caused John and Elizabeth to go to their knees in prayer together and pray for his protection and guidance.

All the drama and emotion of your favorite daytime TV show, but with heavy-handed religious overtones. Yes, there are unwed mothers, but they see the error of their ways. People lose their faith, but others pray for them to return to the fold. In this audio version, God has a deep female voice, I guess because the reader is a woman, and He speaks to Luke, the errant sheep of the Baxter fold. Quite unexpected \u2013 having God actually speak to you, out loud, in English. Ashley hears devastating medical news, but I have a feeling that somehow, things will work out for her. This is the third book in the series. It\u2019s not as good as the first two.

At this point, there are three main protagonists, Kari, Ashley and Luke. Luke's story is the main story of this book. He has really spun off into rebellion against his parents, God, and all that he formerly held dear. At the same time, in New York, his former girlfriend is pregnant with his child. Will he ever find out about the child? Will he ever turn back to God? Will he ever reconcile with his family?At the same time, we see glimpses of Kari and Ryan's life as they prepare for their wedding day. This is a really great payoff from the indecision and hesitancy that plagued their relationship throughout the first two books.The other main character that we are graced with in this book is Ashley. Her and Landon's relationship continues to develop and hits a major speed bump or two. After all, they are in different cities and at different places in their lives. Will they ever actually get together?I enjoyed this book, but I found it to be a little melodramatic. Ashley and Landon's story took up a good piece of the book, and I find it emotionally exhausting. Every time I think they're finally going to be happy, some other reason comes up that they can't be together. I'm hoping for some resolution in the next book because we didn't get it here, and the fact that there relationship is so melodramatic is a main reason that I had difficulty enjoying this book as much as the first two in this series.I did find Luke's story to be interesting and I am glad that it has reached some resolution. I felt like his issues with faith and God were tied up a little too quickly and easily. As someone with a naturally skeptical nature, I did not find it to be believable, and I had doubts that Luke really had the faith doubts that he displays in the book because of how quick and tidy the resolution was. I also did not find the comparison with Peter to be believable for someone who is having faith doubts. However, I will grant that perhaps this is the author's way of showing us that perhaps instead of doubts, perhaps Peter just had some rebellious and unhappy feelings toward God. I always felt like Peter's denials were more of the \"I need to save myself\" type than the actual doubt in Jesus as his Messiah. That's just my interpretation though.This book also introduces Brooke as the next major character in this series, and I am hoping that her story is great. I am also hoping to finally see some resolution on Ashley and Landon and an end to their exhausting drama in the next book."}, {"userName": "Anne Marie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11986319-anne-marie", "userReview": "Wonderful read about the Baxter family. John and Elizabeth Baxter hold it all together while worrying about each of their children, as well as rejoicing with them in the happy moments. Luke is still struggling with his new beliefs of there not being a God. He\u2019s still living with Lori, and attending free thinkers talks and living a care-free lifestyle. Also an open-relationship lifestyle. Lori apparently has a fling with a guy from a meeting, gets pregnant, and has an abortion without telling Luke about it. When Lori gets an infection and is admitted to the hospital, John Baxter, being a doctor there, finds out what is going on with her. John can\u2019t believe that Luke isn\u2019t there with her! So he goes to talk to Luke, where Luke is completely clueless about what is going on. He gets into an argument with his father, goes to see Lori, and life moves on. Ashley is able to find a gallery in New York City that will sell her paintings. She\u2019s also able to surprise Landon who is working there as a fire fighter. But she sees Landon and Luke\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Reagan, walking with a baby. At first, Ashley has all sorts of thoughts going through her head. But she realizes the truth...Landon loves her. She finds out that Landon was on a call to Reagan\u2019s apartment when an ambulance was called due to her bleeding heavily. Reagan and the baby, Thomas Luke, survive and Landon not only visits her, but also at the request of her mother, tells Reagan due to the damage of her uterus, she can no longer have children. Landon feels bad about the unfortunate things that have happened to Reagan, so he\u2019s being a friend and hanging out with her and the baby. When Ashley finds out the baby is her nephew, she goes to visit her. Ashley promises Reagan she won\u2019t tell Luke. Reagan does wind up telling Luke...but only because life has changed for her in an instant. A call from Paris reveals Cole\u2019s father is dying of aids. Ashley should get tested for HIV. She does, and is positive. She refuses Landon\u2019s marriage proposal, and thinks telling Luke everything is the right thing to do, which it is. Luke completely turns his life around when he visits Reagan and his son. Luke goes to the Baxter family picnic and apologizes to his family. They welcome him back with open arms. Kari and Ryan finally get married. Erin and Sam move to Texas. Brooke and Peter are arguing.

It just wasn't that engaging to me. Also I was a bit frustrated to see yet another spiritual issue introduced with someone else in the family.The melodrama in this series is really hard for me. Five kids all of whom either have a serious marital crisis involving considering divorce or separation, or got pregnant out of wedlock (or got girlfriend pregnant), or were unbelievers as adults, or some combination of the above. It's well past the point that it's plausible that this many things could go wrong despite Christian parents raising their kids right.
