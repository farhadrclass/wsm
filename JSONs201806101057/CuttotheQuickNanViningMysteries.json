Nan and her partner and former lover, Jim Kissick, get called to the sight of a gruesome murder. A local businessman and his girlfriend are the victims. The man was dismembered, the woman 's neck broken, and their bodies posed in a macabre way. So begins their next investigation. This book is filled with several twists and a couple of secondary stories that are neatly tied together at the end. We also learn more about Nan' s attack where she was ambushed, was stabbed in the neck, and actually flat lined for two minutes. She received a pearl necklace from the attacker and was able to tie it to another police officer's murder. The woman's husband got a similar necklace after her death. In this one, Nan continues her hunt for the man, who sends her a chilling message regarding her daughter. Enjoyed the suspense and as before, loved the characters. Kissick continues to try and renew their relationship, although he discovers Nan is keeping secrets from him. Very good. Looking forward to reading the next one."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3323590-karen", "userReview": "I enjoyed this but not as much as the first in the series.I am not enjoying the continued threat of T. B. Mann as much as the actual police job that she does.Since the T. B. Mann issue is not resolved in this book, I guess that book three will continue this thread.Her descriptions of the Salton Sea area are wonderful. The shootout scenes at the end were more easily followed than most similar scenes in other mysteries. I could have done without the snake attack, so be warned if this is also a problem of yours.I borrowed a copy from the public library."}, {"userName": "Noria", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2417138-noria", "userReview": "So, this is the second volume with Detective Nan Vining. I haven't read the first volume but it didn't really matter.The book's okay, the brutal murder is based on the concept of Strangers on a Train but with nice twists. The characters are also okay.I read the German translation and some things irked me a lot:1.The emergency telephone number 911 was changed to 110 (the German emergency telephone number for the police). But why? I would've understood if this book had been published in the 1950s when people in Germany didn't know that much about the US. But nowadays, we are flowed with American crime shows and movies where the 911 is mentioned all the time and for people who watch those shows/movies and read those books, it is common knowledge. It just feels stupid that an American cop calls a German emergency phone number.2.The translation for \"All work and now play make Jack a dull boy\" is okay but why, oh why, is it rhyming? It is a proverb, yes, but not all proverbs form a rhyme.Those were just the two facts that irked me the most, there were some more and I know, should I ever continue read this series of books, I'll read it the original version."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/439656-ruth", "userReview": "Synopsis: The crime scene was like something out of a horror movie. Billboard tycoon Oliver Mercer has been brutally slain in his home in the Pasadena hills, joined in death by his long-legged trophy girlfriend-both of their bodies displayed in a chilling tableau. The murder scene reawakens terrible memories for homicide detective Nan Vining, who survived her own harrowing attack a year earlier. While tracking the taunting gameplayer her daughter Emily dubbed T. B. Mann-The Bad Man-she is now working the Mercer case alongside her ex-flame Jim Kissick, stirring up conflicted feelings in her. From the ritzy estates of L.A.'s Lamborghini-driving set to a rocky desert outpost where rattlesnakes whisper murder, Nan will risk both her badge and her heart on a case that cuts close to the bone. Book 2. Enjoy the characters flaws and all, but I can't attach to Nan."}, {"userName": "jill", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/275015-jill", "userReview": "The mystery actually solved in the course of the novel was pretty boring -- sort of Strangers on a Train with a cross dresser. This is apparently part of a series in which the female detective is dealing with a serial killer who attempted to murder her. The parts of the book that dealt with that plot were more interesting than the other mystery, but the detective didn't really interest me enough to want to pick up another of these. Mainly because she had a weird, almost sexual focus on her attempted murderer that skeeved me out."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/404400-jamie", "userReview": "Mistakenly purchased this download thinking it was the first book in the Julian Kestrel series. It's not. Rich in detail about the LA area -- too rich. I don't really need to know what highway exit was taken, and whether the character turned left or right. I did enjoy the descriptions of the Salton Sea. The plot just seemed kind of pointless, there's no big mystery, and the main character is still obsessing at the end of this book over the bad man (i.e. T.B. Mann) who attacked her in the first book."}, {"userName": "Jennie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37908108-jennie", "userReview": "This is the second book in a trilogy about Nan Vining.
