There are videos in which Nicky Gumbel preaches about Gods love for us and how He wants to be in our lives and to have a deep relationship with us. Nicky brought me closer to God on that Alpha course, and he still inspires me today, that's why I've read, and would recommend his books including this one! Life isn't perfect, but at least we can be put on the right track again by reading Nicky's wise words. Life can be painful - but so is God!!"}, {"userName": "Louise Douglas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7740112-louise-douglas", "userReview": "http://louiser89.com/2016/01/19/nicky..."}, {"userName": "Clare Khan", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18643315-clare-khan", "userReview": "I have always respected Nicky Gumbel. I like the way he writes the most important things for life with a humorous, easy-to-understand manner."}], "description": "Our culture is obsessed with lifestyle. The media tells us what to wear, how to get fit, what to drive and how to love. Everyone wants to tell us how to live our lives. Jesus didn't leave us a lifestyle magazine, he showed people how to live. These 18 chapters examine Jesus' Sermon on the Mount from the BIble and the radical alternative it presents to our modern lifestyle. Simple, memorable, and profound, Jesus' words from Matthew 4 - 6 are as relevant and challenging today as they were 2,000 years ago.", "title": "The Jesus Lifestyle", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16222492-the-jesus-lifestyle", "average": 4.45, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356498698l/16222492.jpg", "reviews": 3, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/268990.Nicky_Gumbel", "name": "Nicky Gumbel"}], "type": ["Religion", "Religion", "Religion", "Christianity", "Spirituality"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16222492-the-jesus-lifestyle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23829697-the-jesus-lifestyle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/481225.Questions_of_Life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/758950.Searching_Issues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2279669.A_Life_Worth_Living", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/110791.Alpha_Course_Manual", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1470605.Why_Jesus_"]}
