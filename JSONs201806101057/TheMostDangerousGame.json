None of them could act their way out of a puff of smoke.2. They all starred in adaptations of Richard Connell\u2019s famous short story \u201cThe Most Dangerous Game.\u201d3. They are all very happy NOT to be Jan Michael Vincent.\n4. All of the above.Yes, it was an easy, soft ball of a question; the correct answer is 4. **Removing the last vestiges of doubt regarding my nerdness, the alien is \"Tosk\" from the Star Trek DS9 episode, \u201cCaptive Pursuit.\u201dUNNECESSARY PLOT SUMMARY:Given the number of movies and TV shows that have adapted the plot of this story, I feel dumb even summarizing it. Therefore, I will be brief, like Kim Kardashian's marriage. Big game hunting expert and luminary, Sanger Rainsford, falls off his yacht in the Caribbean and winds up on the island of Dr. Moreau General Zaroff and his towering, gigantinormous Cossack servant Ivan. General Zaroff, a fellow hunter and admirer of Rainsford has grown bored with the ease of murdering even the most dangerous of big game. Removing his moral compass and setting it behind the glass of rationalization never to be touched again, the General has cured his malaise by tracking and hunting soylent green people. Next target\u2026.Rainsford. THOUGHTS:Intelligent, well-written and a lot of fun. General Zaroff is a wonderful nemesis and Connell\u2019s development of him at the beginning of the story was impressive. He could have been content to portray Zaroff as a one-dimensional, cardboard sociopath, but Connell gives the general depth and a backstory. This does not excuse or provide a basis for acceptance of Zaroff\u2019s actions, but it does make him relatable and thus far more sinister. He is cold, detached and brutal but he is also well educated, polite and a rugged class of gentlemen who has, if not a sense of honor, at least a sense of good sportsmanship. All of this simply makes Zaroff appear more diabolical. Rainsford for his part is tough, clever and competent and provides a suitable counter-point to Zaroff in the tale. Rainsford navigates the plot effectively and makes reasoned decisions without inducing pangs of \u201cdon\u2019t do that idiot\u201d from the reader. He is a more than worthy adversary for the General.Oh, and I loved the ending of the story. I thought it was appropriate and subtle and perfectly in keeping with the tone of the story. To put a line at the bottom of this review, this is a classic short story that merits the title and is one that I would politely impel people to peruse if they have not done so. Being acquainted with the plot didn\u2019t hamper my delectation of the story and I don\u2019t believe it will impede yours.4.0 stars.

One of the men loses his footing and falls overboard while on a moonlit stroll around the deck. What happened to him is for you to find out. I don't do spoilers!

Its reputation is well deserved, as Connell grabs the reader instantly and spins a tale that while exciting, has broader implications than a simple adventure tale. It is probably most famous today due to the film starring Joel McCrea and Fay Wray, which was shot around the same time as King Kong and used many of the same sets. The short story, while not having the feminine character or her brother, is equally atmospheric, and terribly exciting.Big Game hunter and writer Sanger Rainsford and his friend Whitney are aboard a yacht somewhere in the Caribbean, on their way to Brazil to hunt jaguars. There is talk of a nervous crew as they pass Ship-Trap Island, a mysterious place the sailors dread. The talk of Rainsford and Whitney turns to the hunt, and it is this conversation between the two men about what the jaguar does or does not feel while being stalked that lies at the heart of this tale.Shots are fired, and in an effort to discover what is happening on deck, Sanger falls overboard, making a harrowing escape to said island. There he discovers not madness, but the ultimate extension of himself. The \u201chunt\u201d which eventually ensues is tremendously exciting, the brevity of the story creating great movement in the narrative.Sanger, General Zaroff, and his towering right-hand man, Ivan, are memorable in this thrilling tale of adventure which also ponders larger questions. Connell was perhaps most successful at the short story, a slew of them published in The Saturday Evening Post and Collier\u2019s. But he was also a journalist and screenwriter. Though Robert Riskin wrote the screenplay for Frank Capra\u2019s wonderful film, Meet John Doe, the original film treatment was written by Connell and Robert Presell, who received an Academy Award nomination for it.Despite its age, this tale feels timeless, and is near perfect. On the technical side, there are a few typos in the transfer to Kindle, but rare, so not too distracting. A thrilling story everyone who loves the short story form should read. Marvelous stuff."}, {"userName": "Nataliya", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya", "userReview": "My favorite part of this 1924 story was a brief but satisfying cameo appearance by BORSCH, as in \"the rich, red soup with whipped cream so dear to Russian palates\". Excuse me for a second while I salivate.\n\"Great sport, hunting.\"\"The best sport in the world,\" agreed Rainsford.\"For the hunter,\" amended Whitney. \"Not for the jaguar.\"\n Rainsford is a hunter who (very conveniently for the plot purposes of this very compact story) utters statements such as, \n\"The world is made up of two classes\u2014the hunters and the huntees. Luckily, you and I are hunters.\"\n Just a few pages later, having fallen off his yacht, he comes across a depraved Russian emigree General Zaroff. The two man share a common passion - hunting. What they don't share is the idea that Rainsford should become prey in Zaroff's boredom-induced hunting game on a secluded tropical island. Rainsford, as you can imagine, is not too thrilled. \n\"Life is for the strong, to be lived by the strong, and, if needs be, taken by the strong. The weak of the world were put here to give the strong pleasure. I am strong. Why should I not use my gift? If I wish to hunt, why should I not?\"\n The strength of the story is the antagonist. General Zaroff is a perfect villain - gentlemanly calm, brutal, sociopatically-pleasant, competent, and rather sinister in his almost-supernatural hunter skill. His attitude towards his cat-and-mouse hunting game with his prisoners is effectively chilling. This story of murder/hunt for entertainment sake may have inspired The Running Man, Battle Royale or The Hunger Games. It aged well despite being almost 90 years old (spiffy Grandpa!). The story is well-written, quick and short (only 48 pages) and has a non-contrived logical and satisfying (even if predictable) ending. \nHe had never slept in a better bed, Rainsford decided."}, {"userName": "Alex \u2623 Deranged KittyCat \u2623", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13555222-alex-deranged-kittycat", "userReview": "You can listen to this story on YouTube.I've seen many film adaptations of The Most Dangerous Game, but I've never read it until now.

Since becoming familiar with the killings the Zodiac executed, as well as the possible ones he may have committed, I wanted to reread this short story. Zodiac pretty much copies all of Zaroff's obsession with hunting humans. It's quite fascinating to read such an old short story that has hints of the psychological stamping that most serial killers have: a hatred of others (he is the same race and background as Ivan and undermines his intelligence), feeling superiority, the need to dominate. It's a very interesting story, but it sets me on edge and I feel dirty reading it. Sometimes it's too much to be close to those who have no caring for human life. I do still enjoy the story and highly recommend it. Connell captures a lot within a few pages and sets up a remarkable story. Even more interesting is the implication of killers. Are men of war serial killers? Does killing someone who is hunting you constitute as murder and how is that any different from an animal killing a person to save itself from death? Is survival of the fittest a real concept when it comes to free will or does it kick in when we are on the brink of death? These are interesting questions posed by this short story and I don't know the answer to one of them. I think that's what makes this story so relevant even today.

The owner of the mansion is a hunter as well and he wants to hunt play the most dangerous game with Rainsford. I had to read this for school and was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It\u2019s a wonderful short story with vivid pictures of the island and the way the story is told is suspenseful. Even though from the very beginning my class started guessing at what was going to happen (I was hoping cannibals and a human sacrifice) and though most of us seemed to have a valid or close guess the story was still enjoyable. I feel immature for saying this but I laughed at how Rainsford ended up becoming shipwrecked. I mean me and my friends were pretty much making fun of him for about the rest of class.

That led to a discussion about a book that he remembered reading (I use that term loosely, since he is not a big reader, but more of a skimmer) back in high school. He couldn't remember the name of the book, but he swore it had something to do with games (he even suggested The Hunger Games at one point - lol) and there was a picture on the inside that had a scope and a deer. It was bothering him so much that he couldn't figure out what the name of the book was, so I googled \"book where man hunts people\" and found this, and to my excitement, I was able to download and read it for free. This was written way back in 1924 and the topic of humans hunting humans (which I wonder if it was any inspiration for Suzanne Collins) is one that has been brought up in many different books, movies, and tv shows, so the storyline was obviously predictable. Even so, it was extremely eerie because of the man hunting. He was such a calm, calculating individual which makes his hunting human sport that much more creepy. The setting, the characters, the writing, and the subtlety of the ending is one that more authors might want to look in to. I enjoyed reading this because it reminded me yet again how so many authors choose to declare their readers too stupid to figure out what is going on and spell every little detail out instead of hinting at it and letting the readers figure it out on their own.

I bet this story was a delight in 1924.The Most Dangerous Game is certainly worthy of its distinction of being an outstanding short story. It tackles timeless themes. General Zaroff is a colorful villain countered by a solid protagonist, and the plot is interesting. There is really not much more you can ask for in less than 50 pages."}], "description": "The Most Dangerous Game features a big-game hunter from New York who becomes shipwrecked on an isolated island in the Caribbean and is hunted by a Russian aristocrat.", "title": "The Most Dangerous Game", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157076.The_Most_Dangerous_Game", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386885674l/157076.jpg", "reviews": 1164, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/90864.Richard_Connell", "name": "Richard Connell"}], "type": ["Classics", "Short Stories", "Fiction", "Horror", "Academic"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157076.The_Most_Dangerous_Game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25880935-the-most-dangerous-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31743884-the-most-dangerous-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30059258-the-most-dangerous-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/249184.The_Most_Dangerous_Game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22940668-the-most-dangerous-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18307281-the-most-dangerous-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10899958-the-most-dangerous-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157079.The_Most_Dangerous_Game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157075.The_Most_Dangerous_Game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5978278-the-most-dangerous-game-and-other-stories-of-adventure", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20959240-the-most-dangerous-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8282266-the-sin-of-monsieur-pettipon-and-other-humorous-tales", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35876450-delitto-in-mare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16040852-what-ho", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
