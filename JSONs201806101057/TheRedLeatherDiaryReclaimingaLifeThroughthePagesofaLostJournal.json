The superintendent of her brownstone has decided once and for all to move years of forgotten items to the dumpster. Of these items is a red leather diary inside of a trunk that Lily rescues. The diary's author is a nonagenarian named Florence Howitt nee Wolfson. I find the 14-19 year old Florence to be a sophisticated woman for her time. Not only did she receive a bachelors from Hunter College and a masters from Barnard during the depression, she also became a successful artist and writer. Most women of the age if they attended college at all were happy to receive their Mrs degree. Additionally, Florence was well versed in all the art forms of the day and at 91 can still quote the masters of her youth. Also she was accomplished in tennis and horseback riding, which were not viewed as feminine pastimes 80 years ago. Florence looking back says that after marriage she lead an ordinary life in the Connecticut suburbs. Reading about young Florence her life and relationships seems anything but normal. She might not have accomplished all she set out at 14, but she seems to have lived a full life. As she and Lily both say, the diary is her gift. The one drawback I have noticed from other reviews is that the prose jumps from Lily's voice to Florence's. I don't find that to be choppy; after all this is a diary. If anything, Lily's commentary keeps us rooted in the present in an otherwise window to the past. I would recommend this book. It offers us a glimpse into 1930s America. Usually this era is viewed as the gloomy depression. We are not given snapshots of people who managed to achieve despite the bleakness of the decade. Red Leather Diary manages to do that by giving us a life just beginning with little mention of the despair that most have heard about many times. Thank you Florence for sharing your diary and Lily for putting it in book form. A light and charming read, I rate this memoir 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/645979-amanda", "userReview": "At the end of chapter 13:So far this book is an inspiration of living life to its fullest. Not because this teenager is necessarily more wonderful than any other human being whose footsteps have fallen on this earth; but because you can read it and look at it from afar, and touch its edges of life lived; as if it's in a snow globe or behind a fog of time. You read and you know that there is a 90 year old woman sitting beside you, fingers outstretched, touching the same edge as you are, stirring her own past inside herself. She says she lives more fully and passionately at 90 because of this reflection of self; of the past, the present, and the future swimming together, holding hands, hearts beating in unison. 90 year old Florence will tell you that there is no separate Me Yesterday, Me Today, Me Tomorrow. There is only ME.The comments I wrote in the Chicks on Lit book club discussion after finishing the book in its entirety:As I come away from the book with some time to reflect, I find I have some overwhelming thoughts... Everything we read affects us differently depending on where we are in our lives. I am in a transition. Mourning the loss of a future I'll never have, swimming upstream through the nagging desire to make my future my own, and finally, being immobilized by the realization that decisions are terribly difficult with no black or white answers. Florence, of course, affected me becuase she was in a transition, too (what teenager isn't). I don't think she would have married if she weren't pressured to do so, though I believe that she did love Nat. (Oh, what is love anyway? Now that's a topic for another thread...) Flo wouldn't have done a damn thing to change her life if it weren't by force--the force of her parents, the force of the war, the force of simple adulthood. And as she looked back, a 90 year old woman reflecting upon her youth, she oozed a sense of loss with her words. She said (I'm paraphrasing), \"Yes I had a good life, but never the life I'd imagined.\" At the end, I found myself questioning whether it's ok to live a life never imagined. Can we feel satisfied, looking back from 90 years old, if our lives veered left, right, over, under? I think not. If we want satisfaction, we must embrace the unexpected, lay aside all plans, and swing as freely on our tethers as the wind allows--only then may our aged selves sink into peace. I look to Lily Koppel as well. The image of her, standing in a pink flapper dress, the fusion of teenage Flo, crone Flo, and Lily herself beating as one heart inside one body. Lily is us. She is all of us. A woman affected by an anonymous life scribbled on diary pages. A woman in the midst of her own soul's path to peace. Is she sitting at her desk, as I am, staring up at ceiling tiles? Are you? And you and you? Are we women, as one, marching towards our future in the shadow of the adult Florence, aching to make our lives our own? I hope so. I hope we are moving forward, by inch and mile, hand in hand together, ready to take what comes. I hope for myself, that the day when I come into my crone self, I can look back and say, \"Yes I had a good life, but never the life I'd imagined... And I loved every breath!\""}, {"userName": "Janelle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1236653-janelle", "userReview": "At first I thought it was the fact that I couldn't relate to Florence's life growing up that caused me to not like the book. It's not that we grew up 60 years apart, that caused me to unrelate, it was her upper middle class, lower upper class upbringing, her lesbian trysts, her quest for love to complete her, that I couldn't relate too. It all seemed unrealistic. But then I realized I've read other recounts of people's lives that I was unable to relate to, and enjoyed them. After some thought I realized that it was the writing that drove me to dislike this book. Up until the Chapter on Nat Howitt, I couldn't really follow the story, it was very disjointed and lacked fluidity. I constantly found myself trying to figure out how old she was when such and such was happening. It seemed just random bits carelessly strung together. And, the author just seemed pompus (maybe it was her picture). Great conceptn, poor execution.

It had originally been given to Florence Wolfson for her 14th birthday \u2013 Aug 11, 1929, and Florence dutifully wrote in it every day for the five years allowed on its pages. The diary gave an intimate look at the life of a relatively privileged young lady in New York from 1919 to 1934. Florence attended the theater, opera, music concerts, had crushes and \u201clove affairs,\u201d read voraciously, studied hard, and was a keen observer of what was going on around her. But the diary did more than offer a fascinating glimpse into the past.As Lily read the young Florence\u2019s record of her hopes, dreams, experiences, heartbreaks and triumphs, she discovered something about herself.

That being said, it was not great by any stretch. It was almost as if the author just described and described things, but nothing ever actually happened. And the things that did happen weren't really stories, just descriptions. The concept was very neat, although I wish that more images from the diary had been used (i.e. her hand-written words/story). The format is where the author (Lily Koppel) would give an excerpt from the diary and then follow it with a long description that sometimes wasn't that interesting. Maybe it is just a hard thing to do, to make someone's un-connected thoughts and musings into a whole book. I think it would have been better in first person also.

Her teenage life in the 1930s was leaps and bounds more adventurous than my experiences in the 1980s. Florence sometimes comes off as a little vain and self-absorbed, but, hey, it's a diary: it's  supposed  to be self-absorbed. And in the midsts of her preening, Florence is also soaking in the arts, thinking and creating. She takes some gutsy chances and reminds me of my grandmother.

What a disappointment. This book, like \"Triangle,\" had so much promise and just failed to deliver. The premise, that a diary was found in a modern day dumpster, chronicling the life of a young girl coming of age in the late 1920s/early 30s in New York, was excellent. Unfortunately, author Lily Koppel's writing was just lame. Unimaginative and choppy, she types in Florence's journal entries, but nothing more. She just never creates a world or character to captivate the reader. The only reason I stuck with this one was because it was for my next book club. One part I did enjoy was the early description of the contents of the steamer trunks that were in the dumpster where the discarded diary was found--Lucite handbag, Grace Kelly evening bag, the flapper dress, etc. I had just been going through a box full of vintage hats and gloves for a display case, so this part resonated. One interesting thing I noticed about the vintage evening gloves--women's hands used to be much smaller! My hands are pretty small and I could not even squeeze into most of the gloves.The lack of compelling descriptive writing also disturbed me. When Lily meets a private detective near the end of the book, she doesn't even bother to describe his appearance. I guess the photo is supposed to satisfy us. I found so many such instances where there were gaping holes. Florence ends up married but we are never told the details, which actually might have been interesting.Florence, a young Jewish girl, travels to Europe before WWII. She is befriended by two Germans who tell her she's the perfect Aryan woman. She hides her Jewishness. She hangs out with people who protest America's involvement in the war. Koppel never bothers to ask her how she felt about this later in her life. She does, however, spend a lot of time describing Florence's outfits and romantic liaisons.I think part of the problem is that Koppel identifies so closely with her subject. She takes obvious pride in being told that she and Florence look alike and that Florence was considered a beauty. Koppel loves to relate how fabulous her legs are and write about her glorious red hair. Maybe if she hadn't become so enamored with Florence (she feels like her granddaughter), she would have asked some deeper questions, interviewed Florence's brother, Irving, and talked to her about whether she regretted leading such a selfish life when she was so privileged. Recently, I was talking with someone who was young during the Great Depression and she said that nobody could afford to do anything back then. According to her, everybody was affected. While Florence touches on the Wall Street Crash and her father losing everything, it didn't seem to slow her down. Her main regret seems to be the loss of her snakeskin coat in a fire when her childhood home burned down. I'm currently reading Katharine Graham's autobiography and the difference between these women is just night and day. Graham can actually write, for one thing, and draws the reader in, making the characters come to life. Although her mother was quite narcissistic and similar in many ways to Florence, Graham gives her dimension and adds humor. The book is not merely a listing of events.The Red Leather Diary was found in a dumpster. I'd like to put my copy of the book back there."}, {"userName": "Karin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1692383-karin", "userReview": "Though non-fiction, this retelling of the life of a young woman in New York city during the 1920s-30s reads much like historical fiction. It provides a glimpse of the social world of a \"brilliant and too individual\" girl shortly after the turn of the century... which is in many ways more progressive and exciting than our \"liberated\" modern environment. The story-telling vehicle for this book is an tattered old red leather diary found by the author in a dumpster behind her New York apartment building. This lost treasure provides a magical link to the past and lends a sense of excitement and naivete to what might otherwise be a simple biography.When the author of the book incredibly finds and speaks with the author of the diary, it is touching to find that, like most of us, the dreams of her youth were not realized. Though a point of criticism for some, I found the very ordinariness of the journalist's adult life to be, not a disappointment, but the reality check provided by a life lived. In reading the other Goodreads reviews, I am struck by the fact that readers are very polarized about this book. In my opinion, the ratings reflect more on the reader than the book. Most critics feel the book is dry, the life not extraordinary enough, and miss the sense of a neatly packaged life \"message.\" If you frequently find yourself bored in anything other than an action film, then you may want to skip reading the Red Leather Diary. If, conversely, you feel you can draw on a sense of wonder upon finding a link to the past in your everyday life, if you still thrill to hear friends tell tales about their past, and if you have not become hardened and blase about romance, then there is a chance that you will be transported by this book and love the read."}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1121750-deborah", "userReview": "having read most of my book club's review of this book I had decided to give it very little time.

This is a true story and it is what happened to Lily Koppel in 2003. She made an amazing discovery, an old and cracked red leather diary complete with a broken latch. Inside, she reads the diary of Florence Wolfson, a 14 year old girl when she started the diary in 1929 after she received it as a present. She continued to write in the diary through to 1934 when she turned 19. The diary is a window into the life and mind of a young girl as she grows and matures. Florence writes brief diary entries about theater experiences, literature, shopping and fashion,friendships, family and even her own sexual explorations. Lily became fascinated with the diary and set on a path to find out as much as she could about Florence and was able to locate Florence with much perseverance and the assistance of an investigator.Ms. Koppel translated the snippets and entries from Florence's diary into a novelistic type story that turns the diary and back story into a wonderful read. I have a special fondness for books related to diaries and letters. I find that diaries and letters take you to the true inner core of a person and you can get a true picture of who they are as a reader. It may be because diaries and letters are usually meant for private inner thoughts and not for mass appeal. There is a genuineness in these types of books that I am drawn to. The Red Leather Diary definitely takes you into the private inner thoughts of Florence, sometimes a bit more than you may want to know. I found Florence to be a woman ahead of her times in many ways and I was thrilled to read that Lily found her and she was reunited with the girl of her youth from the diary. It was also interesting to read about Florence's life after the diary ended and her life now.

I could feel her passion for the subject matter and for Florence, but at the same time I felt like some thoughts went unfinished, like she was distracted or trying to add everything she got from the interviews with Florence, yet not getting enough details to complete the thought and so going on to the next bit too quickly.I did like how at the end of the book, she came full term with many of Florence's friends and let us know how their lives had played out.

I have to say, I was somewhat disappointed. The subject of the book, Florence Wolfson, is fascinating, and it's irresistable to learn about her life in 1930s NYC and to draw comparisons to one's own life at that same point, when you're young and energetic and a bundle of potential and possibilities. Florence was (is) clearly a gifted writer and thinker. In fact, I really wish she had been the one to give voice to her entire story. Lily Koppel's tale of finding the diary in an abandoned steamer trunk is fascinating, but limited in how much it can offer the reader. Or maybe it's just Koppel's description that makes it feel limited. I really felt that this story would have sprung to life and been brilliant in the hands of a better storyteller, but often, Koppel's writing style just left me flat. I found myself skimming over some material because of the style in which it was presented, not because of the content itself. Still, it was a delight to be introduced to Florence Wolfson Howitt, and to catch up with the goings-on in her life since she ended her diary."}, {"userName": "Andie", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14273148-andie", "userReview": "In 2003, Lily Koppel, a young reporter for the New York Times came upon a dumpster of old trunks outside her building on the upper West side. The building, needing storage space was throwing away unclaimed items. Intrigued, Ms. Koppel scavenged and found a coat from Bergdorf Goodman, several pieces of interesting bric-a-brac and a 5-year leather bound diary that had been kept by a young girl named Florence Wolfson from 1929 to 1934.As Koppel read the diary she became intrigued with the life of this well-to-do New York woman who grabbed life with both hands and pursued philosophy and the arts with the same enthusiasm she pursued men, dancing and nightclubs. She became determined to see if Florence was still alive, and in 2006 reunited Florence with the diary of her much-younger self. Florence, then flushed out the details of her life and the result is this book - a wonderful glimpse into bygone era an of a woman who lived life to the fullest."}, {"userName": "Veronica", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/814477-veronica", "userReview": "At first I thought that I wouldn't enjoy the story of a privileged young woman in NYC during the 1920s and 30s, but Lily Koppel did an amazing job at weaving diary entries with a lot of research to craft a whimsical story. I think that really made this story work for me is that Lily asked Florence, the author of the diary, if it was ok to move forward with the book. Obviously she said yes...but the courage and fearlessness of a 90-year-old woman allowing us a peek into her thoughts, desires and dreams as a late-teenage won me over."}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91455-renee", "userReview": "The story of a NY Times writer who finds a diary from the 1920's in an old steamer truck minutes before it is thrown in the garbage. The diary records thoughts and ambitions of 14 year old Florence Wolfson over the next five years. I had no idea that the 1920's were as sexually liberating as they were and I loved learning about NYC during that time. The author is able to find Florence (90 years old and living in Florida) and the friendship they develop is nothing less that beautiful. It is nothing more than sheer luck that the diary was found by Lily."}, {"userName": "Deirdre", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5738156-deirdre", "userReview": "I loved learning the story of this forward-thinking, glamorous woman of the 1930's, and reading selections from her diary. I'm not partial to journalistic prose in general, however--the style in which the rest of the book was written--but this is just a personal preference. The story itself was lovely, and I enjoy learning pieces of history through personal narratives."}, {"userName": "Vicky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/645057-vicky", "userReview": "I didn't really read this book all the way through.
