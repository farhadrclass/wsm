But they are also the best monster! Except for the Cloverfield monster. They are scary and they just keep coming and they symbolize modern american stupid culture AS WELL AS face-eating awesome gore. And this one is full of missteps, oh boy. Like the ancient deity from the beginning of civilization is from... Ireland? And the zombie who feels remorse, which I guess is what the story is about, but still. And the non-explanation for why the zombie who feels remorse strapped an air thing to her face before she died, although that might be answered in the third one. THE ZOMBIE WHO FEELS REMORSE is the name of my new album.Still, the ending worked, zombies tended to be characters with interior monologues, sort of, and a zombie fought a bear! A zombie fought a fuckin bear. That's why we read zombie books, not for Kafkaesque commentaries on society or, like, even Dean Koontz levels of suspense. Pssh. It is an instance of somebody getting an MFA, liking zombies, and then aiming for the lowest possible common denominator, e.g. ME. Four stars!When we found out about Monster Island, Hannah and I stomped around going MONSTAR ISLAND in growly voices for about a year, until eventually we read it. While I was reading this one I said MONSTAR NATION the same way a lot of times.

This book sets up how the \"virus\" was first found in a prison and its spread throughout the West. We see the infection through the eyes of a normal person - Bannerman Clark - and through the eyes of a thinking zombie (who has no name until the end).It was interesting to see the spread of the infection (and pretty accurate as far as I know) but I liked Monster Island better. That could be because I knew the setting of NYC much better than the Western US or it could be because there was more conflict in the first book. I didn't like the idea of sending the zombie woman to go shut down the source and the explanation of why it happened just pushed my suspension of disbelief too far. What I had the most trouble with was the timeline. The zombie woman meets Mael Mag Och (the evil peat mummy from Monster Island) as a spiritual manifestation. He is guiding her east and trying to get her to help him spread the infection. At the end, he tells her that there are only a few thinking zombies and he names the doctor in Manhattan (the major zombie character from Monster Island) as one of them. But in Monster Island, we are told that he didn't become a zombie until well into the infection after NYC was overrun and that character didn't meet Mael Mag Och until after he was separated from the African girl paramilitary group. So it would seem that the two timelines don't quite match up enough for Mael to know of the existence of both these thinking zombies. I'll be reading the third book - Monster Planet - to see if the author can create a fun zombie story like the first one. I think this novel is useful to have a better understanding of the zombies of this series but it left me a little cold."}, {"userName": "William M.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5706191-william-m", "userReview": "2 AND 1/2 STARS I decided to read this series in chronological order after buying both the first two books. The writing is not bad, in fact, it's quite good. However, once the story got going, I quickly began to hate the Nilla storyline and her ridiculous invisibility gimmick. I couldn't believe what I was reading. Yes, even in a zombie novel, suspension of disbelief can only take you so far. There were a few other problems I had with the book. In one scene, a zombie (with human teeth, remember, this isn't a vampire) bites the neck of a 7 foot black bear and kills it. Please. A zombie would be hard pressed to pull out a clump of the bear's fur much less rip open its skin. In addition, every once in a while I would find some spelling errors which shouldn't happen in a professional novel costing $13.95. Other small details that took me out of the story was when a zombie threw a bone up at a flying helicopter and actually hit it. Wouldn't it be more poetic to have the bone be thrown at it and miss? The intention would still remain, but the reality wouldn't be flushed down the toilet. But okay, maybe that's being too picky. Anyway, I did enjoy Clark and Vikram's storyline and that was probably what kept me reading. Unfortunately, the ending wasn't satisfying, feeling rushed and thrown together without too much thought. I hear better things from critics about Monster Island, and being from New York City, I'm a little more excited now to read it."}, {"userName": "Stacie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/162303-stacie", "userReview": "This is the second book in Wellington's trilogy, but functions more as a prequel to Monster Island. This is about the origin of the zombies - sounds good, huh? And Wellington really pulls through with the amounts of gore and violenece you would expect from an initial infection.The problem comes in with the super-powers he starts giving some of the zombies. Invisibility, mind reading, healing, etc. Also, the mystical 'Source' of the infection - just give me a good old-fashioned government developed virus, or even a mysterious plague.Plus, i expect that the reader is supposed to empathize with the main character Nilla - who happens to be a zombie. I'll pity zombies,but I draw the line at getting to know them as separate 'special' individuals. Overall, I think I am too much of a classicist when it comes to zombies to truly enjoy this installment in the trilogy. Wellington isn't a bad author.

Wellington has a creative writing MFA and all that cute stuff, and the dude can twirl a sentence. His taut, powerful prose and lucid pacing suggests he's probably capable of writing any kind of prize-winning literary fiction he wants, but is for whatever reason fixated on zombies, werewolves, and other monsters that populate his books.Monster Nation is a prequel to Island. Where Island dropped us right in the middle of the apocalypse (\"after the fall\" if you will) and just took off running, Nation moves much more slowly, wading its way through the zombie uprising itself. In describing such events, and the slow decline of humanity in the face of a flesh-eating undead plague, Wellington falters a bit. Obviously, zombie uprisings and the subsequent apocalypses are no longer new literary territory, and the reason Island was so good was because Wellington pumped such an amazing amount of fresh life into the genre (zombie pigeons? oh yeah you better believe it.) But in Nation, he fails to achieve a similar feat. His blazing, adventurous creativity is gone, replaced by a careful attention to character, primarily in the forms of a military leader, Bannerman Clark (a stupid name), and a young woman who, through an odd series of events, kept her brain alive while succumbing to the zombie plague, thereby turning into the rare flesh-eating corpse capable of rational thought.Wellington used this same rational zombie device in Island, and it was fascinating because the character, \"Gary,\" intentionally did it to himself and proceeded to use his combination of undead invincibility and working human brain to wreak major havoc. But the thinking zombie in Nation, \"Nilla\" (again with the silly name) became who she is by accident, and the explanation of her transformation is pretty feeble (something about an oxygen bar... yeah.) Her character never really recovers from this plot twist, remaining similarly passive and poorly formed throughout the book. Wellington seems more interested in putting his energy towards his military leader, Clark, who struggles to fend of the growing zombie hordes while grappling with his own moral dilemma regarding the slaying of undead \"civilians.\" It's a nice element, but isn't intriguing enough to deserve the intense scrutiny Wellington devotes to it. I read this book aloud to my girlfriend each night, and both of us had trouble staying awake as page after page unfurled about Bannerman Clark and his soldiers shooting zombies and flying around the country feeling bad about shooting zombies. Wellington's focus on the military side feels informed and, as always, is well written, but the story itself doesn't add anything new to the problem: Ultimately it comes down to guys in uniform killin' zombies, and we've seen that before.Wellington rallies in the final 50 pages or so, culminating this second book in what is apparently a zombie trilogy with a truly unexpected plot twist that handily tied up a lot of loose ends and reminded me why I like the guy and why I will definitely read the final book in this series, Zombie Planet. Even when Wellington is slightly off his game, he's weirder, darker, and slightly better than most other horror writers I can think of."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3335783-danielle", "userReview": "Didn't love it. Didn't hate it. Still an interesting read. And shorter than what I'm used to. Part of me wishes that i read this one first, just because it really is the beginning even though it was the second book in the series. If you read them back to back anyway you'll probably be fine. I read the first one closing in on a year ago now and spent some time wondering if I had also seen some of the characters in the other book. On a funny side note did any one else notice tha the two guys we get a viewpoint from are named Dick and Clark? Dick Clark? Lol. Anyway, there were some wording issues that his spellcheck missed because they were still words and there was a time he said something about why there was a pile of zombies and there must have been food underneath and the character was wondering if the person WAS or HAD been alive and all I could think was that they are both past tense words. But overall these are minor issues and don't really affect the flow of the book. I did question the bear senario in the story. Did it escape from a near by zoo? We will never know. Wellington briefly brought in an annoying character called Agent Dunnstreet. She called her self an imaginer. Really. That's what she does. Apparently she's the only one who has ever thought about a war on the US soil and even though her plan has nothing to do with zombies, it's the only idea. Obvioulsy they would have been better off buying some fantasy/horror books like this one to at least give them a starting point. When done right, authors are the imaginers. In any case it was neat to see a version of how the government would handle such an event and how people react. The characters are well thought out. There was even a guy with an obsession with yellow peeps. Random!\"We can do good in this world or we can be miserable over the bad that is already done.

Part of me feels like the novel tried too hard to differentiate itself from other zombie novels, when there's really no need. Everyone knows about zombies and what to expect, that is not the fun in reading about them. The thrill of zombie literature is the post-apocalyptic backdrop the reader finds themselves in. Part of me feels like he went a little Twilight here (a la sparkling vampire) and tried to put that onto the zombies.The action was touch and go and the book seemed to drag on some parts...too much explanation. Their zombies, they don't need to be explained, they just are. The moment you try to explain them rationally you loose a little the moment you put a sci-fi twist you loose a lot! There are two other books to this series (Monster Island and Monster Planet) I am willing to give them a try, if nothing else then to complete what I've started. Perhaps reading the whole trilogy will help me come to a better conclusion on the novel.I didn't really care about any of the characters and they seemed to serve as nothing more than ways to fill in story holes or just to take up pace. The one thing I did find cool was the zombie like animals in the book, that was new and it worked (sort of). The main character who is zombie, but retains some human traits was too flat and just meandered around from one location to the next yet somehow she held the key to the whole thing. The sci-fi stuff was just thrown in to be different therefore held no bearing for me.Again, not bad just not great. I would rather read World War Z again or a zombie anthology.

This is the 2nd installment in a trilogy, the first being Monster Island, the last being Monster Planet. I'm going with a solid 3 star rating on this one and here's why.Although I did enjoy this book, it took some time to follow the writing for me. Now, at first I thought, maybe it's me. Maybe I'm just a slow reader that has a hard time grasping what people are saying, but then I though, no, it's only with these books that I've really felt this way. So, here's my deduction - Mr. Wellington has a unique writing style. He jumps around in his books, or at least, he has in both Monster Island and Monster Nation, now.Monster Nation begins with a news bulletin, each chapter does. Something such as, \"Last night many cases of blah blah blah were reported and officials neither confirm nor deny blah blah blah...\" or it might be a facebook-type post, \"So Earl was acting so funny last night, talking about eating brains, I hope he wasn't serious...#donteatmeearl...\" Which I enjoyed. It was different and gave a fun way to follow the timeline of the outbreak and effect across the nation (each post/bulletin was dated as well).Anyway, the book begins with a woman who wakes up not knowing who she is or where she is. All she knows is that there a lot of blood and she has this terrible wound on her neck. Next chapter we are taken somewhere else, far from the first woman to meet another character and another situation. Next chapter something else, then next chapter back to the first woman and so on and so on. This is the aspect I felt was hard to swallow. The first book in this series actually followed a similar outline for jumping around, but I felt in this case is was a bit faster paced and therefore just more difficult for a reader to connect with a character, then switch that off to connect with someone else.After a ways in, maybe 25% or so, I started having an easier time and decided to continue on with my reading of Monster Nation, especially since I already read the first book, I have an issue with needing to finish things...I did find many aspects of this story interesting and at times found myself dying to know what would happen next. Another part I found I liked about this book was that due to the jumping from POV to POV I got a lot of perspective from very different minded people, one in this story being one of the undead. It wasn't you typical undead person either, they weren't just thinking, \"braiiiinssss...uughhh...\" (and yes this undead specimen was special, and could think..among other things as well) they were struggling with the idea that they were in fact undead, and should they be evil and kill or were they truly just a good person and should they be 'good'? It was original to say the least.You pick up a lot of information in this story too. You do continue with some of the connections to characters formed in the first book, but many are new. You get a better idea of what/who is causing this 'outbreak' of zombie-ism and, although I would say the story definitely does have an ending, it is a bit of a cliff hanger, transitioning into the next and final installment. Now giving this 3 stars may turn people off, thinking it's not a very good book and whatnot, but I'll at least say this, although this hasn't been my favorite series, I enjoyed it enough that before I was finished with Monster Nation, I went and ordered a copy of the final book, Monster Planet for my Nook HD. (BUYER BEWARE - I ordered Monster Planet over 3 months ago in the ebook form for Nook HD and the formatting is all wrong, it is un-readable in NOOK ebook format and finally Barnes and Nobles refunded me. Just FYI for anyone wanting to purchase this!)So in closing this was a solid second book in this series. It follows with the same writing style and has many 'unique twists' to the zombies-come-eat-people usual story. Mr. Wellington adds in historical (not real history) backgrounds, magic, mind-reading, mummies, and more. So it makes for an entertaining read - my main issue was the style of writing and the difficulty in the beginning to catch on and get hooked. If you've already read Monster Island, I'd say go ahead and pick this up, but if you haven't...maybe try a few more highly recommend books in this genre before adding this to your currently reading lists!"}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "I read Monster Island and this is a good side by side story along with that. It is a flashback to the beginning of things, providing a clearer idea of why the undead have started walking and a little more detail on our ancient scottish undead chap that was in the first novel. Unlike the first book, this one really cannot stand on its own as I am sure the series of events will be completed in Monster Planet, the third and final (I assume) installment in this series. Mr. Wellington does a good job of creating a realm where the supernatural is the cause of the dead rising as opposed to a virus or a more scientific reasoning. We are slowly given an idea of how this threat developed and where it came from. Even thought it came from human actions, ancient gods are behind the desire to see the human race wiped clean off the planets surface. This book is even more focused on a specific undead character than Zombie Island-Nilla, who chose her own name after becoming undead because she cannot remember her name, nor anything of her own past before being bitten by a zombie herself and dying. She continued to take in oxygen while dying and thus her brain did not deteriorate. The story pretty much follows her storyline as well as Clark Bannerman, a Captain with the National Guard who is forced to become the lead in the military battle against the undead in the western states. He pursues Nilla after realizing that she is the only undead person that can still speak. He knows that she is a key to resolving this issue, even though he does not know why. Overall, the story flows quite well and is definitely entertaining. I liked how the author put a small blurb on nearly every page that blasts out a news report/personal commentary that interupts the ongoing story with information on what is occuring to people all over the country. Pleas for help, reports of mysterious killings, etc. I feel the author did a better job of explaining the undead relationship with animals-how they become undead, etc. than in the first book. It seemed then that it was just a minor point. It is not fleshed out completely here, but seems much more natural as a part of the story. Given that this series of books takes a supernatural slant, I am much more accepting of the ancient scottish zombie here than I was in the first book. I was a little taken aback by Nilla's \"special ability\" which seems out of place and makes little to no sense-how does she have that particular talent and why? Perhaps it will be further explained in the final book. Overall, the details of this book made the me understand the first book even more and appreciate it better now that things seem to be coming together more clearly. I look forward to reading the third book and seeing everything resolved (or at least resolved...for now)."}, {"userName": "C.V.

Monster Nation takes us back to the first days of the pending doom, and again David Wellington does not disappoint. In book one we are shown the methodical and strategic planning of the dead versus the living. In book two we are shown the down and dirty siege of the dead onto the living. We find the heart of every zombie story within Monster Nation\u2019s pages: chaos and destruction.Government officials, police barricades, CDC, FEMA, and the fear of civilians will not stop the infection. In the wee hours of the epidemic, officials scramble to piece together what is happening. Much like Monster Island, the author gives us the story from several perspectives. I found Nilla\u2019s story to be the most interesting. Just like Gary in the first book, Nilla has woken up dead. Where Gary had planned his death, Nilla\u2019s was a mistake, and because of her unplanned voyage, she cannot remember her real name. She calls herself Nilla because it was the only thing she could think of when asked her name. Much like Gary, Nilla finds out quickly that she has an ability that most of the dead don\u2019t. She is not driven by her hunger, but by a vision, the same one that Gary had, telling her to head east. None of that matters though, because when you\u2019re dead, the living hate you regardless:(FROM THE BOOK)They knew. The people of Lost Hills knew what she was. They could sense it. If she closed her eyes she could see them all, their golden auras, and she knew they were all looking back and seeing her darkness. Surely not as vividly, certainly not as consciously but they could sense her energy just like she could sense theirs. Clark Bannerman is a captain. His troops stumble across Nilla in the early stages of the outbreak, but she slips away. His objective is to find her at all cost. Clark knows what she can do, and he also knows that she might have the answers to cannibalistic epidemic. If only he could only see past the fact that the cannibals are not alive.David Wellington\u2019s interpretation of zombies is unique in the sense that it\u2019s not humans that the dead seek out, but the life force within them. If the dead are so inclined, and short on food, the will eat tree bark because it is living. It is the essence of life that they truly crave. Ultimately Clark and Nilla\u2019s paths have crossed for the same reasons: to find the source that is causing the dead to rise. The author keeps the pages action packed, and has a great style of writing that keeps me from putting his books down.

Perhaps it\u2019s simply symptomatic of the glut of \u2018zombie apocalypse\u2019 stories shambling across the shelves that led to my malaise or perhaps I simply let too much time lapse between reading the first installment of this series and the second book, but this fell short of expectations.On the plus side, Monster Nation describes the beginning of the undead plague, and though it\u2019s heavily tread ground within the genre, Wellington keeps the story of the struggle between military and monster horde quite compelling. However, the book also focuses on the story of Nilla, one of a few intelligent zombies, who appears to be some sort of supernatural key to the whole affair. Nilla -- as the reluctant protagonist \u2013 never really exerts much control over the plot -- things just seemed to happen to her -- and the angle of the intelligent zombie (with supernatural powers no less) just didn't resonate with me. To be fair, Wellington offers up a better than average explanation for the zombies\u2019 intelligence \u2013 though how Nilla gets there is a bit contrived \u2013 and I found his explanation for the germination of the entire zombie epidemic original and cleverly foreshadowed. And, despite this being the middle chapter of a trilogy, Monster Nation delivers a pretty complete story while leaving the door open for a third book and a conclusion to the whole arc. But ... it took a lot of slogging along with Nilla to get to these gems.I\u2019ll probably come back for the final chapter, Monster Planet because I am interested in where this is all going, but if you are new to Wellington\u2019s work, I recommend starting with the Vampire quintet (with the much dynamic Laura Caxton as protagonist) as a much stronger tour de force."}, {"userName": "Heather Dalgarno", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5868539-heather-dalgarno", "userReview": "I am a massive fan of zombie films, and I decided to give zombie fiction a go. This book is actually the second in the zombie trilogy Wellington has written but is the only one that I've read.My overall review of this book is that it's pretty average. It's a reasonable diversion if you've not got anything else to read. It is well written, but it doesn't really offer anything new to the genre.In my opinion, a good zombie story (be that in film or book form) is not supposed to be about the zombies themselves. They are the blank slate onto which we project our fears as a society, and as individuals. They are a plot device for great horror survival stories. In this book Wellington breaks one of the big rules of zombie fiction for me - you shouldn't explain where the zombies come from. It is far scarier not to know the reason the dead are rising, and if you're writing a survivalist tale it's really not necessary. Wellington cobbles together some pseudo-science and crazy Celtic magic (in America? really?) that doesn't make much sense and is more of a distraction than anything.He has all the right ingredients here, including a sentient zombie main character which I found really interesting, but at the end of the day this just doesn't add up to be a great zombie tale. I won't be reading any of the others in this series, as from the reviews it seems I may have been lucky to read the best one of the three. I had hoped for something along the lines of The Walking Dead but in novel form, this isn't bad but it isn't up to that standard."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613919-jason", "userReview": "4 Stars.This is a great second book in a trilogy as it fills in lots of details and back story and combines them with the first book Monater Island. This really sets up the final book Monster Planet to be one hell of a ride.This book technically takes place immediately following the first, the story itself is a prequel and tells the reasons behind the undead getting up again. Gary and Dekalb are still here but this one really focuses on a new character, a young, blond, beautiful girl, albeit an undead one than self named herself Nilla.Nilla, like Gary can talk, think, move well, and many other spoiler free cool things. She strives to understand what has happened to her. She wants to find out her name and reclaim her memories. She wants to solve the mystery behind why the dead are back. Nilla, strives to find meaning in her unlife, all the while trying not be killed again.All good zombie books need at least one kick ass kill scene. Let's just say that this one pitted an undead versus a very angry grizzly bear. This one also had a seriously freaky arm-less undead that played a key role in the story.This book really worked for me and elevated my enjoyment of the first. This one cannot be read on it's own as it only makes sense if you have read Monster Island. I highly recommend these two novels. They are well written, add flare to the very full zombie genre, and are real page turners. On to the last book now, Monster Planet."}, {"userName": "Karl Drinkwater", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8058558-karl-drinkwater", "userReview": "David Wellington's 'monster' series is made up of: Monster Island, Monster Nation and Monster Planet. I had bought them on a day trip to that world of books, Haye-on-Wye. Together they make up an interesting and innovative take on the zombie apocalypse genre. If you like this kind of escapist fiction then I really recommend this trilogy, and I should add that any of the books can be read standalone, though obviously reading them all does add some extra context.Monster Nation takes place before Monster Island chronologically, and covers the initial outbreak of the zombie epidemic. Personally I find this stage of any zombie series to be the most interesting. As America is over-run with zombies and some well-drawn characters attempt to check the spread we also meet another of these 'special' zombies - ones that have kept their intelligence and also often gained a new ability. In this case a female zombie who can make herself invisible. Following her plight and her attempts to determine if she still counts as human or not provides the main spine for exploring the collapse of a society. (By the way, if you're interests have a miserable bent and you enjoy this kind of nation-collapse story, I recommend Graham Masterton's 1981 novel Famine. And if you just enjoy zombies chomping on bodies then watch Charlie Brooker's hilarious and scary zombie-filled reality TV satire Dead Set.)"}, {"userName": "Chris Peters", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18208301-chris-peters", "userReview": "This is Wellington's 2nd zombie apocalypse book, and it overlaps the first. This one actually starts a bit earlier than Monster Island, but towards the end the first one catches up. Similar to the first, there are some mechanical issues that might really get you hung up. This line was one page 3, and I couldn't get it out of my head through the whole thing: \"Then pain, intense and real, far more real than anything else in her memory, as thirty-two needles sank into her shoulder, into her skin, his teeth.\" Maybe it's just me, but that way that was put together really bothered me. The timeline between the two books doesn't quite seem to match up. When reading Monster Island, I had the impression that everything had happened months and months earlier, but those events actually take place during the end. And there is a bunch of cheesy dialog in here.Of course, I've never written a book, so who am I to complain?Also, none of that really takes away from the story. Even with all that, it's still FUN. This is a B-movie on paper, and if you know that ahead of time, you are going to enjoy it. Wellington's zombies are fundamentally different from anything else out there, and he really does a great job with this new take. As a bonus, you don't have to have read Monster Island to read this one."}, {"userName": "Chella LaNiece", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5265557-chella-laniece", "userReview": "Monster Nation is the 2nd book in David Wellington's zombie series. This time, we start out with 3 living people at the beginning of epidemic that is causing the dead to rise. First you're introduced to an unnamed, blonde, California girl, a reporter named Dick, and a 60-something national guard commander named Bannerman Clark. Clark is charged with trying to contain the outbreak before it sweeps the nation, and believes the California girl is at the epicenter. The book is written in short bits, switching between the girl, Dick and Bannerman Clark. At times the writing seems frantic, and you have to really pay attention when switching story lines every couple of pages. There are no chapters, but 4 parts. News blurbs, verbiage on signs, scrawling from bathroom stalls, emails, govt notices and medical diaries appear when the story is being told by someone else. This has a real feel that you are going through this with the characters, trying to find out information as you can.Although the story is good, once again, Wellington takes over half the book for set up. I'm told that the first 2 books are set up for the last book, Monster Planet, so hopefully that one will be a lot more action and less back stories."}, {"userName": "JoAnna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5219399-joanna", "userReview": "After finishing this book, I had a hard time deciding whether or not this book should have been the second in the series. I understand the concept of a prequel, but I feel like there wasn't much information in the the first book, Monster Island, that justified the reasoning of having the second book as a prequel. I can't decide if readers would be better off reading Monster Nation first, and then Monster Island second. However, if Wellington intended it to be read this way, then I suppose that's how it should be read. Monster Nation is the story of how the epidemic began in the United States, before it was spread worldwide. There is a set of new characters in this story, with the exception of Mael, who is also in Monster Island. This was a good read, but I found it slightly annoying that there were not chapters in the book, just four parts. It makes it a little difficult to stop reading at a certain place. I did like the inserts of news headlines, blog posts, and phone conversations that Wellington inserted in between changing the points of view between his three main characters: Nilla, Clark, and Dick. They all eventually cross paths, and ally with each other in unexpected ways."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Wardrip", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125613-jennifer-wardrip", "userReview": "First off, I didn't realize when I began reading MONSTER NATION that it's the second in a trilogy. I'll now have to go back and read MONSTER ISLAND, just because I do want to read the entire story, but MONSTER NATION can and does stand on its own. The story is basic enough: zombies are taking over the US; the career military person in charge, Bannerman Clark, wastes a lot of time refusing to believe these creatures are actually dead; there are a couple of more-intelligent-than-normal zombies trudging their way through the craziness. That's the storyline in a nutshell. The problem, for me, didn't come until the end of the book, when what had been building up to a gigantic climax through 250+ pages was resolved (or, actually, NOT resolved at all) in a page and a half. Don't ge me wrong. This book is entertaining, gross, and a verifiable zombie-lover's delight. It made we want to go back and read the first book in the series. But it's ending definitely leaves you hanging and frustrated. For those who love zombie stories, you'll appreciate the new and different approach to the genre. For those who hate abrupt endings, you'll throw the book against the wall. When all is said and done, though, reading MONSTER NATION was time well spent."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Thomson", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5882694-jennifer-thomson", "userReview": "As a big zombie fan I was really looking forward to reading Monster Nation as I'd heard a lot of good things about David Wellington's trilogy. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The book started well enough with lots of zombie action, but then it descended into a bit of a shambles. For one thing, one of the undead had the power of invisibility. The 'infected' were also able to think and act like humans. And, this is the biggie. Despite having ready access to humans the central female character eats animals instead.'What!' My thought's exactly. Add in a man-eating sheep and this book's certainly not for the zombie officiando. It got to the point where I was skipping bits to get to the good stuff and there was some good stuff - mainly the story of Captain Bannerman Clark who's trying to hold back the undead hordes. In the end, I couldn't finish the book. The author seemed to be trying too hard to turn his book into a zombie version of The Stand and he failed. I'm now off to write the kind of book I wish this one had been. Namely one that respects the genre and that I'd want to read until the end."}, {"userName": "Terry Douglas", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10577054-terry-douglas", "userReview": "I know this is supposed to be a prequel to \"Monster Island\", but it felt really disjointed, probably because the only thing connecting the two books is a secondary character and one throw-away reference towards the end of the book. As a stand alone book, it was okay, however I'd give it a lower grade when ready it in the context of the trilogy. It is supposed to be an origin story for the epidemic that has swept the world in Monster Island, but 90% of the book is a slow build up to how the two (three?) main characters finally meet each other. The origin is very briefly touched upon and not really given much explanation other than through some very brief sidebars in between \"chapters\". The book then abruptly ends without any true resolution for several characters.Monster Island was actually a very solid story and tied up almost all of the plot points raised throughout the book. This book, however, leaves many unanswered questions, which I hope (but ultimately fear will not) are answered in the final book of the series."}], "description": "In the heart of America, in the world's most secure prison, something horrible is growing in the dark.
