I am a grammar and spelling Nazi, and I didn't find too many mistakes like you do in a lot of self-published works. The book did nothing new, so far as zombie books go, and there was no explanation of the outbreak (was it government, terrorists, a vaccine gone wrong, etc.). There were quite a few loose ends left dangling - that I won't mention here, so as not to create spoilers. Indeed, a few times, I truly wondered if the author has been sued by TWD and Zombieland? He calls his zombies \"carriers\" and \"The Walking Death\"...and there's one scene, that immediately made Tallahassee spring to mind...Still, I gave it four stars, because it was good enough for me to read in an afternoon, and because I did like most of the characters. I think, if there is a sequel, a little more exposition and better denouement are in order. Maybe clear up some \"huh, why did that happen?\""}, {"userName": "Michael Flores", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8322992-michael-flores", "userReview": "Brian J. Jarrett brings a fresh (If possible!) new look at zombies even though the story isn't about them, but rather more about the survivors. Lots of suspense and solid plot that moves quickly along. Especially for being a self-published book, this book is an excellent effort."}, {"userName": "Abigail", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6100497-abigail", "userReview": "I enjoyed it. Not the best zombie book but not even close to the worst. The character development was not as strong a it could have been on most areas and lacking with others. I had pockets and moments of being lost in the story and then it didn't get deep enough. It was two-dimensional. When a character dies I should have felt something but didn't.I'm glad it wasn't a good ole boy zombie read with whose stockpile of looted guns is bigger than yours. But It really could have been so much more. Everything was either a ,\"who give a s*\" moment or left me hanging wanting more. Predictable to a fault.But I sit her wondering should I rate it a 2 or 3 star or smack-dab in the middle and I think if it wasn't for Ed (the father) I would have rated this a sold 2. Ugh if we had 1-10 this would very a 4. So I will leave my 3. Do I recommend it? Zombie aficionados read, watch and take anything than can grab. It's worth checking out if your one. But it's not a strong recommendation. I bought it or got it free on a KDP day ..I think..who knows. I don't consider my time wasted. Like I said I thought it was OK and like it enough. I just feel it was too flat\u00a0and did not have any breath-holding moments zombie books should have. I never was caught off guard.

No real story arc, just a \"we're on the road and bad things happen\" story. The ending was anti-climatic and not that original. It started out decent, but went downhill. Lots of plot elements that got old; crying, lots of crying, walking along some highway hitting an exit, over-and-over-and-over, find some food, stay on highway, nothing will get you...Also, the writing structure was all tell, no show. Little glimmers here and there that it could have been better, but it was basically, okay."}, {"userName": "Nikky", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5086035-nikky", "userReview": "Story was good but writing was lacking. Too many repeats of the same idea over and over, lots of 'huh?' moments, and predictable plots lines. Other times the author skimmed over explanations of why someone made the choice they did.

Surrounded by the constant threat of attack, can they make it to the city before their luck runs out? And if they can, what will be waiting for them there when they arrive? Will the city be the safe haven they so desperately need, or will it be just another ruined metropolis teeming with hordes of the infected?", "title": "Into the Badlands\n      \n          (Badlands Trilogy #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12976653-into-the-badlands", "average": 3.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328668988l/12976653.jpg", "reviews": 14, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5302767.Brian_J_Jarrett", "name": "Brian J.
