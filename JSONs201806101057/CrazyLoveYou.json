I am usually a fan of the supernatural but in this particular book I felt I wanted something more solid and real. As a result I felt cheated by the ending and felt the author could have made Priss much more dangerous and scary if she had taken the character into a different direction. I did enjoy the way the author leads the reader in circles all through the book. It is hard to be sure who is insane and what is real for much of the time. So still a good book if not as good as Lisa Unger\"s others."}, {"userName": "Beth ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721785-beth", "userReview": "The first two-thirds of CRAZY LOVE YOU is a five-star book, the best kind, the kind that is unputdownable. Ian writes and illustrates graphic novels (a fancy term for \"comic books\"). As an adult, he's in better shape, but he grew up as an overweight sissy. His mother is confined to a mental hospital because of a horrible crime she committed when Ian was a child, a crime that almost involved him. For these reasons, he grows up with anger management problems and still has them even now.Priss (isn't that name a synonym for \"sissy\"?) is the child he meets in the woods behind his home. But so what, I thought. I was bored enough that I decided to quit if the story didn't redeem itself by page 50. On page 49 I caught on and realized I shouldn't have been bored. Here's what you need to know right up front so the book is as unputdownable for you as it was for me. (I reread the first 49 pages.)Priss is not what she appears to be; she is a mystery throughout this book. And then so is Ian. Is he crazy? Is he good or dangerous? Is Priss dangerous? Or is she not even real?So why, then, does this book get just an average rating? Because the last third degenerates to the supernatural and becomes just plain silly. If the entire book had been written like this last third, the rating would have been zero. It's too easy to solve mysteries by blaming them on supernatural silliness."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5143619-michael", "userReview": "Ian Paine has had a lot to deal with in his life. As an overweight child, he would be constantly bullied by kids at school and was to scared to stand up for himself. Ian's family would also fall apart after his younger sisters death. After that his mums mental health would deteriorate and his only escape would be to go into the nearby woods to spend time with his only friend, Priss. To start of there relationship was like all other children with lots of playing and fun times. That soon changed when Priss discovers the bullying that Ian has endured and goes out of her way to protect him and make the perpetrators pay.Years later and Ian is doing his best to move on after losing a fair bit of weight, becoming a successful graphic artist with his own popular line of comics and living in New York. Priss though refuses to leave and will continue to be his Achilles heel as he tries to drown his past in booze, drugs and sex. Things will seemingly go full circle when Ian meets the beautiful and sweet Megan and fall in love. Ian wants to be a better man for Megan and after proposing is the happiest he has ever been. Priss though is not happy and will do everything in her power to make Ian suffer for ever wanting to leave her.I can honestly say this books was not quite the way i thought it would be. I pictured Priss as the possessive ex who was very dangerous and although she was creepy i was not prepared for link that connected her and Ian. Nothing in the story is quite as it seems with the story going from one twist to the other at breakneck speed. The question of \"is Priss real or just a figment of Ian's imagination\" lingers over the story and one that becomes clearer as the story progresses. At it's heart though the story is about love, in all it's bizarre and twisted ways. For anyone looking for a heart pumping thriller with the odd supernatural elements, this book will be right up your ally and comes highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn", "userReview": "Ian Paine is a successful author of graphic comic novels. Life is good, he is wealthy, lives in a cool apartment in New York and has met Megan, the girl of his dreams. But life wasn't always so good for Ian. As a child he was the weird fat boy who everyone shunned and bullied. With a troubled family life and no friends, he spent a lot of time on his own, out in the woods around his home. One day he met a young girl Priss, who played with him and became his friend. She was always there when he looked for her in the woods, eventually following him to art school and New York, where she has become a beautiful, seductive woman. However, there is a dark side to Priss who leads Ian into wild behaviour, drinking and taking drugs. Whenever someone hurts Ian, something bad happens to them and Ian is beginning to believe Priss is involved. But is Priss real or a figment of Ian's imagination from his popular \"Fatboy and Priss\" graphic novels?This is a rollercoaster of a thriller, addictive and forever leading you on to discover the truth about Priss. The story is fast paced, slipping effortlessly between the real events in Ian's life to the fiction he is creating in his graphic novel. But what is real and what is imagined?

The way Unger has written Crazy Love You it gets under your skin, you just devour the pages to see whether you were correct that is pulsating from beginning to end. To me this is a slight departure from her previous work but it is a fantastic detour such a taut thriller that keeps you on edge throughout.Ian and Priss have been friends since childhood, they have always been there for each other, through the highs and lows of life nothing can seem to separate them. They have their special place in the woods outside of the small town of The Hollows but they seem to encourage each other. One thing that people agree on is that when Priss is around she is a bad influence on Ian, and bad things happen, which she does and Ian covers for her.As an adult Ian and Priss have escaped to New York, Ian is a respectable graphic novelist of the Fatboy and Priss stories, and has a cult following. Priss lives in a squat and bums around New York causing chaos wherever she goes.Ian enjoys using illegal and legal highs whenever he can but when he falls in love with Megan and starts dating her, Priss is none too pleased. Priss sets out to destroy the relationship between Ian and Megan who she wants to herself and not share with anyone. Priss has always been the centre of Ian\u2019s life and she is going to fight to remain there, she does not care how much pain others have to endure for her to remain in control of Ian\u2019s life and destiny.Throughout the book you consistently question yourself about Ian and Priss the rather blurred lines and it is a wonderful sleight of hand by Unger keeps you guessing at least all the way through and even then you have to question yourself. You really hope that there can be an accommodation for both women in Ian\u2019s life but whether that is possible depends if Ian can confront his past, so that he may face his future.The way this psychological thriller is written it will keep you riveted throughout the story, at times you will be shocked and others you can see things coming but like a rabbit in the headlights carry on reading. This really is a cracking read, a compulsive tale which has you rooting for Ian and Megan hoping that Priss can be contained. Lisa Unger draws you in gives you a great thrill ride, that leaves you breathless at the end."}, {"userName": "JudiAnne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1266107-judianne", "userReview": "Young Ian lives with his family in a small town in Upstate New York and he\u00a0is called Fatboy by his schoolmates.

I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. Wow, Lisa Unger really knows how to weave a twisted tale doesn't she? I'm still coming out of my book coma after finishing this one. Ian Paine is doing pretty well for himself. He is a graphic novelist, making an above average salary, rents a loft in New York and could have his work optioned for the big screen To put the cherry on the cake, he has met the love of his life, Megan. But, Ian has a few unresolved issues from his childhood that threaten his current state of contentment. For starters there is Priss, his childhood friend, his avenger and a prominent character in his graphic novels. The problem is Ian is growing up emotionally, finally, and Priss is none too happy to find that Ian has outgrown her, especially after all she has done for him. For Ian was that kid in school who was easily bullied. An only child, overweight, sheltered, and whose mother was mentally ill. \u201cAh gym class. Remember it? Institutionally sanctioned torture for society's misfits. God help you in America if you are not thin and fit, attractive, athletic, and coordinated, driven to win at any cost. God help you if you are broken or sad, or even just cerebral, or artistic, or just want to be left alone. You will be told in a million ways- directly, subliminally, - just how deficient you are. But nowhere will that message be delivered with more naked brutality than in a middle school gymnasium.\u201d Such was Ian's tortured life in \u201cThe Hallows\u201d while growing up. He is still man child in many ways until he meets Meagan. Meagan makes him want to be a better man, to grow up, to be the kind of guy she deserves. \u201c Love is like an anesthetic, isn't it? It dulls all the pain, pushes back your worries, quiets your inner demons. Your ten feet tall and bulletproof.\u201d But, it seems that Ian still can't pull everything together for Meagan. He still indulges in drugs and drink, and there is that every pressing problem with Priss, who is getting more and more aggressive as Ian becomes more deeply involved with Meagan. So, you think you have if figured out, then you don't, then you do, then you don't. Trust me, you won't figure it out. Flashbacks provide insight into Ian's dark and morose background, his frequent violent outburst, his relationship with his parents, details about \u201cThe Hallows\u201d, and how through the years anytime he found himself in a bind, Priss was always there to rescue him. Is Priss real? A figment of his imagination? An hallucination? The product of an unstable mind? Does the insanity run in the family? A dual personality? Just a character in his novels? I really like this book because of it's imaginative storyline and how it kept me guessing and thinking about the characters. It was pitch perfect pacing, with taut, heart stopping suspense, leading the reader to a pat conclusion, only to rank the rug out from under you time and time again. This novel is relentless. Suspenseful, atmospheric, dark, psychological, but through all the fog and haze of what is real and what isn't, there is one thing that stands out to me. Love. Yes, love. If not for that powerful emotion the conclusion of this book would have much different.  You will think about this book long after you finish it. Even as I write this review certain details are still running through my mind making me appreciate the story even more. 4.5 rounded to 5"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3680008-michael", "userReview": "Ian is a troubled man who does not have good role models to look up to.

Ian refuses to talk about her, stating their relationship is toxic, but he sees her behind Megan back. Megan is the ideal girl that everyone wants to bring home, she is sweet and trustworthy, the complete opposite of Prissy. Taking things to the next level, Megan wants to marry him and start a family. Ian does not know if that is a good idea, especially since her father is apprehensive about them taking things to the next level. Prissy thinks Ian relationship with Megan is a big joke but Ian is adamant that their relationship is solid.A fire leaves many questioning who started it? Ian is going to have to convince a lot of people of his innocence but he is not going to make Prissy a suspect.

As you read on and become involved in this drama you will start to doubt who is real \u2026art is reflecting life a little too consistently mirroring chapters in Ian\u2019s graphics books (or is it the other way round?) and this will have your head in a spin. This is a love story with delusions, hauntings, drug dependency and psychosis. This is a fast moving intense and very emotional psychological thriller \u2013 Ms Unger is at her best her as she delves into the psyche of her characters and shares with you their very dysfunctional lives that are teetering on the verge of meltdown. At the heart of this narrative are the basic human needs of being loved and wanted and listened too; we are all motivated by love and fear and this book has massive helping of each ingredient. The character Ian Paine (such an appropriate name considering Ian\u2019s lot in life) writes and illustrates graphic novels for a living. I love the way the author uses the script and literal illustrations in Ian\u2019s graphic novel, Fatboy and Priss to provide an alternative voice, an alternative reality in this novel. Trouble is we don\u2019t quite know whose voice it is and its voice becomes more real as Ian\u2019s hold on reality slips. Ms Unger exposes so many social issues in this novel; post natal/partum depression, child abuse, drug dependency, psychosis and addictions of all varieties. It is an eye opening experience reading this book, delving into worlds that blur and constantly redefine themselves. It is hard to know what reality is, which events/voices are the hallucinations and I like that this book plays with the perception of reality. Drug induced psychosis is a very real problem for so many people, especially young people and I am glad this novel highlights this issue. This is a fascinating read and one that I think is enhanced by reading Ms Unger\u2019s short story series based in the town of Hollows where Ian grew up and the dramas started.

THE WHISPERS: If you have read the other titles leading up to the main attraction with teasers, introduced in the novellas--the writer, creator, and illustrator, Ian Paine. He is now a successful graphic novelist, with a famous comic series featuring characters: Fatboy and Priss.In his popular series, Fatboy is fat, a nerd, and a loser. Priss is smoking hot, a sexy red head and a favorite among all the teenage and adolescent boys. The fans are unaware, Ian was Fatboy, and Priss was his only childhood friend and salvation. Two souls, with a tragic childhood, lost in the small town called, The Hollows outside of New York. Fatboy had a difficult childhood bullied at school his entire life. It is only when he left the town, worked out, lost weight, new clothes, apartment, new haircut, identity, did he become a successful novelists living in New York, a changed man. (with unhealthy addictions). Priss was always there for him, when no one else was. However, now that he is successful and independent, does he still need Priss? She is always there tempting him and pulling him in. Is she a real person, or just an imaginary friend he created when he was younger? Ian meets a new gal (a nanny) at the park named Megan. Megan is the nice girl, who comes from a good family, unlike his own dysfunctional one. He wants this life so bad; however, Priss continues to draw him into her world. As the relationship between Megan and Ian grows and becomes more serious, Priss is threatened, making Ian feel more insecure and pulls him back to the Hollows, a place where he never wants to find himself again. After he has worked too hard to escape the whispers, the voices, his childhood, the memories, and the negativity of this small town.With flashbacks from Ian\u2019s childhood years  to the present, we learn of more destruction. From his mom with mental illness, a dead sister, a dad which is emotionally removed, and a grandmother which used food for comfort. What about Priss, her role? Now, Megan is in danger and Ian may lose everything with self-destructive behavior, unless he confronts his past to find the real reason behind his relationship with Priss and The Hollows. What does Priss really want and is he strong enough to face the future, and have a normal relationship with Megan and a future family.As Ian\u2019s present and personal life, collides with his fantasy characters \u2013readers will be glued to the pages to learn the final fate of these two partners in crime. You will learn of the horror of Priss' childhood and why these two were bound emotionally, to one another. A fast-paced suspense psychological thriller, leaving you guessing reality versus fiction, and good versus evil. CRAZY LOVE YOU can be read as a standalone; however, would recommend reading the novellas in order to get a good ideas of the craziness of The Hollows. All are 4-5 star thrillers and Lisa Unger has some creative imagination! The Whispers  is an e-novella in three-parts, spanning 30 years in the life of Eloise Montgomery, who discovers her amazing gift in the wake of tragedy. Its tendrils reach back to FRAGILE, the novel in which Eloise first appeared, and ahead to CRAZY LOVE YOU. I listened to the audiobook,  narrated by Jeremy Bobb, with a perfectly matched voice for Ian for an outstanding performance. This is definitely one you will not want to put down.

He found solace with his friend Priss and his love of\u00a0comic books. Bullied and accused of crimes he did not commit he sought escape to\u00a0New York City. He becomes a successful graphic novelist and through it all Priss remains his friend and confidant. Priss has a whirlwind personality filled with booze, drugs and sex. She is very protective of Ian, and their relationship is quite toxic. Ian is growing weary and is ready for something more when he meets and falls for Megan. For the first time in forever, his life is falling into place perfectly, but Priss is not happy and the tale that unfolds sends their lives spiraling out of control.Unger weaved such an incredible tale from Ian\u2019s childhood to his wildly successful Fatboy graphic novels. I love how she kept me as\u00a0the reader on edge as I\u00a0tried\u00a0to discern fact and fiction. A subtle paranormal thread and side characters took me\u00a0further down the rabbit hole. Ian while not entirely likable is a character the reader comes to care for even as we question everything. Megan is sweet, and their romance is sprinkled throughout the book. The focus if Crazy Love You, is on Ian and his relationship with Priss. It was brilliantly done.The synopsis of Crazy Love You is vague, and I make it a point never to reveal more. I think that with this book in particular the joy is in the discovery. I went into this with nothing more than the synopsis and loved how Unger allowed the tale to unfold, weaving the past into the present and connecting the dots. The characters are fleshed out, the story is vivid and the tension and danger increase as the story progresses.If psychological thrillers and unreliable\u00a0narrators are your thing, Crazy Love You will knock your socks off.

I wanted him to smarten up, man up and move on. However, he's a broken spirit and his journey is a difficult one. I felt I'd figured out the riddle of Priss early on, but the author weaves in so much suspense you are happy to go along for the ride. Will Ian confront his demons? Will he be able to leave the specter of Priss behind and have a healthy life with Megan? Ms. Unger keeps the reader guessing right until the end, and even afterwards. I'm not entirely convinced Ian has vanquished his ghosts. I'm not sure he ever will. And that sense of wonderful foreboding is what makes this story shine."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12892069-laura", "userReview": "I'm having a hard time rating this book, to be honest.

I\u2019m partial to the odd psychological thriller myself. I read In the Blood last year and thought it had some clever, creepy moments. So I thought I\u2019d try her latest book, Crazy Love You to see what kind of twisted journey I could be transported on. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. While the book\u2019s plot moves at a breakneck speed, I guessed the twist early on and I kept reading, hoping to be surprised by a blind turn or a subtle piece of evidence I\u2019d missed. But it didn\u2019t happen. Not even the \u2018but it was all a dream\u2019 ending. There was no punch, no tricks, no nothing. I think I would have enjoyed this book more had I not guessed the twist, but I think there were so many hints that it\u2019s pretty hard not to work things out.Crazy Love You has a very interesting plot though. It\u2019s told from the first person perspective of Ian, a successful graphic novel artist and author living in a really cool loft in New York City. His life is pretty sweet, he\u2019s found a great girl in Megan and people love his Fatboy and Priss stories. Ian has a sad past though \u2013 his little sister died as a baby and his mother lives in a psychiatric institution in The Hollows (a familiar setting in Unger\u2019s books). Ian was also teased for his weight as a child/teenager, but he always had his friend Priss. She was his strength, but she had a nasty habit of getting him into trouble. Ian\u2019s starting to work out that Priss is a bad influence on his life, but Priss doesn\u2019t want to let their relationship end. What\u2019s great is how Ian\u2019s life is mirrored in his Fatboy and Priss novels. I loved reading how the next story would develop even more than Ian\u2019s real life, because it had that element of fantasy and positive spin to it.As for the characters, I started off sympathising with Ian. As the novel progressed, I lost my patience with him. He\u2019s essentially weak and although there are other factors at play, he\u2019s increasingly unlikeable. I didn\u2019t feel that Megan deserved him \u2013 she was a good girl, rather innocent but I wondered how their connection could stay so strong. Was it her need to save Ian, redeem him? I felt she brought much more to the relationship than he did. And as for Priss \u2013 she\u2019s a firebrand. Determined, she won\u2019t let anybody stand in her way \u2013 which is exactly what Ian needed to balance the weak parts of his personality. Even though she wreaks havoc in the story, I wish she\u2019d done something with the ending. I felt it was a bit of a cop-out, a letdown. I like thrillers to have some form of sense, rather than relying on unproven subjects to \u2018explain\u2019 why things happened that way. (I\u2019m not going to spoil the ending here).The story of Crazy Love You is good, but the ending just didn\u2019t do it for me. Other readers may not see the twist or be happy for the ending to be slightly ambiguous/implausible, but I\u2019m afraid I couldn\u2019t forgive that. I would like to read a Fatboy and Priss novel though!Thank you to Simon & Schuster for the eARC. My review is honest and unbiased.http://samstillreading.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Bookschatter", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7543172-bookschatter", "userReview": "Crazy Love You\u00a0 by Lisa Unger is an intriguing and taut \u00a0psychological suspense narrated from the point of view of Ian, a man with\u00a0a lot of baggage from his past.\u00a0I devoured each page, and although I had worked things out when I was just ten per cent into the story, this just added to my excitement and eagerness to read on.\u00a0I think that if I had just picked up this book, without having read a previous piece, I would have had a completely different take on the events being presented to me, which may have kept me guessing but may have ultimately left me confused.\u00a0Therefore, if you are considering reading this book, I would strongly suggest you first read The Whispers e-novella, which comprises of three parts: \"The Whispers\", \"The Burning Girl\" and \"The Three Sisters\". \u00a0Ensure to read them in that order.\u00a0I would recommend these novels to anyone who is comfortable with paranormal and supernatural events,\u00a0\u00a0I truly enjoy Lisa Unger's writing style and will endeavour to acquaint myself with her back catalogue.\u00a0[ARC received via Netgalley]BooksChatter"}, {"userName": "Kari", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101554-kari", "userReview": "I've had Crazy Love You on my TBR list for a while. I'm regretting waiting over a year to read the book. because really enjoyed it. The story-line ended up going in a completely different direction than I thought is was going. The main character in the story has ties with The Hollows, a small town with secrets and ghosts. Ian is a graphic novelist living in New York City. His best friend Priss is a bad seed who always gets him into trouble. His drug addition doesn't help matters. When he meets Megan, the love of his life, Priss seems to not want to let go of Ian and let him be happy.As I said, I thought this book would go in one direction, but ended up being something completely different. I won't give away too much of the plot because there are a few twists that will surprise you. I ultimately did like Ian. It was hard to watch him self destruct. But honestly, I found myself rooting for him and especially Megan.I do recommend this one. I thought it was creepy and full of suspense. I plan on looking up this author's other books involving The Hollows."}, {"userName": "Kimberli Galvez", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4851931-kimberli-galvez", "userReview": "move over Steven king... this book is mind blowing and will have you reading until late at night.

Give me a good story with a captivating plot any day of the week and you'll see me smiling while reading. Crazy love you puts all other books to shame. They can't compare to the mix of heart, suspense & horror in this compulsively addictive story. I loved everything from the characters to the flow of the story. Every character had personality and was unique in their own way. I had a clear description of each person and what they contributed to the story. Priss is what you picture a hot badass to be. She's wild, strong, fun and doesnt take crap from anyone. Theres only one problem with her. Priss is bat-sh!t crazy! She vindictive, vengeful and full of rage on Ian's behalf. Ian is sweet, corny, funny and honest. He doesn't skirt around the truth which is refreshing.Ian's mother...hell, she scares me. I think even more than Priss does. What mother just leaves her baby crying in dirty diapers to take a nap?!?! I was enraged, upset, horrified and confused all at the same time. And then just when you try to come to terms with her being a detached mother, she does the unspeakable...Megan, :) , Megan is sweet and pretty and naive like most sheltered girls. Even though she grew up around money, she didn't let it taint her, and that is a rare quality. Her love for Ian makes me smile. Its deeper than just list or affection. Its the kind of love we all dream about. Pure, and everlasting.I remember, at Page 49 was when i officially started questioning Ian's sanity. Does he have split/ dual personality disorder? Schizophrenia? I loved not knowing what was real from what was imaginary, until the climactic ending that had me on the edge of my seat. The resounding theme of 'the Hollows never let you leave' was held true even till the end, which kinda broke my heart. I wanted Ian and Megan to get their happy ending, and in a sense they did... but trapped in town of Hollows."}, {"userName": "Diane Cuipers", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55035167-diane-cuipers", "userReview": "Aan de kant gelegd flauw boek !"}, {"userName": "BookNerdsBrainDump", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25796094-booknerdsbraindump", "userReview": "Short Take: Uh\u2026 what just happened here?I think I\u2019m getting cranky in my old age. Or maybe it\u2019s that I\u2019m lazy, and I just don\u2019t like to think too hard anymore. Maybe my OCD is finally winning, and I just can\u2019t be happy unless everything is wrapped up in a nice neat package, with the corners all taped down and the loops on the bow exactly the same size.Take, for example, Crazy Love You. This was a really, really, REALLY fun book up until the end. Ian Paine\u2019s life is one big raw deal. As a child, he suffers through a terrible incident that ends with the death of his baby sister and his mother\u2019s institutionalization. His father tries to make sure he\u2019s OK, but is one of those manly types who has a hard time with emotions. A relentlessly bullied teenager, Ian turns to food and comic books for comfort. And he turns to Priss - his one and only friend, confidant, lover, avenging angel, his everything, for a very long time. Priss gets even with the bullies and unkind teachers for him. She\u2019s dark and angry, but she doesn\u2019t care how much he weighs, or how much of a social outcast he is. She\u2019s also all he has. He never questions the twisted roads she leads them both down. Eventually, as an adult, Ian begins creating his own comic series \u201cFatboy and Priss\u201d which becomes successful enough for him to move to a luxury apartment in Manhattan.Priss moves as well, and the two still see each other occasionally. But then Ian meets Megan. Megan is, quite simply, good. She\u2019s working as a nanny, and actually really cares about the little boy she watches. She\u2019s kind, and pretty in a simple way, and open - everything Priss is not. Ian falls head over heels in love with Megan, and she with him, and their lives couldn\u2019t be any more perfect but for one thing: Priss isn\u2019t happy. And when Priss isn\u2019t happy, very bad things can happen.There\u2019s a lot of meat to this one. We get flashbacks to when Ian was a lonely, furious teenager, and little drips of insight into who Priss is, interspersed with the scary and bizarre things that are happening to both Ian and Megan today. Crazy Love You shines so hard in these parts. Lisa Unger is fantastic at building these characters, and putting them in jeopardy, and making me flip pages faster and faster to get to the answers. Ian is an unreliable narrator, and we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s lying or hallucinating or telling the honest-to-God truth throughout the book. Priss is a cypher, maybe real, maybe not, maybe a delusion or a ghost or just a really mysterious person. Megan is drawn to Ian for her own reasons that don\u2019t necessarily make sense to anyone else. What\u2019s great about all of it is that the characters are so damn real. From Megan\u2019s compulsion to be a caretaker, to Ian\u2019s anger and self-loathing, you really get a feel for who these people are, and even when they are behaving in ways you don\u2019t agree with, their actions are exactly what you\u2019d expect.But none of the story clicks together in any kind of satisfying way by the end. Had the first seven-eighths of Crazy Love You not been so great, I would probably be a lot more forgiving of the ending. I've always thought that the open ending is a cop-out. \"Was it this, or was it that? WE MAY NEVER KNOW.\" Ugh. It's not thought-provoking, or mysterious, it's just ambiguous and a little lazy. It's a way to avoid having to tie up loose ends or fix inconsistencies. But then again, damn, those were some great characters, and the pace was perfect, and the steadily increasing threats and assaults made Crazy Love You impossible to put down. What the heck, I'd still recommend it for those reasons.The Nerd\u2019s Rating: FOUR HAPPY NEURONS"}, {"userName": "Tamara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7757267-tamara", "userReview": "Review originally posted:Traveling With T This book was sent to Traveling With T for review consideration.Crazy Love YouIan, when he was growing up, did not have a good life.

Priss has other ideas, though. And she\u2019s not willing to let Ian go.Traveling With T\u2019s Thoughts:Wowza. This is my 3rd Lisa Unger novel. CRAZY LOVE YOU makes you wonder at times if you are going crazy. What is real? What is in Ian\u2019s head? Is Ian an unreliable narrator?I kept going back and forth in my head about this book. Like I enjoyed it quite a bit- and I would find myself turning pages to find out what would happen next. Then it got to a point that it almost took on a much more sinister tone than I was anticipating (and I CANNOT read that kind of stuff at night before I go to sleep) so I put the book down to finish the next morning.Each time I thought I had something figured out for sure, that I knew where Lisa was headed- well, she just laughed and took the book elsewhere. By the end, my head was so twisted (but in a good way!)Ian was a character that I couldn\u2019t decide about. He would be sympathetic at times, then at times I would want to shake him so hard his teeth would fall out (please don\u2019t tell Priss I said that!) In the end, when all was revealed, I was entertained. I thought some of the last twists that Lisa threw in were nice touches.So, what is the verdict? This being the 3rd book of Lisa\u2019s that I have read- I didn\u2019t enjoy it quite as much as I did IN THE BLOOD, but way more than I did FRAGILE. I\u2019m def recommending the readers of Traveling With T to give this book a try- especially if you dig a psychological suspense book!Bottom Line: Buy. Borrow. Steal (not really!) Get this book.*This book was sent to Traveling With T for review consideration by Touchstone Books.
