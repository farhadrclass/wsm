{"ratings": 67, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Russell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2503806-russell", "userReview": "For a first novel published in the 1930s by an Australian author, Christina Stead\u2019s Seven Poor Men of Sydney is a very forward-thinking novel, though it almost never came to light at all. Initially rejected for 5 years prior to finally being picked up by publisher Peter Davies, even they didn\u2019t want to take the risk on printing it as a debut, so released Stead\u2019s book of stories The Salzburg Tales first. Most likely Stead\u2019s Modernist approach and scent of Marxist themes throughout the novel were the cause of alarm, especially in a time when Australians had always revered the social realist form over all else, and Modernism hadn\u2019t quite taken its place\u2014not really finding that place until some decades later with Patrick White, a great admirer and in later years a friend of Stead. Some may even argue that Modernism still struggles to find readers there.On the surface this, much like most of Stead\u2019s other novels from what I have seen, looks a very simple affair. The novel tells of seven working class men and one woman, all trying to make their way through the toils of life in Sydney in the 1920s. However, there is a lack of conventional plot to speak of, instead Stead chooses to concentrate and propel the novel forward through the personal and social relationships of its characters and their surroundings, where thematic patterns start to emerge and weave their way throughout each chapter. The most impressively handled and unexpected theme being that of the effects of war on the returning soldier, with the character Michael being arguably the most impressive creation as he struggles with the alienation and depression of a post-WWI Sydney. There are also a number of sections where characters will embark on long, maddened discussions about politics and social structures, the most effective of these in the conversations between the characters Joseph, a financially struggling printer, and Baruch, a jewish intellectual who is a prominent member of the local Marxist group. When these two are pontificating about the society and city that surrounds them, the pages move past very quickly, such is the way their words draw the reader in. Stead also uses techniques that remind of Virginia Woolf in many ways, where a character will look internally to evaluate their current plight in what Delia Falconer (who wrote the introduction to the latest edition of the book for Miegunyah Press) describes as \u201cmetaphysical soliloquies\u201d. These techniques never seem to settle on the one character for too long, with the shift of focus from character to character throughout, allowing the reader a better insight into the minds and motivations of all of the novels main participants. And though the plot may seem thin on the surface, it\u2019s what lies beneath and inside these people that makes this novel so remarkable.Stead also has a brilliant way of using lush, euphonious language to describe the setting of Sydney, in many ways, the true star of the novel. The reader gets a exceptional feel of the era and the city at the time, not just what it looked like, but Stead has a way of making you feel the settings, see the trees and the bay, feel the touch of the air on the skin. There\u2019s an energy that moves through her descriptions that is often missing from many other novels:\u201cThe hideous low scarred yellow horny and barren headland lies curled like a scorpion in the sliding sea and sky. At night, house-lamps and ships\u2019 lanterns burn with rousing shine, and headlights of cars swing over Fisherman\u2019s Bay, In the day, the traffic in the village crawls along the skyline, past the lighthouse and signal station, and drops by cleft and volcanic gully to the old village that has a bare footing on the edge of the bay. It was, and remains, a military and maritime settlement.\u201dThe only real downside to this fantastic debut, is that at times, in between all the beautiful descriptions of the landscape and scenery and the interesting dialogues between these endearing characters, is that with the absence of plot, the novel does tend move into lulls which can move the reader\u2019s interest through ebbs and flows. Overall though, this is a brilliant piece of work, and probably an excellent starting point for anyone wanting to read some of Stead\u2019s work (a largely ignored author in her home country) before moving into the heavier and more well-known titles like The Man Who Loved Children or For Love Alone."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (JC-S)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283014-jennifer-jc-s", "userReview": "\u2018The hideous low scarred yellow horny and barren headland lies like a scorpion in a blinding sea and sky.\u2019Set in Sydney in the 1920s, this novel constructs a portrait of seven poor men (and one woman) based on their personal and social relationships. The seven men are Joseph Baguenault, Tom Withers, Baruch Mendelssohn, Gregory Chamberlain, Michael Baguenault, Tom Winter, and Kol Blount. The woman is Catherine Baguenault, Michael\u2019s half-sister.The first two chapters of the novel are focussed on Michael, and paint a portrait of an introspective and intense young man who has rejected ties to his family (except Catherine), his church and his school. After falling in love and being rejected, Michael had enlisted in World War I, and then returns to Australia alienated and suffering from nervous disorders. Once back in Australia, Michael takes up with several of the young socialists with whom Catherine - an idealistic political activist- works. Their cousin Joseph Baguenault, a devout Catholic, is a printer, who works with Baruch Mendelssohn, a young Jewish intellectual at Gregory Chamberlain\u2019s printing press. Chamberlain is incompetent: business is bad and payments to his staff are two months in arrears. Tom Withers, also employed by Chamberlain, is plotting to take over the press. Socialism and capitalism are discussed, with each of the characters responding in accordance with their own viewpoints. But talk does not lead to improvement.\u2018A suicide at the Gap was a commonplace affair. Everyone knew why a person committed suicide: if it was a man, because he couldn\u2019t pay his bills or had no job; if a woman, because she was going to have a baby.\u2019While each of the characters is subjected to forces outside their control, it is Michael who loses his life:\u2018He takes a step nearer the edge, and at the same moment this idea splits him from head to foot: \u201cWhat if I should fall upon a rock?\u201d He falls into the sea, the wave a moment later cracks his skull against the submerged pediment of the cliff, and his brains flow out among the hungry sea-anemones and mussels.\u2019Shocked by this event, Catherine is eventually driven into an asylum, and Joseph\u2019s religious faith is shaken. None of the eight main characters was able to achieve either economic security or a satisfying life in Australia. Youthful idealism provides no escape from lives blighted by poverty. Neither capitalism nor socialism has the answers. But this isn\u2019t a novel about salvation and solutions. In part it\u2019s about conflict and relationships between characters, and about class oppression. But it\u2019s also a window into their inner lives, and a reflection of the times.\u2018I live with men who make buildings, newspapers, machines, designs for cloth. You housewives are absolutely ignorant of the world; you don\u2019t know how stories are fabricated in newspapers or in scriptures, how the house is put together, how cloth is made or dyed.\u2019I will reread this novel, not so much because of the story but because of the language used and the relationships depicted. This is one of those novels that made me stop frequently, to think about how life may have changed, or not, for the poor and the idealistic.In her introduction to this edition, Delia Falconer writes that this novel:\u2018.. is a dark love letter to Sydney, a portrait of madness, and the study of a lost generation. It is brimful of overlapping visions, realist, modernist, collective and Nietzschean.\u2019 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to recognise all of those overlapping visions in order to appreciate the story.This was Christina Stead\u2019s first novel, and the only novel set entirely in Australia. Note: My thanks to NetGalley and Melbourne University Publishing for the opportunity to read this new publication of \u2018Seven Poor Men of Sydney\u2019 which was first published in 1934.

This, her second novel, is a breath-takingly ambitious modernist masterpiece displaying a literary chutzpah that invites comparison with James Joyce's debut, 'Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'. In her introductory essay Delia Falconer claims Stead's novel is 'far more daring' as 'Portrait' depicts a single consciousness while Stead plumbs the depths of a whole cohort of personalities. The many moods of the working harbour and shabby beauty of the city mythologise Sydney in lush but precise poetic detail, all the more remarkable for the fact Stead wrote the novel while abroad. Set in late 1920s Sydney with its half-built bridge and its grinding poverty, the main arc of the story follows the fates of the half-siblings Michael and Catherine Baguenault who have grown up in a fictionalised Watsons Bay (Fisherman's Bay) and both suffer from an intensity of soulfulness bordering at times on insanity. The other six poor men of the title include their mild-mannered cousin Joseph and his fellow employees at a printing works, the ruthless, plotting Tom Withers, the intellectual Baruch Mendelssohn, and the pathetic owner Chamberlain. Michael has a feverish friendship of mutual dependency with a debilitated young man Kol Blount who half-worships Michael for his detachment from social norms while librarian Tom Winter is a no-holds-barred communist preaching revolution at this loose collection of lost souls. The milieu is one of working class and bohemian left-wing political awareness and debate set around worker's education lectures, socialist meetings and rallies and late night drunken parties. The cast also includes the north-shore dwelling Folliots, husband and wife sponsors of socialist activism, with whom Michael and Catherine each become romantically entangled. The book abounds with a youthful fervour of sensitivity to ideals and ideas, joyous at times and giddily dangerous at others, and consists of many lengthy conversations and speeches which are so heightened in use of language as to burst the bounds of realism. Even so, many of the scenes in this book are well-grounded in a grasp of the real-world politics of capitalism (I think here of the way the weak boss, Chamberlain, has his printing business stolen from him and the memorable speech by the ambitious, grasping foreman Withers as to why he will not answer the call to revolution by socialist leaders who are happy to see workers blood spilled). Yet none of this disrupts our empathy for and interest in the individual consciousness of these sharply drawn characters, each damaged and flawed in their own way. Some escape the soul-crushing prison of Sydney's poverty (Baruch sails to the USA for a political career while the Follets beat a retreat to England). Michael treads a predestined path to self-destruction while Catherine, taken for granted by the men around her, proves to be a tough survivor. The book was criticised at the time (by contemporaries such as Miles Franklin) for being too clever. And yes, it is a very challenging read at times, particularly some of the later chapters where Catherine embarks on a Joycean stream of consciousness story-telling spree. But the writing is so compellingly beautiful, complex and, at the same time, vivid and precise, I was happy to take the ride. It is certainly a book I will read again as its riches cannot all be appreciated on a first reading."}, {"userName": "Claudie Plowright", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30098490-claudie-plowright", "userReview": "i feel as if i've read enough to say that i read it, but like..."}, {"userName": "A Templeton", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62456452-a-templeton", "userReview": "Don't know why I fell into this book again but probably mostly to do with being in Sydney right now. I guess the lure of the book and its main strength is the ambience, the haunting descriptions of the built and natural city, urban poverty of the 30s, the seaside colony, etc. The actual, interpersonal plot of the book - the central characters and their conversations - really is difficult, quite boring and thinly veiled (is this what makes it 'modernist') pretexts for the author's musings, and what seem like mostly redundant dramas of the great socialist cause. There are so many gear changes where it is unclear what is at stake, or what's at stake is completely latterly reevaluted. This is what made my first reading of this book more of a skimmy dream than a close examination, pace-by-pace. Knowing the environment of the city this time around really helped. I guess I instrumentalised it as an account of why the old parts of Sydney look the way they do, and how much has changed.Towards the end the drag of the novel became more palpable, as there were these half-hearted attempts at reconciliation; vague if looping revisits to the church and the printers and the old houses in Vaucluse. There is even an attempt at nostalgia towards the end, something I was actually shocked at, given that it follows this quite schizoid series of final chapters. The narrative dissolves into parables, particularly surrounding place, and catalysed by Catherine's move to the asylum and Baruch's to the US. Michael's death is implicated as symptomatic of the problems of place, the product and prophecy of a 'haunted' Sydney. I was surprised to find this at the culmination of the novel - his death is a distinctly gothic moment, generically, and moves the narrative into a reason-motivated exposition afterwards; 'Catherine's narrative' being set up as a police report, but reading like a modernist dreamscape. This is what I mean by schizoid. It was strange to observe this return to the idea of 'land' and settler interactions with it, colonial trauma and bloodshed. But it stops short at acknowledging dispossession of Indigenous peoples, as the figures of trauma seem to be invariably convict, or else Michael/Michael's ghost. Kol Blount's speech in the final chapter is the most direct on this theme. It's strange, half-thought, or afterthought. It sits too large at the end to constitute a proper subtext. Chamberlain's bankruptcy, as the other thread in all of this, also feels half-elaborated. As one of the 7 men, it's hard to count him first as a peer, because he owns the press and employs the others, and then as a real characters. He's more of a caricature of the failed colonial entrepreneur. His daughter and wife are the same (the latter literally veiled the whole time.. all we hear is about this skin disease and that she betrays him). And as a caricature, he fails to evoke the appropriate emotional response, like joy or violence, or what? Does Montague as well, as his like more successful/more evil counterpart? I guess what I see is a crisis in the values of the novel: so the relations between some things and others, and why. I think of Catherine as the novel's keeper, 'That is my life and only a madman knows it'. Her choice to go to the asylum, but actual *lack* of insanity is perhaps a cop-out, but also a narratological cop-out."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1758411-lisa", "userReview": "As you can see from the lyrical opening lines from her first novel, Seven Poor Men of Sydney, Christina Stead had vivid memories of her favourite places in Sydney, even though she had fled Australian parochialism some years before her final revision of the novel for publication in 1934. But although she came from a middle-class background, she also had vivid memories of the deprivation she had witnessed, and the first chapter paints a poignant picture of childhood poverty with her depiction of the childhood friend of her central character, Michael Baguenault:Annie Prendergast lived with her family in part of the house. The little girl was thin, with black eyes and hair. She scratched her head and body all the time, and always smelled of ingrained dirt. In the corners of the house bats flew, swallows dropped mud and dung from every beam, and from all the cracks of the great whitewashed stones at the back ran cockroaches, beetles and rats. Cockchafer beetles, cicadas and mosquitoes shouted loudly in summer evenings in the tall trees; large spiders hung in the outhouses, and fearsome-looking, but innocent crickets and slaters dwelt under the bits of wood and sheets of corrugated iron fallen off the roof into the grass. The house attracted Michael and the other children with the same charm as a stagnant gutter. (p.4)These children would be labelled \u2018free-range children\u2019 by the disapproving helicopter parents of our time, for they were free to roam around the harbour and to mingle with the fishermen and other working men. Stead does paint a negative portrait of their parents \u2013 not as neglectful \u2013 but rather as irrelevant. By the time Michael is a teenager he has with considerable hostility rejected his mother\u2019s pious Catholicism, and seems relieved to discover that the man who brought him up is not his father after all. It is his presumed biological father who has lifted the family into middle-class respectability by leaving them a substantial legacy, which enables the two older girls to take up university scholarships, and for Michael and his sister to continue their secondary education.To read the rest of my review please visit https://anzlitlovers.com/2016/11/09/s..."}, {"userName": "Mersini", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6599279-mersini", "userReview": "I don't know what to rate this book.
