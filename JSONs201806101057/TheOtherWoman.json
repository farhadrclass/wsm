'The Other Woman' is told by an unnamed narrator whom we follow in spurts throughout the book. She works as a temporary worker in a hospital cafeteria, where she meets a doctor whom she instantaneously develops a crush on. This seems all well and innocent until, as the story unfolds, we learn that he is married, has children of his own, and might not be the honest and virtuous man that we thought he was. Old enough to be her father, their lives begin to interweave and they must determine what the best course of action for their relationship might be.Let me tell you, this is a whirlwind of a book. ...but in a good way. Because it's not a lengthy read (approx 200 pages with large text), it's hard to tell too much without giving it away. Trust me, it's worth your time and effort because it's just so different. It took me a little while to get into - in fact, at about 40% through I was wondering if there was any point at all. But when the pace started to pick up, boy oh boy, it was all I could do to tear myself away for long enough to cook dinner.I will tell you this, though: this was one of those books that I didn't fall in love with immediately. I found myself questioning what was going on, why the characters sometimes didn't make total sense, etc. But immediately after closing the cover and finishing....I just felt like I got it. Like all of the puzzle pieces that kept me from loving it DURING the read fit together so that I could look back upon it fondly AFTER I read it. Not to mention my love for surprise endings...I believe that the story within this book is just the surface of what you can take away from it. It's also to teach us about perceptions - perceptions of ourselves, perceptions of others, perceptions of what we don't know, perceptions of the world. Everything that happens to us is shaped by the way we see it - sometimes even to our own detriment. They often say that \"when one door closes, another one opens,\" but as we see in this twisted story, such is not always the case.This book is art. It's not something that I would take to the beach as something to escape into for hours in the sun. No, this is something you spend a Saturday afternoon reading and then the rest of the next week thinking about. It was like going to a museum and seeing a painting that you don't quite get while you're staring at it, but once you look back you realize that it truly was something beautiful to behold. I can't compare it to anything else I've ever read, but that might be just another reason why I enjoyed it so much.WEBSITE | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12851291-karen", "userReview": "Some real twists.. kept me reading"}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill", "userReview": "This book was fucking perfect.  sjdgiksdhuhgsfd I. just.I don't know how to even write this. I found this in the English Bookshop in S\u00f6dermalm, in a \"Swedish Literature\" section. I judged the cover, as I am unfortunately wont to do -- but I mean, what would you think about a book titled The Other Woman with that cover design? Thank god -- in the interest of finding some 'real Swedish lit' while in Sweden -- I read the back. And, you'll understand, I changed my mind.And I've been disillusioned with my not-so-secret favourite trope, of late -- younger girl and older guy -- because it never gets pulled off quite right. The power dynamic is off; it seems forced or flippant; it ignores the complexity and darkness inherent to the whole situation.The Other Woman doesn't do any of that. It hits every cross-generational note like a spire -- sharp, undeniably present, but slender and subtle. It hits every note it attempts like a fucking spire: the angst of the late 20s. Female friendship. The mutability of relationships. Class difference, the value of education, nostalgia. Family constraints, modern constraints. Independence & difference. Possibility and goals; whether they are achievable. The problematic layers of feminism. What it really means to be honest, or self-aware, or genuine.And most of all: the confused, spinning portrait of a confused, spinning girl.Our nameless (I JUST REALIZED??? what the fuck what the fuck THAT'S HOW ENGROSSING THIS BOOK IS I only JUST REALIZED the protagonist never had a name) leading lady is a mess, but there were...too many times when I saw myself, word for word, in her. And parts of my closest friends. And parts of people I vaguely know. As she contradicts herself and rationalizes and tries to figure out what the fuck she wants, exactly, she resonates ------ deeply.And her story, in barely 200 pages, shows -- does not tell -- more than I honestly thought was possible. Some books hit one note way too hard; some try to do too much -- rare is the book that artfully pulls all its topics together, gently, and leaves most of them up to the reader to pursue, in themselves.I am in love with Stockholm, and this book is vibrantly what I am beginning to suspect is Swedish: rife, brilliant, steeped in history and tradition & cultural and class divides, sparse but seething, absolutely seething, with truth and the kind of sublime beauty you feel when you see the Northern Lights. Fuck."}, {"userName": "Lolly K Dandeneau", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1412404-lolly-k-dandeneau", "userReview": "\"Morals are for those who can afford them,\" I say.Indeed they are here. My favorite part of the book is her talking about not liking the depictions of the working class and how they are always miserable and wretched. \"I grew up with food on the table and an underlying sense of security, but with a lack of culture, a feeling that the world is small, that certain things are meant for other kinds of people.\" So taking up with a successful, privileged, married older man seems to be her way of having one toe in that very world she hasn't been exposed to but also resenting it. The writing is lovely, even if our narrator isn't. Her perception of the world and her place in it is very young and jaded. There is selfishness, but that's a privilege of youth- those of us with experience and years tacked on us 'can't afford it' in the same way some in this novel 'can't afford morals.\" She is numb and searching for something to pull her from her monotony, I think. She is not likable and I can already hear some married women judging 'the young tramp'. Really, isn't the man to blame-hmmm, just a little? Or a lot?Things get strange when she meets Alex, who seems smitten with her. There is an erotic charge between the two women, but nothing is as it seems. There are times it's obvious she just wants to live what she imagines is an 'interesting' life. Being young, lonely, hard working, that's all common and such a waste of her mind and soul. This is a woman who wants to feel and live, really live- but may get tangled up in complications. The ending may be predictable to the entitled, I found it distasteful. I wanted her to grow and change, and I don't feel she did, I feel she is worse off- more jaded for having rubbed shoulders and a whole lot more with her chosen 'lover'. Maybe the conclusion she comes to is true of many lives. Maybe many people do make so many concessions in life that the fire dies inside. Maybe doors only open for some through deception- so many worlds spinning in all of us - the haves and the have nots and all those in between. Not a happy read, but something about it pulled me in."}, {"userName": "Rebecka", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6476980-rebecka", "userReview": "Amazing.

Far from it. Instead this is a dark physiological study of a young woman who may well be a sociopath.Our unnamed, first person narrator, is a young woman who works a menial job in a hospital cafeteria, but has high literary aspirations to become a novelist. She grew up, and still lives in a small college town in Sweden. As a narrator, she is my favorite kind of \"unreliable\"; she does not try to make herself sympathetic to the reader. She's completely amoral and she makes no excuses. She disdains almost everyone, especially other women (save one), and believes that to have feminine power is to do whatever one desires - regardless of the cost. She is completely delusional and she makes horrific choices. Does she do what she does to bring excitement to her mundane life - or simply have something to write about?This is a spare story told with elegant prose and astounding honesty. 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "johannaevida", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4499073-johannaevida", "userReview": "Det klara v\u00e5rvinterljuset i kombination med den h\u00e4r boken levererade en nostalgiskt bitterljuv k\u00e4nslococktail.

It\u2019s witty, provocative and thoughtful about money, class, what it is to have less and desire more, to be educated and smart but not particularly suited to anything. Swedish author Therese Bohman examines societal expectations of what makes a complete life: a good job; a happy coupling; a nice place. All the things by which we define ourselves but realize the innate superficiality of it all. If we focus on the having and not the feeling and the experiencing then we lack integrity, depth and strength of character. A young woman works at the bottom of a hospital hierarchy as a kitchen aide. Of interacting with her co-workers, she comments: \u201cTo them I am someone who has been to college, unlike them, and that creates a distance.\u201d She meets and begins an affair with an older married doctor named Carl Malmberg. While there\u2019s passion and connection, she knows that he thinks her beneath him and will always feel that way. While this independent woman remains resolute in her thoughts and convictions, the relationship causes her to doubt herself and her future goals.\u201cPerhaps I ought to become a teacher or a librarian, surely not everyone who follows those career paths can feel passionate about them, they have simply chosen a route and followed it through, that is how people live: they make a choice and stick to it, whether it is a matter of education and training or a job or a partner. I have never been able to do that. I always think that I have an uncompromising attitude to life in that respect, an attitude that makes things difficult to me, but which I cannot talk myself out of. I have the same attitude about everything: people, clothes, literature.\u201dIn embracing and exploring her femininity, this young woman questions feminism. Understandable that many young women think that to be a feminist one cannot also be feminine. She seems at odds with her peers in their revolt of certain \u201cfeminine\u201d things. By such conscious questioning she\u2019s defining her own version of feminism as every woman should do. It\u2019s a myth that\u2019s been carried throughout the years. She notes: \u201cFemininity was an intricate network of rules with a minimal amount of leeway, where everything was unspoken in the bargain.\u201d Then she says this: \u201cI am a failure as a feminist woman. I am a failure as a perfectly ordinary woman as well, I am too clever\u2014I said that to Emelie once when I was drunk, she got angry with me, really angry, she looked at me as if I was a traitor.\u201d She may think this but in living as she\u2019s living and in desiring equality and certain standing she\u2019s without doubt a feminist. When a woman questions herself and her feminism, she\u2019s inherently a feminist. She makes an intriguing new friend named Alex. She confides in her about the affair. She remarks: \u201cTalking to her about it feels sexy too, I like Alex\u2019s smile because it is hungry and inviting, not in terms of eroticism perhaps but in terms of life, or adventure . . .\u201d In both the affair and this friendship she\u2019s discovering herself and blooming. Perhaps re-thinking her present situation and contemplating a writer\u2019s lifestyle. This is the best novel I\u2019ve read so far this year. As someone who has yet to find her path, I completely relate to this character. She\u2019s somewhat stuck at the moment but not accepting and not giving up. Also she\u2019s by herself and isn\u2019t that why we often read novels? If not to escape, then to find kindred spirits. She notes: \u201cI am an expert when it comes to being alone. I have always been alone, because no one else is like me.\u201d I think to myself: me too. It\u2019s not the standard, predictable novel about an affair. It\u2019s twisty and existential. I dare not give away too many details. --review by Amy Steele, originally posted here: http://entertainmentrealm.com/2016/03..."}, {"userName": "Katie_la_geek", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067661-katie-la-geek", "userReview": "review and rating to come"}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3849889-linda", "userReview": "An interesting story about a young woman that becomes the mistress of a married doctor. She doesn't think about the problems that might follow, and when they do, she becomes even more destructive.It is a story about the life of a mistress, but also about the other woman, in a bigger perspective. The main character feels misplaced everywhere. Among other women, among well educated people and among students. Even among the working class, despite her working in a hospital restaurang, because she thinks that stories about the working class are often about extreme misery, and she can't identify with them because she is having a rather decent life, after all.She wants so much, but doesn't have the tools for it. She wants to study literature and be an author, but doesn't have the courage. In some ways, she is different from many women. She is tired of feminism and thinks that instead of liberating themselves, women have made new, feminist, restricted norms to follow. She is also tired of certain people of the middle class that know how privileged they are, and carefully describe the power structures and norms, but even though they know all this, and pretend to be humble and not condemnatory, they despise people like her anyway.The book is provoking because of the main characters view of femininity, but at the same time it is fascinating.

But then, the narrator considered her otherness to be so central- she did not belong. She was not a believer in the sisterhood, she refused to be governed by the sisterhood, by other women. She hated the so-called fact that she was just another other, she did not want to be like all the rest. But that damn feeling of loneliness, of separateness was so hard to handle and her fleeting feelings of belongingness was so good with Carl albeit that he was a fraud, still good even though he paid her to go to Stockholm. Stockholm, was her way out so to speak, but this reader is left with the feeling that her loneliness will be with her wherever she goes.

The Other Woman by Swedish writer Therese Bohman (translated by Marlaine Delargy) is such a book, and possibly one of the best books I have read even though 2016 is only half over.The protagonist of The Other Woman is nameless and faceless. She is fairly young, has some college education, and desires to be a writer. However, she works at a hospital cafeteria and her so-called writing seems to be limited to thinking about it, not exactly doing it.Feeling at loose ends, and desiring some excitement in her predictable life, our protagonist develops a crush on a much older, successful doctor named Carl Malmberg. Dr. Malmberg is on his second marriage and has children with both is first and second wife. It isn\u2019t long before our protagonist starts an affair with the doctor. She is attracted to his success and maturity and he is attracted to her youth and how she seems to put him on pedestal, obeying his every lead.It is there I should have closed the book in disgust. I\u2019ve been cheated on and it isn\u2019t a picnic. It hurts. However, I was so compelled by this woman\u2019s story that I couldn\u2019t stop reading it like her story was a literary drug.The protagonist isn\u2019t just the \u201cother woman\u201d in the literal sense, the mistress sense. She is the other woman in how she relates to her co-workers who entertain themselves with idle chatter and gossip, her friendships with people vastly more educated and successful than her, and yes, with her lover, Dr. Malmberg. She willingly shares her body with him, but she doesn\u2019t share her life. Though she desires more, she knows exactly what she is to Dr. Malmberg, an escape from the day to day life of being a doctor, husband and father.It at this time our protagonist sparks up a friendship with a young woman named Alex. Alex is confident and magnetic, and the protagonist can\u2019t help but get caught up in Alex\u2019s intoxicating allure. Their relationship borders on the erotic. I must say the reason made sense to me but also made me gasp out loud once I found out why. Blackmail, trickery, betrayal all play a part in the lives of our protagonist, Dr. Malmberg and Alex. And once these elements play out, the reader doesn\u2019t clutch the pearls in disgust. Instead, instead one might think, \u201cWell, sometimes you have to be a less than a good person to get things done and certain things out of the way.\u201dOr as our protagonist states,\u201d \u201cMorals are for those who can afford them.\u201d And in a world where being a less than ethical is rewarded or at least ignored, can any of anybody afford morals?The Other Woman is written with a bittersweet pathos, our protagonist both wise and at times, infuriating. You relate to her longing and her loneliness. You relate to her desire to belong and her feelings of being above it all. You relate to her longing to have connections that are both carnal and cultural. But perhaps most of all, you want the protagonist to learn to develop a stronger sense of self in a confusing world that denies those things, especially for women. I\u2019m older than the protagonist and I\u2019m still struggling with this.But not all is lost. There are layers of hope in The Other Woman as it draws to its close. Our protagonist starts a new journey, one that you wish is more fulfilling and where every wish she desires comes true, and perhaps one where she will learn to like herself just a bit more. Maybe Bohman will write a sequel, but I don\u2019t exactly want her to at this point. For now let\u2019s keep The Other Woman\u2019s next step be a mystery and left up to the reader\u2019s imagination.Originally published at The Book Self:https://thebookselfblog.wordpress.com..."}, {"userName": "Bonnie Brody", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630898-bonnie-brody", "userReview": "Therese Bohman writes beautifully. Her translator, Marline Delargy, creates a seamless narrative that is as organic as birch buds slowly turning to leaves in the spring. Together, they make a wonderful team. The narrative is haunting, erotic, existential, euphoric and tragic in turns.Our unnamed narrator is a woman in her 20's who works in a hospital cafeteria but sees herself as a writer. She is a loner in the Swedish city of Norrkoping. She thinks that the city is a vestibule for the uncultured, that there is nothing special about the people who live there, herself included. She comes from a working class background and vacillates between hopes to move forward with her education to a sense of futility of ever going anywhere other than the moldy hospital cafeteria where she has worked for some time.One day she sees a senior physician in the cafeteria and she immediately fantasizes about a relationship with him. It so happens that he sees her waiting for a bus outside of the hospital and asks her if she'd like a ride home. Things develop from there and she views him as her great love despite his being twice her age and married with children. She fantasizes about his wife dying, about his leaving his wife for her, about them building their own life together.What struck me most about this short novel is the narrator's unstable sense of self, her self-loathing and existential dread. She is self-focused and very passive, giving in to other's requests as thought they are demands on her very being. What begins as a story about 'the other woman' becomes a twisted tale of surprises and events that become shocking and horrendous in their capacity for destruction.I love the way Ms. Bohman writes and plan to read her other books. She writes like a quintessential poet-philosopher with a bit of psychoanalytic exploration thrown in. This is not a book I will soon forget. In fact, it will trouble me for some time to come."}, {"userName": "Petra", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28393395-petra", "userReview": "The unnamed protagonist is The Other Woman, the one who starts an affair with a married man who could be her father. He is a respected wealthy doctor working in the hospital where she works as a temporary catering assistant. But she really wants to be a writer, she also wants to live, really live. Instead, she feels alone, pretty much all of the time. Translated from Swedish, I was expecting some atmospheric descriptions of places and people. But instead the first-person present tense narrative felt strained and the protagonist just came across as arrogant and egotistical. I particularly despised the way she was talking about the lady with special needs who worked with her in the hospital. It's quite a short book, but I felt there was so much theorizing and unnecessary padding, that it would have worked better as an even shorter story. Let's face it, there wasn't much happening. The reason I am even giving it 2 stars is the fact that there were two or three good twists that I hadn't expected and that kept me reading to the end. Unfortunately, the end wasn't satisfying either. I had hoped for some personal growth, but the protagonist just remained this aloof person I felt no connection with. I kept wondering what had made her into this person, but I never found an answer. Not a happy read, maybe interesting if you're into extended debates about feminism, class and society.
