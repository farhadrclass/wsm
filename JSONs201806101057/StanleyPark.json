Not surprising, perhaps, as the book spends a lot of time describing the city: the disparity between rich and poor, the exceptional natural beauty, the pretension of the foodie-hipsters who live here and then, in great detail, the landscape of the largest park (and biggest tourist attraction), Stanley Park. The protagonist, Jeremy, is an idealistic young chef who owns a hip restaurant and cooks (magnificent) locally sourced meals. The plot thickens as his restaurant struggles to maintain financial solvency, and thickens further as the plot detours to follow Jeremy\u2019s father, \u201cThe Professor\u201d who lives IN Stanley Park as part of an ethnographic study of homeless folks who live in the park AND investigating a cold case murder of two children. I suppose there are some ways in which these two plot lines intersect: Jeremy visits his father in the woods, thematic parallels around local food and local/post-national belonging. But for this reader it felt very much like two plot lines jammed together without the necessary exposition making it clear why a murder mystery and foodie romance belong together. Indeed, even with careful reading I\u2019m still unsure about who/how the murder was committed, why it was significant for Jeremy and what implications it had for The Professor. So here\u2019s how I take it:The restaurant plot and Jeremy is great. The writing is decent, the descriptions of food and cooking are great and the questions around independent/small business v conglomerate are interesting and worth exploring.The Stanley Park plot is terrible. The descriptions try so hard to be literary and poetic that it\u2019s entirely unclear to this reader what is happening, to whom and why. More importantly, I still don\u2019t know why I should care about this plot line. What does it have to do with the local food? with food security? Hmm. I\u2019ve been telling folks this is a great read (and it did help me past my \u201cLet The Great World Spin\u201d hangover) but in writing this I\u2019m not sure its great so much as the one strand of the novel is great. Can part of a novel be great and the other part terrible and the sum be something like average? I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s still worth reading for the gorgeous food bits, just don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re reading and wondering what the hell this Czech guy is doing living on Lion\u2019s Gate Bridge. And maybe also don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re a little annoyed with the editor of this book who failed Taylor in not telling him that you can\u2019t just jam two plot flavours together and hope for a satisfying read."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137566-kate", "userReview": "I'm not going to finish this. I don't care about the protagonist, the oh-so-passionate chef who wants to serve \"high end rubber-boot food.\" (Seems like that describes about about half the chef population, but this is painted as some sort of laudable, novel goal.) I don't care about the secondary characters, especially his father, who lives in a public park as part of an anthropology project on the homeless and is enigmatically remote and weird. Pages and pages of description about how the author used to be in a band has so far not inspired me to care that the author used to be in a band. And I definitely, definitely do not care about the protagonist's devotion to local food. OH MY GOD shut up already. This was written in 2001, when the local food thing was perhaps not as thoroughly over-hyped as it is now. But it's 2009, and WE GET IT already. The book is taking itself very seriously. And the whole thing feels like a pre-write. It needs thinning. Would I be more invested if this story about local food were more local to me? If the main character's father were living in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park instead of Vancouver's Stanley Park? If the protagonist's precious \"Monkey's Paw Bistro\" (hello, annoying name) were located in SOMA? Maybe, but doubt it. Sorry to be so cranky. And in a way I'm sorry that I can't seem to drag myself through to the part where everything goes awry, and he gets bought out by Starbucks, and then solves a really old murder mystery. But life is short. Maybe I'll flip to the end."}, {"userName": "Amanda Leduc", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4788045-amanda-leduc", "userReview": "On the surface, Stanley Park is a simple, albeit fiendishly entertaining, story. Chef Jeremy Papier runs an up-and-coming restaurant in Vancouver -- a restaurant that's devoted to local food, and local atmosphere. The 100 Mile Diet shoved into a little place in Crosstown. He's head chef, and his good friend (and potential romantic interest) Jules Capelli is his sous chef, pastry chef, and restaurant partner in crime. Life is hectic (what life isn't, when restaurants are involved), and there's a niggling disquiet introduced in the first interactions that Jeremy has with his father -- an anthropologist in the midst of a submersive study on the homeless in Vancouver's Stanley Park -- but when the reader is first introduced to all involved, life seems on the whole to be good. Naturally, of course, things are not so. Jeremy has money issues. His restaurant, though popular and decidedly hip, is losing money. Jeremy is, in fact, in deep shit -- shit that becomes all the more apparent when his scrambling debt finally comes to the attention of his original restaurant investor, Dante Beale.Dante is a business man and neighbour of Jeremy's father, and he runs a hugely successful chain of coffee houses in Vancouver called Inferno. (Some articles on the novel have highlighted the obviousness of these monikers, but as a gal who has done some obvious character naming in her time, I found them hilariously fun.) Dante has also been wanting to get his hands on Jeremy's restaurant for some time, much to the chagrin of the lovely sous-chef, and this all comes to a head about halfway through the book, when Jeremy must finally go to Dante and admit his money failures.Running parallel to the restaurant woe is another storyline involving Jeremy and his father, the Professor. As mentioned, the Professor is doing a study on the homeless people who live in Stanley Park. While initially somewhat estranged, Jeremy's own fascination with local food and what it means inevitably draws him closer to his father's world. The closeness that develops between the two men over the course of the novel was, I felt, a beautiful thing to watch. Guarded at first, but unfolding slowly, like the trees themselves ...Anyway. Big Bad Dante steps in, finally, and takes the restaurant over. Guts the place. Hires Jeremy's new paramour (a beguiling -- and yet oddly repulsive, in a you're-too-charming-to-be-true kind of way -- girl named Benny) as the new decorator, and proceeds to turn the restaurant into precisely the kind of uber-hip, urban fusion cuisine juggernaut that Jeremy's spent his whole career fighting quietly against.What a bastard! (Can you say bastard in a book review? Oh well.) Oooh, the transformation of the restaurant got me so mad. But the descriptions of the food were delicious, and my faith in Jeremy Papier strong, and so I continued ...I don't think I can say much more without giving away the plot, but the resolution of this novel basically staggered me with its brilliant execution. Reading the latter half of this novel was like watching one continuous panned shot of a sophisticated, culinary art film. (I doubt that \"culinary art\" is a film genre, but it should be. Fact.) Bright flashing colours and subterfuge and good-looking people all over the place. Again -- fiendishly entertaining. So, so good.But what lifted this book above mere entertainment for me, and put it into that realm of the Seleckys and the Atwoods, was how Taylor managed to combine his restaurant narrative and his anthropological narrative in such a fantastic conclusion at the end. So good. This is a novel of ideas that somehow also manages to be a novel of concrete textures and people and colours. It's fun, but also hugely important, and while this might sound simple, too often these are hard things to achieve all at the same time. (This is where my you'll never be this good ever ever voice kicks in.)Somehow, though, Taylor does it. And he does it all in such a fun, funny, entertaining way, with language that's straight and clean while still managing to be breathtaking and innovative all at the same time.So this is a book that's floored me, basically. This is the kind of novel -- not least of all because it's about food -- that makes me want to be a writer, to be a person who can use her words well, and build a world that makes the reader see their own world differently, even after the book's conclusion. Of course it's not perfect (though I'm pretty darn close to thinking of it so) -- the build up to Jeremy's financial meltdown lasts maybe a little longer than it should, and Benny shifts out of Jeremy's life rather quickly in the last third of the book -- but overall these are tiny, tiny niggles. I loved every inch of this novel. I wish there was a sequel. I'm going to read and re-read this and savour the language every time."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/186838-jessica", "userReview": "Love food?

Written in 2001, but set a few years earlier, Stanley Park is much more grounded in reality \u2013 until it isn\u2019t. Set in post-Expo, pre-Olympics Vancouver \u2013 a time when I also lived in the city and was deeply involved in civic history projects \u2013 the novel circles around notions of rootedness. Following the string of connectedness back to whatever it\u2019s tied to is financially-challenged Jeremy Papier, a red-hot up and coming chef with a string of maxed out credit cards and an unacknowledged crush on his culinary partner. Also following what turns out to be a not-so-different string is Jeremy\u2019s grieving and estranged father, The Professor, a self-declared immersive-anthropologist ostensibly studying the homeless in Stanley Park, but perhaps closer to both home and homelessness than his son thinks.For those unfamiliar with Vancouver, Stanley Park is the green heart of the city, less accessible and wilder than NYC\u2019s Central Park, but alike in its stubbornness to be commoditized at the break-neck speed of the rest of one of North America\u2019s most expensive cities. Established in 1888, it\u2019s completely surrounded by water, except for a slender isthmus; it is connected to the city\u2019s north shore by the spectacular (if crumbling) Lion\u2019s Gate Bridge (if you were ever wondering where Lion\u2019s Gate Films got its name from). The park is a piece of land worth a gazillion dollars and it\u2019s actually pretty easy to get lost if you stray from the paths. The park, with its legends and its history, is profoundly \u201clocal\u201d, a theme that comes up again and again in Tayor\u2019s story of passion, regret, and \u2013 food.Oh, yes, there\u2019s food. Fellow foodies, keep in mind that this story is set well before the farm-to-table movement was in full swing. Jeremy\u2019s devotion to what is seasonal and local \u2013 and not disguising it with painful fusion-for-fusion\u2019s-sake acrobatics \u2013 was crisp at the time this novel is set, and possibly at the time it was written. I savoured the ecstatic descriptions of walk-in freezers. Indulgent discussion of knife work, bordering on fetishism? Oh, yes, please. And rather like The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover (remember that movie?), the chef ends up with the last laugh, in ways that are better described than imbibed. The \u201cBabes in the Woods\u201d story of Stanley Park is (mostly) true. What many people don\u2019t know is that the skeletal remains of two children found in the park in the 1950s are only two of the many bodies that turn up in the park every so often. It\u2019s that kind of park, and Taylor deftly weaves their story with the Professor\u2019s deep reconnaissance mission to understand a cast of intriguing (and mostly male) homeless people. In the end, food and home \u2013 and the mystery of the murdered children \u2013 all come together in one unforgettable evening.Is Taylor\u2019s vision of homelessness and the top chef restaurant world an exercise in gritty realism? Hell, no. But it doesn\u2019t really matter. Although this is definitely a page-turner, some of Taylor\u2019s phrases stopped me in their tracks with their beauty and their sharp observation. Jeremy\u2019s emotional state as he fast forwards into ruinous debt is described as a \u201cchain of open links, waiting for some critical slackening of tension to disassociate themselves one from another\u2026\u201d With writing like this, the occasional lapses are more noticeable, perhaps. Dante Beale, the grain-fed epitome of corporate greed, is too on-the-nose. He owns a coffee chain called Inferno. He plays chess. And he\u2019s called Dante, for pete\u2019s sake. Likewise, some lesser characters veer into caricature, but Taylor\u2019s right on the money for the important bits. It\u2019s not really a \u2018slice of life in Vancouver circa 1996\u2019; it\u2019s a fabulist\u2019s tale of youthful folly, understanding fathers and father figures, and what back to the land really means."}, {"userName": "Maayan K", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17639553-maayan-k", "userReview": "I basically hated this book by the end of it. There's a lot of potentially interesting thematic stuff in it (homelessness in public parks, foodiness, groundedness/sense of place, Vancouver itself), but the whole thing is a hot mess that had me skimming just to get to the goddamn end by final quarter.Jeremy Papier is a young and talented chef trying to make a farm-to-table restaurant float in crosstown in the late 90s when this was still a new thing. His father is an eccentric anthropologist living in Stanley Park with homeless people. As Jeremy struggles financially, he gets sucked into his father's life in the park at nighttime.There are so many pointless side/back/off-stories that add nothing. Example: the main character's mother's history, the detailed backstory of homeless people in the park, an unsolved murder, a uncanny god-child, something about first nations people recolonizing the park? None of these things matter in the least. The dialogue is terrible. The late-nineties setting feels dated, and the stuff that should be cool just isn't anymore: \"the Monkey's Paw Bistro\"? ugh eew. Even the central love interest is romantic-comedy shallow: attraction, obstacle, resolution. The pacing of the book is horrible - you just want it to be over by the first main plot turn. The final denouement is the longest most drawn out piece of sappy pointlessness I've read in a while. The most annoying thing about it stylistically is the faux-mysterious faux-cryptic \"poetic\" tone adopted at various passages, mostly as Jeremy is wandering around Stanley Park. Maybe the author thinks he's being edgy and cool by having bizarre non sequiturs or leaving simple chronological events mysteriously unfinished, but it is merely ridiculous and artificial. No, you cannot convince me that there is something 'deep' to be gleaned from all this - except maybe that this author tries very, very, hard.The most successful parts of the book are around food, and take place in and around Jeremy's restaurant kitchen. Jeremy himself isn't a wholly uninteresting character (though pretty much everyone else is). A simpler story about a new restaurant in financial trouble and a complicated relationship with a father would have been so, so much better. This is a book where the flaws of form and content are deeply connected, and there's no easy fix - even an editor taking a hack at it wouldn't work because almost the whole thing is devoted to tangents with no beauty, no emotion, and no real stakes. Maybe very loosely-based movie could work."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5341034-dawn", "userReview": "After the first few chapters I thought for sure that this book was going to be a struggle to finish. It was bizarre and crazy. But somehow those weird characters, strange ideas and curious happenings turned into an enthralling read. The author really knows Vancouver. He caught the attitudes of the hippie vs. hipster vs. corporate vs. homeless that made it obvious he's lived and been a part of this city. The entire story revolves around the son and his cooking. Which kind of makes it sound like a foodie story but I found it good even though I am not usually a fan of food descriptions (I don't cook and don't care to learn, thus not making me very interested). The characters include the homeless (maybe crazy), a corporate bigwig, chefs, a librarian and lots of credit (trust me it's almost a character).The nemesis Dante, his business and his attitude were a favorite part for me. He's a successful creep and I wonder who he's based on because he kinda reminds me of Chip Wilson (lululemon founder).Somehow a jumble of people and stories managed to be cohesive and engaging."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1599573-david", "userReview": "When about half of the way through this book I would have given it a 3-star rating but an interesting (if somewhat predictable) ending bumped my score up a bit.

Other reviewers have complained about the lengthy descriptions of food and its preparation, but I found this aspect of the book to be very enjoyable and educational.

Culturally speaking, I feel a closer affinity to British Columbians than Americans residing on the Eastern Seaboard. Even if my national allegiance lies with a New Yorker, my culinary tradition, weather, and regional tongue align with a Vancouverite. Given the regional connections between Seattle and Vancouver, I thoroughly enjoyed Timothy Taylor\u2019s novel, Stanley Park. Culinary Crips versus Bloods Set in Vancouver at the beginning of the new millennium, Stanley Park tells the story of Chef Jeremy Papier. Upon completing training in France, Jeremy returns to his native British Columbia, inspired to run a restaurant imparting simple and locally rooted dishes for the Vancouver public. Jeremy\u2019s inspiration extends from his culinary training. \u201cCrips versus Bloods. Crip cooks were critical. They fused, they strove for innovation, they were post-national. They called themselves artists. They tended to stack things like mahi mahi and grilled eggplant in wobbly towers glued together with wasabi mayonnaise, and were frequently suspicious of butter. Vegetarianism was an option for Crips but not for Bloods. Blood cooks were respectful of tradition, nostalgic even. Canonical, interested in the veracity of things culinary, linked to \u2018local\u2019 by inheritance or adoption of a culture, linked to a particular manner and place of being. Blood cooks liked sweetbreads and pot-au-feu. Bloods ate tacos, bratwurst, borscht. They used lard and as much foie gras as they could get their hands on. They made cassoulet to the recipe left by Louis Cazals and, depending on where the Bloods called home, they might like kimchi, salmon planked on cedar, fish stew with sausage, or twice-cooked duck.Chef Jeremy Papier was Blood\u201d (32-33).Partnering with a talented culinary artist named Jules and funded by local entrepreneur and childhood neighbor Dante Beal, Jeremy opens the Monkey\u2019s Paw Bistro. The Kite of Debt Despite critical acclaim, debt mounts as Jeremy strains to keep the restaurant afloat. \u201cPeople rarely set out to kite in a controlled way. More often financial kites soar out of sight with terrifying speed, the virtual string burning through your fingers. Jeremy could remember precisely how his own went aloft. It started with his line of credit at the Toronto Dominion Bank, $230,000 guaranteed by Dante Beale\u201d (54).Struggling to survive, Jeremy soon finds the reins of his restaurant in the hands of Dante, his financier. CEO of Inferno Coffee, an obvious allusion to Starbucks, Dante represents everything Jeremy hates\u2014the Crip to his Blood. When a Blood Becomes a Crip A perpetual profit maximizer, Dante shuts down The Monkey\u2019s Paw and remodels the restaurant for a grand opening as Gerriamo\u2019s, a post-national restaurant and product of extensive market research. Dante maintains the employment of Jeremy as executive chef but the arrangement leaves Jeremy bitter and his friend, Jules, unemployed. As Gerriamo\u2019s grand opening inches closer, Jeremy plans the best menu he has ever prepared. Stanley Park: A Homeless Sanctuary In addition to this narrative thread resides a secondary story surrounding Jeremy and his father, a professor studying the homeless of Stanley Park. Living with the park inhabitants, Jeremy\u2019s dad receives uninterrupted access to these peripatetic people. While studying, the professor encounters the story of the Babes in the Wood, Stanley Park\u2019s unsolved murder mystery from the early 50s when the skeletons of two young boys were found in the dense forest of the city park. Requesting library research from Jeremy, the father and son draw close as Jeremy relays information about the case and becomes accustomed to the inhabitants and dining rituals of Stanley Park. \u201cThen he lay back in the ferns to let it all flow over him. Jeremy stood at the centre of his own diagram, the Professor thought. In the thick of his own woods. A joined drama. People turning against the wind, returning to Eden. Those seeking reconciliation with the stable rhythms of the earth, with their own beginnings. Here, in the park, where out of desperation, for lack of options, a living theatre of rootedness had been reborn from distant tragedy. In Jeremy\u2019s kitchen, where a sense of lost connection played out in culinary theatrics about the return to a familiar soil\u201d (194).Global or Local?As the two narratives intertwine, questions of culture, rootedness, and place in a globalized society become apparent. Which aspects of life are we willing to submit to the tides of global commerce? Which ones will we fight tooth and nail for? I find the topics of Stanley Park particularly current despite being a decade old. With society questioning food in the wake of Food, Inc. and The Omnivore's Dilemma, Stanley Park offers a fictional addition to this \u201cfood\u201d canon. Even though I struggled at times to discover the connections between the novel\u2019s storylines, I enjoyed the local flavor of Stanley Park. A product of Cascadia, the culinary tradition of Vancouver resembles Seattle\u2019s tradition. I enjoyed the themes present in Stanley Park and applaud Taylor\u2019s writing.
