His story deals with money laundering, fraud, manipulation, with a very driving force of true love. There's something here for everyone. The main character is Mike King, who leaves the school of medicine to explore the world for a year, then returns to major in chemical engineering as inspired by an oil magnet friend of his father. The second character is Karen Taylor, daughter of wealthy parents, who loves Mike King. But while he is on his one year sabbatical, Karen and her friend Patti Archer are on a hijacked Boeing 707 which winds up in a devastating explosion near Damascus. Mike is devastated to think Karen has been killed, goes back to school, and soon marries Barbara Larkin. The third character is Jim Servito who has a brilliant mind, is cynical, and one of the most ruthless characters that Mike and Karen will have to face. He's blackmailed his way to riches and through money laundering, and without remorse, he will strike down anyone who stands in his way.This book reveals the roots of the gasoline wars and shortages of the early 70's. It deals with Mike's failed marriage and also his success of rising from being an employee to having his own oil company. It gives one a first hand, factual look at how big businessmen wheel and deal to increase their profits ... or to prevent losing them.This story would make a powerful movie, if Hollywood had the courage to get it to the silver screen. There's only one actor I envision playing the ruthless Jim Servito ... Al Pacino! This is a stellar story one which you won't be able to put down, and one you will never forget."}, {"userName": "Edward Wolfe", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18779163-edward-wolfe", "userReview": "Great book that kept me up all night, constantly having to find out what was going to happen - the way Patterson's books used to do. (You know, back when Patterson wrote them himself.)I don't feel that the characters were really fleshed out, and some things were glossed over, and sometimes I was surprised when it would jump forward several years, and despite all of that, it still kicked ass and I can't believe the author made the entire trilogy free. With the first book being that compelling, I'd think that a wiser marketing move would be to make the first one free. If the following books were reasonably priced, I would definitely be buying them to continue the saga. But I have them at no cost. Thanks, Mr. Douglas!The writing was really good and mostly well edited and proofed, which made it a surprise when I'd come to a blatant error. After several errors, I started highlighting them in my Kindle with the thought of letting the author know about them, because he can't realize they're there, and it's a shame they are in such a compelling story.But since the story was so good, they were forgivable. This time! Just kidding.Great book. If you like tales that span many years and feature romance, crime, danger and suspense, you'll like this. (It's also an eye-opener to the oil industry - at least as it was in the 60's and 70s, and that gave the book a flavor somewhat similar to Atlas Shrugged, but without any deep thoughts.)"}, {"userName": "Bob Rector", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13861559-bob-rector", "userReview": "After reading Steve Douglas\u2019s new thriller The Bridge To Caracas, I promise you\u2019ll never again feel the same about pulling up to a gas pump. And once you start filling your tank, you\u2019ll wonder what you\u2019re filling your tank with. And the thought of that will probably cause your spine to tingle. Thanks Steve.The driving force of this fast-paced story, set in the 60s and 70s, is the cutthroat world of gasoline distribution among indie Canadian and U.S. suppliers primarily for the purpose of undercutting the majors and evading taxes. Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake and greed and malice rise to the surface like oil on water.Steve Douglas knows of which he writes. His career in the oil industry spanned 30 years working for two of the largest companies in the business before starting his own business. The complicated schemes of the players involved all have the ring of truth.Caught up in this diabolical world are star-crossed lovers Mike King and Karen Taylor. They are headed for the altar but are separated by events neither could have imagined. When the two find each other again, both are married, but are still desperately in love with each other and know they always will. Unfortunately, the man Karen married, Jim Servito, is evil personified.Servito is also the kingpin of the gas underworld and has no qualms about eliminating the competition anyway necessary. He is a character so vile that after reading a passage he\u2019s in, you want to go wash your hands.Mike King is also a small time gas supplier but an honest one. And he\u2019s determined to get Karen back, especially after Servito brutalizes her. What ensues is a battle royale from Canada to South America, with the Feds joining in the fight. Who will come out on top is anybody\u2019s guess. One thing is certain, there will be blood.If you enjoy action packed thrills and adventure with a heavy dose of romance thrown in, this is the book for you.

It confirmed all I've ever thought about big business and the way they operate. This novel concerns skulduggery in the oil business, crossed lovers and a few shoot-outs. Plenty of action, involving love, money and power and the unimportance of the little people who risk getting crushed beneath the vast behemoth of the oil interests.You'll learn things you might prefer not to know about the end product: and when you consider the same obsession with profit and lack of concern for the consumer probably exists in every other business, it makes one seriously concerned about the end products we all use, consume or work with whether it be food, water, medicine, household products, whatever (Bhopal and Thalidamide, anyone?).The storyline was well worked-out and well researched and had me wondering what I was actually putting in my tank the next time I filled my car with petrol. Pretty worrying.If you're looking for a well-written thriller about big business, particularly the oil business, how they operate and the lengths they'll go to to wipe out any opposition, then this book should fill the bill nicely.Highly recommended.

Yep, middle of the road. Before I wrote the review, I went back to see if a new version is available. Not at this time.The premise of the story surrounds the love Karen Taylor and Mike King share. It is abruptly interrupted when Karen becomes a hostage and is reported among the dead. Mike is devastated and moves on with his life. During her captivity he graduates from University and becomes involved in the Oil Industry. The nemesis of the story Jim Servito, by chance, also enters the oil industry\u2014the shady side. Again by chance Jim marries Karen. Game on!The pros:I knew very little of commodity trading and backdoor dealing when it comes to refined products. The author describes in great detail how Servito is able to build a corrupt empire by not paying taxes to either the Canadian or US governments. It is an astounding amount, to the tune of $300 million! Wow! I really appreciate the knowledge Mr. Douglas provides the readers. Well done.The cons:Editing: It needs it. I identified over eighty issues. Missing words, wrong tenses and unnecessary filler. In the beginning Mike and Karen are invited to a dinner where Jackie and John Kennedy will be. It\u2019s one paragraph, maybe two. The point is, I really thought this would be explored a little more and then nothing, including his assassination. Yet, when Karen marries Jim, we are inundated with an entire chapter. The word \u2018had\u2019 needs to be fleshed out. At times it is required but many other times it\u2019s a bit jarring.Adverbs: way too many to count. It became maddening at times, especially when describing a conversation. Ex: \u201ccunningly implying he owned the station.\u201d \u201chis larcenous mind not sufficiently stimulated.\u201d Too much description in conversations. Instead of showing, there is way too much telling. Nothing is left for the imagination. Ex: 1)\u201cKaren slowly turned to face Servito, \u2018You\u2019re forgiven,\u2019 she said with a large grin. 2) George Taylor stepped to the microphone at the top of the steps leading to the verandah. There are many others.Sentence structure, There are several times where I had to reread a sentence scratching my head. 1) His face turned red when he found one of Mike clearly shown. We need clearly shown why?2) Servito calmly removed Martin\u2019s key form the pocket of jacket.???? Pocket of jacket???Character development was thin at best. I never felt connected with Mike or Karen. The dialog between them was too much over the top. Way too many exclamation points and silly outbursts. Name tags. Lord. Way, way too many! We are reminded each and every time when someone is speaking, even if it\u2019s only two people. Their names are populated through each and every paragraph. This needs a heavy threshing. I believe if the book is put in the hands of a good editor/proofreader, many of the issues can be remedied, propelling it to a four star. Overall, not a bad read."}, {"userName": "Rick Bylina", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/921098-rick-bylina", "userReview": "The theme of good versus evil sits on top of the question, 'What would you do for love?' Stephen Douglass's book, The Bridge to Caracas, is a heavily plotted story within the murky world of the oil and gas industry that he seems familiar with. It takes place in the 1960s through the 1970s, and centers on how Jim Servito steals boatloads of money from the industry and screws everyone who gets in his way.The story has lots of potential, but neither Mike King, the protagonist, nor Karen Taylor, his love interest engaged me. No spoiler here--Karen is kidnapped by terrorist and presumed dead. Mike moves on and marries the wrong woman. Bad enough. It happens. Karen returns--no big shock--and moves on now that Mike is unavailable. What bothered me is that the convenient plot point of Karen's abduction, which sets up the star-crossed lover theme, seems to have had little emotional effect on Karen. I kept waiting for her horrendous life event to impact her current life and the story. It never materializes. And Mike, this really smart guy, blunders his way through traps set up by Servito to make Mike's life miserable without getting a clue. Mike seems at times to only be aided by chance (admittedly some of it in the beginning by shrewd moves), luck, coincidence, and finally, at the climax, assistance from a total stranger to solve his problem. Even when the women he loves is being brutalized by Servito in the middle of the story, he does nothing for months except to have rendezvous sex. What starts out sharp and thrilling, peters out for me. In the end, the events and actions felt more staged and Mike's actions reckless, reactionary, and without thought more so than realistic--often causing heartache and loss for others. This is not to write that this is a bad book. The writing is fine and premise strong. The middle had copyediting issues, but not too severe. It just lacked the character development and story ending dynamics that should have been there considering the promise of the beginning. I occasionally mention books that should be read fast to skip over the weak points. This would be one of them. I can see lovers of action and adventure stories falling for this story. Had the ending been sharper, this novel might have been a \"4.\" As is, it is slightly above average, a strong \"3\"."}, {"userName": "Kerry Reis", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14800459-kerry-reis", "userReview": "In the early 60\u2019s in Toronto, Mike and Karen have bonded into soul mates, but Mike feels that his destiny is not in medicine as his parents have hoped, so Mike drops out of school and leaves Karen and his home on a solitary trip to discover his true career passion. Karen and a friend heads to Europe and finds herself on a hijacked plane. The plane explodes on an airstrip, and word comes back that there are no survivors. Mike discovers his passion in oil and returns to school to get an engineering degree, but he is devastated to discover the news about Karen and winds up finding solace with another woman at school, which leads to marriage. However, the news about Karen was incorrect and after she is freed from her hostage situation a year later, she discovers the news about Mike\u2019s marriage. Meanwhile, Jim has come to Canada to dodge the draft and found a low-paying job pumping gas at a small station, but is soon introduced to a gas tax evasion scheme tied to international transport of fuel between Canada and the US. So, as Mike finds success wheeling and dealing for a major oil company, Jim is finding success in controlling a major fraud and theft gas conspiracy. However, the crossing of Mike and Jim\u2019s paths become more impending when Jim meets Karen and convinces her to be his wife, a decision she comes to regret. This story is built around a major fraud issue that appeared to be strong in the oil industry along the Canadian-US border in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, and the author is very knowledgeable in creating the thrilling and suspenseful actions arising out of this type of criminal conspiracy. However, the combination of events that separate and bring together the main characters often feel artificially forced, creating some inconsistency in some of the characters in order to build up the danger and thrills in the plot."}, {"userName": "P.S.

I've just finished The bridge to Caracas and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Stephen Douglass writes brilliantly about an industry that he's made his life blood and shares some of the dirt and some of the success of what was, and still is, a pretty rough business. Gasoline (or Petrol as we know it here in Australia) was a boom and bust industry in the seventies and eighties. Fortunes were made by fair means and foul and fortunes were lost just as quickly. Douglass channels the seventies into this story and the era comes to life. It's something about the attitude and something about the lack of government oversight of the times that gives this page turner its momentum. There's also something in Douglass's writing that brings a Sidney Sheldon feel to the book, again adding to the feel of the 70s."}, {"userName": "R.E.

It is clear from the outset that the author understands his subject matter very well, and his passion for this world clearly shines through, however you never feel bogged down with excessive detail of the workings of the oil business. Instead, the heart of the book is characterisation, and each protagonist (whether likeable or not) is well defined and three-dimensional . The villain of the peace, Karen\u2019s husband Jim Servito, is a truly vile individual, capable of doing anything to protect his illegal, debauched lifestyle, and every time the book centres on him, you can almost feel your skin crawl \u2013 a sign of strong characterisation. And with Mike and Karen, you can\u2019t help rooting for them in their fight to remain safe as they are wrong footed at every turn. The pacing throughout is spot on and the story finishes in a satisfactory (if a little contrived) manner, but with the enticing possibility of future adventures \u2013 the book is the first of a trilogy.

Withal, I will continue reading the trilogy because, as I said, he tells a hell of a story, and \"Hey!\" Maybe he will improve."}, {"userName": "Harry Allagree", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8488865-harry-allagree", "userReview": "I found the author's writing style breezy, somewhat hurried, at times a bit outlandish...particularly the poolside battle between the antagonists, Servito et al., & the protagonists, Mike & Karen. There are radical shifts of emotions among the characters throughout the book, except, perhaps, for Servito who is consistently a bad-un from the git go, with no sense of value for anything but his own pleasure & money. To his credit, I found that Douglass somehow able to build an interesting thriller around a sometimes sparse plot & characters who seemed to oscillate between being very perceptive & at other times pretty dumb & unaware. It was interesting enough that I read the book pretty quickly."}, {"userName": "Peggy Holloway", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16441635-peggy-holloway", "userReview": "Loved the story, the plot, the characters and the character development. To me the novel moved slowly in places. If you like to read Jeffrey Archer I think you would love this book. The economic and technical parts of this book were hard for me to follow and I found myself skipping over a lot of it. I worked in the oil industry for many years but as a geophysicist. I had no idea that these things that took place in this book were going on. I was just exploring for oil. Therefore, this book was very educational for me and I love to learn new things while enjoying a novel. I would read anything written by this author. I like his writing style."}], "description": "Librarian Note: Alternate Cover Edition for ASIN: B00DJ5GM14.How was an incredible $325,000,000 theft achieved using The Peace Bridge as a fulcrum?It was a piece of national history.
